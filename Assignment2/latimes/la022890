HARD BARGAINING AHEAD FOR CHAMORRO AND SANDINISTAS 
</P>

<P>
After a congratulatory visit from President Daniel Ortega, opposition leader 
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro began preparing Tuesday for two months of hard 
bargaining with his defeated Sandinista movement over her triumphant 
coalition's program for a "government of national salvation." 
</P>
<P>
The president-elect was immediately confronted with a warning from the 
Sandinista leadership that its militants will "fight without quarter" to 
preserve key programs of their 10-year revolution and with a demand for 
immediate disarmament of the U.S.-backed Contras. 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro named her son-in-law, Antonio Lacayo, to head a transition team that 
will negotiate with Ortega's representatives on the scheduled April 25 transfer 
of power. 
</P>
<P>
The platform of her 14-party National Opposition Union (UNO) calls for dramatic 
changes that would scale down the army and the revolutionary state built up 
over a decade of Sandinista rule and give freer rein to private enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
Her margin of victory in Sunday's upset, 55.2% of the vote to Ortega's 41.8%, 
has raised expectations among her supporters that hundreds of Sandinista party 
officials will be evicted from homes that were seized from the 
pre-revolutionary order and that Sandinista ideology will be purged from school 
texts. 
</P>
<P>
But UNO fell short of the two-thirds majority it needed in the National 
Assembly to make constitutional changes. That means some elements of its 
program, such as ending the constitutionally protected state monopolies on 
banking and foreign trade, will require Sandinista consent. 
</P>
<P>
More important, UNO leaders acknowledge that the Sandinistas' control of the 
army and their ability to mobilize militant supporters in the streets make it 
inevitable that Chamorro's conservative program will be watered down in 
bargaining over the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be harder than the normal transition," said Alfredo Cesar, one 
of Chamorro's closest advisers and a former leader of the Contras, the 
U.S.-backed rebel movement that fought to unseat the Sandinistas. "That means 
the two sides are going to have to sit down and make sure the transition is 
accomplished in a peaceful manner." 
</P>
<P>
Ortega began that process by paying a visit to Chamorro at her home Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"I bring an olive branch of peace," Ortega told her, kissing her on both 
cheeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Come here, my darling," she quipped. "I love you so much." 
</P>
<P>
She added: "There are neither winners nor losers here." 
</P>
<P>
That scene, and Ortega's dramatic concession speech 12 hours earlier, in which 
he promised to abide by the will of the voters, seemed to offer the promise of 
peaceful change in a country torn by nearly a decade of guerrilla war and a 
history of rigged elections. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Ortega read a proclamation of transition demands by the 104-member 
Sandinista Assembly, a consultative body of the party's elite, to thousands of 
cheering supporters in Managua's Revolution Square. 
</P>
<P>
The proclamation warned UNO against any reversal of the Sandinista land 
redistribution program, the sale of banks or mineral rights, cut-backs in 
benefits to wounded Sandinista war veterans and war widows, or mass firing of 
civil servants. It vowed to "defend the integrity" of the 70,000-man Sandinista 
army. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be no steps back from the fundamental conquests of the revolution," 
Ortega said. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders took the speech as a warning that the negotiations will be 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important change in Nicaragua is not that UNO won or the Sandinista 
front went down to defeat but that we are entering a new form of governing, by 
negotiation rather than imposition," said Emilio Alvarez Montalban, another 
Chamorro aide. 
</P>
<P>
Rafael Solis, a Sandinista leader in the National Assembly, said: "These next 
60 days, more than the elections, are going to decide the future of this 
country." 
</P>
<P>
Ortega has not announced his negotiating team, but it is expected to include 
his brother, Gen. Humberto Ortega, who is defense minister. 
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who came here as an election observer and 
stayed to help kick off transition talks, met Tuesday with Gen. Ortega and 
Lacayo, a businessman who managed his mother-in-law's campaign. Carter said he 
hoped there will be a "small foundation for harmonious progress" by the time he 
leaves Nicaragua today. 
</P>
<P>
Carter said the most immediate issue is the disarming of the 10,000-man Contra 
army. About 3,000 are inside Nicaragua and the rest camped in Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
The former American president said the Sandinistas have made "no ultimatum" on 
the Contras. But Solis made it clear that the Sandinistas will not even 
negotiate with UNO on the issues of control or size of the army, which UNO 
pledged to reduce during the campaign, until the Contras are disbanded and 
return to civilian life. 
</P>
<P>
Honduran President Rafael Callejas, who took office last month, said Tuesday 
that the rebels must leave his territory now that a non-Sandinista government 
has been elected.

SUPERVISORS KEEP JAIL MEASURE OFF BALLOT; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE COUNTY'S 
TROUBLE-PLAGUED CORRECTIONS FACILITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Board of Supervisors decided Tuesday not to place a measure on the June 
ballot calling for the creation of a corrections department, instead deciding 
to seek the cooperation of the Sheriff's Department in improving operations of 
the troubled county jail system. 
</P>
<P>
Frustration over Sheriff John Duffy's repeated cost overruns in running the 
jails and recent reports about mismanagement spurred Board Chairman Leon 
Williams and Supervisor George Bailey to draft the proposal that would strip 
control of the jails from the sheriff and turn it over to a corrections 
department. 
</P>
<P>
But, with Duffy's announcement that he will not seek reelection, the remaining 
three board members -- Supervisors Susan Golding, Brian Bilbray and John 
MacDonald -- voted against the proposal, saying they would rather give a new 
sheriff an opportunity to propose and implement jail management reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors, however, unanimously approved a separate motion reserving the 
right to place a similar measure calling for a corrections department on the 
November ballot if the candidates for sheriff fail to offer solutions or 
cooperate with the board to help solve the county's jail woes. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an opportunity to hear from the candidates and the public has an 
opportunity to ask some real hard questions," said Golding, who expressed 
concern that the board had not had enough time to study the proposal and was 
rushing unnecessarily to make a decision now. "I think this debate should be 
continued vigorously until August," which is the deadline for placing a measure 
on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Golding had said earlier that supporting a corrections department now would 
destroy any chance of building "a spirit of cooperation" with the Sheriff's 
Department, which has vigorously opposed such an action. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bailey and Williams welcomed cooperation with the Sheriff's 
Department, they insisted that the only way to ensure accountability is to have 
a board-appointed civilian director running the county's detention facilities. 
Unlike the sheriff -- an elected official who responds independently to voters 
-- a corrections director hired by the supervisors would be under the direct 
control of the board, the two supervisors argued. 
</P>
<P>
"The new sheriff may have the good will and be very cooperative, but the 
sheriff who succeeds him may not," Williams said. "It is better to have the law 
clear rather than depend on somebody's good will." 
</P>
<P>
Bailey added: "Accountability is the main thing. If it was possible to 
immediately establish a department of corrections, I would." 
</P>
<P>
J. Phil Franklin, foreman of the San Diego County Grand Jury that recently 
released a report supporting creation of a corrections department, also 
expressed disappointment with the board's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"All they're doing is postponing a decision that should be made now," Franklin 
said. "When the sheriff overspends by millions . . . and the county is 
powerless to raise taxes, the cost (overrun) must come at the expense of other 
county programs. There is a better way." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to gaining accountability, Williams' and Bailey's interest in 
creating a corrections department was piqued when they heard about the 
financial success achieved by Santa Clara County, which removed control of 
jails from its sheriff and turned it over to a new corrections department in 
January, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
A corrections department that employed correctional officers -- who are 
lower-paid and receive less training than sheriff's deputies -- helped Santa 
Clara County save $6 million during the first 18 months of operation; a savings 
of more than $10 million is expected by June, according to the San Diego County 
Grand Jury report that studied Santa Clara's switch in detention operations. 
</P>
<P>
But a subsequent county staff report, stating that San Diego County could trim 
jail costs by hiring correctional officers without creating a corrections 
department, coupled with Duffy's unexpected announcement that he eventually 
intends to replace all sheriff's deputies working in the jails with 
correctional officers, derailed the move toward a new system. 
</P>
<P>
The three supervisors who opposed placing a measure on the June ballot said 
they did so not because they are against the creation of a corrections 
department but because they had not been persuaded yet that a new system is 
needed to achieve the board's goals. 
</P>
<P>
"There are two issues here that must and will be addressed," Bilbray said. "One 
is that whoever runs the jails must be accountable to the budgetary process, 
and two, we must and will establish a correctional officers system. How we best 
implement these two strategies, however, remains unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
"Several of the (sheriff) candidates said they would be financially 
accountable," Bilbray added. "I think it's time to cooperate, but if they 
don't, I'll support a mandated program."

MEASLES SUSPECTED IN PUPIL'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Public health authorities are investigating the death of a 10-year-old boy to 
determine if the measles epidemic that killed six people elsewhere in Southern 
California during January has now claimed its first San Diego County resident. 
</P>
<P>
Although the county Department of Health Services has not recorded any deaths 
linked to the measles epidemic, the coroner's office has launched an inquiry 
into the death of Hector Lopez, 10, a fourth-grader at Sunset View Elementary 
School in Point Loma. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, who died Thursday after being admitted to Paradise Valley Hospital, 
had contracted measles, as did his brother, according to Jerry Hooper, the 
school's principal. Hector's 12-year-old brother, Richard, a sixth-grade 
student at Sunset View Elementary, was in good condition at Children's 
Hospital, where he was being treated for measles and dehydration, said Mark 
Morelli, a spokesman for the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
County Public Health Officer Dr. Donald Ramras declined Tuesday to speculate on 
what caused the boy's death. "It's highly likely that he at least had measles, 
but at this point we don't even have absolute confirmation that he had 
measles," Ramras said. "Without autopsy results, it's not possible to have an 
absolute, proven diagnosis" of what caused the death. 
</P>
<P>
A coroner's spokesman Tuesday said the investigation won't be complete for at 
least several days. 
</P>
<P>
A measles epidemic has been plaguing Southern California since 1987. It 
generated 3,000 reported measles cases during early 1989, but seemed to wane 
during the last quarter of the year. 
</P>
<P>
However, reported cases in Southern California began to rise dramatically early 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, Riverside and Fresno counties in January reported their highest 
monthly totals since the latest outbreak began. Orange County reported its 
first measles-related death when a 7-month-old baby died from complications 
related to the disease. In San Bernardino County, three residents died during 
January, just two fewer than during all of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the year-end slowdown elsewhere in California, no new cases 
were reported during December in San Diego County. But 11 confirmed cases and 
81 probable cases were reported between Jan. 1 and Friday, said Ramras, adding, 
"Most of the probables typically turn out to be measles, so we're looking at 
something in the neighborhood of 90-odd cases, which would be worse than last 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Ramras cautioned parents against taking needless steps to protect their 
children against the epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that this boy died is of great significance to his family, but it 
doesn't mean that the kids at school have to do anything different," Ramras 
said. "We know from experience that a child with measles will not usually 
spread it to other children at that same school." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Ramras said, not one of 40 cases involving measles-infected children 
at San Diego schools was linked to a secondary cases. "It's not spread at 
school," Ramras said. "That's pretty much the pattern." 
</P>
<P>
State law requires all children to be inoculated against measles and a handful 
of other relatively common communicable diseases before enrolling in school, 
Ramras said. School records confirmed that both Hector Lopez and his brother, 
Richard, had been inoculated before enrolling, Hooper said. 
</P>
<P>
However, late last year, federal health officials recommended that children be 
inoculated twice against measles because the serum now in use is effective only 
95% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
The county Health Services Department recommends that parents have children 
inoculated at 15 months and once again when they enter kindergarten or first 
grade, Ramras said. 
</P>
<P>
But Ramras said the county is unable to provide the second inoculation because 
of funding cuts. In fact, given current federal and state budget proposals, 
"next year we may not have enough money to sustain the immunization activities 
even without the second dose," Ramras said. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral services for the Lopez boy were held Tuesday at St. Jude's Shrine in 
Southeast San Diego, Hooper said. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is concern for the boy's friends and family, there's no need for 
panic, Hooper said. "The whole community has been very, very supportive and 
understanding of the Lopez family. The primary concern at this point has been 
to go through the grieving process for one of our community."

JUDGE REJECTS BID TO REVOKE SILBERMAN BAIL; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE INDICTED BUSINESSMAN'S TRAVEL IS RESTRICTED TO CALIFORNIA, BUT HE 
WILL NOT BE FORCED BY THE COURT TO SEE A PSYCHIATRIST. 
</P>

<P>
A federal judge Tuesday rejected a request by prosecutors to revoke Richard T. 
Silberman's $500,000 bail, but restricted the indicted financier's travels to 
California and ordered him to call court authorities three times a week. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. District Judge Leland C. Nielsen also ruled that there is no reason for 
prosecutors to force the San Diego businessman to see a court-ordered 
psychiatrist, because Silberman is now resting at a San Francisco psychiatric 
clinic after a suicide attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to intense publicity in the wake of Silberman's two-day 
disappearance and attempted suicide earlier this month, Nielsen also said he 
will consider imposing a gag order on attorneys in the money-laundering case. 
The judge also chastised Silberman's defense lawyer for suggesting that 
Silberman could not get a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, reputed mobster Chris Petti and three other men are charged with 
laundering $300,000 given them by an undercover FBI agent, who allegedly told 
them that the money came from Colombian drug trafficking. Silberman's trial is 
scheduled to begin April 10. 
</P>
<P>
An FBI report released Feb. 16, the day Silberman was reported missing, alleges 
that the former top aide to Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. confessed to the 
money-laundering scheme. Silberman was not in court Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old Silberman abruptly vanished Feb. 15 from San Diego and was 
found unconscious two days later in a Las Vegas hotel room. After leaving a 
suicide note, he tried to kill himself with an overdose of sleeping pills, his 
wife, San Diego County Supervisor Susan Golding, said at a press conference 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after being released Feb. 19 from a Las Vegas hospital, Silberman 
checked himself into the Langley Porter Psychiatric Institute, a UC San 
Francisco hospital known nationally for its treatment. Hospital officials 
maintain that state law bars them from providing information about his 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 20, federal prosecutors claimed that Silberman's trip to Las Vegas 
suggested he was a flight risk, and they asked U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence 
Irving, who has been presiding over the case, to revoke Silberman's $500,000 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
In the same legal papers, they asked Irving to order Silberman to see a 
psychiatrist. That request was made two days before Golding disclosed her 
husband's whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
Irving remains on the case, but Nielsen was appointed to run matters while 
Irving undergoes surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder Jr., the lead prosecutor in the case, 
told Nielsen on Tuesday that there are many factors indicating Silberman is 
likely to abruptly leave San Diego again, this time to escape trial. 
</P>
<P>
Among those, he said, is the abruptness of the Las Vegas trip, Golding's 
apparent lack of knowledge about it beforehand and the circumstances of 
Silberman's discovery. 
</P>
<P>
Gorder also disclosed a new detail at the hearing. Before he left, Silberman 
wrote and left for Golding several letters at their La Jolla house, including 
one to Werner Wenger, whom Gorder called a "mysterious figure in this case." 
</P>
<P>
Wenger, a Swiss attorney and longtime Silberman business associate, had signing 
authority on an account -- the Hong Kong bank account of a Panamanian company 
-- that prosecutors have alleged was essential to the money-laundering scheme. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Silberman asked Wenger to "take care" of his estate as well as 
various accounts and fees, Gorder said. Golding did not turn that letter over 
to police, Gorder said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorder did not elaborate on the letter or its significance and declined to 
comment about it after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney James J. Brosnahan, meanwhile, said there is "nothing about 
the circumstances of the trip" that suggests Silberman is likely to flee. 
Silberman had been allowed to travel freely in the United States, Brosnahan 
said, and used his own name to buy his airline tickets to Las Vegas and to 
register at the Las Vegas Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
Without explanation, Nielsen restricted Silberman's travel to California. He 
also ordered that Silberman report by phone to court authorities every Monday, 
Wednesday and Friday after his release from the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
As for the request to force Silberman to see a psychiatrist, Nielsen said that 
is not necessary since Silberman is already under medical care at Langley 
Porter. The judge did order Victor I. Reus, the doctor in charge of Silberman's 
treatment, to provide a report detailing his training and background. 
</P>
<P>
Reus, reached at his San Francisco office Tuesday, declined to comment on 
Silberman's condition or treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Brosnahan said after the hearing that Silberman's treatment includes "taking it 
easy" and "a lot" of family visits. Brosnahan said he can't tell yet whether 
Silberman will be ready for the scheduled April 10 trial date. 
</P>
<P>
Nielsen also said he wants prosecutors and defense attorneys to report back to 
him Thursday with suggestions about a gag order. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Nielsen said he was "shocked" when he heard Brosnahan had told 
reporters in Las Vegas that Silberman was worried that he could not get a fair 
trial before Irving. 
</P>
<P>
In Las Vegas, Brosnahan also said that Silberman's concern, as well as his 
disappearance, were prompted by Irving's comment that statements Silberman 
allegedly made to FBI agents upon arrest were "self-incriminating."

CHURCH FACES BIG BILL TO ERASE VANDALISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANKI V. RANSOM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three sides of an Encinitas church remain defaced with red paint, and an 
employee of a company that had been retained to do work at the church has been 
arrested in connection with the vandalism, a sheriff's investigator said. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Floyd Feese said William Damery, 19, of Spring Valley was arrested 
Thursday after a footprint found in the paint was determined to match his. 
Damery was booked into the County Jail in Vista on suspicion of felony 
vandalism exceeding $5,000. He was released on bail that night, Feese said. 
</P>
<P>
About 7:30 p.m. Feb. 17, Gus Pappas, president of the parish council, 
discovered the paint on the outside walls and on the concrete path around the 
incompleted St. Constantine and Helen Greek Orthodox Church. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a shock," said the Rev. Theodore Phillips. "It brought us much sadness 
to see something beautiful defaced, to see the house of God desecrated." 
</P>
<P>
Repairs will probably begin next week at a cost of $25,000, and, because the 
paint cannot be washed off, the stucco has to be reapplied, Pappas said. 
</P>
<P>
Feese said he did not know whether the vandalism was an act of revenge or a 
crime of hate. 
</P>
<P>
There was a dispute concerning the amount of money the church agreed to pay the 
company for which Damery worked, Feese said. Feese said that W. E. Walters, a 
Lemon Grove painting contractor, estimated that it would take three to five 
days to apply water sealant to the church, and that church leaders agreed to 
pay $13,000. But, because the job took only a day and a half, the church 
council wanted to pay only $11,000. 
</P>
<P>
However, Pappas called it a "typical contract dispute" that was resolved. He 
declined to comment further. He said he only mentioned the disagreement to the 
detective because he asked. 
</P>
<P>
"It came up because I knew that whoever did the vandalizing had to be someone 
who knew about paint and who had access to paint," Pappas said. 
</P>
<P>
Feese said that whoever vandalized the church used a power-sprayer during a 
heavy rainfall between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. Feb. 17, when visibility was minimal. 
</P>
<P>
Situated just east of Interstate 5 on Manchester Avenue, the church's golden 
dome displays an unplanned image of a shining cross to passing motorists. 
</P>
<P>
Physicists have been asked to study the appearance, Pappas said, adding that 
they suspect it is caused by the sunlight reflecting off the curvature of the 
dome.

VAN DE KAMP ATTACKS WILSON ON SEWAGE COMPLIANCE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Democratic gubernatorial candidate John Van de Kamp attacked Republican U.S. 
Sen. Pete Wilson on his home turf Tuesday over the question of water quality in 
the ocean off San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp charged that, when Wilson was mayor of San Diego a dozen years ago, 
he "sought to evade the secondary sewage treatment requirements of the federal 
Clean Water Act." 
</P>
<P>
On the third day of his official tour of California to announce his candidacy 
for governor, Van de Kamp charged that Wilson has cost San Diego residents 
"millions of dollars" by his failure to comply with the act and therefore 
qualify for federal cleanup funds. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Van de Kamp said, the city no longer qualifies for the money that 
would have paid for the secondary treatment of sewage dumped into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day, enough partially treated sewage to fill Jack Murphy Stadium is 
flushed into the waters off San Diego," Van de Kamp said as he stood looking 
out over San Diego Bay. "Over the past seven years, there have been nearly 
2,000 spills of raw sewage. 
</P>
<P>
"When that happens, beaches are closed. Fish and birds and swimmers are exposed 
to disease. An important piece of the California dream is degraded. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are disgusting moments, but they are not rare in California. And they 
throw into sharp contrast the choices that confront the voters in 1990." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the Van de Kamp charges Tuesday, Wilson spokesman Otto Bos said: 
"Pete Wilson went back to Washington and argued with the EPA that, based on a 
number of opinions by scientists, it is a waste of money to spend money on 
secondary treatment for sewage. It also rings hollow for Van de Kamp to come to 
San Diego and criticize Pete on this coastal issue when Van de Kamp refused to 
join Pete and many Democrats in opposing the drilling of oil in the Pacific 
Palisades" in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
In other remarks Tuesday, Van de Kamp once again challenged Wilson, the 
presumptive Republican gubernatorial nominee, to support the so-called Big 
Green environmental initiative Van de Kamp hopes to qualify for the November 
ballot. The initiative would be one of the most sweeping environmental measures 
ever passed in the country and, among other things, would end the dumping of 
improperly treated sewage in California. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone in this race for governor goes to the beaches after the sewers 
overflow or the oil spills hit and promises to protect the environment," Van de 
Kamp said. "But where were they before disaster struck? Were they there to make 
the hard choices that would have kept this filth off the beaches?"

UCSD FOUNDER REVELLE IN CRITICAL CONDITION AFTER HEART SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By YOLANDA RODRIGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UC San Diego founder Roger Revelle was listed in critical but stable condition 
Tuesday after undergoing triple-bypass surgery and aortic valve replacement at 
UCSD Medical Center, a hospital spokeswoman said. The surgery was performed 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Revelle was "not feeling very well" when he was admitted Thursday for 
monitoring and testing, said Leslie Franz, a hospital spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Revelle, who will be 81 on March 7, had a pacemaker implanted last year, Franz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The bypass and valve surgery were performed by Dr. Stuart W. Jamieson, who 
joined the UCSD medical staff in July, 1989, from the University of Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
Franz said that Revelle's wife, Ellen, has been "spending a lot of time with 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Revelle's research in geology, oceanography and atmospherics has brought him 
global reknown. He laid the groundwork for the theory of plate tectonics and 
was one of the first scientists to recognize the danger posed to the atmosphere 
by the burning of fossil fuels. 
</P>
<P>
For his research on the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, Revelle 
won the Balzan Prize in oceanography and climatology in October, 1986. The 
little known but prestigious prize -- a medal and $165,000 cash -- is awarded 
yearly in fields not represented by the Nobel Prize by the International Balzan 
Foundation of Milan, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
While serving as director of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Revelle 
envisioned a university dedicated to scientific research. That institution, 
sitting on 50 acres of public land donated by the city of San Diego and next to 
the Scripps Institution, was dedicated in November, 1960, as the University of 
California, San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Revelle served as director of the Scripps Institution from 1950 to 1964 and 
then as head of Harvard University's Center for Population Studies until June, 
1975. 
</P>
<P>
Revelle is now a professor of science and public policy at UCSD, a position he 
has held since 1975.

MURDER DEFENSE POINTS FINGER AT TWO OTHERS; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: DAVID SCOTT HARRISON'S ATTORNEY SAYS IN OPENING STATEMENT THAT SLAIN 
WOMAN'S HUSBAND, FATHER BOTH ARE MORE SUSPECT THAN HIS CLIENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The defense attorney for accused murderer David Scott Harrison argued in his 
opening statement Tuesday that there are more likely suspects in the 1988 
killing of Harrison's ex-wife, including the victim's husband at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"It is true David Harrison was unhappy" with victim Anne Jenkins because of a 
battle with her over visitation rights of their two children, attorney Alan May 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Turning his gaze from Superior Court Judge David B. Moon Jr., who is hearing 
the trial without a jury, to the victim's husband, who was sitting in the first 
row of the courtroom, May added: 
</P>
<P>
"But evidence will show that Gary Jenkins had motive, opportunity and the means 
to kill his wife. . . . Gary Jenkins was the last person to see her alive, 
supposedly, and the first person to see her body, supposedly." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, May argued, there was blood on the telephone used by Jenkins when 
he discovered his wife's body and called 911, even though Jenkins testified 
during Harrison's preliminary hearing that he didn't touch his wife's body. 
</P>
<P>
May added that Anne Jenkins' father, Harry Wanket, can also be considered more 
of a suspect than Harrison. May cited the testimony of a witness to the county 
grand jury that he had overheard Anne Jenkins telling a man in front of her San 
Marcos home minutes before she was killed, "We don't need your money anymore." 
</P>
<P>
That remark, May argued, was apparently intended for Wanket, who had employed 
his daughter at his construction company. She quit the job four days before she 
was killed on Feb. 17, 1988, a month after she and Jenkins won $727,000 in the 
state lottery. 
</P>
<P>
If Harrison were still angry with his former wife over their protracted custody 
battle, May said, he could have simply abducted the two children during the 
three days he had them in his custody the weekend before her death. 
</P>
<P>
Given that there was no forcible entry into Anne Jenkins' home the day of the 
killing, and given that Harrison "is the last person she'd let in the house, it 
must have been someone she trusted," May said, again looking toward where 
Wanket and Jenkins were sitting. 
</P>
<P>
May contended that the prosecution of Harrison was like "trying to fit a square 
peg into a round hole." No evidence puts Harrison at the scene, May said; 
rather, "you'll hear plenty (of testimony) poisoning your mind about why they 
want him there," he told the judge. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Larry Burns alleged that Harrison carefully planned the killing by, 
among other things, studying a virtual "catalogue of murder methods" in various 
books he owned describing how to commit "the perfect murder." 
</P>
<P>
The lack of forensic evidence linking Harrison to the scene is consistent with 
the very books he was reading, Burns said. Anne Jenkins' murder was the final 
act against Harrison's ex-wife and was preceded by a three-year harassment 
campaign he directed at the Jenkinses and Wanket because he was bitter that 
Anne Jenkins' new husband and father were helping her finance her court battles 
against him, according to the prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses will testify, Burns said, that Harrison spoke angrily toward Anne 
Jenkins -- even more so after she and her new husband won the lottery. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecution witness Todd Neumann testified Tuesday that, during a 10-month 
relationship he had with Harrison, Harrison remarked to him, "It would have 
been cheaper to kill (her) than to divorce her."

DEFENSE FIRM WHISTLE-BLOWER WINS $859,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former business manager at General Dynamics has won an award of $859,000 
after a jury decided he was wrongly fired for raising allegations that the 
company had improper billing procedures and allowed extensive cost overruns. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego County Superior Court jury Tuesday granted $500,000 in punitive 
damages to Randall J. Holmes, which follow $359,000 in compensatory damages 
awarded Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes, 52, was fired in 1984, just days after he said he alerted company 
supervisors that he had spotted improper billings and overruns as part of his 
work as a business manager assigned to the controller's office of the giant 
defense contractor. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel this sends a clear message to those people working in the defense 
industry," Holmes said Tuesday night. "If defense workers see any mismanagement 
or fraud or waste, they should pick up the phones and use the hot lines to call 
Washington." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Isabel, a General Dynamics spokesman, said the company will appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"The verdict comes as a surprise to us," he said. "Our counsel feels there was 
a total lack of evidence to support the case. And we intend to follow counsel's 
recommendation to appeal the decision." 
</P>
<P>
After a two-month trial, the jury determined that Holmes, who spent 13 years 
with General Dynamics in San Diego, was fired in direct retaliation for raising 
allegations that the company was violating the federal False Statements Act. 
</P>
<P>
He alleged that there were improper billing procedures on two aircraft 
projects, and that cost overruns that should have been borne by General 
Dynamics were hidden when the company converted those costs into new projects 
dealing with the Phalanx cruise missile, the F-16 aircraft and the M-1 tank. 
</P>
<P>
Those overruns, he alleged, amounted to about $10 million -- money he and his 
lawyer said the government later absorbed. 
</P>
<P>
"They converted a General Dynamics problem into a government problem," said the 
lawyer, Michael Thorsnes. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes, in explaining how he identified the overruns and other problems, said: 
"I have a background in data systems. When you're doing work like that, you're 
trained to find problems and track them down. And all of the thrust of my 
background was in that area. 
</P>
<P>
"So, when you're looking at columns of figures, you can spot things like this." 
</P>
<P>
Thorsnes said that, before his client was fired, Holmes had built an exemplary 
work record that included achievement awards, numerous commendations and 
several other honors. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Holmes had had a distinguished and unblemished career," Thorsnes said. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes said he now works in the health care industry. His wife, Judith, had 
also worked for General Dynamics, but she was fired in 1983. The jury found 
that she too was dismissed "without good cause." 
</P>
<P>
Thorsnes said that, although no criminal charges have been filed in the case, 
he hopes the verdicts will prompt a federal investigation into Holmes' 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the jury's action," he said, "an investigation may and should 
proceed."

<P>
Separate investigations will be conducted by the San Diego city school district 
and by San Diego police into circumstances surrounding the extensive police 
response to a student demonstration at Gompers Secondary School on Friday, 
Supt. Tom Payzant said Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
During a school board meeting, Payzant and school trustees said they are 
bothered that the presence of more than 30 police units may have fanned the 
demonstration into a larger incident than it otherwise would have been. Despite 
the police response and the walkout by 200 students, there were no injuries, 
which Payzant and board President Kay Davis termed a matter of luck. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was in support of Rhoenna Armster, a controversial teacher 
who was involuntarily transferred last week to Lincoln High School under an 
administrative personnel procedure invoked by the Gompers principal. Payzant 
said Tuesday that he and the board back the transfer, but cannot comment on the 
for it because of state law and possible litigation. 
</P>
<P>
Payzant said the district will also look into allegations that Armster and 
other Gompers teachers -- who have been at odds with Principal Marie Thornton 
-- actively encouraged the students to walk out of class and will discipline 
them if they violated school district rules.

Once again deferring its looming fiscal 1991 budget crisis, the San Diego City 
Council on Tuesday took no action on a package of tax and fee increases it had 
planned to place before voters on the June 5 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the council scheduled a special budget meeting for March 7 -- just two 
days before it must forward any ballot proposals to the county registrar of 
voters for placement on the June ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The 1991 fiscal year begins July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Next week's meeting will be the third special session and fourth council 
discussion in a month devoted to filling the $59.9-million gap between the 
proposed $492.5-million fiscal 1991 budget and the $432.6 million that will be 
available in the city treasury. 
</P>
<P>
A vote scheduled for Tuesday was delayed to review an eleventh-hour proposal by 
Councilman Ron Roberts that calls for the council to immediately enact $41 
million in tax and fee increases, including a 2% utility users tax for 
residents and a 5% utility tax on business and industry. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts also wants to put a $20-million property tax increase on the ballot and 
cut $6 million from the proposed budget, largely in arts and promotional 
programs. His plan would make public safety the city's top spending priority. 
</P>
<P>
The council is also scheduled to decide whether to place four other 
revenue-generating measures and a Gann spending limit waiver on the ballot.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CHULA VISTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 21-year-old construction worker was shot three times when two groups of 
students from separate Chula Vista high schools met in a park Monday night to 
finish an argument started in a Tijuana bar, said a Chula Vista police 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel J. Ballesteros of Chula Vista was with one group of high school 
students, Officer Carol Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
He was treated for superficial wounds on his face, chest and abdomen, and 
released from Kaiser Permanente Hospital, spokesman Jim McBride said. 
</P>
<P>
Torres said Ballesteros was shot by Jesus Renteria, 19, a student at 
Southwestern College in Chula Vista who had brought a shotgun and fired four 
shots, hitting the victim in the chest, face, and left eye. Renteria was 
arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and is being held in 
County Jail downtown on $10,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
The altercation in Tijuana between two minors began over the weekend and 
continued across the border, where a fight broke out at a Jack in the Box 
restaurant in San Ysidro, Torres said, adding that San Diego police were 
called, but that no one was injured or arrested. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-agers decided to settle the dispute Monday at Greg Rogers Park on 
Oleander Avenue, where students and adults carrying clubs and steel bars met at 
8:17 p.m., Torres said.

VOTERS SUPPORT LIMITED INCREASE IN SCHOOL TAXES FOR SANTA CLARITA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new survey indicates that Santa Clarita Valley voters support increasing 
property taxes to pay for building schools, but education officials say the 
amount of the tax would raise less than a 10th of the money needed to provide 
classrooms for the swell of students anticipated in the area over the next 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The San Ramon-based firm of Price Research Consultants, which conducted the 
telephone poll in January, concluded that area voters support issuing $24 
million in bonds, which would require raising the average homeowner's property 
taxes about $60 a year. 
</P>
<P>
But the five Santa Clarita Valley school districts that paid for the poll need 
a total of $400 million for new schools over the next 20 years, said Clyde 
Smyth, superintendent of the William S. Hart Union High School District. A bond 
issue of that size would add more than $300 annually to property tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
College of the Canyons in Valencia, a community college that is also 
experiencing rapid enrollment growth, helped pay for the $8,000 survey. 
</P>
<P>
The poll of 600 randomly selected Santa Clarita Valley registered voters found 
that $50 to $60 per year was probably the maximum amount by which two-thirds of 
them could be persuaded to raise their property taxes. Bond measures must be 
approved by a two-thirds margin. 
</P>
<P>
The survey found that voters with children are willing to raise their taxes by 
$72 per year, while non-parents are willing to increase taxes by only $48 per 
year. But the survey also found that an aggressive advertising campaign 
explaining the school districts' needs could persuade two-thirds of the voters 
to support the $60 tax. 
</P>
<P>
The poll first asked respondents whether they would vote to raise their 
property taxes by various amounts, beginning with $22 annually and going up by 
various increments to $96. The questioners then provided the respondents with 
an explanation of the issue that was written with the intent of eliciting 
support for a bond measure to pay for school construction. After that, the 
pollsters again asked how much they would be willing to raise their property 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Funding for new school facilities is one of the most pressing issues facing the 
area's five school districts, which face a continuing flood of new students 
drawn by the area's supply of new housing. The capacity of the state's system 
for financing school construction is far exceeded by the need for new schools, 
and much of the fund-raising burden falls on local school districts. 
</P>
<P>
The five Santa Clarita school districts commissioned the poll to gauge how much 
money they could reasonably expect to raise from a local bond measure that 
would have to be approved by voters. The Hart, Sulphur Springs, Castaic, 
Newhall and Saugus school districts and College of the Canyons paid for the 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
"It has become clear that the state isn't going to come charging in on a white 
horse down I-5 and drop off money for new schools at our exit," said Scott 
Brown, superintendent of the Castaic Union School District. 
</P>
<P>
"The trustees in our valley said, 'Let's find out what people perceive to be 
the needs, and what they are willing to do to meet those needs,' " Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Education officials in the area say that their school facilities are stretched 
to the limit. For example, Sierra Vista Junior High in Canyon Country, designed 
for a maximum of 1,100 students, will have at least 1,365 students next year. 
Several other campuses consist entirely of temporary buildings and trailers. 
</P>
<P>
College of the Canyons, with about 5,700 students, is the state's 
fastest-growing community college with an enrollment that is expected to jump 
127% during the next eight years. "Our classrooms are bulging," college 
President Dianne Van Hook said. "We cannot offer the number of sections to meet 
the demand because we have no place to put them." 
</P>
<P>
School officials said they were disappointed, but not surprised, that local 
voters say they will not support a higher level of new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the opposition to paying new taxes, local voters may have a second 
reason to resist paying for bonds for new schools, said Pat Saletore, 
chairwoman of the Santa Clarita Parents' Lobby. 
</P>
<P>
"People are afraid if they pay for more schools, more development will occur," 
Saletore said. 
</P>
<P>
Education officials said they will use the survey results to decide whether to 
pursue a bond measure in the next general election. 
</P>
<P>
Smyth said a $24-million bond measure could raise voters' expectations that the 
money raised would alleviate school crowding. But it would be far less than 
what would be needed and could alienate the public when schools remain crowded, 
Smyth said. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the poll, Smyth said, the districts may decide to delay asking 
voters to raise taxes until they are confident of winning passage of a bond 
measure sufficient to meet the districts' construction needs. Each district 
will decide independently whether to float a bond measure. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we will put it off a year and use that period of time to educate the 
public as to what is the need, and then we can come back and give it a run," 
Smyth said.

FIRM FINED FOR TOXIC-WASTE BURNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A cement plant near Gorman, which is under review by state health authorities 
because it burns hazardous waste, has agreed to pay a $5,000 fine for burning 
illegal fuel last fall, Kern County air quality officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The penalty settlement between National Cement Co.'s Los Robles plant and the 
Kern County Air Pollution Control District was half the amount originally asked 
by air pollution officials, and far less than the maximum $43,000 that could 
have been assessed. 
</P>
<P>
The company was accused of burning a petroleum-based material known as carbon 
black during a 42-day period last September and October. The company has 
permits to burn hazardous wastes as fuel in its cement-making process, but 
carbon black was not one of its permitted fuels. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the state Department of Health Services said tests showed the 
material apparently did not pose a health hazard to neighbors. But the 
spokesman added that the department is still evaluating broader health concerns 
about the plant's emissions from hazardous waste incineration.

L.A. COUNCIL'S ETHICS BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For our council members to suggest that, if given the same salary as Superior 
Court judges, they will be ethical is patently ludicrous. The requirements in 
education and experience to become a judge go far beyond those needed to become 
a council member. 
</P>
<P>
So what it boils down to is "if you pay us enough we will follow our own code 
of ethics!" Should we raise the salaries of all city employees who will also 
adhere to the same code? 
</P>
<P>
To have to pay elected officials extra to maintain a standard of ethics 
includes the implication that if they do not get the money, they won't be 
ethical. 
</P>
<P>
I find I am not alone in decrying the sleazy tactic of tying the raise to the 
ethics code, and submitting it to the voters as a "take it or leave it package" 
when the council knows full well that, if separated, the pay raise would be 
resoundingly defeated. This subterfuge in itself shows a complete lack of 
ethics on the part of the council members who voted for it. We should be 
thoroughly ashamed of them.

L.A. COUNCIL'S ETHICS BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reading the article (Feb. 14) about the decision of the majority of the 
members of the Los Angeles City Council to include a pay increase of $32,822 in 
the so-called ethics bill, I realized that there are at least four members of 
the council, Gloria Molina, Joy Picus, Joan Milke Flores and Marvin Braude, who 
seem to understand that the voters are not stupid enough to be taken in by such 
a blatant act of arrogance. 
</P>
<P>
Molina was correct in stating that joining the ethics bill with the pay 
increase tells voters that "I will be honest if you pay me enough," because 
that is exactly what this bill is telling us. 
</P>
<P>
The taxpayers are supposed to reward the council members for doing what they 
were elected to do -- represent their constituents with honesty and integrity. 
</P>
<P>
Frankly, I can't think of anything special that the council has done to warrant 
a raise, let alone a $32,822 raise. The air is still too polluted, the beaches 
are being ruined, the crime rate keeps increasing, too many people are still 
sleeping on the streets. And if the cost of housing continues to increase there 
will be many more people living on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
I hope that come June the voters will send the 10 council members who approved 
the measure a loud and clear message and vote no on it by an overwhelming 
majority.

NOW FOR A SALVADORAN MIRACLE; 
</P>
<P>
 THE NICARAGUAN UPSET SHOWS THE POWER OF A SECRET BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The election defeat of the Sandinistas was almost as big a stunner in El 
Salvador as it was in Nicaragua. Now the Cristiani government and the leftist 
rebels -- and the Bush Administration -- have a great opportunity to reopen 
stalled peace talks and end that bloody civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Some leaders in San Salvador and Washington may be tempted to view the 
electoral rout of the Sandinistas as the precursor of a battlefield rout of 
their ideological kin, the Salvadoran rebels of the Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front. But that's simplistic and probably wishful thinking. Sure, 
the Sandinistas gave aid and comfort to the FMLN, but that aid was never all 
that pivotal. In terms of battlefield tactics and, even more important, popular 
support inside El Salvador, the FMLN repeatedly proves itself quite capable -- 
even against a 50,000-man army backed up by $1.4 million a day in U.S. aid. 
</P>
<P>
Not only are the FMLN rebels tough, but the Salvadoran army's performance still 
leaves a lot to be desired. Despite 10 years of scolding and prodding by U.S. 
advisers -- many of whom learned painful lessons about guerrilla war in Vietnam 
-- the Salvadoran generals still insist on pursuing small, mobile rebel bands 
with large army units -- and only in the daytime. Worse, Salvadoran military 
leaders still have not won the hearts and minds of their own people. The murder 
of six Jesuit priests by an elite army unit did not help to win a whole lot of 
public support. 
</P>
<P>
So the defeat of the FMLN's allies in Managua doesn't mean the Salvadoran 
government should launch a renewed frenzy of war. That would resolve nothing 
and prolong the bloodshed. The lesson to learn from Nicaragua is that a 
peaceful political fight can be more devastating to Marxists than 
anti-guerrilla warfare. Consider the Chamorro political miracle: It was only 
when the Nicaraguans took their political differences to the polling booth that 
a white-haired grandmother accomplished what the Contra rebels and the CIA 
failed to do: beat the Sandinistas. The Salvadoran government may be able to 
the same thing, but we won't know until it draws the FMLN into the political 
process, too. That won't happen at the point of a gun, but it just might at the 
conference table.

L.A. COUNCIL'S ETHICS BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Michael Woo's Feb. 13 Op-Ed piece ("Can't Live With Money -- or Without") he 
makes a statement we agree with: "Money is the root of the problem." Since Woo 
represents Hollywood where we have lived for more than 30 years, we were 
interested in his views on ethics. 
</P>
<P>
Our "ethical" council member wrote a letter on behalf of one of his campaign 
contributors to the city zoning administrators asking for "every consideration" 
in support of this developer's application for a waiver and a variance for 
commercial use in our residential neighborhood. Woo's "helpfulness" enabled his 
campaign contributor to cut down a 100-year-old avocado tree and other trees 
abutting a historic and architecturally unique area which has lent its charm to 
scores of Hollywood films and TV productions. Our association now has to retain 
expensive counsel to try to undo what Woo did. 
</P>
<P>
It's ironic that a few years ago we were forced to hire a high-priced lobbyist 
to gain access to Woo to stop another obnoxious intrusion into our 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Woo may run for mayor. His scheme for public financing would finance his 
ambitions.

Woo has got it right; his proposal to limit campaign contributions will do much 
to correct the scandalous conditions arising out of campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
My only complaint is that the provisions of his measure could be more 
stringent. And it ought to be, at least, a statewide initiative. 
</P>
<P>
The voter, not special interests, should be calling the tune. It follows that 
the voter should pay the piper.

AN AMBASSADOR-CLASS SCHOOL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ambassador Hotel has been through monumental changes in its 69 years. Now 
the defunct hotel is the focus of a bidding war involving preservationists, 
Donald Trump and the Los Angeles Unified School District. But in going all out 
to "win" the Ambassador property, the school district has mistakenly taken a 
righteous line and lost sight of achieving the basic educational goal. 
</P>
<P>
School officials want the Ambassador's 24-acre site on Wilshire Boulevard for a 
high school. But while there's no doubt about the need for another mid-city 
high school, the Ambassador site is the wrong place for it. 
</P>
<P>
A company managed by Trump owns the Ambassador property and recently announced 
tentative plans to develop a 125-story office tower. Whether such a skyscraper 
ever will, or should, be built is still open to question. But there's little 
question that the mid-Wilshire district would be stabilized by a development 
consistent with its commercial surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
The staff of the agency that controls the school construction purse strings, 
the State Allocation Board, has recommended that the board turn down the 
district's request for $120 million to buy the prime real estate. Even if 
voters in June approve $500 million in school-construction funds, the board 
would find it hard to set aside 20% of the entire amount for one Los Angeles 
school. 
</P>
<P>
So why not pursue some of the district's creative proposals that are more in 
keeping with budgetary reality? Like turning inner-city parks into school 
sites, and allowing the grounds to be used as parks on weekends and after 
school. The Department of Recreation and Parks should stop fighting this. And 
it is important to find sites that don't require large-scale demolition of 
existing housing -- something else in desperately short supply in the mid-city 
area. Los Angeles High School sits on a compact 11 acres, including an athletic 
field. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it isn't fair that many suburban schools built 20 to 30 years ago 
are roomier. Just as it isn't fair that Proposition 13 forced many school 
districts to stop building schools and thus precipitated the current crisis. 
But the sad reality is that the district must stretch every school construction 
dollar as far as it will go. Paying $120 million for one school along a pricey 
commercial strip won't take those dollars far enough.

<TEXT>
<P>
The pilgrimage is over. The long march of the West's "progressive" 
intellectuals has come to a bedraggled end in Nicaragua, a peasant nation about 
as far, socially, as a nation can be from the conditions where the revolt 
against modernity was supposed to take root. 
</P>
<P>
Marxism has been just that revolt for those who look upon it sympathetically 
(usually from a safe distance, in modern "bourgeois societies"). The revolt -- 
romanticism in drag, dressed up as science -- was against the supposed cold 
rationality and soulless banality of a capitalist, industrial, commercial 
world. 
</P>
<P>
The revolt was supposed to succeed first where the Industrial Revolution came 
first, in Europe, probably in Germany, with its large proletariat. But the 
supposed engine of history, the industrial workers of the world, would have 
none of it, preferring material progress and freedom, and understanding the 
connection of the two. 
</P>
<P>
So intellectuals in fatigues (Castro, Ortega) foisted Marxism on peasants who 
were perceived as "unspoiled" by the "false consciousness" of capitalism. But 
given a chance, the peasants say, "Please, spoil us." 
</P>
<P>
To the non-Marxist left, including many church groups, the charm of the 
Sandinista regime was its anti-Americanism. How galling for those people that 
the regime has been toppled by a candidate known in Nicaragua to be backed by 
the United States. Where now can the glazed gaze of the last political pilgrims 
turn? To North Korea? Meanwhile, so high have been the stakes of American 
politics, and so mistaken have been the stances of one faction, that in victory 
we have a surfeit of what normally accompanies defeat -- recriminations. 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of the Soviet system under the pressure of Western military 
preparedness has elicited, from those who fought that preparedness, the 
preposterous thought that the collapse proves that the preparedness was 
disproportionate to the task. Now the alibi industry on the left, which did not 
quite kill aid to the Contras soon enough to save the Sandinistas, must deal 
with this truth: Without Ronald Reagan, there would have been no Contras to put 
pressure on the regime, pressure that eventually led to elections. 
</P>
<P>
The ongoing attempt to make Reagan a figure of fun, an attempt now entering its 
second quarter-century, founders on a huge fact: The world is going his way, in 
no small measure because it was his way. From Eastern Europe to Central 
America, "the evil empire" has collapsed because Moscow lost its nerve and 
capacities. 
</P>
<P>
The reputations of many people and the interpretations of many events are 
undergoing revision. The U.S. effort in Vietnam looks more worthwhile in light 
of the subsequent blood baths and waves of boat people. They discredit those 
who, in their zeal to see America defeated, professed to see humanitarianism on 
the other side. 
</P>
<P>
One can now see why the overthrow of Allende's incipient Leninism in Chile, 
coming just as Vietnam was being conquered, was such an unnerving event in 
Moscow and throughout the international left. It shattered the myth of 
inevitability. The leftward ratchet of history was broken: All movement in that 
direction was not irreversible. 
</P>
<P>
Another crack in the left's confidence (confidence was everything, material 
accomplishments being paltry) came when communism crested short of power in 
post-Salazar Portugal. Can it be just 15 years since "Eurocommunism" was "the 
wave of the future"? 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of people who a year ago were suffering under communism's 
cruel stupidities are today suffering even more. They are Chinese -- and, lest 
we forget, Tibetans, who are under China's grinding heel. We know that all the 
nations of the world are now porous to news. (Turn up those American 
transmitters!) Our friends -- if such they still are -- in China, the 
democratic forces, knew what happened in Nicaragua as soon as it happened. Now 
is the time for the Bush Administration to acknowledge the futility of its 
gentle policy toward China and turn up the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
The change of regimes is cause for joy in two communities in Miami. Many 
Nicaraguans can now go home. And the Cuban Americans, for whom America is home 
and Cuba is an imprisoned family member, know that Castro is next. Moscow 
should be told that all cooperation with the United States is now contingent on 
the ending of all aid to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
One of the creations of "progressive" political pilgrims was the pro-Castro 
Fair Play for Cuba Committee (which attracted Lee Harvey Oswald). Now, this 
instant, we need a fair-play-for-Cubans policy.

CRIME: OFFICIALS INTENSIFY THEIR CAMPAIGN TO CLOSE A MOTEL WHERE THEY SAY 
PROSTITUTES AND DRUG DEALERS PLY THEIR TRADES.

CUDAHY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It sits along Atlantic Boulevard in an area where police say prostitutes ply 
their trade for anything from $40 to three cans of beer and a $15 IOU. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlantis Motel consists of two stories of dirt-encrusted, broken-down rooms 
that stink of frying grease. Most of the tenants have lived there for months, 
sometimes years, signing over their welfare checks to the manager to cover the 
$150 average weekly rental. 
</P>
<P>
Many are on drugs, police say. Nearly all have small children who play in the 
parking lot and are sometimes spotted bathing in the swimming pool, which reeks 
of urine and too much chlorine. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlantis has been around Cudahy for 25 years, and every year, according to 
residents, business people and city officials, it becomes a bigger sore spot on 
a busy street lined with some of the town's most established businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Business people say they can't remember a time when the Atlantis was a decent 
low-budget motel. 
</P>
<P>
"Our customers can't even walk down the street without being propositioned or 
asked if they want to buy drugs," said one businessman. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlantis, Jack Joseph, the acting city manager said, is "a blot on the 
city." 
</P>
<P>
Over the last few months the city, with help from the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department, has launched a feverish campaign to wipe the Atlantis 
Motel from Cudahy's streets. 
</P>
<P>
Officials have tramped through the security gates innumerable times in the last 
few months to conduct building inspections, fire inspections and Health 
Department inspections. Cudahy's building inspector, Daniel Pulone, said 
inspectors from his office visit the Atlantis about twice a week, noting the 
code violations. 
</P>
<P>
With long lists of violations supplied by the county Department of Health 
Services and county Fire Department, the city is building an arsenal of 
evidence it plans to use when it sues the owner in an effort to have the motel 
declared a public nuisance and closed. 
</P>
<P>
The city recently changed the curb marking in front of the motel from a 
temporary no-parking zone to a no-parking zone in an administrative attempt to 
stop drive-up drug transactions and prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
If the paper-work onslaught fails to shut or clean up the Atlantis, city 
officials say they hope law enforcement will succeed. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies have spent 263.3 hours in two months responding to calls at 
the Atlantis Motel, Lt. Dennis Dahlman said. Dahlman said 36 arrests for 
prostitution have been made, as well as an unknown number of arrests for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a major problem," Dahlman said. "But we are not going to give up by any 
stretch of the imagination. We're going to keep pounding on them and pursue 
every avenue to get it closed down." 
</P>
<P>
Shutting the Atlantis Motel for good may not be easy, city officials said. 
Although the motel has a long history of violations, inspectors said, 
violations are corrected within the deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a frustrating experience for city officials, who insist that the 
motel is nothing more than a haven for drug dealers, vandals and prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
Room 106 of the Atlantis Motel is the room inspector Pulone says is least 
likely to win a Good Housekeeping award. 
</P>
<P>
The door has been broken off its hinges and rests precariously against the 
frame. Inside, a double bed with a stained mattress dominates the room. There 
is trash everywhere -- on the floor, piled on the kitchen table, crammed into 
cracks of ripped furniture. The curtains are tattered and faded green. The 
carpet is brown. Everything is covered with grime. 
</P>
<P>
This is the room from which deputies say many of the drug sales occur. 
</P>
<P>
Upstairs, in cramped Room 209, 19-year-old Becky Sanchez tries to clean up 
after her two infant children. She lives in the $190-a-week room with her 
uncle, a friend and her children. She wants to get out, she said, but has to 
stay home with her children and can't save any money for a deposit on an 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Almost everyone blames the condition of the motel on manager James Wu and owner 
Jau Huang. 
</P>
<P>
"The manager doesn't care about us," tenant Sandra Shaw said, plopping down on 
the bed. 
</P>
<P>
Although Huang has owned the motel since May, 1988, inspector Pulone says Huang 
has made no effort to clean it up and, in fact, has let it become more squalid. 
</P>
<P>
Pulone said Huang told him he bought the place sight unseen for $1.5 million. 
Huang's name is on a business card describing him as vice chairman of Radisson 
Plaza Hotel South Bay, scheduled to open in July in Carson. 
</P>
<P>
According to building permits, Huang is vice president of Wei-Chuan 
Construction, the Monterey Park company building the Radisson Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Huang, who lives in San Marino, is now in Taiwan, Wu said. Representatives from 
Wei-Chuan construction refused to comment on the condition of the Atlantis 
Motel, saying it is Huang's private business. Wei-Chuan Construction pays the 
motel's water bills, according to city records. 
</P>
<P>
Wu blamed the motel's problems on the tenants. 
</P>
<P>
"We paint in the afternoon, they writing by the next morning," Wu said. "Who 
can handle? I cannot handle." 
</P>
<P>
Wu, who had a pile of eviction notices on his desk, said he has tried to evict 
unruly tenants, but said: "They don't want to leave." 
</P>
<P>
Pulone is not sympathetic. If Wu can't get rid of unruly tenants, somebody else 
should, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You know who I really feel sorry for?" he said. "The kids. All those poor 
little kids."

FINES FOR LITTERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A recent letter recited the fact that many persons who act in anguish when 
there is an oil spill that affects our environment are the same ones who throw 
litter from their autos and leave garbage on our beaches. 
</P>
<P>
The sea has a way of tossing the litter back, thus penalizing mankind with, at 
times, expensive cleanups. 
</P>
<P>
Our public authorities should move in the same direction: assessing heavy fines 
for even the most moderate acts of littering -- whether the acts occur on land 
or sea. The penalties should be widely publicized and the cost of the program 
derived from fines assessed the violators.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
A SOMETIMES EXPENSIVE SHERIFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To his credit, Sheriff Brad Gates has gone the extra mile to combat the problem 
of drugs. But on another score, he's proving to be something of an 
embarrassment for Orange County, and running up quite a bill in the process. 
</P>
<P>
The county recently hoisted a white flag by agreeing to shell out $475,000 to 
settle out of court with a local private investigator and his lawyers; they 
contended that the sheriff harassed critics and improperly handed out gun 
permits to cronies. The award to Preston Guillory is the second time in four 
years that the county has agreed to pay big money in cases involving 
allegations that Gates used his department to investigate political rivals. In 
1987, the county had to pay $375,000 to former Orange County Municipal Judge 
Bobby D. Youngblood, a former candidate for sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
Taken together, these settlements paint a disturbing portrait of how business 
sometimes is done with the county sheriff, and what can happen if you cross 
him. He denies all of it. But if there weren't merit to the lawsuits, it's 
highly unlikely that the county would have to go to its deep pockets. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the agreement bars evidence that Guillory gathered from being disclosed 
until after March 9, the filing deadline for candidates for sheriff. Gates is 
running unopposed for reelection so far, but that section of the agreement 
leaves a lot to the imagination. Guillory has said Gates gave out almost 200 
gun permits to friends, and that many others went to people who were not 
qualified. 
</P>
<P>
These are troubling allegations, but another way to look at the settlement is 
to think in terms of cost to the taxpayer. In effect, the county is in the same 
position as any government entity that insures itself and then has to pay off 
claimants for the recklessness of one of its employees. Add these settlements 
to his salary and Gates sometimes seems an expensive sheriff.

AZTECS' BEST HAS SURVIVED HIS SEASON ON THE BLINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER

<DATELINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The plane carrying the San Diego State basketball team was descending on 
Albuquerque, N.M. Michael Best was stretched out in his seat, staring blankly 
out the window. He was holding a Sony Walkman in his hands, and it was pumping 
music into his head. 
</P>
<P>
Best will listen to almost anything. His preference is rap, jazz and reggae. 
</P>
<P>
"I like music, period," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A long time ago, he played the drums. When he was seven, Best and three friends 
formed a band. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom used to get mad when she'd try to go to sleep," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The band never performed publicly. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to, but we never really got deep into it," Best said. "People 
started moving away . . . " 
</P>
<P>
He had a cousin who was about 10 years older, and he also played the drums. 
Best learned to play by watching his cousin. 
</P>
<P>
"Picked it up by watching," Best said. "Played by ear." 
</P>
<P>
The fledgling musicians also played basketball. 
</P>
<P>
The subject had come up in the lobby of an Albuquerque hotel. Best was 
recalling his younger days, days when anything seemed possible and basketball 
was a joy. 
</P>
<P>
"We played basketball all of the time," Best said. "We played in snow, rain, 
darkness . . . we just played. That's how it is on the East Coast. If you're 
serious about what you want to do, you stick with it." 
</P>
<P>
And so he has. 
</P>
<P>
But the moments Michael Best best remembers this season did not happen on a 
basketball court. They involve a coach, an old lady and a buddy from his 
hometown. And that should pretty much tell you how Best's senior season at SDSU 
has gone. 
</P>
<P>
He was supposed to be one of the cornerstones of a young Aztec team this 
season. He was the lone returning starter from a 12-17 team, a team on which he 
was the second-leading scorer (12.5 points a game) and the leader in assists 
(113) and steals (61). 
</P>
<P>
But those numbers were buried by something else: after 26 games last season, 
Best was suspended for the season when he turned up dirty in a college 
administered drug test. 
</P>
<P>
That's where SDSU Coach Jim Brandenburg comes in. Brandenburg allowed him to 
return this season, and Best continues to appreciate it. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the main thing right there," Best said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Brandenburg: "I felt if he could right the wrong, he deserved a chance to 
prove himself." 
</P>
<P>
At 7:30 tonight against Hawaii, Best will play his final game in the San Diego 
Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
It won't be what you would call a triumphant exit. 
</P>
<P>
His field goal percentage this season is 36%. Over the past nine WAC games, 
Best a guard, has made just a little under three of every 10 shots he has 
attempted (27%). And during a 70-55 loss at Texas-El Paso last week, he had 
nine turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been frustrating, but I'm not going to let it get to me," Best said. "If 
you do, you start getting gray hairs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to hang in there. I know that a lot of people are expecting more out 
of me, but I can't go out there and force it like Michael Jordan." 
</P>
<P>
The UTEP game was particularly frustrating. He looked like the Michael Best of 
old in the first half, dishing off for seven assists. But he had a rough second 
half -- no assists, and by the end of things, finished with more turnovers than 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
Then, he ran into the old lady. He had never seen her before, and he will 
probably never see her again. He didn't get her name, but he will remember her. 
She was standing outside the Special Events Center at UTEP after the game and 
caught Best's attention as he was walking to the team vans. 
</P>
<P>
"Hi Michael Best," she said. "I enjoyed watching you tonight." 
</P>
<P>
It was a simple sentence. But when you're in the depths of disappointment and 
confusion, sometimes simplicity is what stands out the most. 
</P>
<P>
"It really shocked me," Best said. "I didn't have a good game. I said 'Thank 
you.' That was a big memory for me. I'm not going to forget something like 
that. She was rooting for UTEP. And I didn't see anything I did that was 
spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
"If you know basketball, you know who can play. Someone can have zero points 
and do other things to stand out." 
</P>
<P>
In the past nine WAC games, Best has averaged 4.7 points a game. In those 
games, he has taken more than 10 shots just three times. The Jan. 18 New Mexico 
game, when Best made 10 of 13 shots and ended up with 24 points -- is a distant 
memory. Lately, Best has quit looking for the shot. He is content to pass. When 
the season started, Brandenburg hoped for some leadership and scoring punch 
from Best. What he has gotten is a little bit of leadership and some rebounds 
-- Best is third on the team at four a game. 
</P>
<P>
"He really does have an instinct for the game very few players have," 
Brandenburg said. "The scoring hasn't been there, but one thing he has done is 
rebound for us. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say he probably took the heat as far as the best defensive players in the 
WAC. They started playing him much closer, not giving him much room to shoot. 
He knew what we needed to be successful, and he started to try to give us 
scoring punch to the detriment of his own stats. He won't say it, but I think 
there is a confidence factor." 
</P>
<P>
Brandenburg is right. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I've lost confidence," Best said. "If I'm off and I keep 
shooting, I ain't doing nothing for the team. If somebody is at 48% to 60% 
inside shooting, they have a better chance than me. I just try to make the best 
play for the team. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't been a great year for me -- I'm not scoring big numbers, but I've 
done other things. I've created things on the court and played hard during 
(crunch) time. I've gotten the ball to people who can score. I can't do 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
The season started going downhill for Best even before it had begun. He 
underwent surgery to remove pins from his left knee just weeks before practice 
opened Oct. 15. Since then, his statistics have been down and his weight has 
been up. By the time he was ready to play, he weighed 235 pounds -- from a 
normal 215, according to Best. The SDSU media guide lists him at 6-feet-4 and 
200 pounds. He has lost some weight, but not much. He said he is at 228. 
</P>
<P>
The pins were left over from knee surgery when he was at Clemson, before he 
transferred to SDSU in 1987. His knee ached, and finally he decided to have the 
pins removed. 
</P>
<P>
It was supposed to be a simple procedure. It turned out that the doctor had to 
scrape away some of the bone that had grown over the pins -- more of an ordeal 
than expected. 
</P>
<P>
That meant more time sitting around before he could work out. The starch and 
grease from the school cafeteria collected, and soon there was more of Best 
than there was last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think obviously the weight is a problem," Brandenburg said. "I've not been 
pleased with the weight he has maintained. I'd like to see him 10 or 15 pounds 
lighter, but that's easier said than done." 
</P>
<P>
Already a few weeks behind his teammates in workouts, Best hasn't been able to 
catch up. His shooting fell off. His turnovers increased. Eventually, he was 
taken out of the starting lineup. He sprained an ankle and missed SDSU's 
victory at Air Force Jan. 13, and he hasn't returned to the starting lineup on 
a regular basis since. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll come off the bench," Best said. "It doesn't bother me. I'm not mad about 
not starting. That's how life is." 
</P>
<P>
Best began to learn some of life's lessons several years ago on the streets of 
Washington, D.C. When he played against Colorado State 10 days ago, he had a 
chance to talk about those days with Ram guard Jamie Hines, an old friend. The 
two hadn't seen each other in a several years, and they talked about the old 
days -- and about how much had changed. 
</P>
<P>
Best was in his hometown of Seat Pleasant, Md., for three weeks last summer, 
and he didn't like what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't look the same," he said. "Everybody there wants to do their own 
thing. They're shooting each other over drugs. Before I left (from Clemson to 
SDSU), they were telling me they were not going to get into it. I said I'd be 
back soon. I came back there and they couldn't even look me in the eye and tell 
me what they were taking. They were walking around like zombies. They had me 
scared, and they were like my best friends." 
</P>
<P>
This was a couple of months after a few marijuana cigarettes left his own 
future in jeopardy. One of Best's cousins died last February. Before that, one 
of Best's uncles died. "I've been through so many problems in school, I was 
stressing sometimes," Best said. "There's been a lot of death in my family. But 
it was a stupid mistake on my part, and I regret it." 
</P>
<P>
Not that Best's life was trouble-free before that. He is 24, two years older 
than most college seniors. One reason is because he redshirted a season. The 
other is that he had to repeat fifth grade after he was expelled from school 
for throwing a snowball with a rock in it and hitting a girl in the eye. He was 
expelled again in seventh grade for poor attendance. 
</P>
<P>
A few memories like these, and 36% from the field doesn't seem so bad. He is 
still hoping to earn an NBA tryout. If that fails, he said he will try to hook 
on with a team in Italy. But for now, he is playing college basketball. And 
despite some lower-than-expected numbers, that in itself is quite an 
accomplishment for Michael Best. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I'm so proud," he said. "It's a big turnaround. I was the baddest 
thing on the streets."

ZUNGUL PONDERS RETIREMENT; 
</P>
<P>
KEYWORD: AT 35, 'THE LORD OF ALL INDOORS,' IS FRUSTRATED WITH HIS COACH AND HIS 
ROLE WITH THE SOCKERS.

Is Steve Zungul thinking of calling it a career before the end of this rocky 
season? 
</P>
<P>
"Might happen, it might not happen," Zungul said Tuesday. "I don't know yet." 
</P>
<P>
Zungul, the 35-year old Socker forward known as "The Lord of All Indoors," said 
he is frustrated with his present situation. He said he made the decision not 
to travel for tonight's game against the Dallas Sidekicks for reasons other 
than his arthritic hips. 
</P>
<P>
"I have arthritis, and it's going to stay with me the rest of my life," he 
said. "But nothing has changed. I can play. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not in the regular shifts. Why should I go on the road if I'm not going to 
play? For two minutes? To jump on the field when we're down? I'm not going all 
the way just for that. It's very hard to sacrifice yourself for a coach who 
doesn't wish you any good." 
</P>
<P>
Socker Coach Ron Newman said Zungul told Bill Taylor, the team's trainer, that 
his hips were bothering him, and that he wouldn't be able to travel. Newman 
also said Zungul is not fit for full shifts. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to sort of keep getting him in (the game) in bits and pieces to get him 
in shape so he can hold down a full-time spot," Newman said. "But he's 
certainly not capable of holding down a full-time spot yet." 
</P>
<P>
Zungul played significantly in Friday's 8-1 loss to Baltimore and a few shifts 
in Saturday's 6-1 loss to St. Louis. Yet, according to Newman, Zungul was 
unable to keep up with his teammates in certain drills during Monday's 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought surely if he can only play bits of two games and then he can't go 
again, isn't something trying to tell him that it's time to hang them up?" 
Newman said. "If he was five years younger, I could sure use him." 
</P>
<P>
Zungul thinks he could help the team if he could do things his way. 
</P>
<P>
"I can be in shape in one week," he said. "I'm already in pretty good shape. I 
think I can do things, but I have to have my own power. I cannot be the 10th 
player or the 15th player. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot be quiet about things that I see going wrong. I can listen to 
opinions from Kevin (Crow) and Quinny (Brian Quinn), but those guys can't tell 
me how to play the game. All of them, they're my students. I know they're big 
guys now, they're grown people. But life is life and they're still young in 
that department." 
</P>
<P>
If Zungul were to retire, the Sockers would have several options. One 
possibility, a trade, could happen either way. Socker President Ron Cady said 
Tuesday the Sockers are still negotiating but nothing has been solidified. 
</P>
<P>
Another possibility would be to bring a player up from the reserve team. Newman 
even said he would consider Juli Veee, the popular Socker forward who retired 
at the conclusion of the 1988 season. 
</P>
<P>
"If suddenly Steve said he were going to retire, I think I'd have to take a 
look at Juli," Newman said. "If Juli was serious, I'd have to get him in 
training for a week and see how fit he was."

DOW UP AGAIN; INVESTORS GAIN IN CONFIDENCE

<P>
Stock prices chalked up additional gains Tuesday amid improved investor 
confidence due to the market's strong performance in the aftermath of a rout in 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, which jumped 38.29 points on Monday, 
added another 14.64 to close at 2,617.12. 
</P>
<P>
In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered declining ones, with 927 
up, 558 down and 496 unchanged in New York Stock Exchange trading. Big Board 
volume rose to 152.59 million shares, up slightly from Monday's 148.91 million. 
</P>
<P>
Spirits on Wall Street had gotten a lift from the market's ability on Monday to 
cope calmly with Tokyo's troubles. Confidence was bolstered again Tuesday as 
the market managed to maintain its upward momentum. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo's partial recovery Tuesday also reassured U.S. investors. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Nikkei 225-share index fell 1,569.10 points, second only to the 
3,836.48-point plunge on Oct. 20, 1987. On Tuesday, the Nikkei recovered 576.08 
points to close at 33,897.95. 
</P>
<P>
Hildegarde Zagorski, a market analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said 
stocks were ripe for a rebound, having been sold heavily before this week. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what we're seeing here is a technical rebound," she said, noting that 
investors still are nervous about the consequences that sluggish economic 
growth could have on corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
Investors, meanwhile, were reluctant to read too much significance into a 
tumble in orders to U.S. factories for durable goods. Stocks barely budged in 
response to the government report, market watchers said. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods fell a record 10.5% in 
January, compared to economists' prior estimates of a 3.4% decline. It was the 
biggest decline since orders first were tracked 32 years ago. The decline was 
largely caused by a drop in orders for aircraft, cars and other transportation 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
American Express led the Big Board's list of actively traded stocks, slumping 
5/8 to 28 1/8 as more than 3.4 million shares changed hands. The selloff came 
after news that American Express will pump an additional $750 million into its 
Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings unit after making a $250-million infusion in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
Pfizer regained 3 1/8 to 59 1/8 after running up losses Monday as a 
Congressional subcommittee began hearings on defective heart valves formerly 
manufactured by the company's Shiley unit. Securities analysts noted that the 
panel didn't recommend a criminal investigation into Shiley. 
</P>
<P>
Among the active blue chips, International Business Machines lost 1/4 to 103 
3/4, General Motors moved ahead by 1/2 to 45, American Telephone &amp; 
Telegraph added 1/2 to 39 5/8, General Electric was up 3/4 at 62 and Philip 
Morris fell 1/8 to 37 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
AMR, parent of American Airlines, gained altitude due to a favorable assessment 
by a Wall Street analyst. It rose 1 to 59 1/2. Among other airline stocks, UAL, 
owner of United, jumped 2 to 128 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Several retail stocks had a strong day. Wal-Mart, which reported a 32% surge in 
fourth-quarter income, jumped 1 3/8 to 43 1/4. Woolworth, which posted a 22% 
pickup in its fourth-quarter profit, rose 3/4 to 59 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
Shares on London's Stock Exchange finished a confident session slightly higher, 
calmed by relative stability in overseas equity markets. At London's close, the 
Financial Times 100-share index was 5.5 points higher at 2,254.8.

Momentum Pushes Bond Prices Higher 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices rose, boosted by momentum from gains a day earlier, a continued 
strong dollar and the weak durable goods report. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond jumped 1/2 point, or $5 for every 
$1,000 in face value. Its yield, which declines when the bond's price rises, 
tumbled to 8.44% from 8.48% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the bond market's optimistic mood of Monday persisted as the 
stock market chalked up additional gains and the dollar continued to advance 
against the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
A strong dollar tends to bolster dollar-denominated securities such as Treasury 
bonds and notes.

The stock gains bolstered the sentiment that U.S. interest rates could ease in 
the near future. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, analysts said, bond prices got a lift from the plunge in durable 
goods orders. The data, suggesting economic weakness, reinforced expectations 
that domestic interest rates could decline. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.25%, unchanged from late Monday.

CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Again Hits High Against Yen 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose against the Japanese yen, reaching an eight-month high despite 
intervention by central banks, while closing mixed against other currencies. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Palladino, a trader with Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank in New York, said the 
Federal Reserve sold dollars in New York in an attempt to drive down the 
currency's value against the yen when the dollar reached the 148.80 to 148.85 
yen level. 
</P>
<P>
He said the intervention appeared to have little effect. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Bank of Japan tried to stem the dollar's rise against the yen in 
the Tokyo market. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose Tuesday to 148.73 yen in late trading in New York. The dollar 
has not closed that high against the yen since June 15, when it reached 151.30 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said U.S. currency softened a bit in the morning after the Commerce 
Department released the durable goods report. But the dollar soon regained its 
strength, Palladino said. 
</P>
<P>
"It really was a nothing trading day," said Bob Morrissey, a trader for Bank of 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 149.03 yen from 148.65 yen at Monday's 
close. Later, in London, it slipped to 148.57 yen. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar was mixed against the British pound. In London, the pound traded at 
$1.6915 late Tuesday, cheaper than $1.6927 late Monday. In New York, the pound 
cost $1.6908, more than the $1.6903 of late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices fell. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid for gold at 
$408.25 an ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down 25 cents from late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery dropped 70 cents an 
ounce to $408. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, gold traded in London at a late bid price of $407.25 an ounce, down 
from $411.75 bid late Monday. In Zurich, the bid price was $411.25, unchanged 
from late Monday. In Hong Kong, gold fell $4.30 to close at a bid $407.85. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Gasoline Prices Fall on Bearish Signals 
</P>
<P>
Gasoline futures prices were pummeled on the New York Mercantile Exchange in a 
selloff linked to perceptions of ample near-term supplies and strongly bearish 
chart signals. 
</P>
<P>
Other petroleum futures also retreated. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, silver futures led the precious metals lower; pork 
bellies were down the daily limit; cattle futures advanced, and grains and 
soybeans were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Unleaded gasoline futures settled 0.80 cent to 2.27 cents lower, with the 
contract for delivery in March down 2.27 cents at 57.56 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
West Texas Intermediate crude oil finished 18 to 41 cents lower, with April at 
$21.58 a barrel; heating oil was 0.06 to 0.89 cent lower, with March at 58.16 
cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Energy futures were weak for much of the session amid perceptions of ample 
supplies of gasoline along the Gulf Coast and in the New York harbor, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Further selling stemmed from expectations the American Petroleum Institute 
would show a substantial increase in U.S. inventories of gasoline for the 
seventh week in a row, and from position-evening ahead of the expiration 
Wednesday of the March petroleum contracts. 
</P>
<P>
But the heaviest selling occurred late in the session after the March gasoline 
contract dropped below 59 cents a gallon, triggering waves of sell orders based 
purely on chart signals. 
</P>
<P>
"When it got pushed down to the point where the technicals kicked in, then it 
was just a blood bath," said Jerry Samuels, an analyst with Shearson Lehman 
Hutton Inc. in New York.

CARNIVAL '90 AT PALLADIUM EVOKES THE SPIRIT OF RIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It wasn't exactly Rio, but it wasn't bad. The Brazil Carnival '90 Mardi Gras 
celebration at the Palladium had much of the ambiance, the color and the fun of 
Tuesday's season-changing festival in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
The evening succeeded, in large measure, for two reasons: the first American 
performance of an electrifying Brazilian singer named Baby Consuelo, and the 
sheer enthusiasm of a crowd that seemed determined to live it up -- no matter 
what. 
</P>
<P>
Consuelo has everything it takes to become a major international singing star. 
Slender and attractive, she was a virtual caldron of energy, moving restlessly 
across the stage with the fire and fury of a Latin Janis Joplin. 
</P>
<P>
Consuelo's singing, always strikingly rhythmic, always right on the mark, had 
the kind of uplifting charge characteristic of Al Jarreau's finest efforts. And 
her work with the band -- which was led by the guitar-playing husband of her 
six children -- sizzled with the musical interactivity of a U2. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from Consuelo's sparkling singing, however, the music moved in fits and 
starts throughout a lengthy, erratic program. The Embrasamba All-Stars and Viva 
Brazil provided solid, if unspectacular rhythms for the dancing crowd. But the 
subtle beauty of samba singer Joao Nogueira's music was largely defeated by the 
clatter and blur of the sound system. 
</P>
<P>
In the final analysis, it was the audience who provided the evening's most 
celebratory moments, especially during a vibrant costume contest. Once the 
predictable Playboy bunnies, French maids and Mickey Mice were passed, the 
finalists' outfits -- shimmering with sequins, beads, feathers and huge 
headdresses -- gave Carnival '90 its closest connection with the magic and 
fantasy of Brazil's original festival.DON HECKMAN

FOUNTAIN MAKES U.S. DEBUT AT AMBASSADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA PERLMUTTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ian Fountain had a right to seem a little shy and a little gangly, a mere 
20-year-old striding onto the stage at Ambassador Auditorium on Monday night. 
This was, after all, his U.S. debut. 
</P>
<P>
But winners of prestigious competitions -- in this case, the 1989 Artur 
Rubinstein International Piano Competition in Tel Aviv -- are already seasoned 
by harrowing rounds of outperforming their rivals. The bloom of youth often 
leaves their cheeks before its time. 
</P>
<P>
Not so this lanky, fresh-faced Briton, who still looks like a chorister at New 
College, Oxford. 
</P>
<P>
Rest assured, however, that his playing is that of a virtuoso. And by evening's 
end -- after a temperature-raising account of Chopin's A-flat Polonaise (an 
encore) -- came the unmistakable flush of triumph. 
</P>
<P>
Nor was there anything tentative throughout the oddly put-together program that 
included Schubert. Whether laying out four Scarlatti sonatas immaculately, or 
imparting full flourish to Liszt's B-minor Ballade, Fountain put himself 
completely to the task. 
</P>
<P>
One could hardly blame him for wanting to show off his champion's wares -- for 
one, a Horowitzian ability to strike bunches of keys at high velocity and still 
sound each note with singular clarity. The Ballade, and Chopin's B-minor Sonata 
provided such opportunities, as well as a gauge of his youthful directness and 
exuberance. 
</P>
<P>
To Schubert's B-major Sonata he brought the music's life force, its gentleness 
and the soul of a skipping child, without yet grasping the Andante's seraphic 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the pianist seemed content to display his startling technical gifts. 
But Fountain leaves the hint of another sensibility, one to lure listeners to a 
return visit.DONNA PERLMUTTER

STERN GIVES RECITAL IN PHILHARMONIC'S CELEBRITY SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY McQUILKIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Isaac Stern, virtually everyone will agree, has for the last half-century 
practiced insightful, refined music-making at its most elegant. He continues, 
at 69, to demonstrate superior control, keen insight and impeccable taste. 
</P>
<P>
But it would be fair to regard him more as a masterful stylist than as an 
impassioned romantic. The first half of his recital Monday at the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion certainly bore that out. 
</P>
<P>
The evening opened with an tasteful, pleasant but almost cool account of Bach's 
Sonata inE minor, BWV 1023. Aided by the unobtrusive pianism of Robert McDonald 
, the violinist made soothing but essentially earthbound music. 
</P>
<P>
The pair turned next to the romantic rhetoric of Faure's First Sonata, where 
their handsome shaping of phrases and movements made an attractive reading. 
Stern's playing, nonetheless, proved surprisingly subdued, his tone sweet but 
unassertive, his emotional involvement open to question. 
</P>
<P>
But following intermission, Janacek's complex, mercurial, utterly personal 
Sonata fully ignited the violinist. Bringing potent vitality to the opening Con 
Moto, soaring lyricism to the Ballada and a wealth of colors to every movement, 
Stern offered an account both technically sure and emotionally expressive. He 
and McDonald infused the four-movement composition with unrelenting urgency and 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
It was in the poignantly shaped Finale that the felicity of the partnership 
proved most tellingly in evidence; not only were violinist and pianist 
rhythmically secure and dynamically balanced, but they unceasingly exhibited 
absolute interpretive agreement, to stunning effect. 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, a series of short works completed the program, but Stern chose 
examples a grade above the usual chestnut status. The violinist brought clean 
technique and an easy manner to two Kreisler works and grace and vitality to a 
pair of Dvorak "Slavonic Dances," as arranged by Kreisler. TERRY McQUILKIN

But the White House quickly dismissed the report. "We are not aware of the

Israel and Poland resumed full diplomatic relations after a 23-year break. 
</P>
<P>
Poland became the third Warsaw Pact country to renew relations with the Jewish 
state in the last six months. Warsaw severed relations during the 1967 Middle 
East War. Hungary restored relations in September, and Czechoslovakia followed 
suit Feb. 9. Poland has had low-level ties with Israel since 1987, and the new 
Solidarity-led government is hoping that the restoration of a formal embassy 
will lead to closer economic and cultural cooperation.

WOO CLAIMS SUPPORT FOR PARING DOWN PAY RAISES; 
</P>
<P>
CITY COUNCIL: HE SAYS HE HAS AT LEAST EIGHT VOTES TO REDUCE THE PROPOSED SALARY 
INCREASE AND MAKE IT MORE ACCEPTABLE TO VOTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A majority of Los Angeles City Council members have indicated that they will 
vote to reduce the $32,822 pay raise they are requesting as part of a city 
ethics reform package, Councilman Michael Woo said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Woo plans to introduce a motion today asking council members to cut their 
pay-raise request by $8,188, a move intended to make the entire ethics package 
more palatable to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
The pay-raise request, to be placed on the June ballot, will be tied to 
proposals for public financing of political campaigns, a ban on outside work 
and honorariums for elected officials, and restrictions on gifts they may 
receive. Voters must approve a pay raise if they want to adopt the reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The pay raise was not part of the original ethics-reform package proposed by 
Woo and a citizen's commission in January. Instead, a pay-raise request was 
inserted into the package last month by the council and increased two weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Backers and opponents say the fate of the entire reform package may hinge on 
the public's willingness to approve a raise for council members, who now are 
paid $61,522 a year. Council members are the highest paid in the country, 
according to a Times survey. 
</P>
<P>
Woo, who has been shepherding the reforms through the council, said Tuesday 
that he has lined up at least eight votes for scaling the new salary back to 
$86,156 -- a 40% raise and the annual salary of Municipal Court judges. Council 
members decided two weeks ago to ask the voters for a $32,822 pay raise -- 53% 
-- that would bring their annual salaries to the level of Superior Court 
judges, who now get $94,344. Woo has since been lobbying his colleagues in an 
attempt to persuade eight of the 15 council members to go along with a smaller 
request. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've got at least eight (votes). That's all we need," Woo said 
Tuesday. "There are some members who would like a larger raise, but on the 
other hand, you have to consider what would be easier to get the voters to 
support. 
</P>
<P>
"I think indexing salaries to Municipal Court salaries is easier to sell (to 
the voters) than Superior Court salaries." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city's salary commission recommended that council salaries be 
raised to the level of Municipal Court judges and future raises be tied to that 
level. 
</P>
<P>
The council was to have completed the ballot measure Tuesday, but because of a 
last-minute flood of amendments the matter was put off until today -- the 
deadline for getting the measure on the June ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the amendments are technical changes, but a number, including Woo's 
pay-raise motion, could alter the package significantly. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, a vocal opponent of some elements of the reform, 
said she will renew a request that the proposed ban on outside work be 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still concerned about the discrimination between earned income and 
unearned income," Galanter said. 
</P>
<P>
As the proposal now stands, elected officials may not be paid in return for 
outside work but still could receive income on investments, the councilwoman 
noted. "The only outside income that's banned is earned income," she said. "You 
can spend all day on the phone manipulating your stock portfolio and making 
outside income and there's no problem. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"But if you want to get it the old-fashioned way, it's considered, on the face 
of it, a conflict of interest." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ernani Bernardi, who opposes public financing of political 
campaigns, said he intends to seek a change in ballot language that will make 
clear to the voters that public money would be used for campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi also will make another attempt to have the major elements of the 
package split into separate ballot measures to give the voters greater choice. 
</P>
<P>
An amendment offered by Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky will seek to reduce the 
pension benefits of anyone who does not accept the pay raise, if it is approved 
by the voters. 
</P>
<P>
The measure apparently is aimed at Mayor Tom Bradley, who has vowed to turn his 
raise over to charity.

PAIR TERRORIZE FAMILY OF SIX; PREGNANT WOMAN SLAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police on Tuesday sought two robbers who broke into a Huntington Park 
condominium and terrorized six members of a family for hours before killing a 
pregnant woman and her 8-month fetus. 
</P>
<P>
The assailants also slashed the dead woman's mother with a knife before 
fleeing, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been here 15 years and I can't think of anything that comes close to this 
one," Huntington Park Police Detective Tom Weselis said. 
</P>
<P>
The family's ordeal began at about 8 p.m. Monday when two men in their late 
teens sneaked past a security gate and burst into a mud-brown condo on Oak 
Street behind Huntington Park High School, Weselis said. 
</P>
<P>
According to police and neighbors, the home belongs to Jose and Guadalupe 
Licea, their son, Juan, 26; their pregnant daughter, Silvia Enriquez, 24; her 
husband, Alfredo Enriquez, and the couple's 22-month-old son. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly three hours, the two intruders -- one armed with a handgun and the 
other brandishing a knife -- demanded money and repeatedly threatened to kill 
or maim members of the family, Weselis said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the men went upstairs and began ransacking the bedrooms in a search for 
money or valuables, the detective said. The other man ordered Juan Licea to 
blindfold and bind the hands and feet of his father and brother-in-law and to 
tie his mother's hands. 
</P>
<P>
After the younger Licea obeyed, Weselis said, the intruders ordered him to 
place television sets, a videocassette recorder and other valuables by a door 
as they continued rifling the family's belongings. 
</P>
<P>
"The place was totally ransacked; like somebody dropped a bomb inside of it," 
Weselis said. 
</P>
<P>
The man with the gun then tried to haul Silvia Enriquez, eight months' 
pregnant, into a side room. Apparently believing she was about to be killed, 
Weselis said, the woman struggled with her attacker and tried to wrest the gun 
from him. 
</P>
<P>
"The suspect then threw the pregnant woman to the ground and shot her," Weselis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
When Silvia Enriquez's mother, Guadalupe Licea, tried to go to her daughter's 
aid, the man with the knife slashed her across the face and head, Weselis said. 
Juan Licea then lunged at the attackers before escaping and running to a 
neighbor's apartment to call for help. 
</P>
<P>
Two more shots were fired inside the home before the intruders fled, but no one 
else was injured. 
</P>
<P>
"We were watching television when we heard people running and someone 
screaming," said a frightened Rosario Gomez, who lives next door with her 
husband and five children. 
</P>
<P>
"At first we huddled on the floor, hearing the gunshots. Then we called the 
police." 
</P>
<P>
Gomez said Silvia Enriquez was still alive, moaning and crying, when the men 
fled. 
</P>
<P>
But by the time paramedics arrived, the woman was dead of a chest wound, 
Weselis said. Paramedics ran a series of tests and determined that the fetus 
also was dead, the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
Guadalupe Licea was taken to St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood for 
treatment of cuts and released Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Huntington Park posted a $10,000 reward Tuesday for information 
leading to the arrest and conviction of the two assailants. Some neighbors said 
the area around Oak Street has become increasingly dangerous in recent months, 
plagued by gangs and widespread drug dealing. Gang graffiti could be seen 
scrawled on the curbs and sidewalks near the condominium. 
</P>
<P>
But police said they believe the attack was random and motivated by robbery. 
Weselis described the assailants as young black men, about 17 to 19 years old, 
of medium build and average height, dressed in jeans and dark-colored baseball 
caps. 
</P>
<P>
Police were preparing to release composite sketches of the two today. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the two men apparently enetered the home after trailing 
members of the family who had been out shopping and following them past a 
locked iron gate that crosses their driveway. 
</P>
<P>
"Those gates give a false sense of security," Weselis said.

CITY IS OWED BROOKINS REFUND, REPORT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN F. BUNTING and RICH CONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A city report has concluded that Los Angeles is owed about $48,000 in rent paid 
for space in a office complex that was secretly owned by Bishop H. H. Brookins, 
The Times learned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Community Development Department will urge a City Council 
committee today to cancel an $83,000-a-year student assistance program that is 
run out of the Brookins building on Crenshaw Boulevard in Southwest Los 
Angeles, according to City Hall sources, who spoke on condition that they not 
be identified. 
</P>
<P>
The report, which will be submitted today to the council's Community and 
Economic Development Committee, is the product of a three-week 
conflict-of-interest investigation involving Brookins' dual role as a landlord 
who collected rent from the city for his Crenshaw property while he served as 
head of South Los Angeles Development Corp. (SLADC), a 10-year-old poverty 
program located in the building. 
</P>
<P>
Community Development Department General Manager Parker Anderson on Tuesday 
declined to release a copy of the report or comment on it. 
</P>
<P>
But Robert Gay, a deputy to Councilman Gilbert Lindsay, who received a briefing 
on the report from Anderson and other Community Development officials, said, 
"They are going to ask for some kind of repayment by SLADC and Brookins. They 
are taking steps to make sure this does not occur in the future with other 
programs." 
</P>
<P>
Gay said the officials told him that prosecutors dropped a criminal 
investigation of Brookins because a three-year statute of limitations for fraud 
had expired. 
</P>
<P>
Brookins could not be reached for comment Tuesday. His attorney, J. Stanley 
Sanders, did not return telephone calls to his office. In an earlier interview, 
Brookins said he was unaware of any conflict of interest. "If that is the case, 
I will find a way to pay the city back," Brookins said. 
</P>
<P>
The Community Development probe of alleged conflicts of interest is one of 
three by government agencies centering on the publicly financed refurbishment 
of Brookins' office building and the poverty programs housed there. City and 
federal authorities also are looking into a $336,000 federally funded loan 
Brookins used to renovate the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Though Brookins has not been implicated, city officials also are investigating 
allegations of fraud in another city-funded job training program that leased 
Brookins' building for $10,000 per month after the renovation. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported on Feb. 3 that Brookins, a respected leader of the African 
Methodist Episcopal Church and longtime political mentor of Mayor Tom Bradley, 
obtained the federally funded loans through the city to improve the Crenshaw 
facility. Loan documents signed by Brookins indicated that the property was 
owned by a California African Methodist Episcopal Church corporation, but the 
firm never was incorporated in the state, according to the secretary of state's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
The building was later transferred to Brookins and is now worth about $1 
million, records show. City administrators said they never would have financed 
the renovation had they known Brookins owned the building. 
</P>
<P>
Government records show that Bradley and the City Council approved the loan in 
1982 despite being warned by city officials that the subsidy violated city 
funding policies. 
</P>
<P>
Brookins repaid the principal owed on the city loan and the city forgave 
$46,824 in back interest in May, 1988, after the bishop missed the first 15 
monthly payments. Two city administrators told The Times that they were 
pressured by Bradley aide William Elkins to give Brookins favorable treatment 
in negotiating the loan settlement. Elkins has denied intervening on the 
bishop's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
The refurbished building was later transferred to Brookins and leased for 
$10,000 per month to a private firm while the struggling city program run by 
SLADC was moved to a dilapidated office next door. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, SLADC received about $83,000 annually from the city and a 
total of $832,000 since 1981 for job training and education programs, records 
show. About $300,000 of that went into a troubled government jobs program in 
which four people, including two former program employees, were convicted of 
theft in a payroll kickback scheme. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the funds, however, have been allocated since 1983 to a project 
intended to help needy students apply for college admission and financial aid. 
That program also has suffered a series of management problems, ranging from 
inadequate documentation of services and high staff turnover to failure to pay 
taxes, according to Community Development Department reports. 
</P>
<P>
No one answered the telephone at the program's office Tuesday afternoon. But 
the executive director, Ed Dixon, said in a recent interview that he knew 
little about the program's rental agreements or Brookins' ownership of the 
building. He argued that past problems should not doom an important program. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to move forward . . . without the skeletons of old," he said. 
"There is a great need for this program in the community. I believe it is a 
viable program (and) we are doing the things we contracted to do."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITYHOOD BACKERS LOSE BID TO STOP STALLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Malibu cityhood backers made a last-ditch plea to the county Board of 
Supervisors on Tuesday to stop stalling and set a June incorporation election, 
but their request fell on deaf ears. 
</P>
<P>
County officials disclosed Monday that they had appealed a Superior Court order 
that had given them until Tuesday to conclude an incorporation hearing and set 
the election. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the pleas of incorporation proponents, the supervisors -- with the 
exception of Supervisor Ed Edelman -- indicated they would continue to oppose 
cityhood until a sewer system the county wants to build in Malibu is under way. 
</P>
<P>
By a 4-1 vote, the supervisors in November postponed the hearing indefinitely. 
The hearing, required by law so proponents and opponents can express their 
views, is the last step before an election can be set.

FROM FIRE 
</P>

<P>
A 48-year-old man and his 13-year-old autistic son died Monday evening after 
fire swept through their South Los Angeles home, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Jaime Rico and his son, Emilio Jesus Rico, were in the home in the 150 block of 
West 109th Place at 8:30 p.m. when the fire started in a rear bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
Cause of the fire was under investigation but homicide detectives said the boy, 
who was in the bedroom alone, may have accidentally touched it off. 
</P>
<P>
Rico was apparently trying to rescue his son when he was killed, detectives 
said. The two were burned beyond recognition, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A daughter, Griselda Rico, was also in the house at the time of the fire but 
escaped without injury.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL BACKS BOYCOTT OF SALVADORAN COFFEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council unanimously endorsed an international boycott of 
coffee from El Salvador to pressure the government of that Central-American 
nation to negotiate a settlement of its 10-year civil war. 
</P>
<P>
With the 12-0 vote, Los Angeles became the first city in the nation to support 
the boycott and direct municipal departments to stop buying coffee products 
from the strife-torn nation. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Richard Alatorre, who sponsored the measure, said 60% of coffee 
products from El Salvador are sold in the United States. Chicago, San 
Francisco, New York and Boston are expected to be asked to support the boycott.

LA FOLLETTE RETIREMENT IS SETBACK FOR PARENTS GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Fernando Valley parents seeking to break away from the sprawling Los 
Angeles Unified School District said Tuesday they will continue their efforts 
despite an announcement that their most important legislative ally is retiring. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure by Assemblywoman Marian W. La Follette (R-Northridge) that she 
will not seek reelection to her 38th District seat surprised many of the Valley 
parents, who have flooded her office with calls in recent weeks to support her 
latest effort to break up the school district into eight or more smaller 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
"I just spoke with one woman who is just reeling from the news," said Rita 
Morrow, a Northridge parent active in support of the break-up effort. 
</P>
<P>
Although La Follette endorsed an aide to succeed her and said she will continue 
the fight to break up the district after she retires, many of the parents who 
have volunteered their help say they are now without a leader. 
</P>
<P>
"The effort is not going to stop, whoever gets elected," said Barbara Romey, a 
Northridge parent and twice a candidate for the Los Angeles school board. But 
she and others conceded that La Follette's retirement will be a setback. 
</P>
<P>
With only 10 months remaining in office, La Follette will have difficulty 
following through on the breakup plan that most state and Los Angeles school 
officials agree would take three to five years to complete, parents said. 
</P>
<P>
La Follette announced her retirement plans at a news conference Tuesday and 
said she favors Robert Wilcox, 24, an aide in her office since 1986, to succeed 
her. 
</P>
<P>
La Follette has spearheaded several unsuccessful legislative campaigns in past 
years to break up the 708-square-mile Los Angeles school district. Frustrated 
by the lack of interest among her colleagues in the Legislature, La Follette 
this summer launched a plan to have the issue decided by the estimated 1.5 
million registered voters who live within the boundaries of the Los Angeles 
district. 
</P>
<P>
A task force created by La Follette to study the issue held a series of public 
hearings last fall. Sparse attendance, however, indicated that Valley residents 
were not as interested in the assemblywoman's efforts as in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign to break up the 610,000-student district finally caught fire with 
Valley parents after the Los Angeles school board voted Feb. 5 to relieve 
classroom crowding by operating schools on a year-round schedule. 
</P>
<P>
After the board decision, many of the parents who organized opposition to 
year-round schools said a break-up of the district remained the only way to 
free Valley schools from overcrowding and other troubles plaguing schools in 
the rest of the city. The year-round issue also brought to the surface parents' 
concerns about the growing number of inner-city children bused to their 
neighborhood schools. 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox said Tuesday that he will continue to serve as executive director of La 
Follette's task force studying the breakup issue and that the matter "will be 
one of the most important parts of my campaign." 
</P>
<P>
La Follette's task force is expected to release a report next month calling on 
the state Board of Education to take steps toward authorizing an election on 
the breakup issue. 
</P>
<P>
State and local school officials say the breakup plan faces a host of 
obstacles, including legal challenges over the creation of segregated school 
districts, as well as fights over the district's $8.5 billion in property and 
$164 million in unpaid bills.

$3-MILLION DRUG CASE DROPPED AFTER POLICE BOTCH SEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge has ruled that police bungled the search last December of a 
Bell Gardens apartment in which nearly $3 million in cash from drug proceeds 
was discovered. He ordered charges against five defendants in the case dropped. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the case -- which involved officers from the cities of Huntington 
Park and Bell and Bell Gardens -- was seen as a breakthrough in disrupting the 
money-laundering activities of Colombian drug dealers in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
But as a result of the decision issued in Los Angeles on Monday by U.S. 
District Judge Stephen V. Wilson, the confessions of the defendants -- all, 
according to their attorney, admitted drug money launderers -- were suppressed 
and they will not be prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
"The moral of the story," said the attorney for the five, Richard Hamar, "is 
that police officers are becoming so aggressive on the war on drugs that they 
almost feel they have a license to disregard the law. Occasionally, they get 
caught." 
</P>
<P>
Hamar recently moved his practice here from Miami, where he specialized in 
money-laundering cases. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Atty. Stephen G. Wolfe, had a slightly different 
moral. 
</P>
<P>
"When it's fundamentally a contest of credibility between the police and the 
public, it's never a foregone conclusion" who will win, he said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
As for police, Huntington Park Officer Dave Ceja said Tuesday, "We did 
everything the right way," echoing the sentiments of other officers involved in 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
The $2.75 million in small bills, tucked in plastic bags, was found by police 
in closets during a Dec. 14 operation at an apartment on Priory Street in Bell 
Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
After confiscating the cash and money-laundering ledgers from another apartment 
in nearby Downey, a U.S. Customs official declared that the seizure would make 
a major dent in the money-laundering activities of Colombian drug dealers in 
the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
The case was turned over to federal authorities because of significantly 
stronger penalties at the federal level for money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
But on Monday, Wilson ruled that the evidence seized in the case, specifically 
the $2.75 million, would have to be tossed out because the police may have used 
coercion in obtaining approval to search the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is credibility. And the government did not bear its burden," 
attorney Hamar recalled Wilson concluding. 
</P>
<P>
Police from the three cities were part of SEANET, a combined police task force 
that played a major role in last September's seizure of more than 21 tons of 
cocaine in a Sylmar warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
Officers had placed the Bell Gardens apartment under surveillance for about a 
week in December before, police officials testified, they asked a woman living 
in the apartment to sign a search consent form and she complied. At no time 
during the subsequent search did they draw their weapons, officials testified. 
</P>
<P>
But a next-door neighbor, Maria Padilla, saw it differently. 
</P>
<P>
Padilla, who only speaks Spanish, was afraid to talk to Hamar's investigator or 
to Hamar's wife, who is also a lawyer and speaks Spanish, the defense attorney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Wilson took the matter into his own hands by authorizing a deputy U.S. 
marshal to bring the witness to his courtroom. On Monday, Hamar recalled, 
Padilla provided a graphic description of how eight police officers stormed 
into the apartment with guns drawn. 
</P>
<P>
Conflicting officers' testimony on when the consent form was signed also 
contributed to Wilson's decision, the defense lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants, all Colombians, were still being held at the federal 
Metropolitan Detention Center downtown. They are expected to be released soon, 
but they face another hurdle -- immigration officials want to deport them. 
</P>
<P>
They are: Javier Casanas, 32, of South Gate, Bernardo Diaz, 40, of Downey, 
Adolfo Suarez, 28, of Downey, Reynaldo Garcia, 45, of Downey, and Miller 
Ramirez Orozco, 26, of Bell Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Hamar said, his clients want to go back to Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
"They confessed," he said. "They knew what they were doing was wrong. They've 
had it."

DISNEY MAKES PLANS FOR AGGRESSIVE MOVE INTO SOFTWARE MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Buoyed by the success of its first computer game venture last year, Walt Disney 
Co. will jump full scale into the software business later this year, company 
officials revealed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Executives at Disney's year-old software development unit in Burbank said they 
plan to release at least six new game and educational PC titles aimed at 
children by Christmas. The new titles are expected to feature such traditional 
Disney characters as Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, as well as such newcomers as 
Kermit the Frog and Dick Tracy. 
</P>
<P>
Disney is not the first movie studio to exploit the full cash-register 
potential of its cast of characters. PC programs featuring Indiana Jones and 
other movie heroes regularly appear on retail shelves through licensing 
agreements, and even Disney itself has licensed Mickey Mouse and his friends to 
other software publishers over the years. 
</P>
<P>
But now Disney is one of the first studios to take full charge of its 
characters' PC appearances by going into the software business itself and 
de-emphasizing its software licensing activities. The move puts the 
Burbank-based company squarely in the middle of emerging entertainment and 
technology markets, said Roger Hector, director of product development at the 
software unit. 
</P>
<P>
Disney's move into the software market comes as the company is aggressively 
trying to wring as much business as possible from its stable of well-known and 
well-loved children's characters. 
</P>
<P>
However, its move comes as the computer software market has been hit by the 
double whammy of sluggish home computer sales and the still-raging popularity 
of Nintendo-style video game systems. According to industry sources, there are 
about as many PCs in U.S. homes -- about 16 million -- as video game systems. 
</P>
<P>
However, Disney executives profess little concern, noting that the overall game 
and education software markets -- now running at combined annual retail sales 
of about $400 million -- should grow significantly in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in this for the long term and we are very optimistic about the viability 
of the market in that time," Hector said. 
</P>
<P>
The sluggishness of the current market may matter little to Disney products, 
said Gregory Luchsinger, marketing vice president of SoftKat, a Chatsworth 
software distributor. "They have the Disney name and momentum behind them," 
Luchsinger said. "And they have the financial and manpower resources to bring 
out lots of titles, which is exactly what this market demands." 
</P>
<P>
Disney formed its software unit quietly at the end of 1988 and last year 
introduced its first product, a game featuring Roger Rabbit, to cash in on the 
character's enormous popularity and test the PC software market, Hector 
explained. When the Roger Rabbit game sold more than 100,000 units -- making it 
among the top-selling PC games ever -- the company decided to aggressively move 
into the market and has since hired dozens of programmers and other workers. 
Still, the company has made no formal public announcement of its intentions and 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Hector said the new games and educational programs would be aimed at young 
children and would come equipped with on-screen cues that would require no 
special computer skills. 
</P>
<P>
The software development unit is also responsible for developing video game 
projects with outside licensees and writing other software programs such as an 
animation instruction system scheduled for release in two months.

JAPAN INVESTORS TAKE PLUNGE IN STRIDE; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTING: DESPITE THE UNCERTAIN OUTLOOK FOR THE TOKYO STOCK EXCHANGE, MANY 
INDIVIDUALS FEEL THE MARKET WILL REBOUND.

<P>
At Meiko Securities in the Shinbashi district of central Tokyo, a dozen men on 
Tuesday silently watched a bank of 12 television monitors flashing the latest 
stock prices. Others, smoking cigarettes, punched up stock quotes from two 
computers in the lounge. 
</P>
<P>
But Mitsuru Tanaka, a 30-year-old rice dealer, belied the calm atmosphere. 
Seduced by the booming stock prices, Tanaka had decided last year to invest in 
the stock market for the first time because the rate of return was higher than 
the interest on savings accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Tanaka initially invested 3 million yen -- about $20,000 -- in 3,000 shares of 
textile, steel, electronics and trading firms. With earnings from those stocks, 
he invested another 2 million yen later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
As the market plunged in the past week to its lowest levels since 1987, 
however, Tanaka figured he had lost 1 million yen -- a fifth of his investment 
-- and lamented that it was punishment for his greed. "Maybe this is heaven's 
punishment because the money I got is not from hard labor or work," said 
Tanaka, a stout gregarious man. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't even tell my wife. I didn't tell my father. He believes in old values 
and doesn't like this gambling and making a profit out of it. He feels you 
should work hard instead." 
</P>
<P>
These are nervous, uncertain times for Tanaka and more than 21 million other 
individual investors in Japanese stocks. Fears of higher interest rates and a 
weak yen have sent the Nikkei index of 225 stocks tumbling 11% in the past 
week, before recovering slightly on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
It is not yet clear how much individual Japanese investors have suffered in 
real or paper losses. But despite the market's uncertain outlook, many 
investors such as Junko Shibue, a 33-year-old Tokyo homemaker, said they would 
hold on to their stocks because they were optimistic that the market will 
rebound. Many also felt they acted too hastily in selling stocks after the 
market crash of October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I can wait even four or five years because it does not affect our family 
budget," explained Shibue, who began investing in stock three years ago. "I 
only spent our family's spare money for the stocks." 
</P>
<P>
N. Yuasa, a legal assistant at a Tokyo chemical company, shrugged off the 1 
million yen in stock losses that he suffered over the past week. "The stock 
prices were overvalued; maybe they went down as expected. We had this 
educational effect from (1987). Then, we dumped our stocks. Now, we all feel we 
shouldn't move too much. The only people who are dumping stocks are 
institutional investors. Those who have invested their own money have taken a 
wait-and-see attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good exercise for my brain," he smiled. "If I go for a pachinko 
game, it will cost the same amount of money and I won't learn anything." 
</P>
<P>
Individual investors such as Tanaka, Shibue and Yuasa are important customers 
to Japan's brokerage houses, which have lured them into investing by touting 
hefty stock returns of 30% to 40% a year, compared to 7% on bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Although major institutions and companies hold more than 75% of the stocks 
listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, retail sales are still a key segment for 
brokerage houses in Japan. "Retail business to Japanese business is very 
important," explained Yoshiro Katsuya, senior vice president in charge of the 
institutional sales division at Nikko Securities in New York. "Commission 
revenue per share from institutional buyers is less than from retail buyers. . 
. . The volume of actual transactions from institutions is much larger than 
from individuals. However, profitability from the individual investor is much 
larger." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Japanese brokerage business, dominated by Nikko, Nomura, 
Yamaichi and Daiwa, works hard to court individual investors and advertises 
heavily to them. They dispatch female sales representatives to go door-to-door 
to sell stocks to housewives, who control family expenditures and investments. 
</P>
<P>
Widespread publicity about stock trading helped persuade Shibue to invest her 
current 5 million yen in stocks. "Maybe I was influenced by the Japanese media, 
which had repeatedly told us all the good things about stock investment," she 
said. "I concluded myself that at least it is better than bank savings." Her 
stock profits have financed family vacations to Europe and the United States 
and helped to purchase the family car. 
</P>
<P>
Yuriko Kawai, 38, began actively buying stocks two years ago after she took an 
introductory class on the stock market where she met some homemakers who 
invested 50 million to 100 million yen. She transferred nearly all of her 
family savings to stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Those handsome stock earnings helped her and her husband buy a three-bedroom 
apartment 15 miles from downtown Tokyo. "Honestly speaking, it was a shock for 
me," said Kawai of the market decline. "However, after the fall (the market) 
goes up, and after the rise it falls. That's the stock market." 
</P>
<P>
To tap another market of potential customers, brokerages have been dispatching 
sales representatives to visit offices to sell stocks. Masako Ikuta, a 
57-year-old former office worker, put a small amount of money in an electric 
company's stock several years ago and three years ago, at the behest of her 
husband, bought several thousand more shares in Hitachi, Fujitsu and Kirin 
Beer. 
</P>
<P>
But she said she doesn't particularly enjoy playing the stock market and had 
not even checked how much she had lost over the last week. Ikuta said she only 
invested because it had become "some kind of fashion" among her women workers.

DURABLE GOODS ORDERS PLUNGE 10.5%; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: STEEP DROPS IN THE AIRCRAFT AND AUTO SECTORS IN JANUARY GAVE THE KEY 
GAUGE OF INDUSTRIAL GROWTH ITS LARGEST SINGLE-MONTH DECLINE.

<P>
Orders for durable manufactured goods plunged 10.5% in January, the worst 
showing on record, as a post-strike surge in aircraft orders subsided and auto 
production sagged, the government said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Commerce Department's estimate of orders for goods is subject to 
wild swings from month to month, the steep January decline reinforces earlier 
indications of a continuing slump in the nation's manufacturing sector. 
</P>
<P>
"This waves a red flag at what is an ongoing downturn in the industrial sector, 
which has been going on for about 10 months and doesn't seem likely to revive 
any time soon," said Allen Sinai, chief economist with the Boston Co. 
</P>
<P>
"The bright spot is that manufacturing is now a relatively small part of the 
economy, so this doesn't spell recession for the economy as a whole," he said. 
"But we can't go on excusing reports like this with special factors." 
</P>
<P>
If not subsequently revised, the January plunge would be the largest 
single-month decline in durable goods orders since the Commerce Department 
began recording them in 1958. The only month that has come close to January was 
February, 1982, during a recession, when orders fell 9.2%. 
</P>
<P>
Most economists viewed the slump without alarm, however, even though the 
consensus forecast had been that production would decline about 3.5%. Wall 
Street mostly ignored the report, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 
14.64 points for the day. 
</P>
<P>
January's sharp drop in auto production already was common knowledge, and the 
correction from abnormally high aircraft orders after settlement of a Boeing 
Co. strike in November was widely anticipated. Together, the two categories 
contributed to a huge 27.6% decline in new orders for transportation equipment 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress that the sharp 
January drop was surprising, but not alarming, noting that orders for durable 
goods vary greatly from month to month. 
</P>
<P>
"Other data that we have suggest that the order pattern is soft, but by no 
means accumulating on the downside," Greenspan said in testimony before the 
Senate Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the drop "probably indicates a 
slowing in the economy." For the balance of the year, however, "we nevertheless 
expect moderate growth with low inflation," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Giulio Martini, an economist with the investment firm of Sanford C. Bernstein 
&amp; Co. in New York, nevertheless attributed much of the decline to special 
factors similar to the aircraft situation. "This is not nearly as bad as it 
looks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One special factor, which may occur with regularity as a result of declining 
Pentagon budgets, was a 36.7% drop in defense capital goods orders. New orders 
for non-defense business equipment, normally a good indicator of capital 
investment in manufacturing, fell 13.7%. 
</P>
<P>
"If you take out the military orders decline and discount the aircraft and the 
autos, it's pretty much where we thought it would be," Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
Another big decline was recorded in orders for electrical machinery, down 
17.6%. Commerce Department statisticians attributed virtually all of the drop 
to a sharp reduction in orders for communications equipment, an industry 
particularly affected by declining defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Reaser, an analyst with First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles, concluded 
that "the overall picture is one of general weakness in manufacturing." Even 
so, she said, the January decline reflects many one-time events. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of this is explained by big declines in defense and commercial aircraft 
orders from very high levels at the end of 1989," Reaser said. "The aircraft 
industry is still strong but not sustainable at those (post-strike) levels, 
while the trend on defense spending is down -- but not so steep as this report 
suggests. A lot of these month-to-month changes are not indicative of 
longer-term trends." 
</P>
<P>
But Sinai, the Boston Co. economist, saw some ominous signs in the report. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tempting to downplay this big decline because of special factors, and 
it's true that the data overstated aircraft, which will bounce back," he said. 
"But defense orders, part of a longer-term spending downtrend, will not bounce 
back. 
</P>
<P>
"The auto industry, given sales in February, is unlikely to bounce back. And 
with the massive profits squeeze on many manufacturing industries, capital 
equipment orders are not going to bounce back."

PEOPLE: BANK OF NEW ENGLAND SET TO NAME NEW CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Columbia Savings &amp; Loan President Lawrence K. Fish is expected to be 
named as chairman and chief executive of troubled Bank of New England. 
</P>
<P>
Fish, 45, would fill the job formerly held by Walter J. Connolly Jr., who was 
ousted by the Boston bank's directors in December amid huge losses caused 
mainly by the plunge in New England's real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the bank reported a $1.1-billion loss for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The bank would not comment, and Fish could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
Fish is familiar with New England banking, having spent most of his career at 
rival Bank of Boston. The job he is expected to get had been filled temporarily 
by Ridgely Bullock, a Bank of New England director. 
</P>
<P>
Fish is used to rocky situations. Until September, he was the second-ranking 
executive at Columbia, one of the nation's most controversial savings and 
loans. Former Chief Executive Thomas Spiegel, whose family controls Columbia, 
built the thrift into the largest holder of high-risk, high-yield junk bonds in 
the savings and loan business through a close relationship to investment bank 
Drexel Burnham Lambert and its former junk bond chief Michael Milken. 
</P>
<P>
Those junk bonds made Columbia one of the most profitable thrifts in the nation 
through much of the 1980s, but lately have caused Columbia huge losses that 
have led many industry executives to wonder if it can survive. 
</P>
<P>
Fish was hired by Columbia in 1988 to give the thrift an experienced banking 
officer. He stayed just 18 months. One reason given at the time for his leaving 
was that, in reorganizing Columbia, he effectively eliminated his own job. 
Other industry executives speculated that Fish may have found it difficult 
working for a family-controlled firm and that he also may have tired of 
Columbia's growing problems. JAMES BATES

Halliburton Co. said its subsidiary, Brown &amp; Root Inc., is exploring with a 
potential buyer the sale of a major portion of its marine construction assets. 
</P>
<P>
The company did not identify the possible buyer. 
</P>
<P>
It said the assets consist primarily of offshore construction vessels in the 
United States, Middle East and Far East. 
</P>
<P>
Assets that would not be included in a sale include Brown &amp; Root's 
interests in European Marine Contractors Ltd., Rockwater Offshore Contractors, 
Highlands Fabricators and its fabrication operations in the United States and 
Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement said there was no assurance the efforts would result in a 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
Halliburton said the sale plan was part of Brown &amp; Root's strategy to 
emphasize engineering, construction, project management and maintenance in 
markets offering the most attractive growth opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Halliburton is one of the world's largest diversified oil field services,

Three Nordstrom Inc. shareholders filed a suit Tuesday against the beleaguered 
retailer, charging it with fraud by not warning investors about the potential 
financial damage stemming from its employee pay practices. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Seattle, asks the court that it be 
accepted as a class action on behalf of the approximately 76,000 Nordstrom 
stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
In the 28-page suit, Eli De Comminges, Alphonse Kaufman, and Jessica Longston 
charge that between Feb. 1, 1989, and Feb. 15, 1990, Nordstrom failed to 
adequately report the potential problems stemming from its pay practices. The 
suit seeks unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
In its fourth-quarter report, the company said it established a $15-million 
reserve for the back-pay claims.

A state resolution proposed on Tuesday asks businesses to adopt an 
environmental code of conduct if they want California's two biggest pension 
funds to invest in them. 
</P>
<P>
The Public Employees Retirement System and State Teachers Retirement System 
would be asked to consider companies' ecological track records before investing 
money in them, under the resolution introduced by state Sen. Gary K. Hart 
(D-Santa Barbara) and sponsored by Democratic Controller Gray Davis. 
</P>
<P>
The two funds have total assets of about $85 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The pension funds would be asked to assess whether companies comply with the 
so-called Valdez Principles, a 10-point environmental agenda for corporations 
formulated by the national Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies, 
or CERES, after the Exxon Valdez oil tanker spill in Alaska last year. 
</P>
<P>
By adopting the code, the companies would agree to protect the biosphere, 
conserve natural resources, reduce waste and include an ecologist on their 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
"We must encourage the development of an 'environmental ethic' in corporate 
America. Americans will not accept pollution in the name of profit," said 
Davis, a trustee for both pension funds. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said one of the pension funds -- PERS -- already has agreed to ask 27 
major companies it invests funds with to state how their policies compare to 
the Valdez Principles. 
</P>
<P>
So far, he said, eight companies have agreed to the plan: Aetna, Amoco, 
Chevron, Eastman Kodak, Mobil, Oryx Energy, Texaco and Union Carbide. 
</P>
<P>
"Shareholder activism is something we feel more confident we can get bipartisan 
support for (in the Legislature) than a divestiture policy," said Mary Raftery 
of California Public Interest Research Group, which supports Hart's 
legislation.

SOVIET PARLIAMENT OKS U.S.-STYLE PRESIDENCY;

<P>
REFORMS: A DRAFT CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT IS EASILY APPROVED. BUT LIBERAL FOES 
FEAR DICTATORIAL POWERS.

<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, wanting greater authority to promote his 
reforms, Tuesday pushed through the Supreme Soviet a proposed constitutional 
amendment providing for a new, U.S.-style presidency over objections by 
liberals that the position would be far too powerful. 
</P>
<P>
After a heated, daylong debate, deputies of the Supreme Soviet (Parliament) 
voted, 347 to 24 with 43 abstentions, on "the essential need" to establish a 
stronger, Western-style presidency, a post to which Gorbachev is certain to win 
election in two weeks' time. 
</P>
<P>
Overriding the protests of liberals that the new president would have virtual 
dictatorial powers and that further debate is required, the deputies then gave 
preliminary approval, 306-65, to the draft version of a constitutional 
amendment creating the post. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, increasingly frustrated by the government and party bureaucracy's 
opposition to many of his political and economic reforms and his consequent 
inability to pull the country out of its deepening crisis, hailed the approval 
of the proposal, a clear-cut victory for him, as "a great political event in 
the history of our state." 
</P>
<P>
"This measure is vital to press ahead with perestroika, to speed up reforms, 
protect democracy and effectively help the revolutionary transformation of our 
federation," he said. "We must remember that we are heading not only for a 
greater diversity of opinions but for greater political pluralism as well." 
</P>
<P>
But he clearly intends to use his new authority, which would include the power 
to issue decrees with the force of law, to break through many of the deadlocks 
in which his reforms are now trapped. He will also be able to declare a state 
of emergency or martial law or place regions under direct presidential rule to 
deal with the continuing civil unrest. 
</P>
<P>
"Life itself has confronted us with the need to carry out a fundamental 
regrouping of our forces at the highest echelons of power," Gorbachev said, 
suggesting that extensive governmental changes will follow. "It is imperative 
to strengthen executive power to ensure that our laws work." 
</P>
<P>
And he angrily criticized those radical deputies who had objected to the 
sweeping powers, accusing them of engaging in "cheap demagoguery" and shouting 
back at them when they protested. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who clamored for a presidency at the top of their voices just three or 
four weeks ago are claiming today that introducing the presidency is the path 
to dictatorship, to stepping on the throat of democracy and suffocating 
perestroika and burying them both," Gorbachev said. "But only people who would 
urge us to put off this most important decision are those who do not want the 
situation to change for the better." 
</P>
<P>
The measure has been controversial from the outset, and during the boisterous 
debate, sharp divisions were clear to the left and the right of the centrist 
bloc of deputies. Gorbachev played to the center as he tolerated modest 
criticism, lashed out angrily at radicals and the ultra-conservatives and 
finally argued his own case with passion. 
</P>
<P>
Many political observers, including liberals, agree that a "strong hand" is 
needed to solve the country's problems. The new political structure has proved 
cumbersome and ineffective as a combination of elements of the old system such 
as the present "collegial presidency" in the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet 
and Gorbachev's reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander N. Yakovlev, one of Gorbachev's closest associates in the party's 
ruling Politburo, said that "the collective form of power . . . eventually 
loses momentum and is marked by a bureaucratization of work processes and a 
lack of individual responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
As power is passed from the Communist Party to constitutional bodies, the 
country needs a clear leader, and even more so to guide perestroika, Yakovlev 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We already have the authority to control the leader of the country, but we 
have no leader," he added. "There is an obvious contradiction between the need 
to speed up perestroika and the weakening of government systems on all levels, 
especially in the center." 
</P>
<P>
Other deputies, arguing from a less theoretical plane, asserted that measures 
had to be taken quickly to pull the country out of its crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"We are tired from social tension. Our people are asking, 'When are you going 
to put the country in order?' " Rano A. Ubaidullayeva, an economist from 
Uzbekistan in Soviet Central Asia, told other deputies. "We need a person who 
will have real power -- the quicker, the better." 
</P>
<P>
Radicals argued, however, that the constitutional amendment would make the 
president too powerful. Recalling the abuses of power not only under the 
dictator Josef Stalin but more recently under Leonid I. Brezhnev, they asked 
repeatedly why Gorbachev needed so much additional authority and what checks 
there would be on him once elected to the new post. 
</P>
<P>
"All our decisions can be crossed out by the president," Anatoly A. Sobchak, a 
law faculty dean from Leningrad, told the other lawmakers, outlining the 
president's veto powers and his authority to rule by decree. 
</P>
<P>
Sergei B. Stankevich, a political scientist, said he agreed that there was "a 
real need for executive power" but felt that, "if the law is adopted in its 
present form, the president can do almost everything." 
</P>
<P>
"We can still feel the great totalitarian tradition in this country," 
Stankevich added, "and this is a good reason for us not to be too hasty." 
</P>
<P>
The measure, in a significant reduction of the party's once-total authority, 
clearly envisions the president as "above" the ruling Communist Party and 
responsible to the country as a whole. That would represent a further 
separation of the party's functions from those of the state. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal now goes to legislative committees for review and possible 
inclusion of changes suggested during the debate with final approval by the 
Supreme Soviet expected early next week. 
</P>
<P>
It will then be considered on March 12 and 13 by a two-day special session of 
the Congress of People's Deputies, the full national legislature, as a 
constitutional amendment. If the amendment is approved, the 2,250-member 
Congress will then elect a president for an initial four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the Soviet president will be elected directly by the nation's voters in 
another reform intended to make the country more democratic. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir N. Kudryavtsev, a leading constitutional lawyer and political 
scientist, who oversaw the drafting of the amendment, noted that the president 
would have the power to proclaim a state of emergency, to declare war if the 
Soviet Union were attacked, to name the prime minister and other key ministers, 
to conduct foreign policy, to veto legislation and to dissolve the 
parliamentary and legislative bodies and call new elections. 
</P>
<P>
The president would also coordinate the work of a new federal council that 
would deal with the central government's relations with the country's 15 
constituent republics and his own presidential council, which would make basic 
policy decisions. 
</P>
<P>
The president's decrees could be appealed to the new Committee of 
Constitutional Supervision, according to Kudryavtsev, and the Congress of 
People's Deputies would have the authority to cancel them. 
</P>
<P>
The draft amendment, in another political first, provides for the impeachment 
of a president if he or she violates the constitution or the law, and it 
provides a detailed line of succession if the president is unable to fulfill 
his duties. A president is limited to two terms, which generally will be five 
years each. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies from the Soviet Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania 
announced they would not participate in the debate over any of the votes on the 
proposed presidency because they believe it inappropriate to do so before their 
future in the Soviet Union is resolved.

NORTHROP FINED $17 MILLION IN FRAUD CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Northrop Corp. pleaded guilty to 34 criminal fraud charges Tuesday and agreed 
to pay the government $17 million, one of the largest fines ever assessed a 
defense contractor, to end a massive criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very significant victory in our efforts to combat defense 
contracting fraud and misconduct," said Assistant U.S. Atty. William F. Fahey, 
lead prosecutor in the case. 
</P>
<P>
The large fine, Fahey asserted, will be "a tremendous deterrent to corporations 
who choose to cut corners on certifications (of tests) on significant military 
programs." He said investigators for the Air Force and the Navy, several of 
whom were in the courtroom, had spent the better part of three years developing 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop spokesman Tony Cantafio said the plea agreement was "in the best 
interest of all parties involved." The company issued a formal statement saying 
that the agreement represented "a complex compromise." 
</P>
<P>
The government agreed to drop 141 counts against Northrop and charges against 
two executives in return for a guilty plea on 34 counts of making false 
statements. The counts that were dropped included 139 charges of making false 
statements and two conspiracy charges. The guilty plea came on what was to have 
been the first day of a lengthy trial against the Century City-based defense 
contractor. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the government agreed "not to prosecute, file criminal charges, 
or seek indictments" in certain investigations of the company, which were 
listed in sealed court papers mentioned in another document filed in connection 
with the plea agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop has been the subject of at least five investigations by the 
government, including allegations that tests on the MX missile were falsified, 
that the company overcharged the government on the B-2 stealth bomber, and that 
the company made improper payments to South Koreans. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear from documents filed Tuesday whether those investigations were 
among those that the Justice Department agreed not to prosecute. The Justice 
Department would not comment on how extensive that part of the agreement is. 
</P>
<P>
"The resolution of all these other pending investigations and the government's 
decision not to prosecute on them after all these highly publicized allegations 
were made over such a long period of time has to raise questions about the 
validity of those allegations in the first place," said Les Daly, Northrop's 
senior vice president for corporate affairs. 
</P>
<P>
However, another Northrop spokesman said the company could not disclose any 
details about the sealed papers. 
</P>
<P>
An aide to Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), one of the most outspoken critics of 
Northrop, said: "Why would such a list be sealed? That is outrageous. I am 
shocked. I don't think Congress is going to be too happy about that." 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1989, a federal grand jury in Los Angeles indicted Northrop and five 
current and former employees on fraud charges for allegedly falsifying tests on 
components for nuclear-armed cruise missiles and for supplying equipment that 
they knew failed to meet government specifications. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment alleged that the company also defrauded the government by 
improperly testing components for the AV-8B Harrier jets, used by the Marine 
Corps. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the indictments, Fahey said that the allegations were among the 
most serious of any defense case of its type because the weapons were 
nuclear-armed and because the allegedly fraudulent activity went on for 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 34 counts of false statements that Northrop pleaded guilty to, 23 
involved the cruise missile and 11 involved the Harrier. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Circuit Judge Pamela A. Rymer, who has been presiding over the case, 
agreed to accept the pleas in a brief courtroom hearing. 
</P>
<P>
As a critical element of the plea agreement, the government agreed to dismiss 
charges against two high-ranking Northrop executives. They were accused of a 
conspiracy to supply missile guidance parts that contained a fluid that would 
freeze during operation at temperatures required under the contract. 
</P>
<P>
The company did not plead guilty to any of those charges, a point that was 
emphasized by lawyers for the two men, Joseph Yamron, 62, a corporate vice 
president and general manager of the firm's precision products division in 
Newton, Mass., and Northrop Vice President Leopold Engler, 60, also of 
Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
Engler has "been vindicated," said his lawyer, Richard Kendall. "We're pleased 
with the outcome. The 'cold temperature' charges were dropped totally," he 
said, referring to the allegations about the fluid. 
</P>
<P>
Both Yamron and Engler have been on administrative leave with pay since the 
charges were filed. Yamron's lawyer, Walter Bonner, said he expected his client 
would return to active duty with the company as early as today.) "He absolutely 
maintains his innocence." 
</P>
<P>
Northrop spokesman Cantafio said both men would return to work soon. 
</P>
<P>
Fahey said he thought dropping the charges against the two executives was an 
"appropriate resolution." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the afternoon, Clarence Gonsalves, a former Northrop plant manager 
in El Monte, where much of the illegal activity occurred, pleaded guilty to 
eight counts of the 175-count indictment, including conspiracy and falsifying 
test results. 
</P>
<P>
Gonsalves' lawyer, Vicki Podbersky, told Rymer that under an agreement reached 
with the government, prosecutors would recommend a three-year maximum sentence. 
However, she also acknowledged that he faced a potential fine of $1.28 million. 
Rymer set sentencing for Gonsalves for May 1. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Fahey said the government had agreed to give the other defendant in 
the case, Cheryl Hannan, a former quality assurance supervisor, pretrial 
diversion, essentially a form of probation. She was not required to make a 
guilty plea or pay a fine. 
</P>
<P>
Hannan also had been accused of conspiracy and participating in the falsifying 
of test results on the cruise missile. 
</P>
<P>
The fifth Northrop employee indicted in the case, Howard Hyde, an engineering 
supervisor in the Pomona plant, pleaded guilty to three counts of making false 
statements last year. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations to resolve the case were launched last Wednesday, Fahey said, as 
jury selection was being completed. Tuesday morning, the lawyers appeared at 
the courthouse, but did not give their opening statements as scheduled. 
Instead, they held a series of meetings leading up to the settlement. U.S. 
District Judge W. Matthew Byrne Jr. acted as mediator. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop still faces civil fraud charges for allegedly faking tests on cruise 
missile parts. Rymer said that she would not require Northrop to pay any 
additional restitution because of the pending civil cases. 
</P>
<P>
Until Tuesday, the largest criminal fine was believed to be the $5.5 million 
paid by Rockwell International in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
A House Armed Services Committee source late Tuesday questioned whether the 
admission of guilt would prejudice the military services against Northrop in 
future contracts, since the Pentagon has established a policy of using past 
performance on contracts in awarding future work. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop produced components for the cruise missile at its Western Services 
Department, a small operation located first in El Monte and then in Pomona, 
that reported to the precision products division in Newton, Mass. The Western 
Services Department was shut down in December, 1987, after reports about faked 
tests became public. The work was moved to the Massachusetts plant. 
</P>
<P>
The operation produced a key guidance component called a flight data 
transmitter, which is used in air-launched cruise missiles designed for the 
B-52 and B-1 bombers. Northrop produced and shipped about 1,175 transmitters 
between 1981 and 1989 for use in the missiles. 
</P>
<P>
During congressional hearings in 1988, Northrop's former vice president Frank 
Lynch conceded: "We discovered a problem at our Pomona plant with regard to 
practices there which involved a number of programs in which test results were 
not properly represented, where . . . (we) falsified test results." 
</P>
<P>
Northrop officials said that they had shut down the small operation and fired 
four employees. Northrop attorneys Richard Sauber and Brad Brian said in court 
Tuesday that test results had been falsified and that employees falsely 
certified that tests had been performed. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Sauber acknowledged that certificates of conformance with 
contract standards that had been filed by Northrop employees were false 
"because particular flight data transmitters either had failed product 
reliability verification testing or had been subject to incomplete . . . 
testing." 
</P>
<P>
After the late afternoon hearing, Northrop spokesman Cantafio asserted that "as 
of late summer, there had been only six failures out of 98" tests performed on 
cruise missile parts made by Northrop, and he said none of the failures had 
been attributed to the flight data transmitters. He said he did not know what 
accounted for the failures.

CHAMORRO JOINS ORTEGA IN URGING CONTRAS TO DISBAND 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro joined the defeated Sandinista 
government Tuesday night in urging the U.S.-backed Contras to disarm 
immediately and end their eight-year-old rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
"The causes of this civil war have disappeared," Chamorro said in her first 
substantive message since her stunning electoral upset of President Daniel 
Ortega on Sunday. "There is no reason for more war. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who rose up in arms ought to put down their rifles and return peacefully 
to their families to work for the reconstruction of our country," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro broadcast her plea on the radio after Ortega, in a speech to thousands 
of militant supporters, put the rebels' disarmament at the top of a list of 
conditions for a peaceful transfer of power to her 14-party National Opposition 
Union, known as UNO. 
</P>
<P>
Talks on those issues, including control of the army and privatization of 
public property, began late Tuesday, after the government's Supreme Electoral 
Council formally declared the 60-year-old newspaper publisher the winner of 
Sunday's vote. Chamorro's representative met with Gen. Humberto Ortega, the 
president's brother and defense minister. 
</P>
<P>
A similar appeal to the Contras came Tuesday from President Rafael Leonardo 
Callejas of Honduras, where most of the 10,000-strong Contra army is camped. He 
said the Sandinistas' electoral defeat offered "better democratic guarantees in 
Nicaragua for the quick repatriation" of the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Contra leaders in Honduras, while welcoming Chamorro's victory, have rejected 
that argument so far, saying they want to see if the new government can take 
effective control of the Sandinista army after her April 25 inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
"We will return to Nicaragua when the Sandinistas abandon power," the Contra 
chief of staff, Israel Galeano, told reporters Monday. "We are a cancer that no 
one wants. That is why we should act with caution in the face of events taking 
place in Nicaragua." 
</P>
<P>
With training and assistance from the United States, the rebel army began 
fighting to topple the Sandinistas three years after they seized power in a 
1979 guerrilla uprising. 
</P>
<P>
Their forces have been weakened by a series of Central American peace 
initiatives that led to Sunday's election in Nicaragua. The U.S. Congress cut 
off their military aid two years ago, and the region's four other presidents 
joined Ortega last August in urging them to disband before Sunday's election. 
</P>
<P>
But that accord was ignored by the Bush Administration, which continued to feed 
the Contras, and never explicitly supported until now by Chamorro and other 
leaders of her coalition. Some of those politicians, including one of 
Chamorro's sons, are former Contra leaders who continued to identify with the 
rebel cause after returning here from exile. 
</P>
<P>
Her firm endorsement of the regional accord Tuesday night cleared the way for 
two months of bargaining with the government on her coalition's program for a 
"government of national salvation." 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro named her son-in-law and campaign manager, Antonio Lacayo, to head 
those negotiations with Humberto Ortega. The two men met for the first time 
Tuesday night, with former U.S. President Jimmy Carter as a mediator. They are 
to hold another meeting today, with their transition staffs. 
</P>
<P>
UNO's electoral platform calls for dramatic changes that would scale down the 
army and the revolutionary state built during a decade of Sandinista rule and 
give freer reign to private enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro's margin of victory, 55% of the vote to Ortega's 41%, has raised 
expectations among her supporters that hundreds of Sandinista party officials 
will be evicted from homes and lands that were seized from the 
pre-revolutionary owners. 
</P>
<P>
But in winning 52 of the National Assembly's 90 seats, UNO fell short of the 
two-thirds majority it needed to make constitutional changes. That means some 
elements of its program, such as ending the constitutionally protected state 
monopolies on banking and foreign trade, will require Sandinista consent. 
</P>
<P>
And without the power to change the constitution, Chamorro's government could 
be stuck with a Supreme Court made up mostly of Sandinista-appointed justices 
for most of its six-year term. 
</P>
<P>
More important, UNO leaders acknowledge that the Sandinistas' control of the 
army and their ability to mobilize militant supporters in the streets make it 
inevitable that Chamorro's conservative program will be watered down in 
bargaining over the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be harder than the normal transition," said Alfredo Cesar, one 
of Chamorro's closest advisers and a former Contra leader. "That means the two 
sides are going to have to sit down and make sure the transition is 
accomplished in a peaceful manner." 
</P>
<P>
President Ortega began that process by paying a visit to Chamorro at her home 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I bring an olive branch of peace," Ortega told her, kissing her on both 
cheeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Come here my darling," she quipped. "I love you so much." She added: "There 
are neither winners nor losers here." 
</P>
<P>
That scene, and Ortega's dramatic concession speech 12 hours earlier, seemed to 
offer the promise of peaceful change in a country torn by nearly a decade of 
guerrilla war and a history of rigged elections. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, however, the Sandinistas dramatized their power by turning out 
thousands of party militants to hear Ortega's conditions for a smooth 
transition. 
</P>
<P>
"A change of government does not mean the end of the revolution," Ortega 
declared. Reading a statement from the party leadership, he said it would turn 
over power to Chamorro's coalition but still had "the responsibility to watch 
over and guarantee the continuity of the revolutionary process." 
</P>
<P>
The statement said the Sandinistas would "defend the integrity and 
professionalism of the army and the police forces." 
</P>
<P>
Ortega's appointment of his brother to head the negotiations underscores the 
delicacy of the issue of control of those military forces. Both are closely 
identified with the Sandinista party, and the army is known as the Sandinista 
People's Army. 
</P>
<P>
UNO has promised to end compulsory military service and reduce the size of the 
70,000-man army. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, meeting with reporters before Chamorro's announcement, said that 
Humberto Ortega and Interior Minister Tomas Borge, who controls the police, had 
agreed in principal to give up their posts but are reluctant to do so as long 
as the Contras are still fighting. 
</P>
<P>
"They expressed their conviction that (disarming the Contras) has to be done 
before they are willing to leave the country defenseless," Carter said. "I 
think this is a reasonable statement of fact. It's not an ultimatum or demand." 
</P>
<P>
The Sandinista statement said the party, as the strongest, most cohesive 
political force in the country, would also oppose any change in its land 
redistribution program, the sale of state-owned banks or mineral rights, or 
cutbacks in benefits to wounded Sandinista war veterans and war widows. It 
demanded that the jobs of all public workers be guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
Privatization is a fundamental part of UNO's economic program. It hopes to 
reduce the public sector and return inefficient state-owned industries to the 
private sector. An UNO commission is also studying the cases of hundreds of 
Sandinista militants who live in state-owned houses and drive state-owned 
vehicles, many of them confiscated from opponents of the government. 
</P>
<P>
After reading the statement, Ortega emphasized that the party intended to turn 
over the government to UNO, but said UNO voters would soon discover their 
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone who voted for UNO will vote for the Sandinista Front in the future," 
he said. "The ball is in the other court." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he emphasized, "there will be no steps back from the fundamental 
conquests of the revolution," Ortega said in his speech. 
</P>
<P>
Some opposition leaders dismissed Ortega's speech as rhetoric. "This is just a 
drowning man kicking," said business leader Gilberto Cuadra. 
</P>
<P>
But others took it as a warning that the negotiations will be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important change in Nicaragua is not that UNO won or the Sandinista 
Front went down to defeat but that we are entering a new form of governing, by 
negotiation rather than imposition," said Emilio Alvarez Montalban, another 
Chamorro aide. 
</P>
<P>
In her radio address, Chamorro expressed "my commitment to respect the will of 
the 40% minority that voted for the Sandinista Front" and "my desire to be 
president of all Nicaraguans." 
</P>
<P>
Rafael Solis, a Sandinista leader in the National Assembly, said: "These next 
60 days, more than the elections, are going to decide the future of this 
country."

MISSION VIEJO RECALL EFFORT FIRMLY REJECTED; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: SLOW-GROWTH ADVOCATE RETAINS COUNCIL SEAT BY A 2-1 MARGIN DESPITE 
DEVELOPERS' $500,000 CAMPAIGN TO OUST HIM. 
</P>

<P>
Despite nearly $500,000 in contributions from developers and real estate 
interests that were trying to oust him, Mission Viejo City Councilman Robert A. 
Curtis, a slow-growth advocate, easily won a recall battle Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel fabulous," said Curtis, who won by a margin of more than than 2 to 1. 
"This is the landslide victory that nobody expected." 
</P>
<P>
With all 37 precincts reporting, 8,679 voters rejected the recall; 3,835 voted 
for it. Slightly more than 33% of the city's registered voters cast ballots, 
election officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The results, Curtis said, "will demonstrate that Mission Viejo voters are 
intelligent people who can cut through a half-million-dollar campaign of 
deceit." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to bolstering Curtis' political standing, the victory marked a 
stinging rejection of Mission Viejo Co.'s role in the campaign. The company, 
which planned and built the Orange County city, spent more than $250,000 trying 
to unseat Curtis, an amount that raised eyebrows all the way to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Other developers were also active in the fund-raising, and more than 90% of the 
recall committee's budget came from developer or real estate interests. That 
money bought the advice of a political consultant and paid for several mailers 
as well as a phone bank and precinct workers. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo Co. also backed Measure A, which would require that city voters 
review all large annexation proposals. That measure won easily. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy Wetzel, a spokeswoman for the company, said officials were not 
disappointed with Tuesday's outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't look at this as a one-time expenditure," she said. "We looked at it 
as an investment in the community, and these issues have now gotten a thorough 
debate. . . . We will abide by what the voters decide." 
</P>
<P>
Helen Monroe, who chaired the pro-recall Alliance for Mission Viejo, maintained 
that the group's intent was to remove Curtis from office because he was a 
divisive and rude presence on the council and because he supported a 
controversial annexation proposal even after residents petitioned the council 
to drop the matter. 
</P>
<P>
In the southern Orange County bedroom community of 75,000 residents, which 
until two years ago had little experience with confrontational politics, 
tempers flared especially high in this campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis' opponents called him a liar and said he distorted facts to suit his 
political purposes. He in turn lashed out at his opponents, referring to the 
three-member council majority as the "three stooges" and accusing them of 
consistently backing the interests of the Mission Viejo Co. over those of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
"It has just gotten to be too much," said Mayor Christian W. Keena, who 
endorsed the recall. "Meetings were being disrupted, Curtis was distorting 
facts so much that they just weren't facts anymore. I just couldn't stand by." 
</P>
<P>
While the council waged its own struggles, Mission Viejo Co.'s assertive 
opposition to Curtis made the company almost as important an issue as the 
councilman himself. Throughout the campaign, Curtis, a 34-year-old lawyer, 
directed pointed barbs at the firm, accusing it of trying to force him out of 
office as a way of ridding the council of his slow-growth views. 
</P>
<P>
Recall proponents vigorously denied those allegations. "Bob Curtis just lies so 
often, the truth doesn't seem to matter to him," Monroe said. 
</P>
<P>
The issues raised by recall advocates, however, were overshadowed by the 
mounting campaign contributions that they accepted from Mission Viejo Co., 
which poured more than $135,000 into the recall effort in the final two weeks 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Fair Political Practices Commission in Sacramento said they 
could not remember another recall election in which a single contributor had 
donated so much money. 
</P>
<P>
And local observers, including some Curtis foes, worried that the money was 
excessive. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame that so much money had to be put into this campaign," said 
Councilman Norman P. Murray, a recall supporter. "It's meant that money has 
become the issue, and Curtis has never had to respond to the charges against 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Keena agreed, saying, "One can't help but be astounded by the amount of money, 
and I think that's definitely had a negative backlash."

SACRAMENTO KILLS $50-MILLION BID TO LURE RAIDERS;

<P>
The City Council late Tuesday night voted to kill the city's offer to pay a $50 
million "franchise fee" to attract the Los Angeles Raiders to the capital, 
effective midnight tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The vote came as part of a motion that also directed that a 5% admission tax to 
repay bonds sold to raise the fee be deferred until July 1, 1991, and that a 
1.5% increase in the city's hotel bed tax be deferred for 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
The vote on the motion was 5 to 3 after lengthy debate on the possibility of 
using the money that had been destined for the National Football League team 
for other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Not a single council member spoke up in favor of keeping the offer to the 
Raiders alive. The three negative votes had to do with how the money would be 
spent in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The vote came one day after Raiders owner Al Davis called Sacramento Mayor Anne 
Rudin to say that he was not ready to commit to move his team to either 
Sacramento or Oakland, or to stay in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Rudin and other council members noted that the Sacramento offer had been held 
open for 90 days, a period they felt was long enough for Davis to make up his 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor said that she felt the end of the Raiders deal was "a good thing. . . 
. The city comes out stronger, because we understand the way the game is played 
at soliciting professional teams. We may be a little wiser now." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Joe Serna Jr., who had been the prime official booster of the offer, 
said he felt that any chance of the city getting the team now was over. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it was a lost exercise, however," he said, "because I think 
people have taken notice of Sacramento more than ever before." 
</P>
<P>
The only person present who held out any hope for the deal was developer Angelo 
Tsakapoulos, one of four partners in the private group that has sought to build 
a stadium for the team. He said he felt that if Davis changed his mind in the 
next 30 days, the council would reconsider its position. 
</P>
<P>
Rudin and other council members denied such a possibility.

BID TO BAR FUND TRANSFER FOR MILITARY JOBS ASSAILED; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: THE PENTAGON SAYS ASPIN'S OPPOSITION TO THE BUDGET MOVE WOULD FORCE 
LAYOFFS OF AS MANY AS 68,000 PEOPLE IN UNIFORM.

<P>
Congress is gambling with tens of thousands of military careers in a game of 
brinkmanship over how to meet federal deficit reduction targets, Bush 
Administration officials charged Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Department officials criticized attempts by House Armed Services 
Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.) to deny a Pentagon request to divert 
funds to personnel from other department accounts in order to save military 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Defense officials called Aspin's plan "a really terrible idea" and said it 
would force the military to lay off as many as 68,000 officers and enlisted men 
before the end of the year, contrasted with 23,600 that the Pentagon proposes 
to trim. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really going to be nasty" if Aspin carries out his threat, Pentagon 
spokesman Pete Williams said. "It's really going to be fire and brimstone." 
</P>
<P>
At issue is a Pentagon request to "re-program" $777 million in the department's 
fiscal year 1990 budget. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed diversion of funds from other military uses into Army, Navy and 
Air Force personnel accounts would allow the Pentagon to comply with spending 
reductions mandated by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit-reduction law without 
making drastic military manpower cuts. 
</P>
<P>
But Aspin, in a letter sent Monday to members of the Armed Services Committee, 
said he would ignore the Administration's request. 
</P>
<P>
The committee chairman accused the White House of welshing on a deal cut last 
year to meet the Gramm-Rudman targets. 
</P>
<P>
"I do this with great reluctance because it will cause real pain," Aspin said 
in the letter. "But it is absolutely necessary . . . . If we don't stand firm 
now, this Administration will have us playing 'chicken' with the budget every 
year, distorting the deficit reduction process and relying on us to save it 
from its more irresponsible excesses." 
</P>
<P>
Although they require the approval of Congress, such spending shifts are 
routine and usually handled with little notice or debate. But with the current 
intense scrutiny of the defense budget and congressional Democrats' desire to 
cash in on a presumed "peace dividend," the routine has suddenly become 
controversial. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats may be retaliating for a Pentagon plan to close three dozen domestic 
military bases, most of them in Democratic congressional districts, or using 
the threatened personnel cuts as leverage in defense budget negotiations, 
Capitol Hill sources speculated. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy also could be a congressional attempt to punish the Administration 
for proposed cuts in social programs popular with Democrats, they said. 
</P>
<P>
At a Pentagon briefing Tuesday, Williams blasted Aspin's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"This would have an absolutely devastating effect on our men and women in 
uniform . . . it goes in precisely the wrong direction," he said. "If we are 
going to achieve those sorts of reductions, we have to be allowed to do it in a 
deliberate, carefully planned way. You don't simply reach in and yank out a 
certain number of people in the force." 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon in December proposed to trim 23,600 uniformed personnel from the 
Army and Air Force to meet the required $1.7 billion in Gramm-Rudman cuts from 
the 1990 budget. Further personnel cuts were avoided by the request to 
re-program the $777 million into personnel accounts from other Pentagon budget 
lines, such as operations, maintainence, procurement and research. 
</P>
<P>
If the re-programming is denied, Williams said, the military services will 
immediately have to begin laying off from 44,000 to 68,000 people, denying 
promotions, curtailing enlistments and freezing rotations to new assignments. 
</P>
<P>
"This rather crude approach of denying us the re-programming authority would be 
devastating to the morale of our men and women in uniform, because it would do 
it in a totally thoughtless way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Congress, in authorizing the 1990 budget, specifically gave 
the Pentagon permission to divert the funds "to minimize the negative effects 
on the welfare and quality of life of military personnel."

NARCOTICS: AGENCY CHIEF PRESSURED MEXICAN OFFICIALS IN CAMARENA CASE. HE IS TO 
BE A VICE PRESIDENT WITH THE NEW YORK TEAM.

John C. Lawn, who has headed the Drug Enforcement Administration for five 
tumultuous years, will resign next month to become an executive with the New 
York Yankees, the agency announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The former FBI agent presided over record increases in the ranks of 
drug-fighting agents but insisted from the start that the war on drugs could 
not be won through law enforcement alone. 
</P>
<P>
An outspoken official during his early days in office, Lawn mounted a 
relentless campaign to pressure the Mexican government to investigate the 
involvement of its high-level officials in the brutal murder of DEA agent 
Enrique (Kiki) Camarena. 
</P>
<P>
But in recent months Lawn had been overshadowed by Office of National Drug 
Control Policy chief William J. Bennett and other high-ranking Bush 
Administration officials who took over the spotlight on drug-related issues 
after President Bush placed them at the top of his national agenda. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing his resignation, Lawn, 54, said his tenure had been "most 
rewarding and most satisfying." He said only that he planned to resettle in the 
New York area. 
</P>
<P>
But associates said that Lawn, who began his career as a high school basketball 
coach, is to become vice president of operations for the Yankees, a new team 
management position. 
</P>
<P>
They said Lawn had established a close relationship with Yankee owner George 
Steinbrenner during their work on a DEA program to curb drug use among 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh cited that pioneering effort by Lawn 
as an example of what he called "extraordinary leadership . . . during an 
extremely challenging time." 
</P>
<P>
Lawn took over the agency in 1985, when it was rocked by the Camarena slaying. 
The agent and his Mexican pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar, were kidnaped, tortured 
and murdered in what Lawn called "the most traumatic incident in the agency's 
history." 
</P>
<P>
Angered at a lack of cooperation from Mexico, the DEA chief mounted a pressure 
campaign that persuaded the Mexican government to release evidence that 
incriminated government officials. Lawn's role was dramatized last month in the 
television miniseries, "Drug Wars: The Camarena Story." 
</P>
<P>
A DEA spokesman said a major reason for Lawn's departure after 27 years of 
government service was that he would soon turn 55, mandatory retirement age for 
federal law enforcement officers. While the top DEA post is exempt from that 
requirement, the official said that Lawn -- who served for 15 years in the FBI 
-- always prized his special-agent status and did not want to continue as DEA 
chief without it.

EXILES' CHEERS GREET MANDELA ON ZAMBIA VISIT;

AFRICA: THE ANC LEADER LEAVES SOUTH AFRICA FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A QUARTER 
CENTURY. HE SAYS HE WANTS TO MEET 'HEROES' IN THE FIGHT AGAINST APARTHEID.

<P>
Freed black nationalist Nelson R. Mandela, launching his first foreign journey 
in a quarter century, arrived at African National Congress headquarters here 
Tuesday to an emotional welcome from South African exiles, few of whom had ever 
laid eyes on the man they consider their leader. 
</P>
<P>
Lauding the thousands of ANC members who live and work in the southern African 
country, Mandela said he was "looking forward to meeting the heroes I have 
looked to during my last 27 years in prison." 
</P>
<P>
The ANC, the primary guerrilla group fighting Pretoria, was banned in South 
Africa two years before Mandela was jailed in 1962, and it has operated from 
offices here for well over a decade. It now is making plans for a gradual 
return home following President Frederik W. de Klerk's decision to legalize it. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela's trip brought him into the fold of black-ruled nations in Africa who 
have fought to maintain world pressure on Pretoria to end racial segregation 
and give the black majority a vote in national affairs. Zambian President 
Kenneth D. Kaunda and six other African heads of state greeted Mandela, his 
wife, Winnie, and their delegation at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
"Viva, Mandela, Viva!" cried hundreds of ANC supporters who gathered at the 
airport and lined parts of the 15-mile road into town. The 71-year-old leader 
waded into the crowd to greet groups of school children and women as they sang 
songs praising him. 
</P>
<P>
"The people of Africa are waiting to hear from you," said Kaunda, who as a 
leader of the so-called "front-line states" -- countries surrounding South 
Africa -- has been one of the ANC's most outspoken supporters over the years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a special moment for all of us," added the president, meeting Mandela for 
the first time. "We love you. We respect you. We consider you a leader of the 
ANC, a leader of the South African people (and also) our leader." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela thanked Kaunda for "playing the role of peacemaker under difficult 
conditions." Kaunda has met with De Klerk and his predecessor, Pieter W. Botha, 
to persuade him to talk with the ANC, and this impoverished capital has been a 
second home for the organization. 
</P>
<P>
From Lusaka, the ANC's "remarkable team of men have built the organization into 
a powerful force," Mandela said. "They have loved and directed our people to 
the point where we feel we are on the edge of a breakthrough in our struggle 
for freedom." 
</P>
<P>
Zambia is the first stop on an 18-day trip that will take the Mandelas and 
their colleague, Walter Sisulu, to Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Sweden. He plans to 
meet for the first time with the ANC's 35-member Executive Committee here later 
in the week. 
</P>
<P>
Among topics for discussion will be the upcoming meeting between the ANC and De 
Klerk in South Africa and what role Mandela will play in the liberation 
movement. 
</P>

Mandela's delegation will visit ANC military training camps and educational

ENRILE ARRESTED IN DECEMBER COUP BID; 
</P>
<P>
PHILIPPINES: THE SENATOR IS A POLITICAL FOE OF AQUINO. HE IS VIEWED AS A MENTOR 
OF MUTINOUS YOUNG SOLDIERS.

President Corazon Aquino's government arrested Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, a key 
opposition leader, inside the Philippine Senate late Tuesday on a charge of 
rebellion and murder stemming from the December coup attempt that nearly 
toppled Aquino's government. 
</P>
<P>
Enrile, a co-leader of the 1986 military revolt that helped catapult Aquino to 
power, was charged with causing the death of a boy killed by a rebel plane on 
the first day of the bloody Dec. 1-9 military uprising. 
</P>
<P>
The surprise arrest of Aquino's lone Senate opponent and harshest public critic 
is likely to increase political pressure on her struggling four-year-old 
administration, which faces almost daily threats of a seventh coup attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Enrile, 66, a flamboyant political leader and former defense secretary under 
both Aquino and the late President Ferdinand E. Marcos, is seen as a mentor to 
many of the young soldiers responsible for the six military uprisings. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino has been heavily criticized in the past for not punishing coup 
ringleaders. Enrile, a Harvard-trained lawyer, is the most prominent figure 
ever to be indicted in a Philippine coup attempt. Six other civilians were also 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
Enrile was taken into custody in the Senate president's office shortly after he 
delivered an emotional speech on the packed Senate floor. Red-eyed and his 
voice choked with emotion, he shook hands and said goodby to most of his 
colleagues before leaving the building with Alfredo Lim, director of the 
National Bureau of Investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The two men drove away in Enrile's bulletproof van. After providing photos of 
himself to police, Enrile met with reporters through the night in Lim's plush 
air-conditioned office. Officials said it was unclear when or if he would be 
jailed. 
</P>
<P>
Enrile, who was martial-law administrator under Marcos, was implicated but 
never charged in a 1986 coup attempt against Aquino. He has denied any 
complicity in the most recent mutiny. Instead, he portrayed his arrest as a 
blow against freedom and democracy, warning that Aquino will have to "answer to 
God and history." 
</P>
<P>
"I really hope that history will remember that there was one soul who lit a 
candle of freedom," Enrile told reporters at the Senate building. "And hoped it 
would flicker. And that one soul is named Juan Ponce Enrile. 
</P>
<P>
"They are giving me a rare opportunity to bring to public attention the 
corruption, the oppression and the lack of justice in our lives," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The formal combined charge of "rebellion . . . murder and multiple frustrated 
murder" carries a maximum penalty of life in prison, prosecutors said. Enrile 
was also charged with harboring rebel leaders during the height of the coup. 
</P>
<P>
The December uprising left more than 113 dead and 500 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino and Enrile have traded bitter barbs in recent weeks in a personal and 
political grudge that dates back to when Enrile jailed her late husband, 
Benigno S. (Ninoy) Aquino Jr., for nearly eight years in the 1970s. Aquino, the 
longest held prisoner of Marcos' political opponents, was assassinated at 
Manila airport when he returned from exile in the United States on Aug. 21, 
1983. Six years later, that case is still in court here. 
</P>
<P>
Also charged in Tuesday's filing was former army Lt. Col. Gregorio (Gringo) 
Honasan, a former Enrile aide who already has a $250,000 bounty on his head as 
a career coup plotter, and Rodolfo Aguinaldo, another former aide who was 
recently suspended as governor of Cagayan province for announcing over Manila 
radio that he was sending tanks and artillery to the capital to support the 
coup attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Others charged were retired Brig. Gen. Felix Brawner and retired Lt. Col. Billy 
Bibit, who the government alleges were key coup leaders. Charges were also 
filed against a Manila hotel owner, Rebecco Panlilio, and his wife, Erlinda. 
Prosecutors said they provided food for a party that Enrile threw for Honasan 
and 100 armed rebel troops during the first night's fighting. 
</P>
<P>
A 25-page court document filed with the charges alleges that Enrile also met 
with coup leaders at the Hotel Inter-Continental in Makati while rebel troops 
were occupying the swanky financial district of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, senior state prosecutor Aurelio G. Trampe said Enrile is 
considered a "participant" rather than a coup sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
"We charge conspiracy," Trampe said. "When there is a conspiracy, the act of 
one is the act of all. The guilt of one is the guilt of all in this 
conspiracy." 
</P>
<P>
Under that theory, Enrile is charged with murder in the death of Rolando 
Estrada, who died when a rebel T-28 "Tora-Tora" plane tried to bomb the 
government-run Channel 4 television complex in suburban Quezon City and instead 
hit several houses. Four other people were wounded in the blast. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Secretary Franklin Drillon said prosecutors recommended against 
granting bail, but a department spokesman said later that a judge could 
overrule the recommendation when Enrile is arraigned. No date was set. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino issued no comment, but her spokesman, Tomas Gomez, praised the 
prosecutors' action. "What we are witnessing today is the effective operation 
of our criminal justice system under a constitutional democracy," Gomez said. 
"Crimes have been committed, criminals have been identified, and therefore, 
cases have to be filed."

SANDINISTAS WILL STRUGGLE ON, CUBA SAYS;

OF POLITICAL BANKRUPTCY FOR HIS LEFTIST CAUSE.

Cuba's Communist Party newspaper Granma said Tuesday that Nicaragua's 
Sandinista revolution is entering "a new stage of struggle" after the defeat of 
the leftist government in elections Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that it is a great setback, but it doesn't mean political 
bankruptcy (for the Sandinistas)," Granma said in an editorial. 
</P>
<P>
"The Nicaraguan revolution has passed through a tough test and is entering a 
new stage of struggle," it added. 
</P>
<P>
Cuba had been one of the closest allies of the Sandinista government since the 
1979 revolution. President Daniel Ortega lost his reelection bid in an upset to 
U.S-backed candidate Violeta Barrios de Chamorro. 
</P>
<P>
Granma said the surprise victory of Chamorro and her National Opposition Union 
(UNO) does not necessarily mean a vote against the historic role of the 
Sandinistas, who led the popular 1979 revolution against dictator Anastasio 
Somoza. 
</P>
<P>
The paper did not comment on Cuba's relations with the new Nicaraguan 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Voters were obliged to choose in Sunday's elections between the Sandinistas and 
"U.S. imperialism," Granma said. 
</P>
<P>
It said the United States had indicated that a victory for Ortega would have 
meant the continuation of its economic blockade against Nicaragua and of the 
Contra guerrilla war against the Sandinistas. 
</P>
<P>
"The Nicaraguan electorate was faced with the contradiction that a victory for 
Sandinismo would not mean the end of the war or the lifting of the blockade or 
the end of sanctions," Granma said. 
</P>
<P>
It added that International Monetary Fund-style reforms adopted by the 
Sandinista government have also created discontent among poor sectors of the 
population. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor, Granma said, is that traditional allies of the Sandinista 
government in Eastern Europe have been plunged into political and economic 
uncertainty by what the paper called "historical retrogression," a reference to 
Western-leaning reforms sweeping the Soviet Bloc.

SOVIETS HAD KEY ROLE IN PUSHING VOTE IN NICARAGUA, U.S. SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: THE KREMLIN PERSUADED MANAGUA TO ABIDE BY ACCORDS CALLING FOR 
ELECTION, OFFICIAL ASSERTS.

<P>
In the first concrete payoff in Latin America from warming U.S.-Soviet 
relations, Moscow played a key role in persuading Nicaraguan President Daniel 
Ortega to hold the election that swept him from office, a senior State 
Department official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The official, who briefed reporters on the understanding he would not be 
identified, said the Soviet Union pressed Ortega's government to abide by last 
year's Central American peace accords, which called for contested elections. 
</P>
<P>
The action came after the Bush Administration made it clear that Soviet 
behavior in Central America would have an important impact on overall relations 
between Washington and Moscow, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
Washington has been alternately pressuring and cajoling Moscow concerning 
Central America for the past year, he said, noting that Bernard Aronson, 
assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, made his first 
official trip to Moscow, not Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the Soviet Union played a constructive role in encouraging the 
Sandinista government to hold these elections and to hold a dialogue with the 
opposition," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
"In an unprecedented way, both sides (the United States and the Soviet Union) 
have been keeping their side of the bargain, which was, from the beginning, to 
use our respective influence with our respective friends in the region to try 
to press the Central American peace process forward," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that just three days before Sunday's election, the Soviet Foreign 
Ministry issued a statement pointedly calling attention to Sandinista promises 
to abide by the outcome of the election and to relinquish power if defeated. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets have substantial clout in Managua because Ortega has been heavily 
dependent on them for both economic and political support. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Ion Bourliai, deputy head of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's Latin 
American department, told a news conference that the Soviet Union is willing to 
continue its economic aid to the new Nicaraguan government to be headed by 
President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet Union said it would respect the results and today we are confirming 
this position of ours," Bourliai said. "Our relations in the trade and economic 
field are determined by corresponding agreements. The Soviet Union is prepared 
to meet its obligations in the future if the Nicaraguan side supports this 
position." 
</P>
<P>
Moscow has been providing about $333 million annually in economic aid to 
Nicaragua on a credit basis, plus 25 million tons of wheat and rice free of 
charge, Bourliai said. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the senior State Department official said he was "very 
encouraged" by Bourliai's pledge to respect the election results. As for the 
promise of continuing aid, the official said that was between Moscow and the 
Chamorro government. 
</P>
<P>
"The new government will need economic assistance badly," the official said. 
"The United States will not be able to meet all of their needs by any means." 
He said he assumes Chamorro "will accept aid from whatever source." 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the Administration is 
determined to help Nicaragua rebuild its shattered economy. But he gave no 
indication of the size of the U.S. assistance, nor did he suggest where the 
government would obtain the money. 
</P>
<P>
The senior State Department official said that no decision will be made 
concerning aid to Nicaragua until U.S. officials confer with Chamorro's chief 
economic adviser, Francisco Mayorga, who is scheduled to arrive in Washington 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We will develop an aid package for Nicaragua that will be significant and 
meaningful," Fitzwater said. "The democratic aspirations of the Nicaraguan 
people deserve our support and they will have it." 
</P>
<P>
However, other officials conceded that the election upset in Nicaragua, coming 
on the heels of the overthrow of Communist regimes in Eastern Europe and the 
ouster of dictator Manuel A. Noriega in Panama, will stretch the 
Administration's $15-billion foreign aid budget to the breaking point. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) said after a White House meeting with President Bush and 
other congressional leaders that the Administration should establish an 
"emergency democracy fund" to channel foreign aid to Nicaragua, Panama, and 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"You're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars" over a four-year to 
five-year period, Nunn said. "After all, we spent trillions and trillions of 
dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars, defending the free world waiting for 
this day, and now that we've arrived at this day, I think we should not be 
shortsighted in our approach." 
</P>
<P>
Nunn is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which will help shape 
the Pentagon's proposed $295-billion budget. But when asked if the democracy 
fund should come out of defense appropriations, he shrugged and did not answer. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. David Obey (D-Wis.), chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees the 
foreign aid program, said that money for increased aid to Eastern Europe and 
Panama must come from reduced Pentagon spending. However, the Administration 
has made it clear that it is reluctant to reduce military programs until it is 
convinced that the current diplomatic thaw continues.

The World Bank's board, including the United States, unanimously approved a 
$60-million rural development loan to China on Tuesday, the first of seven 
loans that were held back after last year's crackdown on pro-democracy 
demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
Bank President Barber B. Conable said the bank is now back to regular lending 
to China. 
</P>
<P>
The bank made another loan to China earlier this month for earthquake repair. 
</P>
<P>
The World Bank is the largest single source of aid to the Third World, lending 
over $21 billion a year, and China and India are its biggest borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
The loan approved Tuesday for farming in Jiangxi province will be repayable in 
40 years with less than 1% annual interest. 
</P>
<P>
After Conable held back the loans because of the crackdown last June, President 
Bush asked that lending be suspended. Since then the United States has resumed 
its own loans to China.

A man accused of murdering his ex-wife after she won $727,000 in the California 
Lottery has waived a jury trial and will allow a judge to decide the case. 
David Scott Harrison, 33, who already has been sentenced in federal court for a 
car bombing, arson and an insurance fraud scheme, is charged in the 
strangulation of Anne Jenkins, whose body was found in her San Marcos home in 
February, 1988. Prosecutors say that Harrison killed his ex-wife after he 
realized that with the state lottery winnings she could better finance her 
court battle against Harrison over child custody and visitation.

CORNELIUS GUNTER, COASTERS TENOR, SLAIN IN LAS VEGAS

Cornelius (Cornell) Gunter, lead tenor for the Coasters during the glory days 
of that Los Angeles-based doo-wop rock unit when they recorded such hits as 
"Yakety Yak" and "Charlie Brown," was shot to death while traveling through 
North Las Vegas, police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gunter, who worked regularly in the Nevada city leading an ensemble he called 
Cornell Gunter and the Coasters (as opposed to nearly a dozen other Coasters 
groups now touring the country), was found slumped over the steering wheel of 
his car Monday, Las Vegas Police Officer Darren Flatin said. Flatin said Gunter 
was in his 50s, but he did not know the singer's exact age. 
</P>
<P>
Gunter, who began with the Coasters in 1957, two years after the original group 
evolved from the L.A.-based Robins, was found about 11 a.m. at a street 
intersection with two gunshot wounds in his chest. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears he was shot through the windshield and he was dead on the scene. We 
don't have a motive at this time," Police Lt. Gary Rainey said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that Gunter's car was parked at a North Las Vegas intersection 
and a thin black man was standing on the driver's side, talking to him. 
</P>
<P>
"They apparently got into a loud argument," Rainey said. "People heard a couple 
of shots. Then the car took off, went about a block, then hit a block wall." 
</P>
<P>
Gunter and the Coasters were scheduled to perform at the Lady Luck Hotel this 
weekend, said Janice Mazuroski, assistant director of advertising and public 
relations at the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Gunter replaced tenor Young Jessie with the vocal team that became known for 
its comedy and for bringing the expression "Why is everybody always picking on 
me?" into the pop parlance of the day. The phrase, sung by bass Will (Dub) 
Jones, was from the Coasters' 1959 hit "Charlie Brown." 
</P>
<P>
Their first big hit had come two years earlier with "Searchin'," backed by 
another success, "Young Blood." 
</P>
<P>
The Coasters -- who took their name from their West Coast origins -- were 
formed when the Robins split into two groups. The original Coasters ensemble 
included Billy Guy, Carl Gardner, Leon Hughes and Bobby Nunn. Jessie replaced 
Hughes in 1956, and Gunter then subbed for Jessie the following year. 
</P>
<P>
With a flurry of other hits that included "Along Came Jones" and "Poison Ivy" 
in 1959, the Coasters were the country's most popular black rock 'n' roll group 
at the end of the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
Among their other hits were "Framed," "Idol With the Golden Head," and 
"Shoppin' for Clothes." The group managed substantial album sales but generally 
appealed to singles buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Gunter left the group in the early 1960s. The Coasters' last major hit was 
"Love Potion Number 9." 
</P>
<P>
With varying personnel, Gunter continued to keep the group in concert through 
the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Various other Coasters -- some original and some not -- have also headed 
separate groups in recent years, all billing themselves as Coasters. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, another member of one of those groups, Nathaniel (Buster) Wilson, was 
murdered in what a Las Vegas jury adjudged was a fraud coverup. 
</P>
<P>
Gunter was a Los Angeles native who had lived in Nevada most recently. In 1987, 
he was inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame.

HAYDEN TAKING A BEAD ON SWEATSHOPS; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: HE PLANS LEGISLATION TO MAKE GARMENT MAKERS MORE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
TREATMENT OF WORKERS. REGULATORS HAVE FOUND SOME BEING PAID AS LITTLE AS $1 AN 
HOUR. 
</P>

<P>
Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) plans to introduce legislation this 
week aimed at cleaning up sweatshops by making garment manufacturers more 
responsible for the treatment of workers who sew their clothing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a Dickens novel," Hayden said Tuesday of wage, hour, and child labor 
abuses that regulators have found in the garment industry in Los Angeles and 
Orange counties. "You have primitive, 19th-Century sweatshops underpinning an 
economy that is super-opulent, with the rich being in most cases completely 
unaware of the source of their clothes." 
</P>
<P>
Hayden, chairman of the Assembly Committee on Labor and Employment, said he 
would introduce his bill by Friday, the deadline for new legislation. But even 
as he began drumming up support for the bill, he warned that new laws would 
fail unless consumers and retailers begin applying conscience to their fashion 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
"If the people who care about animal rights would only add workers' rights to 
their immediate agenda, you'd have quite a movement going on the Westside (of 
Los Angeles)," Hayden said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with two garment trade groups said that the state should spend more 
money to enforce existing laws before passing new ones. 
</P>
<P>
The last round of garment industry reforms, passed in 1980, required sewing 
shop owners to register with the state and pass an exam covering state labor 
laws, said Joe Rodriguez, executive director of the Garment Contractors Assn. 
of Southern California. The licensing fees were to have been earmarked for 
enforcement, but have instead been siphoned off for general use by the state, 
Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Brown, president of the Coalition of Apparel Industries of California, 
said his group has supported a wide array of reform bills, but warned that 
over-regulation would doom the $6-billion-a-year Los Angeles apparel industry. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying, very desperately trying to clean up the act in our industry," 
Brown said. "(But) if indeed there's a liability act we can't live with, we'll 
just move out of California." 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, federal and state regulators have uncovered a nest of 
sweatshops paying workers as little as $1 an hour to sew clothing bound for 
Southern California's priciest department stores. 
</P>
<P>
Some officials and labor leaders say the problem with existing labor laws is 
that they make it relatively simple to fine sweatshop bosses, but nearly 
impossible to punish manufacturers who profit from the sweatshop system by 
having their clothing sewn at rock-bottom prices. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Labor in Santa Ana, which began a crackdown on Orange 
County sweatshops last summer, has tried to attack the problem with a dual 
approach: requiring sweatshop owners who underpaid workers to pay back wages, 
and using the 1938 "hot goods" law to prevent manufacturers from shipping 
across state lines clothing that was made in violation of federal labor law. 
</P>
<P>
Hayden's bill would take a similar approach on the state level by strengthening 
the "joint liability" provisions of state law. Currently, California law makes 
manufacturers liable for labor violations by their contractors only if the 
manufacturer knew of the abuses.

STATE HIGH COURT ASKED TO TAKE OVER PROP. 103 SUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP HAGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The sponsors of Proposition 103 asked the state Supreme Court on Tuesday to 
take immediate jurisdiction over 14 lawsuits and resolve a tangle of issues 
that threaten long delays in implementing the measure's auto insurance reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Voter Revolt filed a petition asking the high court to take the 
unusual step of direct intervention to thwart what they said is an attempt by 
the insurance industry to use the courts to defeat the aims of the 1988 
rate-cutting initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an outrage the way the judicial system is being manipulated," said Amy R. 
Bach, an attorney for the Center for Public Interest Law, which represents the 
group. "We're hoping the court will step in now." 
</P>
<P>
The bid by the backers of the initiative followed a similar request to the high 
court by Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie, who last week accused 
insurers of filing "nuisance lawsuits" to prevent the measure from taking full 
effect. Unless the high court intervenes, Gillespie said, there could be a 
"decade of litigation" over the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Both Voter Revolt and Gillespie urged the justices to deny an industry 
challenge to an order by the commissioner denying insurers a 112% increase in 
assigned-risk car insurance rates. 
</P>
<P>
The California Automobile Assigned Risk Plan, an association of companies that 
issue insurance to more than 1 million drivers who lack regular coverage, says 
the firms are losing $2 million each business day in the program. 
</P>
<P>
All auto insurers are required to accept a portion of drivers who cannot obtain 
regular insurance coverage. Each insurer is assigned a quota based on its share 
of the market. 
</P>
<P>
In its petition to the high court, Voter Revolt argued that countless good 
drivers are being "herded" into the assigned-risk program by the industry's 
refusal to offer them affordable regular policies. 
</P>
<P>
The organization accused insurers of doing "everything legal -- and illegal" to 
prevent the commissioner from using her wide new powers under the initiative to 
regulate and review industry pricing practices. 
</P>
<P>
Under the measure, insurance rates were to be reduced 20% below their November, 
1987, levels, but that provision, among others, has been delayed in court. 
</P>
<P>
In a wide range of cases filed throughout the state, insurers also have 
challenged a temporary freeze Gillespie imposed last fall on private passenger 
auto rates, as well as regulations she issued prohibiting the use of a driver's 
age, sex or place of residence in setting policy rates. 
</P>
<P>
If the justices agree to consolidate and hear the 14 cases currently pending in 
lower courts, it would mark the third time the landmark insurance measure has 
come before the state high court. 
</P>
<P>
Last May, the court upheld the constitutionality of the initiative but, in an 
important concession to the industry, held that insurers must be allowed a 
"fair rate of return" on their business. Just how that rate is to be calculated 
has been the subject of hearings before the commissioner that began last fall 
and only now are nearing a conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the high court held that insurers could refuse to renew policies 
and withdraw from California without first finding another firm to serve their 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
Bach, the lawyer for Voter Revolt, acknowledged that the high court -- in a 
move to clarify the complex issues at stake -- could order a state Court of 
Appeal to hear the cases as a prelude to high court review.

SOONER OR LATER, THE MIGHTY FALL IN OKLAHOMA

NORMAN, Okla.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The message from Oklahoma has come through loud and clear: The Big Eight has 
three of the best basketball teams in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma defeated No. 1 Kansas, 100-78, Tuesday, two days after a convincing 
victory over then-No. 1 Missouri on Sunday. It was the 45th consecutive victory 
for the Sooners, 22-4 overall and 10-3 Big Eight, at the Lloyd Noble Center. 
</P>
<P>
The victory also provided evidence for a national television audience that 
while Kansas and Missouri have drawn much of the attention this season, 
Oklahoma might have been equally deserving. 
</P>
<P>
"I've said that all along," Kansas coach Roy Williams said. "(Oklahoma) lost 
some tough games earlier, but they were on the road. It's a different story 
when you're playing at home." 
</P>
<P>
The Jayhawks (27-3, 10-3) found out in a painful manner. Oklahoma harassed the 
usually composed Jayhawks into 26 turnovers resulting in 37 points. The Sooners 
used a mix of full-court pressure and half-court zone traps that virtually 
paralyzed Kansas in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"We were totally clueless against their press," Jayhawk Jeff Gueldner said. 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 22-15, in the first half, the Sooners used their defensive pressure to 
trigger a 13-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
Skeeter Henry, who led the Sooners with 23 points, scored eight points during 
the spurt, including two dunks. Rick Calloway finally silenced the crowd with a 
10-foot jumper for Kansas, but the Sooners responded with a 6-0 run and led, 
41-17, with 5:13 to play in the half. 
</P>
<P>
In all, it was a stretch Williams seemed eager to forget. 
</P>
<P>
"We stunk handling the ball, we stunk passing the ball, we stunk catching the 
ball," Williams said. "We have to take better care of the basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked at times like a track meet to see how many times they could dunk the 
basketball. They just made us look silly at times." 
</P>
<P>
When the Jayhawks weren't turning the ball over, they were frustrated by poor 
shooting. Kansas made only 29 of 64 shots overall. 
</P>
<P>
The Sooners, meanwhile, successfully worked the ball inside to William Davis, 
who had 22 points, and shot from the perimeter, making 10 of 18 three-point 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried every defense we had," Williams said. "Needless to say, none of them 
worked." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, a 6-foot-6 senior, did not play in the first meeting between the teams 
for undisclosed reasons. But he responded this time by making eight of 13 shots 
and grabbing six rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"You bet we're a better team with Davis," Oklahoma Coach Billy Tubbs said. 
</P>
<P>
The Sooners also got a boost off the bench from freshman Terry Evans, who 
scored 22 points and had five assists and five steals. 
</P>
<P>
"He's beginning to get the confidence back he had earlier in the year," Tubbs 
said of Evans. "He did a great job of penetrating and dishing it off." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Pritchard led Kansas with 16 points.

CHANG FALLS IN STRAIGHT SETS IN COMEBACK 
</P>

<P>
No question, no debate, no doubt about it. No more medical data required. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Chang is coming back too soon. 
</P>
<P>
He should arrive at his Placentia home some time this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
For the sullen promoters of the Volvo Tennis/Indoor tournament here, that's 
about four rounds too soon. Amid a faceless sea of Chris Garners, Gilad Blooms 
and Bruno Oresars, Chang was one name sure to bring the local folks out. He and 
Stefan Edberg were the gate attractions, lured by huge guarantees to grace this 
land this week. 
</P>
<P>
But after sitting out 90 days since his last singles match, Chang barely lasted 
90 minutes in this, his official return to the men's tour. Chang went out in 
straight sets Tuesday night, losing, 6-4, 6-4, to Glenn Layendecker, the 
world's 63rd-ranked player noted mainly for a big serve and the big brace on 
his right leg. 
</P>
<P>
If you didn't know better, you'd have pegged the wrong player-on-the-comeback 
during warmups. While Chang bounced spritely along the baseline, Layendecker, 
who had knee surgery in 1986, looked like something out of Black &amp; Decker, 
lurching around the court with a mammoth black fiberglass brace covering his 
leg from upper thigh to lower calf. 
</P>
<P>
Chang, recovering from a fractured left hip, appeared fit and in shape and 
carrying a few more badly needed pounds, the result of regimented weight 
training during his three-month layoff. 
</P>
<P>
Chang simply looked great. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the match began. 
</P>
<P>
Balls that Chang would usually run down bounded past him, untouched. Forehands 
that would normally nick the line flared out of bounds. Serves typically 
scooped up and returned deep now left Chang handcuffed and off balance. 
</P>
<P>
Layendecker aced Chang 10 times. 
</P>
<P>
Chang double-faulted four times. 
</P>
<P>
Layendecker broke Chang's serve three times. 
</P>
<P>
Worse yet, Chang had Layendecker down, 3-0, and 0-40 in the fourth game of the 
second set -- only to let that game, along with the next five, get away. 
</P>
<P>
"He was vulnerable," Layendecker said. "His confidence was down. I think it had 
to be, this being his first match back after three months. . . . He wasn't 
sharp." 
</P>
<P>
Chang couldn't argue. 
</P>
<P>
"The mental part of my game was missing a little bit," he said. "I think by 
being out so long and not playing tournament matches, the mental side wasn't 
quite there. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I played OK. I was getting to most of the balls and was able to run 
down some shots. It's just a matter of needing to play a few more matches. What 
can you say?" 
</P>
<P>
Chang said the hip, which still hurt him as recently as last week, didn't 
bother him during the match. How about afterward? During the loser's press 
conference, Chang was asked if he felt any post-match ache. 
</P>
<P>
"Only here," he replied, tapping his chest. 
</P>
<P>
Chang said his greatest trouble came when trying to deal with Layendecker's 
serve. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen Glenn serve that big before," Chang said. "I had someone kind 
of scout on him last night, and I was told most of his big serves tended to go 
to the outside. Tonight, though, he hit the middle really well. He adjusted 
well." 
</P>
<P>
Chang's scout was his father, Joe, who had an inkling things could turn ugly 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"When I watched him the other night, he had four aces in his first service 
game," Joe said. "Four aces. 
</P>
<P>
"I came back and said, 'Michael, he's serving out of his mind.' " 
</P>
<P>
No finesse player, and certainly no runner, Layendecker is a one-dimensional 
grinder, the type of opponent Chang normally slices and dices. 
</P>
<P>
But on this night, the rank-and-file rose to more than equal terms with rusted 
royalty.

Cable television magnate Ted Turner says he expects to lose $10 million 
broadcasting the Goodwill Games in Seattle from July 20-Aug. 5. But he isn't 
worried. 
</P>
<P>
"Sports are a loss leader to bring you into the (international) network," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We will lose less than ABC did on the Winter Olympics and NBC did on the 
Summer Games. In a world where the network that loses the least is the most 
successful, we must be considered the most successful."

Trivia time: Name the four baseball players who have gone through every major 
league lockout and strike. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody's fool: Ralph Sampson, the Sacramento King center who has three years 
and $8 million left on his contract, was asked about rumors that he will 
negotiate a buyout. 
</P>
<P>
"They can buy me out any time they want," Sampson said. "But I don't want a 
pile of dirt from out behind Arco Arena. I want cash money. I graduated on time 
with my class at Virginia, and I learned a couple of things there." 
</P>
<P>
A fast lane no more: The Lakers' Magic Johnson, on lower scores in the NBA this 
season: "Detroit won (the 1988-89 title) because of defense, and once somebody 
wins using a style, everyone wants to use that style. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't run free through the lane. The last couple of years, you find you'll 
be body-checked when you do that. Bodies are bigger now." 
</P>
<P>
Not tough enough: Larry Bird, on the inconsistency of the Boston Celtics: "One 
thing we've always been pretty famous for is taking advantage of mismatches, 
not letting any breakdown last too long. Now, when we have breakdowns, it seems 
like everybody goes along with it, everybody on the team, and it's been 
disastrous for us. 
</P>
<P>
"We show signs of being a great basketball team and then the next night we 
don't look good at all. We've got to be mentally tougher." 
</P>
<P>
Riding the carousel: Pat Williams, general manager of the Orlando Magic, on the 
reported five-year, $27.5-million contract recently awarded to NBA Commissioner 
David Stern: "All I know is that on airplane trips, David's wallet will be 
considered carry-on baggage." 
</P>
<P>
Crystal basketball: Art Hyland, Big East Conference supervisor of officials, 
would like to see a more stringent penalty than a one-and-one for fouling in 
the waning minutes of a game. "Make any foul in the last two minutes a two-shot 
foul," he says. "Or make it two shots plus the ball. The officials can't be 
expected to look into a kid's mind and know his intention." 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rose watch: The former manager of the Cincinnati Reds, playing golf daily 
in Plant City, Fla., says: "I shot 118 last September. I'm high 80s now. You 
hit as many balls as I do, your scores got to come down eventually."

PRO BASKETBALL: LOS ANGELES' LOSING STREAK ENDS AT SEVEN WITH A 103-99 VICTORY

Forward Charles Smith of the Clippers let out a sigh of relief after the 
Clippers' losing streak ended at seven games with a 103-99 victory over the 
Seattle SuperSonics Tuesday night at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Smith scored 23 points as the Clippers won their first game since Feb. 8, when 
they defeated the Washington Bullets, 105-103. 
</P>
<P>
"It was tough to break out of the losing streak with all the various things 
going on as far as different players coming in and out of here and all the 
transition we made," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers (22-33), who exceeded their victory total for last season, looked 
strong in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
After a dismal first half during which they fell behind by as many as 16 
points, the Clippers made 12 of 14 shots and outscored Seattle, 31-21, in the 
third quarter to get back into the game. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good to get this streak broken," Clipper Coach Don Casey said. "In the 
second half the team rose to the occasion." 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied at 95, center Benoit Benjamin made a free throw with 3:41 
left and, after a steal by guard Tom Garrick, set up Danny Manning for a layup 
with a nice pass. The Clippers kept the lead. 
</P>
<P>
"Ben played well at a time when we needed it most," Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Winston Garland helped to key the comeback, scoring six of his 16 points 
in the final quarter. Leading 101-97, Garland made two free throws with 7.7 
seconds left to seal the win. 
</P>
<P>
Garland also did a good job of playing defense on Seattle guard Dana Barros, 
who had a career-high 26 points, limiting him to seven points in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever you stop someone or shut them down, you cannot credit one guy," 
Garland said. "It's the whole team that helps you out defensively. 
</P>
<P>
The game marked the return of guard Quintin Dailey, who played for the Clippers 
from 1986 until last season. 
</P>
<P>
Does Dailey hold a a grudge against the Clippers, who failed to pick up his 
option after last season? 
</P>
<P>
"Why should I?" Dailey said. . "It's over. I'm trying to stay with this team. 
I'm not going to make it a big thing." 
</P>
<P>
Averaging 12.2 points since he was signed by Seattle, Dailey scored 21 points 
off the bench, including 15 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"Quintin has been playing exceptionally well," said SuperSonic forward Michael 
Cage, a former Clipper. "He came in and made an impact right away. He adds an 
element that has been missing from our team, crunch scoring." 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers signed guard Steve Harris to a 10-day contract. Harris replaces 
Jim Les, who was waived on Monday. Harris, 6 feet 5, averaged 25.5 points for 
the Columbus Horizon of the Continental Basketball Assn. this season. The 
Houston Rockets' first round draft pick in 1985, Harris has played for the 
Rockets, Golden State Warriors and Detroit Pistons. "I'm just going to come and 
work hard and help the Clippers in any way I can," Harris said. . . . With the 
addition of Harris, will Ken Norman be able to move back to small forward, his 
natural position? "That's not the underlying plan," said Coach Don Casey. . . . 
Clipper guard Gary Grant, who broke his left ankle on Feb. 2., said he's making 
progress. "It feels like I can go right now, but I know I can't," Grant said.

TENNIS WOMEN'S TOURNAMENT AT INDIAN WELLS; 
</P>
<P>
NAVRATILOVA DOESN'T WASTE HER TIME IN THE SUN, DEFEATS PROVIS, 6-2, 6-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

INDIAN WELLS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a week in Chicago and a week in Washington, Martina Navratilova's tour of 
America arrived in the Coachella Valley Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The result was predictable. Navratilova was tired, Navratilova was hot, 
Navratilova was off the court after 49 minutes of a sizzling 6-2, 6-0 victory 
over Nicole Provis in the Virginia Slims of Indian Wells. 
</P>
<P>
So, what was the rush? 
</P>
<P>
"I like to work on my suntan, but I'd rather do it by the pool and not on the 
court," Navratilova said. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't take her long to hit the lounge chair. She served three aces to win 
the fourth game and level the first set, 2-2, then won the next four games and 
closed out the set with a drop-dead half-volley. 
</P>
<P>
From then on, she could probably smell the suntan lotion. After Navratilova's 
fifth ace, it was 4-0. Provis held a 40-15 lead but lost the fifth game when 
Navratilova hit a cross-court backhand volley and the ball stopped as if it had 
lost its compression. 
</P>
<P>
Provis, ranked No. 72, could do nothing to hurt the second-ranked and 
top-seeded Navratilova, who lost only 10 points on her serve. 
</P>
<P>
"She's obviously in great form," the Australian said. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova said she has never played any better, pointing to her revamped 
service motion as an example. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hitting over my backhand more now, and my serve is a lot more solid, 
simple and fluid," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned that she was using her arm too much, Navratilova changed her serve to 
employ legs, shoulders and stomach in her motion. She also reverted to her 
natural, rocking movement to get into her serve, which she had been starting 
from a motionless position. 
</P>
<P>
As smooth as Navratilova's second-round victory was, it could not equal 
fourth-seeded Jana Novotna's 6-0, 6-0 rout of qualifier Yukie Koizumi. 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Conchita Martinez, who has decided to take up golf for 
recreation, was up to par in her second-round victory over Cammy MacGregor. 
Martinez needed 53 minutes to win, 6-1, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Martinez said she has been spending some time on the driving range. 
"It relaxes me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Tennis did nothing to relax third-seeded Helena Sukova, who was playing her 
first match since the semifinals of the Australian Open and looked like it. 
</P>
<P>
Monique Javer, ranked No. 99 and a dual citizen of Great Britain and the United 
States, was doubly tough on Sukova, who pulled out a 4-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-0 
victory and was then asked if she felt she had gotten her rough match out of 
the way early. 
</P>
<P>
"Who knows if the next one will be more difficult?" Sukova said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. Sukova made a difficult decision recently, parting with Coach Lada 
Travnicek. She is now coached by her Czech boyfriend, former motocross racer 
and gymnast Jaromir Jirik, and her ranking has gone from No. 5 to No. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
Martina Navratilova's postmatch news conference was as routine as her match 
until she was asked if she felt more Czech than American because of the events 
in her native Czechoslovakia. "Look, I've lived here since '75 and I've been a 
citizen since '81," Navratilova said, her voice rising. "Darn right, I find 
that question insulting. The only real Americans are the Indians -- not even 
the people who came over on the Mayfair or whatever. I'm a citizen. What am I 
-- chopped liver? I chose to live here. I could not choose where I was born, 
but I could choose where I live." . . . Seventh-seeded Larisa Savchenko was 
upset by Etsuko Inoue, 6-4, 6-1.

STATE TAKING FLYER ON PIRU; 
</P>
<P>
A 1.3-MILE SECTION OF THE CREEK WILL BECOME WILD TROUT FISHERY THURSDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This might come as news to the trout in the upper reaches of Piru Creek, but 
after today it's no more worms, no more salmon eggs, no more Power Bait. 
</P>
<P>
That's it, fellas. From now on it's a steady diet of artificial flies and lures 
-- yecchhh! -- but here's the good news: no barbed hooks, and even if you are 
caught by fishermen, they'll have to throw you back. 
</P>
<P>
With the revised, 1990 state fishing regulations becoming effective Thursday, 
there will be a statewide limit of five trout per day, 10 in possession, and 
the top 1.3 miles of Piru Creek below the Pyramid Lake dam will join Sespe 
Creek, Deep Creek, Bear Creek and the West Fork of the San Gabriel River as the 
only Southern California streams to be managed as wild trout fisheries. That 
means no more fish plants and, for Piru, a zero limit. 
</P>
<P>
Some bait fishermen might have to adjust, but fly fishermen are delighted -- 
particularly the Sierra Pacific Flyfishers of the San Fernando Valley for whom 
the designation comes as the culmination of a long campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the closest stream to our club's area, so we sort of adopted it," said 
club President Duwayne Chebul, an Inglewood police detective. 
</P>
<P>
The club's proprietary attitude about Piru is understandable. The members have 
not only fished it but cared for it, periodically organizing weekend work 
parties to pick up trash, build trails down the steep banks, install concrete 
pads for trash cans and manage the trees and brush. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Piru will be the state's first roadside wild trout stream, which 
isn't necessarily good. The old Highway 99, replaced by Interstate 5 26 years 
ago, runs alongside from the Frenchman's Flat undeveloped campground to Pyramid 
Dam. The stream is only 45 miles from downtown Los Angeles, accessible via the 
Templin Highway turnoff from I-5 north of Castaic, and an abundance of litter 
is evidence that it attracts heavy use for many outdoor activities. 
</P>
<P>
"This doesn't have to be the exclusive property of the Sierra Pacific Fly 
Fishers or fly fishermen in general," Chebul said. "But I think you'll find 
that fly fishermen tend to be conservationists." 
</P>
<P>
CalTrans, considering maintenance costs, is thinking about placing a chain 
across the abandoned road that would force anglers to walk a mile or more to 
the wild trout stretch. The fly fishermen would welcome the chain. They figure 
they would be able to spend more time fishing and less time picking up after 
other users who don't regard Piru with the same reverence. 
</P>
<P>
George Chapman, a retired Navy commander who spearheaded the campaign, 
organized last weekend's project to tidy up Piru for its wild trout debut. 
</P>
<P>
"We fishermen do not mind walking a mile or two," Chapman said. "The picnickers 
and others who leave their trash are looking for something close to the road." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Wickman, district ranger for the U.S. Forest Service, said: "There is a 
segment of the public that feels they have to drive right down to the stream -- 
or in it. It would enhance that wild trout area if they couldn't drive all the 
way there." 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Fish and Game ceased planting most of the wild trout stretch 
a couple of years ago as it studied Piru for possible designation. The new 
regulations extend the zone another half-mile down to a 10-foot waterfall 
created by a broken-down concrete culvert, which is decorated with graffiti. 
Below that, for another 1.3 miles down to Frenchman's Flat and beyond, bait 
will still be permitted, and the DFG will continue to plant 17,000 trout 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose is to create and preserve a higher-quality fishery with bigger, 
smarter fish, without shortchanging bait fishermen. The falls form a natural 
separation. The wild trout will be able to wander downstream, but the more 
easily caught lot from the hatchery can't go uptown to mingle with the wild 
bunch. 
</P>
<P>
By the nature of their regulations, wild trout streams are for fly fishermen, 
who observe the catch-and-release ethic like a religion and reserve their 
contempt for Power Bait. Or litterbugs. 
</P>
<P>
But an angler can't have it both ways. Unlike artificial lures or flies, fish 
tend to swallow the hook with edible bait, sealing their own doom. 
</P>
<P>
John Deinstadt, associate fishery biologist for the DFG in charge of the wild 
trout program, said: "It isn't our mission to establish fisheries for fly 
fishermen. If bait angling would work, I'd be very much in favor of it." 
</P>
<P>
Deinstadt's figures show that fish hooked on bait have a mortality rate in 
excess of 50%, those taken on artificial flies and lures only 3% to 5%. 
</P>
<P>
Fly angling takes some practice but, Deinstadt said, "Almost anyone can handle 
a lure. We are establishing an area for anyone who enjoys the challenge of wild 
trout fishing and is willing to use gear which allows them to quickly release 
the trout they land back into the creek." 
</P>
<P>
The plan, he said, is "to displace as few 'catchable' anglers as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Halliwell of Tujunga, fishing Piru with 9-year-old Jerrod Macpherson on 
Saturday, didn't know he was about to be displaced. His favorite fishing hole 
is a large pool at the head of the new wild trout area. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a nice, quiet place," Halliwell said. 
</P>
<P>
The fishing was so good, Halliwell said, that "I'm trying to teach the kid 
patience, but he gets a bite every time he throws the bait out." 
</P>
<P>
They were using red salmon eggs. Told that the new regulations were to go into 
effect Thursday, Halliwell noted: "That's my birthday. Bureaucracy in action. 
They seem to regulate the things you enjoy the most." 
</P>
<P>
Halliwell didn't think he would become a fly angler. 
</P>
<P>
"I've tried," he said. "Can't get the hang of it. I usually throw 'em back, 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Pacific Flyfishers were organized in 1973, and a few years ago when 
the DFG was mandated to add 25 miles of stream and two lakes to its wild trout 
program every year, the Flyfishers started thumping for Piru Creek. 
</P>
<P>
"We were politically naive," Chapman said. 
</P>
<P>
But with the help of CalTrout's regional director, Jim Edmondson, they learned. 
Chapman wrote letters and circulated petitions. The DFG took surveys -- one 
showing that Piru held about one fish per linear foot, most only 3 to 6 inches 
but some up to 14 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Another survey showed that from August of 1988 through July of '89, Piru -- a 
year-round fishery -- was subjected to 56,344 angling hours and yielded 66,054 
trout, of which 46,634 were released. Bait anglers released 57% of their 
catches, fly anglers 97%. 
</P>
<P>
The conclusions were that Piru had the potential to become a premier trout 
stream, but the fish would need a chance to grow -- thus, a zero limit. 
</P>
<P>
Deinstadt thinks it can rival Hot Creek, the premier Eastern Sierra wild trout 
fishery. "It will not be a Hot Creek in terms of the size of trout or the 
splendid setting, but it should equal Hot Creek in terms of total trout landed 
(per) mile of stream." 
</P>
<P>
The stream's future seems assured by a guaranteed flow through the California 
Aqueduct system. Most of the water from Pyramid is passed to Castaic Lake, but 
Piru Creek has a steady flow, recommended by the DFG and mandated by the State 
Department of Water Resources' permit from the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Even without that guarantee, Chapman said, he would be willing to make 
sacrifices. "I'd give up my green grass in Los Angeles for a trout stream," he 
said.

44TH WESTERN FISHING TACKLE AND BOAT SHOW STARTS AT LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By RICH ROBERTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
If it's true that God does not subtract time spent fishing, Fred Hall should 
live forever. 
</P>
<P>
Hall's life has been dedicated to all forms of the sport, which he brings to 
the public again as the producer of the 44th Western Fishing Tackle and Boat 
Show at the Long Beach Convention Center today through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
His policy has always been to admit children under 12 free, if they're with a 
parent, and to let them fish free at the show's trout tank. Hall estimates that 
he has introduced 600,000 kids from three generations to fishing. 
</P>
<P>
The show claims to have "the world's largest supply of fishing tackle," plus 
booths for resorts and displays of boats up to 48 feet. Show hours are 3-10 
p.m. today through Friday, 11 a.m.-10:30 p.m. Saturday and 11 a.m.-7 p.m. 
Sunday. Admission is $6.50. 
</P>
<P>
People on the Upper Kern River who rely on the fishing trade were supportive 
when the Department of Fish and Game proposed changing a stretch above the 
Johnsondale Bridge to wild trout status this year. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't fight that at all," said John T. (Jack) Dempsey, who runs Sierra 
Sporting Goods in Kernville. "Then they dropped the bomb on us." 
</P>
<P>
Dempsey and his neighbors read in a newspaper that the new state fishing 
regulations effective Thursday also would close the heart of the Upper Kern 
from Lake Isabella to the Tulare-Kern County Line to year-round, winter 
fishing, "to protect the resource." 
</P>
<P>
But it wouldn't do much for business, said Dempsey, who estimated that a 
two-month shutdown starting Thursday, until the general trout season opens 
April 28, would cost merchants in the area 70% of their normal trade. 
</P>
<P>
"March and April are going to be devastating," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fishing also will be less fun, Dempsey said, because it's only in the winter 
months that the anglers have the river to themselves, without sharing it with 
rafters, kayakers and swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
And furthermore, Dempsey added, it isn't fair that "the price of a (fishing) 
license has increased by $1.75 to $21, but the season has been reduced to six 
months." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently there will be no closure. Dempsey organized an appeal with 45 
letters of protest and collected 619 signatures on petitions. Ron Pelzman of 
the Fish and Game Commission staff said Tuesday that special action was taken 
to review the change, and an announcement is expected today that it will be 
fishing as usual on the Kern, year-round. 
</P>
<P>
"There was never an intent to close that winter fishery down," Pelzman said, 
indicating that it was just a mixup when the regulations were completely redone 
for simplification this year. The Kern was "inadvertently" grouped with the 
seasonal streams. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly 
</P>
<P>
The six-man Transantarctica Expedition, having logged 3,800 miles, is expected 
to complete its seven-month trek with sled dogs Saturday at Mirnyy, a Soviet 
base. ABC plans to televise the arrival during "Wide World of Sports.". . . 
Trout Unlimited's South Coast Chapter conservation banquet on March 10 at the 
Balboa Bay Club is open to the public. Tickets are $40, and memberships will be 
on sale for half-price at $10. All profits go directly to conservation 
projects. Details: (714) 724-8840. . . . The Society for the Conservation of 
Bighorn Sheep and the Department of Fish and Game are seeking volunteers for a 
census project in the Lytle Creek area March 10-11. Details: (213) 256-0463. 
</P>
<P>
The take of abalone will be reduced when the season opens Thursday because of 
declining abalone stocks in several areas off the Southern California coast. 
The daily bag limit will be two a day in any combination of the species. The 
size limit will remain unchanged. The mainland coast from Palos Verdes to Dana 
Point is closed to the take of abalone. . . . The DFG will commission a new 
marine patrol boat, "Tuna," Thursday at Shelter Island in San Diego. . . . 
Fishing instruction will be given by author-guide Ron Kovach: Trout Fishing in 
California, at Fullerton Community College, March 5 and 7, 7-10 p.m. Fee is

NORTHRIDGE GETS GOOD MILEAGE FROM LONG DRIVES, 7-6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Were it not for the bright red jersey with his name and number printed on the 
back, Jody Garcia could have been mistaken for a statue. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, the left fielder for the Chapman College baseball team, spent much of 
Tuesday's game against Cal State Northridge with his hands frozen upon his 
knees -- movement being unnecessary as four Matador home runs sailed over his 
head, and the fence, at Hart Park in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Sharts provided two of the blasts and Mike Solar and Denny Vigo added one 
each as the Matadors powered past Chapman, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge improved to 9-6 overall, 4-1 in California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
play. Chapman is 8-7, 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I did back in high school," said Sharts, who set a Southern 
Section record with 32 homers at Simi Valley. "It's going my way and I like 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Sharts' first home run came in the fourth inning. The solo shot off starter 
Dave Paveloff was his eighth home run of season and gave the Matadors a 1-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge was behind, 4-3, in the eighth when Sharts blasted a three-run shot 
off Paveloff (3-3). 
</P>
<P>
"I thought they were going to bring a new guy in or do something like put me 
on," Sharts said. "I really didn't expect to get anything in the zone, but he 
hung a slider." 
</P>
<P>
Vigo, the next batter, chased Paveloff with another homer, his sixth. It proved 
to be the game-winner because Chapman rallied for two runs. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore right-hander Craig Clayton allowed four runs and 10 hits in seven 
innings to earn the victory and improve his record to 4-1. Clayton also struck 
out seven and walked only one. 
</P>
<P>
Vale Lopez stalled a two-run Chapman rally in the ninth to earn his first save. 
</P>
<P>
After Sharts' first homer, Chapman tied the score in the home half of the 
fourth on a single by Doug Yates that scored Tom Allison from third. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge went ahead, 3-1, on Solar's first home run, a two-run shot in the 
fifth that drove in Kyle Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman regained the lead with a three-run seventh that was keyed by Garcia's 
two-run triple to the right-field corner. 
</P>
<P>
That set the stage for the Matadors' rally in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Johnson started it with one-out double, Clayton kept it going by reaching 
first on an error and Sharts and Vigo finished it with their back-to-back 
homers. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman added two runs in the ninth on a run-scoring double by Allison and a 
wild pitch by Lopez.

MASTERS MAKES EARLY EXIT FROM THE PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The zone press had been the trademark of The Master's College men's basketball 
team all season. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs had used it to wear down the opposition and win close games all 
season. 
</P>
<P>
But Tuesday night, Master's was the victim of a full-court press that matched 
its own in tenacity and aggressiveness, and the result was a 97-86 loss to 
Southern California College in an NAIA District 3 playoff game in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The inexperience of the Mustangs, who were making their first District 3 
postseason appearance with a starting lineup that included a junior and four 
sophomores, was obvious. Master's committed 22 turnovers -- 14 in the first 
half when the Vanguards forged a 47-40 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to give them credit," Master's Coach Mel Hankinson said. "They 
played very well. But many of the turnovers were unforced. We would have guys 
open, but then throw it off a guy's feet. . . . That was our greenness 
showing." 
</P>
<P>
No one on Master's looked greener than point guard Damon Greer, the former 
Cleveland High standout who transferred from San Jose State last season. 
</P>
<P>
Greer, who entered the game averaging 9.1 points a game, missed his first 12 
shots and finished one of 13 for five points. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, your money players try to take over games like this and that's what 
happened tonight," Hankinson said. "But I don't think Damon is quite ready to 
do that yet." 
</P>
<P>
Greer's lack of offense was not the only factor in the Vanguards' win, however. 
Southern California was superb from long range, hitting nine of 15 three-point 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Scruggs, a 6-foot-2 senior guard from Huntsville, Ala., was four of six 
from three-point range and scored a game-high 33 points. 
</P>
<P>
Teammates Rick Witmer, Jeff Bickmore and John Mounce added 19, 18 and 16 
points, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Although Master's trailed for most of the game, the Mustangs tied the score on 
three occasions in the second half, but each time Southern California repelled 
the charge. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Newton's basket tied the score, 64-64, with 11 minutes 35 seconds left, 
but the Vanguards answered with a 9-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Webster (a team-high 19 points for Master's) was one of three Mustangs to 
foul out.

LOS ALAMITOS; 
</P>
<P>
ELDER KUEBLERS HAVE PAIR OF HEROES AT THE TRACK IN SONS RICK AND FRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SCHULEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pictures of harness horses and clippings of their exploits line the walls of My 
Hero submarine sandwich shop in Northridge, where, for the last 26 years, 
owners Howard and Elise Kuebler have satisfied customers with some of the best 
heroes in the San Ferando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But after sundown, the Kueblers' heroes are sons Rick and Fred. Rick, 36, is 
the leading driver at the Los Alamitos harness meeting with 68 victories. Fred, 
40, is the director of racing and co-racing secretary. 
</P>
<P>
"We drive 60 miles each way every night that Los Alamitos is racing," said 
Elise. "We are fans. Before Rick had his license, we flew to Sacramento to 
watch him in qualifiers. Needless to say, we are very proud of our young men." 
</P>
<P>
The Kueblers are as all-American a family as the Cleavers or the Nelsons. 
Howard is an Indiana native whose high school basketball team once beat a team 
coached by John Wooden. Elise's father was the musical director of Fox Films 
and did the background music for the original "State Fair." 
</P>
<P>
Howard and Elise met in California when he was completing a four-year hitch 
with the Marines. They moved to Jackson Heights in New York and became harness 
racing fans at Roosevelt and Yonkers raceways. 
</P>
<P>
"They used to show the races on TV," recalled Elise. "When Fred and Rick were 
little, they used to watch with their sister Tina and bet on the races." 
</P>
<P>
When Tina, now Tina Fitzpatrick, came down with rheumatic fever as a child, the 
Kueblers decided to return to the warmer climate of Southern California in 
1960. They settled three blocks from the sandwich shop they were to buy in 
1964. 
</P>
<P>
Fred and Rick played on Western Boys Baseball Assn. teams coached by their 
father. One of Fred's teammates was Doug DeCinces. At 12, Rick played shortstop 
on a national championship team. 
</P>
<P>
"We won the whole kit and caboodle," smiled Rick. "After the championship, we 
were taken to Dodger Stadium and introduced individually at home plate. I still 
have a baseball signed by the whole team, including Walter Alston and Sandy 
Koufax." 
</P>
<P>
Rick and Fred attended Allemany High School. Each day, they passed Devonshire 
Downs, a training facility that is now part of Cal State Northridge. Soon, they 
began mucking out stalls. 
</P>
<P>
"Rick was the one hell-bent for leather to do it," said Fred. "I went over as a 
form of protection. The big prize at the end of the rainbow was when we got a 
chance to jog (the horses) instead of wash and clean them." 
</P>
<P>
Fred, whose forte always has been business and management, graduated from Cal 
State Northridge with a degree in accounting and business administration. Rick 
attended college for a year before heeding the call of hoofbeats. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1971, Rick and I went to Sacramento as grooms for Marc Grenier and lived in 
tack rooms the whole summer," said Fred. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, Rick drove his first winner, a pacer named Alex Wejover, at 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave the horse a kiss in the winner's circle," said Rick. "It was a dream 
come true." 
</P>
<P>
A major turning point in the lives of the Kuebler family was the formation of 
My Hero Racing Stable in 1975. Fred masterminded the 10-share, $150,000 limited 
partnership, comprising the Kueblers, relatives and one close friend. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the funds were used at a Lexington (Ky.) sale, at which My Hero bought 
four 2-year-old fillies. None of them turned out very successful on the track 
but one, Kelly's Filly, developed into a gold mine as a broodmare. She was bred 
to Albatross and produced The Thilly Thavage and Thither Thavage. Her next foal 
was The Thilly Brudder, by Native Vic. 
</P>
<P>
All became as hard to beat as to pronounce. Fred, the bane of announcers, 
pleaded guilty to the naming. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of a joke," said Fred. " 'You thilly thavage' was a phrase heard 
at the time. I thought it would tongue-tie announcers, and people would 
remember the names." 
</P>
<P>
With the success of Kelly's Filly, My Hero stable grew quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"We got up to 35 horses, and each one sort of bought the other," said Elise. 
"We were very lucky." 
</P>
<P>
The My Hero horses were sold during the 1980s, though, when the sport hit hard 
times in California. 
</P>
<P>
Rick spent a winter at the Meadowlands in New Jersey and summers at Pocono 
Downs in Pennsylvania and Monticello Raceway in New York in the late 1970s 
before settling in California year-round. 
</P>
<P>
Fred began his career in race track management under Lloyd Arnold in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked him into a liaison position between race track and management," Fred 
said. "Within two or three months, the position grew to director of racing at 
Sacramento. We've had great bonding since the first day and took to each 
other's style." 
</P>
<P>
Fred remained with Arnold through 1983 and rejoined him when he bought Los 
Alamitos last year. 
</P>
<P>
Fred's schedule consists of management meetings during the day, drawing the 
races with co-secretary Ron Goldman at 4 p.m., and spending the evening in an 
unpretentiously furnished room overlooking the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
"Central headquarters" consists of a wall lined with seven television monitors 
of mutuel lines, a computerized typewriter producing mutuel information, a 
diagram of track lights and a telephone that rarely stops ringing. 
</P>
<P>
"There's lots of flack," said Fred. "It's not a job for someone with thin 
skin." 
</P>
<P>
Rick has concentrated on catch-driving since 1980, enabling him to drive solely 
for other trainers and not worry about morning training. 
</P>
<P>
"There's definitely a trend in that direction in this world of specialization," 
he said. "These guys who (work) day and night are iron." 
</P>
<P>
Rick drives primarily for Paul Blumenfeld, a former assistant. 
</P>
<P>
Rick started the week with 1,973 wins and should reach the 2,000 plateau before 
the end of the meet in April. 
</P>
<P>
"I owe everything to my biggest fans, my parents," he said. "They got us 
started. They put up the capital for a couple of guys who didn't know what they 
were doing." 
</P>
<P>
Harness Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Western Standardbred Assn.'s 1989 horse-of-the-year award will be presented 
after the eighth race Saturday. Candidates are divisional champions Denali's 
Thor, Lepton, Calvery Officer, Gee Gee Gem, Sam Stein, Winning Night, Doodlin, 
Anatolian Story, Capuchine, Moscato Beach, Sovereign Mine, Thadrow, Court of

</P>
<P>
French Heritage has been retired for breeding. The 8-year-old mare was vanned 
off the track after the $10,000 invitational pace for fillies and mares Friday. 
She suffered a broken pastern bone inn her left foreleg between the foot and 
ankle. She had a 1:57 mark and earnings of $143,897. 
</P>
<P>
Driver Steve Hyman was fined $100 for "unreasonable use of the whip" after 
pacer Armaway returned with cuts after the eighth race Feb. 21. Hyman also was 
put on probation for the rest of the year. "If it happens again, he will drive 
without a whip," said steward Peter Tommila. Driver Joe Anderson was fined $300 
for kicking Alboretto in the 11th race Feb. 10, his third offense.

HIGH SCHOOL SWIMMING PREVIEW;

<P>
HARVARD AIMS FOR HIGH-WATER MARK IN 2-A DIVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Let's play word association. 
</P>
<P>
It's easy. Just blurt out the sport you immediately associate with the high 
school mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
How about Canyon? 
</P>
<P>
Football. Good. Harry Welch would be proud. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland? 
</P>
<P>
Basketball. Nice. Somewhere, Trevor Wilson is smiling. 
</P>
<P>
How about Chatsworth? 
</P>
<P>
Baseball. There you go. A healthy response. 
</P>
<P>
A little tougher now. How about Harvard? 
</P>
<P>
Water polo? Good guess, but the Saracens -- especially Coach Rich Corso -- 
would like to see the response broaden a bit to include the swimming program 
that Corso quietly has built into a Southern Section 2-A Division power. 
</P>
<P>
"We're definitely the underdog," the fourth-year coach said. "But we've got a 
shot at winning the 2-A title." 
</P>
<P>
Big words for a school whose best finish in Southern Section history was a 
second-place performance in 1954 ("I did my homework," Corso confessed.) 
</P>
<P>
Harvard boasts great depth this season -- an important factor in the Southern 
Section championships, in which the top 12 finishers in an event score. 
</P>
<P>
"Other teams have the fastest swimmers (in the area)," Agoura Coach Mike 
Mulligan said. "But (Harvard) has great depth. A lot of strong, fast swimmers. 
A lot of good bodies." 
</P>
<P>
Harvard also has experience. 
</P>
<P>
Corso points to senior Mike Chang, the defending Southern Section champion in 
the 100-yard butterfly (51.60) as a prime example of Harvard's success in 
developing swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
When Chang arrived at Harvard four years ago, he had little club experience and 
clocked the 100 butterfly in 59 seconds. In three years, the Harvard program 
has turned him into a champion. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a Division I-type swimmer," Corso said. "He's going to have to get 
faster, but he can go somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Another beneficiary of Corso's program is senior Jon Paul, a breaststroke 
specialist and individual medley swimmer. He swam the 200-yard individual 
medley in 2 minutes 50 seconds four years ago but has shaved 40 seconds off 
that time. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Shane Loomis swims the butterfly and freestyle and qualified for the 
Southern Section meet in both events. Senior diver Jon Cotter placed 10th last 
year in the Southern Section meet, and Brian Kim is a senior who has scoring 
potential in the breaststroke, according to Corso. Senior sprinter Ryan Crosbie 
might have a breakthrough year, Corso said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's medley-relay team placed second in the Southern Section to area 
rival Agoura. With the core of that team intact, Corso foresees an All-American 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"We're out to prove that we're not just a water polo school," Corso said. "We 
want to attract better kids (for swimming). The word is out in the area. People 
have seen what we've been able to do with kids with non-club experience." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently the word is out. This spring, Corso welcomes blue-chip freshman Matt 
DeFranzo, who could be the final piece in a championship puzzle. DeFranzo, from 
Calabasas, is a proven competitor in the breaststroke, freestyle sprints and 
the individual medley. 
</P>
<P>
Other area programs to watch: 
</P>
<P>
* Agoura (Frontier League) -- Coach Mike Mulligan welcomes back the Valley's 
most accomplished swimmer in junior backstroker Jason Stelle, who won the 
100-yard backstroke in 2-A-record time last year (51.93). Mulligan said Stelle 
is swimming a second faster now. 
</P>
<P>
Stelle, who just returned from international junior meets in East Berlin and 
Paris, also placed seventh in the 200-yard individual medley last year in 
1:56.58. 
</P>
<P>
Stelle, Kevin Driscoll and J. P. Lie return from last year's medley-relay 
championship team. Agoura, which won the Frontier League title, placed fourth 
overall in the team standings, three points from a championship. 
</P>
<P>
Driscoll, a junior, will swim the 100-yard backstroke and 100-yard butterfly. 
Lie is a senior backstroker and freestyler who just missed qualifying last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
* Calabasas (Frontier League) -- Mike Litter, an honorable mention 
All-American, will lead the Coyote charge against Agoura for the league title. 
The senior swimmer is the Southern Section champion in the 100-yard 
breaststroke and placed fifth in the 100-yard butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
While Litter's seasoned presence means instant points for Coach Dave Hershman, 
a youngster also figures to make a splash. Freshman diver Matt Dahl could place 
in the finals, according to Hershman. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Skip Seeder's strongest events are the 50-yard freestyle and 100-yard 
backstroke. 
</P>
<P>
* Hart (Foothill League) -- In seven seasons, Coach Steve Neale's teams have 
never lost a boys' or girls' league title, and the girls' team this year, 
behind junior Evy Wild, probably will add another year to the streak. 
</P>
<P>
Wild placed second place in the 100-yard freestyle in the Southern Section 3-A 
last year in 53.7 seconds. She already has posted a time of 52.9. Wild, a 
sprinter who has qualified for Junior Nationals, has swum the 50 freestyle in 
24.9. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Robin Burton, who placed seventh in the biannual national Junior 
Olympics last summer, is a proven all-around distance and individual-medley 
swimmer. Freshman breaststroker Heather Saxton is another valuable weapon. 
</P>
<P>
The boys' team will be hurt by the loss of three members of last year's 
All-American relay team. Senior Mike Blair returns "a lot stronger," according 
to Neale, to swim freestyle and butterfly. Distance man David Baker, a senior, 
is a Junior Olympic swimmer whose specialties are the 200-yard freestyle (1:53) 
and the 500-yard freestyle (5:05). Freshman Eric Wessig has swum the 100-yard 
butterfly in 56.0 and the 100-yard freestyle in 50.9. 
</P>
<P>
* Westlake (Marmonte League) -- Second-year Coach Ingrid Daland said that she 
will be cracking down on this year's team in hopes of improvment. 
</P>
<P>
For the Warrior girls, freshman Kerry McCloskey is a Junior National swimmer 
who likely will swim individual medley and sprint freestyle. McCloskey is 
joined by potential scorers Robin Cracker (sprint freestyle) and Becky Mandich 
(distance swimmer). 
</P>
<P>
For the boys, Southern Section qualifier Damon Nygren, a junior, should qualify 
again in the 100-yard butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
* Birmingham (City Section) -- Coach Nick Rodionoff will count on senior 
Christian Ballard in the 200-yard and 500-yard freestyle events. Ballard's 
track record is strong. "Whatever he swims he'll win," assistant coach Barbara 
Haskin said. 
</P>
<P>
On the girls' team, Ballard's younger sister, Heather, a freestyler and 
backstroker, is primed to make a name for herself. 
</P>
<P>
She is joined by promising teammates Teresa Frias (backstroke), Irina Karjono 
(butterfly) and Cathy Lee (freestyle, individual medley), who all qualified for 
last year's City championship meet. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Ballard on the boys' team are youngsters with City championship meet 
experience: juniors Steve Hoviss (sprints) and Cris Sax (breaststroke) and 
sophomore Brad McLaughlin (individual medley).

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anaheim Servite High School (17-10) will have a slight height advantage when it

Division boys' basketball title in the Bren Center at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach Corona del Mar (19-9), the Sea View League champion, will play 
Goleta Dos Pueblos (15-13), the fourth-place finisher in the Channel League, 
for the 3-A title at 6:45. 
</P>
<P>
Servite has 6-foot-7 Steve Marusich, averaging 20 points in the playoffs, 6-4 
Mike Coady and 6-4 Adam Anderson. Estancia's tallest player is 6-4 sophomore 
Matt Fuerbringer, who is averaging 17 points in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
In a girls' doubleheader at Cal Poly Pomona, Brea-Olinda (29-0), defending 
Southern Section 3-A Division and State Division III champion, will try to 
extend its 51-game winning streak against Palos Verdes (27-4) in the 3-AA title 
game at 8:30, after Garden Grove Rancho Alamitos (21-3) plays Costa Mesa 
(16-11) in the 3-A final at 6:30. 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda, ranked No. 5 in the nation by USA Today, is led by the backcourt 
of Aimee McDaniel and Tammy Blackburn. In their three playoff games, the 
Wildcats have an average winning margin of 30 points. 
</P>
<P>
Jenny Newsome, who will play at both forward and guard, is averaging 23 points

CANYONS VICTIMIZED BY ERRORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
College of the Canyons pitcher Lance Gibson knew he would be in for a challenge 
against L. A. Harbor. The Seahawks' lineup features six starters from last 
season's team, which finished third in the state and already had beaten Canyons 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
And while Gibson (1-2) rose to the challenge Tuesday, limiting Harbor to six 
hits and three earned runs in eight innings, his teammates did not. The result 
was a 9-3 Harbor win in a nonconference game at Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
"Gibson really gave us fits," Harbor Coach Jim O'Brien said. "Our batters just 
went to sleep against him. He pitched a great game. 
</P>
<P>
"We were like a bunch of little rats scurrying around trying to find what we 
could get." 
</P>
<P>
In the ninth inning, Harbor found five unearned runs to break open a 4-3 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense just fell apart," Canyons Coach Len Mohney said. "Gibson pitched a 
good game. He had thrown 115 pitches and he was getting tired. We had to take 
him out." 
</P>
<P>
Harbor (18-3) sent 10 batters to the plate in the ninth. Jason Farrell, who 
came on in relief of Gibson, gave up four runs in two-thirds of an inning and 
Jeff Adams allowed another. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell struck out Gus Mungaray to start the inning, and after that, things 
fell apart. Shortstop Charlie Fowlks overthrew first on a routine ground ball, 
which allowed Pat Liebsack to advance to second. Liebsack later scored on Mike 
Berry's single. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks scored two more runs when right fielder Chris Vasquez dropped a fly 
ball that would have ended the inning. 
</P>
<P>
"We would have liked to have gone into the bottom of the ninth on our home 
field down by only a run," Mohney said. "But we didn't give ourselves a chance 
and just took ourselves out of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 4-3, in the eighth inning, Canyons (8-5) had an opportunity to tie 
the score. Frank Aguirre hit a two-out pinch-hit single and Josh Bergara, 
running in place of Aguirre, stole second. But Harbor's John Ingram struck out 
Jason Stanley to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher J. R. Trujillo was three for four -- with a tie-breaking home run in 
the fourth and a double -- to lead Canyons' 11-hit attack.

The Greensboro (N.C.) News &amp; Record quoted unidentified sources as saying a 
State Bureau of Investigation inquiry into alleged point-shaving by North 
Carolina State centers on a game played Dec. 27, 1986, that the then 
12th-ranked Wolfpack lost, 67-62, to Tampa, an NCAA Division II school. N.C. 
State was 7-1 at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Dowdy, chief investigator for the SBI, would say only that a former 
Wolfpack player was the focus of the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
The News &amp; Record also reported that former East Carolina basketball coach 
Larry Gillman was one of two men who gave former Wolfpack player Charles 
Shackleford money while he was a student. Another newspaper, The News and 
Observer of Raleigh, N.C., identified Robert D. Kramer, a North Carolina native 
who lives in East Orange, N.J., as the other person who loaned money to 
Shackleford.

IT'S SWEETWATER VS. MT. CARMEL 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Cavers had No. 1-ranked Sweetwater right where they wanted it 
midway through the second quarter. They had the lead (28-17), the momentum and 
appeared to be playing with a ton of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
So what happened? How did San Diego wind up down 10 points with five minutes 
left in the game and on the wrong end of a 64-54 final? 
</P>
<P>
"We got tentative and Sweetwater got some momentum," San Diego Coach Dennis 
Kane said. 
</P>
<P>
And? 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't execute our offense and we didn't rebound on the defensive end, he 
said." 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater Coach Dave Ybarra had another explanation for his team's victory, 
which earned the Red Devils their first Section final appearance since 1980, 
when they won the title. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew sooner or later John (Gilbert) was going to hit a three, or Joe 
(McDowell) would get a dunk, or Carlos (Campbell) would get going," Ybarra 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater (27-1) meets Mt. Carmel -- an easy, 67-46 victor over Patrick Henry 
-- Friday night (8:30) at Golden Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Ybarra apparently knew something because all three premonitions came true. 
Gilbert hit a three, Campbell hit a couple jumpers and McDowell hit a follow 
shot -- his dunk would come later. Just like that, it was a six-point San Diego 
lead (30-24) at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Two more Gilbert three-pointers to open the second half and two Melvin Rushing 
free throws tied the score at 32. But after San Diego took a 40-37 lead with 
2:40 remaining in the third quarter, Sweetwater really turned up the volume. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, San Diego went into hibernation, largely because its leading scorer 
Clark James picked up his fourth foul. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately, Sweetwater went on a 6-0 run sparked by Campbell and McDowell. 
Campbell had a length of the court drive for a layup and McDowell had a steal 
and his dunk. 
</P>
<P>
From there, San Diego closed to one twice, but never took the lead again. the 
Cavers trailed 48-46 after three quarters and 56-46 after a eight unanswered 
points by the Red Devils. 
</P>
<P>
James, a 6-foot-5 forward came back in the game early in the fourth quarter, 
but began going one-on-one and forcing his shots. After scoring 23 points in 
the first three quarters, James missed his last five shots, all long jumpers, 
and was pulled with 1:40 left and San Diego trailing by 59-49. 
</P>
<P>
"We got completely out of our offense," Kane said. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't win with one person," McDowell said. "Our defense is too good for 
that." DAVE McKIBBEN

MT. CARMEL, SANTANA ADVANCE TO SHOWDOWN IN FINAL

<P>
Minutes after the buzzer had sounded, Mt. Carmel's Tara Schwerin was still 
shaking from the generous hugs she received and the emotion she carried. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night in a semifinal of the Division I girls' basketball playoffs, Mt. 
Carmel defeated Poway, 51-48, at Mira Mesa High. 
</P>
<P>
"This shows how much guts and determination we have," said Schwerin, whose team 
defeated a rival Palomar League team that it had lost to in three of four 
previous meetings this season. "This one was good. They beat us the first three 
times, but we beat them the last two." 
</P>
<P>
Schwerin finished with 11 points. The victory advanced Mt. Carmel (21-5) to 
Friday's section final at Golden Hall. Mt. Carmel meets Santana, a 57-42 victor 
over Rancho Buena Vista in Tuesday night's other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, neither team had defeated the other by more than six points. 
This three-point victory for Mt. Carmel was the closest of the five meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"Fifty seems to be the magic," said Mt. Carmel Coach Peggy Brose, whose 
Sundevils return to the finals for the first time since their 1988 victory 
(57-47) over Santana. 
</P>
<P>
With 36 seconds left, and Mt. Carmel ahead, 48-45, Poway's Dawn Gigstad, who 
had made five field goals in the second quarter but had managed only two points 
in the entire second half, raced downcourt and attempted a three-point shot. 
</P>
<P>
But Mt. Carmel's Vicki de Jesus was in perfect position, grabbed the rebound 
and was fouled. She hit both free throws, and extended the lead to 50-45. 
</P>
<P>
Christy Fortney (16 points) got one last shot off, from three-point territory 
at the top of the key with 18 seconds left, pulling Poway (21-5) to 50-48. But 
Mt. Carmel's Rachel Velasco was fouled underneath and made the front end of the 
one-and-one to end the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Carmel guards Velasco (13) and de Jesus (14) combined for 27 points. It 
was, as Brose remembered, the first time her guards have outscored her front 
line. KIM Q. BERKSHIRE

After losing in the semifinals last year and in the finals two years ago, the 
Santana girls finally advanced to the Division I Section final with its victory 
over Rancho Buena Vista. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted this one really bad," said Santana junior center Stephanie Thompson, 
who scored 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't come in with the right attitude last year." 
</P>
<P>
Santana (24-4) got Shawna Edge, RBV's leading scorer, in foul trouble in the 
first quarter and had no problem after that. The Sultans led 15-8 after a 
quarter and 29-19 at half, before blowing the game open in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
They scored the first six points of the third quarter and were never threatened 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Rebecca Aase led Santana with 18 points and Desiree Weimann added 12. Skiy 
Burton paced RBV (21-7) with 18 points. Edge fouled out with 6:00 left in the 
game and finished with just four points. RBV point guard Stephanie Howells went 
out with a knee injury early in the third quarter and scored just two points.

SO. UTAH TOO MUCH FOR USD

Hey, who's in charge of the itinerary? Somebody forgot to tell Southern Utah 
State College that Tuesday's nonconference men's basketball game at the 
University of San Diego was supposed to be a tuneup for the home team, a chance 
for John Jerome to break the single-season scoring record in his final home 
game and a chance for the athletic department to honor athletes in other sports 
at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
All three eventually happened, but the halftime show went the smoothest. 
</P>
<P>
SUSC (12-14) wasn't willing to cooperate. It was trying for its third victory 
in a row and sixth in eight games to reach .500. 
</P>
<P>
SUSC actually came to "play" and and did -- darn near upsetting the hosts. 
</P>
<P>
What was going on? Stick to the program. 
</P>
<P>
The Thunderbirds were supposed to be sparring partners, but instead slapped USD 
around and came close to knocking it out, before falling, 100-91, in front of 
1,631 in the USD Sports Center. 
</P>
<P>
USD (15-12) was only looking for a scrimmage before heading to Los Angeles this 
weekend for the West Coast Conference Tournament, where it will play San 
Francisco Saturday at 8 p.m. It got a tightly contested game that wasn't 
comfortably put away until Wayman Strickland made a pair of free throws with 39 
seconds left to give USD a 96-89 lead. 
</P>
<P>
USD was looking for a confidence booster after finishing third in the WCC by 
dropping games to Loyola Marymount (131-119) and Pepperdine (102-89) Friday and 
Saturday. It eventually got one, but a loss according to Jerome and "the morale 
of this team would have been shot." 
</P>
<P>
Jerome, who had a game-high 23 points, became USD's single-season points leader 
with 527 points. The record came on a nifty inside move with 3:12 remaining and 
pushed USD's lead to 86-77. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Whitmarsh had held the record of 525 set in 1983-84. 
</P>
<P>
Said Jerome, "It's a good thing, I guess. But I wasn't even aware of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe down the line sometime I'll think of it, but now I'm only concerned 
about the next game." 
</P>
<P>
Said Torero Coach Hank Egan, "John has been very much a part of the team, and I 
think that everything he did was in trying to win. I don't think John cares 
very much about the scoring record. 
</P>
<P>
"Scoring is the thing he happens to do best." 
</P>
<P>
Against SUSC scoring was not a problem, but USD found it difficult to pull away 
nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
The game was tied 14 times in the first 30 minutes. After Strickland made a 
short jumper to go ahead, 68-66, with 9:50 left, USD never trailed again, but 
the Thunderbirds threatened. 
</P>
<P>
After scoring eight in a row, SUSC pulled to within 90-85 with 1:55 left. But 
baskets by Anthony Thomas and Pat Holbert and free throws by Strickland iced 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
Holbert punctuated it with a two-hand slam with one second left to give USD its 
first 100-point victory in three years. 
</P>
<P>
With the possibility of games against Loyola and Pepperdine coming up, maybe 
Tuesday was a nice tuneup after all. 
</P>
<P>
Holbert (17 points), Strickland (17), Kelvin Woods (16), Craig Cottrell (12) 
and Thomas (11) gave USD six players in double figure scoring. SUSC was paced 
by DaVor Marcelic with 23. Marcelic is from Zadar, Yugoslavia.

Clorox Co. of Oakland said it is weighing plans to build a bleach-making plant 
and distribution center in Maryland that would provide about 100 new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
A Clorox spokesmen said the company will complete an economic review, find an 
adequate water supply and ensure the necessary permits can be obtained before 
the project moves beyond the planning stages. 
</P>
<P>
Project manager Jim Berger said that if the plant is built, the facility would 
make and distribute bleach to points in Maryland and other states, commanding 
an investment of up to $75 million. 
</P>
<P>
Berger assured county officials that the plant, which would cover up to 360,000 
square feet just south of Aberdeen, would be environmentally "safe" and would 
comply with the Maryland's non-tidal wetlands law that protects marshy areas.

'89 TRADE DEFICIT IS $113.2 BILLION, LOWEST SINCE '84

<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. trade deficit narrowed to $113.2 billion last year, the smallest since 
1984, despite the highest level of foreign oil imports in 10 years, the 
government reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said the deficit shrank by 11% from an imbalance of 
$127.2 billion in 1988, reflecting continued growth in American exports, 
especially manufactured goods and agricultural products. 
</P>
<P>
The 13.4% increase in exports, which rose to a record $361.9 billion, more than 
offset a 6.4% gain in imports, which also hit an all-time high of $475.1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's report on merchandise trade as calculated on a balance of payments 
basis confirmed trends already noted in the department's monthly merchandise 
trade reports, which showed a deficit for all of 1989 of $108.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The new figure is higher because it excludes military sales by the U.S. 
government and makes other minor adjustments in the monthly figures. 
</P>
<P>
For the fourth quarter, the trade deficit posted an increase of 0.9% to $28.8 
billion, following a deficit of $28.6 billion in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
A higher trade deficit would spell trouble for the Bush Administration, which 
is counting on further export growth to prop up the U.S. economy.

SWEATSHOP BILL PUTS HEAT ON MANUFACTURERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblyman Tom Hayden plans to introduce legislation this week aimed at 
cleaning up sweatshops by making garment manufacturers more responsible for the 
treatment of the workers who sew their clothing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a Dickens novel," the Santa Monica Democrat said of ongoing wage, 
hour and child labor abuses in the Orange County and Los Angeles garment 
industries. "You have primitive, 19th-Century sweatshops underpinning an 
economy that is super-opulent, with the rich being in most cases completely 
unaware of the source of their clothes." 
</P>
<P>
Hayden, the chairman of the Assembly Committee on Labor and Employment, said he 
would introduce the bill by Friday, the deadline for new legislation. But even 
as he began drumming up support for the measure, he warned that new laws alone 
would fail unless consumers and retailers begin applying conscience to their 
fashion sense. 
</P>
<P>
"If the people who care about animal rights would only add workers' rights to 
their immediate agenda, you'd have quite a movement going on the West Side (of 
Los Angeles)," Hayden said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with two garment trade groups said the state should spend enough 
money to enforce existing laws before passing new ones. 
</P>
<P>
The last round of garment industry reforms, passed in 1980, required sewing 
shop owners to register with the state and pass an exam covering state labor 
laws, said Joe Rodriguez, executive director of the Garment Contractors Assn. 
of Southern California. The licensing fees were to have been earmarked for 
enforcement, but have instead been siphoned off into the general fund, 
Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Brown, president of the Coalition of Apparel Industries of California, 
said his group has supported a wide array of reform bills but warned that 
over-regulation would doom the $6-billion-a-year Los Angeles apparel industry. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying, very desperately trying to clean up the act in our industry," 
Brown said. "(But) if indeed there's a liability act we can't live with, we'll 
just move out of California." 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, federal and state regulators have uncovered a nest of 
sweatshops paying workers as little as $1 an hour to sew clothing bound for 
Southern California's priciest department stores. 
</P>
<P>
Labor inspectors found that one 7-year-old boy had spent hundreds of hours 
helping his mother, a Mexican immigrant, sew designer clothing in their Santa 
Ana home for wages that averaged $1.45 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
But Brown said publicity given such dramatic cases has obscured the fact that 
most apparel businesses are law-abiding. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some officials and labor leaders say the problem with existing labor 
laws is that they make it relatively simple to fine sweatshop bosses, but 
nearly impossible to punish manufacturers who profit from the sweatshop system 
by having their clothing sewn at rock-bottom prices. 
</P>
<P>
Sewing shop owners complain that some manufacturers pay them so little per 
garment that they cannot pay their workers the $4.25-per-hour minimum wage and 
survive. But legitimate manufacturers, who may have up to 100 sewing 
contractors and subcontractors scattered across Southern California, say they 
haven't the means to police the labor practices of dozens of independent 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Labor in Santa Ana, which began a crackdown on Orange 
County sweatshops last summer, has tried to attack the problem with a dual 
approach: requiring sweatshop owners who underpaid workers to repay the back 
wages, and using the 1938 "hot goods" law to prevent manufacturers from 
shipping across state lines clothing that was made in violation of federal 
labor law. 
</P>
<P>
Since last summer, the department has filed suit against nine suspected 
offenders and obtained consent judgments from four of them. As part of the 
legal proceeding, the department is for the first time holding manufacturers 
accountable for the abuses of their suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
Hayden's bill would take a similar approach on the state level by strengthening 
the "joint liability" provisions of state law. 
</P>
<P>
The California law does make manufacturers liable for labor violations by their 
contractors, but only if the manufacturer knew of the abuses. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to define (liability) in such a way as to give the manufacturer an 
incentive to know," Hayden said. 
</P>
<P>
The exact wording of the liability clause was still being hammered out by 
lawyers Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the law passes, Hayden said, "This is such an entrenched problem, and 
has been going on for so many decades, that people will find ways to avoid the 
letter and spirit of any law like this. So we need a broader strategy." 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the law should provide for disclosure of the names of 
companies cited for abusive labor practices, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The consumer has to start asking the retailer, 'Who makes these clothes and 
where are they made?' and have a sense of morality in their clothing 
selection," Hayden said. "And the manufacturer has to know he'll be liable all 
the way down the line for labor violations. That's the goal." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said there is no question that a few unscrupulous manufacturers squeeze 
their contractors and then turn a blind eye when the contractors underpay their 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
"They go out and shop around, and they bleed (the contractor) to the last dime 
until they go out of business," Brown said. "In many cases they are taken 
advantage of, there is no doubt about it."

ENTREPRENEURS: The editor of Irvine-based Entrepreneurial Woman, a new magazine 
out this week (D1), says women want something different from a business 
magazine. . . . "Women don't have as many role models as men," Rieva Lesonsky 
says. "They want to hear about who is doing these things, as well as what 
they're doing." . . . Elsewhere on the entrepreneurial front, Inc. magazine of 
Boston rates Anaheim as the 10th-most-entrepreneurial city in the nation, based 
on "job growth, business starts and proportion of high-growth companies."

COVENANT HOUSE FOUNDER RESIGNS OVER SEX MISCONDUCT CONTROVERSY

The priest who founded Covenant House, the nation's largest organization for 
runaway youths, resigned Tuesday after months of disputing allegations of 
sexual misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
"The controversy that has surrounded me for the past three months has made it 
impossible for me to lead Covenant House effectively," Father Bruce Ritter said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Macchiarola, a former city schools chancellor who served as acting 
president while the allegations were investigated, also resigned. 
</P>
<P>
Macchiarola, who was named acting president on Feb. 7, said he was quitting 
because the shelter's board of directors had voted against his proposals for 
the future of Covenant House. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Macchiarola said he was not available for interviews but said 
Macchiarola had wanted to conduct reviews, investigations and audits of current 
practices and make changes. 
</P>
<P>
James J. Harnett, executive vice president and chief operating officer, will 
take over the shelter until a permanent successor to Ritter is found, the 
organization announced. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Harnett said he expected an international search for a 
successor to the Franciscan priest to take months and be limited to Roman 
Catholic nuns, brothers and priests.

OIL SPILL: BIOLOGICAL TESTS FIND NO PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT. OFFICIALS SAY BEACHES

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About a mile of beach between the Newport and Balboa piers was reopened Tuesday 
after a battery of biological tests found no public health threat from crude 
oil that blackened long stretches of Orange County shoreline after the Feb. 7 
spill. 
</P>
<P>
Officials announced that several more miles of shoreline in Newport Beach and 
Huntington Beach could be reopened to sunbathers and surfers today, a sign that 
the massive $12-million cleanup of the 394,000-gallon spill from the tanker 
American Trader may soon end. 
</P>
<P>
"We've definitely turned a corner," said a smiling but exhausted Huntington 
Beach Fire Chief Raymond C. Picard. 
</P>
<P>
Mop-up operations have been so thorough that Picard and others say beaches in 
many areas are cleaner than before the spill -- a bonus to beach-goers who have 
been banned for three weeks from 10 miles of some of California's most popular 
strands. Gone are bottle caps, cigarette butts and candy wrappers. "It's 
amazing," said one Newport Beach lifeguard. "It's never been this squeaky 
clean." 
</P>
<P>
Picard said that repeated sanitizing of beaches with heavy machinery has 
removed oil globs and even "fluffed" the sand. 
</P>
<P>
"If you pick this sand up and put it on a slope, you could ski on it," said 
Picard, the city's oil spill operations commander. 
</P>
<P>
As beaches began reopening, British Petroleum Tuesday consolidated its cleanup 
operations at the lifeguard headquarters at Huntington State Beach near 
Magnolia Street, about a half mile from the Santa Ana River where scores of 
workers scrubbed oil-stained rock jetties. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Long Beach, Admiral Paul A. Yost, commandant of the 
U.S. Coast Guard, said the spill recovery effort stands as "a textbook case of 
an excellent cleanup. . . . The job is basically done. There is very little 
left." 
</P>
<P>
In Huntington Beach, concern eased about damage to a newly restored wildlife 
habitat fouled last weekend by a thin layer of oily residue carried into the 
marsh by high tides. Most of the oil sheen in the channel linking the marsh 
with the ocean had been removed by Tuesday, and biologists decided to leave the 
brownish residue that lightly coated several of the wildlife nesting islands, 
fearing that cleanup efforts might disturb the ecologically sensitive mud 
flats. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to let it dry and bake in the sun and hope nature takes care of 
it," said Gary Gorman, executive director of the Huntington Beach Wetlands 
Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
Along the shoreline, public health and safety remained the chief concern, and 
the release Tuesday of the first results from tests on samples of sand fouled 
by the spill were encouraging. The tests are required by local municipalities 
and county health officials as the last step before bans on beach use from 
Newport Harbor to Bolsa Chica State Beach near Warner Avenue could be lifted. 
</P>
<P>
State and local officials have agreed that a beach is safe for public use if 
the average levels of petroleum hydrocarbons -- including benzene and toluene, 
both cancer-causing agents -- are below 100 parts per million. The average for 
84 samples -- taken every 500 feet between the Newport and Balboa piers -- was 
14.3 parts per million, said Richard Wade, president of Med-Tox Associates 
Inc., an Anaheim-based environmental health firm hired by British Petroleum to 
conduct the tests. 
</P>
<P>
"We are satisfied that the beach is safe," said Newport Beach Fire Capt. Randy 
Scheerer. "We opened the beach about noon. It's a step in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
More beaches may reopen today when test results are expected for a stretch of 
shoreline from the Balboa Pier to Newport Harbor and for much of Bolsa Chica 
State Beach. It takes about 30 hours to complete the tests on sand collected at 
depths ranging from six to 10 inches below the surface, Wade said. Chemists 
took samples in Huntington Beach on Tuesday for the first time, and officials 
said some of the city's shoreline there may be reopened, if tests are 
favorable, on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Once beaches reopen, Ronald Rasmussen, an associate adjunct professor of 
community and environmental health at UC Irvine, said exposure to any leftover 
oil could cause minor skin irritation. But he emphasized that any oil residue 
on the beach would not cause long-lasting toxic effects. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

Officials began Tuesday to open more portions of the Orange County shoreline 
that had been tainted by Alaskan crude spilled Feb. 7 by the tanker American 
Trader.

COUNTY REJECTS BIDS ON 'TECHNICALITY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE FRANK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The winning bids of a handful of construction companies that failed to comply 
with the technical details of a new state law were rejected Tuesday by the 
Board of Supervisors, opening the door for future litigation. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted 3 to 1, with Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder dissenting, to 
reject four bids for what one official called a "technicality." 
</P>
<P>
But county lawyers said the bids had to be rejected because they were 
"non-responsive" and in violation of a new law that went into effect Jan. 1. 
The law requires contractors to list the expiration dates of their contractor's 
licenses on bids. 
</P>
<P>
"We are headed for litigation no matter which way we go," said a frustrated Don 
R. Roth, chairman of the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the companies whose bids were rejected argued that the county 
should delay action and allow state Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) to get 
legislation passed to "clean up" the new law. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the R.E. Hazard Contracting Co. argued that the authors of the 
law never intended for it to require contractors that have been in business for 
decades to submit the expiration dates of their licenses. 
</P>
<P>
The rejected bidder on the Pelican Hill Road project complied with the new 
state requirement. A spokesman for that company, C.W. Poss Inc., said the 
contract should be awarded to his company because it was the "lowest responsive 
bidder" on the project. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder argued that the bidding process in this case was surrounded by "total 
confusion" and urged that the board vote to wait to see if corrective 
legislation is quickly passed in Sacramento.GEORGE FRANK

WETLANDS PLAN MAY BE OKD THIS TIME 
</P>

<P>
Mola Development Corp.'s updated plan for the restoration of 41.4 acres of 
wetlands in northwest Seal Beach was submitted to the city and the California 
Coastal Commission for review this week. 
</P>
<P>
Though the plan is very similar to the one rejected by the commission's staff 
in January, commission analyst Larry Simon said this proposal will be 
recommended for approval at the board's March 15 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The previous plan included too much open water and proposed slopes that were 
too steep, the commission staff said. But now that the state Department of Fish 
and Game has approved a larger portion of water for the wetlands, the staff is 
prepared to approve a new plan calling for 47% of the area to be open water, 
Simon said, adding: 
</P>
<P>
"The commission staff feels at this point that the plan is a fairly good one." 
</P>
<P>
Simon said the staff is no longer concerned about the steepness of the slopes 
because improved illustrations provided by Mola show the slopes are more 
gradual than they first appeared. 
</P>
<P>
The wetlands restoration is part of Mola's 355-unit residential project slated 
for the Old Hellman Ranch property. Plans call for the wetlands to be fully 
functional within five years, at which time the land will be dedicated to a 
state environmental agency. MICHELLE NICOLOSI

BIDS FOR MONORAIL TO BE SOUGHT IN JULY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials from five Orange County cities have agreed to seek bids in July for 
the private construction and operation of an 18-mile, central county monorail 
system. 
</P>
<P>
A contract would be awarded to the finalist in February, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"We're definitely on our way," Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young said Tuesday. 
"We will emphasize first that we are interested in a privately owned and 
operated system, although we will identify incentives, such as (monorail) 
station development rights." 
</P>
<P>
Young said a work schedule was adopted Monday during a private, closed-door 
meeting of mayors from Anaheim, Costa Mesa, Orange and Santa Ana and with city 
staff from Irvine. Other cities expressing some interest in joining the 
monorail project -- Huntington Beach, Buena Park and Fullerton -- sent 
observers. 
</P>
<P>
Young said participants at the meeting, which was held in Santa Ana, made some 
minor modifications to a previously published route map and decided to prepare 
a 10- to 12-page prospectus that will have to be approved by each of the five 
city councils before it is mailed to monorail companies, such as the HSST Corp. 
of Japan and Bombardier Inc. of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The five-city system would start in Irvine and go over to an area near South 
Coast Plaza, north on Main Street to a site near MainPlace/Santa Ana being 
developed by Japanese investors. From MainPlace it would head north with a 
possible branch extending to Orange and a branch ending in Anaheim. The firm 
developing the site near MainPlace has offered to include a monorail station in 
that area. 
</P>
<P>
The monorail line would end at a facility near Anaheim Stadium, where Amtrak 
trains, local commuter trains and the monorail would connect with the planned 
Anaheim-Las Vegas high-speed train. 
</P>
<P>
Critics are doubtful, however, that these plans could be carried out without 
increasing commercial and residential density along the route, adding traffic 
congestion near transit stations and using some public funds. 
</P>
<P>
But Young has insisted that companies are "knocking down the doors" for a 
chance to build and operate a private system. 
</P>
<P>
Young said that a prospectus would be released with invitations for bids on 
July 1.JEFFREY A. PERLMAN

STATE OF EMERGENCY EXPIRES ON SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE FRANK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County Board of Supervisors, faced with a deadlock on a routine 
proclamation, allowed the state of emergency on malathion spraying to expire 
Tuesday, exposing the county to possible claims arising from the Medfly 
eradication program. 
</P>
<P>
Under county law, the supervisors are required to renew a proclamation every 
two weeks to extend a state of emergency. That vote was scheduled Tuesday, but 
Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez was on his way to Montevideo, Uruguay, as part of a 
six-member delegation representing the United States at the inauguration of 
President-elect Luis Lacalle. 
</P>
<P>
County Counsel Adrian Kuyper said Tuesday that without the declaration, the 
county would lose the immunity provided by the state of emergency. He would not 
discuss specifics but added that without the immunity, all liability claims 
would have to be considered. 
</P>
<P>
Board Chairman Don R. Roth said a new proclamation declaring the Medfly 
emergency will be back up for a vote on Tuesday. In the past, the proclamation 
has passed on a 3-2 vote, with Roth, Vasquez and Supervisor Thomas F. Riley 
voting in favor and Supervisors Harriett M. Wieder and Roger R. Stanton voting 
against it. 
</P>
<P>
Since Tuesday's vote would have ended in a tie, Roth decided to delete the item 
from the agenda, leaving the county without an emergency declaration for one 
week. He announced the deletion at Tuesday's meeting. There was no debate. 
</P>
<P>
County Agricultural Commissioner James D. Harnett said he asked the state to 
delay its next scheduled spraying Monday night in the Brea, La Habra and 
Fullerton area, but officials said the spraying schedule was too busy to change 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Spraying is also scheduled in the Garden Grove, Santa Ana, Orange, Westminster, 
Stanton, Huntington Beach and Cypress areas. 
</P>
<P>
One staff member who has studied the issue said an example of liability faced 
by the county would be a helicopter crashing into a home. Although the state 
has full responsibility for the spraying program, the county could be named in 
a suit resulting from accidents because it lacked the absolute immunity 
provided by the state of emergency. GEORGE FRANK

<P>
A planned 21-year expansion of Hoag Hospital and areas along West Coast Highway 
between Newport Boulevard and Superior Avenue will be the subject of a meeting 
tonight of the West Newport Beach Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Foulke, senior vice president of the hospital, will discuss the 
development, although specifics have not been determined, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This will more than double the size of the hospital and have major impact on 
the community," said Bill Jennings, member of the ad hoc committee now being 
formed by the association to study expansion issues. "It's both an asset and a 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
Jennings said he expects controversy regarding density of the project, which 
will be under construction for more than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting, open to all Newport Beach residents, will start at 7 p.m. in the 
Newport Beach Council Chambers, 3300 Newport Blvd. LESLIE HERZOG

PLANS FOR RESORT OVERWHELM SOME

<P>
Plans to build a six-acre resort complex around historic Casa Romantica are too 
overwhelming for the sleepy oceanfront community, City Council members said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Although the plans say the project is 20% less dense than surrounding 
neighborhoods, City Council members said the scope of the project goes beyond 
what has been discussed for the site. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot more intense than we are accustomed to," Mayor Candace Haggard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ratkovich Co., a Los Angeles developer, proposed paying the city $6 million in 
cash and other considerations for the six acres of property near the San 
Clemente Pier. Casa Romantica, a historic home built by city founder Ole Hanson 
on bluffs overlooking the ocean, would be the resort's centerpiece. 
</P>
<P>
More than 125 residents reviewed the plans for a 160-room hotel, 60 
condominiums, a restaurant, shops and office space. The site would be 60% open 
space, with garden-style landscaping winding through the project. 
</P>
<P>
Still, several people in the audience expressed dismay at the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"I was shocked to see offices and condominiums," said Harold Oertle. "I do not 
want Los Angeles down here." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Brian J. Rice said his first impression was: "Wow, that is a big 
project. I don't think the council planned on anything of this size." 
</P>
<P>
Casa Romantica would be lost among buildings totaling 275,000 square feet of 
space, Councilman Thomas Lorch said. 
</P>
<P>
Project developers Wayne and Cliff Ratkovich told the audience that the scope 
of the project would benefit the city. The condominiums will add $400,000 in 
property taxes to the $1.2 million the city can expect in annual tax revenue 
from the complex, Cliff Ratkovich predicted. 
</P>
<P>
The city has hired an independent accounting firm to confirm the developer's 
assessment.FRANK MESSINA

A gardener working near a busy intersection Tuesday discovered the body of a 
man believed to have been there for several days, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities are treating the man's death as a homicide, Orange County Sheriff's 
Lt. Bob Rivas said. Identification of the body was not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe the man was in his 30s. 
</P>
<P>
Because the body is partially decomposed, investigators believe it had been 
there at least a couple of days, Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
The gardener reported he had found the body near Crown Valley Parkway and 
Pacific Coast Highway at 2:05 p.m., Rivas said.

7 SUSPECTS ARRESTED IN 2 BANK ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Seven bank robbery suspects were arrested Monday after witnesses helped police 
track getaway cars allegedly used in two unrelated bank robberies, authorities 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Santa Ana Police Department said investigators recovered 
$25,000 in cash and arrested four Fresno residents shortly after the robbery of 
a Wells Fargo Bank in the 1700 block of South Grand Avenue Monday afternoon . 
</P>
<P>
Five minutes later, Westminster police arrested three Oceanside residents 
suspected in the robbery of $1,500 that morning from a Sanwa Bank in the 7700 
block of Westminster Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Trevino Vargas, 42; Frances Rose Tapia, 40; Stephen Serna, 42, and 
Katherine Rosiles, 27, all of Fresno, were arrested after an unidentified 
couple spotted an armed man running from the Wells Fargo Bank to a green Ford 
Fairmont and decided to follow the car, Santa Ana Police Lt. Rick Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently unaware that they were being trailed, Hicks said, the suspects 
headed south through heavy traffic on Edinger Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Near Red Hill Avenue, the couple alerted a Tustin police officer, who radioed 
for assistance before making the arrest without incident at Mitchell Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Westminster police took Henry Thomas Bottoms, 39; Lisa Marie 
Apodaca, 38, and Peter Safford Green, 38, all of Oceanside, into custody in the 
parking lot of a motel a few blocks from the Sanwa Bank. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, Police Lt. Richard Main said, police were assisted by witnesses 
who provided a description of the alleged getaway car, a gold Chevrolet Camaro 
with Kentucky license plates. 
</P>
<P>
One man had entered the bank, brandished a gun and demanded money from a teller 
before escaping, Main said. The three are being held in federal prison at 
Terminal Island, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects in the Wells Fargo robbery were being held on Tuesday in Orange 
County Jail. WENDY PAULSON

UCI LIBRARIAN DENOUNCES BIAS REPORT AS ONE-SIDED

<P>
Responding to a highly critical report on alleged bias in the UC Irvine 
library, the library's chief administrator Tuesday said he disagreed with most 
of the study's conclusions but urged his staff to view it as "a catalyst" to 
improve conditions in the department. 
</P>
<P>
Calvin Boyer, head librarian at UCI, devoted much of his annual "State of the 
Library" address to the report issued last Friday. The study, prepared after a 
five-month investigation by a special faculty committee, criticized Boyer for 
his "dubious" commitment to affirmative action and questioned his leadership 
capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my fervent hope that this document is a catalyst to bring about change 
in the quickest order, with the longest lasting effect we can ensure," Boyer 
said in his speech to the UCI Library Staff Assn. " . . . If my vision is 
clouded, I offer you an opportunity to adjust the glasses." 
</P>
<P>
Boyer, whose speech was generally well-received by staff members in attendance 
at the Campus Village Community Center, did not discuss specifics of the 
report. But in a letter to Academic Senate Chairman Howard Lenhoff, who ordered 
the committee investigation, Boyer lashed out at the report and charged that 
press coverage slanted the committee's findings. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the tenor of the report, its earlier appearance in the press, and the 
power of the press to affect adversely the whole library as witnessed by the 
effects of articles last year, any semblance of due process is beyond 
recovery," Boyer wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Boyer was referring to media reports last year of alleged discrimination in the 
library. The reports led to the faculty committee investigation. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Boyer questioned the committee's findings and charged that some 
of its conclusions "are directly contradicted by the facts." He said alleged 
mistreatment of minority librarians and patrons were isolated incidents. 
</P>
<P>
"It is commonly held throughout the library that there has been a very limited 
number of incidents offensive to any user regardless of ethnic heritage (out of 
tens of thousands of interactions which take place each year) and that public 
service to everyone is on par with the best of university libraries," Boyer 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Boyer added that the panel's finding that his commitment to affirmative action 
is "at best dubious" was "either an error of fact or interpretation." 
</P>

"During the last four years, 37.5% of our permanent appointees have been 
minority librarians; 70.8% have been minority or women librarians," he wrote. 
"Dubious is, it seems to us, a dubious adjective to describe what we understand 
to be among the best record on campus for any UCI school." 
</P>
<P>
He added that "replicable statistical analyses of data (will) directly refute 
contentions" that minority librarians were promoted at a slower rate than their 
white counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
Myron Simon, an English professor who chaired the committee, said he was not 
sent a copy of Boyer's response. However, he said he would be willing to 
discuss Boyer's rebuttal in an open forum. 
</P>
<P>
"We have lots of evidence (of affirmative action violations) that we never even 
used," Simon said. "If he wishes to insist his records are better, we'd be glad 
to respond." 
</P>
<P>
After the speech, Boyer reiterated his assertion that the committee's report 
was one-sided but added that he is pleased that the study is likely to spur 
change in library procedures. "There is always room for improvement," he said.

BOARD VOTES TO MOVE CONTINUATION SCHOOL TO FOUNTAIN VALLEY HIGH

<P>
Despite the protests of about 100 angry parents, the Huntington Beach Union 
High School district board voted unanimously Tuesday to move Wintersburg 
Continuation High School onto the campus of Fountain Valley High School. 
</P>
<P>
The parents who turned out for the board meeting said they feared increased 
crime and vandalism at Fountain Valley High and the surrounding community if 
the school was moved onto the campus. Many of those who addressed the board 
characterized the Wintersburg students as troublemakers, drug users and gang 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Charmayne Bohman, a board member, criticized the audience for judging the 
students in such harsh terms. "I feel very frustrated and very opposed to the 
bigotry that has been shown here tonight," Bohman said. 
</P>
<P>
After making a lengthy presentation supporting his proposal to relocate the 
continuation school, Supt. Lawrence Kemper also took exception to the 
opponents' characterization of Wintersburg students. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as the kids who attend this school are concerned, they are regular 
kids. Any parent that doesn't have some problem with their teen-ager doesn't 
have a teen-ager." 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, first presented in December, the continuation school would 
move from its present location on Golden West Avenue in September. About 177 
students with behavioral, academic and attendence problems are enrolled at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Those opposed to the move had worked feverishly, posting signs and circulating 
petitions in an effort to dissuade board members from carrying out the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"We know of eight different gangs that attend that school, and they'll come 
with it when it moves into the community," said Corli Guild, head of the 
30-member opposition group in Fountain Valley. "Of course, no one will confirm 
this, but we know it's true." 
</P>
<P>
Wintersburg Principal Dick Maynard, Huntington Beach police and residents in 
the area where the school is located say they haven't experienced any problems 
with the students.

COMMUNITY CLINICS CHEER TOBACCO-TAX FUNDING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Directors of Orange County's financially strapped community clinics on Tuesday 
welcomed a proposal to funnel state tobacco tax revenue to their programs, 
saying the money will help provide essential health care for low-income 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
"Obtaining funds is a daily struggle and ongoing need for community clinics," 
said Faith Hagerty, president of the Orange County Coalition of Community 
Clinics. 
</P>
<P>
The money "is definitely going to be helpful and will ensure, at least for a 
while, that low-income people continue to be served," she added. 
</P>
<P>
However, some clinic directors objected to parts of the funding proposal by 
county health officials that would penalize clinics that are not Medi-Cal 
providers. 
</P>
<P>
The county is scheduled to receive about $22 million a year for two years from 
a surtax levied on cigarette and other tobacco products under Proposition 99, 
the statewide initiative approved by voters in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to recommending new funds to help shore up the county's fractured 
trauma system and establish two new birthing centers, health-care officials 
also proposed that the Board of Supervisors allocate $1.5 million of the 
tobacco tax monies to the county's 12 community clinics. 
</P>
<P>
The clinics are nonprofit, independent agencies that play a vital role in 
providing health care for indigent and undocumented patients and those that do 
not qualify for Medi-Cal or the county's medical program for poor people, 
Indigent Medical Services (IMS). 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, nearly 122,000 people countywide received basic health services 
through the clinics, said Hagerty. "These are people who have no access to 
health care anywhere else, and the clinics go uncompensated," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal unveiled by the county Health Care Agency on Monday, about 
$705,000 of the funds would be used for direct patient services -- to help 
reimburse clinics for their large share of uncompensated cases. 
</P>
<P>
Another share of the money would be used to strengthen the Coalition of 
Community Clinics by hiring an administrator to establish and coordinate 
centralized services, such as data collection, billing and training. 
</P>
<P>
"The marvelous aspect is that we are 12 very diverse and unique community 
clinics and are able to come together with primary goals of opening access for 
low-income patients," said Margie Fites Siegel, executive director of Planned 
Parenthood Orange County. "This is a recognition that we are an integral part 
of the health-care system in the county." 
</P>
<P>
Among the more controversial recommendations by the Health Care Agency is that 
some clinics receive a lower level of funding as an "incentive" to persuade 
them to join the state Medi-Cal system, which provides reimbursements for care 
of the poor. 
</P>
<P>
"The feeling was that (becoming a Medi-Cal provider) would provide a more 
permanent source of revenue to the clinics," said Health Care Agency medical 
director, Herb Rosenzweig. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, four clinics would receive the lower level of funding. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Forbath, executive director of the non-Medi-Cal Share Our Selves clinic, 
which serves nearly 15,000 patients a year, called the disparity "punitive." 
</P>
<P>
"We have a different philosophy," she said. "We have never been interested in 
collecting money, and we don't have the staff to do it. We have also had a 
great deal of freedom to be outspoken in community on issues. If we joined the 
company store so to speak, that might change."

DANA HILLS SETS SAIL FOR SOUTH COAST FINAL

<P>
The championship dreams of Mission Viejo and Dana Hills high schools were 
blowing in the wind Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 26 shots attempted by both teams in the girls' 4-A semifinal soccer 
match, only three were taken into the breeze whipping in from the west on Dana 
Hills' field. 
</P>
<P>
But one of those shots, by forward Amy Kroeger 30 minutes into the second half, 
was the difference as Dana Hills (22-3-3) held on to defeat Mission Viejo, 2-1, 
and advance to the 4-A championship match against sixth-ranked El Toro (20-3-3) 
at 6 p.m. Friday at Gahr High School in Cerritos. The teams were co-champions 
of the South Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro defeated South Torrance, 2-1, in the other semifinal Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
It will be Dana Hills' first trip to the girls' soccer final. 
</P>
<P>
"We went out and worked hard and won the balls we had to," Dana Hills Coach Ken 
Ezratty said. "But the wind was definitely a factor." 
</P>
<P>
Especially on the volley that Dana Hills midfielder Jenny Koenig launched with 
her left foot into the east goal 33:22 into the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Koenig took a pass from Jonelle Tortamasi on the sideline, spun and drilled a 
hanging drive from 35 yards. The wind helped it hook into the upper left corner 
of the net past Mission Viejo goalkeeper Tamar de Fries. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Rollins helped Dana Hills get its insurance goal. Promoted from junior 
varsity because she can throw further than any other Dolphin, Rollins tossed a 
strike in front of the net from the corner, and Kroeger thumped it in with a 
rolling header for a 2-0 lead.

DISPUTED CALLS HELP LA SALLE DEFEAT ORANGE LUTHERAN IN OVERTIME

La Salle of Pasadena scored a disputed goal halfway through the second overtime 
period to defeat Orange Lutheran, 1-0, in the semifinals of the Small School 
division boys' soccer playoffs Tuesday at Orange Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
Senior sweeper Matt Pendroh took a pass directly in front of the Orange 
Lutheran goal and kicked it into the net. 
</P>
<P>
The score held up and Orange Lutheran (16-7-2) was eliminated from the 
playoffs. La Salle (14-4-3) will meet the winner of the L.A. Baptist-Harvard 
match for the small schools championship. 
</P>
<P>
"The referee called offsides on the goal," Orange Coach Del Montel said, "but 
it was waved off by the center official and they kicked the goal. I protested 
but (the official) said it was only by a few feet. That was their only shot on 
our goal (in the second overtime) and they were offsides." 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, Orange Lutheran was stung by a referee's decision. Lee 
Back's apparent goal 12 minutes into the first half was nullified by an 
offsides call. Later, an apparent goal was kicked out of the net by a La Salle 
player. "That ball was in the net, but the side official was out of position 
and didn't see it," Montel said. TOM BIRSCHBACH

Al Mejia of El Toro High School made his coach look good in the second half of 
Tuesday's Southern Section 3-A semifinal boys' soccer match against Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
Only two minutes after entering the game, Mejia scored to give El Toro a 1-0 
victory over Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers (14-3-2) will make their first appearance in a Southern Section 
boys' soccer final. They will meet San Gabriel Valley League champion Cerritos 
Saturday at 8 p.m. at Gahr High School. 
</P>
<P>
"We play in a tough league with Mission Viejo and Dana Hills," Coach Carlos 
Arce said, "but Redlands was a very tough team too. They were very physical and 
forced us to play with discipline. We've faced physical teams before, but no 
one with as much skill." 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen minutes into the second half Barry crossed a pass from the right 
corner and Mejia drilled it past Redlands goalkeeper Jim Moran to give El Toro 
the only goal it would need. Redlands finished the season 21-5-2. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro goalkeeper Kevin Rowe, a two-time All-South Coast League selection, 
recorded eight saves for his second shutout of the playoffs.

<P>
Throughout his team's 2-1 semifinal victory over South Torrance High School 
Tuesday, El Toro girls' soccer Coach Bob Chavez fretted. 
</P>
<P>
There were the wasted shots. 
</P>
<P>
"We should have four goals right now!" Chavez yelled at his players, who led, 
1-0, after the first half. 
</P>
<P>
There was the lack of enthusiasm in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"C'mon girls, suck it up! Let's control this thing! C'mon!" Chavez yelled. 
</P>
<P>
And worst of all in Chavez's opinion, there was the lack of his favorite pain 
reliever. 
</P>
<P>
"I forgot my Advil today," he said. "I usually take three to keep me calm." 
</P>
<P>
His worries were put to rest when senior Skye Everly scored the winning goal 
with six minutes remaining. Everly's goal, which came off a header by Shawn 
Viloria, qualified El Toro for the Southern Section 4-A championship game 
against fifth-ranked Dana Hills (22-3-1) at 6 p.m. Friday at Gahr High School 
in Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills, which defeated Mission Viejo, 2-1, in the other semifinal Tuesday, 
tied El Toro (20-3-3) for first place in the South Coast League this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just happy it's an all-South Coast League final," Chavez said. "We have 
the toughest league in CIF. A South Coast League team has won the (4-A) title 
for the last four years. And we didn't even have one (South Coast League) team 
seeded in the top four." 
</P>
<P>
El Toro dominated the first half Tuesday, outshooting South Torrance, 11-2. But 
the only shot that mattered was that by Kymm Maniscalco, who scored off 
Everly's throw-in at the 10-minute mark. 
</P>
<P>
At halftime, South Torrance Coach Stacey Chapman scolded her players for 
uninspired play. "You've got to try harder," she said. "You've got to run 
harder. You've got to run!" 
</P>
<P>
South Torrance (18-6-1) responded with intensity, especially junior midfielder 
Gillian Boxx, who dominated when the ball was in the air. After two close 
attempts, South Torrance tied the score, 1-1, when Boxx scored on a short shot 
with 10 minutes left to play. 
</P>
<P>
But El Toro came back, storming South Torrance goalkeeper Heidi Emmrich with 
several shots. One got past Emmrich, but, after a quick skirmish, the ball 
rolled beyond the box and out of bounds to give El Toro a corner kick. 
</P>
<P>
Shawna Berke took the kick, which Viloria headed high, and Everyly chipped it 
in for the winning goal. The goal did not escape controversy, however, as South 
Torrance believed Emmrich was fouled by several El Toro players during the 
winning play. 
</P>
<P>
"That's kind of the biggest bummer of it all," Chapman said. "They foul our 
goalkeeper and they score." 
</P>
<P>
Chavez said: "That's a 50-50 ball. Everybody's fielding it. And that goalie -- 
we talked about it at halftime -- she has soft hands. Anything she gets, go 
for, because she's dropped some before."

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK; 
</P>
<P>
STILL IN CRITICAL CONDITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The shuffling at Cal State Fullerton has been going on for some time, as the 
athletic department works to correct inequities between men's and women's 
sports at the school. 
</P>
<P>
The women's basketball program and the women's softball program have moved from 
cramped offices into larger ones. 
</P>
<P>
Maryalyce Jeremiah, the women's basketball coach, now drives a courtesy car, as 
does men's basketball coach John Sneed. 
</P>
<P>
But the critical issue at Fullerton, as usual, is money. The success of 
Fullerton's well-intentioned efforts to improve its support for women's 
programs will be difficult to judge until late this week, when the university's 
Athletics Council is expected to approve a budget recommendation to be 
submitted to University President Jewel Plummer Cobb for her approval. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge is to find a way to add $145,000 to the budgets of women's sports 
in an athletic program that already reaches a financial crisis point almost 
every year. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the department has a deficit of $236,000, and has responded with 
actions as serious as a staff salary cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Cobb has pledged her support to the additional funding for the women's 
programs. In order to reach a workable budget for next year, it may require 
cutting as many as three sports from Fullerton's 17-sport program, school 
officials have said. Football is not being considered. 
</P>
<P>
And although a department report says it is not "a wise solution" to take money 
from already minimal men's budgets to resolve the situation, that seems very 
likely to happen. 
</P>
<P>
That, in turn, could create another sort of inequity. Fullerton might find that 
its women's sports are funded competitively with the schools they compete 
against, while the men's programs compete against programs that operate on much 
larger budgets. 
</P>
<P>
The figure of $145,000 is from a department study that was undertaken at the 
urging of a group of women's coaches. That study showed that Fullerton was not 
in compliance with Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination 
in education and requires spending for women's programs to be proportional to 
the number of women participants. 
</P>
<P>
For Fullerton to be in compliance, thereby avoiding the potential for a 
lawsuit, the women's budget must be 31% of the total, the approximate 
percentage of women to men athletes at the school, according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
The additional money might mean marked changes in the women's programs. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, some men's teams flew to Northern California, but comparable 
women's teams traveled by bus or van. Recruiting budgets for men's sports have 
been eight times greater than women's recruiting budgets. In basketball, the 
men's recruiting budget has been 20 times the women's. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, coaching salaries in women's sports at Fullerton are among 
the highest in the nation. The full-time women's coaches -- Jeremiah, softball 
coach Judi Garman and gymnastics' Lynn Rogers -- each make about $65,000, the 
same as Sneed, the men's basketball coach. Gene Murphy, the football coach, is 
paid $65,000 plus an unspecified supplement. 
</P>
<P>
The women's coaches who have sought additional funding have sought only what is 
already guaranteed by law. How the athletic department responds to the budget 
crisis created by that request won't be known until a final budget is 
submitted. 
</P>
<P>
Leanne Grotke, associate athletic director, said the department is proud of its 
efforts to achieve equity, saying Fullerton had not been "seriously 
discriminatory" in any practices and is implementing standards more rigid than 
those required by law. 
</P>
<P>
Football Coach Gene Murphy has been given the go-ahead to hire two assistants, 
bringing his staff back to the NCAA standard of nine by the beginning of spring 
practice, Athletic Director Ed Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton lost two assistants in recent weeks. Ed Donatell resigned to take an 
assistant's job with the New York Jets last week, and Preston Dennard said he 
lost his position because of budget problems. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll would not comment on both coaches being replaced in spite of the budget 
problems, but speculation is that the two positions will be filled at a lower 
salary level. 
</P>
<P>
Heavyweight wrestler David Jones is getting better. Coach Dan Lewis is certain 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately or unfortunately, I can tell," Lewis said. "I'm his workout 
partner." 
</P>
<P>
Jones, ranked ninth in the nation by Amateur Wrestling News, is expected to 
qualify for the NCAA championships March 22-24 at College Park, Md. 
</P>
<P>
"The way he's been wrestling lately, he could win the nationals," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
Jones is back in form again after missing several weeks of the season with a 
kidney problem. He was held out of wrestling as a precautionary measure on a 
doctor's advice, but was cleared to participate after consulting a specialist. 
</P>
<P>
"Since then, he's been training real hard," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
The baseball team warmed up for the Big West Conference season with a 16-2 
exhibition victory Monday over Waseda University, the Japanese collegiate 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton, concerned about its offense during the preseason, had 23 hits in the 
game, including two home runs by Phil Nevin, who had hit two against U.S. 
International Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans have had at least 10 hits in their past nine games going into a 
weekend series against the University of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
The wrestling team was forced to forfeit its final match of the regular season 
to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo after the NCAA ruled the Titans had broken a rule 
by practicing with another team. Fullerton held practices with Minnesota for 
two days in January following a meet with Minnesota. Although Coach Dan Lewis 
said NCAA rules do not explicitly prohibit joint practices, Lewis said the 
sessions were ruled to be scrimmages, thus violating a rule that limits the 
number of scrimmages and matches. . . .

MAGAZINE PINS HOPES ON WOMEN IN BUSINESS

<P>
Role models are more important to women than to men. Personalities and life 
styles are more interesting to women than to men. Men are more practical, women 
more romantic. 
</P>
<P>
Although they may sound like sexist stereotypes, these conclusions are part of 
the marketing strategy for a new Irvine-based magazine whose overall 
orientation is anything but chauvinist. Entrepreneurial Woman, which hit the 
newsstands Tuesday, is in fact also based on the premise that women will soon 
be running half of all businesses in the United States and form an affluent and 
fast-growing market for a new publication. 
</P>
<P>
And the publishers of Entrepreneurial Woman, who also publish Entrepreneur, 
believe this market isn't being addressed by either the myriad women's 
magazines or the mainstream business magazines. 
</P>
<P>
"There aren't any direct competitors," Publisher Clare N. Thain said. "There 
are some out there -- Working Woman, Working Mother, Savvy Woman -- but they 
tend to be more oriented to the corporate businesswoman. Ours is a niche book." 
</P>
<P>
Thain said this niche already contains 3 million to 4 million female 
small-business owners, and he cited U.S. Small Business Administration figures 
showing that more than half of all new businesses today are started by women. 
Initially, Entrepreneurial Woman will aim to reach 200,000 of them, half 
through subscriptions and half through newsstand sales. 
</P>
<P>
One key question is whether women really want anything different from men in a 
business magazine. Editor Rieva Lesonsky, who like most of the 86 employees at 
Entrepreneur will do double duty with both magazines, said Entrepreneurial 
Woman will differ from its older sibling by focusing more on personalities. 
</P>
<P>
"Women don't have as many role models as men," she said. "They want to hear 
about who is doing these things, as well as what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
Thane added that "men tend to be more oriented towards the how-to," while women 
have "stronger emotional ties" to people-oriented activities, such as 
networking groups. These conclusions, he said, came from focus groups and 
discussions with organizations such as the National Assn. of Women Business 
Owners. 
</P>
<P>
Judith Daniels, a New York magazine consultant and founder of Savvy Woman 
magazine, agreed that women's concerns generally are neglected by mainstream 
business magazines such as Business Week, Fortune, Forbes and Inc. "If you're a 
woman, you like to see your work life addressed, and you just don't see it in 
the business press," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels added, however, that most women's magazines now recognize that their 
readers are working, and they make an effort to address those concerns. She 
noted that even life style magazines such as Glamour, for which she is a 
contributing editor, now contain articles about the working world. 
</P>
<P>
Savvy Woman and Working Woman, moreover, are well-established magazines with 
large circulations. Working Woman alone has a circulation of nearly 1 million, 
outstripping even the major business magazines. 
</P>
<P>
But Lesonsky claimed that these publications are strictly aimed at the 
corporate 
</P>
<P>
and professional women, not entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
"Working Woman gives maybe six pages out of 130" to women who own their own 
businesses, she said. "I don't consider it a competitor." 
</P>
<P>
From an advertiser's point of view, though, professional women are an 
attractive, affluent market. Entrepreneurial Woman still must persuade people 
that its readership is made up of established businesswomen and not struggling 
would-be entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
A heavy presence of ads from franchise operators, mail-order houses and 
little-known companies promoting "get-rich-quick" schemes has long 
characterized Entrepreneur, and the premier issue of Entrepreneurial Woman 
appears to follow that pattern. Such ads might bring in revenue, but they don't 
impress more desirable national advertisers such as automobile, computer and 
luxury goods companies. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Entrepreneurial Woman has some strong advantages starting out, not the 
least of which is the existing infrastructure of Entrepreneur. Company Chairman 
Peter Shea said just eight people are dedicated solely to the new publication, 
with the rest of the staff coming from Entrepreneur. Similarly, the new 
magazine will be able to call on many of the same advertisers and generally 
take advantage of the network of contacts already built by Entrepreneur. 
</P>
<P>
Entrepreneurial Woman also had a very strong response to its May pilot issue, 
Shea said. Of the 100,000 people who received the pilot, 12,000 responded 
either to a subscription request or a survey. Shea called that response 
"phenomenal." 
</P>
<P>
The launch costs for the new magazine have been kept to $1.5 million, Shea 
said, and profits are expected in the first year. Making money that quickly 
would be highly unusual for a new magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The first issue of Entrepreneurial Woman contains 128 pages -- a roughly 50-50 
mix of editorial and advertising -- and features a cover profile of Rachel 
Perry, who built a $10-million skin-care company. Shorter columns bear titles 
such as "Management Smarts," "Family Matters" and "Role Model." 
</P>
<P>
Daniels, the New York magazine consultant, said she hadn't seen a copy of 
Entrepreneurial Woman but said the response to the pilot issue sounded 
"incredible." And though she is generally skeptical about the prospects for any 
start-up magazine -- the great majority of them fail -- she agreed that 
Entrepreneurial Woman may have found a niche. 
</P>
<P>
"It's another slice of a slice of a slice of the pie," Daniels said. "The 
largest category of circulation is women's magazines, and it's always in flux.

INVESTORS, TOMAR THRIFTS' NEW PARENT IS CLOSER TO HOME 
</P>

<P>
The sale of two thrift and loans in Orange to the large Fremont General Corp. 
in Santa Monica gives them a parent closer to their home and to their 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
Fremont's acquisition of Tomar Financial Corp. in Fresno, the parent of 
Investors Thrift &amp; Loan and Liberty Thrift &amp; Loan, was completed 
recently for an undisclosed price between $5 million and $10 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
The thrifts will continue to operate under their current business plans but 
will get more capital to help them grow, said James A. McIntyre, Fremont's 
president. 
</P>
<P>
The thrifts take deposits and make automobile and home improvement loans as 
well as small commercial real estate loans of up to $1.5 million, said Murray 
Zoota, president of both thrifts. He and his staff will remain on the job. It 
has not been decided yet if the two thrifts will be merged. 
</P>
<P>
"We're real excited about the transaction," Zoota said. "We have a much 
stronger parent who is more in tune with financial services." 
</P>
<P>
Tomar was owned by a Fresno family that manufactures hobby paints for ceramics 
and T-shirts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the thrifts had nearly $182 million in assets at the end of December 
and earned a combined $961,000 last year, nearly triple the amount earned the 
previous year. They have a total of 15 branches throughout California, mostly 
in rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
McIntyre said the acquisition will help Fremont expand its financial services 
in the state. Fremont is one of the state's larger workers' compensation 
insurers and operates companies involved in commercial finance, commercial 
mortgage banking and life insurance. One of its subsidiaries, Commercial 
Bankers Life Insurance Co., is based in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Thrift and loans are a cross between banks and finance companies. Deposits at 
Investors and Liberty are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which 
regulates T&amp;Ls essentially as if they were banks.

The donations to the Carol DiMaiti Stuart Foundation Inc. have come in small 
increments, often as little as $5. With the checks come prayers and letters 
that tear at the emotions of a family that has already seen its heart ripped to 
shreds. 
</P>
<P>
"I am 70 years old and living on a fixed income, otherwise my check would be 
for a larger amount," wrote a woman who enclosed $10. "I had a beautiful 
26-year-old daughter who was murdered by her husband, and I believe I know the 
heartache of her family." 
</P>
<P>
Another couple sent in an equally sad story along with their $10 check. "My 
wife and I lost our 18-year-old son in December, 1984. He was shot to death, 
and his girlfriend was raped. They have never found his killer, and after five 
years, we still live with this every day." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the donations are more lavish. David Rockefeller Jr., a Cambridge 
resident, gave $1,000. Vice President Dan Quayle sent $150. Gov. Michael 
Dukakis sent $50 and invited the DiMaiti family to lunch. Rep. Barney Frank, 
the Democratic congressman from Brookline who has had troubles of his own of 
late, included this handwritten sentiment with his check for 
</P>
<P>
"The word is overused, so I generally avoid it, but you have done a genuinely 
noble thing. We are all in your debt." 
</P>
<P>
Small and large, the gifts to the foundation Carol Stuart's family started in 
honor of the woman whose bizarre murder last October shocked the city have 
"gone beyond our wildest dreams," her brother, Carl DiMaiti, said here Monday. 
Since it was announced just a month ago, the Carol DiMaiti Stuart Foundation 
has amassed more than $270,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We are just amazed by the positive response we have received," said DiMaiti, 
37. "We get bags and bags of mail. Caring letters, personal letters. Letters 
from people we have never met, some of whom tell us that they, too, have lost 
sons or daughters." 
</P>
<P>
Does it help? Carl DiMaiti was asked. 
</P>
<P>
"It helps," he said. "It definitely helps." 
</P>
<P>
Like almost everyone who heard the story, which received national attention, 
the DiMaiti family at first accepted Charles Stuart's account that he and his 
wife, Carol, had been abducted by a black gunman who leaped into their car as 
they were leaving a childbirth class and later shot the couple, killing Carol 
and seriously wounding her husband. The crime, which occurred in Boston's 
racially mixed Mission Hill area, stirred fears of urban violence and summoned 
up racial anger and tension. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Stuart was 7 1/2 months pregnant when she died. Delivered prematurely by 
Cesarean section, her son Christopher lived for 17 days after the assault. 
</P>
<P>
From his hospital bed, Charles Stuart wrote a tender, moving letter to his wife 
that was read at her funeral. Later, he recovered sufficiently from his wounds 
to view a police lineup and identify a suspect, Willie Bennett, as looking most 
like the man Stuart said shot him and killed his wife. 
</P>
<P>
But then Stuart himself became a suspect in the crime. His younger brother 
Matthew told police that he had been at the crime scene, and he had picked up a 
bag containing a revolver and Carol Stuart's handbag. Matthew Stuart said when 
he got home and opened the handbag, he found jewelry that included his 
sister-in-law's engagement ring. On Jan. 4, Charles Stuart plunged to his death 
from a bridge over Boston Harbor, an apparent suicide. 
</P>
<P>
The sensational case is now under investigation by a grand jury, which this 
week heard testimony from several of Charles Stuart's five brothers and 
sisters. In addition, charges of racial harassment by Boston police against 
early suspects in the case -- all of them black -- have brought the FBI into 
the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Carl DiMaiti said his family has had no contact with the Stuart family since 
Charles Stuart's death. He said he would have no comment on the grand jury's 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
Few people would have blinked if the DiMaiti family had chosen to turn its back 
on the whole sad saga. But three weeks after Charles Stuart's death, the 
DiMaitis called a press conference at which their lawyer, Marvin N. Geller, 
announced the formation of a scholarship fund in Carol DiMaiti Stuart's memory. 
In an effort to "promote better race relations throughout the city and greater 
Boston," the foundation will grant college scholarships to students from the 
Mission Hill area, where Carol Stuart was killed. 
</P>
<P>
Reading from a statement the family prepared together the night before, 
64-year-old Giusto DiMaiti, a former pasta salesman, lauded his daughter as 
"truly the brightest of lights in our lives, a light that will never go out in 
our minds. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"All she ever wanted," Giusto DiMaiti read as his wife, Evelyn, 58, fought back 
tears beside him, "was to be a good daughter, wife and mother and be happy in 
her life." 
</P>
<P>
Were she able to see the outpouring in her memory, Carol Stuart "would cry," 
her brother said Monday. Seven years his junior, Carol Stuart wore her emotions 
close to her sleeve, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Like his late sister, Carl DiMaiti, a former high school teacher and track 
coach who now owns a wholesale pizza company, has a big, ready smile that seems 
particularly forthcoming when he is talking about Carol. But he also confessed 
to a hint of big-brotherly bullying when it came to his little sister's special 
blend of constant cheer and easy tears. 
</P>
<P>
"To torture her as a kid, I would make her watch things like 'Wuthering 
Heights,' " DiMaiti said, and laughed. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, DiMaiti said, it would have been easier for his family to "just 
put the nightmare behind us, pretend that it never existed, at least publicly." 
</P>
<P>
But "walking away was never really an option," the son who has become the 
family spokesman said. Until this week, when he agreed to discuss the 
foundation but not the crime in which his sister was killed, even Carl DiMaiti 
has refused interviews. His parents have still chosen to remain in seclusion. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a moral obligation to Carol," DiMaiti said. "There's just too much to 
say about her that existed prior to that one night." 
</P>
<P>
DiMaiti said he and his parents bristle, for example, when they hear Carol 
Stuart "pigeonholed" as "a yuppie, an upwardly mobile lawyer." It is true that 
she graduated in the top one-third of her class at Boston's Suffolk Law School, 
DiMaiti said, "but she also had huge loans when she got done." All through law 
school, he pointed out, she worked as a waitress at a bar and lounge in the 
blue-collar town of Revere. It was while working there in the year after 
graduating from Boston College that she met Charles Stuart, then a young 
dishwasher and assistant chef. 
</P>
<P>
Even while working her way through law school, his sister was "a studyholic," 
DiMaiti said. Her efforts were especially appreciated, he added, by a father 
who "went way beyond adoration" in the way he loved his only daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"Listen, my father used to carry her report card around in his wallet," DiMaiti 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, DiMaiti said, the family never even considered establishing a 
scholarship at Boston College or at Suffolk Law School. 
</P>
<P>
"We just thought it could do the greatest amount of good in Mission Hill," he 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of her murder and of the tensions aroused by the tale of racial 
crime that Charles Stuart spun, "I think there's an unspoken bond between us 
and the residents of Mission Hill," DiMaiti said. "An unspoken bond as 
victims." 
</P>
<P>
More than simply memorializing his sister, DiMaiti said he hopes the 
scholarship fund might help to heal the wounds suffered by the community as a 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't be so presumptuous as to think this is the end-all," he said of the 
foundation, whose exact workings have yet to be determined. "But it may help." 
</P>
<P>
The gesture may help his family as well, he said. Calling the family's 
involvement with the foundation cathartic, he said, "I think this has given us 
a different focus. It's not that anything is over, but that there is a new 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"Carol is gone, there's nothing we can do about that, but there is something we 
can do" to help keep her spirit alive. 
</P>
<P>
Before the foundation was announced, DiMaiti said the family was racked by 
doubts. "We asked ourselves all those questions: 'How can this be happening to 
us? How can we have been so naive? How can she have been so naive, because she 
was such a smart girl?' " 
</P>
<P>
By shifting their attention and their energy to the foundation, DiMaiti said, 
he and his parents have let go of some of those painful feelings. "We have a 
commitment to stay here and see this through," he said. When the foundation 
does begin issuing grants to the young people of Mission Hill, he went on, "I 
think every student who receives a scholarship will remind my parents of 
Carol." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, DiMaiti said, he still battles the anger he felt when he learned 
that his brother-in-law's story of a black gunman was pure fabrication, and 
that Charles Stuart may have pulled the trigger himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you imagine going to the hospital to see him?" he asked incredulously. 
"Can you imagine comforting him? That's what I find so mind-boggling now." 
</P>
<P>
But he acknowledges that such feelings are part of the "roller coaster" his 
family has been on since last October. 
</P>
<P>
"You think your faith in mankind can't get any lower," he said. And then, with 
the flood of support the foundation has experienced, "you get pumped up. But 
never back to the same level. You know it will never be the same." 
</P>
<P>
But Carl DiMaiti obviously shares his late sister's sunny insistence that a 
smile will brighten any darkness. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I keep coming back to this, but this is the only positive thing we 
could do out of all this," DiMaiti said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that gives us a tendency to hold onto it even harder."

<P>
After 25 years on the road as a rock drummer, back-up singer and "Star Search" 
comic, Jenny Jones is ready to be a somebody. And if Jones hasn't yet become a 
household name, eight weeks of spotty controversy surrounding her Girls' Night 
Out comedy show has put her into the Rolodexes of the people who book the rich 
and famous. 
</P>
<P>
Connie Chung has called. Producers offering to do TV specials. Magazines 
sniffing out cover stories. 
</P>
<P>
During Girls' Night Out, so the handbills boast, there are "No Men Allowed." 
</P>
<P>
And that fact has sold out 10 consecutive shows for Jenny Jones, gotten 
snippets of her routine onto ABC's "20/20" and nearly landed her in trouble 
with the law in two cities in the last two months. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the "No Men Allowed" part of her slogan has of late become a moot 
point, at least at Pasadena's Ice House, where the box office acknowledges that 
it is against the law to discriminate against men who want to buy tickets. 
Jones' Monday show has sold out -- "We don't have reservations specified by men 
and women, but it's mostly women" -- and the Sunday show added to accommodate 
the overflow is not turning men away. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Jones insists that the show will not go on if men are in the 
audience, and she also insists that what she calls her "separatist policy" is 
not a gimmick. 
</P>
<P>
"God, I hate that word," she winced. "It makes me a little uncomfortable 
because it didn't start out to be that. I would rather replace that word with 
'good idea.' " 
</P>
<P>
Jones' "good idea" started in October in London, Ontario, the town where Jones 
grew up as Jenny Stronski. Back home to visit and play the local comedy club, 
she convinced the manager to open on a Sunday for a women-only show, so she 
could use the stack of jokes that always bombed with men. 
</P>
<P>
He agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"We turned away 1,000 women that night," she said. "They were scalping 
tickets." 
</P>
<P>
She launched the evening with gags about stretch marks and PMS and, needing to 
fill a little time, opened the floor for what was to become the show's 
highlight: women's pet peeves. By January, Jones had designed a logo (the 
international "No" sign with a shapely leg crossing out a male's silhouette), 
and she was on tour with Girls' Night Out. A man protested the discriminatory 
ticket policy in Boston, but a legal stand-off was averted because the show was 
already sold out to women. In Denver, security guards were hired because of 
threatening phone calls to the box office. No trouble materialized. In Los 
Angeles, Ticket Master refused to sell tickets to her Feb. 20 show at Igby's 
until she removed the "No Men Allowed" banner from her signs. (No men showed 
up.) 
</P>
<P>
Jones said that without men, the show developed into a "pajama party"-type 
atmosphere. "It's not an anti-male show," she said. "We're just trying to let 
our hair down and talk about personal things that men don't get." 
</P>
<P>
She believes women wouldn't feel comfortable unless assured that there were no 
men in the audience. To do that, Jones conducts a "hairy knuckle" check at the 
beginning of each of her shows. 
</P>
<P>
"I just think the guys that try to cause the trouble are being very petty," she 
said. "We aren't the same, we are different. I think discrimination laws have 
gone way too far, with girls suing to be in the Boy Scouts and men suing to go 
to some women's gym." 
</P>
<P>
Jones balks at a question about whether she is a feminist -- "I hate labels" -- 
but said she thinks that issues such as whether women should be admitted to 
private mens' clubs have taken away from the unresolved objective of equal pay 
for equal work. 
</P>
<P>
She won't say exactly what she will do if men are sitting in the audience come 
Sunday at the Ice House. She's joked that she would perform in the ladies' 
room, and speculated during an interview that she might refund everyone's money 
and cancel the show. 
</P>
<P>
For all of her years on the fringes of show business, Jenny Jones at 43 still 
can seem like a 15-year-old harvest queen candidate who sees her big chance and 
doesn't want to blow it. 
</P>
<P>
"Am I OK? Too much? Too shiny?" she nervously frets after prepping for the 
photographer. And when the photographer packs his equipment to leave, she 
implores, "Pick one where my hair doesn't blend in the background. Where I look 
real pretty and intelligent." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Jones is pretty, and she does seem intelligent, not just in pictures. 
What she wasn't, for the longest time, was funny, she now admits. 
</P>
<P>
The "Star Search" victory opened doors, but she didn't get calls from People 
magazine, Time, "Inside Edition" and the Regis Philbin show until she barred 
the show's doors to men, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, her phone won't stop ringing, and she's handling it all without an agent 
or a manager, since she "cut them loose" when she decided to try her experiment 
with an all-female audience. 
</P>
<P>
"I tend to be influenced more than I should be," she explained. "This time, I 
just really wanted to go with my instincts." 
</P>
<P>
With one exception. 
</P>
<P>
Jones admits that she relies on the advice of fiance Denis McCallion, a film 
location manager, who offers an occasional joke for the show he's never seen. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure he'd like to be there," she said, "but I'm the boss and I say he 
can't come in."

She stands like a steel reed on the stage of the Bolshoi Conservatory, her tiny 
figure encased in gold lame, her mouth marked by a single streak of scarlet. 
Only her hands move, now flaying a violent chord, now lulling the violin almost 
to sleep. At intermission, the audience is ecstatic; fans rush the stage, 
shower her with flowers, even kneel at her feet and kiss her hand. At 
performance's end, after three encores, she is flooded with roses, tulips and 
carnations -- more than 50 bouquets in all. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no words to describe my feelings," Nina Beilina tells the packed 
audience filled with former students, youngsters, and middle-aged lovers of 
Beethoven and Mozart. Beilina means it. She isn't a Moscow regular but an 
emigre who left 14 years ago, thinking it was for keeps. Now, she is back and 
performing for the first time on the very stage that was closed to her in the 
1970s -- after all, she was a woman, a Jew, an outcast. 
</P>
<P>
Beilina, 50-ish and now a comfortable Manhattanite who teaches at the Mannes 
School of Music, is only one of dozens of exiled musicians, artists, writers 
and theater directors now traveling back to visit the audiences that they never 
meant to leave behind. Over the past two years, under Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
policy of glasnost, Moscow has allowed and even encouraged such visits. 
"Before, they considered us traitors, but now we are considered victims of the 
regime," said Beilina. 
</P>
<P>
The list reads like a Who's Who of Moscow: rebel writers Vladimir Voinovich and 
Vassily Aksyonov; outspoken theater director Yuri Lyubimov, who has not only 
visited but gotten back citizenship and his job as artistic director of the 
famous Taganka Theatre; dancers Rudolf Nureyev and Natalia Makarova; musicians 
Vladimir Ashkenazy, Mstislav Rostropovich and his wife, singer Galina 
Vishnevskaya, who recently toured Moscow and Leningrad with the National 
Symphony; sculptor Ernst Neizvestny, who once tangled with deposed leader 
Nikita Khrushchev over the meaning of art; and painter Mikhail Chemkyakin, 
whose works now fetch hundreds of thousands of dollars in New York and Paris. 
</P>
<P>
The current visits are the outgrowth of a trend begun in 1986, when a select 
few Soviet cultural figures with travel privileges began spreading the word 
abroad that major changes back home were paving the way for the resurrection of 
the Soviet Union's rich artistic heritage and the return of its living 
representatives. Those contacted early on included Rostropovich and 
Vishnevskaya, Lyubimov, Neizvestny and others. "They need people for 
agitational and propagandistic reasons," scoffed Lyubimov at the time. But the 
director, who defected in 1983 to escape artistic suffocation and -- like many 
other artists -- was later stripped of citizenship, lived to eat his own words. 
</P>
<P>
Little more than a year ago, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze announced 
that the "stigma of class enemy" should be lifted from Soviet emigres and visas 
should be issued to permit free travel in a campaign to improve relations with 
expatriates. For many, the offer was irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
After five years of difficult exile, during which Lyubimov divided his time 
between New York and Europe, he was invited back to Moscow in 1988 to direct 
productions of "Boris Godunov" and "Living," the latter his long-banned play 
about a peasant who runs away from a collective farm. His citizenship was 
restored several months later, in May of 1989, and in December he had back his 
old job as leader of the Taganka. Now he has a Moscow apartment but maintains 
dual citizenship -- Israeli and Soviet. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Voinovich, now living in Washington, was forced out of the country in 
1980 and stripped of his citizenship for the raucous and unorthodox lampooning 
of Soviet society in "The Life and Extraordinary Adventures of Private Ivan 
Chonkin," a banned novel that he sent to the West for publication. Now, the 
novel has been published in a Soviet journal with a circulation of 3.5 million 
readers. Unlike Lyubimov, Voinovich, Rostropovich and Vishnevskaya, he has not 
had his citizenship restored -- and because he considers it revoked illegally 
he will never ask. But ask him where, or how, he would prefer to live, and his 
answer is clear. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to live both here and there," he said. "My roots are there, my 
readers, my relatives, and my graves. It is my country and I never rejected my 
country." 
</P>
<P>
Sasha Sokolov, an acclaimed novelist best known for his "School for Fools," 
returned to the Soviet Union seven months ago after a 15-year hiatus. For him, 
being immersed back in his native language has been a boon: "After a while, 
something just wasn't right with my work. Gaps had developed." Only after 
arriving did he realize that what he was missing was everyday Russian speech. 
Now, he revels in it, lapping up the latest jargon and slang "as if I had been 
waiting for these expressions all along." An optimist who strongly endorses 
Gorbachev's reforms, Sokolov said his homecoming has been "like a dream, and I 
am afraid to be awakened." 
</P>
<P>
The reader is very important to the Soviet writer, said Benedikt Sarnov, a 
Moscow literary critic who writes regularly for the liberal weekly Ogonyok. 
This, as well as the Soviet state's heavy subsidization of culture, is 
reflected in the size of literary editions. While Western book runs are small 
-- maybe 15,000 copies for an "exotic" Russian novel -- Soviet editions come 
out in 50,000 or 200,000 at a time, said Sarnov. Unlike the West, where a 
writer must publish a book nearly every year to survive, in the Soviet Union 
the proceeds from a book can last a writer for two or three years. 
</P>
<P>
But for those who have successfully adapted to the West, a permanent return is 
practically impossible. "Their lives are torn in half; one part is here and 
another is there," said Sarnov. 
</P>
<P>
In many instances, Soviet emigres have grown accustomed to different work 
standards, and also naturally want to maintain a higher, Western standard of 
living. The politics of culture remains tenuous. Battles rage between 
virulently right-wing writers and more democratically minded authors. Last 
month, a meeting at the Central Writer's House in Moscow was broken up by a 
"mini-pogrom" led by members of the ultra-nationalistic, anti-Semitic 
organization called Pamyat. 
</P>
<P>
The recent experience of writer Andrei Sinyavsky, who drew the West's attention 
to the dissident movement in the mid-1960s with his imprisonment for publishing 
under a pseudonym in the West, shows that not everything has changed. Sinyavsky 
visited Moscow last January after an absence of 15 years. First, his visa was 
delayed until a day after the funeral of his friend and erstwhile co-author, 
Yuli Daniel, the reason for his visit. Throughout their stay, he and his wife 
were constantly followed and occasionally harassed. Then, on the way out, 
customs officials rifled through personal papers, address books, even his 
wife's undergarments. 
</P>
<P>
Voinovich, Beilina and the rest all worry about the wretched state of the 
Soviet economy and the indecisiveness of Communist Party leaders, about whether 
and how the precarious tightrope act to democracy can succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe my country will rise up after all, will no longer be a beaten slave," 
said violinist Beilina. She has traversed the darkness before, and, for the 
sake of the country she still considers her own, she is willing to risk it 
again. She is now talking with some Leningraders about teaching the violin 
there for part of the year. "If they make me an offer to come and do something 
-- I'll do it," she said.

KCBQ RADIO TO REUNITE VOICES FROM THE PAST

<P>
For a group of well-traveled disc jockeys, working in a business that is 
transient by nature, mention of radio station KCBQ evokes memories of a golden 
era, a time when they were No. 1 with a bullet. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the most special place I ever worked, by light-years," said Rich Werges, 
a.k.a. Rich Brother Robbin. "Asking a guy in his middle 40s about KCBQ is like 
asking about the '60s. I get all choked up." 
</P>
<P>
KCBQ achieved greatness -- industrywide recognition -- not once but twice. In 
the mid- to late 1950s, it was one of the country's first big rock 'n' roll 
stations, a pioneer of the music that swept the country. In the late '60s and 
early '70s, it was one of the last great AM music stations, a last hurrah for 
AM before FM music stations began to dominate the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, KCBQ-AM (1170) and KCBQ-FM (105.3) will bringtogether three 
decades of the station's personalities for an on-air reunion from 6 a.m. to 8 
p.m. They will broadcast from the Marriott Mission Valley, where marketing and 
promotional paraphernalia representing 35 years of the station's history will 
be on display. The public is invited, and a free "sock hop" will top off the 
day from 8 p.m. to midnight at the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1955, the Bartell radio chain purchased KCBQ-AM and switched it 
from traditional block programming -- an hour of country music, an hour of 
classic music, etc. -- to the music of hot youngsters such as Elvis Presley, 
</P>
<P>
and other pioneer rockers. It was one of the first rock stations in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Powered by the incessantly upbeat announcing of Ralph James, Don Howard, Jim 
O'Leary, Earl McRoberts, Jack Vincent and Harry (Happy Hare) Martin, the 
station soon became the most popular in the city, earning as much as 40% of the 
audience during some time periods, according to several surveys. 
</P>
<P>
Through much of the era, the disc jockeys worked in a glass booth in the El 
Cortez Hotel, where listeners could drive by and see them at work. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that it was as near to being at one with myself as I've ever 
been," said Martin, now an account executive with KSON and doing voice-over 
work. "Imagine going into a station knowing that everybody loved you and you 
were going in with a spoon to stir up that love." 
</P>
<P>
Station owner Lee Bartell gave the disc jockeys unprecedented freedom on the 
air, and they were known to take advantage of it. Among other stunts, Martin 
recalls running for mayor and staging Indian rain dances on the air. 
</P>
<P>
"I was being paid to be crazy, which saved me a great deal of trouble having to 
go in for therapy," said Martin, who left the station in 1962 for a lucrative 
offer in Cleveland, although he returned to KCBQ in 1969 to anchor the morning 
lineup for three years. 
</P>
<P>
James, who worked at KCBQ from 1955 to 1961, remembers that Bartell never told 
him not to do anything on the air. Despite the rowdiness, the emphasis was 
always on the positive and being upbeat and helpful to the community. 
</P>
<P>
The station called itself "family radio." 
</P>
<P>
"People often ask me what there was with KCBQ," said James, who went on to a 
successful career as one of Hollywood's most recognized voices. "To me, it was 
a very community-oriented station. We were ahead of our time. . . . The success 
wasn't so much the music but the guys who worked there and how they integrated 
themselves with the community." 
</P>
<P>
Although "The Q" was consistently a success, it didn't again approach the 
remarkable popularity of those first years until the late '60s and early '70s. 
Locked in a battle with the "Boss Radio" of KGB, KCBQ again concentrated on Top 
40 hits and the power of its on-air personalities to post double-digit ratings 
and again dominate the market. 
</P>
<P>
Again, the emphasis was on being friendly and upbeat, creating a family 
atmosphere among staff and listeners. 
</P>
<P>
"We frequently screamed but we always smiled," said Werges, who worked at the 
station in 1971 and '72, and again in '73 and '74, serving as program director. 
"It was always something that warmed the inside, was always 'up.' " 
</P>
<P>
Former KGB program director Buzz Bennett, a firm believer in positive thinking, 
directed the station through most of the successful years in the early '70s. As 
program director, he gave the staff books on self-motivation and regularly 
preached to them about believing in themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Things were loose and open, both on and off the air. One disc jockey even 
remembers the "I Ching" being consulted on a decision. 
</P>
<P>
Magic Christian, Rich Brother Robbin, Bobby Ocean, "Shotgun Tom" Kelly and the 
other KCBQ personalities became household names, as the station regularly 
posted audience shares of 20 and 30 rating points. In contrast, the top-rated 
station in San Diego for the past few years, KKLQ (Q106), usually earns a 9 or 
10. 
</P>
<P>
"We played the hits and only the hits," recalled Werges, now general manager of 
KQYT-FM, an easy-listening station in Tucson, Ariz. "It was like pulling teeth 
to get a record on the station." 
</P>
<P>
It was a heady experience for the disc jockeys, who could gauge the station's 
success every time they went out in public. Chuck (Magic) Christian recalls 
taking the station's dune buggy to the beach for a summer promotion and seeing 
waves of people flock to the water when the station announced his location on 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an unbelievable feeling that that many people listened to that much 
radio," said Christian, now doing morning shows for KLCY-FM in Salt Lake City. 
"I've never seen anything like it." 
</P>
<P>
For the disc jockeys, it was a 24-hour job; their identities both on and off 
the air were linked to the station. 
</P>
<P>
"You might play golf, or you might ride a bicycle for fun, but you worked for 
KCBQ," Werges said. "It was a privilege. . . . I was Rich Brother Robbin. It 
was everything." 
</P>
<P>
Werges left the station in 1974 because, he said, he was an alcoholic and 
"couldn't cope anymore." But, in some ways, he misses the glory days of KCBQ. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing can compare to it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the disc jockeys who worked at the station held a variety of jobs 
before and after their stints with KCBQ. It goes with the territory in the 
radio business, where careers are affected by ratings and the whims of 
management. 
</P>
<P>
"To this day, there are a lot of negative aspects in this business," Christian 
said. "But at least we were united in that one effort." 
</P>
<P>
By the late '70s, FM music stations began to dominate radio markets, and it 
took several years for KCBQ to adjust and establish its FM side. Though 
consistently successful, it has never achieved the success of the 
ground-breaking years of the '50s or the period in the late '60s and early 
'70s. 
</P>
<P>
The station has gone through several owners through the years, and for a period 
in the early '80s, it even switched to a country music format. It reverted to 
oldies rock in 1986. Currently both the AM and FM side feature oldies rock (the 
AM uses the syndicated KOOL format), playing many of the same songs it did in 
the station's heyday. 
</P>
<P>
In December, the station was purchased by Adams Communications, which decided 
to emphasize the station's history, dropping the "Eagle 105" moniker in favor 
of concentrating on the KCBQ call letters in all marketing campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
"They feel KCBQ are legendary call letters that people are familiar with 
locally and nationally," said station spokeswoman Leslie O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to James, Martin, Werges and Christian, the reunion is scheduled to 
bring back to the KCBQ airwaves such familiar names as Charlie Tuna, Jerry 
(Shadoe) Jackson, Dean Goss, "Shotgun Tom" Kelly, Jack Vincent, Charlie and 
Harrigan, Jerry G. Bishop and others. 
</P>
<P>
For the disc jockeys, it will be a chance to revive old acquaintances and, for 
some, to relive the good old days. 
</P>
<P>
"Harry Martin owes me a dollar and I'd like to collect at 10% interest each 
year," James said with a laugh. "I'd also like to see if Don Howard still looks 
as funny as he used to."

ROONEY FALLOUT: Don Hewitt, executive producer of "60 Minutes," said that he 
believes the suspension of commentator Andy Rooney, right, has hurt the show's 
ratings. "60 Minutes" was outperformed Sunday night by "America's Funniest Home 
Videos." 
</P>
<P>
It was only the second time in 12 years that the long-running newsmagazine had 
been beaten in its regular time slot by an entertainment program other than 
sports. In a memo Tuesday, Hewitt noted "60 Minutes' " surprising loss in the 
ratings and said, "What part the Andy Rooney affair played is anybody's guess. 
My guess is that it played a pretty big part. Be that as it may, Andy will soon 
be coming back."

ANDY ROONEY TO RETURN TO '60 MINUTES' 'SOON'

Executive producer Don Hewitt posted a notice on the bulletin board in the "60 
Minutes" offices Tuesday attributing the magazine's unexpected drop in the 
ratings this week in part to the absence of commentator Andy Rooney and saying 
that Rooney "will soon be coming back" to the CBS News program. 
</P>
<P>
The repeat of the special that launched "America's Funniest Home Videos," ABC's 
surprise new hit of the TV season, beat the perennially top-rated "60 Minutes" 
in the ratings on Sunday night, attracting 31% of the audience compared to CBS' 
27%. It was only the second time in 12 years that the long-running newsmagazine 
had been beaten in its regular time slot by an entertainment program other than 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney was suspended Feb. 8 for three months without pay for remarks about 
blacks and gays attributed to him in The Advocate, a Los Angeles-based gay 
newspaper. He acknowledged the comments about gays but denied making some of 
the statements about blacks. 
</P>
<P>
In his memo Tuesday, Hewitt noted "60 Minutes' " surprising loss in the ratings 
and said, "What part the Andy Rooney affair played is anybody's guess. My guess 
is that it played a pretty big part. Be that as it may, Andy will soon be 
coming back." 
</P>
<P>
"I have every reason to believe that a date has been set" for Rooney's return, 
Hewitt said later in an interview. "I don't know when that date is, but I 
believe that there is some sort of agreement for Andy to return gracefully that 
may have been worked out over the phone" between Rooney and CBS News President 
David Burke. 
</P>
<P>
Burke could not be reached for comment, and CBS News was making no official 
comment on talks about Rooney's return. But CBS News sources said that the 
70-year-old commentator could be back on the air as early as Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Burke and Rooney met last week to discuss Rooney's suspension. Rooney had hoped 
that he might be able to return to "60 Minutes" as early as last Sunday, 
according to sources, and had prepared a commentary in case he did.

OCC'S 'BOYS' LIFE' PROVES MERELY EXASPERATING

At one point in Howard Korder's "Boys' Life," Jack says he handles most of 
life's bumps by thinking of Ray Charles. Someone such as Ray would always be 
cool, always do the right thing, no matter what the dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
A nice role model, Ray Charles, but he would probably say "hit the road" to 
Jack and his pals for the way they behave, especially with women. Jack, Don and 
Phil, Korder's thin impressions of arrested male development fired by hormonal 
fuel, tend to do the wrong thing as they drink too much beer, smoke a lot of 
dope, joke about breasts and hit on most of the women they encounter. 
</P>
<P>
They're pretty silly, really, so it's hard taking them seriously. The thing is, 
Korder anxiously wants us to take them seriously. He wants us to see them as 
symbols of the male predicament. 
</P>
<P>
"Boys' Life," now in a wobbly production at Orange Coast College, is generally 
an immature play about immature men. Korder has shown that he can be an 
intelligent and dynamic writer -- his "Search and Destroy" had impact in its 
recent run at South Coast Repertory -- but this 1988 drama is often a shallow 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
You can see where Korder is trying to take "Boys' Life." Growing up to be a man 
is a tough business, with all that sexual conditioning to deal with. Should we 
be gentle, loving guys (as Don apparently chooses when he acquiesces to a 
normal life and gets married) or perfect heels? Hey, aren't men designed to be 
predators, or at least beasts? 
</P>
<P>
Jack (Sharr White) understands the irony too well. He's got a wife and a kid 
and an overcoat of cynicism that weighs him and everybody else way down. Jack's 
still attractive, though, so he has an easy time with women. He's just filling 
space; Jack hates himself, so he might as well take it out on others. 
</P>
<P>
Phil (Greg Guy) is a wimp, the opposite of take-charge, can-do Jack. He 
persuades women to sleep with him by whining. He lies to himself and to them. 
He's full of guilt for being such a weak creep. Phil should feel bad -- he 
actually has sex with a date while she is passed out, drunk. 
</P>
<P>
Don (James Rurup) is like Jack but he's also like Phil. He wants to take it 
easy and stroll through life. Responsibility is like grit in the bed for Don, 
until he meets a strong-willed sculptor. She helps him become an adult. Out of 
gratitude, or maybe fear, he decides to marry her. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of the time during "Boys' Life" you want to grab these boys by the collar 
and give them a shake. Hey, snap out of it! Come on, grow up! That's when it 
almost works. But the play doesn't take us further, we don't see where these 
three are going. They're exasperating, and so is "Boys' Life." 
</P>
<P>
At OCC, there's an air of appropriateness in having a college-age cast take on 
Korder's characters. The John Ferzacca-directed actors naturally convey the 
self-absorption inherent within the theme, but they don't fully evoke the 
roles' dimensions that might overcome some of the script's weaknesses. Too many 
single notes being played over and over again. 
</P>
<P>
The performances have consistency but not enough of the contradiction that 
should result when playing characters out of touch with themselves. Rurup, with 
his low-wattage, fairly internalized approach, comes the closest to embodying 
the paradox. 
</P>
<P>

It's Garry Shandling's Wrap: Saying that he wants to "explore new directions in 
my career," Garry Shandling confirmed Tuesday that he will fold "It's Garry 
Shandling's Show" this spring. The offbeat comedy series has been running on 
the Showtime pay-cable channel since September, 1986, and later was picked up 
for over-the-air broadcasts by the Fox network. The series will have completed 
72 episodes when it wraps production with a special "final" installment, and 
negotiations are under way to syndicate a rerun package. Beth Kleid

HOWARD ROSENBERG: STATIONS PULL OUT A TRUMP CARD -- AND LOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There must be a reason why America should so desperately care about the private 
lives and public machinations of Donald and Ivana Trump. None immediately comes 
to mind, however. 
</P>
<P>
Here, it seems, is the classic example of media creating a topic for discussion 
and then breathing so much hot air into their own fatuous creation that it 
takes on a blimpish life of its own. 
</P>
<P>
This is a Frankenstein monster, a non-story, an emperor preening without his 
clothes. More than anything, however, public discourse over the Trumps -- 
concerning who gets how many assets in the dissolution of a billion-dollar 
marriage that probably few Americans knew even existed until recently -- is a 
microcosm of the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
It's here. It's bigger than life. But why? 
</P>
<P>
Now c'mon. Before all of this was fattened into obesity by battling New York 
gossip columnists and then gorged on by newspaper and TV tabloids and 
ultimately the mainstream media, did you care? 
</P>
<P>
Most of us didn't even know the name of Trump's wife until a few weeks ago. Now 
we're supposed to be alarmed that she may be getting only $25 million or $50 
million from her macro-industrialist husband? This is a human rights issue? A 
feminist issue? A social issue? Ivana Trump, persecuted homeless person? 
</P>
<P>
Fight back those tears. 
</P>
<P>
Give her all of Manhattan if it will kill this trivia tapeworm that has invaded 
even the likes of news programs that define themselves as legitimate. Forget 
about "A Current Affair" or "Hard Copy" or "Donahue" or "Geraldo" or "Oprah." 
This was "PrimeTime Live" -- a production of ABC News -- that last Thursday 
opened with the Trumps tabloid style, a mocking treatment that at once 
ridiculed the story and feasted on it. To emphasize just how low "PrimeTime 
Live" and its anchors, Diane Sawyer and Sam Donaldson, had sunk, the Trump 
segment was followed by a tie-in piece about suffering divorcees that also 
could have played just as easily on one of the tabloids. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it was. 
</P>
<P>
The best thing that Erik Sorenson did after taking over the helm of "CBS This 
Morning" was to aggressively pursue Paula Zahn to replace Kathleen Sullivan as 
Harry Smith's co-host. Zahn started Monday. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't that Sullivan was all that deficient -- in fact, she'd grown in the 
job -- only that Zahn promises to be much better, based on her work as morning 
news anchor on ABC and earlier as news anchor on KCBS Channel 2. 
</P>
<P>
Here's some simple addition: Zahn plus Deborah Norville (who recently succeeded 
Jane Pauley on NBC's "Today") plus ABC's "Good Morning America" co-host Joan 
Lunden equals three blonds. A caller noted that fact recently, charging that 
the men who hire the talent at the big three networks favor dumb-blond 
stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps. In this instance, however, the charge doesn't fit, for Zahn has always 
projected an intelligence and sophisticated world awareness lacking in some of 
her counterparts, regardless of hair color or gender. 
</P>
<P>
Here is one show where smarts and likability coexist smoothly, as evidenced by 
holdover Smith and by Zahn's Monday debut, in which she capably handled the 
show's lead interview with former President Jimmy Carter on Sunday's Nicaraguan 
election. (Bryant Gumbel and Charle Gibson interviewed Carter on "Today" and 
"Good Morning America," respectively). 
</P>
<P>
Yet ratings are ratings, and morning shows are morning shows, so the key to 
Zahn's success or failure may not be her brains -- especially in light of 
Sorenson's background in local news -- but her ability to chat. 
</P>
<P>
If Zahn is Sorenson's best move, however, his worst is dropping Peter 
Bogdanovich, whose charming, wise and highly literate vignettes on movies were 
something to look forward to. 
</P>
<P>
Adding the thin and tepid entertainment reports of Channel 2's Steve Kmetko 
hardly fills that void, nor, likely, would signing movie critic Gene Siskel, 
with whom "CBS This Morning" has been negotiating. The major strength of 
"Siskel and Ebert" -- still by far the best of TV's movie review shows -- 
remains the chemistry between Siskel and Roger Ebert, not either as an 
individual. Although a great team, moreover, they always seem to sputter in 
national TV appearances beyond their syndicated series. 
</P>
<P>
So the verdict on Sorenson so far is one thumb up, the other down. 
</P>
<P>
Amazing, isn't it? With all the money they invest in their local newscasts, 
you'd think that KNBC Channel 4 and KABC Channel 7 could spare a few bucks for 
a dictionary. But nohhhhhh. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent night of ratings sweeps frenzy, Channel 4 introduced David 
Sheehan's interview with Tom Cruise as "exclusive" and Channel 7 introduced 
Gary Franklin's interview with Cruise as "exclusive." Astonishingly, these 
"exclusive" interviews of the same actor appeared on their respective newscasts 
simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
Cruise, shmuise, what does it matter anyway? It's not like getting an interview 
with Greta Garbo or something. But honesty should matter. 
</P>
<P>
Webster's New World Dictionary defines "exclusive" as: "Excluding or tending to 
exclude all others; shutting out other considerations, happenings, existances, 
etc." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the interviews were not "exclusive," but the introduction to 
each -- by excluding and shutting out consideration of a competing Cruise 
interview -- was carried out in an exclusive manner. 
</P>
<P>
Another definition also applies here, the dictionary definition of a lie: "A 
false statement or action, especially one made with intent to deceive."

'VIDEOS' TRIMS '60 MINUTES'

First Mike Tyson, now "60 Minutes"? CBS' popular news magazine did not win its 
time slot Sunday night, according to ratings released Tuesday by the A. C. 
Nielsen Co. Instead, a repeat broadcast of "America's Funniest Home Videos" 
from last November attracted the largest audience -- about 17.9 million homes, 
compared to about 15.4 million for "60 Minutes." 
</P>
<P>
ABC said it was the first time in 12 years that one of its entertainment 
programs had won in that Sunday 7-8 p.m. time period. NBC, meanwhile, took the 
overall viewing honors for the week with six of the 10 most-watched programs. 
The full list of ratings is on Page 9. 
</P>
<P>
* Despite the strong lead-in from "America's Funniest Home Videos," ABC's 
three-hour movie about the 1986 space shuttle disaster fared poorly. 
"Challenger" attracted 20% of the available audience (compared to the 31% that 
tuned in "Videos") and trailed not only the programming on NBC and CBS but also 
both "The Simpsons" and "Married . . . With Kids" on Fox.

Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, commonly called the Mormon Church.

The statement said it was "issued to Catholic clergy, religious and lay leaders 
working with Hispanics, Hispanics who no longer practice Catholicism, and 
leaders and members of sects and other religious groups."

The Rev. Ricardo Chavez, director of Latino affairs for the conference,

RECALL FAILURE CALLED SLOW-GROWTH WIN;

MISSION VIEJO COUNCILMAN WARNS FOES AFTER VICTORY

A day after he beat back a heavily financed campaign to oust him, City 
Councilman Robert A. Curtis warned his colleagues that he believes that he has 
a mandate from residents to pursue the slow-growth agenda that has frequently 
brought him into conflict with the council. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the tremendous support we've received in this election would 
convince the rest of the council that this community supports growth controls," 
Curtis said in an interview this morning. "If the three members of the council 
who have not been willing to listen to that message don't heed it now, then 
they'll simply have to stand for election on the basis of the issues, including 
their support for the recall." 
</P>
<P>
Curtis' remarks came in the wake of an overwhelming victory that he won in 
Tuesday's recall election. More than 33% of the city's voters cast ballots in 
that contest, and Curtis won by a margin of more than 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was all the more stunning because recall proponents raised more 
than $500,000 to defeat the councilman. Curtis raised less than $50,000 in his 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said this morning that the Mission Viejo Co., the major 
financial backer of the recall, made several 11th-hour contributions to the 
campaign. Although final disclosure reports have not yet been filed, the 
company's recorded contributions to date top $300,000, including more than 
$150,000 in the final two weeks of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis' colleagues, two of whom openly opposed him in the recall campaign, said 
they hoped his threats to retaliate in November would subside with time. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand how Bob and his supporters feel right now," said Mayor Christian 
W. Keena, who endorsed the recall last week. "Bob and I are not going to be 
friends, but the voters didn't elect us to be friends. They elected us to work 
together for this city, and I hope we'll be able to." 
</P>
<P>
With all 37 precincts reporting, 8,679 voters rejected the recall to 3,835 who 
voted in favor. Slightly more than 33% of the city's registered voters cast 
ballots, election officials said.

A second suspect has been arrested in the Palmdale kidnaping of a savings and 
loan officer who was held captive in her home for 36 hours last week before 
being rescued at her Newhall branch office during a failed robbery attempt, Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Deputies said today. 
</P>
<P>
Tyrone McGraw, 29, described as a transient from the Pomona area, was arrested 
Tuesday night after deputies pulled him over in the 3600 block of Colorado 
Boulevard in Pasadena for driving without license plates and headlights, 
sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
A check of the vehicle's identification number revealed that the red Toyota he 
was driving had been reported stolen in the Newhall robbery attempt. 
</P>
<P>
McGraw was booked on suspicion of robbery, grand theft of an auto and giving 
false information to police officers. He was being held without bail in the 
Temple City Sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
An alleged accomplice in the Feb. 23 kidnaping and robbery attempt, Brian Keith 
Simms, 29, of Duarte, was arrested when he attempted to flee.

Culminating a two-year investigation, the California Highway Patrol today 
announced the arrest of 31 people linked to alleged fraudulent auto insurance 
claims that paid the suspects more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The case, which involves the alleged staging of vehicle collisions to look like 
accidents, is believed to be the largest in Orange County history, the CHP 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Nine insurance companies were allegedly victimized, and some of the people 
arrested were employees, said Dan McNerney, deputy Orange County district 
attorney. There were no claims for personal injury, just for damage to 
vehicles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation was headed by officers in the CHP's Santa Ana headquarters 
and included two other Southern California regional offices of the CHP, the 
officer said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects were arrested Tuesday, and their arraignment was scheduled today 
in Orange County Superior Court.

PRESSES FOR CONTRAS TO DISBAND

<P>
President Daniel Ortega today ordered a unilateral halt to all offensive 
military operations and said the U.S.-supported Contra rebels should disband so 
Nicaragua can peacefully change governments. 
</P>
<P>
Late Tuesday, President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro also told the 
Honduras-based rebels to lay down their weapons immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"The causes of the civil war in Nicaragua have disappeared. There is no reason 
for more war," the leader of the National Opposition Union said in a radio 
address. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his press office, Ortega said the unilateral halt to 
military activity is aimed at encouraging the 10,000 Contras to demobilize 
quickly and quietly. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega also urged the Honduran government to dismantle Contra base camps near 
the Nicaraguan border and asked the Bush Administration to end all U.S. aid to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Secretary of State James A. Baker III told lawmakers today that 
conditions for the Contras' safe repatriation were "rapidly being created." 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged the bitterness arising from the prolonged guerrilla war but 
said: "This issue can be resolved, and we think it will be resolved. The war is 
over in Nicaragua." 
</P>
<P>
The Contra war against the Sandinistas, who came to power in a July, 1979, 
revolution, has claimed 30,000 lives. The rebels' refusal to lay down arms has 
been an obstacle to regional peace initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
In Honduras today, rebel spokesman Alejandro Acevedo said the Contras had 
informed Chamorro's UNO that they hope to meet soon about disbanding, although 
they would prefer to remain a fighting force to ensure that Ortega steps aside. 
</P>
<P>
"Without us here, there is no one to insist that Ortega step down," he said. 
"But under the right conditions, we would demobilize sooner." 
</P>
<P>
Honduran President Leonardo Callejas this week said the opposition's victory in 
democratic elections in Nicaragua means that the Contras should leave promptly. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that Nicaragua is "in a period of political transition" but 
said, "The insurgent forces of the Nicaraguan counterrevolution should not 
continue on our national territory." 
</P>
<P>
The Sandinistas and the Contras had agreed on a cease-fire in early 1988, which 
was later extended. But the Sandinistas lifted it last Nov. 1, after a spate of 
Contra attacks. 
</P>
<P>
The war, and the accompanying economic devastation, played a large part in 
popular discontent and contributed to the Sandinistas' election defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Five Central American presidents called last August for dismantling the rebels, 
but the Contras had been able to resist such moves because Washington 
maintained humanitarian aid until the elections. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has said it will soon lift its economic sanctions 
against Nicaragua and grant financial aid to the new government. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Havana's first official comment on the Sandinista defeat, Cuban 
Vice President Carlos Rafael Rodriguez today said the defeat of the Marxist 
Sandinista's "hurt . . . but does not humble" Cuba.

The sister of the longest-held Western hostage in Lebanon said today as she 
ended a pilgrimage to Europe and the Middle East that she believes the 
atmosphere is right for the release of all 18 captives. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that this is the beginning of the end," said Peggy Say, sister of 
Terry Anderson, 42, chief Middle East correspondent of the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
"It might not happen tomorrow, it might not happen next week, but when it 
happens, I believe it's going to be all of them, and I would rather see all the 
hostages come out next month than see Terry Anderson come out today alone," 
Peggy Say told British Broadcasting Corp. television. 
</P>
<P>
Say is especially optimistic because she believes that for the first time since 
Anderson was seized nearly five years ago, the three key nations -- the United 
States, Syria, and Iran -- are working together to try to free the hostages.

A woman passenger aboard United Airlines Flight 123 spotted smoke in the cabin 
today, panicked, pulled open an emergency exit and began an evacuation down a 
chute while the plane was still at the terminal, the airline reported. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 of the 167 passengers aboard the DC-8 slid down the chute onto the 
Tarmac at Orlando International Airport, said Sara Dornacker, a United 
spokesman in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The rest walked off the plane through the jet way in an evacuation by flight 
attendants, Dornacker said. 
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries and there was no fire, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Dornacker said what the passenger saw was smoke from an overheating 
air-conditioning unit, something she described as "not that uncommon." 
</P>
<P>
The flight to Chicago and San Francisco was canceled so the chute could be 
replaced.

About 27,000 gallons of heating oil poured into a busy waterway near Exxon 
Corp.'s Bayonne terminal this morning as it was being loaded onto a barge with 
a hole in it, the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 6 heating oil was discovered leaking about 4:20 a.m. into the Kill Van 
Kull, a major route for barge and tanker traffic that separates Bayonne from 
Staten Island, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Jeff Crawley, a Coast Guard spokesman, said the oil poured through a 
12-by-6-inch hole and forced the closing of the busy waterway. 
</P>
<P>
Crawley said he didn't know what caused the hole in the barge. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard said the heating oil was an Exxon product, but Louis Jung, a 
spokesman for Exxon's Bayway Refinery in Linden, said he did not know who owned 
the oil. 
</P>
<P>
The barge owner, Ekolof Marine of Staten Island, N.Y., had two environmental 
cleanup companies at the scene this morning, laying containment booms.

A 5-year-old boy who drank 10 ounces of bourbon after an adult allegedly

life support systems, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Griffin died at Cook-Ft. 
</P>
<P>
Worth Children's Medical Center about 8:45 a.m. The respirator supporting the 
youngster's breathing was disconnected Tuesday night, but the child had 
continued to breathe on his own. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the boy was given the alcohol at a party Friday night and "told to 
drink it like a man." 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Jimerson, 21, was being held in Tarrant County Jail in lieu of $100,000 
bail after being charged with injury to a child. 
</P>
<P>
The boy was taken to the hospital Saturday afternoon after he went into 
convulsions. At one point, the boy's blood-alcohol level was about .55%. 
Doctors said he would probably have suffered irreversible brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
At the time the boy drank the liquor, Jimerson was visiting the apartment of 
Thomas' mother, Patricia Griffin, 31.

USX Corp. plans to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review an appeals court's 
ruling that the company discriminated against 8,000 black job applicants at a 
steel mill, a spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court last week upheld a 1983 U.S. District Court decision for the 
second time. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court last year ordered the appeals court to restudy the case under 
more stringent standards for proving bias that the high court imposed June 5. 
</P>
<P>
USX spokesman Ernie Glenn said the company will seek a review of the U.S. 3rd 
Circuit Court of Appeals ruling on the ground that the appeals court misapplied 
the Supreme Court's new interpretation of civil rights law. 
</P>
<P>
The June 5 decision said minorities could not rely solely on statistics to 
prove discrimination but must link the data to a specific corporate employment 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
The decision also let companies justify practices that statistically appear 
discriminatory by showing they followed a reasonable employment policy.

Britain announced monthly trade figures today that were much worse than 
expected, as the country's trade deficit more than doubled in January over the 
prior month. 
</P>
<P>
The data showed the deficit on the current account, the widest measure of 
Britain's foreign trade, was $3.16 billion, more than double a revised 
$1.37-billion gap for December. 
</P>
<P>
Economists had been forecasting a current account deficit of around $2.2 
billion for January. 
</P>
<P>
The Central Statistical Office said Britain's monthly current account figures 
are proving erratic and suggested that trends over three months give a more 
accurate picture. 
</P>
<P>
The office attributed the size of the January gap to a deficit in several 
volatile items where a small surplus would have been expected. This reflected 
large diamond imports and smaller aircraft exports than had been predicted, it 
said.

EDDIE MURPHY SUED FOR ALLEGED THEFT OF SCRIPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MINEOLA, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Long Island man filed a $35-million suit Tuesday alleging a screenplay he 
wrote was stolen by actor-comedian Eddie Murphy and used as the basis for the 
film "Harlem Nights." 
</P>
<P>
The allegations come a month after Paramount Pictures lost a similar suit filed 
by writer Art Buchwald, who charged Murphy stole one of his stories and used it 
as the basis for the 1988 film "Coming to America." 
</P>
<P>
In the suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Uniondale, Hempstead resident 
Michael Greene said his agent, who works for the William Morris Agency, asked 
him in 1988 to "write a property for Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor." 
</P>
<P>
Greene, 35, said he submitted the screenplay, titled "A Halloween to Remember," 
but the William Morris Agency rejected it without returning the copies of the 
screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
Greene said he began to hear rumors that the script for "Harlem Nights" bore a 
strong resemblance to his screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy could not immediately be reached for comment on the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Les Fagen, an attorney for Paramount Pictures in New York, said: "We have 
reviewed Michael Greene's screenplay and also the screenplay from 'Harlem 
Nights,' and we find no similarity and no basis for the lawsuit." 
</P>
<P>
Greene, who has been writing screenplays for 16 years without selling anything, 
said, "You work for a break all your life, and then someone steals your work." 
</P>
<P>
In January, Paramount Pictures lost a breach-of-contract suit filed by 
Buchwald, 64, a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist. Buchwald said the movie 
company stole his story, titled "King for a Day," and turned it into Eddie 
Murphy's 1988 film "Coming to America." 
</P>
<P>
Buchwald is seeking $5 million in damages and a second trial is scheduled in 
Los Angeles Superior Court to determine how much he can collect. 
</P>
<P>
Greene's attorney, Steven Legum, said both Greene's screenplay and "Harlem 
Nights," whose author is listed as Murphy, "start with an 8-year-old boy who is 
orphaned and raised by underworld characters." 
</P>
<P>
"The scene of both screenplays is Harlem, and both have a corrupt Italian 
police officer," Legum said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not saying that the two scripts are identical," he said. "Clearly there 
have been changes, but some of the similarities are nothing less than 
mind-boggling." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the $35-million compensatory figure named in the court papers, Legum 
said the amount of damages Greene could be awarded would be based on the 
earnings from "Harlem Nights." 
</P>
<P>
"The film has grossed $70 million," Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
Named as defendants are Murphy, Paramount Pictures Corp., William Morris 
Agency, Eddie Murphy Productions and Steven J. Weiss, the agent who asked him 
to write the screenplay for Murphy.

COLD WAR FUELS HEAT IN 'HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER COPELAND, SCRIPPS HOWARD NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the final scene of the movie "The Hunt for Red October," CIA Agent Jack Ryan 
turns to Soviet Capt. Marko Ramius and says, "Welcome to the new world, sir." 
</P>
<P>
In that brief moment, the Cold War book by Tom Clancy tries to become a 
post-glasnost movie, and it sounds just like George Bush welcoming Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev into the family of nations. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind the scene was preceded by two hours of good, old-fashioned Cold War, 
with dogma-spewing commissars pitted against CIA agents who love their kids, 
and chain-smoking, sweaty Russian fanatics battling cool-headed "ring knockers" 
from the U.S. Naval Academy. 
</P>
<P>
Ramius (Sean Connery), commander of the Soviets' newest submarine, called Red 
October, is running from both the U.S. and Soviet navies and threatens to bring 
the two countries to war. 
</P>
<P>
But forget the politics. It's time for action, and "Red October" fires a 
broadside. Opening Friday, "Red October" is high-tech, underwater adventure -- 
a kind of sea-soaked "Star Trek." 
</P>
<P>
The underwater scenes even look like outer space; the dark sea is filled with 
particles that twinkle like stars. The subs, which in real life handle like a 
Coupe DeVille skidding across a frozen pond, move in the film with the speed 
and grace of the Starship Enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
The big boats are lovingly photographed from every angle, in dry dock and at 
sea, usually accompanied by loud, ponderous music that makes the subs seem even 
more ponderous. 
</P>
<P>
How much did the Navy pay for this two-hour recruiting ad? If you can believe 
it, the producers actually paid the Navy $325,000 for fuel and other expenses 
incurred during shooting. 
</P>
<P>
The last Hollywood hit to become a recruiting aid was "Top Gun," which made 
heroes out of Navy pilots. As if in revenge, "Red October" features only three 
fliers: one brags about how airsick he gets, another is a wimp who wants to 
abort a mission and the third crashes into the deck of an aircraft carrier. 
</P>
<P>
The CIA also gets good publicity. Ryan (Alec Baldwin), far from the 
stereotypical psycho-killer CIA man favored by Hollywood, is "just an analyst" 
who can practically read the mind of Ramius. 
</P>
<P>
Which brings us back to politics. With relations warming between the United 
States and the Soviet Union, "Red October" will seem quaintly out of date to 
those who already are spending their "peace dividend."

PRODUCERS SUE TO BLOCK SAG TAKEOVER OF L.A. EXTRAS' GUILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers has asked a federal 
court to bar the Screen Actors Guild from taking over representation of 
Hollywood extras, court papers revealed today. 
</P>
<P>
A suit filed in Los Angeles on Tuesday claims that SAG's proposed takeover of 
the Screen Extras Guild's union jurisdiction violates SAG's agreement with the 
producers' association. 
</P>
<P>
SAG agreed in its 1989 contract with the producers "that it no longer has 
jurisdiction over extra work" performed in and around Los Angeles County, 
according to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
The takeover would cause "substantial and irreparable injury" to the producers' 
association, and the court should issue an injunction barring it from taking 
place, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
SAG spokesman Mark Locher said SAG officials had not seen the producers' suit 
and could not respond to its charges. 
</P>
<P>
Although SAG represents both actors and extras nationwide, extras in the Los 
Angeles area have been represented by the Screen Extras Guild since 1945, 
Locher said. 
</P>
<P>
But that guild has fallen on hard times, Locher said. He said it has been 
unable to negotiate and enforce its contracts with producers and has been 
unable to pay dues to the Associated Actors and Artists of America, the parent 
organization of the two unions. 
</P>
<P>
At a January meeting of the parent organization, officials of the extras' guild 
sanctioned the proposed takeover. Since then, SAG members have approved the 
takeover overwhelmingly in a mail-in vote.

Paul Newman's legal rematch begins with jury selection next Wednesday in 
Bridgeport, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
The actor and businessman is being sued by Westport deli owner Julius Gold, who 
wants a share of Newman's food business because he claims he helped develop it. 
The first trial, which featured testimony from Newman himself, ended in a 
mistrial in 1988 after jurors were inadvertently given documents that had been 
ruled inadmissible. Newman denies that Gold helped develop his salad dressing 
or that he was promised a cut of the Newman's Own company profits. Newman 
donates profits from his food business, which also includes popcorn and 
spaghetti sauce, to various charities.

Actor-director Ron Howard joined his neighbors fighting the installation of a 
microwave radio tower on the grounds of a closed school. 
</P>
<P>
Howard, 36, known for his roles on television's "Happy Days" and "The Andy 
Griffith Show," said microwave transmissions from the 180-foot tower at the 
Parkway School could harm children if the school ever reopened. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of physicians I talked to said, 'You better be careful,' " Howard 
said at a town meeting Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Town officials say they need the tower to improve radio communications for 
police and fire departments.

A former mayor says he rues the day he dedicated a city park in the name of 
Kirk Douglas, who described Amsterdam as a "dirty mill town" in his 1988 
autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
"I will go to my grave regretting my part in putting a park in his honor here," 
said Mario Villa, a city ward supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Douglas Park was dedicated in a 1985 ceremony attended by Douglas and 
thousands of well-wishers, including Villa, then mayor. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Ragman's Son," Douglas says his neighbors in the town near Albany 
discriminated against him when he was growing up here because he was the son of 
poor Russian Jewish immigrants. Douglas claimed that he was beaten and denied 
jobs because he is Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
Villa said the claims of discrimination were false, and he decried Douglas as 
"nothing but a hollow, phony individual" with little concern for his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas' book already had drawn criticism from residents of this town of 
22,000. In a letter recently to The Recorder, the daily newspaper in Amsterdam, 
Douglas refused to retract anything he wrote.

<P>
Davis, who injured his left knee earlier this month, practiced vigorously

<P>
"It feels good," Davis said. "I'm going to play Saturday -- at least I hope

Davis is required to miss five games after being put on the injured list. He 
would be eligible to return against Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Davis is Denver's top perimeter shooter, averaging 18.3 points per game. The 
Nuggets are 18-8 when Davis makes at least 50% of his field-goal attempts.

SACRAMENTO DISMANTLING RAIDER OFFER; 
</P>

FOOTBALL: THE CITY COUNCIL HAS GIVEN RAIDERS MANAGING GENERAL PARTNER AL DAVIS 
UNTIL MIDNIGHT TONIGHT TO AGREE TO MOVE HIS TEAM.

<P>
The Sacramento City Council began dismantling its $50-million offer to bring 
the Raiders to California's capital late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted to yank its bid off the table if Raiders managing 
general partner Al Davis has not agreed by midnight tonight to move his team to 
Sacramento. Davis called Mayor Anne Rudin earlier this week to say he probably 
would not make up his mind by the city's deadline. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave him ample opportunity. If he didn't avail himself of it, we're going 
to do other things with this money. We're not holding it out for him," Rudin 
said after the council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The city intends to spend the money it raised for the Raiders on municipal 
building projects during its annual budget hearings in May and June. Although 
the money will sit in a bank until then, Rudin said it cannot be used to pay 
the Raiders to move to Sacramento unless the City Council changes its mind. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Davis) is out of luck. It's too late for public money," she said. 
</P>
<P>
During a 2 1/2-hour discussion of the deal late Tuesday, the council voted to 
postpone collecting a new 5% tax on tickets to entertainment events until July, 
1991, and to consider repealing a 1.5% increase in the city's hotel tax in 30 
days. 
</P>
<P>
Both taxes were passed by the City Council last September to help pay for 
$40-million in bonds sold to finance the Raiders' fee. The city is under 
pressure from the hotel industry and the entertainment industry to repeal the 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The council also voted to collect nearly $304,000 from the Sacramento Sports 
Assn., an investment group headed by developer Gregg Lukenbill that was 
organized to bring professional football and/or baseball to the capital. The 
money will be used to recoup city expenses on the bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
Davis has been listening to offers from Sacramento and Oakland because he is 
dissatisfied with the Los Angeles Coliseum Commission's failure to improve the 
stadium. He has also discussed keeping the club in Los Angeles if the Coliseum 
is renovated. 
</P>
<P>
If the Raiders move, it will be their third home since 1982, when the team 
moved from Oakland to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Without the city-backed relocation money, Lukenbill's chances of landing the 
Raiders will fade compared with proposals by Oakland and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Lukenbill, owner of the NBA Sacramento Kings, did not attend the council 
meeting, but he said earlier this week that he was pessimistic about 
Sacramento's chances with Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's just basically blowing us off," Lukenbill said. "It's hard for me 
to believe that, but that's what it seems to me." 
</P>
<P>
Rudin said the efforts to land the NFL franchise were like "chasing an 
illusion" and predicted that the city would not offer to spend public money to 
land a professional football or baseball team without having voters approve the 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to put up public money to get another sports team here. We're 
going to ask the community. If it is a great deal, the community and the 
private sector should put up the money," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not willing to go though all this again," she said. "To spend our time -- 
our staff time, our own time and energy, and our money -- chasing an illusion 
just doesn't make sense."

The International Olympic Committee has ordered a study of prospects for 
readmitting South Africa to the games after reforms in apartheid, the IOC 
president said in an interview published today. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Antonio Samaranch told the Italian sports newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport 
that the African Olympic Assn. has been asked to report on the problem after 
consulting sports associations representing every race in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"We were the first sports organization to close the door on segregationist 
South Africa in 1970. Now we note the changes there and we would be truly happy 
one day to be the first to open that door. But to do this we need the advice 
and approval of African countries," Samaranch said. 
</P>
<P>
Samaranch also said he has invited East European Olympic associations and 
sports ministers to IOC headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, on April 21 to 
discuss the effect on sports of radical political changes in their countries. 
</P>
<P>
Samaranch, commenting on the rapid political changes that are taking place in 
the world, said that communist nations in Europe and Latin America have used 
sports for propaganda but that this is changing fast. Now, he said, they are 
moving toward sports for the masses. 
</P>
<P>
"But I believe that these ex-communist countries will still succeed in 
achieving good results in the Olympics or world championships because they have 
a tradition," he said.

Like most people who live in a fog, former New England Patriots' Coach Raymond 
Berry never saw his firing coming. 
</P>
<P>
Bulwarked by faith and blinded to the reality that his last two Patriots teams 
were only slightly more appetizing than last year's yogurt, Berry was ready to 
stay the course, even as it became obvious he had no map or chart to guide him, 
only a mystical inner compass that he could not or would not explain. Even as 
he believed he had the Patriots pointed magnetic north, they were headed south. 
</P>
<P>
At his final news conference, Berry said "This all comes as news to me" when 
asked about "philosophical differences" with General Manager Pat Sullivan. How 
typical. Berry could sit face-to-face with Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev for six hours, and it would be news to him that the guy has a 
birthmark. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, Berry's career is proof of The Peter Principle, the former No. 
1 best seller in which the author argued that sooner or later, given 
opportunity, most people reach their level of incompetence. 
</P>
<P>
With the Baltimore Colts from 1955 to '67, Berry was the greatest pass-catcher 
in the game. Five years after he retired -- the earliest date a player becomes 
eligible -- he was inducted into the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
But as the Patriots' head coach these last 5 1/2 years, Berry, 56, has been a 
puzzle, a space cowboy whose ability to speak gobbledygook and ignore reality 
first confounded the media, then his players, and eventually, the front office. 
</P>
<P>
To the end, many players liked Berry, but that isn't to say that he was doing a 
good job. Most players tend to like any coach who doesn't yell and get on their 
case constantly. 
</P>
<P>
What did Berry do for the Patriots? At first, very little. Which was exactly 
what was needed. When the team was at its peak in back-to-back 11-5 seasons, 
writers shrugged if, in the heat of the postgame dressing room, Berry couldn't 
remember the name of the next opponent or answered questions about that day's 
game as if he'd been stuck in line at the concessions stand. 
</P>
<P>
So he seemed a bit goofy. So what? The team was winning and the veterans stuck 
up for him. 
</P>
<P>
Just as the Boston Celtics, relieved to be rid of the iron hand of Bill Fitch, 
took first-year head Coach K. C. Jones to the NBA championship, so did the 1985 
Patriots take Berry to the Super Bowl. Berry succeeded Ron Meyer, who also had 
ruled with an iron hand. Like K. C., let's credit Berry for not messing them 
up. 
</P>
<P>
But who completely messed up the quarterbacking? Who cost the Patriots a 
playoff spot in 1988 by starting a rusty, surgery-scarred, gun-shy Tony Eason 
in the final two games when he hadn't played in the first 14? Who firmly 
installed Eason as his starter before the 1989 season even began, then yanked 
him after three games and demoted him all the way to fourth-string, ruining his 
market value and setting the stage for Eason's total humiliation when the 
Patriots waived him at midseason? 
</P>
<P>
The way Berry mishandled the quarterback situation was grounds for firing all 
by itself. 
</P>
<P>
What about his sophomoric play-calling? Trailing 7-0 in the first quarter 
against Dan Marino and the Dolphins early this season, Berry called for a fake 
punt, even though the Patriots were deep in their own territory and in 
immediate danger of falling behind 14-0 if it failed. Which is exactly what 
happened, as the Patriots went on to a resounding defeat. Afterward, Berry said 
that even if the Patriots had been on their 1-yard line, "I would have called 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Uncompromising? Yes. And just plain stupid. 
</P>
<P>
As was Berry's protecting of older players like Stanley Morgan, Steve Grogan 
and Marc Wilson in the Plan B draft -- guys who almost certainly would not have 
been signed by other teams -- and letting younger players go. 
</P>
<P>
Berry said the season-ending injuries to Garin Veris, Ronnie Lippett and Andre 
Tippett in the final exhibition game against the Green Bay Packers and a 
general decline in talent -- an indirect swipe at the departed (to the New York 
Jets) Dick Steinberg's scouting operation -- had more to do with the Patriots' 
poor season than anything else. 
</P>
<P>
There is some validity to that. But there is less validity in keeping a coach 
who lives in his own little world, who explains nothing, and who expects 
people, even his bosses, to trust him while his uninspired team sinks into 
mediocrity -- and below.

Why Wont Ya took the lead in the stretch and went on to post a half-length 
victory in the $81,800 Night Styles Final for fillies and mares at the 
Meadowlands on Tuesday night. Bill O'Donnell drove the 4-year-old daughter of 
No Nukes to a 1:57.1 mile over a fast track. Modern Day Lady closed for second.
