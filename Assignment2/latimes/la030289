STROKE OF BAD LUCK FOR CORONADO: CLERK DOESN'T TYPE OR COMPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMANDO ACUNA, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Coronado has a problem: Ed Wienecke can't type a lick or work a computer, and 
he has no intention of learning how. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that Wienecke is the new city clerk, and in Coronado the city 
clerk is responsible for recording the votes and preparing the minutes of the 
City Council for posterity. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't want to be a typist. I didn't run to be a typist," says Wienecke, 
an affable 69-year-old retired Air Force military judge and contracting officer 
who was elected to the clerk's job in November. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he wants the city to hire him a permanent deputy, sort of a glorified 
secretary who would handle the typing, a task as traditionally bound to the 
clerk's job as hammering is to carpentry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Excedrin Headache No. 800' 
</P>
<P>
As might be expected, the council is months behind in its minutes, a situation 
that has some council members in a tizzy. Mayor Mary Herron said of the entire 
matter, "It's Excedrin headache No. 800." 
</P>
<P>
Some, such as the local weekly newspaper, contend that the problem is of the 
council's own making. After the previous city clerk, Tom Patricola, who was on 
the job for more than 20 years, retired in 1987, the council decided it was 
time to redefine the post. 
</P>
<P>
With many of the clerk's former duties, such as preparing agendas and other 
clerical work taken over in recent years by two city employees, the council 
sought to make the city clerk both a part-timer and a council appointee, rather 
than an elected official. 
</P>
<P>
Coronado voters, however, prevented that last June, when they turned down the 
council and decided to keep electing the clerk. So the council was left with a 
part-time clerk whom it couldn't choose or control. 
</P>
<P>
Into the political void entered Wienecke, a former lieutenant colonel and 
two-year resident of Coronado who beat two other contenders last fall and was 
elected to a four-year term. The stripped-down job, which the council continued 
tinkering with into September, was left with only a few responsibilities, 
including the state-mandated task of keeping a book of local ordinances, 
maintaining the city seal, running elections and, not least of all, keeping 
council minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Wienecke just assumed he would have a helper, someone to handle the tedious 
chore of preparing council minutes, while he devoted himself to more weighty 
matters such as "records management." 
</P>
<P>
"But I found out I didn't have one," he said ruefully. 
</P>
<P>
At his first council meeting, Wienecke found out what being Coronado city clerk 
was all about. The meeting droned on for 6 1/2 hours, he said, the politicians 
making their speeches and lodging their votes. But he was slipping, and fast. 
</P>
<P>
"It was chaos, but no one knew that but me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the work was just beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, the meeting took me 60 to 70 hours to complete," said Wienecke, who 
is paid $75 a week. "I didn't have any idea what to expect. I didn't have (a 
previous) incumbent to tell me. I went in cold." 
</P>
<P>
Luckily for Wienecke, the council meeting is routinely taped for broadcast on 
the local cable company's public access channel, and is also taped separately 
for sound. Using his VCR, Wienecke has been able to slowly piece together the 
meetings. (Wienecke, incidentally, has also contended that attending council 
meetings isn't part of his duties.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bureaucratic Sing-Song 
</P>
<P>
The result is a bureaucratic sing-song: If the minutes aren't late, then they 
are wrong and unacceptable to the council. 
</P>
<P>
By the middle of last month, it was clear to Wienecke and the council, which 
also works part time and whose members also receive $75 a week, that something 
had to be done to end the lack of a legal historical record, which was 
threatening to snuff out democracy in the placid bayside city of 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
Wienecke asked the council for $500 a month until June to hire a helper who 
would compile the minutes. City Manager Homer Bludau didn't like the idea. He 
asked Wienecke to take typing lessons, but Wienecke declined. 
</P>
<P>
"The long-term solution is that he learn to type or find a way to do the job," 
Bludau said. "He doesn't feel he ran for city clerk to do this kind of work." 
</P>
<P>
The council in mid-February approved the allocation, and Wienecke has hired a 
woman in San Diego prepare the minutes. She relies on the broadcast tapes that 
Wienecke provides her. Wienecke says he is almost caught up now, although the 
council has yet to approve any minutes for this year. 
</P>
<P>
What happens after the money runs out in June, no one knows. Wienecke just this 
week put in a budget request for about $20,000 to hire a deputy city clerk. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they should hire one. I want a full-time deputy," he said. "I want to 
get involved in ordinance indexes and resolutions . . . records-management type 
of things." 
</P>
<P>
Wienecke, a former commissioner of beaches in Los Angeles, says he has visited 
almost all of the other city clerks in the county and that none have to work 
under his conditions. There's an election in Coronado on Tuesday to fill a 
vacant seat on the council, and Wienecke says that, as the town clerk, he is in 
charge of organizing it, though the bulk of the work will be done by the county 
registrar of voters. He's had to communicate with the registrar's office by 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no one here to type a memo to the registrar for me. I can't type a 
memo," he said. "This really is a Mickey Mouse operation." 
</P>
<P>
Whether that's true or not, Mayor Herron said much of the clerk's burden has 
fallen on other city workers. 
</P>
<P>
"It falls on the shoulders of our city staff. What we have is a clerk in the 
city attorney's office who gets them (minutes) in draft form," she said. "A lot 
of people are picking up the work." 
</P>
<P>
"The job is different than what he thought," she said. "He expected to be part 
of the political debate and interface with other agencies. But it's not like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Some council members, such as Herron and Lois Ewen, are reluctant to spend 
money to hire a full-time helper for Wienecke. "When we made the changes (to 
the clerk's post), we felt a skilled technician was needed," Ewen said, adding 
that Wienecke "has other skills, but none of those happen to be typing." 
</P>
<P>
"This is something that is taking a lot of our time and taking us away from 
more pressing issues, such as traffic," she said. 
</P>
<P>
One other thing: Wienecke recently asked the council to pay his way to Nova 
Scotia to attend an international convention of municipal clerks. The council 
said no, explaining that it had approved a policy last May not to pay for trips 
outside the United States. Wienecke thinks maybe the council is trying to tell 
him something.

3 MIGRANT FAMILIES GO FROM HOOCHES TO JACUZZI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paloma Rodriguez stood in the kitchen of her modern Carlsbad apartment, looking 
into an empty living room, and exclaimed, "All of this is either a dream or a 
miracle; maybe a little of both." 
</P>
<P>
It was understandable that Rodriguez and her family felt as if they were living 
a dream. Twenty-four hours earlier, her family was living next to a county 
landfill, in a crude third-world-like hooch made of scrap wood. The dirt-floor 
shack and others like it housing migrant workers were built against a canyon 
wall, among the sagebrush and manzanita. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Comfortable Apartments 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, her husband, Lorenzo Santos, and their three sons had lived as 
squatters in Encinitas for more than 18 months. But now, with the help of the 
some North County church leaders and other supporters, her family and two 
others will live in a comfortable apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Guadalupe Mojica Elizondo, Ruben Pina, and their two sons have run open-air 
restaurants in migrant camps since coming from Mexico five years ago. Now, they 
can cook for themselves on a gas range in a kitchen that has more modern 
conveniences than the family knows how to use. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Zavala and her husband, Rutilio Fuentes Sanchez, from El Salvador, have 
lived in the North County migrant camps eight months. 
</P>
<P>
Because the three were the only families left in the camps, the North County 
Chaplaincy made finding shelter for them a priority. At one time there were as 
many as a dozen families living in the largest of the camps. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, all of the families and others were forced out of the Valle Verde 
migrant camp -- situated on a ridge across El Camino Real from La Costa -- by 
county health officials, who declared the camp a health hazard and ordered it 
closed after many citizen complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, several dozen migrants moved a few miles south to the landfill, 
where they built new plywood shacks and A-frames covered with plastic sheeting. 
However, it took neighbors less than a month to pressure the county health 
department and Encinitas city officials into closing down the new camp. The 
migrants, who were told the camp was about to be closed, left the site on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Modern Amenities 
</P>
<P>
But, for the three families, the eviction from the canyon happened on the same 
day that the North County Chaplaincy, an interfaith denominational group 
devoted to aiding migrant workers, found each of them apartments in the same 
complex in Carlsbad, complete with a Jacuzzi. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the families were getting acquainted with the modern amenities 
that many Americans take for granted, like a dishwasher, bathtub, thermostat, 
oven and a gas fireplace. But, for the moment, each of the apartments is 
without furniture. The migrants, including Maria Zavala, who is eight months 
pregnant, are sleeping on the carpeted floor. 
</P>
<P>
"We're sleeping on the floor but we're in a real home. . . . Last night the 
kids ran all through the apartment, touching walls, flipping switches and 
opening doors," said Rodriguez. She noted that each of the two bedrooms is 
bigger than the primitive shack that housed all five of them. 
</P>
<P>
The gas fireplace, complete with fake logs, was of particular interest to 
Rodriguez's precocious 5-year-old son, Jairo. Minutes after occupying the 
apartment, the youngster flipped a switch and jumped in terror when flames 
began licking the fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
"He came running, yelling, 'Momma, fire comes out of the hole in the wall,' " 
said Rodriguez, laughing. "We used firewood for cooking when we lived in the 
wilderness. These logs light without matches and don't burn." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, the family bathed in an outside shower with cold water before 
they were driven to their new home. Little Jairo was still shivering from the 
previous night's shower when he awoke Wednesday morning on the floor of the 
family's new home, Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'World Was Crumbling' 
</P>
<P>
Jairo and his 7-year-old brother, Antonio, had never been in a bathtub until 
they walked into their new bathroom. Rodriguez said she put the two boys in the 
tub and turned the water on. 
</P>
<P>
"They were amazed that the water was hot. They played in the tub for almost an 
hour before I finally pulled them out," said the laughing mother. 
</P>
<P>
For Rodriguez and her husband, who hail from the interior of Mexico, their new 
living quarters were a godsend. 
</P>
<P>
"Our whole world was crumbling around us on Friday, when we were evicted from 
the camp. . . . But, all of a sudden, it was as if God intervened and said, 
'All of you have suffered enough,' and found these three apartments for us," 
said Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
The three apartments are within 30 feet of each other, in a complex that 
includes a mixture of races and ethnic groups. The families are being housed 
under a federal program that requires them to pay 30% of their net income for 
housing while the government subsidizes the rest. 
</P>
<P>
The adults in two of the families have qualified under the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service's amnesty program, while Zavala's husband, who is from 
El Salvador, has applied for political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
More than anything, the decent housing affords Rodriguez hope. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that we live in a real house, I'm going to send my children to school. I 
want them to better themselves so they can have a better life than what we have 
given them so far. But, if they grow up to have good educations and good jobs, 
I want them to always remember when we lived in the wilderness. That's nothing 
to be ashamed of. . . . We are poor but honest and do the best with what little 
we have," Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, whose hands and face reveal the hard life she has known, looked in 
wonderment at her modern kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
"They tell me that this is a dishwasher," she tells a visitor. "Tell me, is it 
true that it washes dishes automatically? Will you show me how it works?" 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, she burst out laughing and turned toward her husband. The couple's 
oldest son, Jose, 15, went to San Diego with a friend on Friday and does not 
know of the family's new home. 
</P>
<P>
"We better call his friend and tell him where we live," she said. "Otherwise, 
Jose is likely to go to our old home and not find us. He'll think that the 
migra has arrested and deported us to Mexico. Wait until he sees this place, 
even if it is without furniture. He'll think that we're rich now."

BILL WOULD BAN ZOO ELEPHANT RIDES, LIMIT DISCIPLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislation that would ban elephant rides at zoos, circuses and carnivals is 
being prepared at the request of Sen. Dan McCorquodale (D-San Jose), chairman 
of the Senate Natural Resources Committee, as part of a comprehensive bill 
dealing with the handling of captive elephants. 
</P>
<P>
The ban, believed to be the first in the country, will be considered March 9 at 
a meeting of a task force formed by McCorquodale after an elephant-beating 
incident at the San Diego Wild Animal Park last year. 
</P>
<P>
McCorquodale also has asked the legislative counsel to draft language that 
would make it illegal to discipline an elephant by using electricity, depriving 
it of food, water or rest, or in any way that damages, scars or breaks its 
skin. The bill also would make it a violation of the Penal Code to discipline 
an elephant by inserting any instrument into any bodily orifice, according to a 
letter McCorquodale sent to Legislative Counsel Bion Gregory. 
</P>
<P>
McCorquodale plans to introduce the legislation some time this year, but it is 
unclear whether the final version will include the ban on rides, according to 
an aide to McCorquodale who asked not to be named. The aide called the proposed 
ban "very preliminary." The task force, an advisory group that includes zoo 
officials and animal rights activists, will be asked for comment on the bill at 
the meeting in Sacramento next week. 
</P>
<P>
Strong opposition from zoos throughout the state is expected. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't think of any other spot in the world where it's against the law to 
ride elephants," said Jeff Jouett, a spokesman for the Zoological Society of 
San Diego, said Tuesday. "Elephant rides are one of the most popular 
attractions. They're a rare opportunity for people to come into contact and 
appreciate the animals in a very special way. Rides are a part of elephant 
history and something that has happened for thousands of years." 
</P>
<P>
California zoos may coordinate a protest of the proposed ban for presentation 
at the task force meeting, Jouett said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big Money Maker 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 156,912 elephant rides were given at the San Diego Zoo by a private 
contractor, netting the zoo $80,020, Jouett said. The Wild Animal Park, which 
uses its own elephants, gave 60,571 elephant rides in 1988, bringing in 
$106,000, he said. The Zoological Society operates both the park and the zoo. 
</P>
<P>
Elephant rides also are "extremely popular" at the Los Angeles Zoo, according 
to Ed Alonso, animal collection curator there. The rides "give another 
dimension to the public understanding of elephants," Alonso said. "They've been 
domesticated for a number of years." 
</P>
<P>
The push for the ban on elephant rides comes from animal rights advocates on 
the task force who allege that excessive discipline is required to make 
elephants docile enough to safely carry children. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing I have against (rides) is they're the first step toward making 
elephants circus animals in the zoo," said Cleveland Amory, head of the New 
York-based Fund for Animals and a member of McCorquodale's task force. "We have 
to stop all these stupid tricks and standing on drums." 
</P>
<P>
Elephants are so "brow-beaten" in the process of training for rides, Amory 
said, "that, by the time it's over, they're not elephants any more, they're 
large zombies." 
</P>
<P>
"They say they have to beat them to protect the keepers, well they have to beat 
them all the harder to protect the public," Amory said.

WAREHOUSE JOBS LET DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED GO TO WORK ON THEIR DREAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don Andersen dreams of being the drummer for the heavy-metal rock group Bon 
Jovi. Before that, though, he wouldn't mind having a girlfriend, his own 
apartment and a four-wheel-drive truck, not necessarily in that order. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of all," he said, "I like heavy metal. And I know I'd be good at it." 
</P>
<P>
The hard-hatted Andersen sometimes moves heavy metal as a warehouse employee of 
the Assn. for Retarded Citizens-San Diego. Along with 11 other developmentally 
disabled workers, he reports to work about 9 a.m. Monday through Friday and 
works until mid-afternoon in a Santee storeroom that is as conspicuously clean 
as it is friendly -- because of the men (and one woman) who haul the crates, 
drive the forklifts and ferry books from platform to truck. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Comes With the Territory 
</P>
<P>
Bob Christiansen, a large man with shaggy hair, a Falstaffian beard and a tiny 
earring, is the warehouse supervisor. He has no training as a counselor, but 
that comes with the territory in a job like this. The people who work here -- 
and who resent being called mentally retarded -- often pour their hearts out to 
Christiansen. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell a story about working here?" he said. "An anecdote? Wow . . . where would 
I start?" 
</P>
<P>
What workers often tell Christiansen is what anyone might share with a friend 
-- problems with girlfriends, with Mom and Dad, with money. He listens and 
tries to help, but mostly, he said, his role in this 9,000-square-foot building 
is to ensure that stock is moved from here to there, regardless of who moves 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The Assn. for Retarded Citizens-San Diego recently received a $250,000 contract 
from the Putnam Publishing Group to provide warehousing and storage, pickup and 
delivery and myriad other functions for its Tuffy Book division. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Luers, ARC operations coordinator, said that this was hardly unusual, and 
that large corporations nationwide are turning more frequently to the 
developmentally disabled to handle such jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"We've proven ourselves to the business community," he said. "We have contracts 
with a number of large companies. We do work with the government, with 
irrigation companies, with building contractors. We're more than two decades 
old, and we're a nonprofit organization. We have ARCs all over the country, but 
San Diego has the biggest in the nation because it has more chapters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Basic Goal 
</P>
<P>
"Our basic goal is to train the client -- the developmentally disabled person, 
as we call them -- to perform jobs well enough to be integrated into the 
employment sector in the outside world," Luers said. 
</P>
<P>
Kimberly Smith, director of vocational services for ARC-San Diego, said eight 
centers throughout the county offer on-the-job training in a work environment. 
Some centers offer work that is more basic; warehouses, such as the one in 
Santee, serve a "higher-functioning person -- those who can manage their own 
money, live on their own and then cope in the outside world," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In the past seven months, eight clients have been referred for outside 
employment, Smith said. Usually they end up in fast-food outlets, as janitors 
in hospitals or dishwashers in restaurants. She said 1,400 "clients" are served 
by ARC-San Diego, which also owns a doughnut shop and will soon open its own 
cafe in North Park. Many of the workers are part of the maintenance crew at Sea 
World, she noted. 
</P>
<P>
Christiansen was working as a truck driver for the doughnut shop when he heard 
of the warehouse opening. He took it eagerly, but said he sometimes finds the 
job stressful because the work is hard and because he often is a father figure 
for the high-spirited crew he commands. 
</P>
<P>
"The clients here are good," he said. "They're real high-functioning. When we 
get going, these guys can really turn and burn. The guys here are some of the 
hardest-working people I know. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Just Like a Daddy' 
</P>
<P>
"What really feels good -- what feels great -- is a job well done. We got 
jammed solid this week with big containers, new books from the Orient. We moved 
almost all of 'em. That feels good. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, though, I'm just like a daddy. These guys get into petty squabbles 
sometimes. Maybe they're playing around, and one guy gets mad. Somebody starts 
throwing stuff. Between the phone ringing and the fax machine spitting and 
these guys cutting up, well, sometimes it just piles up. But most of the time, 
these guys are great. They move it." 
</P>
<P>
Christiansen said he's never met people with a better attitude, that payday is 
like a pep rally. The workers clap and dance and cheer -- over money that 
ranges from 87 cents to $2.52 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"These people have goals and dreams," he said. "They want to be independent. 
They want a life of their own, just like we all do. They want to feel happy and 
loved." 
</P>
<P>
Ray Lopez, 32, is considered one of the better workers. Christiansen said the 
sadness of training someone well and having them become proficient is that he 
loses his best people. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez was loading books ("Peter Rabbit's Big Adventure") into a box and talking 
about the labels that society has chosen to stick him with: "I don't really 
feel" developmentally disabled, he said. "I don't feel that we're disabled. I 
feel I'm just a normal person." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hardest Day in His Life 
</P>
<P>
He said the hardest day in his life, the saddest, was when he left his family 
to venture out on his own. Now, however, they've adjusted to his being away, 
and he wouldn't trade anything for independence. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel success in so many ways," Lopez said. "I've never had this much go well 
for me. Now I have a lot more to look forward to in my future." 
</P>
<P>
Don Andersen, his buddy, lives in a group home in East San Diego but dreams of 
the day he can be on his own -- and live with the love of his life. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, if she was nice and she was cute and she would be nice to me and I would 
be nice to her, that would be great," Andersen said. "I can't think of anything 
I'd like more. Before I came here, I never thought of having dreams like that."

BUILDER MAIN DONOR TO GROUP BACKING LAKE MIRAMAR PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Scripps Ranch community group spent more than $457,000 -- $400,000 of the 
total contributed by BCE Development -- to oppose a rival group's bid to block 
development of the hills north of Lake Miramar, according to campaign finance 
reports made public Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The reports show that the Committee to Protect Your Community, which supports 
BCE's city-approved plans to build 3,360 homes on 1,200 acres north of the 
lake, raised virtually all of the money from BCE and other development firms. 
</P>
<P>
The organization spent the funds gathering more than 52,000 signatures in 
support of the project and opposing a rival group's effort to gather enough 
signatures to force a citywide referendum. 
</P>
<P>
The total is about four times the amount that Bob Dingeman, chairman of the 
Committee to Protect Your Community, told reporters that his group had raised 
during the January campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the money was spent to hire a professional petition-gathering firm, to 
mount a citywide telephone campaign and to pay for public relations work and 
direct-mail literature. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the rival organization, the Save Miramar Lake Committee, gathered 
about 45,000 signatures, nearly 20,000 more than needed to force a citywide 
referendum. The group, which has not yet filed a disclosure form, spent about 
$20,600, said its co-chairman, J. Gary Underwood. 
</P>
<P>
The Save Miramar Lake Committee is opposed only to the 658 homes planned for 
the slopes north of Lake Miramar. 
</P>
<P>
BCE has filed a lawsuit in Superior Court claiming that the petitions are 
invalid. A hearing on a temporary injunction in the matter is scheduled for 
Tuesday.

WIDOW OF FISHERMAN LOSES CASE AGAINST NAVY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN MAREE SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A U. S. District judge Tuesday ruled against a woman who claimed that Navy 
munitions were responsible for the 1986 shipwreck that killed her husband and 
his first mate off San Clemente Island. 
</P>
<P>
"The court finds this (an explosion) is a possibility on the basis of 
testimony, but a possibility is not proof by a preponderance of evidence," said 
J. Lawrence Irving, who heard the case without a jury. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$6.5 Million Was Sought 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Reber filed a $6.5-million suit against the government after the bodies 
of her husband, Boyd Reber, and his first mate, Frank Germano, were found, 
their boat demolished. Reber and her attorneys charged that the Navy was 
responsible, either through an errant missile fired during shore-bombardment 
exercises or unexploded ordnance Reber may have picked up in his net. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd Reber was found dead March 2, 1986, and Germano the next day. They had 
been fishing for soupfin shark since Feb. 21 near Mail Point and dragging nets 
along the bottom of the ocean, where unexploded Navy ordnance is believed to 
rest. The area in the southern part of the island is used for the bombardment 
exercises. 
</P>
<P>
Irving said that, because of the lack of evidence in the case, he based his 
decision on the evidence presented by underwater explosives expert Robert 
Short, a civilian consultant for the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
Irving said Short's testimony suggested that an underwater explosion would have 
left wreckage in a fairly small area. Wreckage from the boat, the Cindy Fay, 
was found partly on the beach of San Clemente Island near Mail Point; the rest 
was found about 1,000 feet offshore. 
</P>
<P>
After the ruling, Barry Capello, attorney for Cynthia Reber, said Irving 
ignored a portion of Short's testimony when he agreed that, if a huge wave were 
ruled out as the cause of the Cindy Fay's destruction, an explosion was the 
only alternative. 
</P>
<P>
An oceanographer from Scripps testified during the trial that a wave massive 
enough to destroy the Cindy Fay could not have existed in that area that day. 
It was estimated that it would have taken a 27-foot wave to swamp the boat. 
</P>
<P>
Capello alleged that two Navy destroyers, the Fife and the Elliot, were firing 
Feb. 25 and could have accidentally hit the Cindy Fay, but because the exact 
time and date of the death of Reber and Germano are unknown, "The court feels 
this is pure speculation," Irving said. "We don't know when this accident 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
During the course of the trial, Capello also alleged that Coast Guard and Navy 
officials were involved in an effort to cover up the incident by bungling their 
investigation and disposing of needed shipwreck evidence. 
</P>
<P>
In his ruling, however, Irving said there was "no credible evidence to support 
that." 
</P>
<P>
The ruling directly followed closing arguments given by Capello and Assistant 
U. S. Atty. Warren A. Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
In his argument, Capello said the Navy has admitted there is live ordnance in 
the water but makes no effort to adequately warn civilians about the dangers of 
bombardment activities, as evidenced by one fisherman who testified he was 
awakened Feb. 25, 1986, by Navy ammunition exploding around his boat. 
</P>
<P>
Another fisherman told a Coast Guard investigator that he pulled Navy ordnance 
from the waters in his net but then told Capello he would deny it and perjure 
himself rather than risk the possibility of having the area closed to 
fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
"It is clear from the evidence before you that unexploded ordnance . . . exists 
at or near the point where the Cindy Fay was destroyed," Capello told the 
judge. According to explosive experts who testified, the wreckage of the Cindy 
Fay showed clear evidence of an "explosion of high explosive nature," Capello 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But, in his closing statement, Schneider argued, "Nobody knows what happened to 
the Cindy Fay; nobody ever will know what happened to the Cindy Fay. The 
evidence is based on surmise with very limited facts." 
</P>
<P>
The theory that a Navy missile may have overshot the island and hit the Cindy 
Fay "contradicts testimony presented by naval personnel involved," Schneider 
said. "There is nothing in the record to indicate this testimony is erroneous." 
</P>
<P>
Capello said he will appeal the ruling.

TACOMA TO TAKE BACK CINDY, AN ALBATROSS OF AN ELEPHANT FOR PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zoo officials in Tacoma, Wash., are making plans for the return of Cindy, a 
4-ton Asian elephant once characterized as America's most dangerous, who did 
little to diminish that reputation during seven years at the San Diego Wild 
Animal Park. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy will return to the Point Defiance Zoo by fall after leaving the Wild 
Animal Park, where last month she broke the collarbone of one of her keepers 
with a slap from her trunk. 
</P>
<P>
The contract between Port Defiance and the Wild Animal Park expired in 
December, but Tacoma officials said that, before the construction of a new 
$1.5-million elephant center, they lacked the expertise and the facilities to 
handle Cindy. 
</P>
<P>
The center apparently can't open soon enough for Wild Animal Park officials, 
who have had their fill of 24-year-old Cindy. 
</P>
<P>
Though Cindy has a history of attacking keepers at the park, officials say she 
is no more of a problem than some of the other Asian elephants, which tend to 
be aggressive toward each other rather than their keepers. Park officials have 
told the Tacoma zoo that they would like to get rid of Cindy as soon as 
possible because she has failed to be mounted by a bull and is using space that 
could be occupied by a willing female. 
</P>
<P>
"We had expressed a desire to move her months before" the Jan. 31 attack, park 
spokesman Tom Hanscom said Wednesday. "We want to make sure she gets a proper 
home that can handle her. She has already become a headline subject." 
</P>
<P>
Two days after the incident, U. S. Department of Agriculture officials 
investigated and concluded that Cindy had attacked the keeper without 
provocation. She has since been kept with the park's lone Asian bull to isolate 
her from the remaining eight Asian cows and the keepers. Hanscom said Cindy is 
known to like only one of the park's six keepers in the Asian elephant yard. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy, whose species is endangered, has never mated. In explaining her 
anti-social behavior and fear of bulls, zoo and park officials cite her early 
years in isolation in Tacoma. Officials there said they considered using 
artificial insemination to produce offspring during her time there. 
</P>
<P>
The new elephant complex at the Point Defiance Zoo will include a "squeeze 
cage," a hydraulically operated device in which Cindy can be immobilized while 
keepers handle her, officials said.

RECYCLING EXPANDS INTO NORTH CITY WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego's voluntary recycling program will expand Saturday to include North 
City West residents, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,100 households that separate newspaper, aluminum, steel and glass into 
different containers will have their disposables picked up once a week along 
with regular trash collection. 
</P>
<P>
The program has been particularly effective in University City, where it began 
as a pilot project in October, 1988, according to Waste Management Department 
spokeswoman Marlene Mariani. Residents there have a 90% participation rate, the 
highest of any voluntary program in the nation, Mariani said. 
</P>
<P>
About 80 tons of recycling material are collected from University City each 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Because North City West has similar demographics, authorities expect the 
program to be equally successful there. The recycling program was expanded in 
January to include College Grove, which also generates about 80 tons of 
recycling material a month. 
</P>
<P>
"Residents are extremely supportive of the program. We are getting positive 
feedback from the participants as well as other residents requesting curb-side 
recycling in their communities," said Ernie Anderson, deputy director of the 
city's Waste Management Department.

ABORTION CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recently there has been media coverage of "Operation Rescue" and much 
commentary concerning the anti-abortion vs. pro-choice issue. 
</P>
<P>
In this day, with so many contraceptive methods available, why must we as a 
society be making such widely diverging choices? 
</P>
<P>
It should be every woman's right to choose what happens to her body. However, 
how can we take life so casually? And it will be life if given the chance to 
grow. It seems too cold, too inhumane, casual and irresponsible to take a 
position that "if I become pregnant I can always just end it." 
</P>
<P>
So much heartache has been caused by unwanted pregnancies, yet we as women 
never seem to learn the age-old lesson. 
</P>
<P>
Why not a new commitment to responsibility, to the use of contraceptives, to 
cherishing life rather than what seems to be a very sad prevailing attitude 
that shows a great sickness within our society.

In your article you discussed the new wave of Soviet immigrants coming to 
settle in Los Angeles (Part I, Feb. 19). The nonprofit agency which I direct, 
United Community and Housing Development Corp., has been actually involved in 
placing both Soviet Jewish and Armenian immigrants in "on-the-job-training" 
positions where they can transform their skills, background, and training to 
the American way of being employed. 
</P>
<P>
We also have offered "English as a second language," classes on a technical

L.A. TEACHER SALARY DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to Frank del Olmo's column "Who Gains if UTLA Alienates the 
Parents?" (Op-Ed Page, Feb. 15), I say, what a shallow analysis, premised on a 
false assumption! 
</P>
<P>
The current labor dispute between United Teachers-Los Angeles and the Los 
Angeles Unified School District isn't interfering with the education inner-city 
parents want their children to get. Education is proceeding as if the teachers 
had a contract. 
</P>
<P>
So far only the families of teachers observing the boycott of certain 
"non-academic" duties have suffered financially, because of docked paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
I can't see how teachers can be painted as selfish and shortsighted when we put 
our livelihood on the line every year to reach a fair settlement -- not just 
for ourselves, but also for the students. 
</P>
<P>
The public should keep in mind that poor working conditions for teachers mean 
poor learning conditions for students, and that low pay equals low morale and 
mediocre performance. 
</P>
<P>
The battle for good education is led by the teachers. We pay the price every 
year through stressful and bitter negotiations, only to have oversimplistic 
analyses like Del Olmo's paint us as cynics. 
</P>
<P>
When teachers across this country are paid their comparable worth, boycotting, 
slow-downs and strikes will be a thing of the past. 
</P>
<P>
If we treasure our kids, we should pay teachers commensurate to the social 
value they represent. Short of that, I'll stand by the union.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The grieving father and boy friend of slaying victim Anne Swanke testified 
Wednesday in the murder trial of David Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
Their testimony was limited to the last time they saw Swanke, 22, of San 
Carlos, alive and about when she failed to return home after visiting her 
boyfriend Nov. 19, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, 33, of Spring Valley is charged with kidnaping and murdering Swanke 
after she ran out of gas at 1:45 a.m. at Jackson Drive and Fletcher Parkway in 
La Mesa. Her body was found in a remote area of Spring Valley on Nov. 24, 1984, 
with her throat slashed. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas is also charged with murdering five other people and the attempted murder 
of a seventh person, all of whom had their throats severely cut. 
</P>
<P>
John Swanke, a philosophy professor at the University of San Diego, where his 
daughter was once an honor student, told the jury how she failed to come home 
after seeing her boyfriend, Greg Oberle. 
</P>
<P>
Swanke also identified pictures of his daughter's 1974 Dodge Colt, which was 
found abandoned with her keys, flashlight, valuables and gas can nearby. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with KFMB-TV (Channel 8) in the courthouse hallway, Swanke said 
coping with his daughter's death, even after four years, was "an extremely 
difficult situation." 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to have had this (the trial) over in a year," he said. "We really 
can't bury the girl until this is resolved." 
</P>
<P>
Lucas is also charged with killing Rhonda Strang, 24, and a 3-year-old girl, 
Amber Fisher, she was baby-sitting in Lakeside on Oct. 23, 1984; Gayle Garcia, 
29, on Dec. 8, 1981, in a home she was showing to prospective buyers in Spring 
Valley; and Suzanne Jacobs, 31, and her 3-year-old son, Colin, on May 4, 1979, 
in Normal Heights. 
</P>
<P>
The case's key witness against Lucas, Jodie Santiago, 33, of Seattle, will 
testify soon in the trial, which started Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago has identified Lucas as the man who kidnaped her from an El Cajon 
restaurant in June, 1984, and left her for dead in Spring Valley, after cutting 
her throat.

L.A. TEACHER SALARY DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In my experience with the public schools, teachers have been talented, 
dedicated and caring. I've come home from working in my children's classroom 
for four hours, exhausted in awe of the teacher's skill and ability. 
</P>
<P>
But the pesky teachers want more money! How dare they ask for a wage that is 
comparable to the work they do! Of course, no one would just give it to them! 
They have to apply pressure. Because of this, they are accused of being 
selfish, not doing their duty, neglecting the children. It's interesting to me 
that whenever a traditionally female profession demands a fair wage, the word 
selfish gets thrown around. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers are expected to uphold standards of excellence and professionalism and 
be satisfied with low salaries. If they are not content to work for the joy of 
it and little else, people like Del Olmo make accusations of selfishness and 
shortsightedness. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers that I have observed are not selfish. If they were, they'd be in 
another profession. It is we who are shortsighted. If we expect to attract 
quality people to teach our children and keep the ones we have, then we must 
pay them a decent wage. You do get what you pay for.

The California condor egg laid by a condor hatched in captivity is believed to 
be infertile but will be kept in an incubator for two more days in case it 
shows signs of embryo development, officials at the San Diego Wild Animal Park 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Don Sterner, the head condor keeper, said the 9 1/4-ounce egg was candled 
Wednesday and showed no signs of development, and he held little hope it would 
prove fertile. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, the egg will be kept in the incubator until it is a week old 
before a final conclusion is reached. 
</P>
<P>
The egg was discovered Friday morning, and was laid by Almiyi, who was hatched 
at the Wild Animal Park nearly six years ago. Condors, however, are not usually 
sexually mature until age 7. Officials nonetheless hailed Almiyi's egg laying, 
calling it "a behavioral milestone" because it showed that condors hatched in 
captivity and never exposed to the wild will still reproduce. 
</P>
<P>
Almiyi's egg was one of three that arrived at the Wild Animal Park last week. 
An egg laid Feb. 21 at the park by a once-wild condor called UN1 was declared 
fertile Monday, and a chick is expected within two months. It will be a sibling 
of Molloko, also bred by UN1 and AC4 at the Wild Animal Park and the first 
California condor conceived in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
A second egg, laid at the Los Angeles Zoo on Feb. 20 and shipped to the Wild 
Animal Park for incubation, was found to be infertile because its breeding 
partners, both taken from the wild, were sexually immature.

Six of your readers flailed away at Michael Novak for daring to defend the 
unborn (letters, Feb. 18). The writers ignored the central factor of the whole 
equation of life -- the existence of God and his guiding hand in the concerns 
of men and women. The old bromide that the end justifies the means is not valid 
today, yesterday, or a thousand years hence. A baby, fetus, blob (you name it) 
is already part of the human family and we cannot with impunity deliver it over 
the clinics of death. 
</P>
<P>
Facts are stubborn things but we have fiendishly clever people who can weasel 
their way around almost any obstacle such as "Thou shalt not kill."

ABORTION CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The issue is not pro-life or pro-choice; abortion is as old as the species and 
will continue until its extinction, regardless of the current sound and fury. 
The issue is whether or not all women who are faced with this dilemma will have 
access to a safe, inexpensive procedure in the most therapeutic of medical and 
social conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The actions and words of those who would deny them this clearly demonstrate 
that they have no interest in the fetus, the woman, or society. Their purpose 
is to impose their beliefs on the rest of us. That cannot be allowed to happen.

A CASE FOR AIDS TEST AFTER A NEEDLE-STICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NEIL SCHRAM, Neil Schram, MD, is a member of the California Medical Assn. 
AIDS Task Force. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A resolution will be presented to the California Medical Assn. Saturday urging 
the association to seek legislation that would allow involuntary testing of a 
patient for the AIDS virus following an exposure of a health-care worker to the 
patient's blood or other similarly infectious fluid. Since this proposal 
involves involuntary (mandatory) testing, many people will reflexively debate 
it as an issue of patients' versus health-care workers' rights, and that is 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Discussions about any form of involuntary testing invariably lead to intense 
emotional debate. This occurs because most mandatory testing proposals are 
clearly punitive in nature -- a deliberate attempt to punish infected 
individuals for being infected. However, the relationship between the 
health-care worker and the patient is not adversarial but rather is one of 
mutual caring. The usual logical and valid arguments against mandatory testing 
must be addressed. But because of the relationship between patient and 
health-care worker we must recognize what is most fair: We must see this as a 
situation where the safety of health-care workers must be protected without 
adversely affecting patients. With well-thought-out and carefully drafted 
legislation, that can be done. 
</P>
<P>
Mandatory testing of people for evidence of infection with the human 
immunodeficiency virus is generally opposed for three reasons: the behaviors 
that most commonly result in infection are consensual; there is no proven 
treatment to prevent infection, and fear of mandatory testing will usually 
convince the people most likely to be infected to stay away from testing 
situations, like premarital tests. 
</P>
<P>
The situation of an accidental needle-stick, the most common source of a 
health-care worker's accidental exposure, is obviously nonconsensual; there is 
now a possibly beneficial treatment, and it is doubtful that people would avoid 
medical care because of the very small risk of being tested involuntarily. So, 
the usual arguments against involuntary testing do not apply here. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, mandatory testing could be acceptable were there to be a 
significant benefit, especially if that benefit were prevention of HIV 
infection; if the information could not be obtained in other ways, and if 
proper safeguards protected the person being tested. 
</P>
<P>
Following a needle-stick injury, knowledge of whether a patient is infected, is 
beneficial to the health-care worker in two ways. The risk of infection 
following such exposure is about 1 in 250. While it is recognized that a 
negative test does not guarantee that the patient is uninfected, it clearly 
lowers the likelihood to less than 1%. Thus the risk of infection if the 
patient tests negative is less than 1 in 25,000. Current advice following a 
needle-stick is to recommend low-risk or no sexual behavior for 6 to 12 months 
while the worker has repeated tests to see if he or she had become infected. If 
the patient tested negative, the worry would be much less. Alternatively, if 
the patient tested positive, there would be greater worry and likely greater 
adherence to safer sex practices. 
</P>
<P>
Secondly, there is now information from animal studies suggesting that starting 
immediate treatment with AZT for six weeks might prevent infection with the 
AIDS virus or at least lessen the severity of disease after a needle-stick 
injury from an infected patient. A few health-care workers have entered a study 
using AZT or a placebo if they know the needle-stick came from an infected 
patient. Others are taking AZT without going into the study. Many AIDS 
physicians would recommend AZT after such an injury but probably not if the 
patient tested negative. While we do not know if AZT is effective or not, the 
worker needs information about whether the patient is infected to make the 
best-informed decision about what to do. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, why would such a law be necessary? The vast majority of patients, once 
informed about why the test was needed, would consent. The rare exception 
occurs, not because patients want to be stubborn or to harm a health-care 
worker. Rather it is because of fear that the test results, if positive, might 
get into the wrong hands, resulting in loss of job, insurance, home, friends. 
Sadly, confidentiality in hospitals, clinics, etc. needs a great deal of 
improvement. Perhaps even more important, some people are terrified of learning 
that they are infected. Many successful and unsuccessful suicide attempts, 
following a positive test, show this is a well-founded fear. 
</P>
<P>
If we understand both patients' and health-care workers' concerns, legislation 
with appropriate safeguards of confidentiality and of the patient's right not 
to know (if that is the patient's wish) can be developed and supported. Many 
practical issues about how to do this need to be worked out -- but it can and 
must be done for the legislation to be acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
In making the decision to support legislation with appropriate safeguards, one 
overriding concept must be kept in mind: We urge or require health-care workers 
to care for HIV-infected patients. When the workers' physical and mental 
well-being are at stake, it seems totally inappropriate not to provide them 
with all the information they need to care for themselves as well.

FOR A WIDER DEBATE ON WELFARE STATE; 
</P>
<P>
REAGAN COULD STIMULATE AN EXAMINATION OF THE POVERTY TRAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD SCHNEIDERMAN, Leonard Schneiderman is the dean of the School of 
Social Welfare at UCLA. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The best of Ronald Reagan may be yet to come. He wants to break new ground in 
defining the role of a former President. In that new role he may be able to 
make a contribution as great as any he has made as President. 
</P>
<P>
With a new career on the "mashed potato circuit" Reagan wants to "fight for the 
principles in which I believe." He hopes to stimulate a "great debate" focused 
on the need to "help America find a way out of the trap of the welfare state." 
"Twenty years ago" says the former President, "the government declared war on 
poverty and poverty won." "Too many people became dependent on government 
payments and lost the moral strength that has always given the poor the 
determination to climb America's ladder of opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
With 32.5 million Americans in poverty, with more than 20% of our children 
living in poverty, the former President is certainly right to call our 
attention to "poverty and the welfare state." Let's consider some of the 
questions that a debate should include. 
</P>
<P>
 -- With sustained economic growth over the last six years, why is the poverty 
rate now higher than in any year in the 1970s. The average poverty rate during 
the Nixon, Ford and Carter Administrations was 11.9%. Why has the poverty rate 
averaged 14.2% over the last eight years? Why has the increase in poverty 
rates, for all families including black families, occurred among both 
married-couple families and female-headed families? Why has the poverty rate 
for the black elderly risen from 31% to 33.9% and for the Latino elderly from 
22.5% to 27.4% over this last year when the poverty rate for white elderly has 
declined? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Are the welfare programs that are intended to aid the poor a major cause of 
the poverty they are intended to relieve? More than 20% of all American 
children live in poverty. The welfare program intended to assist poor children 
and their families is called Aid To Families With Dependent Children (AFDC). 
Given the low cash benefits provided, that program removes only 3% of poor 
children from poverty. It is difficult to imagine a less successful 
anti-poverty program. Yet, indignation about the growing impoverishment of the 
nation's children is hardly detectable in the criticism one hears about 
welfare. Are we more offended by the "dependency" of families who rely on 
government than we are by their "poverty"? In 1986, 52 of every 100 poor 
children received an AFDC benefit. In 1979, 72 of every 100 poor children 
received such aid. Those offended by "dependency" will find "progress" in these 
numbers. Those offended by unrelieved poverty will see these same numbers as a 
serious deterioration in social responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
We need a great debate to consider which is the greater evil, the unrelieved 
poverty of our children or their reliance upon government for assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 -- There is a growing consensus among liberals and conservatives that the 
current welfare system is inadequate. That consensus was apparent in the recent 
enactment of welfare-reform legislation by Congress with the support of the 
President. The new law speaks of getting people to work, of promoting 
self-reliance and independence through education, training, child care. Are we 
really prepared to go beyond criticism to genuine welfare reform? Or, are we 
satisfied to criticize what exists so we can cut budgets while avoiding real 
change because it costs too much, thus leaving the poor with criticism and 
little else? If we examine what Congress and what the state of California have 
done recently in the name of welfare reform the answer becomes evident. In both 
cases, much is promised but very little is given. Education, training, child 
care, transitional medical care, real work and independence from the dole 
provide the imagery. With $3.35 billion federal dollars provided over a 
five-year period we have $700 million per year to change welfare from a program 
of hand-outs to a program that will promote independence and get people to 
work. Who is kidding whom? 
</P>
<P>
To imagine what $700 million per year will buy for the nation's welfare 
recipients, it is useful to consider that in the implementation of California's 
welfare-reform legislation Los Angeles County estimated the annual cost of 
providing work-related education, training and social services to its AFDC 
population at $200 million per year. Los Angeles has 3%-4% of nation's 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Much has been made of the need to require people to leave welfare and to go 
to work. The popular imagery is of a welfare system that "sucks people in, saps 
their moral strength, and leaves them dependent and unmotivated." It is hard to 
find that attitude when you talk to real people. In 1,046 random personal 
interviews conducted by UCLA with AFDC recipients in Los Angeles County 85% 
wanted to volunteer to participate in a program that would help them prepare 
for and find work. With attacks from the political right on their dependency 
and moral degeneracy and promises from the political left unsupported by 
resources it is easy to wonder who is using welfare to cheat on whom. 
</P>
<P>
We need a great debate on poverty and the welfare state. We need to understand 
the cost to the nation of having 32.5 million of our citizens and 20% of our 
children living in poverty. The cost of doing nothing is much more than zero 
and when considered in the long run may exceed the cost of genuine reform. 
Still it is difficult to focus our attention on what seems so complex and so 
remote from our daily lives. 
</P>
<P>
We need a charismatic leader, a great communicator, someone unfettered by 
political ambition who can command public attention to what is surely one of 
the most important and most actively avoided subjects in our public life. 
</P>
<P>
We need a former president.

'DRUG-DEAL VICTIM' KIDNAPS WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 23-year-old East San Diego woman was kidnaped Wednesday afternoon near San 
Diego State University and, with a gun pointed at her head, was ordered to 
drive for almost an hour by a man who claimed to have been victimized by "a 
drug deal gone bad" and needed to find his car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman told San Diego police she was walking from campus to her car in the 
5500 block of Hardy Avenue when a man walked up, wielding a semiautomatic 
handgun. 
</P>
<P>
The man said, "Get in the car or I'll kill you," the woman told police. 
</P>
<P>
She said she followed the man's "continuous and disorganized directions" until 
he ordered her to pull over at Jamacha Road and Gustavo Street in El Cajon. 
After a brief struggle, police said, the man headed north on Jamacha on foot. 
</P>
<P>
He was wearing a blue baseball cap, blue jacket, brown pants and red tennis 
shoes, police said.

GLOVES COME OFF IN BURBANK;

<P>
HASTINGS ATTACKS HOWARD'S ROLE IN COUNCIL RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Burbank Councilman Michael R. Hastings blasted Councilwoman Mary Lou Howard on 
Wednesday, saying she used "lies and distortions" against him and a council 
member defeated in Tuesday's primary election. 
</P>
<P>
Hastings, 35, who finished second among 14 candidates vying for three council 
seats, said Howard used her influence with voters and unions representing city 
employees in her quest to form a council coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Howard called Hastings "a crybaby -- someone who acts like a little child when 
he doesn't get his own way." 
</P>
<P>
Howard and three of four employee unions did not endorse Hastings or 
Councilwoman Mary E. Kelsey, who lost her seat on the five-member body. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Flavin, vice chairman of the city Planning Board and one of three 
candidates supported by Howard, received more than 50% of the vote Tuesday to 
win election outright. 
</P>
<P>
Two other candidates backed by Howard, attorney Timothy Murphy and Mayor Al F. 
Dossin, finished third and fourth, respectively. They will compete against 
Hastings and political novice George Bonney for the remaining two seats in an 
April 11 runoff. 
</P>
<P>
"Mary Lou Howard wants more than just 20% control of the council," Hastings 
said. "She wants total control. And now too many people have been hurt. She 
should be ashamed to have any part in Mary Kelsey going out the way she is 
going out." 
</P>
<P>
Hastings cited mailers distributed by Howard and two unions over the weekend as 
particularly harmful to Kelsey. He said the mailers distorted his and Kelsey's 
stands. 
</P>
<P>
Howard -- who was not up for reelection since she is in the middle of her 
four-year term -- said, "Mary has only herself to blame for losing. How can she 
sit there week after week and turn her back on residents? How can she possibly 
have expected to be reelected?" 
</P>
<P>
Kelsey, 72, who was running for a second term, did not return several phone 
calls. She had been criticized by Howard and the unions, including the Burbank 
Fire Fighters Assn., Local 778, which said she had not lived up to her promise 
to slow development in the community. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody makes endorsements," Howard said. "I'm not trying to control 
anything or exploit people's trust in me. People don't have to follow me." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Gillenson, president of the 140-member International Brotherhood of 
Electrical Workers, Local 15, denied that his organization's endorsements were 
influenced by Howard. 
</P>
<P>
"Mary Lou Howard is uncannily accurate in knowing what's good for this city," 
he said. "We also hope we have a handle on what the city wants. So frequently 
we agree." 
</P>
<P>
Flavin, 42, said he recognizes the value of Howard's endorsement. But, he 
added, "I ran as an independent, and that's the way I see myself on the 
council." 
</P>
<P>
Flavin, an investment company executive, said his first priority will be to try 
to unify the council. "I think we need to get focused as a group to 
constructively address problems." 
</P>
<P>
He said the council must stop rampant growth. Along those lines, he said he 
will seek to determine whether a proposed $160-million shopping mall would be 
good for the community. 
</P>
<P>
Like the other candidates endorsed by Howard, Flavin favored a planned growth 
ordinance initiated by the councilwoman that won overwhelming voter approval 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, Measure 1 on the ballot, is designed to slow new apartment and 
residential development. It received more than 74% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Into Effect Immediately 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, which goes into effect immediately, prohibits property owners 
from building more units on their land than allowed by city code. The law also 
prevents the City Council from making changes in the city's master plan that 
would increase the number of residential units. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, 35, a Los Angeles County public defender, said he plans to keep 
stressing slow growth during the runoff campaign. He said Howard had 
significant influence in the election and on his success at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
About Kelsey's defeat, he said live cable broadcasts of the council's weekly 
meetings tarnished her image more than Howard's criticism did. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the first election affected by TV," Murphy said. "People have gotten 
a chance to see the council function in their living rooms. I think Michael 
Hastings' image on television is very good, and he comes across really well. 
But I think Mary Kelsey and Al Dossin have terrible images and don't come 
across well on TV." 
</P>
<P>
Kelsey was knocked out of the runoff by Bonney, a Los Angeles County Fire 
Department captain who ran without endorsements from any of the city's unions 
or homeowner groups. Howard said Bonney, 55, had enough backing to be the 
council race's "dark horse." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised," said Bonney, who added that he accepted only a few small 
contributions during his campaign. "I don't know why this happened. I've 
attended quite a few council meetings, and I guess people like the way I speak 
on TV." 
</P>
<P>
In other races, Burbank Board of Education President Audrey Hanson and Vice 
President Vivian Kaufman defeated two challengers, Denise Wilcox and S. Michael 
Stavropoulos. 
</P>
<P>
City Treasurer Jack Whitney, running for his fifth term, was cast into the 
April runoff with Jim Rogers, a retired bank executive. City Clerk Merle 
Woodburn, who ran unopposed, won a second four-year term.

PADRES MIGHT RENEW YOUNG TRIO'S CONTRACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
YUMA, Ariz. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If three of the Padres' top young players can't reach agreement with management 
by tonight, the club will renew their contracts at the club's figure, according 
to the players' agent, Scott Boras. 
</P>
<P>
In a sudden twist to previously peaceful negotiations, Benito Santiago, Roberto 
Alomar and Sandy Alomar Jr. -- the only three unsigned Padres -- all face the 
prospects of playing this season at salaries upon which they didn't agree. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Players Assn. collective bargaining agreement, a club may 
arbitrarily decide a contract figure until a player has three full years of 
big-league service, at which point a player can take a club to arbitration. The 
league deadline for renewal is March 10, but most clubs renew earlier to get 
everyone under contract before the beginning of exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me, we have until Thursday night," Boras said Wednesday from his 
office in Pomona. "I'm flying to Yuma and laying everything out on the table 
and hoping we can get something worked out." 
</P>
<P>
Dick Freeman, Padre interim president, said, "I cannot discuss this until I 
talk it over with everybody and see where we stand. Just say we are close with 
some, and not too close with a couple of others." 
</P>
<P>
Santiago, who made $165,000 last year in his second season, is hoping for a 
package that would put him close to $375,000, while the club is offering closer 
to $280,000. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Alomar, who made $62,500 as a rookie, is hoping for about $175,000. The 
team is offering approximately $145,000. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Alomar Jr. was on a minor league contract last season, and is close to 
agreement, partially because with no big-league service, he can't hope for 
anything more than the major league minimum of $67,500. 
</P>
<P>
"The way it works, they can just renew them, but we hope to get something done 
in time," Boras said "We understand the collective bargaining agreement, and we 
abide by it, but we'd like to get everything out and see what can be done." 
</P>
<P>
Automatic renewal, which effects players differently depending on their 
sensitivity, is not uncommon with the Padres. Last spring, pitchers Dave Leiper 
and Mark Grant had contracts renewed. In the past, even former star outfielder 
Kevin McReynolds was renewed. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have to renew, it will be for a fair price," Freeman said. "We aren't 
going to penalize anybody (as some clubs do) or try to hurt anybody. We will 
just pay them what we think it appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Keeping everyone happy will be a little trickier this year with the 
impressionable Santiago, who had contract trouble last season after he was 
Rookie of the Year in 1987. Before settling on his $165,000 contract, he walked 
off the field for a couple of hours, and later said the distractions caused ill 
will that lasted throughout the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Last winter he promptly dropped his agents -- Davimos Sports of Miami -- and 
picked up Boras, who immediately made one demand. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Benito, you just worry about having the best year you can," Boras said. 
"We understand how the process works, and we know what can happen if he has the 
kind of year for which he is capable." 
</P>
<P>
Translated, Santiago should keep quiet, because he can nail the Padres next 
year in arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
He is having trouble in these negotiations because of numbers other than the 
ones on the contract. Last year, while he won a a Gold Glove and a second 
straight Silver Slugger award (best hitting catcher) and grew to be considered 
perhaps the best overall catcher in baseball, his batting fell off from 1987. 
His average went from .300 to .248, his home runs fell from 18 to 10, and his 
RBIs from 79 to 46. 
</P>
<P>
Yet he is seeking more than the $100,000 raise given him for being Rookie of 
the Year. While any player or fan can tell you he was a better player, a more 
intimidating force, clubs don't pay on perception, but stats. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying nothing, I'm only thinking happy, thinking about great year," 
Santiago said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Alomar was a little more blunt: "It's OK, I not say nothing, they get 
me this year and next year," he said. "But then comes arbitration, and I get 
them." 
</P>
<P>
He is being hurt because, while his overall statistics were better than 
virtually all of last year's top rookies, he didn't even finish in the top 
three in the Rookie of the Year balloting. Because the Padres paid Santiago 
last year based on that award, they will want to keep the same standards. 
</P>
<P>
Boras said he would not advise his players against renewal, in part because low 
renewals help a player in arbitration, but mostly because he doesn't want them 
to sign a contract they don't like. 
</P>
<P>
"The players know that renewal is an option, and if they feel we can't come to 
agreement, then it is their best interest not to sign," Boras said. "It's all 
up to how they feel." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Hurst woke up Wednesday feeling fine after his 15 minutes worth of 
throwing Tuesday. He was met in the training room by pitching coach Pat Dobson, 
and pronounced fit to start the club's spring opener Friday here against the 
Angels. "Dr. Dobber said I was fine," Hurst said. "Yeah, I feel great, no 
stiffness, I'm ready." . . . John Kruk, recovering from winter knee surgery, 
saw limited action in a simulated game Wednesday and appeared to be improving, 
although he is still not near 100%. "We're going to take it slow with him," 
Manager Jack McKeon said. "We play him a couple of days here, a couple of days 
there, let him be the DH a couple of times. We aren't worried about him being 
ready for March 5, we're worried about the regular season." . . . The pitching 
star of Wednesday's simulated game was left-hander Pat Clements, acquired this 
winter with Jack Clark from the New York Yankees. He had not been impressive so 
far this spring because of bad mechanics, but Dobson said that Wednesday he 
suddenly seemed to figure everything out. "He's made a lot of progress in a 
week, I was very, very pleased with him," Dobson said. "He had a lot of trouble 
at first, but he's working hard and getting it solved." Admitted Clements, who 
may be working his way back into contention for the final bullpen spot: "I was 
pretty messed up when I came here, but Dobson is known for being good with 
mechanics, and everything he's done has worked." . . . Pitcher Walt Terrell 
also was happy with his outing Wednesday, his first in a game situation as a 
Padre, but for a different reason. "It was good for a first day -- most of my 
pitches got there in the air," Terrell said.

MAGIC SCORES 35 POINTS AS LAKERS AVENGE LOSS TO WARRIORS, 142-121 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Every time Magic Johnson made a solo foray through the lane Wednesday night 
against the Golden State Warriors at the Forum, it brought back painful 
memories among Laker watchers, if not Johnson himself. 
</P>
<P>
It was exactly three weeks ago Wednesday -- same opponent, same site -- that 
Johnson partially tore his left hamstring after making one of those twisting 
layups, resulting in two weeks of forced inactivity. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night's sequel between the Lakers and Warriors, however, bore little 
resemblance to that Feb. 8 night of upset and injury. This time, Johnson scored 
35 points from inside, outside and everywhere in between as the Lakers avenged 
a rare home-court loss by pounding the Warriors, 142-121, before 17,505. 
</P>
<P>
If any doubt lingered as to whether Johnson had fully recovered from his 
injury, it was definitively answered with one of his most dominant performances 
of the season and certainly his best since returning three games ago. 
</P>
<P>
All Johnson did in three quarters of action was make 13 of 20 shots, including 
four three-pointers, grab a season-high 14 rebounds and pass for 8 assists. Had 
the Lakers needed Johnson at all in the fourth quarter of this blowout, he 
probably would have registered his first post-injury triple-double. 
</P>
<P>
That was of little concern to the Lakers, who extended their Pacific Division 
lead to 3 1/2 games over idle Phoenix. More important, perhaps, was that 
Johnson touched down from each drive without a grimace or a limp and usually 
with another Laker basket. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't remind me of that (Feb. 8) game," Johnson said, wincing slightly. "I 
couldn't think about that. I was just going right at them. I never get scared 
or worried about getting hurt. You just got to continue to drive and see what 
happens." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson wasn't the only offensive weapon for the Lakers, only the most potent 
one. 
</P>
<P>
Byron Scott benefited from the Lakers' running game by scoring 11 of his 25 
points in a 46-point third quarter. A.C. Green had 18 points and 12 rebounds, 
James Worthy 15 points and nine rebounds and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 12 points and 
eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Johnson, supported by excellent team defense and a 66-40 rebounding 
edge, who was responsible for the blowout. 
</P>
<P>
When he wasn't driving through the crowded lane for twisting layups or drawing 
fouls and a pounding, he was swishing long-distance shots that eventually 
opened gaps in the lane through which he could have driven a Buick. 
</P>
<P>
"He was strong tonight," Laker Coach Pat Riley said. "Real strong. When he 
drives to the basket now, he drives with force. He doesn't let the opponent 
strong-arm him. It opened things up. I mean, at 6-foot-9, 220, he can do that. 
I think that's something he's learned the last three years." 
</P>
<P>
Another thing Johnson has learned, painfully so, is how to swiftly recuperate 
from injuries. He said he did not rush back, made sure he was fit and now 
totally forgets about his hamstring when he steps onto the court. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm all the way back now, except maybe for my conditioning," Johnson 
said. "Last game, I was better. This game, better. Not only my game, but my 
condition. I don't think I'm far away at all. Another one or two games, and 
I'll be (the way he was). 
</P>
<P>
"You feel good being able to do things like before tonight, the twisting layups 
and things. You have to do that." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, obviously, are happy to have him back. They survived during his 
absence, winning three of five games. But since Johnson's return, the Lakers 
(38-17) have recorded three straight blowout victories against Pacific Division 
teams at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Just as they did to the Suns three nights earlier, the Lakers came out strong 
and dominated the Warriors from the start. 
</P>
<P>
They led by seven points after the first quarter and stretched the advantage to 
17 by halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Then came perhaps the Lakers' best third quarter of the season, the 46-point 
quarter that gave them a 33-point lead heading into the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
In the third, the Lakers held a 25-5 rebounding advantage, forced Golden State 
to make just 40% of its shots, held Chris Mullin (25 points) to only two free 
throws and converted seven fast-break opportunities for baskets. Then, there 
was Johnson, who sank three three-point shots and drove the lane with abandon. 
</P>
<P>
So dominant were the Lakers that they rendered the inevitable matchup problems 
moot. Golden State starts four guards and 6-8 Larry Smith at center, but then 
can bring in 7-7 Manute Bol and change a game's flow entirely. 
</P>
<P>
But, unlike the three-point loss on Feb. 8, the Lakers handled every 
combination the Warriors threw at them. 
</P>
<P>
"We were concerned with the matchups," Riley said. "You have to get them before 
they get to you. The key was rebounding. In that third quarter, we had 
something like a 24-6 advantage. If you let a team of 6-5 guys outrebound you 
and run, you'll get blown out." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Warriors (31-22) were on the receiving end. 
</P>
<P>
"We just got blown out," Coach Don Nelson said. "It happens several times a 
year, but it hadn't happened to us in a while. This was total domination. 
</P>
<P>
"They did everything they wanted to do. They beat us in the rebounding game, 
the shooting game, the defensive game. They just blew us out, cut and dried, 
from the first quarter." 
</P>
<P>
Now, instead of Johnson, it is Golden State that carries the painful memories. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar declined to comment Wednesday night on his conviction for 
misdemeanor assault stemming from a shoving incident involving a tourist in a 
Phoenix shopping mall last year. Gary Bettman, the NBA's vice president and 
general counsel, said that there is a good-conduct provision in all player 
contracts, and that a player who violates it can be suspended. 
</P>
<P>
"But let me say that there's a big difference between, say, shooting somebody 
and shoving a camera in his face," Bettman said. "Based on what we know about 
the case, it's not exactly a heinous offense. I haven't read the judge's 
ruling, so we aren't going to do anything -- if we do anything -- until we get 
a full determination from the court." 
</P>
<P>
Only in California Department: At the request of Golden State Warrior owner Jim 
Fitzgerald, who lives in Palm Springs, Warrior reserve center Ralph Sampson 
spent part of Tuesday receiving treatment from two "anatomical functionalists," 
an elaborate name for physical therapists. The specialists analyzed Sampson's 
body motion and discovered a problem with some muscles around his hips and 
spine. So, they realigned his hips and spine in hopes of improving his movement 
on the court. This, apparently, has nothing to do with Sampson's knee surgery. 
. . . The Lakers are off today and play host to the Indiana Pacers on Friday 
night. Then, they embark on a five-game trip.

FLAMES, CAPITALS EXPECT MONEY'S WORTH

Although President John Ziegler of the National Hockey League estimates that 
playing in a series next September in Leningrad and Moscow will cost the 
Washington Capitals and the Calgary Flames a little more than $1 million 
apiece, the teams seem ecstatic about being chosen. 
</P>
<P>
Capital General Manager David Poile said at the news conference to announce the 
series: "This is a wonderful opportunity. I think it would have been foolish if 
we hadn't taken advantage of this. There are certainly going to be many 
exciting experiences, both on and off the ice, that will make this a trip to 
remember and savor. This experience will be a shot in the arm to our entire 
organization. It's something we are eagerly looking forward to." 
</P>
<P>
The teams also will train in Finland and Sweden before going to the Soviet 
Union for four games each against Soviet First Division teams. 
</P>
<P>
Dave (Tiger) Williams, the all-time leader in penalty minutes -- 3,966 -- after 
a 13-year career with Toronto, Vancouver, Detroit, the Kings and Hartford, is 
having no second thoughts about how he played the game now that he has retired. 
As the debate rages on about whether the NHL needs fighting, the Detroit News 
asked Williams his opinion. 
</P>
<P>
He had one, too: "Not once, never, did I have an owner come up to me 
disgruntled with the way I played. . . . I never look back, never say I wish I 
had never played like that. I was a 50-goal scorer in junior. I was cracky 
enough to take the challenge, year-in, year-out. Maybe I should have sat back 
and let somebody else do it. In Toronto in 1974, we had nobody else to do it. A 
lot of nights it was tough slugging." 
</P>
<P>
And furthermore, Williams said: "Bossy gets up at a banquet, he thinks he 
scored 50 goals because of Mike Bossy. Never gave any credit to (Clark) 
Gillies, who was 6-4, 225. . . . No credit to Billy Smith, who wielded his 
goalie stick like an ax. If Bossy thought fighting was so bad, why not say so 
when he was still playing? 
</P>
<P>
"Fact remains, there are a lot of players, if they knew they had somebody 
behind them, they'd be better. But few guys come up to you after a game to say, 
'Thank you, you bailed me out.' How does a guy come up to you and say, 'Thanks. 
I'm chicken. Thanks for saving my butt.' " 
</P>
<P>
According to Bob Johnson, former University of Wisconsin coach, former Calgary 
Flames coach and now executive director of the American Hockey Assn. of the 
United States, his amateur league went from 12,000 to 14,000 teams this year 
and is expected to go to 15,000 teams next year. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said: "They're worried about hockey in Russia. They have only 180 
indoor rinks and they don't get kids. Registration in Canada is down. Ours is 
up. Hockey is making an upswing. I'd say hockey today is better in the U.S. 
than ever before. Even in Phoenix, it's up. Why? Because they get Prime Ticket 
from Los Angeles and watch Wayne Gretzky." 
</P>
<P>
Thanks, Dad. Bobby Hull went to Maple Leaf Garden Monday to see his son, Brett, 
who scored a goal and three assists for the St. Louis Blues in a 7-5 victory 
over Toronto. But when it was over, Bobby could only marvel at how bad both 
teams were. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever made the last mistake won the game," he said, apparently making one 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
After recording a hat trick against the Kings Monday night, Guy Lafleur of the 
Rangers said of Gretzky: "I can't really compete with him. He's got about 900 
more points than me. I know I don't get the same ice time he does, but any time 
I'm out there, I want to prove to everybody I'm not over the hill." 
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old Hall of Famer added: "My main goal is to finish the season so I 
can sign another contract for next year." 
</P>
<P>
A week earlier, Lafleur was quoted in Newsday as saying: "I think I'm living 
everybody's dream. Every ex-hockey player, every old-timer -- if they could, 
they wish they had this opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Duguay of the Kings made news and notes all around the National Hockey 
League when, after suffering a concussion in a game last month, he returned to 
the ice wearing a helmet for the first time. But by the time the nation's 
hockey writers had noted that his decision to wear a helmet left just six 
active players without helmets -- Washington's Rod Langway, Chicago's Doug 
Wilson, Toronto's Al Secord and Brad Marsh, Winnipeg's Randy Carlyle and 
Lafleur -- Duguay had taken his hat off again. 
</P>
<P>
He has explained that he wanted the protection until he was sure he was 
recovered from the concussion. 
</P>
<P>
On playing in Los Angeles: "The players don't even know who they're playing 
against sometimes, but they always know they're going to L.A.," Quebec Coach 
Jean Perron said. "They have the white suit and pink tie packed." 
</P>
<P>
King owner Bruce McNall, in explaining that "there's no such thing as too much 
of a good thing" after acquiring goalie Kelly Hrudey from the Islanders, said: 
"We have Wayne Gretzky, but if somebody asked me if we wanted Steve Yzerman, 
too, I'd say, 'What would it take?' " 
</P>
<P>
Hockey Notes 
</P>
<P>
As Stanley Cup time draws closer, the Montreal Canadiens get tougher. The 
Canadiens had a record of 10-1-1 in their last 12 games before Wednesday 
night's game at Edmonton. Goalie Patrick Roy is 20-0-2 at home. . . . Mike 
Vernon of the Calgary Flames is 14-0-1 in his last 15 games. . . . Mario 
Lemieux's three assists, to go with goal No. 65, in a game Sunday night made 
him the third player in NHL history to have 100 or more assists in a season. 
The two others are Wayne Gretzky and Bobby Orr. . . . The Chicago Blackhawks 
got a scare last week when goalie Alain Chevrier, acquired from Winnipeg last 
month, went down with a knee injury. But the knee is just sprained and he is 
expected back in two weeks. . . . Tim Kerr, finally back with the Philadelphia 
Flyers after having five operations to correct damage in his left shoulder, had 
a hat trick and two assists in the Flyers' 6-4 victory over the Rangers last 
Wednesday.

MORNING BRIEFING: THEY'RE PUSHING TOO FAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Butch van Breda Kolff, who has coached Picayune High School in New Orleans and 
the Lakers, with a women's pro basketball team in between, is in the second 
year of his second stint as coach at Hofstra University. He is more 
disillusioned than ever. 
</P>
<P>
"The NCAA has made it so the game is played for the spectator," he told 
Newsday. "The NCAA wants to put on a show, TV, hoopla, hype. It's ceased being 
a sport. It's a sham. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's be honest. They don't want to blow the whistle. The game's too physical. 
Bully-ball is what it's become. The fundamentals of the game are being 
completely forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
"All the kids want to be Dr. J, but nobody can throw a two-hand pass anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Add van Breda Kolff: He last coached Hofstra in 1962, before moving on to the 
National Basketball Assn. Since then, he admits, there have been changes. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest change I've had to go through is the change in bureaucracy," he 
said. "When I started at Lafayette, I had no assistants. I did everything 
myself, plus I coached soccer and lacrosse. I was a good soccer coach. But 
lacrosse? Terrible. The first game I coached was the first I ever saw. We went 
0-9 that year and I said, 'Well, we can't do any worse next year,' and then the 
A.D. went out and scheduled 10 games." 
</P>
<P>
Department of what goes around, etc: According to Duane Thomas' biography, 
"Duane Thomas and the Fall of America's Team," Tony Dorsett was once heard 
remonstrating about his unceremonious demotion in favor of Herschel Walker. 
</P>
<P>
This was well in advance of Coach Tom Landry's own demotion, which was at least 
as unceremonious. 
</P>
<P>
"A guy shouldn't have to read it in the papers," Dorsett complained. "(Tom) 
Landry or the general manager owes it to us. We should hear it first from 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Hall of Famer Whitey Ford got to calculating when Roger Clemens' contract with 
Boston was announced. 
</P>
<P>
"As I figure it, and I think I'm right, the Red Sox are paying Roger Clemens 
$600 a pitch," he said. 
</P>
<P>
This, the former New York Yankees star said, contrasts with his $16.60-a-pitch 
season, when he earned $78,000. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing to calculate, Ford worked out figures that showed Kirby Puckett will 
earn $4,000 an at-bat this season. Fellow Hall of Famer Mickey Mantle, 
meanwhile, made $200 per at-bat in his highest-salaried year. 
</P>
<P>
Not ready for prime time: Others may have noticed it, but it took Phil Jackman 
of the Baltimore Evening Sun to point it out. 
</P>
<P>
"On the same day the NBA announced that 14 games will be broadcast in the 
Soviet Union beginning next month, a station in Los Angeles said it was cutting 
back on Clipper games," Jackman wrote. 
</P>
<P>
There's a lesson there somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Attention, Whitey Ford: It might be comforting to all the old-timers to know 
that Joe DiMaggio, though he never made more than $100,000 as the Yankee 
Clipper, is now pulling down $5,000 an hour at baseball card shows. 
</P>
<P>
What goes around, continued: UCLA Coach Jim Harrick, whose team scored its 
biggest victory this season after a controversial goaltending call against 
Louisville, was nevertheless complaining about the officiating recently. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven 't seen them give us any breaks this year," he said, then paused. 
"Well, except for one." 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook 
</P>
<P>
Fighting Irish football Coach Lou Holtz, after the shortest Morning Briefing 
off-season ever, had this to say about Miami Coach Jimmy Johnson's moving on to 
the Dallas Cowboys. "Better that than at Notre Dame."

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK / RICK HAZELTINE: ABBOTT MOVES UP AND KEEPS WINNING 
</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kyle Abbott was a successful pitcher at UC San Diego for two years. But whether 
he could carry that success from the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
Division III Tritons to a Division I program was another question. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott seems to have answered the question with ease after transferring from 
UCSD to Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott played his freshman and sophomore seasons at UCSD, helping the Tritons 
to the Division III World Series his freshman year. But after two years, Abbott 
decided to see if he could carry that success to the Division I level. 
</P>
<P>
So far he hasn't had too much trouble. Abbott, a 6-foot-5 left-hander, is 5-0 
with a 1.70 earned-run average. Abbott has victories over Pepperdine (4-3), 
Arizona (8-6), Loyola Marymount (9-0), USD (11-5), and St. Mary's (15-0). 
</P>
<P>
"I watched a lot of Division I players on ESPN over the summer," Abbott said. 
"I always thought I could do it, but I didn't know how well I'd do." 
</P>
<P>
Abbott, from Mission Viejo, was 3-1 with two saves and a 1.70 ERA his freshman 
year as the Tritons advanced to the World Series for the first time. His 
sophomore year, Abbott was 5-1 with three saves and a 1.88 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
He had to sit out a month during his sophomore season because he had 
insufficient academic units and he admitted he was struggling with his classes, 
carrying a 2.5 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
Those factors and his performance last summer combined to help him decide to 
try the Division I level. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a great summer league and that's what convinced me," said Abbott, who 
played in a summer league in Los Angeles with a number of Division I players. 
</P>
<P>
But facing Division III hitters most of the season is different than going 
against Division I athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't worried about it," Abbott said. "The only thing keeping me from 
leaving was my friends. But I thought the opportunity to play was worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Baseball is nothing new to Abbott. His father, Larry, was a pitcher in the 
Oakland Athletics' organization for seven years, reaching the triple-A level. 
Abbott also thought he would have a better chance at being drafted higher with 
good numbers from a Division I school as opposed to a Division III program. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. International University's Demetrius Laffitte finished his basketball 
season a little early, suffering a slight ligament tear in his right knee 
Saturday against San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
Laffitte, who played at Monte Vista High School, played at Cal State Long Beach 
and Grossmont College before transferring to USIU. 
</P>
<P>
He had a fine junior year this season, leading the team in scoring and 
rebounding. Laffitte, a 6-5 forward, averaged 18.5 points and 10.4 rebounds per 
game. He also shot 55.4% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
He averaged 10.4 rebounds during the season, the second-best total in school 
history. (Don Robinson averaged 11.8 in 1981-82.) His season shooting 
percentage of 55.4 was also second to Steve Frederick's school-record 57.9 in 
1983-84. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Steve Smith set the single-season assist record with his first assist 
against San Diego State last week, finishing the season with 127. The record 
was 121 set by Joe Yezbak in 1986-87. 
</P>
<P>
The University of San Diego men's tennis team is ranked No. 21 nationally. 
Freshman Jose Luis Noriega is ranked No. 78, senior Mark Farren is No. 81 and 
junior Dan Mattera is No. 86 in the individual rankings. Noriega and senior 
David Stewart are the No. 32-ranked doubles team. 
</P>
<P>
The UC San Diego women's basketball team finished a record-setting year. The 
Tritons were 19-6, breaking the school record for victories set when the 
1982-83 finished 17-9.

SANTA CLARA GETS PAST SANTA YNEZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Guard Tammy Atkins scored 14 points in the fourth quarter Wednesday night as 
Santa Clara High School defeated Santa Ynez, 43-34, to win the Southern Section 
Girls' 2-A basketball championship at Lompoc High. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara took control of a close game in the fourth quarter behind Atkins. 
But Santa Ynez also was hurt when center Jennie Kramer, who had 15 rebounds, 
fouled out. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was Santa Clara's third this season over its Frontier League rival.

SAN BERNARDINO OUTLASTS GLENDORA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It took an undefeated team with a hot hand to end the heralded high school 
career of Glendora High School scoring sensation Tracy Murray Wednesday night 
in UC Irvine's Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino won its 30th consecutive game by making 28 of 45 shots and 
withstood Murray's 41-point performance to claim the Southern Section's 4-AA 
division title with a 72-69 victory over Glendora before 5,650. 
</P>
<P>
Murray, the country's leading prep scorer with a 45-point average, made 10 of 
27 shots but struggled to make only six of 15 from three-point range for 
Glendora (28-2). Murray scored 19 of his points in the last quarter, including 
three three-point shots in the final minutes to keep the score close. 
</P>
<P>
But San Bernardino (30-0) won its first sectional basketball title in the 
school's 105-year history, gaining a championship that it came so close to 
claiming twice in three previous seasons. San Bernardino reached the section 
semifinals in 1986 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel comfortable until there was six seconds on the clock," said 
Scott Kay, San Bernardino coach. "This is a great group of kids who are not 
afraid to work hard and play defense." 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino made Murray work for his shots, limiting the 6-foot-7 senior to 
only seven shots in the second and third quarters when it took control of the 
game. Forward Byron Russell scored 14 of his 26 points in the second quarter to 
give San Bernardino a 34-27 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Mike LeDuc, Glendora coach, credited an unaggressive first half for his team's 
downfall and said Glendora needed to play near perfect to beat the division's 
top-ranked team. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't give Tracy enough help," LeDuc said. "They're a tough defensive team 
with good athletes and it proved to be too much for Tracy. The first half 
really hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
Among the capacity crowd were coaches Rollie Massimino of Villanova and Jerry 
Tarkanian of Nevada Las Vegas. Murray finished his prep career as the state's 
career scoring leader (2,895 points) and single-season scoring leader (1,347 
points). 
</P>
<P>
In the 4-A final: 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez 78, Artesia 49 -- A smothering zone defense and 26 Artesia turnovers 
led to a surprisingly easy Dominguez victory. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez' 2-3 zone dropped as many as four players on Artesia's 6-8 center Ed 
O'Bannon, considered one of the country's top juniors. O'Bannon, who came into 
the game averaging 28 points a game, had just five in the first half and 
finished with 21. 
</P>
<P>
Dijon Bernard scored 13 points and Eric Edison added 12 to lead Dominguez to a 
38-22 halftime lead, outscoring Artesia, 8-0, in the last 1:20 with O'Bannon 
was on the bench with foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Edison led Dominguez with 22 points, Derrick Thomas had 18 and Bernard added 
17.

SCOTT, GEORGIA TECH STEAL WIN FROM NORTH CAROLINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The main thing Dennis Scott didn't want to do was rush his shot after coming up 
with a steal with five seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Scott stole an inbounds pass, calmly turned and, with two seconds left, hit his 
seventh three-point basket of the game to give Georgia Tech a 76-74 Atlantic 
Coast Conference victory over No. 5 North Carolina Wednesday night at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"It was absolutely, totally incredible," Georgia Tech Coach Bobby Cremins said 
after the Yellow Jackets snapped a string of seven straight losses to the Tar 
Heels. "It's just unbelievable. What a steal." 
</P>
<P>
Said Scott: "This might have been the biggest shot of my whole life. The DePaul 
shot (a game-winner last season) was big, but this was UNC, the conference and 
the seniors' last home game. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I had enough time left and I didn't want to rush it. It would have 
killed me if I had missed an easy shot for the seniors." 
</P>
<P>
Scott, who scored 28 points, made the steal in the left corner, turned and hit 
the game-winning shot that gave the Yellow Jackets only their sixth victory in 
38 meetings with the Tar Heels. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Dean Smith said he was disappointed his Tar Heels couldn't wrap up their 
11th regular-season ACC crown in 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech is 20-9 overall and 8-5 in the conference. North Carolina, which 
had a six-game winning streak snapped, is 24-6 and 9-4. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Hammonds, the third-leading scorer in Yellow Jacket history, had his jersey 
No. 20 retired before the game. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas State 76, Missouri 75 -- Tony Massop's tip-in at the buzzer gave Kansas 
State the Big Eight Conference win over seventh-ranked Missouri at Manhattan, 
Kan., which enabled Oklahoma to clinch the conference title. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri's Greg Church, in the best game of his career, made two free throws 
with 11 seconds remaining to give Missouri a 75-74 lead. Church, a 6-8 senior 
whose previous career high was 18 points, had 31. Steve Henson, who had 23 
points for Kansas State, missed a shot as the clock wound down, but Massop 
tipped in the miss. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas State is 18-8 and 8-5. Missouri, coming off a victory over Oklahoma that 
knocked the Sooners from the No. 1 national ranking, is 23-7 and 9-4. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers missed only two of 24 free throws but still fell to 3-4 under 
interim Coach Rich Daly. The Tigers have not won on the road since Daly 
replaced Norm Stewart, who underwent cancer surgery last month and was released 
from a hospital earlier Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma 111, Oklahoma State 108 -- Stacey King scored 27 points, including a 
basket with 12 seconds left, as the fourth-ranked Sooners wrapped up the Big 
Eight title with the win at Norman, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
By winning its 29th straight at home, Oklahoma improved to 25-4 overall and 
11-2 in conference. Oklahoma State, which knocked the Sooners from the No. 1 
spot in the national with a victory earlier this season, is 16-10 and 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma State pulled within a point on Darwyn Alexander's free throw with 52 
seconds left. But when he missed his second try, King rebounded and the Sooners 
worked the clock until Mookie Blaylock drove into the lane and dished off to 
King under the basket. 
</P>
<P>
Blaylock's final assist gave him 11 in the game, making him the first player in 
NCAA history to record 200 assists and 100 steals in consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
A three-point shot by Oklahoma State's Royce Jeffries' with four seconds left 
bounced off the rim. 
</P>
<P>
The 108 points is the most Oklahoma State has ever scored in a loss. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati 77, Louisville 71 -- Louis Banks scored 24 points and Cincinnati 
made 10 straight free throws in the final minute to cap the Metro Conference 
comeback victory over the 14th-ranked Cardinals at Louisville, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville (19-8, 8-4), led, 55-45, with 11 minutes left when Cincinnati took 
over. Two free throws by Levertis Robinson with 4:26 left capped an 18-7 spurt 
that gave the Bearcats the lead for good, 63-62. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati (15-11, 5-6) led, 67-65, when Louisville's LaBradford Smith missed a 
free throw three minutes later. The Bearcats then began their string of free 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson 79, Duke 74 -- Elden Campbell scored six straight points to key a late 
scoring surge that carried the Tigers to the ACC upset win at Clemson, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 69-69, the Tigers scored seven straight points and held 
the Blue Devils scoreless for 3 1/2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson nearly lost the game at the foul line, missing four free throws in the 
final 2:22. Duke cut the lead to 76-74 on a three-point shot by Greg Koubek 
with 53 seconds left, but Tim Kincaid hit one foul shot and Marion Cash made 
two more with 24 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson is 17-9 and 6-7. Duke, which hit a season-low 39.2% from the field, is 
21-6 and 8-5. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Devils played without junior center Alaa Abdelnaby, who was suspended 
before the game by Coach Mike Krzyzewski for academic reasons. The 6-10 
Abdelnaby is the team's fourth-leading scorer at 9.7 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana 73, Ohio State 66 -- Jay Edwards scored 27 of his 34 points in the 
first half at Columbus, Ohio, as the third-ranked Hoosiers clinched a tie for 
the Big Ten title. 
</P>
<P>
The victory moved Indiana to 24-5 and 14-1. Ohio State, which lost its fifth 
straight, fell to 17-11 and 6-9. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards hit 10 of 12 shots, including five of six three-pointers, in the first 
half as Indiana built a 39-30 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Hoosiers have won the last eight games between the schools and lead the 
series, 79-57. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State hit 24 of 61 shots for 39%, marking the third straight game it has 
failed to top 40% from the field. Indiana hit 26 of 59 shots from the field for 
44%. 
</P>
<P>
West Virginia 76, Penn State 61 -- Ray Foster scored 15 points and Herbie 
Brooks added 13 as the 15th-ranked Mountaineers rallied to win at State 
College, Pa., and clinch the Atlantic 10 Conference regular-season 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
West Virginia finished the regular season 24-3, its best record since a 24-2 
mark in 1981-82, and 17-1 in the conference for its first Atlantic 10 title 
since 1984-85. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State is 17-10, 12-6. 
</P>
<P>
Ball State 78, Miami (Ohio) 60 -- Keith Stalling came off the bench to score 12 
of his 14 points in the second half of the Mid-American Conference game at 
Muncie, Ind., and lead 19th-ranked Ball State to its 11th straight victory. 
</P>
<P>
Stalling had 10 points in two key second-half runs as Ball State improved 24-2, 
best among Division I teams, and 13-2 in the MAC. Miami dropped to 12-14 and 
7-8. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State 117, Virginia Tech 97 -- Tony Dawson and Tharon Mayes sparked an 
18-2 run to open the second half as the 16th-ranked Seminoles broke a four-game 
losing streak with the Metro Conference win at Tallahassee, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State (20-6, 8-3) can clinch at least a tie for the conference title 
with a victory Saturday at Southern Mississippi. Virginia Tech is 10-17 and 
1-10. 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall 80, Providence 68 -- John Morton hit three consecutive three-point 
baskets and scored 19 points to rally No. 12 Seton Hall to the Big East win at 
Providence, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates (24-5, 11-5) finished with their best conference record ever. 
Providence is 17-9 and 6-9.

KENDALL HOPES SWITCH WON'T CHANGE HIS LUCK 
</P>

<P>
The last time Tom Kendall made a switch, he had just won his second straight 
International Motor Sports Assn. GTU championship driving a Mazda. But the 
switch didn't hurt him. He moved into an untried Chevrolet Beretta -- and won a 
third championship. 
</P>
<P>
Now the 22-year-old UCLA senior from La Canada Flintridge is switching again, 
but not his make of car. He is leaving IMSA's GTU class -- for grand touring 
cars with engine displacement under two liters -- to drive a C&amp;C Beretta in 
the Sports Car Club of America's Trans-Am series. 
</P>
<P>
Making the move with Kendall, a member of the 1988 racing writers All-American 
team, will be his long-time teammate, Max Jones of Long Beach. Jones, the 1987 
SCCA race truck champion, finished third in GTU last season. 
</P>
<P>
The Trans-Am season will begin April 15 as part of the Long Beach Grand Prix 
weekend, featuring Indy cars on the following day. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, Kendall will take a trial run in the Beretta in an IMSA GTO race 
at the Grand Prix of Miami, a street race along the shores of Biscayne Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be pretty much last year's car with a new (and larger) engine plugged 
in," Kendall said before leaving for Florida. "It's mainly to give us an idea 
what to expect from the larger engine." 
</P>
<P>
The Beretta, which was powered by a three-liter Chevrolet V-6 last year when 
Kendall and Jones won seven of 11 races and the GTU manufacturer's 
championship, will have a 4.5-liter V-6 engine for the Miami race and the 
Trans-Am. Last year's win was the first for a domestic car maker in IMSA's 
18-year history. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be the underdogs in Trans-Am, but we were the underdogs at the start of 
last year, too," Kendall said. "We really thought it would take a couple of 
years before we could win in GTU, but when we accomplished our goal the first 
year, C&amp;C decided to take another step up." 
</P>
<P>
Audi Quatrro won the Trans-Am manufacturer's championship last year, with 
Hurley Haywood, an Audi dealer from Ponte Vedra, Fla., winning the individual 
crown. The veteran Haywood, who has won four 24-hour races at Daytona and two 
at Le Mans, won only two of the 100-mile sprints but he finished in the top 
four in nine of 13 races. So far this year, however, Audi has not announced 
plans to defend its championship. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, personally, Trans-Am is another step toward my ultimate goal, getting 
into an Indy car program," Kendall said. "Five of the Trans-Am races will be 
run with CART Indy cars, so I'll get plenty of exposure, and with the way 
Chevrolet motors performed last year, I can't help but feel good." 
</P>
<P>
Chevrolet-powered cars won 14 of 15 Indy car races last season. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that if an engine does well in one 
series, it should do well in the next one," Kendall said. "This year will be 
important for me because I will get some higher horsepower experience. The 
other thing I need is some oval track experience. I need to get a feel for it 
if I want to get an Indy car ride." 
</P>
<P>
Kendall has driven in only two oval races, both in Formula Russell in 1985, 
when he was only 18. 
</P>
<P>
Although Kendall will drive the '88 model Beretta in the Miami race, he and 
Jones will have new models for the Trans-Am, along with full technical support 
from Chevrolet. 
</P>
<P>
Kendall also is taking 16 units of economics at UCLA en route to graduation 
next year. He has a 2.9 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll make it, sooner or later, but it's getting tougher and tougher to make 
classes, take my exams, and still get to all the races and tests that we have 
scheduled," he said. 
</P>
<P>
SPRINT CARS -- The California Racing Assn. season will open this weekend at 
Manzanita Speedway in Phoenix with the Walt James Classic, a pair of 30-lap 
main events Friday and Saturday nights. Walt James was president of the CRA for 
21 years. Ron Shuman, of nearby Tempe, Ariz., will open defense of his Parnelli 
Jones Firestone/CRA championship in a new car. Shuman, who was left without a 
ride when his car owner, Ed Ulyate, decided not to campaign a car this season, 
has signed to drive the famous Tamale Wagon, owned by Alex Morales, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The CRA will race March 11 at Raven Speedway in Tucson before opening Ascot 
Park's 1989 season March 18. The non-winged sprinters will compete on 12 
different tracks in six states in a 56-race season that will last nine months. 
Thirty of the races will be at Ascot. 
</P>
<P>
MIDGETS -- The United States Auto Club's Jolly Rancher Candies Western States 
regional championship series will make its 1989 dirt track debut Saturday night 
and Sunday afternoon at the Imperial Fairgrounds, near El Centro. The races are 
part of the California Midwinter Fair. 
</P>
<P>
Indianapolis 500 veterans Rich Vogler and Johnny Parsons are scheduled to 
compete on the 3/8-mile oval. Vogler set a track record of 17.09 seconds last 
November, breaking Parsons' year-old record. The California contingent will be 
led by Sleepy Tripp, a two-time national champion who has won four regional 
championships, including last year's. He won 19 main events last season. Also 
entered are P.J. Jones, Robby Flock, Wally Pankratz and 1988 Turkey Night Grand 
Prix winner Chuck Gurney. 
</P>
<P>
MOTORCYCLES -- Speedway racers open their season Saturday night in the Coors 
Extra Gold Spring Series at Long Beach Veterans Stadium. National champion 
Steve Lucero will face a host of British League veterans, led by Sam Ermolenko. 
The two-race series will end March 10 at the Orange County Fairgrounds in Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
VINTAGE CARS -- The fourth annual La Carrera Classic, for cars 10 years old or 
older, will be held Saturday in Baja California on Highway 3, between Ensenada 
and San Felipe. Former stuntman Hal Needham set the record of 52 minutes for 
the 120-mile course last year while driving his NASCAR stock car.

CHRB MEETING DRAWS SEVERAL HORSE LAUGHS

HALLANDALE, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
That comical meeting of the California Horse Racing Board last week was 
straight out of Florida, where Gulfstream Park and Hialeah have made a running 
joke of their battle for the choice winter racing dates for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulfstream-Hialeah feud was so long-running that state racing authorities 
here finally deregulated the industry and told the tracks to settle the 
squabble themselves. 
</P>
<P>
But in California, the racing board can't sidestep the issues because it 
supposedly is the industry. Another meeting like last week's, however, and the 
commissioners will have enough seasoning to move on. They can audition for 
"Saturday Night Live," or try reviving vaudeville. 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, there weren't enough chairs to accommodate the 250 or so 
spectators who attended, and the meeting started 50 minutes late. It wasn't the 
kind of session that could be taken sitting down, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
An executive from Golden Gate Fields got up and asked the seven commissioners 
for permission to run races on Sundays. In reviewing the request, the board 
learned that Golden Gate had already been running on Sundays -- for the 
previous four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
One commissioner suggested that Golden Gate be fined $10,000, presumably for 
chutzpah. But another commissioner reminded that the track was under new 
ownership -- the Ladbroke group from London -- and a $10,000 penalty wouldn't 
make much of a welcome mat. Golden Gate was given a light reprimand, and 
allowed to continue racing on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
A little later, Richard Craigo, an attorney arguing a case for a horse owner, 
seemed to have his ducks in a row. The owner's horse won a race at Hollywood 
Park three months ago and been disqualified because he carried four pounds less 
than he should have. Craigo thought he had discovered a loophole in 
California's arcane racing rules. 
</P>
<P>
Besides losing the argument, Craigo also had to suffer Ray Seeley, the acerbic 
commissioner who asked the attorney if he was "hard up" for clients. 
</P>
<P>
The other commissioners blanched, and then Ben Felton, a board member whose 
arguments with Seeley are legend, wanted the remark stricken from the record. 
Seeley said that he meant what he said and wanted his comments to stand. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Felton and another commissioner apologized to Craigo, and then voted 
against him. So did Seeley, of course. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was run by the board chairman, Leslie Liscom, except when matters 
regarding Hollywood Park came up. Liscom has been accused by harness horsemen 
of possibly favoring Hollywood Park, because he works for an insurance concern 
that does $1-million worth of annual business with the track. 
</P>
<P>
Liscom's reduced role was voluntary. But until the conflict-of-interest charges 
are resolved, he will have little to do at board meetings. They are usually 
full of doings involving Hollywood Park, none of them funny enough to give 
vaudeville another chance. 
</P>
<P>
Gulfstream Park, which will be the host track for the seven Breeders' Cup races 
in November, is enjoying a good season despite the presence of a new state 
lottery, which at the start has hurt business at tracks in other states. Sunday 
racing at Gulfstream, also something new, is responsible for most of the 
track's gains. 
</P>
<P>
Gulfstream, however, is ahead about 6% in attendance over last year, it is up 
about the same in betting, and on Saturday it will run the Florida Derby, which 
traditionally produces the busiest day of the season. 
</P>
<P>
This year's Derby doesn't have Easy Goer, last year's 2-year-old champion and 
the future-book favorite for the Kentucky Derby, but he will make his debut as 
a 3-year-old by running in another stake on the card. 
</P>
<P>
The Florida Derby is a rematch of the Fountain of Youth Stakes, with an unknown 
ingredient from California thrown in. Dixieland Brass won the Fountain of Youth 
and on Saturday will run against the next five horses across the finish line 
that day -- Mercedes Won, Triple Buck, Big Stanley, Western Playboy and 
Traskwood -- plus three or four others. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkster, whose workouts at Hollywood Park have kept a permanent smile on 
trainer Ron McAnally's face, hasn't won since his victory in the Norfolk at 
Santa Anita on Oct. 15, but he has the look of other horses that came from 
California and won the Florida Derby. In 1983, it was Croeso at 85-1 and in 
1986 it was Snow Chief, the 3-2 favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Shoemaker and Johnny Longden won three Santa Anita Handicaps apiece in the 
1950s. In the 1960s, Shoemaker and Don Pierce each won three Big 'Caps. The 
1970s belonged to Laffit Pincay with three Big 'Cap victories. 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker, who has already won the Big 'Cap three times since 1980 -- on 
Spectacular Bid, John Henry and Lord at War -- could become the first jockey to 
win the race four times in a decade when the stake is run for the 52nd time 
Sunday. Retirement is imminent for the 58-year-old Shoemaker, who probably will 
be riding in his 35th and last Big 'Cap. 
</P>
<P>
All of Shoemaker's previous 11 winners were short-priced horses, and his mount 
Sunday, Payant, will be a longshot. Payant was 3-1 as an entry with Frankly 
Perfect when he finished fifth in the San Antonio Handicap on Feb. 12, but 
running separately he will be a much higher price Sunday. Payant, an 
Argentine-bred, has never won a stake in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest price for a Shoemaker Big 'Cap winner was Lucky Debonair's $8.20 in 
1966. In 1958, Shoemaker won with Round Table, whose $2.30 payoff was the 
lowest in stake history. 
</P>
<P>
Pincay, who will ride Super Diamond Sunday, could pick up his third Big 'Cap 
win of the 1980s. Pat Valenzuela, who rides favored Nasr el Arab, won the Big 
'Cap in 1984 with Interco. 
</P>
<P>
January brought the 20th anniversary of the race that included an alligator at 
the old Tropical Park in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 8, 1969, Hans II, a 5-year-old Argentine-bred, and jockey Bob Wholey 
won the fourth race at Tropical and Jack Wilson's chart footnotes in the Daily 
Racing Form read: 
</P>
<P>
"Hans II ran over an alligator on the course while saving ground at the first 
turn, split horses to take over leaving the far turn and, after dropping over, 
drew off with authority." 
</P>
<P>
Conquering an alligator would give a horse an authority complex, wouldn't it? 
But the alligator survived, too. A few days later, the Racing Form carried this 
item: 
</P>
<P>
"Tropical Park's celebrated alligator will be snatched out of his infield home 
sometime today by a Florida game warden and set loose in the Everglades, where 
it is hoped that he will prosper and multiply." 
</P>
<P>
Cryptoclearance, despite being known for his come-from-behind style, has won 
only one of 12 starts at 1 1/4 miles. He bled from the lungs while running 
third last Sunday in the 1 1/4-mile Gulfstream Park Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
After riding Cryptoclearance, Jose Santos skipped his mount in the next race to 
catch a plane back to New York and was fined $1,000 by the Gulfstream stewards. 
</P>
<P>
Cutlass Reality, whose most memorable victory came in last year's Hollywood 
Gold Cup, has been retired to stand at stud at Harris Farms in Coalinga, Calif. 
The 7-year-old earned more than $1.4 million in his career, the majority of it 
as a 6-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
His owners, Howard Crash and Jim Hankoff, indicated there is a possibility 
Cutlass Reality might return to the track after the 1989 breeding season. 
</P>
<P>
There is grumbling in quarter horse circles because four of the 68 voters 
failed to cast ballots in the horse-of-the-year election. The four missing 
votes could have swung the election another way. Merganser won the title with 
19 1/2 votes, just beating out Shawnes Favorite with 17 and Florentine with 15.

DELAHOUSSAYE WINS FEATURE ON GORGEOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gorgeous, ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye, scored her second victory in three 
career starts Wednesday, beating My Glamorous One, with Chris McCarron aboard, 
by three-quarters of a length in the $80,200 Santa Ysabel Stakes at Santa 
Anita. 
</P>
<P>
April Mon, ridden by Gary Stevens, finished third, another four lengths back, 
in the 1 1/16-mile race for 3-year-old fillies. 
</P>
<P>
Delahoussaye kept Gorgeous along the inside, and the filly set the pace most of 
the way, then held off My Glamorous One in the stretch drive. 
</P>
<P>
The 8-5 wagering favorite of the crowd of 21,488, General Charge, never 
threatened and finished fourth in the six-horse field, 12 lengths behind of the 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
Gorgeous, who carried 116 pounds and was clocked in 1:42 2/5, paid $9.20, $5.40 
and $3.40. My Glamorous One, carrying 117, returned $8 and $4.60. April Mon, 
114, paid $4.60 to show. 
</P>
<P>
Trained by Neil Drysdale, the daughter of Slew O' Gold earned $46,450 for owner

SEQUOIAS MAY BE DIFFICULT TO FELL IN JC STATE FINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
State championships don't grow on trees, but Valley College women's basketball 
Coach Doug Michelson wouldn't be surprised to see one hanging from Sequoias 
this Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
That's as in College of the Sequoias, which has a 33-3 record entering the 
eight-team California junior college championships at Valley College and is the 
top-seeded team from the northern half of the state. 
</P>
<P>
"I would think going in that Sequoias is the favorite . . . because most teams 
do not match up with its size and quickness," Michelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Sequoias routed defending state champion Santa Rosa, 71-44, to reach the 
quarterfinals, which begin at 2 this afternoon with Los Angeles Trade Tech 
(28-1) meeting American River College (26-4). 
</P>
<P>
Valley, making its second consecutive appearance in the state championships 
under Michelson, will play San Mateo at 6 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The field comprises four teams from each of the Northern and Southern regions. 
Valley (29-3), seeded third in the south and fifth in the state, has won 13 
games in a row and 19 of its past 20. 
</P>
<P>
"All eight teams are tough and there is a lot of parity in this tournament," 
Michelson said. "We are a very good shooting team and I like our chances." 
</P>
<P>
Michelson said that he expects San Mateo (29-1), the Northern region's No. 
2-seeded team, to run a zone defense against the Monarchs, who average 82.2 
points a game. Valley has three players who average 10 or more points: 
Sophomore center Ruth Aguilar (14.7), freshman forward Sandrine Rocher (12.1) 
and freshman guard Tisa Rush (11.5). 
</P>
<P>
San Mateo, the Golden Gate Conference champion, has won 21 games in a row and 
has not lost since Dec. 7. Sophomore forward Valencia Hedgebeth is averaging a 
team-high 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
Valley, which won the Western State Conference Southern Division title, 
advanced to the state championships with a 64-54 victory over Moorpark, 
rallying from an 11-point deficit. 
</P>
<P>
If Valley wins tonight, it will advance to the semifinals against the winner of 
the Fullerton-Contra Costa game. Fullerton (26-1) has won 15 consecutive games 
and is the top-seeded team from the Southern region. Contra Costa (28-8) is 
seeded fourth among Northern region teams. 
</P>
<P>
Sequoias will open against Golden West (14-16), the No. 4-seeded team from the 
Southern region, at 4 p.m.

(SEA) KINGS OF SOCCER; 
</P>
<P>
PALOS VERDES KICKERS, MAYBE THE BEST PREPS EVER, CAN MAKE HISTORY FRIDAY BY 
WINNING 33RD STRAIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY McALISTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Soccer aficionados have found reason to awake memories of great high school 
soccer teams in an effort to compare them with the reality of today's Palos 
Verdes Sea Kings, arguably the best high school team ever. 
</P>
<P>
That excitement stems from more than Palos Verdes' 32-0 record and the fact 
that they can be the first team in Southern Section history to extend it to 33 
Friday in the CIF 4-A championship game against Edison at 8 p.m. at Gahr High 
in Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
And it is more than just their second straight Bay League championship or 22 
shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been coaching for 19 years," said Newbury Park Coach Jimmy Rolland 
after his team fell Tuesday to Palos Verdes, 3-1, in the semifinals, "and this 
is the best team I have ever seen. These boys are well disciplined and well 
organized. In fact, they are the most organized and unselfish high school team 
I have ever seen. They can destroy Edison. If they lose the finals it will be 
the biggest upset in sports history." 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne Coach Bud Reagan, who lost to Palos Verdes three times this season by 
a goal total of 7-2, said the Sea Kings simply play the best soccer. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen better teams or, I should say, teams that should be better," said 
Reagan, whose team lost to Edison in the semifinals, 3-2. "But I haven't seen a 
team that looked strong and played up to their level (like Palos Verdes)." 
</P>
<P>
But, Reagan adds, talent and potential run short lives in soccer. Motivation 
and strength must be utilized to continue success. 
</P>
<P>
"It is amazing in an emotional sport like soccer that they can keep getting 
themselves up high enough to win every game," said Reagan, who has coached at 
Hawthorne for 10 years. "They are consistently good and don't make mistakes. I 
don't see Palos Verdes making errors in judgment. They are just so consistent. 
It was probably the best season for a team in this league." 
</P>
<P>
But before there was time for consistency and the Sea Kings were still learning 
each others' names, they decided to shoot for it all, aim for the zenith." 
</P>
<P>
It began with a 4-0 victory against Redondo in the South Bay Alliance 
Tournament, which Palos Verdes won by a combined goal total of 16-1, and 
continued through a 29-game regular season. 
</P>
<P>
And that season can only be defined with words like domination and superiority. 
The juggernaut rolled to 21 shutouts, allowed only 8 goals (a CIF record) and 
answered with 83. No opponent in the regular season scored more than one goal 
and Palos Verdes was not involved in an overtime contest until the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
It has been utter destruction. In 32 games, the Sea Kings have outscored 
opponents 91-11. 
</P>
<P>
Frightening as it may seem, Palos Verdes could have been even better if not for 
the injury of Jim Miller, who went down early in the season and has not played 
since. Miller was All-CIF last season. 
</P>
<P>
"In the game he got hurt in," Palos Verdes Coach Alan King explains, "he had 
five goals. If he was here our goal production would have been dynamite. But he 
is still our team captain and after he got hurt he said, "Let's go 
coast-to-coast. Let's win it all." 
</P>
<P>
And the Sea Kings are one step from fulfilling that goal. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be honest," King said. "I have never had a team like this. What do you do 
when you are undefeated all year and No. 1 all year? How do you play better? 
This team just doesn't want to lose." 
</P>
<P>
What they want is to bring home the CIF crown, a treasure that has eluded King 
since 1973 when he started the soccer program at Palos Verdes. King led his 
team to the semifinals in 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1981, 1983, 1985 and last 
year. Only in 1977 did the Sea Kings advance to the final, to lose 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
But King said the 1989 team may possess something different from teams of the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
"They know what the task is," he said. "These guys know their purpose and they 
go for that purpose. This team worked above their potential." 
</P>
<P>
That purpose is to start at the top and finish at the top without faltering. 
Posted in King's office is a reminder of the coast-to-coast aspiration, and 
embedded in the players' heads is its importance. 
</P>
<P>
"We were cocky," junior goalie Mark Antrobius said. "After the first game we 
knew nothing was going to stop us. Then, after we won a couple of games, we 
started thinking about going coast-to-coast." 
</P>
<P>
A 1987 All-CIF player, Gregg Swartz, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"We set a goal to go undefeated and win CIF," said Swartz. "Early on we got the 
feeling nobody could beat us. We didn't care who we played -- we just wanted to 
go coast-to-coast. We feel we can do it." 
</P>
<P>
So does Rolland, who said he feels confident Palos Verdes cannot lose. 
</P>
<P>
"They are the best," he said. "They may end up walking the final by 5 or 6 
goals." 
</P>
<P>
Even though there was no walking through the season, the Sea King players said 
they rarely felt pressure to win simply to keep the streak alive but rather to 
win for the sake of winning. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always worried about the game at hand," Antrobius said. "I just want to 
win. There is more pressure in the game than worrying about it (beforehand). 
I'd rather win CIF than worry about the streak. I don't care about All-CIF and 
stuff like that. I just want to win." 
</P>
<P>
Although Swartz concurs, he said he felt pressure during the Bay League season. 
</P>
<P>
"In the league season you find (the pressure) most," he said. "When you start 
playing three games a week, that is when it hit us. And once you hit CIF, every 
game can be your last." 
</P>
<P>
And when the next game draws more reporters than the last and television crews 
begin appearing, pressure is taken to another level. 
</P>
<P>
"The publicity really adds something," King said. "The press adds pressure, and 
the other day we had television cameras out here." 
</P>
<P>
But there will be no pressure like Friday's. 
</P>
<P>
"It is going to be unbelievable," Antrobius said. "We (knew we could beat) 
Hawthorne but have never played Edison." 
</P>
<P>
All agree that this championship game is intensified because of the undefeated 
streak and thoughts of becoming the greatest soccer team in Southern Section 
history. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel we can prove (we are) the best team ever," Swartz said. "We can do 
it."

WALZER GUIDES GRANT GIRLS INTO CITY SOCCER FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID O'BRIEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amanda Walzer, out of the Grant High lineup for nearly a month because of 
bruised ribs, showed no sign of rust in leading the Lancers to a 2-1 win over 
San Pedro in a girls' City Section semifinal soccer match Wednesday at Daniels 
Field in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
Walzer, a junior striker, scored both Grant goals, the second on a sweeping 
kick from 20 yards with 12 minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"She really played well, she surprised everybody," Grant Coach Frank Ortiz said 
of Walzer, the Lancers' leading scorer who had not played since crashing into a 
goal post in a match three weeks ago. "That lifted us, her coming out and 
showing so much determination." 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers (12-2-2) will meet undefeated Chatsworth on Saturday for the City 
championship. The site of the match has not been determined. Grant finished 
second to Chatsworth in the Northwest Valley Conference during the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro ends its season 12-1-2. 
</P>
<P>
Walzer scored seven minutes into the first half. After outrunning San Pedro's 
coverage, Walzer went one on one with goalie Elisa De La Pena and scored on a 
shot into the right side of the net. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro's Chellee Bennett scored on the rebound of a missed shot five minutes 
later for her team's only goal.

DIGEST: DELAVEAGA TOP PLAYER IN DISTRICT 3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steve deLaveaga of Cal Lutheran has been chosen National Assn. of 
Intercollegiate Athletics District 3 Player of the Year for the second 
consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-4 senior guard was the only Cal Lutheran player selected to the 
All-District 3 and All-Golden State Athletic Conference teams. DeLaveaga 
finished his career with a school-record 2,549 points. 
</P>
<P>
His averages of 28.1 points a game this season and 22.4 for his career are 
school records. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal State Northridge 400-meter relay team of Melvin Jones, Tyrone Jeffries, 
Tyrone Harlow and Chris Pippins qualified for the NCAA Division II 
championships with a 41.17-second clocking Sunday at the Long Beach Relays at 
Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
The Northridge quartet placed third in a race won by UCLA in 40.58. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge now has two qualifiers for the Division II championships, to be held 
in Hampton, Va., May 24-27. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Paul Albers, who qualified for the Division II meet in the hammer throw 
in a Feb. 18 meet at Northridge, improved his season best to 178 feet, 9 inches 
in a fourth-place finish at Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Norton, a fullback for Cal State Northridge in 1981 and '82, has been 
added to the football coaching staff as a graduate assistant. Norton, 28, will 
coach tight ends and help with the offensive line. He had been a football 
assistant at Calabasas High. 
</P>
<P>
The hire keeps the size of the Matador coaching staff at 11. Last week, Mark 
Lovett, CSUN's assistant in charge of running backs, resigned to become head 
coach at St. Genevieve High. Jim Clausen, who coached the Matador tight ends 
last season, will take over Lovett's duties. 
</P>
<P>
Providence High in Burbank has withdrawn its varsity baseball team from 
competition in the Delphic League, a Southern Section 1-A Division member, 
leaving the league with five members. 
</P>
<P>
Providence will play at the junior-varsity level against league opponents and 
has scheduled a series of nonleague varsity games against Small Schools 
Division teams. Providence will field a varsity team next season in the Small 
Schools Liberty League. Three years ago, Providence won the Small Schools 
championship behind pitcher Jeff Cirillo, now at USC. 
</P>
<P>
The Pioneers placed fifth in the Delphic League in '88 with a 2-8 record (4-17 
overall). A 34-3 league loss to Crossroads that was ended after three innings 
typified the season, Athletic Director Paul Sutton said. "That's not a learning 
experience," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Providence has suffered declining enrollment in recent years, dropping from 325 
boys and girls three years ago to 209 this year. The school announced Friday 
that it will continue to operate, quelling speculation that its doors would 
close after this school year. 
</P>
<P>
Melanie Clarke of El Camino Real High, the defending City Section champion in 
the high jump, was declared academically ineligible several weeks ago but could 
compete later this season if she improves her grades when the 30-week report 
cards are released in early April. 
</P>
<P>
The versatile senior led the Conquistadores to a third-place finish in last 
year's City championships by winning the high jump and placing third in the 400 
meters and long jump. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke has personal bests of 25.54 seconds in the 200, 56.63 in the 400, 5 
feet, 6 inches in the high jump, 17-10 in the long jump and 37-6 in the 
shotput. 
</P>
<P>
She led the 1988 Valley-area list in the 400 and was ranked no worse than fifth 
in either of the four events. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran guard Brenda Lee received honorable mention on the NAIA 
All-District 3 women's basketball team. She was second on the team in scoring 
with a 13.2 average and led the Regals in rebounding with an average of 9.7. 
</P>
<P>
The Master's College basketball team, which did not qualify for the NAIA 
District 3 playoffs, will compete in the National Christian College tournament 
beginning March 9 at a site to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
The American Roundball Corp. will conduct registration for teams of players 
grades 8 through 12 at North Hollywood High on Sunday and March 12 at noon. 
Signups also will be held at Camarillo High the same days at 5 p.m. for varsity 
and 7 p.m. for junior varsity. Registration is $75 with a $10 discount for cash 
payment.

<P>
For some, it's the thrill of a lifetime. For others, it's a steppingstone to 
the next stop, the Southern Regionals. 
</P>
<P>
Eight teams -- five making return engagements, three celebrating their coming 
of age -- vie for San Diego Section Division IV and V girls' and boys' 
basketball titles today and tonight at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good opportunity for us," Christian Coach Randy Wright said. "Not 
too many kids have the opportunity to play in the Sports Arena." Wright's 
Patriots (13-11) will take a measure of experience -- they defeated Mountain 
Empire for the Division IV title last year -- into their 8:30 game against 
Coronado (11-13), first-time visitors to the arena. 
</P>
<P>
Top-ranked Christian also has the distinction of coming from the City Central 
league, joining Lincoln (Division III) and San Diego (Division I) also in the 
Section finals. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been through the war with a lot of these teams," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
Coronado, picked to finished last in the 10-team 3-A Metro Conference, finished 
a surprising fourth. 
</P>
<P>
But Coronado Coach Bob Stanton knows what kind of competition his team will 
face. "Christian is going to be tough," Stanton said. "We have to get on 
(David) Jeremiah and work to break their press." 
</P>
<P>
Jeremiah is averaging 23 points and Darrell White 18. Tim Barkett has come on 
late in the season and has averaged 18 points in the last eight games. Coronado 
will rely on co-captains Jesse MacNeill (18-point average) and Derek Wastila 
(14). 
</P>
<P>
Wright said Christian's success will depend on "executing our offense and 
playing with poise and intensity on defense." 
</P>
<P>
At 4:30, Desert League rivals Calipatria (16-7) -- the defending Division V 
champion -- and Imperial (13-9) -- the Desert League champion -- meet for the 
sixth time this season, with Calipatria winning four out of the five played. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Moss is Calipatria's only returning starter, but Javier Vega and Vince 
Coleman, who came off the bench last year, add experience. Fourth-seeded 
Calipatria knocked off top-ranked Bishop's to advance to the championship 
round. 
</P>
<P>
For Imperial, Brian Williams is the player to stop, but the Tigers are hurt by 
the absence of Fabian Diaz, out with a badly sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' Division IV final, defending champion and top-ranked Holtville 
will play third-seeded Coronado at 6:30, a rematch of last's year's 
championship, which Holtville won. 
</P>
<P>
In the Division V game at 2:30, top-seeded Calvin Christian (23-1) will try to 
defeat second-seeded La Jolla Country Day (16-5) -- the defending Division V 
champion -- for the third time this season.

POINT LOMA STAR LEADS BY LEARNING

<TEXT>
<P>
She's all-assist, all-star and preseason All-American. She dishes, shoots, 
hustles and wins. But perhaps the best way to understand Monica Filer of Point 
Loma High School is to see how she deals with a loss. 
</P>
<P>
After all, she wins so much you get used to that. 
</P>
<P>
She is a four-year varsity player who was on the winning side in 137 of her 
first 138 high school games. Point Loma's record during her four years, 
including Tuesday's San Diego Section playoff semifinal victory over Poway, is 
119-5. Point Loma won San Diego Section 3-A championships in her freshman and 
sophomore seasons. 
</P>
<P>
This year, she already has set the state record for assists in a season with 
357. For her career, she has 737 -- a San Diego Section record. 
</P>
<P>
She is preparing to play her last game in San Diego, pending possible state 
tournament regional games. Appropriately, it will be the San Diego Section 
Division I championship game against City Eastern League rival Mira Mesa in the 
San Diego Sports Arena Saturday at 6:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
But let's cut to a loss. The Pointers had won 143 games in a row at home until 
New Year's Eve, 1988. That was when Chino beat the Pointers in Point Loma's Ben 
Fisher memrial tournament, 50-39. 
</P>
<P>
There was no pouting and no quitting. Just some agitated determination. 
</P>
<P>
"Monica told me later she learned from that game," Point Loma Coach Lee 
Trepanier said. "That's what it's all about. She took about eight three-point 
shots in the Chino game. She tried to do it all." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that is because she can do it all . . . or come awfully close. 
</P>
<P>
Winners learn from losses, and Filer said she didn't take the Chino loss hard. 
She said the Pointers were not facing tournament elimination, as they are now. 
</P>
<P>
"Losing just gets me ready to play ball," Filer said. "Our team doesn't get mad 
at each other after a loss. Sometimes a loss is best. It makes you work harder. 
On the court, you have to think the other team is your enemy. And a loss makes 
it easier to think that." 
</P>
<P>
Filer, a 5-foot-6 point guard and one of Street and Smith's magazine preseason 
All-American picks, is pretty good at viewing the opposition as the enemy. It 
is something she picked up from years of playing basketball. She has been 
playing since the fifth grade. 
</P>
<P>
"But it was my eighth-grade year when I decided I really wanted to make 
something of myself as a basketball player," she said. "And now, I go down to 
the rec center and play ball with the fellas." 
</P>
<P>
Said Trepanier said: "During the summers, and on Saturdays during the winters, 
she plays ball with the guys. The only way to get better is to play with people 
better than you." 
</P>
<P>
So she does. And she doesn't take any abuse, either. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll elbow them and push them, and they'll look at me like, 'Girl, what are 
you doing? Don't push me,' " Filer said. "I make one nice move and they say, 
'She's not gonna do that against me,' and they hustle more. Which makes me 
hustle." 
</P>
<P>
All of which trickles down to her play at Point Loma, giving her the confidence 
to go against any opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"One on one, there's no guard in San Diego who can hang with me," Filer said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Trepanier: "In my opinion, she's the best passer this county has ever 
seen. She can go to her left as well as any girl. Her left-handed layup is her 
better layup. She's also a pretty good shooter. People don't realize how much 
she works." 
</P>
<P>
She would rather make a good pass than a good shot. Her favorite move is to 
make a quick drive to the basket and dish off. 
</P>
<P>
"I really enjoy passing," she said. "At first, I wasn't much of a passer. Now, 
it's more handy to pass. The crowd gets into it, the team gets into it and I 
get into it. And it's not like just anyone can pass." 
</P>
<P>
Not just anyone can lead, either, but Trepanier called Filer, the Point Loma 
captain, the best captain he has had. What's more, she has a 3.0 grade-point 
average, with an interest in studying criminology in college. 
</P>
<P>
"She wants to be a winner," Trepanier said. "She wants to be the best. A coach 
is always looking for someone to be a captain, someone on the floor to take 
leadership. Last year, I didn't have a team leader. Monica was still young. 
This year, if someone is not doing a job, Monica gets after them." 
</P>
<P>
Said Filer: "It just comes naturally. I guess it's just the way I act. Everyone 
looks at me as Monica, and nobody gives me any lip. Sometimes I'll just look at 
someone and I don't even have to say anything."

SPORTS ET CETERA: MARC JONES WILL PLAY FOOTBALL AT WASHINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marc Jones, former Vista High School running back who is scheduled to be 
released from prison on Friday, has been awarded a scholarship to play football 
at the University of Washington and is expected to start classes on March 27. 
</P>
<P>
Jones has served eight months of a year's sentence in a minimum-security prison 
after pleading guilty to mayhem in connection with the beating and partial 
blinding of a Fallbrook teen-ager in an Aug. 29, 1987 incident. 
</P>
<P>
"We've evaluated him harder than any player I've evaluated in my coaching 
career, which is more than 30 years," Washington football Coach Don James told 
the Seattle Times. 
</P>
<P>
"His background is probably better than most players we bring in . . . He made 
one mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Jones, 19, rushed for 1,160 yards and was the most valuable player in the 
Palomar League his senior year. He also won all-state honors. 
</P>
<P>
SOCCER 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers have signed former Minnesota Striker and Los Angeles Lazer 
goalkeeper Tim Harris to a 10-day contract. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, who was 7-5 with a 5.12 goals-against average for Minnesota last 
season, will replace Felipe Hernandez starting Friday night when the Sockers 
play at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, who was 0-1 with the Sockers, already has been signed to two 10-day 
contracts this season, the most allowed by the Major Indoor Soccer League. 
</P>
<P>
WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 
</P>
<P>
Anja Bordt's game-high 36 points led St. Mary's (19-9, 12-2) to a conference 
championship and a 76-71 West Coast Athletic Conference victory over host 
University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Paula Mascari had 20 points and Rochelle Lightner added 13 for USD (10-17, 
6-8), which finished fourth in the conference.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Layla Massiroughli scored on a direct free kick from 23 yards with 12 minutes 
remaining to wake Torrey Pines from its first-half slumber and give the Falcons 
a 1-0 victory over Bonita Vista Wednesday in the 3-A girls' soccer semifinal 
match at San Diego High. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like we took the first half off," Torrey Pines Coach Dennis Costello 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines (16-4-2) surprised Costello this season, winning consistently with 
only three senior starters. The Falcons have three consecutive shutouts in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
In the other 3-A girls' semifinal: 
</P>
<P>
Poway 1, San Dieguito 0 -- Poway advanced to meet Torrey Pines, the defending 
champions, Saturday at 7:30 p.m. at Torrey Pines. 
</P>
<P>
In the 3-A boys' semifinal games: 
</P>
<P>

ERMA BOMBECK: FOR SALE: ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Erma Bombeck 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nowhere in the world will you find people with the same creative work ethic as 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
At the age of 4, one of my sons was going through the neighborhood dragging a 
little red wagon with our canceled checks in it. He was selling them for a 
penny a package. 
</P>
<P>
In the years that followed, all three of our kids went from selling 
watered-down lemonade to baby-sitting to delivering newspapers. As teen-agers, 
they were paid an allowance to breathe and to put gas in our own car, which 
they had driven to E in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
I personally taught them how to drop money each week into a ceramic pig on 
their nightstand. They taught me how to get the money out of the ceramic pig by 
inserting a kitchen knife in the slot and sliding the coins out to pay the 
paperboy. The message was set: You are never too young or too rich to make a 
few bucks if you use your imagination. 
</P>
<P>
We may have overdone it. 
</P>
<P>
Everything in this country is for sale. (What am I saying? The country is for 
sale.) You can rent out your bull for a stud fee. You can sell your seat at the 
Super Bowl and take an early retirement. You can pay someone to send your 
daughter cookies at college or write her a letter on her birthday. There's a 
man in Syracuse who will scoop dog droppings from your yard for $5 a week. If 
you have a need for $21,000, you could sell Napoleon I's toothbrush. A farmer 
in Oklahoma has offered the Soviet Union $1 million worth of wheat in exchange 
for a seat on a Soviet space flight. The name of the game is supply and demand. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't realize how far we had drifted until I read about a letter that 
appeared in the New York Times. A guy was standing in a line at the fish 
counter holding number 997. Number 793 was being served. As he stood there, a 
guy in a black leather jacket approached him and asked him what number he had. 
"For 10 bucks, I'll give you 873," he said. When the writer refused, he said: 
"How about 25 bucks for 840?" 
</P>
<P>
"You're scalping tickets at the fish counter?" the shopper asked in shock. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, pal," Mr. Black Leather Jacket said, "time is money." 
</P>
<P>
The story brought to mind a crusty old editor I used to work for in my early 
reporting days in Ohio. He stormed into the women's department one day and 
demanded to know why I had used a trade name for a soft drink in a story I had 
written. The tirade lasted an eternity. As the entire newsroom strained to 
listen, he ended by shouting, "Don't give it away when you can sell it." 
</P>
<P>
I didn't realize so many people heard him.

ART BUCHWALD: TRIGGERING MORE GUN CONTROL FUROR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Art Buchwald 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President George Bush, who wants to make this a kinder, gentler nation, moved 
in the right direction recently when he said that he was not interested in 
banning the importation of kinder, gentler semiautomatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
This declaration could not have come at a better time for the kinder, gentler 
National Rifle Assn., which lists the President as a lifetime member. Not only 
are the anti-NRA forces determined to stop the automatic weapons from being 
sold, but the police around the country are complaining that they can't 
maintain a benevolent and humane society when there are so many machine guns 
available to the citizens. 
</P>
<P>
It came as no surprise that Adolf Trigger, a gun dealer, was celebrating the 
Bush decision. He told me, "The President has sent a message in his kind and 
gentle way that as long as he is in office, Americans can buy any kind of gun 
they want to, be it Czech, Chinese or Israeli." 
</P>
<P>
I was glad to share in Adolf's happiness. "If I were leader of the Free World, 
I would want to have a completely armed America, too. Only an unkind and 
ungentle President would try to keep semiautomatic weapons out of the hands of 
hunters and sportsmen. Bush doesn't want the weapons to be used against 
schoolchildren, does he?" 
</P>
<P>
"Of course not. Nobody wants children to be shot by semiautomatic weapons. The 
President feels that we have to stop being so soft and lenient with our 
criminals. Guns should only be available to law-abiding citizens who won't use 
them to shoot each other in the back." 
</P>
<P>
"The President has a warm and benign heart, but how can he stop sales if the 
NRA fights any law requiring background information on a person buying a gun?" 
</P>
<P>
"No one ever said that separating the good gun buyers from the bad ones was 
easy," Adolf explained. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe the President will come up with a happy and sympathetic solution to the 
problem. I'm sure he feels awful every time there's a massacre with a firearm." 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Bush would like to do something about it, but he feels that gun control is 
an issue for individual states." 
</P>
<P>
"Why?" 
</P>
<P>
"That way he can devote all his time to talking about disarmament with the 
Russians. If a person is working for a kinder, gentler world, he doesn't want 
to be distracted with gang wars in his own back yard." 
</P>
<P>
"Do you think that Mr. Bush really agrees with the semiautomatic gun 
supporters, or is he just trying to placate them so that they won't get mad and 
go out and mow down a nursing home?" 
</P>
<P>
"George believes every word he says. He was a hunter long before he was a 
President. When he was running for office, he promised the NRA that he would 
never support any kind of gun registration because crime cannot be stopped by 
finding out who owns a gun and who doesn't. I'm not saying that the NRA elected 
him President of the United States, but we like to think that we were 
responsible for his tender and merciful landslide." 
</P>
<P>
"When Bush says that he will never do anything to prevent foreign hunting 
machine guns from flooding the United States, is he threatening the domestic 
gun industry?" 
</P>
<P>
"No," Adolf replied, "because we don't manufacture semiautomatic guns in this 
country. So, by importing the semiautomatics, we're not taking jobs away from 
the American worker. All the President wants is to make sure that they are 
available to the people who need them. That's why he will go down in history as 
the kindest, gentlest President the NRA ever had."

LEGAL VIEW: A LEASE DOES NOT HAVE TO BE A NOOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY S. KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles couple who recently rented an apartment didn't like what they 
found when they moved in. The upstairs neighbors were noisy, and the windows 
didn't have drapes or blinds. They also complain about a "non-refundable fee" 
the landlord demanded in cash and are even beginning to wonder if they can 
somehow get out of the lease they signed. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, non-refundable deposits are illegal in California. Whether it is 
called a pet fee, a security deposit or a cleaning fee, a deposit simply cannot 
be non-refundable. A landlord may retain only that portion of the deposit 
necessary to repair damages to the premises caused by a tenant, to clean the 
apartment or to cover unpaid rent. The rest must be returned. If it isn't, a 
tenant can sue the landlord in small claims court for the amount owed, as well 
as $200 in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unlawful Fee 
</P>
<P>
If you have paid your landlord a "non-refundable" fee, you might inform him 
that California Civil Code 1950.5 makes such a fee unlawful and that you expect 
him to consider it refundable. If he says you're all wet and will not be 
reasonable, you can contact the local district attorney, who might pursue a 
criminal action if the landlord has done this repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, the amount any tenant can be charged as a deposit, including last 
month's rent, is legally limited to not more than two months' rent for an 
unfurnished place, three months' rent for a furnished apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Can you get out of that lease because of noisy upstairs neighbors or missing 
drapes? Probably not. First, check the lease you signed to see if it says 
anything about providing drapes or other window coverings. If it does, you can 
remind the landlord of his contractual obligation to furnish drapes and even 
threaten a small-claims suit if friendly discussion and persuasion are 
unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
If not, and if the drapes were missing when you first inspected the property, 
the landlord may have meant to rent the place without them, and it will 
probably be difficult to persuade a judge that drapes were an implicit part of 
the bargain. 
</P>
<P>
Your noisy neighbors are probably not grounds for terminating the lease. If 
they are really a significant and continuing problem, you'll have to ask the 
local law enforcement authorities for help, or consider filing a nuisance 
action directly against the neighbors. On the other hand, if the lease contains 
rules about noise and parties on the premises, you can demand that the landlord 
enforce the house rules. 
</P>
<P>
All this does not mean that you are necessarily stuck in an apartment you can't 
stand for the full term of the lease. Any lease can be broken if you're ready 
to pay the consequences, and they don't have to be that much. 
</P>
<P>
But before you do anything rash, first review your lease to see if it allows 
you to sublease the premises. Most leases require a landlord's consent for 
this, and such consent cannot be withheld unreasonably. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, if you break a lease, the landlord can sue you and collect rent 
for the remainder of the lease. So if you have a one-year lease and depart 
after three months, you'll owe nine months' rent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legal Doctrine 
</P>
<P>
However, there is a legal doctrine called mitigation of damages that may make 
that amount much smaller. Everyone has a legal duty to mitigate damages. In the 
case of a lease, a landlord will have a legal obligation to try and find 
another tenant to replace you once you leave. And if within two months he finds 
a new tenant who can pay the same rent, then you owe only the two months' rent, 
plus any incidental charges, such as the cost of advertising the apartment. If 
he has to rent the place for less, then you will owe the difference. 
</P>
<P>
So if you're thinking of walking out on a lease, you should first check out the 
apartment market to see how easy it will be for the landlord to find another 
tenant. You may even want to advertise the apartment yourself and try to find a 
suitable tenant to move in as soon as you leave, thus avoiding any loss to the 
landlord at all. 
</P>
<P>
If you do decide to leave, give your landlord as much advance notice as 
possible, so he can try to find a replacement, and make it less likely that you 
will lose much by moving to a better, quieter place.

CROSSING SWORDS WITH INSURANCE FIRMS

Question: I enrolled with my family in the Blue Cross Prudent Buyer health plan 
a few years ago. About two years ago I gave birth to a premature baby who needs 
physical therapy to learn how to walk. The treatment is two or three times a 
week, and 80% was paid by Blue Cross. The cost is $125 for a 50-minute session, 
provided I use approved facilities, which are at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
As of Aug. 1, 1988, however, Blue Cross Prudent Buyer has limited all physical 
therapy they will pay for up to 12 sessions per year at $25 per session, again 
at Cedars-Sinai -- which means that I must pay the rest of the charge myself. 
As my son needs therapy two or three times a week, this is a great hardship on 
me. 
</P>
<P>
Blue Cross claims that they are legally correct because there is a sentence in 
the contract that allows them to change any, or all, rules, providing they give 
30-day notification to the consumer. This is fine if a new subscriber is given 
the opportunity to decide if he wants an insurance company without physical 
therapy benefits. But what about a subscriber, like me, who could not change 
policies because the child would be determined to have a "pre-existing 
condition"? 
</P>
<P>
Is it fair? Is it legal? Can the insurance companies put a sentence in their 
contract that exempts them from honoring the contract if they choose to? Could 
they decide tomorrow that dialysis or chemotherapy is no longer covered, even 
though the patient depends on it, and contracted for it? 
</P>
<P>
What can I do regarding this issue? -- Z.A. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: It's a tough one, all right, and the questions of "is it fair?" and "is 
it legal?" get caught in the realities of today's escalating medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, of course, it is legal for a health insurance company to change its rules 
covering benefits as long as both the subscribers and the California Department 
of Insurance are notified of those changes on a quarterly basis. Downward 
scaling of benefits, according to Charles Coleman, the public relations 
spokesman for Blue Cross of California, isn't done lightly, frivolously or 
selectively. 
</P>
<P>
It can't be done at all, in fact, unless the change in the benefits is applied 
to all subscribers -- not just those immediately impacted by the changes. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of physical therapy, Coleman adds, Blue Cross got hit by the 
double-whammy of "very high utilization and sharply escalating costs." As a 
result, the company "felt it necessary to either put restrictions on physical 
therapy or increase the premiums through the roof for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
A good part of the problem with physical therapy, according to Judy Penman, the 
underwriting services bureau supervisor for the California Department of 
Insurance in San Francisco, is that -- because of the large number of 
chiropractic patients using it -- "there has been a lot of overusage, and the 
insurance companies have come to regard this more as maintenance rather than as 
therapy and have sharply cut back the number of treatments covered. 
</P>
<P>
"Blue Cross," she continues, "changed their guidelines on physical therapy some 
time ago to restrict it to short-term therapy after an injury or surgery and, 
even then, found that the utilization far exceeded premiums and that if they 
were to increase the premiums to cover unlimited therapy it would be 
exorbitant. They've got several different plans -- one limits the subscriber to 
12 visits a year, another limits him to 25." 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Insurance's Penman wonders, however, if your son's use of 
physical therapy as a corrective treatment was taken into account under Blue 
Cross' own guidelines, or whether someone, arbitrarily, simply decided that it 
was being used for maintenance. In her discussions with Blue Cross 
representatives about your case, however, she did discover a few cases that 
were considered by Blue Cross to be exceptional -- one involved a child with 
multiple sclerosis -- and a compromise physical therapy regimen, and premium 
structure, was worked out. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Penman assured us that she is writing to you for more 
information -- you neglected to give me your policy number for instance, or 
your phone number, or she would have contacted you by now. She promises to 
investigate your case thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
Both Penman and Blue Cross' Coleman suggest that you write to Blue Cross 
yourself, requesting a "Medical Review Board hearing." This in-house review 
will look into it and make sure that Blue Cross' own guidelines were followed, 
that you weren't the victim of someone's arbitrary action, and will see if you 
qualify for any sort of compromise arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
"If she gets turned down there," Penman adds, "there's one last option open to 
her. She can request a 'Medical Society Review' from Blue Cross. This will 
bring in outside doctors to investigate the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
We still can't hold out a big, beaming ray of sunshine for you. Blue Cross -- 
and it's a position in which the state's Judy Penman agrees -- is leery of 
making exceptions in matters like this. But you still have a couple of doors to 
open first. 
</P>
<P>
Ask for the Medical Review Board hearing by writing to Rebecca Kapustay, vice 
president, operations, Individual and Small Group Division, Blue Cross of 
California, P.O. Box 70000, Van Nuys, Calif. 91470. 
</P>
<P>
Good luck, but don't build your hopes up too much, yet. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I was interested in your recent column about the elderly gentleman who was 
pressured into taking additional life insurance that he neither needed nor 
wanted. It certainly is a complex field, and I'm wondering if there are any 
guidelines for someone who suspects that he does need more insurance. -- B.J. 
</P>
<P>
A: There's some pretty good literature on the subject you might study. One is 
an 11-page booklet that is available without charge right here in the state. 
Write to the California Department of Insurance, 600 S. Commonwealth Ave., Los 
Angeles, Calif. 90005, and request a copy of "The Buyer's Guide to Life 
Insurance." The department also has a toll-free hot line number for consumers 
with insurance questions: (800) 233-9045. 
</P>
<P>
A more comprehensive look at the life insurance industry is also available from 
Consumer Reports Books, "Life Insurance: How to Buy the Right Policy From the 
Right Company at the Right Price" (290 pp, $12, Consumer Reports Books, 110 E. 
42nd St., New York, N.Y. 10017).

As jazz greats gathered in New York on Wednesday to pay final respects to 
trumpeter Roy Eldridge, they learned that another jazz trumpeter, Woody Shaw, 
had lost his left arm in a freak accident. Shaw, 44, who is legally blind, 
tumbled down a flight of stairs at a Brooklyn subway station Monday morning and 
rolled off the platform into the path of an oncoming train. His left arm was so 
badly mangled that doctors had to amputate it. The accident was revealed by the 
pastor conducting Eldridge's funeral service. ALEENE MacMINN

The British Broadcasting Corp. issued new guidelines Wednesday aimed at keeping 
gratuitous sex and violence -- as well as supporters of Irish nationalist 
guerrillas -- off the air. "Scenes of violence, sex, great distress or 
inclusion of bad language are all considerations which can affect the most 
suitable placing in the schedules," the new guidelines say. "A good rule of 
thumb is to avoid taking the audience by surprise except for a very good 
reason." Violence should never be gratuitous, dead bodies should not been shown 
unless there are "the most compelling reasons for doing so" nor should there be 
undue focus in the news on the bloody aftermath of a terrorist attack. 
Producers were told that while sex had been more explicit on television in 
recent years, they were more limited than film makers in what they could show 
because their programs were viewed by families at home. British television 
shows nudity, but only after 9 p.m. ALEENE MacMINN

Actress Lynn Redgrave's daughter Annabel is 8 now, but her mother and father, 
John Clark, are still claiming that Redgrave had the right to breast-feed her 
while on the job. The Clark-Redgrave crew was at the posh St. James' Club in 
West Hollywood on Wednesday to update the media on the progess of their dispute 
with MCA/Universal over Redgrave's 1981 firing from the "House Calls" TV 
series. (The dispute, which has been in and out of courts ever since, revolves 
around counterclaims that Redgrave was forced to leave the show because she 
insisted on breast-feeding infant Annabel on the set.) One court has ruled that 
the dispute has been settled, but the state Supreme Court is now weighing the 
case. She's asking for about $500,000 in attorneys fees and a written apology 
published in the Hollywood trade papers. "This is our last chance," Redgrave 
said. "We want to prove this is a matter of public interest . . . . more a 
matter of principle than money." ALEENE MacMINN

PHILHARMONIC CHAMBER MUSIC CONCERT AT GINDI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY McQUILKIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having left you in such a state of good humor, the musicians almost made you 
forget the fact that they had delivered crackerjack performances at Gindi 
Auditorium, site of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Chamber Music Society concert 
Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Seven instrumentalists -- drawn mostly from the younger generation of 
Philharmonic players -- brought punch and point to Stravinsky's "Histoire du 
Soldat," the closing work. Each played with clarity and nearly spotless 
precision; together they produced a reading with driving momentum and unusual 
tautness. Heading up the band was Camille Guastafeste, who played with devilish 
panache; joining her were clarinetist David Howard, bassoonist Patricia Kindel, 
bassist Christopher Hanulik, trumpeter Rob Roy McGregor, trombonist Herbert 
Ausman and percussionist Raynor Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
Gail Eichenthal, the KUSC announcer whose mellifluous voice introduces 
Philharmonic broadcasts, narrated. Using a text adapted from the original by 
Alan Parker and herself (the additions being mostly humorous updatings), she 
read with relaxed poise. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, violinist Judith Mass, violist Meredith Snow and cellist Gloria Lum 
gave a compelling account of Beethoven's Trio in G, Opus 9, No. 1. Superb 
control, flawless balances and absolute precision of ensemble helped make this 
a truly memorable reading. The three generated a remarkable degree of tension, 
tempered by lyricism and refinement. The music flowed with a ceaseless feeling 
of direction and the Finale virtually bubbled over with good-natured 
ebullience. 
</P>
<P>
By intermission, one might well have forgotten the more sober -- relatively 
speaking -- reading of Hindemith's Sonata in C that opened the concert, had it 
not been for the taste with which violinist Barry Socher and Zita Carno 
delivered the brief work. TERRY McQUILKIN

STAGE WATCH : TWO CITIES WOO ODYSSEY IN HUNT FOR SPACE; ANOTHER CHAPTER IN 
ACTORS' WAIVER LAWSUIT 
</P>

On the move: 
</P>
<P>
The Odyssey Theatre Ensemble must leave its quarters in West Los Angeles by the 
end of June. The new owner of the building at Santa Monica Boulevard and Bundy 
Drive reportedly plans to lease it to a tenant who will convert it into a video 
rental emporium. 
</P>
<P>
A total triumph for canned entertainment over live theater? 
</P>
<P>
Not quite. The Odyssey, moving into its 20th anniversary season, will relocate, 
although its next address is still unknown. 
</P>
<P>
"We're madly scampering about for an interim site," said Odyssey artistic 
director Ron Sossi. The company has been looking for a new permanent site for 
some time, but now "we've got to get something locked in by March 15," said 
Sossi. "We want to re-open in July, so we want to get in (to the new space) by 
May 1. That will give us two months to convert it." 
</P>
<P>
The conversion will be a big job, for none of the sites currently under 
consideration is an existing theater -- and the Odyssey "will try to cram in 
three theaters (the number of spaces in the Odyssey's present building) 
wherever we go." 
</P>
<P>
Sossi's loyalties are divided between Santa Monica and Los Angeles. Santa 
Monica has been aggressively pursuing the Odyssey -- to the extent that Dennis 
Zane, the city's mayor, has personally driven around town, searching for a 
site. "The community and the Odyssey have a nice fit," said Zane. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles offers the lure of the new Los Angeles Endowment for the Arts as a 
potential funding source. "We require some sort of community subsidy," said 
Odyssey board president Dan Attias. Several Los Angeles city council members 
are assisting the Odyssey's search for a Los Angeles site. 
</P>
<P>
Two possible sites are in each city. One of the Los Angeles sites -- a 
warehouse at Westgate and Mississippi, just north of Olympic Blvd. -- isn't far 
from where the theater is now. It would require a rent increase (over the 
$6,000 the Odyssey pays now) "for considerably less space," said Sossi -- but 
at least it's immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
The other Los Angeles site, a garage at 2055 Sepulveda Blvd., would not be 
available until mid-summer -- and would therefore necessitate the rental of a 
temporary home while conversion to a theater took place. But it's a likelier 
permanent site than the warehouse. Because the garage is currently owned by the 
city, it would open up opportunities for a subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Monica, Sossi's favorite site is the Santa Monica Airport, where an 
old hangar is a possibility. The city would arrange a low-rent deal for the 
airport site, if it becomes available. 
</P>
<P>
Another possibility would be the incorporation of the theater into several of 
the new developments along the Santa Monica Mall. But these buildings aren't 
large enough to accommodate three theaters plus support facilities, so the 
Odyssey operations would have to be split among several locations. 
</P>
<P>
Sossi said the Odyssey will not leave the West Side, where most of its audience 
lives. However, Attias added that the theater might move to temporary quarters 
in Hollywood while a new permanent home is being arranged or converted. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Padua Hills Playwrights Festival has found a new home. The encampment 
of playwrights and students, who have recently migrated to a new venue each 
year, will dig in at Cal State Northridge this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The base of operations will be Cal State Northridge's Art and Design Center, on 
the north side of the campus, though the theater department facilities on the 
south side of the campus may be used for student readings. The university will 
provide "a minimal amount of housing, enough to accommodate the staff people 
from out of town," said Padua Hills artistic director Murray Mednick. Several 
university students will study with the Padua Hills faculty and/or be hired as 
technical assistants. 
</P>
<P>
The program will begin in late June, with alfresco public performances of six 
to eight plays in late July and early August. The Art and Design Center "has an 
interesting look, especially at night," said Mednick. "Modernist but not 
concrete. It's a tempting look." 
</P>
<P>
The Padua Hills faculty this year will include Jon Robin Baitz, Eduardo 
Machado, David Henry Hwang, John Steppling, John O'Keefe, Julie Hebert, Martin 
Epstein, Leon Martell and Lin Hixson. 
</P>
<P>
 -- As previously reported, the Ensemble Studio Theatre is leaving its 
two-theater home, the former Los Angeles Actors' Theatre near Santa Monica and 
Western Avenue. Part of the group now plans to reconstitute at another 
location, a former Equity Waiver theater on the West Side. Facing mounting 
debts, the group may have to declare bankruptcy and re-organize under a new 
name, but no definite decision has been made, said general manager Sean Orcutt. 
</P>
<P>
RUMBLINGS: That lawsuit instigated against Actors' Equity last year by 15 actor 
members dissatisfied with the manner in which the union went about modifying 
the Waiver won't go away. 
</P>
<P>
Plaintiffs George Ball, Barbara Beckley, Maria Gobetti, Adam Carl, Gary 
Grossman, Salome Jens, Valerie Landsburg, Dorothy Lyman, Amanda McBroom, Allan 
Miller, Greg Mullavey, Tom Ormeny, Linda Purl, Joseph Stern and Michael Wadler 
recently made an offer to settle out of court. They outlined conditions mostly 
designed to give some control over the new 99-Seat Theater Plan to local union 
members. According to Jerome Birn, the plaintiffs' pro bono attorney, Equity 
found "virtually all" of the proposal unacceptable, but officials offered to 
"meet in person with the plaintiffs in the near future to discuss a 
settlement." 
</P>
<P>
"(What's disturbing is that) the union can unilaterally do whatever (it wants 
to the plan) and never go back to the membership," Birn said. "Its position is 
that the L.A. vote is informational and has no constitutional validity. Only 
(Equity council in) New York decides." 
</P>
<P>
Edward Weston, Equity's Western Regional Director, refused to comment. Union 
attorney Leo Geffner is in Hawaii and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, "the union has taken the position that they want all (subpoenaed) 
documents to be subject to a confidentiality agreement," Birn said. "I don't 
see why." 
</P>
<P>
A hearing with a magistrate on the confidentiality issue has been set for the 
third week in March. 
</P>
<P>
SUCH A DEAL: How much would you pay to see "Dutch Landscape" at the Mark Taper 
Forum if you could name your price? On the first night of the Taper's new 
"pay-what-you-want" policy Tuesday, 23 people paid as little as three cents and 
as much as $10. Regular ticket prices are $20-$26.

The West Coast portion of the tour by the Osipov Balalaika Orchestra, including 
performances at the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim March 3 and at Ambassador 
Auditorium in Pasadena March 4, has been canceled. The producers, Classical 
Artists International, say that the company will be back in 1990, with a 
restructured tour of three- or four-performance engagements, rather than the

<P>
The opening tune of the Jazz Birds' second set at the Grand Avenue Bar at the 
Biltmore Hotel Tuesday evening told the whole story: "Dynamite Ladies." 
</P>
<P>
The tune, an up-tempo, bopish piece composed by Walter Davis, was one of seven 
inclusions in an early evening set and pointed to but one of the styles this 
group of jazz-minded women could explore with vitality and style. 
</P>
<P>
Forming the two-horn front line of the quintet were Stacy Rowles and Betty 
O'Hara, both established names on the male-dominated jazz scene. Rowles, whose 
trumpet and fluegelhorn playing reflects the influence of Clark Terry, 
performed superbly in each outing. So, too, did O'Hara, whose horns include 
cornet, valve trombone and the double-belled euphonium and whose vocal on Billy 
Strayhorn's "Lush Life" was a gem. 
</P>
<P>
The group, which featured pianist Liz Kinnon, bassist Mary Ann McSweeney and 
drummer Jennette Wrate, swung consistently in every outing. And each outing was 
made more pleasurable by the fact that the arrangements were well-conceived and 
thoroughly rehearsed. The Jazz Birds flew to this gig on ready wings. 
</P>
<P>
Dizzy Gillespie's "Manteca" provided a Latin flavor that alternated with more 
traditional swing sections. The alternating fields gave each soloist the 
opportunity to explore the tune in greater depth. 
</P>
<P>
Pianist Kinnon, whose accompanying efforts were solid and whose solo moments 
were inspired, contributed a lovely jazz waltz, "J.J." Wrate spurred the piece 
with brushes and bassist McSweeney offered one of several fine solos. 
</P>
<P>
Joining the group for a couple of guest outings was violinist Karen Briggs. 
"Killer Joe" was a perfect solo vehicle for a compelling statement and "Elm," a

THE BUTCHER: BUFFALO ROAM AGAIN -- NOW TO U.S. TABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MERLE ELLIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The American bison is back. There are more buffalo grazing on the grasses of 
this nation now than there have been since the mid-1800s. According to the 
American Bison Assn. in Denver and the National Buffalo Assn. in Ft. Pierre, 
S.D., there are between 60,000 to 80,000 head of bison in America and another 
10,000 to 20,000 in southern Canada. 
</P>
<P>
That's not many compared to the estimated 60 million that inhabited North 
America when Columbus discovered it in 1492, or even compared to the 20 million 
that still roamed the Great Plains in the 1850s. But compared to the 254 that 
existed in the entire world (one was in a zoo in Calcutta, India) in 1910, I 
think it is safe to say the American bison is making a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
There seem to be three major reasons why the past few years have seen an 
accelerated growth in people's interest in the buffalo, according to several of 
the producers I have talked to across the country. 
</P>
<P>
One is the tremendous interest that has developed in the past decade or so 
(since the Bicentennial in 1976, I think) in American cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever that is, it must include the American bison. The only other meat 
products that I can think of truly indigenous to America are the country ham 
and feedlot beef. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Protein, Less Cholesterol 
</P>
<P>
The second reason has to do with perceived or perhaps real, but in any case 
well publicized, health benefits of buffalo meat. Buffalo is reported to have 
25% to 30% more protein than most other domestic meats, less than half the 
cholesterol and about one third the fat and calories. I'm not sure I "buy" all 
that, but then I have come to suspect any nutritional claim made by almost 
anybody who wants to sell me something. What I do buy when I buy buffalo is 
taste. Buffalo steak comes about as close to being what a good steak should be 
as any steak I've had in a long time. 
</P>
<P>
I find it interesting that all of the millions of American bison that were 
slaughtered on the Western Plains in the late 1800s were not killed for their 
meat. It was the buffalo hide that was prized. Buffalo hides brought as much as 
$1,500 in London and Paris. That's a lot of money even today. Imagine how much 
it was in 1880. The only other part of the buffalo that was not left to rot in 
the hot prairie sun was the tongue. That was the only part the "white man" had 
any taste for. 
</P>
<P>
In 1870, according to Western historian Sam Arnold, 72 freight cars loaded with 
nothing but buffalo hides and tongues were shipped out of Denver to the East. 
Tongue today is not as popular as it once was, nor are hides; 'tis buffalo 
steak that folks have discovered a taste for. "Buffalo steak," Sam said, 
"tastes the way a beef steak would like to taste." 
</P>
<P>
Arnold grills the steaks over charcoal, after first coating both sides well 
with oil. After turning, the steaks are seasoned with his own Western Seasoning 
Salt; a mixture of 1/3 garlic salt, 1/3 red pepper, 1/3 black pepper and 1/3 
lemon crystals. (Lemon crystals can be found in the spice section of most 
supermarkets; in drug stores, where they're labeled "citric acid crystals"; or 
in Jewish deli's, where they will likely be called "sour salt.") 
</P>
<P>
While you are not apt to find buffalo meat in the meat case of your local 
supermarket in the immediate future, at the rate the national herd of American 
bison is growing it won't be long. There are a growing number of ranchers, 
large and small, raising buffalo. Some like the Hulk Ranch in Pierre, S.D., 
have 3,000 head or more; others, like Wray and Roma Dawson at Phistlewood Farms 
in Chantilly, Va., have only 75 to 80 head. "They're fun to raise," Roma told 
me, "good to eat, and they kind of help us make ends meet." 
</P>
<P>
Most producers sell to consumers by direct mail either from their own 
USDA-inspected plant or through a USDA-inspected processor. All sell steaks and 
roasts and ground buffalo, some sell buffalo sausage products and jerky and a 
few even sell that Epicurean delight of days gone by -- buffalo tongue. Here 
are some places you can buy buffalo today.

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: GETTING TO BOTTOM LINE OF THE CHOLESTEROL-LOWERING 
PROPERTIES OF OATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are three statements we can make with assurance about oats. One, a bowl 
of oatmeal or cold oat cereal served with low-fat milk is an excellent 
breakfast food. Two, the fiber in oats seems to lower cholesterol. And three, 
the importance of oats in this latter role has been exploded way out of 
proportion. All the hype has accompanied steady streams of new products -- some 
oat-based and others containing little more than "essence of oats" -- that are 
inundating the supermarket shelves. 
</P>
<P>
The oat and serum-cholesterol link is not as new as you might think. It was 
established 25 years ago when researchers fed a group of 21 volunteers almost 
five ounces of rolled oats, baked into bread, for three weeks. At the beginning 
of the study, the subjects' cholesterol averaged 251 milligrams, a figure 
within the high-risk range for coronary heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of 21 days, levels had dropped 11%. According to current 
recommendations, the subjects would now fall into what the National Cholesterol 
Education Program terms the "borderline to high category." The result is 
impressive, but a very heavy dose of oats was involved. When the special 
oatmeal bread was replaced with regular bread, within two weeks cholesterol 
levels had climbed back almost to where they had been when the study began. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cholesterol Levels Dropped 
</P>
<P>
Since then, several investigators have confirmed and expanded the 
cholesterol-lowering finding, using rolled oats, oat bran and a mixture of oat 
bran and beans. Of particular interest are two studies in which subjects were 
asked to consume more moderate amounts of oat fiber. In both investigations, 
average cholesterol levels were below the recommended 200 milligrams per 
deciliter. In one, reported three years ago, 208 volunteers were first placed 
on a fat-modified diet. Less than 30% of the calories they ate came from fat, 
and dietary cholesterol intake was less than 250 milligrams per day. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of six weeks, cholesterol levels had dropped a little more than 5%. 
At that point, subjects were divided into three groups. In one, 60 grams of oat 
bran replaced a calorically equal amount of carbohydrate. In a second group, 60 
grams of oatmeal was used in place of a calorically equal amount of 
carbohydrate. A third continued with the basic diet. After the second six 
weeks, serum-cholesterol levels among those whose diets included the oats 
dropped about 3% more. 
</P>
<P>
And in a small study reported last year, 72 volunteer medical students were 
divided into three groups and given one of three types of muffins. One 
contained wheat, a second wheat and oats, and a third, oats. After 28 days, 
cholesterol levels among those taking just 17 grams of oat bran (a little over 
half an ounce) fell about 5% from 179 to 170 milligrams per deciliter of blood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Research Supports Findings 
</P>
<P>
And significantly, it was the LDL, or low-density lipoprotein, cholesterol 
fraction -- the type associated with higher risk of heart disease -- that fell. 
Levels of HDL-cholesterol, the "good" type that helps prevent arteries from 
clogging, remained unchanged. In terms of oat bran, the amount used in this 
study translates to about two-thirds cup of cooked oat bran or one cup of 
cooked oatmeal. 
</P>
<P>
The upshot of this research is that oat bran, either plain or in oatmeal or 
cold oat cereal, does appear to help lower serum cholesterol. But we must 
highlight the word help. The hefty amounts of oat bran used in earlier studies 
clearly are not appropriate to consume day-in, day-out. And if taken in the 
reasonable amounts used in the medical-student study by someone whose 
cholesterol level was, say, 253 milligrams per deciliter, the resulting 5% that 
might occur would still put cholesterol levels in the high-risk range, more 
than 240 milligrams. So adding oats is no license for shedding a diet low in 
fat, especially saturated fat and cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Check Ingredient Lists 
</P>
<P>
And by the way, when it comes to buying oat products, be sure to read the 
labels carefully. You know what you are getting when you buy oatmeal or some of 
the traditional types of cold oat cereals. But with newer products the picture 
quickly muddies. 
</P>
<P>
Some oat cereals, which may contain considerable oat bran, also contain highly 
saturated coconut oil. In oatmeal bread, oats may be so far down on the 
ingredients list that the amount contained is small. Others, like a package of 
cookies we examined recently in which oat bran appeared after juice concentrate 
in the ingredients list, contain an insignificant quantity of oat bran. 
</P>
<P>
And still others, such as potato chips dusted with oat bran, are too outrageous 
to deserve comment. 
</P>
<P>
Pantothenic Acid Pills OK for Chickens, Not Humans 
</P>
<P>
Question: I was in a health-food store with a friend recently when she bought 
some pantothenic acid pills as a treatment for dermatitis. She said it was a 
nutrient, but I had never heard of it. What is it? And is there any reason to 
think it might work? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Not unless your friend is a chicken, and even then under usual 
circumstances she wouldn't need it. Pantothenic acid is one of the B vitamins. 
It is associated with dermatologic problems in animals fed experimental diets 
deficient in the vitamin. Back in the 1930s a severe dermatitis developed in 
chicks fed a special diet. The condition could be reversed by giving the birds 
a preparation made from liver, which was labeled the "chick anti-dermatitis 
factor" and soon identified as pantothenic acid. 
</P>
<P>
The vitamin is necessary to health; it participates in a great variety of 
reactions in the body. But here's why your friend was bringing coals to 
Newcastle: Pantothenic acid is so widely available, present in so many foods, 
that there is little reason to be concerned about getting enough. The name 
itself comes from the Greek pantothen, which means "from everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it took researchers years to produce experimental pantothenic acid 
deficiency in humans, and they succeeded only by using a vitamin antagonist 
along with the purified diet. There were no dermatologic symptoms associated 
with the deficiency, by the way. And there is no reason to believe it would be 
of benefit in treating skin conditions with no nutritional cause. 
</P>
<P>
Among the best food sources of pantothenic acid are liver, kidney, egg yolk, 
wheat bran and fresh vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have always been curious to know how puffed cereals are made, other than 
that they are "shot from guns." Can you explain the process? 
</P>
<P>
A: The principle involved resembles popping corn. In making puffed cereals, the 
starchy endosperm of the wheat or rice kernel is first cooked to gelatinize the 
starch and then partially dried. Or, sometimes, a mash of cereal dough is 
pressed into moist pellets. At this point the kernels are placed in a puffing 
gun, where they are heated under very high pressure and very hot temperature, 
converting the moisture in the kernels to steam. 
</P>
<P>
The gun is then opened, the steam under pressure within the kernels expands 
explosively and the kernels puff. They are then toasted, sometimes sugar 
coated, and then dried. Rice may also be oven puffed, a process in which the 
grain is cooked, rolled flat, and then toasted quickly, where blistering 
lightens the grain. 
</P>
<P>
Puffed cereals are among the oldest members of the dry-cereal industry. 
According to Harold McGee, in "On Food and Cooking: The Lore of the Kitchen" 
(Charles Scribner's Sons), they were the creation of Alexander Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
In experiments conducted at the New York Botanical Gardens, he filled test 
tubes with cereal starch, then sealed and heated them. When they shattered, a 
porous puffy mass of starch emerged. He then repeated the experiment with whole 
grains. And working at Quaker Oats, in Chicago, he developed the first 
steam-injected puffing guns. Puffed rice was first sold at the St. Louis 
World's Fair in 1904 as a snack food. A year later, it was marketed as a 
breakfast cereal. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I really enjoyed your recent column about easy-to-prepare, low-fat soups. I 
have an additional request: We are very fond of lentil soup, but most of the 
recipes I've seen include much too much fat. The few I have tried that had less 
fat did not turn out well. Do you have a suggestion.? 
</P>
<P>
A: We recently came across a lentil soup that fills the bill nicely. Saute a 
large chopped onion and one cup chopped celery in two tablespoons oil until 
lightly colored. Place in a large pot. Wash one pound of lentils and add them 
to the pot. Add eight cups water, a 12-ounce can of plain tomato sauce, a 
little salt and plenty of black pepper. Simmer until the lentils are tender, 
about an hour or so. Then add one or two bunches of roughly chopped escarole. 
</P>
<P>
A serving of the soup has 295 calories and as much protein as two ounces of 
meat, and it is virtually fat free. The escarole not only contributes to the 
flavor, but provides generous amounts of beta carotene, which the body converts 
to Vitamin A. You may, if you want, add a cup or two of diced potatoes or 
carrots or both when the lentils are just tender. The soup can be topped with 
Parmesan cheese. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I know that different studies have presented conflicting information about 
the link between coffee drinking and heart disease. Has anyone checked into 
whether different brewing methods might be a factor? 
</P>
<P>
A: Researchers from the Tromso, Norway, heart study recently focused on just 
that question, using a group of 18,000 men and women between the ages of 20 and 
59. They were asked how many cups of coffee they drank each day and what method 
was used to prepare it. By far the most common method was boiled coffee, a 
process in which the grounds are in longer contact with the water than in other 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, 8% of the subjects drank boiled coffee most or all of the time. Next 
most popular was filtered coffee, while decaffeinated and instant coffee were 
used only rarely. Only 7% of the men and 9% of the women drank no coffee. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators found that serum-cholesterol levels rose significantly with 
increasing coffee consumption only among those who drank boiled coffee. Indeed, 
among men who consumed a formidable 9 cups of coffee or more a day, cholesterol 
concentrations were 11% higher than among men who drank none. In women, the 
difference was 8%. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators suggest that differences in brewing methods may help explain 
the fact that their results differ from those of other groups who have found no 
effect. They suggest that some unidentified substance in coffee may affect 
cholesterol levels. In Norway, the combination of high consumption and 
widespread use of boiled coffee may represent a special case. Indeed, they 
suggest that in Finland, some of the decline in serum cholesterol may well be 
attributed to a change in brewing methods since the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I read a new potentially harmful substance has been discovered in alcoholic 
beverages. Can you tell me about it? 
</P>
<P>
A: A compound called urethane, or ethyl carbonate, forms as a by-product during 
the manufacturing of certain alcoholic drinks. It has been shown to cause 
cancer in some laboratory animals. The compound forms during fermentation and, 
if heated during the processing of alcohol, levels can increase. To some 
extent, therefore, the effect is unavoidable. 
</P>
<P>
Levels also may be affected by the soil in which grapes are grown, the variety 
of grape used and even the weather. Urethane levels can increase in some 
products, especially wines, during shipping, storage and handling. Some 
processing can raise urethane levels. Using urea to stimulate fermentation in 
wine production has been abandoned for that reason. 
</P>
<P>
Concern first surfaced late in 1985 when Canadian authorities found the 
chemical in certain wines and distilled spirits. At that time the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), 
which share responsibility for regulating alcohol, began to seek ways to reduce 
or eliminate the compound from alcoholic beverages. Because as many as 400,000 
different labels of alcoholic beverages may be on the market, sampling to 
assess urethane levels is a formidable task. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence suggests that bourbons -- because of the type of distilling process 
required -- generally contain the highest levels, while vodka and gin have 
negligible amounts. Levels in plum and cherry brandy have varied from 200 to 
12,000 parts per billion (ppb); in dessert wine from less than four to several 
hundred ppb, and in table wine from zero to 25 ppb. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers are experimenting with alternating production methods that will 
reduce urethane levels in finished products. And they have set time goals for 
reducing urethane content. Both the FDA and ATF are working with foreign 
countries to lower the urethane levels in imported beverages. 
</P>
<P>
But while this burst of effort is under way, we have yet to quantify the risk 
to humans. In 1988, the National Toxicology Program agreed to give the problem 
of urethane its highest priority, to better define potential hazards. 
</P>
<P>
Q: One of the things I love is mincemeat pie, but I don't know anything about 
its nutritional value. I always eat it at other people's houses and don't make 
it myself, so I don't even know what's in it. For example, does mincemeat pie 
contain meat? 
</P>
<P>
A: According to John F. Mariani's "Dictionary of American Food and Drink" 
(Ticknor and Fields: 1983), mincemeat typically contains chopped fruits, suet, 
spices and sometimes meat, usually baked in a pie crust. The name is derived 
from the word meaning "to chop finely," says Mariani, which in turn comes from 
the Latin minuere, meaning "to diminish." Dating from the 16th Century, the 
word connoted a pie of fruit, spices and suet, only occasionally containing any 
meat at all. In Colonial America, these pies were often made during the fall 
and preserved to be eaten during the long winters. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, mincemeat made both with and without some type of meat is available 
in the supermarket. But the amount of meat (which appears in the ingredients 
list after salt) is too small to make a difference nutritionally. One-third of 
a cup of mincemeat provides about 200 calories, 96% of them from the 
carbohydrate in both the fruit and sugar used to prepare it.

THE KITCHEN CABINET: SET THE MOOD WHEN YOU SET THE TABLE WITH THESE CLEVER 
ACCESSORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MINNIE BERNARDINO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The style of dinnerware and table-top accessories can evoke a mood for any 
dining or entertaining experience. And in recent years, we've seen fine china 
that's definitely far from boring and ordinary. Instead, these exciting new 
table pieces are making a fashion statement, complementing not only interior 
design schemes in the home but the predominate colors of the season. 
</P>
<P>
In creating these novel patterns, the name of the game is mixing and matching. 
Former top furniture designer and cook book art director Bill Goldsmith owes a 
great part of the success of his porcelain china pattern to this mix and match 
concept. Site de Corot pattern designs (from $170 for a five-piece place 
setting) are very versatile, reminiscent of the layering technique in clothing. 
Goldsmith, who also is the first American design director of a French Limoges 
factory, calls it "modern traditional." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Design for the Present' 
</P>
<P>
"I have eclectic taste. I design for the present -- not classic, not 
avant-garde -- and I don't believe in trends," said the Texas-born artist, who 
was dressed in casual jeans and a sweater during the unveiling of his latest 
china pattern at the recent L.A. Gift Show. 
</P>
<P>
"My patterns range from the very stark in graphics to the very traditional and 
melt in the middle when mixed and matched. I want people to mix (my china) with 
whatever they own; they can mix it with antique or with modern furnishings." 
</P>
<P>
He also would like people to discover that it's more appealing to use different 
pieces at each course during dinner. By orchestrating the movement, each 
setting creates a change of scene and adds variety. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Old-Fashioned to Contemporary 
</P>
<P>
The Site de Corot collection sets range from old-fashioned, large floral 
patterns with magnificent detailing and coloring (called Victoria, Narcissus, 
Alice and Potpourri) to fruit designs (the Berries, Compote, Citron, Poire, 
Fraise) to the simple band-edged (Faux Bois) that blends well with the more 
intricate fruit or floral plate. Echoing contemporary tones are the boldly 
tinted, zig-zagged rimmed pattern called Florida. 
</P>
<P>
In the few years since Site de Corot has been introduced, it has already 
developed a tremendous following, including both home and institutional buyers. 
Pieces have been used by food and bridal magazines; you may have spotted them 
in a mashed potato commercial print ad or in the movie "Wall Street." Goldsmith 
expects to have similar success with his newest pattern, Tulipa, an open tulip 
design that consists of stems, leaves and tulip blooms that are gracefully 
drawn on the white plate, cup or teapot. Like the other motifs, each size of 
the varied-colored china features a different pattern. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Exotic Ensemble 
</P>
<P>
Another porcelain fine china pattern that's getting a lot of attention is Legno 
from Taitu ($102 for a five-piece place setting). Created by Italian designer 
Emilio Bergamin, this exotic dinnerware ensemble explores the feelings of wood, 
its lines and earthy hues. Legno, which means wood in Italian, combines the 
warm tones of blonde wood, black and beige in a geometric play of parquetry and 
inlay. The largest plate has a large open tulip, reflecting a textural fabric 
print. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the casual rhythm of Goldsmith's design, Bergamin extends in 
Legno the symmetry and balance typical of his past creations. What's unusual is 
that sales of his earth-tone color deviations have, surprisingly, taken off in 
a time when jewel tones seem to be the word. 
</P>
<P>
Combine the rustic look of stoneware and the sophisticated glazed porcelain and 
you have Terrafirma. Catering to followers of early 20th-Century craftsmanship, 
Terrafirma Ceramics is one of the few remaining American pottery studios 
producing totally handmade ceramics in that time-honored tradition. Designed by 
Ellen Evans (who founded the firm in New York in 1974), Terrafirma products are 
made of high-fired stoneware, most with overlays of porcelains and some of 
woven stoneware. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Array of Accessories 
</P>
<P>
Gracefully styled with terra-cotta leaves, ribbons, shells, grapes and 
asparagus, the pieces have glazed inner surfaces in beautiful colors of 
turquoise, forest, cobalt, celadon, pink, bisque, ivory, black, slate, opal and 
raspberry. Some are available in moire or marbleized patterns that come in 
malachite, sandstone or ivory, cobalt and smoke (slate). 
</P>
<P>
Oven-proof, dishwasher-safe and microwave-safe, the Terrafirma collection 
consists of an array of serving ware and accessories: rectangular and square 
hors d'oeuvre, pastry and vegetable trays, round cake plates, oval platters, 
leaf platters, soup and salad bowls, shell-shaped bowls, pitchers, vases, 
cachepots and coolers, candlesticks. Recently introduced are the refreshingly 
crafted Calla Lilly and Water Lilly designs.

 The Bill Goldsmith Design Site de Corot China collection is available at Lynne 
Deutch, Geary's, the Cabbage Rose Patch and Fred Segal's Zero Minus Plus.

HEARING ON REFUSE TRANSFER SITE PUT OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Commerce Planning Commission has postponed its decision on an environmental 
impact report on a proposed refuse transfer station in the west end of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing was continued until March 22 after a representative of 
Assemblywoman Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles) said the legislator and 
community members need more time to review the environmental impact report on 
the proposed project. 
</P>
<P>
Laidlaw Waste Systems Inc. is seeking approval to build the plant on the site 
of the former Sinclair Paint factory in the 3900 block of Washington Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
As proposed, small collection trucks operating outside Commerce would deliver 
refuse to the station. The trash would then be loaded onto larger trucks and 
hauled to the Chiquita Canyon landfill in northern Los Angeles County. The 
environmental impact report said the project would have relatively little 
impact on noise, air pollution and traffic congestion in the area.

TEACHERS HOLD FIRST SESSION WITH MEDIATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Teachers in the Paramount Unified School District are still without a contract 
after a negotiating session and a demonstration outside district headquarters 
by about 200 teachers who gathered after school Tuesday and stayed through a 
board meeting that night. 
</P>
<P>
The approximately 525 teachers in the district have been without a contract 
since Aug. 31 when their 3-year agreement expired. Negotiations reached an 
impasse in January and a state mediator was called in to help. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday was the first negotiating session with the mediator but the meeting 
ended without any progress, said John Burritt, executive director of the 
Teachers Assn. of Paramount. Burritt said the board is "stalling" and that the 
tactic "is bordering on bad faith bargaining." 
</P>
<P>
Classroom size, not wages, Burritt said, is the issue causing the impasse. 
Teachers, he said, want the district to phase in a plan that would eventually 
reduce classroom size to about 25 students.

HOME CLUB STORE TO GO ON NORWALK BLVD. SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hawaiian Gardens will get a Home Club store that is expected to bring with it 
as many as 190 jobs and $300,000 a year in sales tax revenue under a 
development agreement approved Tuesday by the City Council, which also serves 
as the city's Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The store, the 42nd in the nation for the Home Club chain, will be located on 
Norwalk Boulevard just south of Carson Street. Under the development and 
disposition agreement that the council approved, Gordon F. Sadkin, a commercial 
real estate developer from Torrance, is buying the land from the city and will 
lease it to Home Club. 
</P>
<P>
David Meyer, the city's redevelopment consultant, said it cost the city 
$4,089,359 to acquire the land and do preparation work such as demolishing old 
buildings and removing hazardous diesel fuel. The city is selling the land to 
Sadkin for $2,776,300 but will recoup the difference of $1,313,059 over the 
next 15 years through property taxes that Sadkin pays, Meyer said.

MANAGER TO RETIRE AFTER 30 YEARS WITH CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Downey City Manager Don Davis, 52, announced his retirement at Tuesday's City 
Council meeting. It will be effective Aug. 21. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' voice broke with emotion as he read a letter stating that his four-year 
commitment to the City Council "will soon run its course." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want anyone to misinterpret (my emotions)," Davis said. "This is 
something I want to do, but when you devote 31 years to an organization, any 
decision (to leave) will be an emotional one." He said he thought his tenure 
"provided stability and continuity to the position when it was really needed." 
</P>
<P>
His career with the city began when he was hired as a firefighter. He rose 
through the ranks to become fire chief in 1978, and continued in that position 
until his 1985 appointment as interim city manager and later city manager. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Randall Barb said that Davis accepted the position as city manager 
"because he loved this community. I just want to tell him I appreciate him a 
lot." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said the announcement was made now to allow the council ample time to 
find a replacement. He said he has no specific plans as to what he will do 
after retirement. 
</P>
<P>
He admits that his retirement does not rule out taking another position in the 
public or private sector. If the offer is interesting and challenging, "I'll 
consider it," he said.

CONFIDENT PLAYER FACES 'BIG VOID' WITHOUT BASKETBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In elementary school, Kathy Goggin was so tall she played on boys' basketball 
teams and towered over her male counterparts. She entered the seventh grade as 
a precocious redhead at 5-foot-9 and by the time she got to Long Beach Wilson 
High School she was "not huge, just a thick" 6-foot-2. 
</P>
<P>
Goggin, now 6-foot-3, lumbered onto the basketball court at Cal State Dominguez 
Hills for the last time Saturday night, the fourth-ranked rebounder and 
ninth-highest scorer in the university's history. She is one of the few 
student-athletes to complete four years of basketball at Dominguez Hills, and 
university officials point proudly to the fact that she is their first Rhodes 
Scholarship candidate. In the fall she will enroll in a doctoral program at 
USC. 
</P>
<P>
But now she faces life without basketball, a scary part of the game that all 
athletes reach sooner or later. 
</P>
<P>
"The big void," is what Dominguez Hills Coach Van Girard called it. 
</P>
<P>
It is a time when the future seems a bit frightening to a 22-year-old senior 
who admits to being "a big baby" when it comes to everyday things. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Led a Sheltered Life' 
</P>
<P>
"I have led a sheltered life." she said. She lives with her parents in east 
Long Beach. Her father is a high school teacher in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Basketball is a great equalizer that teaches young people to overcome 
obstacles, according to Girard. In Goggin's case, her love for basketball grew 
despite discomfort in both knees, a dislocated shoulder, surgery to correct 
tumors on toes and bone spurs in both feet. She overcame those obstacles, so 
Girard suggests she will adjust to "the real world." 
</P>
<P>
"She already has the knowledge and ability to be successful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not that life without basketball won't mean a little adjustment on Goggin's 
part. Early on she discovered that playing a sport was an easy way for a plump 
and gangly freckle-faced youth to win a little respect in a society that often 
pokes fun at physical abnormalities. 
</P>
<P>
"By high school it was no easy picture for me," she said of her increasing 
height, which often drew rude comments. "Going through that made me stronger. I 
believe I can handle just about anything now." 
</P>
<P>
Girard agreed: "What Kathy will find is that there will come a transfer of 
commitment from what she has done on the floor and what she will have to do in 
the real world." 
</P>
<P>
By her own admission, Goggin has had an average career, playing on a series of 
teams from high school to college that had difficulties just finishing .500. 
This season Goggin had a disappointing time. She averaged only 8.6 points and 
5.6 rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't had the productive year I would have liked," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Girard, a successful high school coach who just completed his first-year at 
Dominguez Hills, believes Goggin did not get proper training during her college 
career. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had had her for four years, I feel her statistics would have been much 
more impressive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Goggin, however, is not so sure. "I am not a phenomenal player," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Phenomenal in Classroom 
</P>
<P>
She has been phenomenal in the classroom, however. At Wilson High she received 
just one grade below a straight-A average. It was a borderline B that came as a 
sophomore in a beginning Spanish class. At Cal State Dominguez Hills she has 
faired almost as well, posting a cumulative 3.895 GPA. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not brilliant," she said. "I just work hard." 
</P>
<P>
Goggin received quite a bit of attention in high school, ironically, she says, 
because of her height. Her college choices, oddly enough, boiled down to UCLA 
or Dominguez Hills. UCLA was not interested in her as a basketball player so 
she chose Dominguez Hills because "I wanted to play" more than for its 
academics. 
</P>
<P>
Four years later she has become one of the university's brightest spokespersons 
and its most vocal critic. Because the enrollment is small for a state college, 
she said, class sizes allow for a more personal relationship between 
instructors and students. 
</P>
<P>
Goggin picked at a blueberry muffin during breakfast the other day at a Long 
Beach restaurant. Weight, like height, has been a constant in her life. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just the Goodyear blimp in hiding," she joked. 
</P>
<P>
She was contemplating the answers to questions about her life after basketball. 
Among her worries, she said, would be the little things in life. 
</P>
<P>
"This may sound stupid," she said. "But I haven't paid a rent in my life. How 
do you get a telephone anyway? I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
The tone of the conversation sounded serious enough, but somehow it was hard to 
believe that Goggin would have any trouble surviving--with or without 
basketball--when she faces her real world.

ON VERGE OF A TITLE; 
</P>
<P>
18TH SEASON COULD BE ULTIMATE ONE FOR COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A pillar of stability in the often unstable environment of coaching, Bill Odell 
will soon complete his 18th season at Millikan High School in Long Beach. It 
will be the ultimate one if his team defeats Saddleback High in the CIF 
Southern Section 5-AA championship game Saturday night at the Los Angeles 
Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Odell has taken Millikan to the brink of a CIF title twice before -- the Rams 
lost to Verbum Dei in the finals in 1974 and to Mater Dei two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
He was besieged Monday. His phone seemed to be always ringing. A fair number of 
well-wishers called, along with newspaper reporters and a cable TV network 
requesting interviews. 
</P>
<P>
There was videotape of Saddleback to analyze, strategy to devise, practices to 
plan, parking arrangements to make, tickets to allocate. 
</P>
<P>
And his little office was busy with the coming and going of players, eager to 
view the videotape of their 83-80 victory over St. Monica in the semifinals 
last Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
As is his manner, Odell took it all in stride, with no trace of irritability. 
</P>
<P>
The rigors of coaching have in fact failed to leave any signs of fatigue or 
stress on Odell, who, although approaching 47, has retained a trim, youthful, 
dark-haired appearance. 
</P>
<P>
The victories have accumulated as steadily as the seasons -- Odell's overall 
record is 304-162. This season, in which success occurred rather unexpectedly 
because there were only two returning lettermen, the team is 23-6. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Has Adjusted to Change 
</P>
<P>
The nature of Odell's teams has changed over the years, but he has been able to 
adjust. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been able to change, but without compromising some of the things I feel 
are important, such as character and discipline," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He won with a mostly white team in the early 1970s and wins today with a 
predominantly black team; most of the players are bused to the east-side school 
from areas near downtown Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We've changed ethnically so much in 18 years," Odell said of Millikan. 
</P>
<P>
But he does not see that as the reason the skill level of his players is much 
higher now. It is because "all kids have more exposure to (basketball). We were 
almost confined in the early '70s to a fundamental way of doing things. By the 
end of the '70s we were doing more exciting things, not just because of the 
black kids but because basketball has changed." 
</P>
<P>
He is not surprised that he has stayed so long at Millikan. "I'm fairly 
stable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's his stability," agrees Lakewood High Coach Tim Sweeney, "that makes him 
and his program successful." 
</P>
<P>
Long enamored of the school and its administrators, Odell said there is no 
reason to leave: "It is a home for me. Very special." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Feelings of Satisfaction 
</P>
<P>
The real souvenirs of his past are not trophies but feelings of satisfaction 
that have come from watching youngsters progress and develop and "knowing 
you're helping people . . . that's what keeps me here." 
</P>
<P>
Also, he has stayed because of a desire to keep his wife and children secure. 
"My family is so important to me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His son, David, is a former Ram guard who now plays as a senior for Westmont 
College in Santa Barbara. His daughter, Susie, is a volleyball star at 
Westmont. It is the alma mater of their father, an all-city player at 
Huntington Park High who chose Westmont because it is a Christian school. 
</P>
<P>
Odell's reputation extends far beyond merely being a sound basketball 
technician. 
</P>
<P>
"He demonstrates a high degree of concern for his players, not just on an 
athletic level but on a personal level," said Bob Swanson, who played for Odell 
in 1980. Swanson is minister to collegians at the First Baptist Church of 
Lakewood, of which Odell has long been a member. 
</P>
<P>
Odell's former players tend to remain loyal to him. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Marty, an All-CIF player at Millikan in 1978, helps Odell as a part-time 
assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Great coaches can get the most out of their teams," Marty said. "Great 
teachers can inspire players to be good citizens. He does both. He wants to 
teach basketball and instill good values." 
</P>
<P>
A study in moderation, Odell is devoid of the irate outbursts common in many 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"He raises his voice sometimes, but is under control," Marty said. "Some 
coaches turn into crazed animals on the court; he's on an even keel. But in the 
gym he is very much the competitor." 
</P>
<P>
Terry Hilliard, who leads the Rams with an average of 14.6 points a game, said 
Odell yells at the players only if they make mental errors. "It's just to get 
us pumped up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Odell recalls occasionally "displaying anger" to players or officials, but does 
not remember losing his temper. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that it's just a high school basketball game," he said. 
"Win or lose, you're still teaching and getting across what you believe in. You 
like to win, but education goes on whether you're winning or losing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
He Instills Pride 
</P>
<P>
What he tries to instill is pride. 
</P>
<P>
"Pride in who they are and what they do," Odell said. "That carries over to 
practice and games, and to the rest of their lives." 
</P>
<P>
And pride in how they present themselves. 
</P>
<P>
He addressed the team briefly Monday afternoon about the logistics for Saturday 
night: "The bus leaves at 5. We need to dress nicely. I'm not talking about 
your best sweat suit or Levis outfit . . . churchgoing clothes." 
</P>
<P>
This directive drew no complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Odell said the biggest change he has detected in players over the years is that 
their egos have expanded. 
</P>
<P>
"The I part has become greater," he said. "On the court it has become, 'I'm 
going to outdo you." You spend more time getting back to a team concept. It's 
the biggest battle we have now." 
</P>
<P>
Odell has won that battle this season. "Early on we were selfish," he said. "As 
we were able to put away our selfishness, we became a better team." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Positive Attitude 
</P>
<P>
Jeep Jensen, who is second on the team in scoring with a 13.5-point average and 
first in rebounds with an average of eight a game, said Odell has given the 
team a positive attitude through his emphasis on working together. "We get 
excited when we see our other players do well," Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
And now Odell awaits the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be nice to win, but the world will not be over if we don't," he said. 
"People say this has to be the least talented team I've taken to the finals . . 
. but I'd have to think about that. I feel real good about taking this group 
anywhere. It's a together team that's willing to pay the price." 
</P>
<P>
Soon, he will come upon that bittersweet time when faces that have become so 
familiar in the last three years will disappear. "It's not sad," the coach 
insisted. "You have to prepare them to go out, to go on to bigger things. I 
love to have them come back to talk, but they have to have the ability to let 
go. 
</P>
<P>
"The last three weeks I've gone over next year's roster six times . . . who's 
going to improve, who's going to grow." 
</P>
<P>
He is happy that after all these seasons, the excitement of yet another one, 
with new people to help, is still there.

THE BASKETBALL SEASON IN REVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
A LOOK BACK AT THE LIGHTER MOMENTS AND COURT JESTERS THAT MADE THE SPORT 
AMUSING

<P>
Basketballs weren't the only things bounced in Glendale-area gyms this winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Occidental College forward John Keister offered his version of the human 
dribble while Eagle Rock High's Michael Epps bounced a couple of scoring 
records from the all-time Eagle books. 
</P>
<P>
 The determination of St. Francis guard Tom Parada barely fit inside his 
5-foot-2 body. And Glendale College's bespectacled Bruce Heicke played like an 
extra from "Hoosiers" despite looking like an extra from "Revenge of the 
Nerds." 
</P>
<P>
 Now the notes, quotes and anecdotes from the season. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Valuable Posterior 
</P>
<P>
Occidental College forward John Keister averaged a team-high 22 points a game 
and made a habit of frustrating defenders. 
</P>
<P>
Keister's most dangerous quality? Quick hands? A deadly jump shot? 
</P>
<P>
Nope. 
</P>
<P>
His most valuable asset was, well, his keester. 
</P>
<P>
Whether he was fouled or not, Keister would punctuate most shots by skittering 
across the floor on his derriere. 
</P>
<P>
The flop would draw whistles from referees and frowns from opposing coaches, 
many of whom thought the Tiger should be spanked with a technical foul for 
excessive use of his tail. 
</P>
<P>
"If you fall right on your butt bone, it hurts," Keister said. "But if you fall 
on your cheeks, you're fine. This year I've got it down." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
And What Do We Get If We Finish Last? 
</P>
<P>
Hoover High Coach Kirt Kohlmeier promised his team a pizza dinner if it held a 
team to less than 45 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Tornadoes, who finished 7-16, did just that against Arcadia, holding the 
Apaches to 43. There was a problem, however: Hoover scored just 41. 
</P>
<P>
Kohlmeier still popped for the pizza. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Next, I'm Gonna Jam in Your Face, Beanpole 
</P>
<P>
At 5-foot-2, St. Francis High guard Tom Parada was the shortest player in the 
Del Rey League. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, he forgot. 
</P>
<P>
Once, after a defensive switch, Parada wound up guarding 6-10 Loyola center 
Ryan Jamison, the tallest player in league. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody in the stands was laughing," Parada said. "He was laughing, too. If 
he would have put it on the ground, I would have ripped him." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Parada lined up along the key next to Jamison on a free-throw attempt. 
"I looked up at him and said, 'My board,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Jamison's 20-inch height advantage won out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Luckily, Their Car Had a Big Wheel 
</P>
<P>
While driving to a game at Redlands, a group of Occidental College players were 
thrust into darkness in the middle of a fast break far more imposing than any 
they had encountered on the court. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Caba was driving, Keith Berglund was in the passenger seat and Brett Dennis 
was sleeping in the back of the car. When Caba reached to adjust the radio, he 
realized that the car's electrical system had failed. The headlights and 
dashboard lights were off. He was, in effect, at the helm of a Celica Stealth 
Bomber, cruising down the fast lane of the San Bernardino Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"We almost got reamed from behind," Berglund said. 
</P>
<P>
Caba guided his car across traffic to the right shoulder, narrowly missing 
several cars before smacking into a 6-inch-high curb, jarring Dennis from his 
slumber. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the group made its way to a gas station where they called ahead to 
Redlands and asked Occidental Coach Brian Newhall's wife to pick them up. 
</P>
<P>
Berglund said that it would have been much tougher to convince a rescue party 
to come if Dennis, a starter, was not along. 
</P>
<P>
"If we didn't have him," Berglund said, "we would have been eating dinner at 
the AM/PM." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Matijasevic Becomes a Hoop-Seeking Missile 
</P>
<P>
Before Crescenta Valley High forward Paul Matijasevic took up basketball, he 
would spend his afternoons cruising around La Crescenta on his skateboard. 
</P>
<P>
Matijasevic's favorite game was to lie supine on his board and barrel down a 
steep street in a position aptly dubbed "the coffin." Two years ago, he says, a 
friend followed him in a car and proudly informed the 6-foot-5 missile that he 
was traveling at 50 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
If he could only get up and down the court that quickly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Just a Little Spit and Polish, Brian 
</P>
<P>
Glendale College Coach Brian Beauchemin did have something red at his feet when 
the Vaqueros played Mt. San Jacinto, but it wasn't a red carpet. 
</P>
<P>
While tangling with Glendale's Dave Swanson, Eagle forward Otis Mixon was 
elbowed in the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
And although he did not bleed profusely, Mixon was intent on showing Beauchemin 
the extent of the injury. He walked by the Glendale bench where Beauchemin was 
sitting, bent over and spat in front of the coach. 
</P>
<P>
Beauchemin remained silent. 
</P>
<P>
Later, after Mixon had collected his fifth foul, he repeated the act. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Beauchemin calmly informed the referee that he "didn't appreciate 
the spitting." 
</P>
<P>
"Mt. San Jacinto kids have always been bad actors," Beauchemin said. "He had to 
do what he had to do, but I didn't need the shoe shine." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How Not to Improve International Relations 
</P>
<P>
The Occidental College women's team traveled to Nassau for the Bahamas Goombay 
Shootout but found the facilities to be pretty rudimentary. 
</P>
<P>
The team practiced on a dilapidated asphalt court outside the gym in which 
tournament games were played. Each practice drew a large audience of locals, 
many of whom toted reggae-blasting radios. But Coach Sue Semrau said that the 
onlookers were not there to check out the talent or gawk at Occidental players. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they were just mad because we took their court," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
And Beating You Badly by Our Calculation 
</P>
<P>
Because he sustained an eye injury in a pick-up game last summer, Glendale 
College guard Bruce Heicke wears goggles while he plays. The specs make him 
look more like a slide-rule salesman than a scoring threat -- giving Heicke an 
advantage over unwitting opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"They think I stink and they don't know I'm pretty good," said Heicke, who 
averaged 14.9 points a game. "They say, 'Hey, this white guy with goggles is 
beating me. This isn't happening. This guy's wearing goggles, his hair's messed 
up, he's crazy." 
</P>
<P>
His long set shots especially didn't set well with defenders. 
</P>
<P>
Once, an Antelope Valley player was particularly irked and sought crude revenge 
after Heicke had humiliated him. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me to shut up," Heicke said. "I looked at him and he said, 'Yeah you, 
four-eyes.' Then he spit on me.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hey, Spielberg. . . What If I Had Made It? 
</P>
<P>
St. Francis High forward Dominic Mumulo missed a layup with five seconds to 
play, costing the Golden Knights a first-round playoff game against La Canada. 
St. Francis lost, 64-63. 
</P>
<P>
Mumulo's father was videotaping the game but did not capture the ill-fated try 
because the crowd was standing. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the moment wasn't saved for posterity was no reprieve for the 
younger Mumulo, however. 
</P>
<P>
"I really wanted to see it," he said. "I wanted to see how we unfolded." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Timeout Advice: Hold On to the Ball 
</P>
<P>
In its season finale against Pomona, the Occidental College team fell victim to 
a new NCAA rule which stipulates that a warning buzzer, and not a referee, 
summon a team from its huddle with 15 seconds left in a one-minute time- 
</P>
<P>
out. At the one-minute mark, a final buzzer sounds. 
</P>
<P>
With 1:20 to play and the score tied, 70-70, Pomona called a timeout and the 
Occidental cheerleaders took the court. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental assistant Jim Kerman, who usually breaks the huddle at the first 
buzzer, was embroiled in a discussion with another assistant and missed the 
warning. 
</P>
<P>
"We were yick-yacking back and forth," Kerman said. "And the cheerleaders began 
this especially loud cheer where they will chant something and get a response 
from the crowd." 
</P>
<P>
The second buzzer sounded, and, before any Tiger took the court, a Pomona 
player scored an uncontested layup. 
</P>
<P>
"We were freaked," Occidental forward John Keister said. "Someone said, 'Hurry 
up! They're getting ready to throw the ball in!' Just when I was getting up off 
the bench I saw them get the layup." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Dream Season 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of whether his team was winning or losing, Crescenta Valley Coach 
John Goffredo had problems with insomnia during the season. On a good night, he 
would make it to 4 a.m. before he got out of bed in frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough to unwind," Goffredo said in January. "You don't want to give in. 
You try to sleep but you just can't." 
</P>
<P>
There is some relief, Goffredo said: "They've got good movies on in the middle 
of the night and the newspaper comes around 4." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Jam Session of a Different Sort 
</P>
<P>
La Canada High center Chad Givens, last year's Rio Hondo League MVP, dominated 
many players his size and averaged 19 points and nine rebounds a game this 
season. Givens has the toughest time dominating a considerably shorter opponent 
-- his cello. 
</P>
<P>
"I dwarf the thing," said Givens, who played in a string quartet last summer. 
"There aren't that many 6-7 cellists out there." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gumbys' Rule No. 1: No Sitting on the Bench 
</P>
<P>
Riding the bench is seldom glamorous but a group of Occidental College players 
made the most of their reserve roles, forming an elite fraternity: the Gumbys. 
</P>
<P>
"We're called the Gumbys because we're the biggest stiffs around," Tony Berlin 
said. So stiff, in fact, that they rarely sat. 
</P>
<P>
Before one game, the group vowed to remain standing until the Tigers built a 
10-point lead. To everyone's relief, Occidental opened with a 10-0 run. Keith 
Berglund said the group was constantly being reprimanded by agitated referees. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll come by and say, 'Sit down, guys,' And we'll sit down and bounce up 
two seconds later," he said. "It's like the NFL spike rule: It has to be 
spontaneous standing." 
</P>
<P>
When he watches games on television, Berglund pays close attention to the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to pick up pointers," he said. "For instance, they have certain 
handshakes for certain things."

INGLEWOOD OKS PLANS FOR PSYCHIATRIC CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a defeat for one of Inglewood's largest employers and most powerful 
institutions, the City Council unanimously approved a 14-bed psychiatric 
treatment facility opposed by Centinela Hospital Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials, who said they fear residents of the facility would endanger 
their patients and employees, said they will challenge the decision in court 
unless their dispute with the operators of the facility can be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meet With Councilmen 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the hospital and the Didi Hirsch Community Mental Health 
Center, which wants to build the facility across the street from the hospital, 
said they will meet with Inglewood Councilmen Anthony Scardenzan and Daniel 
Tabor next week. 
</P>
<P>
The vote came after several months of angry words and energetic lobbying by 
both sides. 
</P>
<P>
The debate evoked the larger mental health crisis in Los Angeles County, and 
included references to last week's fatal stabbing by a mental patient of a 
Santa Monica mental health worker. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rekindled Tensions 
</P>
<P>
The debate has also rekindled tensions between Centinela and city officials, 
some of whom privately accuse the medical center of throwing its considerable 
weight around in an effort to run the city. 
</P>
<P>
They and Hirsch supporters said the hospital was fomenting unreasonable fear of 
the mentally ill. They charge the hospital wants to acquire the site, which the 
hospital disputes. 
</P>
<P>
Centinela officials say the hospital has taken justifiable interest in 
important issues over the years. And they said the City Council's vote in favor 
of the Didi Hirsch organization Tuesday was a serious mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision made by the City Council shows ineffectiveness on the part of 
representatives elected to protect their constituents . . . ," said Centinela 
Vice President Eric Tuckman in a prepared statement. "We would be abrogating 
our responsibility if we allowed an unlocked crisis treatment center for the 
most severely and critically mentally ill to be located directly across the 
street from our emergency room and child care center." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ellen Brand, executive director of the Didi Hirsch center, was full of 
praise for the council members, some of whom acknowledge that their vote might 
push the hospital to oppose them at the ballot box. In the past, political 
action committees affiliated with the hospital have contributed heavily to 
political candidates and to campaigns on local ballot measures. 
</P>
<P>
"Here is a small municipal body that took a courageous stand in the face of 
incredible odds," Brand said. "Hopefully it sends a signal to those who would 
ignore the need for these services." 
</P>
<P>
Council members said they agonized over their votes. But they said state law 
and city zoning made it clear that Didi Hirsch had the right to build the 
center on the site. The facility is intended to provide treatment for selected 
mental patients released from hospital care. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Planning Commission granted the clinic a special-use permit in 
December, which Centinela appealed to the council. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Voted My Conscience' 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good that I voted my conscience," Councilman Tabor said Wednesday. Like 
other council members, he cited state law that prohibits discrimination against 
the mentally ill in the approval of health-care facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Scardenzan said he hopes Centinela and Hirsch can reach an 
agreement, and expressed resentment at being caught "between a rock and a hard 
place" in the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Centinela officials will bring suggestions for alternative sites to next week's 
meeting with Scardenzan and Tabor, hospital spokesman Julius Mason said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Brand said the Hirsch organization would consider the possibility of 
another location, but said it would be difficult to find another properly 
zoned, reasonably priced site. She said the mental health center must proceed 
quickly with the planned facility or risk losing $500,000 in county mental 
health funds. 
</P>
<P>
As for possible political fallout from the decision, Centinela government 
relations director Leona Eglund said before Tuesday's vote that the hospital 
had withheld all endorsements in the city's April elections. 
</P>
<P>
Tabor and Scardenzan are up for reelection, and a vacant council seat will also 
be contested April 4. 
</P>
<P>
Eglund made no threats, saying merely that the hospital had decided to withhold 
support of any candidates until the mental health center issue was resolved.

CHLORINE LEAK'S IMPACT; 
</P>
<P>
SIMI HIRES FIRM TO STUDY TOXIC MATERIALS PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Simi Valley officials have hired a consultant to help prepare a plan to handle 
storage and disposal of hazardous materials nearly two months after a chlorine 
gas leak forced the evacuation of 12,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council's hiring Monday of a Ventura firm for $50,000 stems from a 
months-old effort to improve the city's management of toxic materials, city 
officials said. The Jan. 5 chlorine leak made that effort more urgent, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The chlorine incident reinforced a feeling in the community and on the council 
that many of these chemicals that we are dealing with . . . have got to be 
handled a lot better than maybe they have been," Mayor Gregory Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
The city Department of Public Works on Monday presented to the council an 
83-page report outlining 11 recommendations on how the city could keep a closer 
eye on toxic materials and businesses that use them. The recommendations 
included on-site inspections, planning and zoning laws to control where toxics 
are stored or disposed of, and a household hazardous waste collection program. 
</P>
<P>
The council hired the firm of Kennedy/Jenks/Chilton to analyze the report and 
return in four to six months, possibly with additional measures. The study will 
mainly focus on how the city can better coordinate its efforts with county, 
state and federal agencies that also regulate toxic materials, Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are about 15 different agencies that have their finger in it one way or 
another," Stratton said. "What we're trying to do is become sort of an umbrella 
organization . . . to make sure each of them gets what it needs." 
</P>
<P>
For example, the city would make sure that new and existing businesses notify 
other government bodies of all toxic materials storage, transportation or 
disposal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley officials would like the city to assume the lead role in handling 
toxic materials within city boundaries, rather than have an outside regulatory 
agency make the key decisions, said Ronald C. Coons, city director of public 
works. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 5, a poisonous chlorine gas leak from a 30-ton tank at Travelin' West 
Textiles prompted the evacuations. Twenty people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, a Simi Valley report said Simi Valley and Ventura County officials 
reacted well during the 12-hour crisis.

VAN NUYS MAN WHO RESCUED VICTIM OF ATTACK TO GET MEDAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 36-year-old Van Nuys man who risked his life to save another man from being 
stabbed to death was one of 19 people chosen to receive the Andrew Carnegie 
Medal for heroism. 
</P>
<P>
James Edward Fell is being honored for coming to the rescue of Eulalio 
Castellanos, 29, of Los Angeles in a stabbing attack Dec. 15, 1986, said Walter 
Rutkowski, secretary of the Andrew Carnegie Hero Fund Commission of Pittsburgh, 
Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Fell, who witnessed the assault while driving by in his car, came to the aid of 
Castellanos and was stabbed after he struck the assailant, Rutkowski said. Fell 
and Castellanos were hospitalized for their injuries and later recovered, 
Rutkowski said. 
</P>
<P>
Fell was notified about his award Friday in a letter from the Carnegie 
Commission, Rutkowski said. Fell and Castellanos were unavailable for comment 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to a medal and a certificate, each of the 19 award recipients will 
receive a check for $2,500, Rutkowski said. 
</P>
<P>
The award was established by industrial magnet Andrew Carnegie in 1904 and is 
presented to recipients throughout the United States and Canada six times a 
year, Rutkowski said. Since the award's inception, about $17.7 million has been 
given to people who have aided others in life-threatening situations, he said.

WORK ON LONG-AWAITED PARK IN CANYON COUNTRY TO START APRIL 1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After an 11-year wait, work is scheduled to begin April 1 on a $2-million 
public park in Canyon Country, a project hailed by Santa Clarita officials as 
one of the benefits of cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon Country Park had been stalled by red tape and a lack of park funds for 
years while under Los Angeles County jurisdiction, said Councilwoman Jo Anne 
Darcy, also a field deputy to Supervisor Mike Antonovich. The county purchased 
the 20-acre site near Soledad Canyon Road and Sand Canyon Road in 1978, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The way they were going, they never would have built anything," Councilman 
Howard P. (Buck) McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon spoke shortly before the council on Tuesday night awarded a $2-million 
contract to build the park to Valley Crest Landscape, a San Fernando firm. 
</P>
<P>
But Santa Clarita, which is 15 months old and has a smaller bureaucracy than 
the county, was able to push the project through rapidly, said Jeff Kolin, city 
director of parks and recreation. Completion of the park is scheduled by 
December, probably in time for the city's second anniversary Dec. 15, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The city also hired a private firm to design the park rather than use county 
planners, which would have delayed the project several months, Kolin said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the park will be built with grants and developer fees collected by the 
county since 1978, Kolin said. Other grants and fees collected by the city 
since incorporation in December, 1987, will complete the funding package. 
</P>
<P>
Most Santa Clarita city parks are in Newhall and Valencia, so the new park on 
the city's western border will be a welcome addition to Canyon Country, said 
Mayor Jan Heidt, who lives in Canyon Country. The park will include a ball 
field, recreational building and exercise trail.

FAIR TO SEEK PERMIT FOR SITE OPPOSED BY NEARBY CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Renaissance Pleasure Faire officials said Wednesday that they will apply for a 
permit to use a 130-acre site in Ventura County despite opposition from nearby 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
Fair spokesman Eric Stoltz reiterated the spring festival's commitment to 
securing the proposed site after learning that the Thousand Oaks City Council 
had decided Tuesday night to send the county a letter opposing the event -- 
which has drawn more than 300,000 people during a six-week run. 
</P>
<P>
Later Wednesday, the Moorpark City Council voted to draft a letter opposing the 
fair and to send it to the county. But if the county approves use of the site 
over the city's objections, Moorpark council members said they will ask that an 
environmental impact report be required. 
</P>
<P>
In its letter, the Thousand Oaks City Council said it supported preserving as 
open space and for agricultural uses the Tierra Rejada Valley, an 
unincorporated area of eastern Ventura County where the proposed site is 
located. 
</P>
<P>
The letter said the council opposes "any intensive land use for any commercial 
purpose" in the Tierra Rejada Valley, including the fair. It dated its 
opposition to development of the valley to 1982, when it joined Simi Valley and 
the county in designating the area as a greenbelt. Moorpark joined the 
agreement in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Stoltz said the fair is not a commercial event because it benefits the Living 
History Centre, a nonprofit organization. 
</P>
<P>
But Thousand Oaks City Councilman Alex Fiore said the fair is a commercial 
event because about 175 vendors rent booths and sell goods. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition to the fair has surfaced since fair officials announced in January 
that they had rented the proposed site, which is about a quarter of a mile west 
of the Moorpark Freeway. It is bordered by Tierra Rejada Road on the north, 
Moorpark Road on the south and east, and by hills on the west. 
</P>
<P>
For 25 years, the fair had been held near Agoura Hills, but that site has been 
sold to a developer. 
</P>
<P>
Fair officials said they intend to apply by the end of next week for a permit 
to use the Tierra Rejada site for eight consecutive weekends, beginning May 6. 
</P>
<P>
County planner Paul Porter said that once an application is filed, the county 
will add the letter from Thousand Oaks to its staff report on the project. In 
addition, Thousand Oaks, Moorpark, Simi Valley and Camarillo will have a chance 
to comment on the application.

NORTH HOLLYWOOD MAN HELD IN BAR SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles police arrested a North Hollywood man Wednesday in a Sun Valley bar 
shooting that left one man dead and another injured last month, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Alfred M. Cook, 27, was arrested at 7 a.m. at Saticoy Street and Lankershim 
Boulevard after police followed him from his nearby apartment, Los Angeles 
Police Detective Mike Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
Coffey said Cook is suspected in the Feb. 12 slaying of Agapito B. Cervantes, 
27, of North Hollywood. The shooting occurred during an argument at the Tabu 
Room bar in the 11600 block of Sherman Way. 
</P>
<P>
After shooting Cervantes, police said, Cook also shot Pedro G. Robles, 20, of 
Sun Valley. Robles was only slightly injured. Cervantes died about an hour 
after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Coffey said other patrons of the bar identified Cook as the gunman. He was 
arrested on suspicion of murder.

<P>
The best power window buildings in the San Fernando Valley -- each with a 
unique view and all with sweeping corner offices -- according to 10 commercial 
real estate brokers are: 
</P>
<P>
Trillium buildings in Woodland Hills are two structures with 17 floors each and 
a view that spans the Santa Monica Mountains in Calabasas, Tarzana and Woodland 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Voit building, also in Woodland Hills, has 20 floors and a view of the entire 
West Valley. 
</P>
<P>
16000 Ventura Blvd. building in Encino has 12 floors and provides a view of the 
whole Valley. 
</P>
<P>
American Savings building in Sherman Oaks has 22 floors and a view of the San 
Diego Freeway, the Valley and parts of the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Tower Burbank in Burbank features 32 floors that are just being occupied. From 
the building, considered the tallest in the Glendale-Burbank-Pasadena corridor, 
the Hollywood Hills, Encino and the San Gabriel Mountains are visible. 
</P>
<P>
MCA/Texaco building in Universal City, with 35 floors, is considered by real 
estate agents as California's tallest building between the Santa Monica 
Mountains and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank Center/Disney Channel building in Burbank has 21 floors and a view of 
the San Gabriel Mountains, Hollywood Hills and the valleys between.

'THE PERFECT PARTY' A COMICAL BUT SERIOUS LOOK AT LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just aR. Gurney's semi-autobiographical "The Cocktail Hour" sheds light on the 
life of the writer, "The Perfect Party," now in a staged reading by the San 
Diego Actors Theatre, illuminates how Gurney sees the craft of writing itself. 
</P>
<P>
As with the best of Gurney, the commentary is at once comical and serious, with 
a touch of the surreal thrown in to remind us that the travails of a 
middle-aged professor of literature can say as much about the human condition 
as those of the historically less fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Perfect Party," the professor, Tony (Brian Salmon), has chucked his 
profession to give the perfect party, a practice he hopes to continue full 
time. (The perfect party translates as neatly into the perfect play as George 
Orwell's "Animal Farm" translates into the Russian Revolution.) 
</P>
<P>
In his desperation for success, Tony drives his long-suffering wife (Amelia 
Emerson) batty, bullies and edits the conversations of his best friends Wes and 
Wilma (Richard Harrison and Parker Tenney), telling them not to talk about 
taboo subjects like Israel or their kids, and tries to seduce a New York critic 
(Laura Ganz) by pretending to be his own evil twin brother. 
</P>
<P>
The biting question that charges the jokes is just how far one may tamper with 
art in the search for acceptance, and what the cost of compromise is to the 
work and to oneself. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison, who also directed the show, keeps the humor broad in the spirit of 
parody, while keeping the focus of attack always in sight. Salmon rarely has 
had as forceful a part as Tony; he takes the reins and runs with the horse, 
leaving the others to breathlessly catch up with him. Ganz brings gleaming, 
well-sharpened claws to the part of the critic, Emerson sweet despair to the 
role of the wife and Harrison and Tenney, a pleasing comedy team 
</P>
<P>
banter to the part of the reluctant couple Tony so desperately needs to 
complete his party. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Actors Theatre takes some liberties with the 3-year-old script, 
which first was done at Playwrights Horizons. They've cut it and added a 
topical reference to the "Geraldo" show. It works; one only hopes the 
playwright -- who was not consulted -- doesn't mind. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the production is, as billed, a semi-staged reading rather than a full 
performance. The actors are mostly, but not completely off their scripts. The 
elegant venue of the Picasso room, a last minute gift from the Horton Park 
Plaza Hotel when the company's space at the Progressive Stage Company fell 
through, could hardly be more appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
The dressy costumes similarly hit the mark and there is movement, but minimal 
scenery -- all of which works surprisingly well because of the metaphorical 
rather than realistic nature of the play. 
</P>
<P>
Still, this "Perfect Party" just whets the appetite for a full production. 
</P>
<P>
Performances at 8:30 p.m. March 2 and 8 p.m. March 4-5 at the Horton Park Plaza 
Hotel, 901 5th Ave, San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Creating a classic must be a heady sensation for those in on the creation. But 
those who inevitably try to recreate the magic often find themselves working 
against standards that memory renders increasingly unreachable. 
</P>
<P>
"My Fair Lady," a United States International University (USIU) production of 
the Lerner and Loewe musical now playing at the Theatre in Old Town through 
March 12, does awfully well considering the memories it is up against. There 
are many pleasant moments under Alvin Kaufman's direction and Kerry Duse's 
musical guidance, but don't look for any new riffs. 
</P>
<P>
The part of Henry Higgins -- the condescending grammarian who believes that 
language lessons can transform a flower girl into a lady, was, according to Rex 
Harrison's son, Carey, the most memorable role of that actor's career. Andrew 
Barnicle, a professor at USIU who tackles Higgins, wisely avoids an imitation 
of that classic performance. 
</P>
<P>
Barnicle captures the look-down-the-nose aspect of Higgins' character 
beautifully, but it is hard to go the distance and play crotchety without 
conveying age. When Harrison warned his flower girl that she shouldn't get any 
ideas about him, as he is a confirmed old bachelor, we could believe him. But 
Barnicle is too young and comely to make that line sound anything but coy. 
</P>
<P>
As Liza, Carol Logen, a former USIU graduate actress, does not come into the 
Julie Andrews/Audrey Hepburn role dramatically or musically until the second 
act when she gets to use her strong upper register in the songs. At that point 
she becomes an increasing pleasure to watch. 
</P>
<P>
Among the supporting cast of students at USIU, Thorsten Kieselbach as Liza's 
n'er-do-well father, is outstanding. He provides a wonderfully warped look at 
the world from a self-satisfied sponger's point of view. John Barrowman does a 
winning job with Freddie Einsford-Hill, Liza's romantic, sweet-voiced suitor, 
and Rebecca Navaian Amoli brings authority to the role of Higgins' mother. 
</P>
<P>
The versatile chorus work -- with about 20 students alternating as women of 
London, men of London, maids, servants and cockneys -- is especially admirable. 
</P>
<P>
Like the others, costume designer Bary Odom goes up against his own ghosts -- 
specifically the memory of "My Fair Lady" designer Cecil Beaton. But here there 
are no disappointments. It is a wonder how he stretches a student budget to 
cover all those hats. Ah well, the school must have made up for it in the 
cardboard cut-outs they were reduced to for the scenery. 
</P>
<P>
To see a small company attempt a big show like this is much like watching 
Higgins try to turn a flower girl into a fair lady. This production doesn't 
quite make it as a lady, but it provides many pleasurable moments nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
Performances at 8 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday and 7 p.m. Sundays, with 
Saturday/Sunday matinees at 2 through March 12. At the Theatre in Old Town, 
4040 Twiggs Ave., San Diego.

Ticketmaster chairman Fred Rosen has branded as "outrageous" a Seattle lawsuit 
seeking to return non-refundable service fees from Ticketmaster Corp. to 
holders of tickets to three Michael Jackson concerts that were canceled. 
Service fees ranging from $2.25 to $3.25 per ticket were withheld on the 72,000 
tickets sold. The class-action lawsuit, filed in King County Superior Court, 
asks for return of service fees and seeks an additional $5 for each of the fans 
deprived of seeing the pop superstar in what he said would be his last solo 
tour. The suit could cost the computerized ticket agency an estimated $540,000 
if the ticket buyers prevail at trial. ALEENE MacMINN

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: 'LIGHT' JAZZ HAS FOUND A HEFTY MARKET 
IN S.D. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Exact demographics for the San Diego market may not be their strong point, but 
the people at GRP, perhaps the leading "light" jazz label, know they've got a 
major market here. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego's always been considered a good jazz town because of KIFM and the 
promoters -- the shows they do at places like Humphrey's and the Bacchanal," 
said Mark Wexler, head of marketing for the New York record label that was 
founded by Dave Grusin and Larry Rosen. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Wexler labeled San Diego a small town and pegged the area's 
population at "about 750,000" (it's well over 2 million), he had a better idea 
of just how well his company's records -- by artists such as Lee Ritenour, 
Grusin, Chick Corea, David Benoit and Tom Scott -- are doing. 
</P>
<P>
Wexler couldn't supply figures for San Diego alone, but said sales here account 
for a significant portion of the label's Southern California sales, which 
totaled more than $3 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
Tower Records on Sports Arena Boulevard, the largest record store in the 
county, with sales of $500,000 a month, can attest to GRP's strength here. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very good market," said Danny Birch, assistant manager at the store. 
"There are two radio stations in town that play commercial jazz. You don't find 
that in other cities. They've always done well, even when they were 
independent." 
</P>
<P>
GRP signed a distribution agreement with MCA a couple of years ago that puts 
its albums in nearly every major record store in the country. Birch said a top 
GRP artist such as keyboard man David Benoit might sell 300 to 400 albums at 
the Sports Arena Tower store alone. By comparison, straight jazz artists are 
lucky to sell half-a-dozen copies. 
</P>
<P>
Those who enjoy echoic sax riffs a la David Sanborn or the Chinese water 
torture of drum machines will want to check out saxophonist Gerald Albright's 
8:30 p.m. appearance March 8 at the Bacchanal. 
</P>
<P>
Albright is a versatile talent. Immediately after college, he toured with 
keyboard player Patrice Rushen, first on sax, later on bass. Unfortunately, 
there's only one track from his new self-produced "Bermuda Nights," where his 
playing takes precedence over the electronic Jacuzzi jazz fog. On the 
composition "Too Cool," his smooth, sexy playing, reminiscent of Grover 
Washington Jr.'s, is perfectly set off by the lyrical work of Bobby Lyle on 
acoustic piano. 
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, the album is headed for commercial success, having already sold 
120,000 copies. Albright acknowledges his desire to make music that appeals to 
a wide audience. Pressed, he even admits being a victim of the corporate 
marketing machine at Atlantic Records, his label. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot has to go into the way the record company likes to market me," Albright 
said. "There's a fine line between how they'd like to market me and how I'd 
like to be marketed. My music touches the technical, electronic side, and the 
beat. Record companies subconsciously think you've got to have some kind of 
beat to promote sales. Between those two elements, we arrived at the type of 
music that I'm doing, and I feel real comfortable doing it." 
</P>
<P>
For a more challenging evening, consider hearing free-form reed master Vinny 
Golia on Monday night at Jazz Mine Records and CDs in La Jolla. Golia has 
recorded with New York free jazz tenor sax man Tim Berne and with pianist Wayne 
Peet and bassist Ken Filiano, who will form part of a quintet for the Jazz Mine 
date. His new album, "Worldwide and Portable," is one of about a dozen he's 
made as a leader. 
</P>
<P>
Tierrasanta producer and musician John Archer placed his name among rarefied 
company on Grammy night last week. Archer and Ronn Satterfield are the players 
behind the local band Checkfield. Both are fluent on guitar, piano, vocals and 
synthesizers, and they play a majority of the instruments on Checkfield's new 
11-song album, "Through the Lens." 
</P>
<P>
Some call the music, with its thick, studio-produced textures, "New Age." 
Recorded at Network Productions in Rancho Bernardo, where Archer works as a 
producer, the album is receiving local radio play and selling well in such 
cities as San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, Minneapolis and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Archer's work at the control board that got the Grammy nomination, 
not the music. Along with albums by Doc Severinsen, Stevie Winwood, Glenn Frey, 
Little Feat and Scritti Politti, Checkfield's album was up for best 
engineering. 
</P>
<P>
"We paid very careful attention to the blends between the acoustic and 
synthesized instruments," Archer said, explaining why he thinks the recording 
was a contender. "Most people would be hard-pressed to tell what's acoustic and 
what's synthesized." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Archer's seamless production, the Grammy people gave the engineering 
award to singer Winwood's "Roll With It." 
</P>
<P>
SHORT RIFFS: The last of the Athenaeum's five-part jazz history lecture series 
starts at 7 p.m. Monday. San Diego Union music critic George Varga will talk 
about jazz and its many mutations in the 1970s and '80s. . . . By the way, the 
Athenaeum has been adding to its jazz collection -- on tape, CD and vinyl -- 
and a $35 membership provides you access to the whole works. A librarian at the 
La Jolla cultural center has about 1,000 jazz recordings, including 500 
records, more than 200 tapes and 200 CDs. There's a five-album limit per 
checkout. . . . Guitarist Joe D'Orio opens three nights at Diego's Loft 
tonight. . . . Pianist Jimmy Corsaro and singer Sharon Andrews play Wednesday 
through Saturday nights at The Library on Mission Gorge Road, a piano lounge in 
the form of two living rooms filled with books.

COUNCIL URGES MAJOR CHANGES FOR U.S. DIET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Washington Post 
</P>

<DATELINE>

WASHINGTON

<TEXT>
<P>
In the most comprehensive scientific report on diet and health to date, the 
National Research Council on Wednesday called for broad changes in American 
eating habits and gave specific recommendations to eat much less fat, eat more 
fruits, vegetables and starches and avoid high-dose vitamin and mineral 
supplements. 
</P>
<P>
The council recommended that people daily eat five or more half-cup portions of 
fruits and vegetables and a minimum of six portions of starches such as breads, 
cereals and beans. The recommendations would roughly double the average amounts 
of these items eaten by Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The council also said it found no proof that calcium and fiber supplements 
confer any health benefit. While the panel did not conclude that daily 
vitamin-mineral supplements are harmful, it found no evidence that they are 
beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendations were prepared by a committee of 19 diet and health experts 
created to resolve conflicting dietary advice that in recent years has come 
from various private and governmental bodies. The panel took three years to 
examine nearly 6,000 studies and compile a 1,400-page report that distills the 
various findings into one set of dietary guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Among other conclusions of the report were these: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Evidence linking coffee to heart disease and cancer is inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Urges Sugar Limits 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sugar has not been established as a risk factor for any chronic disease 
other than cavities. Refined sugar, like that used in cakes and cookies, should 
be limited, however, since it contributes calories with no essential nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Food additives do not appear to have contributed to the overall risk of 
cancer in humans. 
</P>
<P>
 -- There is no evidence that pesticides or natural toxins in food contribute 
significantly to cancer risk in the United States. But the risks for 
simultaneous exposure to these compounds has not been adequately tested. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that a committee of the National Research Council, the 
working arm of the National Academy of Sciences, has made such definitive 
dietary recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cites Confusion 
</P>
<P>
"Many people may be confused by the vast amount of advice given in many forms 
about what to eat," said Dr. Arno G. Motulsky, chairman of the Committee on 
Diet and Health. "Some may have delayed making changes in their diets until 
they are more convinced that scientists have reached consensus. We hope our 
report will help these individuals move from inaction and complacency to 
action." 
</P>
<P>
The committee said the risk of heart disease could be reduced by at least 20% 
if the public followed the fat and cholesterol guidelines. Americans currently 
consume 37% of their calories as fat. The committee endorsed a reduction to 30% 
-- as many other health groups have recommended -- but it acknowledged that 
level is only "moderately" low in fat and said further reductions would provide 
additional benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The committee also said the risk of cancer of the colon, lung and stomach could 
be reduced by sharply increasing consumption of fruits and vegetables, 
particularly citrus fruits and green and yellow vegetables.

It was 12 years ago that the jury reached its verdict about Randall Dale Adams: 
guilty as charged in the murder of Dallas policeman Robert Wood. On Wednesday, 
Adams was given another chance to prove he didn't pull the trigger, and he owes 
it to a movie. 
</P>
<P>
A Texas appeals court in Austin Wednesday ruled that Adams' murder conviction 
be set aside, based largely on new facts brought forward in the critically 
acclaimed documentary, "The Thin Blue Line." 
</P>
<P>
The strange and perhaps tragic case of Randall Dale Adams, 40, is one that came 
to the attention of New York film maker Errol Morris by accident, grew to be an 
all-consuming project and finally, with the release of the film last August, 
became a cause celebre. 
</P>
<P>
As of late last year, more than 15,000 people had signed petitions pleading for 
Adams' release. On some days, it seemed there had been progress, while on 
others it seemed that the cause was lost. Then, finally, came the ruling from 
the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, which said that the prosecution suppressed 
evidence and knowingly allowed perjured testimony during Adams' 1977 trial. 
</P>
<P>
Adams is being transferred back to the Dallas County Jail from a Texas prison 
while the district attorney's office decides whether there is enough evidence 
to retry the case. Adams' lawyer, Randy Schaffer, said Wednesday that his 
now-famous client is trying to remain calm in the face of good news. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, after 12 years, there isn't a lot of emotion either way," said Schaffer 
about Adams' reaction to the court decision. "Until the case is over, said and 
done, it is still a pending case. Until this is behind him, he's still a 
prisoner." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Associated Press Wednesday, Adams said: "I have firmly 
believed someday, someway, somehow, I would prove my case. I didn't know how, 
when or why. I knew." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recants Testimony 
</P>
<P>
If Adams does go on trial again, the basic question will be what happened on 
the night of Nov. 28, 1976, when patrolman Wood was killed with five shots from 
a .22-caliber pistol. What would be different at a new trial is that David 
Harris, who was with Adams that night and was the prosecution's star witness, 
had recanted his testimony when filmed by Morris. The movie strongly suggests 
that Harris, who is now on Texas' Death Row for another slaying, killed Wood. 
</P>
<P>
Errol Morris had never heard of Randall Dale Adams when he came to Texas to 
make a movie in 1985. He was interested, instead, in a man named James Grigson, 
a Texas psychiatrist nicknamed "Dr. Death" because his testimony had helped 
send Adams and 26 others to Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of his research, he came across Adams and his story. At first, 
Morris didn't believe him. But as more and more facts checked out, he began to 
be swayed, and finally convinced. Thus began a three-year project that would 
become "The Thin Blue Line." 
</P>
<P>
The opening segment of the story is clear and undisputed. Adams, a high school 
graduate from Ohio with no criminal record, had traveled to Dallas because he 
had heard there was work to be found. About two weeks after his arrival, his 
car ran out of gas and a young man driving a 1972 Mercury Comet offered to give 
him a lift. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the car, which had been stolen the day before, was a 16-year-old 
named David Harris with an extensive criminal record. He had grown up in Vidor, 
Tex., which over the years had developed a reputation as one of the toughest 
towns in the state. 
</P>
<P>
The two spent the day together. They drank beer, smoked marijuana and pawned 
some tools. That evening, they went to a drive-in theater where a soft-core 
porn double feature was playing. It is here that the two stories diverged. 
Adams claimed that he tired of "The Swinging Cheerleaders" and his young 
companion halfway through the feature and that the two parted company before 10 
p.m. In Adams' story, he was asleep in his own apartment when Wood was killed. 
</P>
<P>
Harris said at the time that it was after midnight when the two left the 
drive-in. He claimed that Adams was driving when a patrol car stopped them 
because their lights were out. 
</P>
<P>
When Wood approached, he was gunned down by the driver of the car. Wood's 
partner, Teresa Turko, opened fire as the car sped off. She would later testify 
that the driver of the car had bushy hair like Adams'. But what jurors were not 
told was that the only description Turko could give in her original report was 
that the driver was wearing a coat with a turned-up fur collar. 
</P>
<P>
That, however, was only one of several things the jury, as well as the defense 
lawyers, were not told. They did not know that one surprise eyewitness who 
named Adams as the killer had originally been unable to pick him out of a 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Harris was arrested in connection with the case in Vidor a month after the 
killing. All charges against him were dropped after Adams was convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Adams was sentenced to death, but the U.S. Supreme Court ordered a stay one 
week before he was to be executed. Ultimately, Gov. Bill Clements commuted the 
sentence to life in prison. Subsequent requests for a new trial were denied. 
</P>
<P>
Morris came on the scene and began to form the theory that it had been Harris, 
not Adams, who had committed murder. 
</P>
<P>
"At the point I met Harris, I had serious suspicions about the entire case," 
said Morris in an interview Wednesday. "Harris had indicated he would never 
forget the look in the cop's eyes, which is a peculiar thing to say considering 
he claimed he was slumped down in the back of a car." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Causes Major Stir 
</P>
<P>
When the movie came out, it caused a major stir in Dallas, which the 
distributors said was intended. In the movie and later interviews, Harris 
virtually confessed to the murder. 
</P>
<P>
"We designed our distribution plan so that it could make a difference," said 
Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman of Miramax Films. "We wanted to bring this movie 
to the attention of the people that mattered. We set the goal to accomplish a 
retrial and later an exoneration of Randall. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time there was a newsworthy event, the film would reemerge and keep the 
issue alive," he said. "We were aware that by keeping the film going, we could 
put pressure on and activate people to step out." 
</P>
<P>
Last Nov. 30, based on evidence presented in the movie, a hearing was held in 
Dallas to determine if a new trial should be recommended. Schaffer, Adams' 
lawyer, asked Harris point blank if Adams had killed the policeman. 
</P>
<P>
"No, he did not," Harris said. "Randall Adams knew nothing about this offense 
and was not in the car at the time." 
</P>
<P>
With that, Judge Larry Baraka said that in his court, Adams would have been 
found innocent and sent the case to the appellate level for a final ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, those working for Adams' release suffered a major setback when he 
was refused parole despite Baraka's strong backing. And that refusal made the 
decision Wednesday all the sweeter. 
</P>
<P>
"My response is one of great joy. The nightmare is over," said the film's 
producer, Mark Lipson. "I started to feel a sort of sick feeling when he was 
denied parole that we would enter a downward spiral and our energy would not be 
able to last. I was nervous that the storm had blown over in Texas and things 
would go back to the status quo." 
</P>
<P>
In Columbus, Ohio, Adams' mother, Mildred, was basking in the news. Her home 
had been wall-to-wall people all day. 
</P>
<P>
"I just prayed and prayed last night that God would work this out," she said. 
"And I told God, 'I know you're bigger than the state of Texas, and I just 
don't know what to do anymore.' 
</P>
<P>
"So there is justice in Texas after all."

TOWER FONDLING OF 2 WOMEN AT AF BASE TOLD 
</P>

One section of the material on John Tower that has attracted attention of 
senators considering his nomination as defense secretary concerns two visits 
the former senator made to Bergstrom Air Force Base in Austin, Tex., in 
1976-78, when he allegedly appeared to be drunk and fondled two women, 
according to informed sources. 
</P>
<P>
Retired Air Force Sgt. Bob Jackson first told the Senate Armed Services 
Committee and later the FBI of the two incidents at Bergstrom. Jackson, who was 
the noncommissioned officer in charge of base public relations and VIP tours, 
said he observed both incidents. 
</P>
<P>
During the two tours of the base, Tower "had liquor on his breath and he had 
trouble talking and was staggering out of the car and up the steps," according 
to Jackson's account. 
</P>
<P>
In one incident, Jackson told the FBI, when Tower was touring the office of the 
base chief of maintenance, "a secretary started to get up and Tower put his 
hand on her shoulder as she started to rise. His hand slid off her shoulder and 
onto her breast. She drew back and nothing was said. There was no great 
caressing or fondling. It was just untoward and unseemly." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reports Hand on Rump 
</P>
<P>
In the second incident, "an enlisted female crew chief on an F-4 aircraft was 
standing at attention or parade rest and Tower was told her name and put his 
hand on her shoulder, and it traveled down, resting right on her rump for a 
short period of time," according to Jackson's account. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson told the FBI that three or four other military personnel witnessed the 
incidents and that they discussed them afterward. One person felt Tower was not 
out of line, but a captain identified by name in the report said that Tower 
"was getting a free feel." 
</P>
<P>
When reached at his home Wednesday in Missouri, Jackson, 54, an intelligence 
technician who retired from the Air Force in 1978, confirmed his descriptions. 
"I stand by my statement to the FBI," he said. "All I know is what I saw." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson added: "Had she been my daughter, well, he is too little to hit -- that 
would have put me down to his level. But, if I did what I wanted (to do) at the 
time, you'd be talking to me now from Leavenworth." Leavenworth, Kan., is the 
site of a military prison. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wrote Letter to Nunn 
</P>
<P>
According to sources, Jackson first made his allegations in a letter to Armed 
Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) and later repeated them to the 
FBI. 
</P>
<P>
(An FBI official confirmed to The Times Wednesday evening that the bureau had 
been informed of Jackson's allegations but said the incidents had not been 
probed in depth because they had happened so long ago. 
</P>
<P>
("The investigation regarding drinking and alcohol abuse focused principally on 
the 1980s," Milton Ahlerich, the FBI's assistant director for congressional and 
public affairs, said. 
</P>
<P>
(After Jackson's allegations came to the FBI's attention, bureau agents 
"discussed it with the White House and Chairman Nunn," Ahlerich said. Nunn, he 
added, "raised no objection" to the bureau's decision not to pursue the 
allegation extensively because "it fell outside the focus of the investigation 
that he wanted.") 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said he had been told by the FBI agent who interviewed him that the 
bureau had another witness who corroborated his account, but that could not be 
independently confirmed Wednesday. One source who has read the Tower material 
said he was not aware of any refutation of Jackson's account. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Tower refused to comment on Jackson's statements, and the White 
House had no comment.

ALIEN SMUGGLER'S DAY: DOZEN 'COUSINS' ABOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the parlance of alien smugglers at Los Angeles International Airport, 
everybody has "cousins." With a knowing smile, a man who all too readily 
identified himself as Jose Luis Hernandez admitted that he had just boarded 
three "cousins" on Eastern Airlines Flight 80 bound for New York, via Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, they are illegal, but they're my cousins," said "Hernandez," a winning 
young man dressed in designer blue jeans and a white jacket. 
</P>
<P>
Later, when asked about the six additional passengers he had just presented 
with tickets at Gate 65 to board the red-eye flight, Hernandez was not daunted. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, they're my cousins, too," he said, all but winking. 
</P>
<P>
This was Tuesday night, just 24 hours after Immigration and Naturalization 
Service agents apprehended 69 suspected illegal immigrants boarding Flight 80 
en route to New York and the promise of jobs. Earlier that same day, 79 others 
had been taken off the same flight when it stopped in Atlanta for refueling. 
</P>
<P>
INS officials described Eastern's flight, which departs daily from LAX at 10:50 
p.m., as an unwitting conduit in a massive transcontinental smuggling operation 
that apparently moved several thousand illegals out of Los Angeles in the last 
month alone. Some of the aliens arrested said they paid as much as $4,000 for a 
package deal -- transportation from home, housing, the Eastern plane ticket and 
a job in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The series of airport arrests, including the detention Wednesday of 27 
suspected illegal immigrants in North Carolina aboard a Piedmont Airlines 
flight, has focused new attention on Los Angeles' role as a hub for the 
nation's force of illegal workers. 
</P>
<P>
While the fact that Los Angeles is an attractive port of entry for aliens is 
widely documented, the use of flights from Los Angeles International to 
dispatch the workers to destinations throughout the continental United States 
is less well known, and on this topic Hernandez is an expert. 
</P>
<P>
There were no agents working the gate Tuesday night, he was free to ply his 
trade and, in a limited fashion, discuss it. In all, Hernandez boarded about 12 
of his "cousins." 
</P>
<P>
The young man was uncommonly forthcoming when asked directly if he was a 
smuggler of aliens. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I'm a smuggler," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, a Salvadoran who said he lives in Orange County, said it is his job 
to meet illegals who have crossed the U.S. border at Tijuana. He meets them 
near Santa Ana. From there, he escorts them to LAX and makes sure they board 
Eastern Flight 80. 
</P>
<P>
Was he not afraid, given the recent INS attention to the flight? 
</P>
<P>
"What are they going to do to me?" he replied. "Send me home? I could be back 
in no time." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez said that using a commercial aircraft is a lucrative way to smuggle 
aliens. 
</P>
<P>
"It is easy to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pressed on how the tickets, which INS officials say are purchased in bulk, were 
obtained, Hernandez smiled and said: "I don't know anything about that." 
</P>
<P>
Other questions -- such as "How much did your 'cousins' pay you?" or "Who are 
your bosses?" -- were answered in much the same way. 
</P>
<P>
His "cousins" Tuesday arrived in twos and threes, all of them young men. Most 
carried no baggage and wore drab clothes. Some held grocery bags filled with 
belongings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Airline Workers Pass Them 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez escorted each set of his "cousins," all of them Spanish speakers, 
inside Terminal 6 to Gate 65. The airline workers checked their tickets and 
boarding passes, and then left them alone. They sat together in rows, waiting 
to board the plane. Hernandez hovered around the scene, keeping his charges in 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
When Flight 80 was announced, six who were sitting together joined the line of 
passengers waiting to board. Approached by a reporter, who assured them that he 
was not an INS agent, the six said in Spanish that they were illegal immigrants 
headed for New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a job there yet, but I hope to," said one alien, who said he was 
from the Mexican state of Zacatecas. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not looking for trouble," one of the others interjected. "We just want 
to feed our families." 
</P>
<P>
And with that, they boarded the flight without incident, and apparently managed 
to complete their journey to New York. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-seven others on another flight were not so lucky Wednesday. They were 
detained in Charlotte, N.C., by federal agents who boarded a Piedmont jetliner 
and asked for documentation of U.S. citizenship or legal residency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tipped by Irate Passenger 
</P>
<P>
Supervisory INS Agent David Carmichael in Charlotte said agents had been tipped 
by an irate passenger who said there were New York-bound illegals on the 
flight. Recent publicity about the airport apprehensions prompted the 
unidentified passenger to notify authorities when the plane landed, Carmichael 
said. 
</P>
<P>
According to federal officials, the 27 had flown on another airline from Los 
Angeles to Phoenix and then transferred to the Piedmont flight, which was to 
have taken them to New York. 
</P>
<P>
One of the suspected aliens, Mario Gonzales, said he had borrowed $3,000 and 
paid it to a man who arranged ground transportation to Los Angeles and then air 
transportation to New York. He said the man promised him a job at a 
construction site in New York, where he would be paid $30 to $40 a day, far 
below union scale. 
</P>
<P>
INS officials in Atlanta, meanwhile, said Wednesday that smugglers may start 
dumping the blocks of airline tickets purchased in advance of the recent 
arrests. 
</P>
<P>
"They've already purchased their tickets before they even know who is going to 
buy the ticket or who is going to pay for the smuggling process," said Neil 
Jacobs, assistant INS district director for investigators in Atlanta. "Probably 
even more as a result of Monday's and Tuesday's operations, you are going to 
see more and more smugglers attempting to unload these tickets, and get as much 
money as they can before we really start scrutinizing everybody." 
</P>
<P>
INS officials in Los Angeles offered no new details Wednesday on their part of 
the investigation. Officials said the situation would be discussed today when 
Harold Ezell, INS western regional commissioner, meets with Los Angeles 
District Director Ernest Gustafson. The two have been out of town, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff researcher Edith Stanley in Atlanta contributed to this story.

India's government has slashed defense spending and diverted funds to fight 
hunger and illiteracy and provide housing for the homeless. The unprecedented 
reduction in defense spending was contained in the government's budget for 
1989-90, introduced in Parliament by Finance Minister S. B. Chavan. India will 
spend $133 million less on defense in the 1989-90 fiscal year compared to the 
previous year, Chavan said. He pledged to spend $1.1 billion on aid for hunger, 
illiteracy and the homeless, an increase of $333 million from last year. The 
added funds for social programs will be raised directly from taxing the 
upper-middle classes, including an 8% surcharge on annual incomes of more than 
$3,300.

Riverside County joined four other counties in implementing state Proposition 
90, which gives homeowners 55 or older a tax break by allowing them to transfer 
the assessed value of a home they are selling to a new home in another county. 
The county Board of Supervisors voted 4 to 1 for implementation after hearing 
testimony from the California Assn. of Realtors, the American Assn. of Retired 
Persons and other supporters. San Diego, Orange, Kern and San Mateo counties 
have already voted to implement the measure, which was passed by 69% of the 
voters statewide last November.

Three animal-rights protesters, who ended their weeklong occupation of a huge 
construction crane in Berkeley, face misdemeanor trespassing charges, a 
University of California spokesman said. But UC Berkeley spokesman Ray Kolvig 
said the three could also face felony charges if damage to the crane is found 
to exceed $1,000. Kolvig said the stunt, to protest construction of a new 
animal research facility on campus, cost the university and construction 
companies an estimated $30,000 a day by disrupting work on a new genetics and 
plant research building.

House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) angrily denied a report that he once 
threatened to expose a federal bank regulator as a homosexual in order to 
promote the interests of Texas savings and loan officials. "The story . . . is 
preposterous," Wright told reporters, referring to an article in the Washington 
Times that said such an allegation was being reviewed by the House Ethics 
Committee as it concludes its investigation of Wright. Wright is charged with 
bringing extraordinary pressure on the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to be more 
lenient with financially troubled Texas thrifts and allow them to plead their 
cases directly to top officials in Washington. The Washington Times said the 
allegation accused him of threatening federal officials in Washington with 
"blowing the whistle" on a Texas regulator's homosexuality unless the S&amp;L 
executives were allowed to circumvent that level with their pleas.

MCCARTHY'S EXIT FROM GOVERNOR'S RACE FORCES DEMOCRATS TO TAKE STOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Their most seasoned candidate just dropped out. Their least experienced has 
done almost nothing politically for a year -- but continues to lead the polls. 
Their most daring contender is acting strangely cautious. Their most dogged, if 
conventional, competitor is the experts' pick to win. And some people are still 
shopping for a new face. 
</P>
<P>
This is the view down in the trenches of the Democratic primary election 
campaign for governor. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen months before the 1990 primary voting, Democrats are taking stock of 
their prospects after the announcement Wednesday by Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy 
that he will not run for governor but will seek reelection to the No. 2 job. 
</P>
<P>
Their inventory of questions goes like this: How to explain San Francisco Mayor 
Dianne Feinstein's strength in the polls despite a year of political 
retirement? Why is California Controller Gray Davis reluctant to take a gamble 
and stir up the race with a bold stroke? Is the careful brick-and-mortar 
politics of Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp a formula for victory like many 
experts figure? Is a surprise entrant in the offing? And what of McCarthy's 
future? 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy was the party's most experienced statewide contender -- but remains 
personally dispirited and politically weakened by the drubbing he took last 
year in the U.S. Senate race at the hands of Pete Wilson, the same man the 
Republicans are likely to field for governor. 
</P>
<P>
Some of McCarthy's supporters believe that he will now hang back in the shadows 
this election, hoping to regain strength and re-emerge as a candidate for 
higher office later. Other Democrats think Wednesday's announcement spells the 
end of McCarthy's long climb up. "Leo will never be as strong as he is today," 
longtime Los Angeles political consultant Joe Cerrell said. "I think he's 
peaked." 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy's withdrawal from contention leaves a field of three Democrats running 
for governor -- and, who knows, one or two more could jump in late. At this 
point, party leaders, political professionals and activists say there is reason 
to cheer, and cause for fear, as the campaign takes shape. 
</P>
<P>
The good news for Democrats is the belief that political winds are shifting in 
favor of more government activism. Polls show it. Democrats sense it; 
Republicans are openly adjusting for it. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a growing marketplace for moderate-to-liberal Democratic ideas," said 
Richard Maullin of Santa Monica, veteran pollster and an adviser to candidate 
Davis. "The public is ready for an agenda that is seemingly perfect for a 
Democratic candidate." 
</P>
<P>
The not-so-good news is that many Democrats believe that none of their party's 
would-be governors sufficiently stirs the voters. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty depressing for the Democrats," said Allison Thomas, a Sherman Oaks 
businesswoman and party activist. She is representative of a group of hungry, 
youngish Democrats who are not satisfied with the existing lineup of candidates 
or the tone of their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, as explained by Maullin, is that voters may be thinking more 
sympathetically about Democratic ideas but they have not found a Democratic 
leader who they believe can make good on their promises. "There is a crisis of 
confidence for Democrats, a deteriorating sense that government cannot meet the 
agenda they are spelling out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
This, of course, comes as no shock to Democratic contenders. 
</P>
<P>
From their positions in the government, both Van de Kamp and Davis are 
scrambling to establish "can-do" reputations. 
</P>
<P>
Brandishing an AK-47 on the floor of the state Assembly, Van de Kamp has taken 
an uncharacteristically showy lead in the legislative campaign to ban assault 
rifles. And next week, he will personally step before the California Supreme 
Court -- and the news media -- to argue the merits of the voter-passed 
insurance reform initiative, Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, whose office offers fewer such natural political possibilities, is 
trying not to be forgotten, however. He announced Wednesday that he is starting 
a new publicity campaign to identify wasteful government spending. The first of 
his "taxpayer watchdog" reprimands was awarded to the state Department of 
Conservation. Davis said the department billed taxpayers $13,988 in taxicab 
fares for the delivery of documents. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein, although without public office right now, has joined the 
competition, producing a polished 8-by-10 brochure for Democratic opinion 
leaders that gushes over her nine years as mayor. She describes herself as the 
"first American public official" to organize a government campaign to cope with 
AIDS. The brochure does not mention the $77-million budget deficit she left the 
city in 1988, which some observers believe will haunt her throughout a 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp continues to be the favorite of Establishment Democrats and 
political insiders during the early going. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters argue his mix of liberal politics and law enforcement experience 
offers the strongest combination of any Democratic contender. Unlike all others 
who are testing the waters, Van de Kamp has allowed that there will be no 
turning back. His approach is the most methodical and traditional of campaigns 
-- working each of the party's many constituencies for support, and along the 
way building a huge political staff of national standing. 
</P>
<P>
Incrementally, the strategy has paid off. Last week for instance, Van de Kamp 
traveled to Bal Harbour, Fla., to the AFL-CIO Executive Council meeting and 
proved himself the favorite of many union leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a guy, each step, who passes the test," said Paul Maslin, the 
Washington-based pollster who has signed up with the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
But even among Democrats there is doubt whether Van de Kamp can sustain his 
dual image as a law-and-order man and also a liberal. "He opposes the death 
penalty and supported (ousted Chief Justice) Rose Bird. I don't see how someone 
like that can survive what the Republicans are sure to dish out," activist 
Allison Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing Wednesday that he will not run for governor, McCarthy refrained 
from endorsing anyone else, even though such a plan had been discussed with Van 
de Kamp recently, according to sources familiar with the talks between the two 
men. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who said that would happen were a little bit out ahead of 
themselves," McCarthy said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
For her part, Feinstein in recent weeks has gone from a political question mark 
to a serious contender. 
</P>
<P>
On the strength of her first-place showings last month and one year ago among 
Democrats sampled by the California Poll of Mervin Field, Feinstein said she 
could not resist mounting an exploratory campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, investment banker Richard Blum, promised her a $1-million 
grubstake. And she is now hurrying to build a political organization and 
establish connections in Southern California, where she is little traveled. 
</P>
<P>
It was learned that Feinstein is trying to accomplish both goals in dramatic 
fashion by seeking the endorsement and political help of the Waxman-Berman 
political organization of Reps. Howard Berman (D-Panorama City) and Henry 
Waxman (D-Los Angeles). So far, the organization has not committed to any of 
the candidates. To make herself better known here, aides said she will soon 
lease a Century City apartment. 
</P>
<P>
In his exploratory bid, Davis has resisted repeated and urgent advice from some 
of his backers to be more bold in trying to improve his underdog position. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the normally aggressive Davis has chosen to move cautiously, fueling 
speculation that he ultimately will drop out and wait for a future opening. 
"He's probably at the point in the campaign that his only opportunity lies in 
some truly heroic act," said one supporter who asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
At least three potential surprise candidates are being discussed in political 
circles. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Ueberroth has been flirting with running for governor once he leaves his 
job as baseball commissioner at the end of the month -- but always as a 
Republican. 
</P>
<P>
Now, some Democrats reportedly are urging him to consider switching parties and 
run in their primary. Democrats note that Ueberroth has hinted that his views 
on at least some social issues are more liberal than the GOP platform. At the 
same time, they argue, his reputation for can-do has wide appeal to the 
electorate, regardless of party. 
</P>
<P>
"A delegation of Democrats did talk to him. He received them politely. But he 
is a Republican and he doesn't have any intention of changing," said one GOP 
strategist who is familiar with Ueberroth. Neither this source nor others who 
confirmed the overture would say who the Democrats were. 
</P>
<P>
Two other men are considered improbable but nonetheless attract speculation. 
</P>
<P>
One is Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, who maintains his high standing in the 
polls and is heading toward a landslide reelection April 11. He has run for 
governor twice before and some wonder if he will not be tempted to do it again. 
The other is Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento), who risks a reputation as a 
perennial office-shopper as he takes a glance at this contest. So far, he has 
shown an unwillingness to risk his seat in Congress.

In a story in Thursday's Times about the Democratic race for governor, a party 
activist was quoted as saying that candidate John K. Van de Kamp, the state 
attorney general, supported the 1986 reelection of California Chief Justice 
Rose Elizabeth Bird. Actually, Van de Kamp was neutral in the bitter election, 
which resulted in Bird's ouster. The attorney general took his stand on grounds 
that as the most frequent litigator before the high court, it was not proper 
for him to take a position for or against.

LABOR IN VEHEMENT ATTACK ON DEUKMEJIAN PRISONER WORK PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Organized labor vehemently declared its opposition on Wednesday to Gov. George 
Deukmejian's plan to require prison convicts to help pay for their keep by 
working, contending that the proposal would create "a captive labor force 
surrounded by armed guards." 
</P>
<P>
The plan, a major legislative initiative announced by Deukmejian in his State 
of the State speech in January, flew into a wall of opposition from labor at a 
hearing of the Assembly Labor and Employment Committee. 
</P>
<P>
It was defended by top-level Administration officials, including James A. 
Rowland, director of corrections, who insisted to the committee that "we don't 
want to displace one law-abiding worker" by putting prisoners to work in 
privately operated enterprises at prison sites. 
</P>
<P>
From a prisoner's presumed minimum wage earnings, 20% would be withheld to help 
pay the room and board, 15% would be deducted for restitution to victims and 
40% would be taken for a mandatory savings program. Inmates could spend the 
remaining 25% as they wished. 
</P>
<P>
John F. Henning, the crusty veteran executive secretary-treasurer of the 
California Labor Federation, AFL-CIO, denounced the proposal as a "turning back 
of the clock of history" that would be seized upon as "the ideal for the 
employer who wants to exploit." 
</P>
<P>
"It is a captive labor force surrounded by armed guards," he boomed out in the 
deep baritone voice of an old-fashioned union organizer. "It is turning back 
the clock of history to foist this on prisoners . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The California Constitution has long prohibited the use of state prisoners to 
perform work for private employers. Many attempts to repeal the prohibition 
have been killed by organized labor, which fears, among other things, that 
prisoners would displace civilian workers. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has proposed that 7,000 inmates, the same number now enrolled in 
prison industry work programs, participate in his program. He has said it would 
help ease the budget crunch and allow taxpayer dollars to be spent for services 
other than prisons. 
</P>
<P>
The governor also has indicated that if the proposal does not receive the 
required two-thirds favorable vote of the Democratic-dominated Legislature, he 
may sponsor a ballot initiative in 1990 seeking to implement the program. 
</P>
<P>
Henning warned Wednesday that "bureaucrats" could be counted upon to vastly 
expand the working convict program. "They (the bureaucrats) are willing to lick 
the paint off the walls of San Quentin to get this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he favors expansion of labor-endorsed work programs that enroll 222 
apprentices for skilled crafts and the prison industries program that involves 
7,000 participants. These programs operate under many restrictions designed to 
keep them from doing jobs that otherwise might be done by civilian labor. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by committee chairman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) if labor would be 
prepared to compromise on Deukmejian's proposal, Henning shot back: "Not on 
convict labor." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Bill Baker (R-Danville), legislative author of Deukmejian's 
proposed constitutional amendment, and others noted, however, that 60,000 
convicts a year are being released from crowded California prisons, whose 
population is expected to soar from 72,927 last year to 110,230 in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
He and officials of the Department of Corrections said these released convicts 
must be provided with "meaningful" jobs or they are almost certain to commit 
more crimes and return to prison at taxpayer expense. 
</P>
<P>
Under the project, modeled after a program for California Youth Authority 
offenders, private businesses would acquire space at prison sites and employ 
adult convicts to make products that could be sold on the open market. 
Currently, such prison-made items as furniture can be sold only to government 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The committee was told by an optical laboratory operator and a sheet metal 
contractor that goods manufactured by the Youth Authority inmates in its "free 
venture" work program have undercut their businesses.

PURDY'S HALF-BROTHER HELD ON ILLEGAL EXPLOSIVES COUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
STOCKTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The half-brother of Patrick Edward Purdy -- the man who killed five children 
and wounded 30 others here in a schoolyard rampage with an assault rifle -- was 
arrested after he allegedly told Stockton investigators that he and Purdy had 
plotted to randomly kill a police officer in nearby Modesto, authorities said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Albert E. Gulart Jr., 20, was being held in Modesto -- with bail set at 
$500,000 -- after his arrest Tuesday on charges of possessing illegal 
explosives, said Capt. David J. Scott, head of investigations for the Modesto 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Gulart also possessed a Mac-10 semiautomatic assault pistol -- registered to 
Purdy, who killed himself after the Jan. 17 attack on the children -- and a 
semiautomatic M-1 military-style carbine, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
Stockton police, who interviewed Gulart as part of their investigation into 
Purdy's background after the killings, said that Gulart told them that he and 
Purdy had plotted to kill a Modesto police officer. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the plans included ambushing a policeman, possibly a 
motorcycle officer, at a Modesto bridge. Police said Gulart told them that 
Purdy had suggested that the pair wait until summer when officers would not be 
wearing their bulletproof vests because of the San Joaquin Valley heat. 
</P>
<P>
Modesto authorities became concerned about the safety of their own 
schoolchildren last Friday after Stockton police relayed a cryptic quote 
attributed to Gulart. 
</P>
<P>
Scott quoted Gulart as telling Stockton police, "Patrick was successful in what 
he did, and I have a hard time driving by any school." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what that means," Scott said, "but we weren't going to wait to 
find out." 
</P>
<P>
Scott said Gulart was kept under surveillance full time until he was arrested 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gulart has been described as Purdy's closest friend. The two were together two 
years ago when Purdy, enraged at their mother, Kathleen Toscano, smashed the 
windshield of the woman's car, police said. Gulart, a juvenile at the time, was 
also with Purdy when his half-brother was arrested in El Dorado County for 
firing a gun in a restricted area. 
</P>
<P>
The two were also together, police said, three or four days before Purdy opened 
fire with an AK-47 assault rife on the children at Cleveland Elementary School 
and then killed himself with a handgun. Police say, however, that Gulart is not 
suspected of any complicity in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Scott said the explosives discovered in Gulart's trailer outside Modesto 
included blasting caps and a box of high-powered cylindrical fireworks, 2 1/2 
inches long by 2 inches wide. He said the rifle and assault pistol were sent to 
California Department of Justice officials to determine whether they had been 
altered to fire automatically. 
</P>
<P>
When Modesto police took Gulart into custody, they also arrested his uncle, 
Tommy Gulart, 29, for a parole violation. He had been relased from prison on 
Jan. 29 after serving time for assault with a deadly weapon and was charged 
with being in a place where firearms are present. 
</P>
<P>
Gulart's arraignment is scheduled for today in Modesto.

'NOT BURNED OUT,' ARGUELLES SAYS OF DECISION TO RETIRE FROM COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP HAGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Justice John A. Arguelles on Wednesday rejected speculation that judicial 
"burnout," caused by a burdensome caseload, prompted his unexpected retirement 
after only two years on the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
"I have neither burned out nor been frustrated," said Arguelles in his first 
public statements about his surprise retirement since he announced his decision 
in November. "The workload is heavy, but that comes with the territory, and I 
think all of the justices handle the caseload well." 
</P>
<P>
But Arguelles, meeting with reporters on the day he officially left office, did 
acknowledge that being away from family and friends while he commuted between 
Southern California and the court's headquarters here was a factor in his 
decision to retire. 
</P>
<P>
"I had anticipated spending longer on the court," said the 61-year old jurist. 
"But there is a great deal of separation from your family and perhaps I didn't 
fully comprehend the effect that has." 
</P>
<P>
There had been speculation in legal circles that the court's backlog of nearly 
400 cases -- about half of them legally complex death-penalty appeals -- had 
led to Arguelles' resignation, along with the strain of weekend travel. 
</P>
<P>
Arguelles said Wednesday that he wants to leave the court while still in good 
health and that he would be pursuing unspecified professional opportunities in 
the future. He said he wants to spend more "quality time" with his wife, 
Martha, who is a senior partner in an Orange County interpreting and 
translating firm, and other members of his family. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd kind of like to walk into retirement, rather than be carried into it," he 
said. "Some simple pleasures, like riding the waves at Laguna Beach this summer 
or walking the dog along the greenbelt in Irvine, sound pretty good to me." 
</P>
<P>
Arguelles noted that it "made sense" to step down now while the court is 
implementing a new procedure that requires decisions to be issued within 90 
days of argument before the justices. During this transitional period, the 
court's monthly calendar of cases to be argued has been temporarily reduced. 
</P>
<P>
The justice's successor has not yet been named by Gov. George Deukmejian. Four 
state appellate court justices -- Patricia D. Benke, H. Walter Croskey, Joyce 
L. Kennard and Fred W. Marler -- are under consideration. Arguelles said all 
the potential nominees had "impeccable credentials and solid reputations." 
</P>
<P>
Arguelles conceded that he would have liked to spend more time on the high 
court to establish a longer "track record," but noted that he had already spent 
23 years on the Municipal, Superior and Court of Appeal bench. 
</P>
<P>
Discussing a wide range of other subjects, Arguelles: 
</P>
<P>
* Characterized the newly aligned court under Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas as 
"stable, efficient and productive" and described himself and his colleagues as 
"moderate voices," seeking the "best possible solutions" to complex legal 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
He cautiously predicted there would be no recurrence of the bitter and 
tumultuous election two years ago in which Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird 
and two other court members were turned out of office by the voters. "I don't 
anticipate that there will be a repetition of a 1986-type election in the years 
to follow," he said. 
</P>
<P>
* Said he expects the court to move faster in deciding capital cases in the 
future, now that virtually all major questions about the death penalty have 
been resolved. He noted that in less than two years, the court under Lucas has 
issued 69 capital rulings (upholding the death penalty in 49 cases), compared 
to 68 capital decisions (upholding the death penalty four times) by the court 
in eight years under Bird. 
</P>
<P>
* Discounted the significance of occasional splits in court votes among the 
five justices on the seven-member court who were appointed by Deukmejian. "We 
have seven very independent justices on this court," he said. "I think that's 
the way the public would want it. I don't think the public would want seven men 
marching in lock-step." 
</P>
<P>
* Said he will stay on the court by temporary special appointment to conclude 
work on several cases in which he has been participating. Arguelles will sit 
with the court next week in Sacramento, for example, when the justices hear 
argument over the constitutionality of Proposition 103, the insurance 
initiative passed in November. 
</P>
<P>
* Said that until his court work is complete, he will not consider specific 
offers among the wide range of professional opportunities that may be open to 
him in the future -- including law practice, arbitration and mediation, 
teaching and serving on corporate boards.

The General Assembly on Wednesday approved $416 million for the U.N. 
peacekeeping mission to help free Namibia from 74 years of South African rule. 
</P>
<P>
On April 1, the United Nations is to begin implementing a one-year plan to 
create the world's newest independent nation, thus settling the last major 
colonial problem in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa has run Namibia, or South-West Africa, since World War I, when it 
captured the former German colony. In December, Pretoria finally agreed to the 
plan to make the territory a sovereign state. 
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly was able to clear the last hurdle to implementing the plan 
after its budget subcommittee, overriding objections from several African 
nations, decided Tuesday night that U.N. peacekeepers in Namibia may buy goods 
from South Africa as long as it remains the cheapest supplier. 
</P>
<P>
Countries led by Zambia and Zimbabwe had delayed approval of the assessment by 
trying to enforce U.N. calls for embargoes on South African products.

S. AFRICA TO PERMIT MIXED NEIGHBORHOODS; 
</P>
<P>
FIRST SUCH INTEGRATION IN NEARLY 40 YEARS; LIMITED IMPACT SEEN 
</P>

<P>
A new law that will permit integrated neighborhoods in South Africa for the 
first time in nearly 40 years went into force Wednesday, but it is expected to 
affect only new townships and the few areas where blacks already live illegally 
in large numbers. 
</P>
<P>
The government, hoping the measure will ease international criticism of 
apartheid, its system of racial separation, hailed the Free Settlement Areas 
Act as a significant milestone on the road to apartheid reform. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very important development," Information Minister Stoffel van der Merwe 
said. "Now the whole principle of mixed residential areas has been introduced 
and we're dealing with a much more fluid, much more dynamic situation." 
</P>
<P>
But the government, in an effort to mollify its far-right opponents among the 
4.5 million whites, has said it remains committed to segregated neighborhoods 
for those who want them. 
</P>
<P>
Frederik W. de Klerk, leader of the ruling National Party and heir-apparent to 
ailing President Pieter W. Botha, vowed in a major policy speech last month 
that the government will continue to protect "group rights," the South African 
term for racially separate housing, schools and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
But De Klerk said the new legislation will begin to allow some people to form 
their own "groups" voluntarily, without regard to race. 
</P>
<P>
The new law establishes a Free Settlement Board to hear applications from areas 
that wish to declare themselves open. The board then makes recommendations to 
the president, who can declare the areas open. No final decisions are expected 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Schools and hospitals will remain segregated, at least at first, and the 
government says it has not decided how to deal with the new non-racial groups 
on the voters' rolls. Elections in South Africa are racially segregated; 
blacks, who account for three-fourths of the population, have no vote in 
national affairs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dozen Neighborhoods 
</P>
<P>
The government has said that a dozen neighborhoods have expressed interest in 
becoming open. Officials say the most likely candidates are new townships and 
several inner-city white districts -- Hillbrow in Johannesburg and Woodstock in 
Cape Town, for example -- where more than 50,000 blacks already live in 
defiance of the law. 
</P>
<P>
The white Conservative Party has demanded that the government enforce 
residential segregation more strictly, and some far-right whites have recently 
picketed and vandalized the houses of Indian families living in whites-only 
areas. Some of those Indian families have received death threats. 
</P>
<P>
The government tried last year to tighten up enforcement of the 1950 Group 
Areas Act, the apartheid cornerstone that divides South Africa into separate 
neighborhoods for whites, blacks, mixed-race Coloreds and Indians. 
</P>
<P>
But that move stalled because of a severe housing shortage in black areas and a 
judge's ruling that blacks could not be evicted from a whites-only area unless 
alternative accommodation can be found. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-apartheid activists, who want the Group Areas Act scrapped, complain that 
a law allowing some open areas will have little effect on the overall level of 
integration in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Most whites in the country live in comfortable suburbs, with neighborhood 
schools that have empty classrooms and hospitals with empty beds. Most blacks 
live in high-density townships with overcrowded schools and hospitals and long 
commutes to work. 
</P>
<P>
Critics also contend that high demand for housing among blacks will create a 
run on the few open areas and that this will quickly turn them into overcrowded 
slums. 
</P>
<P>
"You will have second-class areas, ultimately, receiving third-class services," 
Tony Leon, leader of the white liberal Progressive Federal Party on the 
Johannesburg City Council, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said Wednesday that he has 
released 230 of the estimated 1,000 political activists held without charge in 
South Africa. He promised to release an additional 50 by Friday. The black 
detainees, some held for as long as 32 months, agreed last month to suspend a 
mass hunger strike after Vlok promised at a meeting with Anglican Archbishop 
Desmond M. Tutu to free "substantial numbers" of them. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, the Justice Ministry announced that President Botha had 
commuted the death sentences of 16 prisoners -- a move that human rights groups 
said may indicate a softening of the government's attitude toward capital 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa, with 164 hangings in 1987 and 117 last year, has one of the 
highest per-capita execution rates of any country in the world. Among those 
reprieved Wednesday was Paul Setlaba, on death row for a murder conviction 
arising out of the 1985 black consumer boycott. The United Nations, among other 
groups, had appealed for clemency for Setlaba.

IT'S BEER DAY IN ICELAND -- AFTER 74 YEARS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jubilant Icelanders quaffed legal local lager for the first time in 74 years 
Wednesday when prohibition laws banning the sale of full-strength beer 
officially ended. 
</P>
<P>
Lines formed outside some of the 17 state liquor stores that hold the monopoly 
on selling take-home spirits. When the doors swung open at the Snorra Braut 
branch in central Reykjavik, there were cheers and applause. 
</P>
<P>
Two new pubs timed their opening day to coincide with "B-Day," and many 
restaurants and bars reported that their tables were booked up weeks in advance 
by Icelanders planning to celebrate their new freedom. 
</P>
<P>
In one new pub in Reykjavik, The Beer Cellar, a bell was rung at noon and 
customers were asked to observe a moment of silence before taking a gulp. 
</P>
<P>
Alcoholic drinks became illegal in Iceland in 1915 after a referendum, and 
although prohibition was repealed in 1933, beer containing more than 2.25% 
alcohol remained outlawed. 
</P>
<P>
The weak beer never gained popularity, and Icelanders who wanted to imbibe 
legally often resorted to the national drink called the Black Death, a 
mind-numbing, clear liquid that is 40% alcohol and tastes like vodka. 
</P>
<P>
Parliament finally passed a law legalizing beer in May and gave the island 
nation of 251,000 until March 1 to prepare for the change. 
</P>
<P>
After the moment of silence at The Beer Cellar, Magnus Sveinsson, president of 
the Reykjavik City Council, cut a ribbon and enjoyed the first glass of locally 
brewed suds. Each customer got a free glass of beer -- no little thing, 
considering that bars are charging $3.90 to $4.80 a glass. 
</P>
<P>
"This is indeed a world event," Sveinsson joked to the cameras, adding: "I am 
convinced Icelanders will learn to handle beer, seeing as Icelanders have 
always been open to foreign cultural influences." 
</P>
<P>
He urged people to take buses home, citing lines from "I Think I'll Walk Home," 
a song by pop star Valgeir Gudjonsson against drunken driving. 
</P>
<P>
The song, commissioned by the state Board of Alcoholism Prevention, was been 
played incessantly on radio and TV before "B-Day." 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers have carried ads warning that "Beer Is Alcohol," just in case any 
Icelanders have forgotten after 74 years. 
</P>
<P>
In Parliament a few days ago, Education Minister Svavar Gestsson accused the 
media of hyping the occasion. He said all efforts to educate the public about 
the evils of drink "have proved in vain against this terrible flood." 
</P>
<P>
Police said they are on heightened alert for drunken drivers. 
</P>
<P>
Iceland prides itself on having relatively low alcohol consumption, but intake 
has jumped from an annual 6.7 pints per person in 1981 to 9.45 pints now. 
</P>
<P>
The state, which controls the liquor supply, is exacting hefty levies on beer. 
A 24-can case of imported beer costs about $57.60. 
</P>
<P>
The price was expected to be even higher, but the government decided it should 
not outprice hard liquor. Before legalization, smuggled beer fetched about $70 
for a 24-can case. 
</P>
<P>
Beer over 5.6% alcoholic content remains banned, and pleading lack of storage 
space, the government has also restricted the number of imported brands to 
three -- Budweiser from the United States, Tuborg from Denmark and Kaiser from 
Austria. Two local breweries are providing four other brands.

CHINA ANGER GROWS OVER U.S., DISSIDENT 
</P>

<P>
China on Wednesday escalated its criticism of the United States for inviting 
China's leading dissident to a banquet in honor of Chinese leaders during 
President Bush's recent visit. 
</P>
<P>
A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman described as irresponsible "U.S. official 
remarks" made Tuesday and expressed surprise and "deep regret," the official 
New China News Agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese police officers physically blocked astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, China's 
most prominent advocate of democracy, from attending the Sunday night banquet 
given by Bush. The next day, Bush expressed regret about the police action, and 
Chinese officials said they resented the invitation to Fang. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy, rather than settling down, heated up after White House 
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater defended Bush against charges that he had failed to 
press human rights issues strongly enough while in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said Bush's banquet invitation to Fang and a few other critics of the 
government had been intended to make a human rights statement. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose the proof is in the pudding," Fitzwater said, "in the sense that 
China today is saying the United States is to blame for the diplomatic row, 
which is true . . . which is to say that the President invited dissidents to 
this banquet for a reason." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said Tuesday that the Chinese "may have a point" in contending that the 
flap might have been avoided if the United States had cleared the guest list 
with Chinese authorities. But he said he does not believe that he should have 
sought such approval. "I think they understand that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Foreign Ministry, without specifying which remarks had provoked its 
anger, responded sharply Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees Disrespect 
</P>
<P>
"Before the banquet, without consulting with the Chinese side, the U.S. side 
sent an invitation, bypassing the normal channel, to a certain individual 
unacceptable to the Chinese side," a Foreign Ministry spokesman said, according 
to the New China News Agency report. "This act of imposing one's own will on 
others can only be interpreted as support to this kind of people and disrespect 
for the host country. . . . We are surprised at the irresponsible remarks it 
(the United States) has made now, and express our deep regret." 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Fang, 52, has led a campaign seeking amnesty for political 
prisoners, especially Wei Jingsheng, a pro-democracy activist who has served 10 
years of a 15-year sentence for producing wallposters deemed 
counterrevolutionary and reactionary. 
</P>
<P>
Wei is China's most famous political prisoner, and Fang had expressed hope that 
Bush would raise his case with the Chinese leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Fang launched his amnesty appeal with a January letter to senior leader Deng 
Xiaoping. Then, in a rare display of coordinated political activism in a 
society where dissent is still dangerous, 33 prominent Chinese writers, 
scholars and editors signed an open letter last month supporting Fang's plea. 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, a Ministry of Justice spokesman sharply criticized signers of 
the supporting letter. He charged, according to the New China News Agency, that 
"it is against China's legal principles . . . to stir up public opinion in an 
attempt to overturn independent jurisdiction (of the courts) by soliciting 
signatures." 
</P>
<P>
Fang said Wednesday evening that he has not been contacted by U.S. officials or 
Chinese authorities since Sunday's incident. 
</P>
<P>
Told that a U.S. official had said that the banquet invitation was intended as 
a human rights statement, Fang said: "I think this is a good beginning. It 
shows they are beginning to take the same standard toward human rights in China 
as in the Soviet Union. It's only a beginning." 
</P>
<P>
Since the Sunday incident, he has received many telephone calls "from friends 
afraid I would get in more trouble," Fang said, "but right now I am still 
safe."

BUT DRUG CZAR-NOMINEE BRISTLES AT GIVING UP 'BULLY PULPIT'; 
</P>
<P>
BENNETT VOWS TO BE LESS A PHILOSOPHER 
</P>

<P>
Drug czar-designate William J. Bennett, under fire for his past outspokenness, 
reluctantly agreed before a Senate committee Wednesday to be "less the 
philosopher and more the administrator" in the war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The grudging pledge came amid Democratic criticism of Bennett's past statements 
on a wide range of subjects and the disclosure that as education secretary last 
year he drafted a memo calling on the Ronald Reagan Administration to give 
leadership of drug interdiction efforts to the military. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you think you can restrain yourself?" asked Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum 
(D-Ohio). ". . . You've been a real loose cannon at times." 
</P>
<P>
"That's fair enough," Bennett conceded. But he bristled at what he 
sarcastically described as the notion that "I ought to disassemble my bully 
pulpit, put on my green eyeshade and run numbers for a couple years." 
</P>
<P>
"Why take the job if you're just going to be a figurehead?" Bennett said. "The 
pay is horrible, the hours are long and the subject is depressing." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Bennett's agreement to cut a narrower swath than he had in the 
education department, both Metzenbaum and Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) nevertheless 
indicated that they might oppose Bennett's nomination on grounds that his lack 
of diplomacy threatened the bipartisanship and inter-agency cooperation they 
said was vital in the anti-drug effort. 
</P>
<P>
There was no sign that any of their colleagues on the Senate Judiciary 
Committee, which is holding the confirmation hearings on the post, would join 
them in opposition; indeed, a number of senators praised Bennett for being what 
Sen. Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.) called "no Walter Wallflower." 
</P>
<P>
But the sometimes-contentious tenor of the hearing appeared to foreshadow 
further conflict between the Congress and the blunt-speaking future drug czar 
on what Committee Chairman Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) described as "our 
dominant domestic concern." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, who has been directed by Congress to develop a comprehensive anti-drug 
strategy within 180 days of taking office, steadfastly refused Wednesday to 
provide an early indication of the approach he was likely to favor. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to give my recommendations and then conduct my study," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But, playing with a plastic policeman toy given to him by his son for the 
occasion, Bennett challenged those who had expressed pessimism about prospects 
for curbing drug use. "It's way too soon to say (the drug war) is over, we 
lost, because we haven't really waged it yet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While Bennett said he supported some drug education initiatives and believed 
that they worked, he indicated he believed many drug users are "lost causes." 
Citing Los Angeles street gangs as an example, he said: "It's been said there's 
no point in preaching to the choir. It may be that there's no point in 
preaching to the Bloods and the Crips." 
</P>
<P>
The debate about Bennett's views on the military's role in the anti-drug effort 
surfaced when Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), produced a copy of a memorandum 
the nominee sent last March 18 to then-Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III. In an 
underlined passage, it declared: "It is time to give the military the mission 
of leading" the drug interdiction effort. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that Pentagon officials had shown no appetite for the role, Bennett said 
in a later memo: "They have been burned and want to avoid a clear and 
open-ended responsibility that could get them burned again. Nevertheless, we 
must do more . . . on the supply side using military resources." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett refused to say whether he still shared that view, curtly telling 
Kennedy: "I'll let you know in six months." 
</P>
<P>
Metzenbaum's ire was raised when Bennett, whose top advisers are white males, 
responded brusquely when challenged about his commitment to include members of 
minority groups in top levels of his new anti-drug office, the Office of 
National Drug Control Policy. 
</P>
<P>
In a heated exchange, Bennett said he was aware of the need to demonstrate 
"sensitivity" to the minority groups most affected by the drug plague but 
steadfastly refused to promise specifically that he would hire minorities.

DEMOCRATS APPEAR TO RALLY 'ROUND NUNN

<P>
Senate Democrats appeared Wednesday to be rallying around Armed Services 
Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) in the wake of Republican attacks on his 
fairness and a newspaper report of a drunken driving incident he was involved 
in 24 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The attacks on Nunn escalated Tuesday when the Wall Street Journal editorial 
page took the unusual step of reprinting a 1972 article from the Atlanta 
Journal on the automobile accident. 
</P>
<P>
White House lobbyists conceded that Democrats' reaction to the attacks appeared 
to dim still further John Tower's chances of being confirmed as defense 
secretary. Many Democrats, they said, now seem to feel that any support for 
Tower would be viewed as implied criticism of the respected and popular 
committee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lawyer at the Time 
</P>
<P>
According to the article, Nunn, then a 26-year-old lawyer, hit a parked and 
unoccupied car, then drove into a ditch on his way home from a late-night 
Halloween party in 1964. He later paid a fine for leaving the scene of an 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal accompanied the reprint with an editorial denouncing 
Nunn and the Senate Democrats for using ethics as a political weapon in the 
fight over the Tower confirmation. Nunn later in the day issued a statement 
saying that he had been under the influence of alcohol at the time and that the 
incident "taught me a lesson" he said he had never forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
The episode may be more damaging now to Tower than to Nunn. Because it had 
previously been reported in Georgia, the fact that it has been reported again 
does not seem likely to affect his political fortunes there. In the Senate, the 
story seems to have caused some sympathy for Nunn and no sign of any reduction 
in his influence. 
</P>
<P>
Tower supporters had been circulating the story about Nunn's accident to other 
news organizations, including The Times, for more than a week prior to the 
Journal's reprinting of the Atlanta article. Robert L. Bartley, editor of the 
Journal's editorial page, declined Wednesday night to discuss whether the 
Journal's decision to reprint the article had been sought by Tower supporters. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Journal story, Senate Republicans Tuesday and Wednesday made 
a series of statements criticizing the nomination process that Nunn presided 
over. Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), for example, called the process 
a "hatchet job" and said that Tower had been "shabbily treated." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he was directly accusing Nunn of being unfair, Dole called him 
"partisan" and added: "The facts are going to indicate what his motives are." 
</P>
<P>
Nunn publicly dismissed the attacks. "This is hardball," Nunn said in an 
interview late Tuesday with a Georgia radio station. "I suppose when you're in 
the hardball game you get bruised." 
</P>
<P>
But a senior White House adviser, saying the attacks had seemed to increase 
Nunn's determination to defeat the nomination, conceded that the strategy was 
likely to backfire. He insisted, however, that Administration officials had not 
inspired the attacks although, he said, "we can't control the actions of 
others." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Democrats Praise Nunn 
</P>
<P>
Nunn's Democratic colleagues, meanwhile, went out of their way to praise Nunn 
in their comments on the Tower nomination Wednesday. Senate Majority Leader 
George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), for example, referred to him as "one of the most 
respected, if not the most respected, members of the Senate."

TIP TO S. KOREAN 'STUPID,' DERWINSKI TESTIFIES 
</P>

Veterans Secretary-designate Edward J. Derwinski on Wednesday described as 
"rather stupid" his tipping off a South Korean political minister that a Korean 
CIA official was defecting to U.S. authorities, but told a Senate committee he 
did so without "malicious" intent. 
</P>
<P>
Derwinski, testifying in detail publicly for the first time about the 1977 
incident, appeared certain to win approval by the Senate Veterans Affairs 
Committee when it votes today on his nomination. But the panel's hearing 
disclosed that conflicts exist between Derwinski's current explanation of the 
incident and what he told FBI agents about it after it occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Frank H. Murkowski (R-Alaska), the committee's ranking minority member, 
made the sharpest reference to the conflict in citing Derwinski's "seeming lack 
of directness" about the incident. Further, he advised him to tape record his 
answers the next time he talks to FBI agents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees 'Nothing Malicious' 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) seemed to be speaking for most committee members 
in telling Derwinski there was "nothing malicious or intentional to what you 
did." 
</P>
<P>
Specter said he had concluded that the tip to the South Korean official, "when 
contrasted with your long and otherwise unblemished, distinguished record" as a 
12-term congressman and then State Department official, should not stand as a 
barrier to confirmation as the nation's first secretary of veterans affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by Specter and Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), committee 
chairman, Derwinski said he still does not think his conversation with the 
South Korean official "endangered anyone . . . or obstructed justice in any 
way." He said he did not know the name of the defecting intelligence agent, his 
rank or location. 
</P>
<P>
Federal sources familiar with the incident, however, say that the defector and 
his family could have been harmed if the FBI had not escorted them to safety 
only half an hour before Korean CIA agents arrived at his home in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the incident, Derwinski was ranking Republican on a House 
subcommittee that was looking into allegations of influence peddling by South 
Korean agents. The subcommittee had opposed the so-called Koreagate 
investigation as damaging to U.S. security interests in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
In written responses to questions by Cranston and in testimony Wednesday, 
Derwinski said he mentioned the impending defection to the Korean Embassy 
official when he ran into him in front of a House office building. 
</P>
<P>
He said he told the South Korean official, whose name he could not recall, that 
there was going to be "the added PR problem of the subcommittee's receiving 
testimony" from a defector. 
</P>
<P>
Derwinski said he was speaking to the official, whom he described as "political 
minister at the embassy," in the "supercharged atmosphere involving anything 
Korean" and that in hindsight he should have never made the comment. 
</P>
<P>
Derwinski's tip became known to federal authorities through electronic 
monitoring of the South Korean Embassy that picked up a reference to his 
conversation with the Korean official, a source familiar with the matter said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conducts Closed Session 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the security surrounding that monitoring and related classified 
matters, the Senate committee questioned Derwinski for 90 minutes Tuesday in a 
closed session held in a special "bug proof" room in the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's testimony confirmed that Derwinski's account of the incident now 
and the one he had given earlier to the FBI differed in some respects. However, 
those conflicts were not aired at the hearing and the nature of them could not 
be learned. 
</P>
<P>
Derwinski sidestepped a question by Cranston on whether his leak had prompted 
intelligence agencies to refuse for six months to give the House subcommittee 
any more sensitive information for its probe. 
</P>
<P>
Derwinski said he recalled working "to obtain a better flow of information 
relevant to the subcommittee's investigation from federal agencies." 
</P>
<P>
The hearing disclosed that Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh declined to support a 
committee request for information from a federal grand jury that investigated 
the defector warning. The grand jury ended its inquiry without action on 
grounds that such action could reveal sensitive sources and intelligence 
methods. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by Cranston, however, Derwinski said he had declined to 
answer the grand jury's questions in 1977, citing the Constitution's "speech 
and debate" clause as grounds for his refusal. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston noted that a subsequent decision of the Supreme Court had narrowed use 
of that clause, which protects federal legislators from being held legally 
accountable for matters in connection with their speech or debate, and that it 
would no longer cover Derwinski's refusal to testify. 
</P>
<P>
Derwinski said it was not his "decision or strategy" not to testify, but that 
he had done so on the advice of his counsel, Thomas A. Kennelly.

Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) said Wednesday that he does not 
believe there are now enough votes in the Assembly to pass legislation 
outlawing military-style assault weapons, but he said advocates of the ban are 
closing in on the needed support. 
</P>
<P>
In a Capitol news conference, Brown said he hopes the Legislature will vote on 
the weapons bill before its Easter recess March 16. 
</P>
<P>
The Speaker said he has polled 60 of the 80 members of the Assembly and found 
38 "sure" votes for the Assembly's version of the gun bill, only three short of 
the 41-vote majority needed. Even so, Brown declared that he is "not absolutely 
certain" of having enough votes once the bill actually gets to the Assembly 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
Before the bill can go to the full house, it must be approved by the Assembly 
Ways and Means Committee, a hurdle Brown said he is confident it will clear.

KONRAD LORENZ; AUSTRIAN SCIENTIST WHO WON NOBEL

<TEXT>
<P>
Konrad Lorenz, the Austrian scientist who won a Nobel Prize for his pioneering 
studies of human and animal behavior that led to theories of man's innate 
aggressiveness, has died at age 85. 
</P>
<P>
The Austrian Academy of Sciences said Tuesday that Lorenz died Monday night at 
his home at Altenburg, about 30 miles northeast of Vienna. The Austria Press 
Agency said he died of kidney failure. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenz, considered Austria's most famous scientist, years ago could be found 
paddling in his swimming trunks among a flock of greylag geese, his favorite 
research objects. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to understand geese, you have to live with them," he would 
explain. 
</P>
<P>
He used to say the research into animal behavior that won him the Nobel Prize 
for medicine or physiology in 1973 started when he was 5, as he quacked his way 
to a relationship with a duck he had raised. 
</P>
<P>
"It was this contact which created the soil on which all my work has grown," 
said the white-haired, bearded bird lover, who gained a reputation for 
unconventional research methods and who held doctorates in medicine, zoology 
and psychology. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenz turned to research in animal behavior shortly after obtaining his 
medical degree. He had become an animal lover as a child, collecting a variety 
of pets at his expansive boyhood home outside Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 200 jackdaws, hawks, ravens, cormorants, storks and other wild birds also 
frequented the home where Lorenz returned in his old age. 
</P>
<P>
His first important findings concerned the social life of birds. Those studies 
convinced him that many aspects of bird behavior were innate and instinctive, 
rather than learned. 
</P>
<P>
His views were controversial, and they became even more so when he suggested 
that such instinctive behavior might be important in humans, too. 
</P>
<P>
One of his best-known findings was that young animals will become strongly 
attached to their biological mothers, a process known as imprinting. 
</P>
<P>
He showed that the process could be altered, however, by demonstrating that 
mallard ducklings would happily follow a human who greeted them shortly after 
birth and imitated a mother's quacking. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenz's theory of comparative ethology -- the study of animal and human 
behavior through comparative zoological methods -- linked him to the ideas of 
Charles Darwin. 
</P>
<P>
Like Darwin, he held that physical characteristics of species and hereditary 
behavior stem from trying to adjust to their surroundings to boost chances of 
the species' survival. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Vienna, the son of a surgeon, Lorenz was awarded his first doctorate in 
medicine at age 25. Further studies in zoology and psychology followed in 
Vienna and New York, culminating in a 1933 doctorate based on his research on 
the behavior of birds. 
</P>
<P>
In 1939, Lorenz was given a chair in psychology at the prestigious Immanuel 
Kant University in Koenigsberg, then a German town and today the Soviet port of 
Kaliningrad. 
</P>
<P>
His tenure there and publications during that time led in later years to 
allegations that Lorenz was a Nazi sympathizer. 
</P>
<P>
When accepting the Nobel Prize, which he shared with Karl von Frisch and 
Nikolaas Tinbergen, he apologized for a 1940 publication judged to reflect Nazi 
views of science, saying that "many highly decent scientists hoped, like I did, 
for a short time for good from National Socialism, and many quickly turned away 
from it with the same horror as I."

BROWN AGAIN TOPS LEGISLATORS WITH OUTSIDE INCOME OF $100,000-PLUS

<P>
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) reported on Wednesday that he 
collected more than $100,000 in speaking fees, gifts and travel expenses last 
year, largely from special-interest groups pushing bills in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's report of outside income -- far short of his record-setting total of 
$161,000 in 1987 -- was part of an avalanche of financial disclosure statements 
filed with the state Fair Political Practices Commission before a Wednesday 
midnight postmark deadline. 
</P>
<P>
The reports, which will continue to arrive over the next few days, illustrated 
anew the common practice among legislators of accepting fees, gifts and foreign 
trips from many organizations that seek to influence legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Among others filing Wednesday was Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti 
(D-Los Angeles), who reported a total of $66,178 in gifts and honorariums in 
1988, including $49,578 in speaking fees and $12,081 for trips to Taiwan, 
Germany and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Last January, Roberti received $3,000 for a speech from the California 
Retailers Assn., a group that successfully pushed for passage of a 
controversial bill that lifted the limit on interest rates that department 
stores are allowed to charge their credit card customers. The organization paid 
$16,000 to key lawmakers for speeches in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian reported receiving gifts totaling $7,459 and said he had 
no income from speeches. The governor received $2,500 in gold medallions from 
Armenian supporters, three Super Bowl tickets worth $450 from Alex Spanos, 
owner of the San Diego Chargers, and a painting of a Chinese dragon valued at 
$1,000 from the Charity Cultural Services Center of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, talking to reporters, said his speaking fees declined in 1988 because of 
time spent on a yearlong fight with the dissident Democratic "Gang of Five," 
who unsuccessfully tried to oust him as Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
He said he continues to support a proposal to ban outside income for 
legislators, but only if their pay is raised from $40,816 a year to a Superior 
Court judge's salary of $84,765. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the $89,600 he received last year for 49 speeches and $10,698 in 
gifts and travel expenses, Brown reported income of more than $10,000 from his 
law practice. (Under state law, lawmakers must report exact amounts of gifts 
and honorariums, but other sources of outside income need only be revealed by 
monetary category, with "over $10,000" the highest amount.) 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any problems at all giving up outside income totally," Brown 
said, "but there has to be an adequate salary." 
</P>
<P>
Brown also defended public officials who accept speaking fees and travel 
expenses from special-interest groups that lobby for legislation. "It may look 
like vote-buying, but it really doesn't have anything to do with vote-buying," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
As for lawmakers who accept fees without giving speeches -- for simply 
attending a reception or seminar, for example -- Brown said, "It's a dumb thing 
to do, real dumb. There's no accounting for the fact that some of us are dumb. 
Some of us permanently." 
</P>
<P>
Brown complained that a $1,000-a-year limitation on gifts and speaking fees 
that went into effect in January, after passage of last year's Proposition 73, 
will have a dramatic effect on his speech-making. "It's burdensome in that I'll 
end up making three to four times the number of speeches," he said, "and that's 
time-consuming." 
</P>
<P>
A number of legislative leaders appeared to be in high demand as public 
speakers in 1988, including Assemblyman Pat Nolan of Glendale, who stepped down 
from his post as Assembly Republican leader in December. He was one of four 
lawmakers whose offices were searched by the FBI as part of its undercover 
Capitol corruption probe. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan reported receiving $24,750 for delivering speeches and serving as a 
panelist at conventions. His largest speaking fee -- $3,000 -- came from the 
California Retailers. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno reported a $2,000 speaking fee 
from the retailers group among $12,250 in honorariums he received in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Several elected state officials reported receiving foreign trips, including 
Bill Honig, state superintendent of public instruction, who was given a $13,372 
trip to Japan to visit educational institutions. The trip was paid for by the 
Japanese government. 
</P>
<P>
Brown was given $2,000 for delivering a speech to the Italian parliament. 
</P>
<P>
State Board of Equalization member Paul B. Carpenter, one of the subjects of 
the FBI investigation into Capitol political corruption, reported a $9,116 trip 
to Europe in February, 1988, during which he also received $3,311 for 
delivering speeches in Dublin, London and Madrid. 
</P>
<P>
Another target of the FBI sting, Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier), for the 
first time officially reported receiving $3,000 on June 29 of last year from 
Peachstate Capital, a phony company set up by FBI agents as part of their 
undercover investigation. The money was delivered at a breakfast meeting in a 
restaurant a block from the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya's financial disclosure statement showed that he collected $36,550 in 
honorariums during 1988, the largest being $5,000 from the California Medical 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The senator has also disclosed that he failed to report an $8,000 personal 
consulting fee he received in 1987 from Tony Olguin, a City of Industry builder 
and developer. The amount should have been included on the financial statement 
Montoya filed a year ago, but he said in a letter to the FPPC in December that 
the omission was "inadvertent and certainly unintentional."

STALKER CASE ATTORNEY'S BID FOR MORE TIME OFF REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An unsympathetic Los Angeles Superior Court judge Wednesday ordered the Night 
Stalker trial to resume on Monday, denying defense lawyer Daniel V. Hernandez's 
request for several weeks off to recuperate from nervous exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Michael A. Tynan said it is not unusual for lawyers and judges to find a 
death penalty case stressful. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us have chest pains, some of us have bellyaches, but the point is that 
we all suffer stress in these cases," Tynan said, adding pointedly: "Some do it 
(react) better than others." 
</P>
<P>
Tynan said he could find "no legal cause" to further delay the case. 
</P>
<P>
The judge, who has presided over the serial-murder trial since it began Jan. 
30, also ordered a second defense lawyer, Arturo Hernandez, to begin appearing 
in court, starting next week. Arturo Hernandez, 35, has rarely appeared in 
court since jury selection commenced in July. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the courtroom afterward, Daniel Hernandez called Tynan's order 
"unbelievable," but he said he would comply, as did Arturo Hernandez. The two 
San Jose-based attorneys are not related. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Daniel Hernandez's physician in San Jose sent Tynan a letter saying 
that Hernandez was "not presently capable of functioning as a trial attorney" 
and that he needed four to six weeks off. 
</P>
<P>
The general-practice physician, who was not publicly identified, said Hernandez 
has complained of late-night perspiration, heartburn, numbness in the hands, 
shortness of breath, chest pains and dizziness. But the only objective finding 
during a full physical examination was moderately elevated blood sugar levels, 
according to the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez pleaded in court Wednesday for two to three weeks off. He said the 
time would allow him to recuperate and begin a diet and exercise regimen under 
the supervision of a stress therapist. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, 44, also said he would use that time to continue searching for an 
additional attorney to help defend accused Night Stalker Richard Ramirez. Since 
summer, Hernandez has met with numerous private defense lawyers in Northern and 
Southern California, seeking their participation in the trial, but to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
When Hernandez finished, lead prosecutor Phil Halpin, who has fought against 
any delay in the trial, told Tynan: "I'd like to have a month off on the 
Riviera myself." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Causing Anguish 
</P>
<P>
Halpin noted that the prospect of a lengthy delay -- and possibly a mistrial -- 
have caused numerous witnesses and surviving Night Stalker victims to call him 
in anguish. 
</P>
<P>
"People are getting pretty disgusted," said the Los Angeles County deputy 
district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps no less so than the court," Tynan replied. 
</P>
<P>
The judge noted that Hernandez already has had two weeks off because of his 
condition. "I wish you well in San Jose," Tynan said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Tynan's rulings on Wednesday, Halpin said outside court that he remains 
concerned about a relapse by Hernandez. "I believe it's going to happen again," 
the prosecutor said. Until the trial is over, Halpin added, "the potential of a 
mistrial will remain with us." 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez, a 29-year-old drifter from El Paso, Tex., is charged with 13 murders 
and 30 other felonies in a terrifying spree of night-time residential attacks 
in 1984-85. If convicted, he could receive the death penalty.

 4 PARAMEDICS SUE OVER WEIGHT RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four paramedics who have been suspended from the Los Angeles Fire Department 
for being too plump sued the city Wednesday, claiming the weight requirements 
violate their civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
The four and their union, the United Paramedics of Los Angeles, contend in 
their U.S. District Court suit that the Fire Department's maximum weights are 
arbitrary and capricious and bear no relation to their ability to do their 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The paramedics, Kathleen Hegwer, James Just, Douglas McMillen and James 
Schilling, have not lost their jobs, their attorney, Diane Marchant said, but 
they have either been suspended without pay or ordered suspended for periods 
ranging from four to 60 days for violating the weight standards. 
</P>
<P>
The paramedics seek a court order halting enforcement of the regulations plus 
$10,000 each in damages. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, the Fire Department just doesn't like the look of people who are 
overweight," Marchant said. "It's an invasion of privacy. A person is entitled 
to have some autonomy over their own body unless the government has some 
compelling interest in what you look like." 
</P>

MAN GOES ON TRIAL IN DEATH OF HIS BRIDE ON HONEYMOON CRUISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a bright Saturday afternoon in February, the sun suspended over a glassy 
sea, when Coast Guard searchers spotted two tiny points of white bobbing in the 
water off the coast of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The cutter moved in closer, and the two spots became the toes of Karen Waltz 
Roston's tennis shoes, floating in the still Pacific above her bruised and 
bloodied face -- the first concrete indication that Roston's honeymoon cruise 
to Mexico might not have ended as her new husband had said. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Roston had told the cruise ship's captain that his 26-year-old wife had 
tumbled overboard the night before in a stiff wind. The bruises on her forehead 
and neck belied that explanation even at first glance. So did the puncture 
wound in her abdomen. Coast Guard Lt. Jeff Lee said even his seasoned rescue 
team was disturbed by its cargo as they headed back for port. 
</P>
<P>
"I directed the chief to say a prayer on the Bible, to kind of calm everybody 
down," Lee testified Wednesday on the opening day of Scott Roston's trial on 
charges of second-degree murder on the high seas. 
</P>
<P>
Roston's lawyer, David Kenner, told a federal court jury in Los Angeles that 
Roston was afraid to tell investigators initially that his wife had apparently 
been murdered by Israeli agents -- agents who had first drugged him into 
unconsciousness -- in retribution for a book he had written about Israeli human 
rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no motive or reason or rationale for Dr. Roston to take the life of 
the woman he had wanted so long to marry," Kenner said in his opening 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
But Assistant U.S. Atty. Kendra McNally sketched a picture of a honeymoon gone 
awry, of a bridegroom annoyed by his wife's lack of social sophistication and 
her propensity for sweets and of a bride constantly afraid of annoying her new 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
McNally said that after "a fight" about an hour earlier, Roston accompanied his 
wife to a jogging track on the upper-level deck of the ship and began 
strangling her. 
</P>
<P>
"The force of his hands on her throat was enough to cause bleeding in all the 
muscles of her neck, but it did not kill her so he lifted her, still breathing, 
still alive, over a 3 1/2-foot wall and dropped her into the dark, quiet sea 
where she drowned," the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica Chiropractor 
</P>
<P>
Roston, a 27-year-old Santa Monica chiropractor, walked to the table tennis 
room two decks below and told a trio of musicians that his wife had just been 
blown overboard by strong winds. He explained the scratches on his face by 
saying he had run into a piece of equipment when he had turned in response to 
her cries for help. 
</P>
<P>
But McNally said the ship's captain will testify that Roston asked to use a 
bathroom immediately after being asked about the scratches, then was seen to 
examine his face in a mirror, wash it and leave the bathroom without ever using 
the other facilities. 
</P>
<P>
After he was arrested, Roston asserted that Israeli agents had been following 
him and harassing him since he wrote a book about "atrocities" in Israel, 
"Nightmare in Israel," and had drugged him and apparently murdered his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Kenner said there is evidence, in fact, that two Israeli nationals were aboard 
the Stardancer during the cruise, but both have since returned to Israel and 
cannot be subpoenaed to testify at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of what happened to him in Israel, he was afraid, in fact, for his own 
life while still on that ship, to discuss and to reveal his recollection of 
what occurred on that ship and his belief as to why," Kenner said, admitting 
the allegations may appear "unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
"But these kinds of events do happen in the world of international intrigue," 
he told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Witnesses Shared Table 
</P>
<P>
Among the first witnesses were two passengers who were assigned to the Rostons' 
table in the ship's dining room, an Oregon homemaker and her daughter from 
Seattle, who testified that Roston frequently seemed irritated when his wife 
would show up late for dinner or, on another occasion, expressed confusion at 
the array of silverware on the table for a formal dinner. 
</P>
<P>
"He seemed embarrassed and more or less perturbed that she would admit she 
didn't know all these different silverware," Carol Abramson testified. "At 
times his eyes would flash at her, and right away she would drop her eyes and 
then hardly say anything." 
</P>
<P>
Abramson's daughter, Peggy Thompson, said Roston once made a "startling" 
statement during dinner about his work as a chiropractor. 
</P>
<P>
"He mentioned that one of the things he liked about being a chiropractor was 
the sense of power it gave you," she said. "When he had the person in a 
position that he could either cure them or he could do great harm to them." 
</P>
<P>
Roston, if convicted on the second-degree murder charge, could face up to life 
in prison. The trial before U.S. District Judge James M. Ideman is expected to 
last three weeks.

 4 RESERVOIRS PICKED FOR HISTORIC STATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission has declared the Silver Lake, 
Ivanhoe and Upper and Lower Hollywood reservoirs cultural historic monuments. 
The designation, which must be ratified by the City Council, was requested by 
Councilman Michael Woo in an attempt to protect the reservoirs from city 
Department of Water and Power plans to cover Ivanhoe and Upper Hollywood, while 
constructing filtration plants for Silver Lake and Lower Hollywood. Nearby 
residents object to the plans. 
</P>
<P>
"Much of the history of Los Angeles is tied in with water and these reservoirs 
were among the originals," Woo said. Duane Georgeson, the utility's assistant 
general manager, said the reservoirs could still be covered if necessary to 
meet federal water standards. But Woo said monument status could delay 
construction for up to a year while more aesthetic alternatives were 
considered. The Silver Lake and Ivanhoe reservoirs were built in 1906. Lower 
Hollywood was built in 1924 and Upper Hollywood in 1933.

 SANTA MONICA BANS ASSAULT WEAPONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Monica has joined the growing list of California cities banning assault 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Citing "unprecedented episodes of violence," the City Council voted unanimously 
late Tuesday night to outlaw the sale of semiautomatic assault rifles, 
effective immediately. Possession of the firearms is banned starting May 1. 
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen gun enthusiasts, members of the National Rifle Assn. and gun 
shop owners protested the law, saying it was unconstitutional and wouldn't 
work. They complained the definition of assault rifles is too broad and said 
the ban would take away "legitimate" weapons from hunters. 
</P>
<P>
But council members were unswayed. Councilman David Finkel, who called assault 
rifles the "scourge of the country," said he hoped Santa Monica's action would 
encourage the state Legislature to enact a ban. Santa Monica modeled its law 
after a Los Angeles ordinance that took effect Wednesday, defining an assault 
weapon as a rifle that can be outfitted with a detachable magazine that holds 
at least 20 rounds of ammunition.

THIRD GANG MEMBER IN SLAYING OF GIRL SEIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARISSE JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A third teen-age gang member was arrested Wednesday in the drive-by shooting 
death of an 11-year-old girl, who was gunned down last weekend as she walked 
into the middle of two gangs warring over territory in the Pico-Union area, Los 
Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old suspect, a member of a gang of Central American youths believed 
responsible for numerous drive-by shootings in the area, was booked for 
investigation of murder in the death of Jasmine Guevara, Rampart Division 
Detective Art Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
He was detained at Eastlake Juvenile Hall, along with two fellow gang members 
arrested earlier in the week in the shooting. Officials would not release the 
names of the suspects because of their ages, nor would they provide the name of 
their gang. 
</P>
<P>
Police had been seeking the third youth for two days when they received a tip 
Wednesday about his whereabouts, Castro said. The detective would not elaborate 
on the information police were given. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jumped Over Fences 
</P>
<P>
When officers spotted the gang member standing in front of a home on West 17th 
Street in the Pico-Union area, the teen-ager ran, "jumping over some fences" in 
an attempt to evade arrest. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 officers were called in to surround a two-block area and search for 
the youth, Castro said. But it was a police dog that found the teen-ager hiding 
under a house a few doors away from where police first saw him. 
</P>
<P>
"He was found underneath a residence in the 1300 block of West 17th Street," 
Castro said, adding that the youth was not armed. 
</P>
<P>
Castro would not say if the gang member arrested Wednesday was one of the two 
triggermen in the slaying. Police were seeking a fourth gang member in the 
shooting, which occurred last Saturday night when Jasmine, her 14-year-old 
sister, Melda, and an aunt, Blanca Guevara, 42, were walking home from a 
neighborhood liquor store. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-year-old and her aunt were hit by shotgun blasts, apprently intended for 
gang members who were standing nearby. The child was killed instantly. Her aunt 
was in serious condition, but improving Wednesday at County- USC Medical 
Center, according to a hospital spokeswoman. Melda was not hurt.

STATE SCRAMBLING TO RETAIN U.S. FUNDING OF AMNESTY PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH GETLIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Members of Congress and California officials launched a battle Wednesday 
against proposed federal budget cuts that could slash $348 million from state 
programs offering health care and English language skills to persons seeking 
amnesty under the new immigration law. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles would be the biggest loser of any city in the nation under the 
cutbacks, which state officials said could overwhelm an already strained local 
health-care system and prevent large numbers of illegal aliens from gaining the 
skills needed for permanent residency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Unconscionable Proposal' 
</P>
<P>
"This is an unconscionable proposal. . . . It would be a major breach of faith 
by the federal government," Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) said of the 
Bush Administration move to rescind $600 million in funds that have already 
been appropriated. "We in the California delegation will be fighting very hard 
to hold onto that money." 
</P>
<P>
More than 58% of the threatened immigration funds had been earmarked for 
California, and state lobbyists spent a hectic day trying to persuade officials 
at the Department of Health and Human Services that the proposed cuts would 
take too heavy a toll. 
</P>
<P>
But the battle does not end there. Advocates also expressed concern about 
legislation introduced Wednesday by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) that would 
take an additional $200 million from the same pool of immigration funds and use 
it to provide emergency assistance for 25,000 Soviet Jews and other refugees 
awaiting entry to this country. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the Kennedy proposal could cost California $115 million more in 
immigration funds, according to Mark S. Helmar, assistant secretary for the 
state's Health and Welfare Agency. Most of the state cuts would fall on Los 
Angeles County, which has an estimated 25% of the nation's population of 
eligible aliens seeking amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Robbing Peter to Pay Paul' 
</P>
<P>
"That's like robbing Peter to pay Paul," said a House aide familiar with 
immigration issues. "There's no reason why the interests of Latinos in 
California and Soviet Jews have to collide. There should be some way to deal 
with both issues and not hurt anybody." 
</P>
<P>
The issue surfaced earlier this year when President Reagan's final budget 
recommended removing $600 million from the state legalization impact assistance 
grants program. Under the $4-billion, four-year program, which was created as 
part of the nation's immigration reform law, aliens seeking amnesty are 
guaranteed indigent health care and free instruction in special English 
language training classes. 
</P>
<P>
Administration budget officials determined this year, however, that states were 
not spending their share of the funds quickly and that large sums were piling 
up as surplus. They recommended that it be used to reduce the federal deficit 
or for other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
But Helmar and other advocates assert that California has not spent its full 
share of the immigration funds because federal officials have been slow to 
issue guidelines for the program. More important, they contend that the program 
was always expected to start slowly in its first two years and then gain speed 
in later years as the number of people qualifying for amnesty increased. 
</P>
<P>
That was the case in Los Angeles County where 266,957 persons had filed 
applications for amnesty as of October, 1987. As of December, 1988, the total 
had grown to more than 730,000, according to Mark Tajima, a county management 
analyst and immigration specialist. 
</P>
<P>
"We always knew this program would become more intensive in its later years, 
and that's what is happening here," he said. "If these cutbacks go through, 
they could have a devastating impact on Los Angeles, particularly in increased 
health-care costs that would normally have been paid for with federal funds." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Urgency to Be Stressed 
</P>
<P>
Helmar said he and other state officials will be meeting this week with members 
of the state's congressional delegation to stress the urgency of the issue. 
They will also be voicing concerns about the potential impact of the Kennedy 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
Under Kennedy's proposal, the government would raise the ceiling for Soviet 
emigres receiving refugee status from 25,000 to 50,000 this year. Kennedy said 
there is a "refugee emergency" developing for Soviet Jews because the U.S. 
government has been swamped with new applicants for entry and will run out of 
funds to process additional cases next month. 
</P>
<P>
Berman agreed that the government should provide new aid for Soviet emigres but 
not at the expense of amnesty programs that are crucial to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"I can only believe that Sen. Kennedy is not aware of why that (immigrant 
assistance) money has accumulated and how unfortunate it would be if that were 
suddenly depleted," he said. "We should find a way to accomplish both tasks, 
keeping both programs on track."

JURY CLEARS DETECTIVE IN DEATH OF WOMAN IN '83 HAWTHORNE DRUG RAID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NIESON HIMMEL and HECTOR TOBAR, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A jury ruled Wednesday that a Los Angeles police detective acted properly in 
the shooting of a woman who was killed as she emerged from a shower during a 
1983 drug raid in Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
The civil suit was filed in Torrance Superior Court by family members on behalf 
of Myron Ryan Jr., 14, who was 7 when his mother, Alice English, 28, was 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Ryan alleged that narcotics Detective Carl Ingels was guilty of 
wrongful death and negligence in the shooting of English during the October, 
1983, raid on the home of Michael Thurmond, English's boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
The Torrance Superior Court jury voted 12 to 0 in Ingels' favor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Feel Great' 
</P>
<P>
"I feel great," Ingels, 52, a 32-year veteran of the department, said after the 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
"I was acting in defense of my life," he added. "I was exonerated by a jury of 
12 people and by my department." 
</P>
<P>
Ingels was one of several officers involved in the pre-dawn raid. Los Angeles 
detectives, backed up by officers from Hawthorne and Inglewood, were serving a 
search warrant, acting on a tip that drugs were being sold at the home. 
Thurmond was also being sought for violation of parole after a robbery 
conviction in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Officers battered open a steel gate and the rear door at the single-story 
stucco house on West 116th Street when the occupants refused to let the police 
in, said Deputy Los Angeles City Atty. Richard James, who represented Ingels 
and the city, who were named as defendants in the 1984 suit. 
</P>
<P>
After entering the home, Ingels led a team of officers to the rear of the home 
and a locked bathroom. When the officers kicked down the door, Thurmond stayed 
in place, but English ran to the shower, James said. 
</P>
<P>
She emerged carrying a dark object and "lunged" at Ingels. The detective fired 
one shot at the woman, hitting her in the groin. Police determined later that 
the object was a dark bathrobe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cocaine Found 
</P>
<P>
English died 2 1/2 hours later at Hawthorne Community Hospital. Police said a 
large quantity of cocaine and a loaded automatic handgun were recovered in the 
three-bedroom house. Five men were arrested during the raid on suspicion of 
conspiracy to sell cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they had information that Thurmond and the others in the home would 
be heavily armed. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police investigators later found that the shooting of English was 
"justified by self-defense," James said. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, (Ingels) had 27 years on the department, 17 of them as a 
narcotics detective. It was only the second time he had fired a weapon in all 
of those years," James said. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Goodfriend, an attorney for Ryan, could not be reached Wednesday for 
comment.

FBI JOINS PROBE OF ATTACKS ON 2 BERKELEY BOOKSTORES

<P>
The FBI on Wednesday entered the investigation of two Berkeley bookstore 
firebombings that authorities said may have been prompted by Muslim outrage 
over Salman Rushdie's novel, "The Satanic Verses." 
</P>
<P>
An FBI spokesman in San Francisco said the agency stepped in on the grounds 
that the attacks violated the Hobbs Act, a federal law prohibiting violence or 
threats against interstate commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials had yet to hear from any person or group claiming 
responsibility for the Tuesday predawn Molotov cocktail bombings at Cody's book 
store and a Waldenbooks outlet, both on Telegraph Avenue near the University of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Open Mind' in Probe 
</P>
<P>
"We're approaching this with a real open mind," said FBI spokesman Chuck 
Latting. "It's real easy to assume this has something to do with the Rushdie 
book." He added, however, "At this time we have no real hard evidence." 
</P>
<P>
Cody's had maintained a high profile in the Rushdie furor, proclaiming on a 
window poster that it will not ban the book. After the Molotov cocktail attack, 
a pipe bomb also was found in the wreckage there. 
</P>
<P>
Latting said the crude nature of the devices, as well as the limited damage to 
both stores, made it unlikely that the blasts were the work of international 
terrorists. "It wouldn't have been so sloppily done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As dozens of FBI agents went door-to-door looking for witnesses, Berkeley 
Police Lt. Michel de Latour said his detectives had not yet turned up any 
suspects. "We have a few leads in the case," he said. "There are a few 
witnesses and that's all I have to add." 
</P>
<P>
Cody's remained closed for cleanup on Wednesday, but manager Nick Setka said he 
plans to reopen and "probably hire a security guard." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Open for Business 
</P>
<P>
Waldenbooks, where workmen replaced the shattered window and charred carpeting, 
carried on a normal business day. Security guards have been hired there and at 
another Berkeley Waldenbooks store. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the chain in Stamford, Conn., said the bombing had not changed 
its policy of allowing individual store managers to decide whether to sell "The 
Satanic Verses."

But, said Trace Urdan, "The chances are slim that it will ever be displayed in 
the windows." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Washington, a group of publishers and booksellers, fearing that 
bookstore bombings will continue, met with Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh and 
received his assurance that "every resource available" will be used to hunt 
down the bombers and guard against future attacks. 
</P>
<P>
In the meeting, which lasted more than an hour, 10 representatives of 
publishing houses and three representatives of booksellers expressed their 
concerns in the wake of Monday's firebombings. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh later told reporters: "There simply is no room for any threat 
against the exercise of First Amendment rights."

About 40 people forced from their homes by a freight train wreck were allowed 
to return early Wednesday, ending the second evacuation in two days, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Two tanker cars containing flammable butane caught fire Sunday and forced the 
evacuation of 2,000 people. As the train was being moved Tuesday, another 
tanker jumped the tracks, forcing the second evacuation.

SHOWERS FORECAST ON HEELS OF DISAPPOINTINGLY DRY FEBRUARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Showers are expected to be heavy at times today as a wet and unstable tropical 
air mass moves through Southern California, forecasters said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service concluded there was a 70% chance of rain today and 
a 30% chance of some parting showers Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Meteorologist Rick Dittmann of WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for 
The Times, said the Southland should "get its share" of the "big surge of 
tropical moisture" headed toward the coast from near Hawaii. He said some spots 
in the coastal mountains could get more than two inches of rain. 
</P>
<P>
The weather service foresaw rainfall amounts ranging up to half an inch in the 
northern coastal areas and up to .75 of an inch in the mountains, with snow 
above the 8,000-foot level today, lowering to 6,000 feet Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The subtropical mass was being drawn this way, Dittmann said, by a southern 
branch of the jet stream "skirting south and heading straight for California." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles high temperatures today should be in the low 60s, the weather 
service said. The Civic Center high on Wednesday was 62 degrees after an 
overnight low of 53. Relative humidity ranged from 81% to 58%. 
</P>
<P>
As March began, the weather service pointed out that February, "usually 
considered the heart of the rainy season," brought only 1.90 inches of rain to 
Los Angeles -- mostly between the 2nd and 9th. 
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday, the rainfall total for the season was 7.22 inches, compared to a 
normal of 11.16. Last year by March 1, the total was 8.99. 
</P>
<P>
Winter rains gradually decrease in March, the weather service said. The normal 
rainfall in the coastal and valley areas is two to three inches.

LET'S EAT OUT: STEPPING BACK IN TIME TO DINE AT THE SADDLEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was cold in Lake Arrowhead, with snow from a recent winter storm still piled 
up where plows had pushed it to clear roads and parking lots. Despite the short 
time it took to hustle from the car into the Saddleback Inn, the warm, cozy 
atmosphere was certainly welcome. 
</P>
<P>
This building was originally the Raven Hotel, constructed in 1917. The 
twenty-eight room, three-story English Tavern was the dream castle of two 
sisters from the Midwest. In the decades to follow, it played host to Howard 
Hughes, the Charles Lindberghs and numerous Hollywood celebrities. Now totally 
restored, it's been declared a historical landmark. 
</P>
<P>
On the far side of the Victorian-style lobby is the Saddleback Food &amp; 
Beverage Co., a bar and restaurant that serves inn guests but is also open to 
the public. We were ushered to a booth with swag drapes of dusty-rose velvet, 
trimmed with fringe. They complemented the floral carpet of multicolored roses 
against a green background. Gas light replicas cast a subtle glow over the 
room, that even with its lace and frills, is not overly obtrusive. 
</P>
<P>
The dinner menu is pseudo French-American, loaded with classic entrees like 
veal Oscar, veal Marsala, steak au poivre and shrimp scampi, along with 
linguine with clam sauce, broiled lobster tail, New York and filet mignon 
steaks and seafood Wellington. 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing trendy among the appetizer selections either, but care in 
preparation and up-to-date techniques saves this from being just old-fashioned 
food. Our order of fried zucchini had been cooked in fresh oil, heated to the 
correct temperature and wasn't the least bit greasy. Granted the dish began as 
a frozen product, but as a quality frozen product with a light batter that 
clung to the French fry-sized vegetable sticks. A serving ample enough to be 
shared was served piping hot with blue cheese and honey-mustard dipping sauces. 
</P>
<P>
Slightly thicker versions of the same sauces appeared as dressings for the 
dinner salad, included with entrees (an option to soup). Unfortunately, the 
croutons had not received the same care as the zucchini sticks and were overly 
greasy. Greens, however, were fresh and crisp, the cherry tomato was ripe and 
chilled forks added a nice touch. 
</P>
<P>
Pasta for the a la carte fettuccine Alfredo was cooked perfectly al dente and 
the cream sauce was rich, yet surprisingly light. A good example of a 
well-prepared classic. 
</P>
<P>
Service was friendly and our questions were answered honestly. The kitchen was 
consulted on what brand of frozen zucchini was used and there was no attempt to 
disguise which items were commercial and which were homemade. 
</P>
<P>
We learned all the restaurant's breads are made on the premises. The light 
wheat loaf served at dinner was very acceptable, but we were told the muffins 
available at weekend brunches should not to be missed. 
</P>
<P>
When it came to entrees, teriyaki steak, billed as a large New York steak 
"topped with our own special sauce," was another example of the chef's light 
hand. Their version is indeed special, not overly salty as is so often the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Veal Oscar was lightly breaded and sauteed. Asparagus was fresh, but the crab 
could have been fresher. The dilled carrots served with both entrees made a 
better accompaniment to the steak, conflicting with the veal's bearnaise sauce. 
</P>
<P>
There's a sizable wine list, predominantly domestic and several offerings by 
the glass. Another plus -- non-alcoholic wines are offered by both the glass 
and bottle. 
</P>
<P>
A dessert tray had three or four offerings, but none were too tempting to 
resist after learning they were not made in the restaurant. Probably a saving 
grace, calorie-wise, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Today the local mountains provide a weekend escape for far more than the rich 
and famous. However, with the main portion of Lake Arrowhead Village having 
been rebuilt in the last few years, the Saddleback Inn is one of the few places 
left in the area that offers an opportunity to step back in time and enjoy some 
favorite classics in a historical setting. 
</P>
<P>

DONATIONS OF LEFTOVER FOOD HIT A SNAG; 
</P>
<P>
HOTELS SAY HEALTH LAWS, INSURANCE PREVENT REDISTRIBUTION 
</P>

<P>
In a land of excess, Bryna Monsein thinks her story has particular relevance. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Bethesda, Md., resident decided to donate the leftovers from her 
daughter's wedding reception at downtown Washington's Mayflower Hotel to the 
Community for Creative Non-Violence, a homeless advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
"Wonderful food," she says. "Blackened sirloin, shrimp scampi, chicken piccata, 
wonderful pasta." 
</P>
<P>
But the Mayflower, fearing it would be liable if anyone became ill, refused. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really sad," she says. "To think of all that food going into the garbage 
was just pitiful." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Common Concerns 
</P>
<P>
But not unusual. A number of local hotels, citing health regulations, insurance 
and public relations concerns, refuse to redistribute food they haven't served. 
Still, caterers, who would presumably have the same concerns, have earned a 
reputation for being generous with their clients' extra food. 
</P>
<P>
"Somehow caterers have been more sensitized than hotels and restaurants," says 
Carol Fennelly of CCNV. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel managers say it is not a question of sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
"Once food is dispensed, at no time could it be given away," says Paul J. 
Sacco, general manager of the Omni Shoreham Hotel. "Health laws would dictate 
that you would not be able to reissue it." 
</P>
<P>
Sacco's opinion was echoed by other hotel managers, but, according to Sidney 
Hall, chief of food protection for the District of Columbia's Department of 
Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, "There are no such regulations." Hall says 
hotels can donate food to charity "so long as the food is wholesome and has not 
been used by former patrons." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reasoning May Not Hold 
</P>
<P>
But Kevin McPhee, director of food and beverages at the Mayflower, insists that 
the hotel is legally liable for the food it prepares. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not a question of donating food. We donate food. But donating food that 
has already been prepared for another purpose, that is another question," he 
says. "Particularly hot food. If it has to be reheated it is exposed to 
potential bacteria. We're very careful about these things. We have that 
liability." 
</P>
<P>
But Fennelly says hotels are protected from liability for food "donated in good 
faith" by "Good Samaritan" laws in the District of Columbia and neighboring 
Maryland and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some catering directors, like Brent Ashton at the Omni Shoreham, are 
wary of "loopholes in the law." 
</P>
<P>
Hall, the food protection chief, says the only condition he is aware of is that 
food be "transported in the proper vehicle . . . Hot food must be kept hot. 
Cold food cold." 
</P>
<P>
Fennelly characterizes the hotels' position as "baloney . . . They can do it if 
they choose to. A lot of restaurants use it as an excuse not to give food 
away." 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of the hotels couldn't necessarily be bothered," says the Rev. 
John Adams of So Others May Eat, an ecumenical food agency. "It's certainly not 
against the law." 
</P>
<P>
Bryna Monsein, who doesn't want others to repeat her experience, has sought 
legal recourse. Her attorney, Earl Colson, has written a letter that he hopes 
will serve as the basis for future agreements between hotels and relief 
agencies. In it, a charity acknowledges "that we have received the food in good 
condition," and promises "to refrigerate and otherwise keep the food in a 
sanitary condition suitable for consumption." 
</P>
<P>
The agency agrees to release the hotel "from any claim that may arise because 
of your having supplied this food." And also promises to "indemnify you against 
any claim made by any homeless person to whom we have provided portions of this 
food." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legal Until Proven Otherwise 
</P>
<P>
"It will stand up in court" as a contract, Colson says. "Whether a hotel will 
say, 'Oh, that does it,' and contribute the food, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin McPhee of the Mayflower says he has seen similar documents before. "What 
I don't know is, if tested, would it hold?" 
</P>
<P>
In lieu of a test, Monsein recommends a client investigate a hotel's donation 
policy before booking an event. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is, if people knew about it, they would make these arrangements in 
the beginning," she says. "All it involves is saying, 'Will you please?' "

TREE TAPPERS GO WITH FLOW;

IT IS MAPLE SYRUP TIME AGAIN IN THE UPPER MIDWEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The deep Wisconsin woods surrounding Squirrel Lake are silent on this morning. 
Winter snows have just receded to reveal the matted carpet of last autumn's 
remaining leaves. Herb Brooks instinctively knows that it's time to head 
outdoors. He laces up his boots, pulls on a vest jacket over his flannel shirt 
and plops a white tam on his head. 
</P>
<P>
It's maple syrup time again in the upper Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
During a time span of several days, Herb, his wife Romilda and a band of 
neighbors will "tap" hundreds of maple trees on Herb's 14-acre sugar bush, the 
syrupers' term for a stand of sugar maple trees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Retirement Hobby 
</P>
<P>
Herb, an iron worker from Indiana who opted for retirement in the Snow Belt 
rather than the Sun Belt, boils down almost 300 gallons of maple syrup a year 
in his rustic northern Wisconsin "sugar shack," near Minocqua. School children, 
tourists and anyone else who happens by can anticipate a colorful discourse 
about the "hobby that got out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
"It's become a community thing," Herb explains. "The neighbors help out and 
take home their pay in maple syrup." 
</P>
<P>
Herb and Romilda are two of thousands of small-scale maple syrup producers and 
a few large manufacturers in the Midwest. The Heartland's "maple belt" extends 
from Ohio and Michigan to Wisconsin and northern Minnesota. None of these 
states rivals Vermont, the national leader in production, and even the entire 
United States can't match the Canadian province of Quebec. But this first 
harvest of spring still is an important one. 
</P>
<P>
"You know," Herb winks, "when the weather warms up and the sap starts flowing, 
it's not just flowing in the trees." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tapping the Trees 
</P>
<P>
Herb drives his thumb-sized metal spouts (also known variously as taps or 
spiles) into hard maple trees at a point just about three feet above the 
ground. He knows his trees, as a farmer knows his stock: The sugar maples have 
been branded by slowly healing tap scars of springs gone by. Herb, Romilda and 
their crew will put out about 1,200 spouts. 
</P>
<P>
Herb will tell you that a healthy hard maple measuring more than two feet in 
girth can handle up to four spouts in a season. He drills just two to three 
inches deep into the sapwood at a slight upward angle to allow the sap to drain 
easily (the heart wood at the core of the tree yields no sap). 
</P>
<P>
Then, Herb attaches a four-gallon plastic bag, which he drains periodically 
during a period of three weeks. Collection devices vary from the quaint to the 
high-tech. Many old-time syrupers still use clanging metal buckets. A few 
commercial operators opt for the efficiency of an almost-surgical-looking web 
of plastic drainage tubes leading to large collection tanks. 
</P>
<P>
The early spring cooling/thawing cycle releases the upward flow of sap stored 
in the tree's root system. In a good harvest, the sap flows fastest during four 
or five "runs" -- 10 gallons per tap at the peak. Otherwise, the maples slowly 
"weep" their clear, sticky and barely sweet treasure. "The yield depends on the 
weather," Herb explains. "The more changeable it is, the better." 
</P>
<P>
Smoke and steam shroud the sugar shack, where Romilda, the "head cooker," 
directs the transformation of sap into syrup. To make one gallon of syrup might 
take as much as 50 gallons of sap, more if the sap is watery. 
</P>
<P>
"When it comes to the actual work. Romilda does most of the yankin', pullin' 
and jerkin' around here," Herb confesses. Romilda smiles. A cloud of steam 
billows from the oil-fired evaporator, a pair of shallow, covered metal pans 
measuring a total of 36 inches by 120 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Herb and Romilda know the secrets of their calling. Too much time between 
collecting and cooking can sour the sap. And each batch must boil for three 
hours. At the height of the season, syrupers spend late nights in the sugar 
shack. They become sticky, red-eyed apparitions, constantly checking the sap 
level and watching the mesmerizing bubbles. 
</P>
<P>
"The lighter the color of the syrup, the more delicate the flavor," Herb says. 
Some will tell you that syrup from oil-fired evaporators lacks the tang (and 
the cinders) of wood-cooked syrup; that syrup from city maples taste inferior 
to that from country maples; that ground-water is the key to flavor. It's all 
part of the legend. 
</P>
<P>
Well into the summer months, Herb and Romilda will be bottling their Brooks 
Maple Syrup into quart containers for sale at their roadside shop, regaling 
their roadside guests and recalling the syrup makers' age-old chant: "Cold, 
starry nights; warm, sunny days . . . cold, starry nights; warm, sunny days . . 
. one good run before the season ends." 
</P>
<P>
The sap usually starts flowing at Brooks Maple Syrup by the middle of March. 
You'll find Herb and Romilda at Bo Di Lac Drive, Minocqua, WI 54548; (715) 
588-3724. Write or call for directions and tour information. Minocqua is 60 
miles north of Wausau on US-51. 
</P>
<P>
If you can't buy pure U.S. maple syrup at a supermarket, order from Herb. It's 
about $9 per quart, including UPS delivery charge, the entire amount payable 
upon delivery. 
</P>
<P>
In maple-syrup country, folks sweeten just about everything with maple syrup. 
Here are some tips and recipes to try: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Beat equal parts maple syrup and softened butter for a delicious spread for 
bread, toast or muffins. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stir a little maple syrup into barbecue sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Flavor baked beans with maple syrup, mustard and bacon. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give apple pie a new twist. Toss the uncooked apples with maple syrup 
instead of sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Make a maple sundae sauce by cooking maple syrup over medium heat until 
slightly thickened. Stir in chopped nuts and serve warm over ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Substitute maple syrup for molasses in gingerbread, cookies, cakes and 
breads.

GETTING A LINE ON AMERICA'S GROWING APPETITE FOR HIGH-QUALITY FISH; 
</P>
<P>
DISTRIBUTION NETWORK KEEPS CATCH MOVING FROM SEA TO YOUR TABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Health-conscious Americans have turned to fish. While consumption still trails 
far behind chicken and beef, in 1987 Americans ate a record amount of seafood 
-- 15.4 pounds per capita. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the cost of fish escalated more than that of any other 
protein food. This demand has not only put a strain on consumers' pocketbooks, 
but also on the system's ability to provide fish of consistently high quality. 
</P>
<P>
Transporting all this fish from the sea to the plate is a massive and difficult 
task, a race against the clock that must maximize shelf life and minimize 
temperature abuse. For example, if a cod fillet is stored at 32 degrees, its 
shelf life will be 14 days, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service. 
Seven degrees warmer and that cod's shelf life will be cut in half. 
</P>
<P>
From the water, a fish may go through five owners before it is purchased by a 
consumer. Because of their sales volume, supermarket chains can buy directly 
from processors who will ship fish to the chains' main distribution centers. 
From there, the products are shipped to individual stores. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Convolutions, Exceptions 
</P>
<P>
Specialty fish shops and restaurants usually buy from a wholesaler. But there 
are many convolutions and exceptions. Often, wholesalers sell to one another. 
</P>
<P>
To consolidate orders, processors often ship fish back and forth with no 
apparent geographic logic; turbot and john dory caught overseas are flown into 
Dulles Airport outside Washington and shipped to Steve Connelly's seafood plant 
in Gloucester, where they are repacked and then shipped back to Washington 
restaurants. Connelly also buys grouper caught in Florida, processes it and 
then ships it back to Florida restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
"Quiet, boys," the woman orders in a distinctive Boston accent. It is 6:30 on a 
Monday morning, and the start of the Boston Fish Auction. 
</P>
<P>
In a musty room with the atmosphere of a disinterested high-school class, a 
group of about 20 buyers from Boston's fish-processing plants are gathered to 
bid on the morning's catch -- a load from about seven boats that have returned 
from a week out on Georges Bank, one of New England's prime fishing areas. 
These processors ship fish all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from Boston, there are four other fish auctions in the country -- New 
Bedford, Mass.; the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey; Portland, Me.; 
and Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bought Sight Unseen 
</P>
<P>
In Boston the auction is not a display; processors will purchase fish they have 
not seen. 
</P>
<P>
A blackboard at the front of the room lists the names of the boats, the type of 
fish and the amount caught: The Carol Ann, the Captain Sam II, the Nancy &amp; 
Heidi, the True Life, the Reliable. Haddock, cod, gray sole, hake, cusk, 
flounder. For example, the Carol Ann is listed for 500 pounds of haddock among 
its catch; the Captain Sam II, for 500 pounds of gray sole. 
</P>
<P>
The buyers are a hardened lot who know the inner workings of this business like 
the inside of a timepiece. There are people such as Bobby Brandano, in his 
shiny black jacket with Great Eastern Seafood emblazoned in gold, his onyx 
pompadour and his tight-fitting jeans. 
</P>
<P>
Brandano keeps close tabs on what boats have gone out to sea and when they are 
scheduled to return. Fishermen have reputations, and Brandano wants to buy from 
the best. 
</P>
<P>
There's Mike Vitales from Puritan Seafood, who sells to seafood distributors 
who in turn sell to upscale markets and restaurants. (Today, Foehrkolb will buy 
200 pounds of cod, 50 of pollack, 160 of flounder and 120 of gray sole from 
Vitales.) 
</P>
<P>
"All the haddock is for sale," the auctioneer begins. The bidding starts at 
$1.50 a pound, ends at $1.75. There are 3 minutes to bid on each species until 
the buzzer is rung. 
</P>
<P>
During the auction, several of the buyers talk in muffled voices on telephones 
lined against the wall, relaying the bids to their companies as they are 
shouted, inquiring whether they should up the bid depending on their client's 
demands. In between, the woman in charge repeats: "Quiet, boys." 
</P>
<P>
There are a lot of things that are not being said openly here, most of them 
based on the supply of fish landed elsewhere. By 5 a.m., the buyers were in 
their offices, calling around to find out the amount of fish landed at other 
New England ports. 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, the availability and price of fish in Canada also has a 
crucial impact on the price and quality of fish purchased domestically. 
</P>
<P>
Close to 60% of all the groundfish -- the cod, haddock, flounder, etc. -- that 
are eaten in this country are actually landed off Canada, primarily off the 
coasts of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. Domestic waters have been largely 
overfished for these species. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Canadian Fish 
</P>
<P>
This Canadian product is trucked and-or ferried from the Maritimes into the 
United States and is called "over-the-road fish." Because the American dollar 
is worth more than the Canadian, and because the supply of fish is greater, it 
is less expensive than domestic "dock fish" and can be paid for as much as 30 
days later -- a great incentive for many processors, according to Connelly. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the time it takes to get to this country, however, the Canadian 
fish are "almost never as good quality" as domestic fish, Connelly believes. 
</P>
<P>
Practically all New England processors are forced to buy Canadian fish at one 
time or another to meet demand, but "as a rule" more of it will go to large 
supermarket chains, according to Lee Weddig, director of the National Fisheries 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
On this particular morning, market-sized cod sell at the Boston auction for 70 
cents a pound. Over-the-road cod from Canada are selling for 55 cents a pound, 
according to one processor. 
</P>
<P>
Because there are a lot of over-the-road fish available this morning, the 
Boston buyers don't have to clamor for dock fish, which explains the somewhat 
sluggish pace of the auction, the processor said. 
</P>
<P>
But this is where defensive games come in: One processor, who asked not to be 
identified, said that if he knows he will be buying fish from Canada, he may 
start a bid at the auction even though he has no intention of buying it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Secrets 
</P>
<P>
He will open the bid at the price of the Canadian fish, figuring another bidder 
will up the ante. The upshot, he hopes, will be that a competitor will buy the 
load and end up paying more (and having to sell for more) than he does. As he 
explained, "Everybody knows who's doing what to whom." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Morris, sales manager of Empire Fish, said that before fishermen go out to 
sea, they'll arrange code words with him for when they radio in their catches. 
The radio waves at sea are open. "Before they leave, they'll tell us, 'Every 
time we say we're catching pollack, it'll mean haddock,' " said Morris. "Or if 
they say 'we've caught 150 pounds,' it really means 1,500. They could talk in 
Italian, but they're all Italian." 
</P>
<P>
After the Boston auction, the fish prices are relayed to Gloucester processors, 
who set their prices accordingly, generally at 3 cents to 5 cents less per 
pound because the Gloucester boats are unloaded by workers from the processing 
plants themselves. The fishermen don't have to pay "lumpers," workers who 
unload fish at the Boston pier. 
</P>
<P>
The pricing structure gets even more complex: Though Empire paid 67 cents a 
pound for cod on this day, that price has little correlation to what the 
supermarket will pay the processor. Because supermarkets need to know prices a 
week or more in advance to plan for ads, Morris must quote a chain a price even 
before the fish are caught. "You talk about a crap shoot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the 67 cents represents what Empire paid for the whole cod, not the 
fillet. Once the fish is filleted, only about a third of its original weight 
remains. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, that cod really cost Empire $2.23 a pound. According to the prior 
arrangement, the processing firm charged Safeway $3 a pound for the cod. The 
chain then sold it at fish counters for $5.49 -- an 83% markup. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Cockrell, spokesperson for Safeway, said that the chain "does not discuss 
gross profits," but that the markup simply reflects "our costs and the cost of 
getting it to the consumer." 
</P>
<P>
Some people pay the Boston auction price, but after that "there are a zillion 
exceptions," according to Dave Coombs, manager of Steve Connelly's Seafood. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if the fish are not of the quality that the processor expected, 
the price may be renegogiated with the fisherman when they are unloaded. 
</P>
<P>
Or, a processor or distributor who gets stuck with a product that it knows its 
clients will not accept may sell it to another. "I guarantee that the stuff I 
reject gets sold to a less discerning restaurateur," said Bob Kinkead, owner 
and chef at 21 Federal restaurant in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, this type of practice may offer one explanation for the varying 
quality of seafood. For example, on a recent Friday afternoon, a 
Washington-area distributor left a whole swordfish lying in the warehouse, 
rejecting it because its bloodline was brown -- not red -- indicating that it 
was an older fish. At some point during the beginning of the following week, 
the fish would be sold to someone else. In the meantime, it would deteriorate 
further. 
</P>
<P>
Those processors, distributors and wholesalers who are most concerned about 
quality keep close tabs on the fish all along the distribution chain -- 
starting at the docks. 
</P>
<P>
Following the Boston Fish Auction, for example, several of the processors pick 
and choose fish after they are hoisted in canvas bags from boats in the harbor. 
Steve Connelly's Seafood also makes sure that its buyer is in close proximity 
while this is occurring. 
</P>
<P>
"Romeo goes to their weddings, their funerals," said Coombs, referring to the 
relationship his buyer has established with the fishermen. Sometimes, it's 
"Romeo's cousin who's in the hold," he added. 
</P>
<P>
But some processors and distributors are forced to be concerned about volume. 
For that reason, Kinkead believes that generally supermarkets are a bad place 
to buy fish. Not only are they not able to "watch everything that carefully," 
but they are forced to buy less expensive fish to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
A piece of good fresh fish can stand on its own: simply baked, grilled, poached 
or sauteed with a touch of wine, a squirt of lemon or a light sprinkling of 
herbs. But no matter how much attention is paid to a fish along the 
distribution chain, it can all go down the drain if it's improperly cooked. 
</P>
<P>
As George Berkowitz, owner of Boston's Legal Sea Foods restaurants put it, 
"When people tell me they dislike fish, I suspect they probably have spent a 
lifetime eating it overcooked . . . " 
</P>
<P>
To avoid overcooking, Berkowitz offers these basic tips in his book, "The Legal 
Sea Foods Cookbook" (Doubleday, $12.95): 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cook fish just until it has lost its translucency and turned opaque -- no 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Whether it is whole, cut in fillets or left in steaks, bake fish at a high 
temperature -- anywhere from 400 degrees to 450 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Whatever the cooking method, use the rule of thumb: 10 minutes per inch of 
thickness.

GILLIG IS HIGH-PROFILE CITY ATTORNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MEG SULLIVAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After only 10 months on the job, Oxnard City Atty. Gary L. Gillig has made his 
presence felt. 
</P>
<P>
His predecessor was known to doze at the city's lengthy council meetings, but 
not the 42-year-old Gillig. He issues unsolicited opinions, cracks jokes, 
answers questions from the audience and, to express disapproval, sighs loudly 
and casts his eyes skyward. 
</P>
<P>
But for all the theatrics -- "He emotes a little bit too much," said council 
member Ann Johs -- Gillig has sparked substantial changes in city business. 
Besides dismantling the fragile assessment district to promote Oxnard's 
downtown, Gillig has successfully recommended changes in everything from the 
way memos are circulated to the way members of advisory groups are selected. 
</P>
<P>
Some council members, Johs among them, wish Gillig would pipe up less often. 
She sees an alarming trend toward "closed government" in his decisions that 
favored closed sessions and confidential memos. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's very enthusiastic . . . and he tries to do what we want," said 
Johs. "But sometimes he gets too zealous." 
</P>
<P>
In one case, the Ventura County district attorney's office agreed. 
</P>
<P>
In August, the district attorney's office concluded that Gillig was wrong when 
he approved private council meetings for discussion of longstanding squabbles 
between City Manager David Mora, City Clerk Mabi Plisky and Geraldine Furr, 
presently a council member but then city treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
By acting on Gillig's advice, the council violated the Brown Act, the state law 
requiring open meetings, ruled Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury. Gillig 
maintains that he was in the right, but the council has not conducted closed 
meetings on the topic since. 
</P>
<P>
Gillig, who came to Oxnard from Pasadena in May, describes his approach as 
"preventative law" and said he relishes the opportunity to use it as he 
conducts an audit, expected to take three to five years, of all city ordinances 
and contracts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defends His Style 
</P>
<P>
"I've worked with other councils where they were happy for me to just sit there 
and look pretty," he said. "But the Oxnard City Council has indicated an 
interest in minimizing their exposure to litigation, and I've been encouraged 
to speak up and intervene whenever they're on . . . a precipice." 
</P>
<P>
Council member Manuel Lopez said he generally approves of Gillig's 
intervention. However, he said he regrets Gillig's recommendation in January 
that only the mayor -- not the entire council -- appoint members to the city's 
citizen advisory groups, which advise the city on such issues as cultural 
affairs, the municipal golf course and policies on rent control for the owners 
of mobile home. 
</P>
<P>
The decision gives the mayor "dictatorial powers," Lopez complained. "How can 
you beat him? Hell, he'll have appointed everyone in every CAG in the city." 
But Lopez said he doesn't fault Gillig for "just interpreting the law." 
</P>
<P>
But critics say there is a fine line between offering a legal interpretation 
and making a decision that rightfully rests with the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale City Atty. Frank R. Manzano, past president of the City Attorneys 
Assn. of Los Angeles County, who is familiar with Gillig's work, faults Gillig 
for getting "involved in the discussion to reach political decisions." 
</P>
<P>
"When you're sitting in a council chambers, you're not the sixth council 
member," he said.

JAPAN-BASED COLLEGE BUYS HISTORIC GLEN TAVERN INN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Paula's Glen Tavern Inn, a historic Ventura County landmark that dates 
from 1911, has been sold to a Japanese business college for slightly more than 
$2 million, both sides of the deal said this week. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo Business College will convert the Craftsman-style hotel into a 
residential Center for Western Studies where up to 100 business students will 
learn the English language and Western culture in intensive 90-day seminars 
beginning as soon as May 11, director Sue Ellen Arimitsu said. 
</P>
<P>
The college, which specializes in international business programs, has 13 
campuses throughout Japan. It has branches in Seoul and Taipei, but the Glen 
Tavern marks Tokyo Business College's first venture in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Arimitsu said the school's directors were enchanted by Santa Paula's quaint 
character and impressed by the three-story Glen Tavern, which has fallen upon 
hard times recently as a hotel and restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very happy with the site. The building is beautiful and Santa Paula is a 
real typical American small town," Arimitsu said. Besides, "we got a nice 
reception from the city." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bidding 'Sayonara' 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, if Santa Paula's city fathers are bidding a fond sayonara to their 
historic hotel, they are greeting the Tokyo Business College Center for Western 
Studies with an equally eager konnichiwa. 
</P>
<P>
Each student probably will spend $4,000 to $5,000 during the three-month stay 
on meals, entertainment and souvenirs, Arimitsu said, which will prove a boon 
to the area's merchants. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to bring a real economic spark of vitality to Santa Paula," Mayor 
Carl Barringer said. "This could bring a whole new approach to life in Santa 
Paula." 
</P>
<P>
The economic vitality will be enhanced by cultural cross-pollination. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo Business College officials say they plan to offer classes for local 
residents in introductory Japanese and traditional arts such as flower 
arranging, tea ceremonies and watercolor painting. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, Japanese students will take advantage of recreational programs 
offered by the city of Santa Paula such as golf, music and dance. The visitors, 
most of whom will be 18 to 20 years old, will get around on bicycles; the 
school prohibits them from driving in the United States, Arimitsu said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Keep Name 
</P>
<P>
The school also plans to keep the Glen Tavern name. Students will live on the 
second and third floors and be schooled by American teachers in English, music, 
culture, and U.S. history and government. The program is comparable to the 
"semester abroad" offered by many American campuses, Arimitsu said. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the sale call for the Glen Tavern Restaurant and Bar on the first 
floor to remain open to the public. Both have been under new management since 
Dec. 1, and the restaurant offers upscale Italian, Mexican and American 
cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real positive plan for the community because it continues to have the 
Glen Tavern enjoyed by the community as well as shared by a different culture," 
Barringer said. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Bolton, president of the Santa Paula Chamber of Commerce, echoed the 
mayor's views. 
</P>
<P>
"This helps the community. Being a business person, I'd rather see the thing 
active, and it hasn't been real active recently," Bolton said. 
</P>
<P>
The sale to Tokyo Business College is the latest chapter in the illustrious and 
at times eerie history of the Glen Tavern Inn, the only hotel in the county 
that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Watering Hole 
</P>
<P>
Built by a consortium of Santa Paula investors, the Glen Tavern soon became a 
watering hole for guests from the flourishing oil and citrus industries. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1920s, the film industry descended on the town, bringing with it a host 
of well-known guests for Glen Tavern, from John Barrymore to Rin Tin Tin. 
</P>
<P>
Psychics say the most intriguing guests were the ghosts -- as many as nine -- 
who haunted the rambling hotel. One purportedly looked like Buffalo Bill, and 
another resembled a long-dead perfume saleswoman named Ellen and left a floral 
scent. 
</P>
<P>
The inn has also been a speak-easy and a boarding house. In recent times, it 
returned to its function as a hotel, bar and restaurant. Since 1983, it has 
been owned by Mel Cummings of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Cummings, who said he lost a lot of money on the business because he lacked 
hotel experience, last year considered offers to turn the facility into a 
health spa or a drug-and-alcohol rehabilitation facility similar to the Betty 
Ford Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Approached in November 
</P>
<P>
He said the Japanese school approached him in November. 
</P>
<P>
Arimitsu, who plans to relocate from Valencia to Santa Paula when the school 
opens, said the Glen Tavern provides an ideal location for Japanese students to 
learn about the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The students will be able to get around and they're not in a real urban area, 
yet it's close enough to Los Angeles that we can have excursions," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Glen Tavern provides an atmosphere conducive to learning. 
</P>
<P>
"It's far from the stereotypical cement cinder-block room you think of when you 
think of a dorm," Arimitsu said.

COACH C AND 'THE INCIDENT'; 
</P>
<P>
AS CRITICS CRY 'FOUL', A SANTA CLARA LEGEND REBOUNDS AFTER HIS CONTROVERSIAL 
CALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his early years at Santa Clara High School, Lou Cvijanovich would sometimes 
line his players in front of a mirror in the locker room at halftime. "Take a 
hard look at your faces," Cvijanovich would bellow, his own face lit with 
intensity. "Are you proud of yourselves? Are you playing the best game you can 
possibly play?" 
</P>
<P>
Cvijanovich, who at 62 now uses a somewhat softer approach, has taken a hard 
look at himself recently after suffering through the most embarrassing 
controversy of his 31 years as Santa Clara's basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
And there are unshakable voices in the background -- an unsettling chorus of 
accusers and ax-grinders bent on drawing blood from a coach recognized as one 
of the winningest in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The incident," as he refers to it, occurred during the last week of December, 
but it gnawed at Cvijanovich (pronounced Cee-YAWN-o-vich) until Feb. 16, when 
sanctions were handed down by the CIF-Southern Section, a governing body of 
athletics for 470 Southland high schools. 
</P>
<P>
And as his team prepares for the Southern Section 2-A Division championship 
game Saturday, he would rather the incident be forgotten much the way he tells 
his players to forget bad passes and stupid fouls. Learn from a mistake, he 
preaches, then put it behind you and push on. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God it's over. Let me start anew," Cvijanovich pleads. "I've been 
tormented enough. You wouldn't believe what I've been through over this." 
</P>
<P>
The trouble began Dec. 28, when Cvijanovich refused to bring his team back for 
the last two days of a tournament at Estancia High after the Saints blew a 
13-point, fourth-quarter lead against Edison and lost, 39-38. The officiating, 
by all accounts, was atrocious. Cvijanovich, whose ample horse sense constantly 
wrestles his impulse to stampede, reasoned that anybody can be robbed, but only 
a fool returns to the scene a day later. 
</P>
<P>
Breaking a written contract with the tournament was deemed outrageous by the 
Southern Section executive committee, which after hearing testimony from 
tournament officials and Cvijanovich, placed the entire Santa Clara athletic 
program on probation for 16 months. In addition, the basketball team is barred 
from playing in regular-season tournaments next season and the school must 
compensate Estancia High for revenues lost by virtue of Santa Clara's two 
forfeited games. 
</P>
<P>
Outrage was also the reaction of several opposing coaches and the media. Just 
more proof, it was repeated, that Cvijanovich rules Santa Clara with an iron 
hand but believes himself above the rules. "Some say he had it coming," said 
the coach of a team that is regularly beaten by Santa Clara. A column Feb. 5 in 
the Ventura Star-Free Press asked if high school basketball needs its own Bobby 
Knight, denouncing Cvijanovich for leaving the tournament and for not allowing 
his players to speak with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, for all his bluster, Cvijanovich has drawn a fiercely loyal following. 
Many Ventura County coaches learned their trade under him. Ex-players express 
little other than admiration for him and one, Thomas S. Johnson, wrote a 
biography of Cvijanovich titled, "More Than A Coach." 
</P>
<P>
And nobody can deny that he's a winner. 
</P>
<P>
His basketball teams have a record of 592-202, making him the winningest 
continuously active coach in the West behind Ralph Tasker of Hobbs, N. M. 
Cvijanovich's teams have won about 75% of the games he's coached in three 
sports -- more than 850 victories in all. 
</P>
<P>
"Talk to any coach around and they'll confirm that Lou Cvijanovich is the class 
of the high school coaching ranks," says UCLA basketball coach Jim Harrick, who 
lives in Newbury Park and has scouted Santa Clara players for many years. "I 
saw his team play two weeks ago. His kids play great defense and any player 
from Santa Clara will be disciplined and fundamentally sound. In college, that 
can save a year of instruction." 
</P>
<P>
John Reardon, the Rio Mesa High football coach of 21 years, is second in 
service only to Cvijanovich among active coaches in the county. He began 
coaching as an assistant at Santa Clara in 1963 and '64. "Lou is an 
institution," Reardon says. "If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be coaching or 
teaching. He was a role model for me and I follow his philosophies to this 
day." 
</P>
<P>
Cvijanovich's nature is as expansive as his career has been distinguished and 
he cements friendships through rituals of food and drink at such Oxnard 
establishments as Sam's Saloon, which is owned by two of his sons. 
</P>
<P>
Lou's teams usually win, and Lou always buys. 
</P>
<P>
"A good time to me is sitting down with a great bunch of people, eating dinner 
and having a couple drinks," he says. "Breaking bread and drinking with people, 
somehow there is a change of heart and a change of mind. World leaders ought to 
do that, I'm convinced. There would be a lot more peace in the world." 
</P>
<P>
These days, he would settle for peace of mind. Perhaps the lasting lesson of 
the controversy is that at an age when most of his contemporaries have long ago 
quit coaching and are counting the semesters to retirement and life in a 
customized golf cart, Lou Cvijanovich still burns with competitive desire. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he is distressed that the turmoil has distracted his players from 
their quest for the 2-A championship. The Saints (22-3), whose only losses are 
the one to Edison and the ensuing forfeits, will face Orange Lutheran for the 
title at 10:30 a.m. Saturday at the Sports Arena. The winner qualifies for the 
state tournament, which Santa Clara has never won. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had a team that has been through what this team has gone through 
because of me," says Cvijanovich, who is also Santa Clara's athletic director. 
"They have weathered this beautifully." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, he has had lots of teams with which to compare. Coach C, as he is 
known at Santa Clara, has led the Saints to 12 Southern Section championships 
(two in football, one in baseball and nine in basketball) and holds the section 
records for most overall and basketball titles. From 1958 until 1970 he coached 
all three sports (he quit baseball in '70 and football in '75) and by 1964 -- 
the year John Wooden won his first NCAA basketball title at UCLA -- Cvijanovich 
had won seven Southern Section titles. His teams have won 33 league 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
What has he done lately? The Saints are one win away from their fifth Southern 
Section title of the decade. By comparison, all other Ventura County basketball 
teams have won a grand total of five Southern Section championships since 1950. 
</P>
<P>
"Lou is one of the most consistent people I've known and his record speaks for 
that consistency," says Jim Swisher, an administrator at Santa Clara who played 
under Cvijanovich in the early 1960s. "He keeps up with changes in the 
profession, is very well-read and is on top of every new method." 
</P>
<P>
Those methods extend beyond the court to the fundamentals of fund-raising. 
Santa Clara, one of two coeducational Catholic high schools in the county, has 
a tight network of boosters who don't tighten their purse strings when the 
basketball program is in need. 
</P>
<P>
The school was $50,000 short of funds for completing its $1-million gymnasium, 
Friedrich Pavilion, three years ago before Cvijanovich and booster Ed Knight 
had a brainstorm. 
</P>
<P>
"We organized a sit-down dinner for boosters in the old gym, all the booze you 
could drink," Cvijanovich recalls. "We got 304 people. I put up the number 50 
on the scoreboard, 15 minutes on the scoreboard clock and announced that I 
wanted that 50 erased by the time the clock expired. In 15 minutes we raised 
$63,000." 
</P>
<P>
His methods also include transforming talented but undisciplined Oxnard toughs 
into Saints through equal application of discipline and understanding. 
</P>
<P>
"Lou's players are very disciplined, almost mechanical in what they do," says 
Bob LaBelle, who coached basketball from 1979 to 1987 at Agoura High, a 
Frontier League foe of Santa Clara. "His approach works with the kid who goes 
there. He can be very tough on a player, but if that kid has an arm around him, 
it will be Lou's." 
</P>
<P>
With a strong word or a swift kick, Cvijanovich, a 6-foot-3, 265-pound 
self-described "mean old cuss," fills players with fear ("The fear of God," he 
has said many times) to form a fearless team. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of exorcising the toughness inbred in a boy, he exercises it and straps 
it to a leash just long enough to frighten the wits out of every pleasant 
opposing player whose soft touch was developed shooting free throws on a quiet 
suburban driveway. His players, all of whom shave their heads before the 
season, are known for rabid defense, savage screens and relentless rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
However, Cvijanovich also appreciates the less aggressive, more thoughtful type 
of player. 
</P>
<P>
"The non-aggressive kid has attributes that the aggressive kid doesn't have," 
he says. "I make our kids tough. People say you can't, but you can talk to 
kids, rally them and get them to really go after it. These are nice kids I'm 
talking about. 
</P>
<P>
"Other kids are naturally aggressive and you have to harness that, give it 
direction. It takes both kinds. They learn from each other." 
</P>
<P>
Understanding what makes a teen-ager tick is perhaps Cvijanovich's greatest 
gift. And he has learned that results of his efforts are often delayed. "At 17, 
I was a nut. It all sunk in later," he says. "That's why I will help any kid, 
athlete or not. The percentage is that a lot of kids will fail now and see the 
light later." 
</P>
<P>
Understanding what makes Cvijanovich tick requires a glimpse into his 
upbringing. 
</P>
<P>
He was born Luka Cvijanovich in 1926. His Serbian emigrant father ran a saloon 
in Jerome, Ariz., a copper-mining town and authentic slice of the Old West 150 
miles north of Phoenix. A historical booklet published by Southwest Parks and 
Monuments Assn. describes the Jerome of the 1920s, '30s and '40s as "a hard 
story of hard rock, hard work, hard liquor and hard play." 
</P>
<P>
Cvijanovich recalls that as a teen-ager, he and friends would "sit up on a 
cement slab above town and look down on all the fistfights." 
</P>
<P>
Besides his tightknit family, Cvijanovich's only escape from the temptations of 
what the New York Sun once described as "the wickedest town in the West" was 
his high school coach in three sports, Frank Sancett, a disciplinarian who went 
on to coach the University of Arizona baseball team to the College World Series 
10 times in 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
"He instilled values that I instill in my players," Cvijanovich says. "You 
cannot succeed unless you work hard. There are lots of pitfalls and you must be 
strong enough to persevere." 
</P>
<P>
Lou's high school sweetheart, Martha Sue Stanley, wouldn't marry him unless he 
got a college education. After serving in the Navy during World War II, 
Cvijanovich married and graduated from Arizona State. Lou, Martha and their 
son, Sam, the first of eight children, moved to Oxnard, where Lou landed a 
junior high school teaching and coaching job in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
Five years later, Cvijanovich began his career at Santa Clara and soon earned a 
reputation for a quick-draw temper. 
</P>
<P>
"Our doctor says that Lou will never have a heart attack because he yells and 
blows off his stress," Martha Cvijanovich says. The doctor also told Martha not 
to encourage her husband to retire. "Lou needs the release and, of course, he 
loves coaching so," she says. 
</P>
<P>
The coach brightens at the mention of future Saints, whom he calls his cherubs. 
"They're a fine bunch," he says as he details a recent upset scored by a team 
from one of Santa Clara's four feeder grammar schools. 
</P>
<P>
Cvijanovich, who says "I'll coach until I drop dead," unlocks the doors of 
Friedrich Pavilion at 8 a.m. every Saturday and readies the court for the Santa 
Clara youth league of 26 teams. 
</P>
<P>
His generosity with the gym extends to other schools -- two Saturdays ago both 
Santa Clara gyms were in use from 9 a.m. until 10 p.m. In addition to the youth 
league, the Oxnard College men's and women's teams had games and two high 
school girls' playoff games were held. "That's got to be a record," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Reardon, the Rio Mesa football coach, points out the side of Cvijanovich that 
those grammar school players know, saying, "Lou is a very compassionate man, a 
very giving man." 
</P>
<P>
And while it might not ring true to his detractors, Cvijanovich espouses a 
global point of view. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line, after you get past the wins and losses, is kids and the 
U.S.A.," he says. "Sometimes we screw up the whole athletic thing by building 
these bitter rivalries. It's just kids. Leave it on the floor. The only team is 
the human race. If it becomes divisive, then it's a waste of time." 
</P>
<P>
It is in this spirit that Cvijanovich went on his hands and knees to help Marc 
Groff, the St. Bonaventure High basketball coach, paint a newly required 
three-point stripe on the St. Bonaventure court two years ago. "He had already 
done the line on his floor, so he came over to mine and spent four hours 
drawing the arc," Groff recalls. 
</P>
<P>
St. Bonaventure played Santa Clara for the first time two weeks ago in the 
opening round of the playoffs. The Saints won, 77-53, but the Seraphs -- like 
most Santa Clara victims -- left the court with their dignity intact. 
</P>
<P>
"They could have really roughed us up," Groff says. "But Lou made a point of 
not running up the score." 
</P>
<P>
For Cvijanovich, a win is not complete unless he wins over the opposition as 
well. As for the finger-pointing foes who have recently caused him anguish, he 
only wishes he could sit them all around a table and buy everyone dinner and a 
round of drinks. By the end of the evening, he's certain, the room would be 
full of nothing but Saints.

RACIAL RELATIONS FORUM ANGERS COUNCIL INCUMBENTS; 
</P>
<P>
TEMPLE SINAI ACCUSED OF POLITICAL AMBUSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The two incumbents in the Glendale City Council election last week accused 
leaders of the city's only Jewish synagogue of staging a political ambush and 
discriminating against Christians by holding a candidates' forum on racial 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Carl Raggio and Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg refused to attend the Sunday 
morning forum held at Temple Sinai on North Pacific Avenue. In a press 
conference two days before the forum, Raggio and Bremberg said they thought it 
was designed to aid the campaign of Robin Westmiller, who is Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
The forum organizers said they were shocked by the accusations, which they 
emphatically denied. 
</P>
<P>
Bremberg and Raggio cited several reasons for not attending, including the 
"insensitivity" of holding a political meeting at a time when Christians are 
going to church. 
</P>
<P>
"I perceive this as a subtle or not so subtle form of discrimination," said 
Bremberg, one of 13 candidates running for three council seats in the April 4 
election. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meeting of Sunday Criticized 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the forum is to communicate with the public and the public at 
large is being excluded" by scheduling the meeting on Sunday morning, Raggio 
added. 
</P>
<P>
The two incumbents further charged that they were being set up. "When I was 
invited to the forum, I was told to be prepared to be attacked," Bremberg said, 
with Raggio nodding in agreement. "I feel it's a setup." 
</P>
<P>
Bremberg said the forum had been orchestrated to help Westmiller, a member of 
the temple's sisterhood. "She set it up to make all of the other candidates 
look as though we're intolerant and bigoted," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Temple leaders said the forum was organized in response to Jewish concerns 
about human relations, especially in light of a December, 1987, incident in 
which swastikas and anti-Semitic remarks were painted on the temple. 
</P>
<P>
They denied staging the event for Westmiller, who sits on the city's Human 
Relations Council. 
</P>
<P>
As for scheduling the event on a Sunday morning, temple officials acknowledged 
that it was a mistake but said none of the candidates raised any objections 
when they were invited. 
</P>
<P>
At the Friday news conference, Bremberg and Raggio acknowledged that they never 
requested a schedule change. 
</P>
<P>
Challengers Dick Jutras, Richard Matthews, P. E. Dorris and Gary Siglar also 
pulled out at the last minute, reducing the panel to seven candidates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Statement Read 
</P>
<P>
Before the forum began, temple representative Rosalie McKee read a prepared 
statement addressing the controversy: "Some candidates have declined to appear. 
We regret any misunderstanding which may have been caused by our efforts to 
open our meeting to the larger community. Had we known that the timing of our 
program created any discomfort, we would have rescheduled in an effort to 
accommodate all concerned." 
</P>
<P>
The forum was scheduled in place of the temple's so-called bagel brunches, a 
monthly morning event with invited speakers. Bremberg was the guest speaker at 
one such Sunday brunch in 1987, forum organizer Gayle Moskowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
"The only conclusion I can reach is that Bremberg and Raggio are dodging the 
issue" of human relations, said Selma Stevens, vice president of the Sisterhood 
of Temple Sinai. 
</P>
<P>
The forum proved to be much less controversial than the incumbents' 
accusations, with all participants basically agreeing that the city needs to 
keep working to improve human relations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
50 in Attendance 
</P>
<P>
About 50 people attended and the candidates spoke about such topics as hate 
crimes, day laborers, the homeless, immigration and bilingual education. 
</P>
<P>
Public relations executive Berdj Karapetian proposed the creation of an 
interfaith, multi-ethnic commission to serve as a liaison between the minority 
communities and the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Landscaper Richard Seely emphasized the need to educate children about 
different cultures at school to avoid the formation of racial stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate broker Joe Ayvazi said he was against bilingual education because 
"the sooner the immigrant learns the English language, the sooner he can take 
advantage of the great opportunities this country has to offer." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Shirley Griffin said the city should take hate crimes more seriously. 
"Don't forget the lessons of history," she warned, referring to the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
Former Planning Commission member Nida Solana Brown, a daughter of Spanish 
immigrants, said she learned ethnic tolerance while growing up in a culturally 
diverse New York City neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Council Criticized 
</P>
<P>
Westmiller, who runs a public speakers' bureau, said the City Council had 
failed to keep its promise of improving minority hiring and promotion 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
The Temple Sinai meeting was the second candidates' forum held last week. On 
Wednesday evening, the 11 Republican candidates presented their platforms 
before the Glendale-Verdugo Republican Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
After the forum, the Assembly endorsed the two incumbents and real estate 
broker Joe Ayvazi. Richard Seeley, a Democrat, and Berdj Karapetian, 
noncommitted, were not invited to speak.

OXNARD CITY COUNCIL DISSOLVES ASSESSMENT DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MEG SULLIVAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oxnard City Council members Tuesday dissolved an assessment district designed 
to promote the city's beleaguered downtown because the ordinance establishing 
it contains one incorrect word. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Gary L. Gillig, who revealed the flaw in the district's enabling 
ordinance in January, told the council that the district could not withstand a 
legal challenge as it is written and so it is unenforceable. 
</P>
<P>
The council also voted to return $34,532 in fees collected so far by the 
district to stage advertising campaigns, festivals and other efforts to upgrade 
the downtown area's image. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's a Shame' 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we had a choice," Councilman Manuel M. Lopez said after the 
meeting. "If anyone objected to paying the assessment they didn't have to. You 
can't have a district that way. It's a shame." 
</P>
<P>
The fatal flaw in the ordinance was that it cited a 1965 state code describing 
the assessment as a "tax." Proposition 13, the law that forbids cities to raise 
property taxes without an election, ruled out such taxes in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
But a law passed a year later reinstituted the districts by describing their 
fees as "assessments." 
</P>
<P>
Council members were pessimistic about the likelihood of reviving the district 
because of opposition that has steadily grown against its fees since it was 
approved a little more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, more than half of the downtown's 450 businesses have refused to pay 
the assessments, which ranged from $33 to $300. 
</P>
<P>
The district was approved with the support of only slightly more than 20% of 
merchants, the minimum allowable, said Steve Kinney, the director of Oxnard's 
Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
He said he thinks that the Downtown Oxnard Business Improvement Assn., the 
organization that had positioned itself to receive the funds, might be 
successful if it reintroduces the district in a year or two. 
</P>
<P>
By then,, the Oxnard Redevelopment Agency will have opened a children's museum 
and a business complex created from historic homes, which may in turn build 
support for further revitalization efforts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The assessment district had been billed as the extension of redevelopment 
efforts in the flagging area where merchants banded together two years ago to 
roll back a pedestrian mall that had choked off business on A Street for 18 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Such districts now exist in 100 to 150 California cities, according to David 
Kilbourne, a Chico businessman and a past president of the California Downtown 
Assn., which advises businesses on how to revive blighted downtowns. 
</P>
<P>
"If the opposition would let these people function for 24 months, they'd 
probably be pleasantly surprised," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Behrens' Memory Invoked 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's meeting, assessment supporters begged council members to allow 
them to do just that by invoking the memory of Al Behrens, a former A Street 
shop owner who became the patron saint of revitalization in downtown Oxnard. He 
pushed to have the mall removed and an assessment district established, but 
died last June. 
</P>
<P>
"The city can save this district," said B. T. Martin, the owner of a 6th Street 
printing shop and the president of the Downtown Oxnard Business Improvement 
Assn., "or it can treat Al Behrens' memory the same way Pontius Pilate treated 
Christ's." 
</P>
<P>
But Gillig told the council that "there is no method by which the council can 
salvage the district. The government has to dot every 'i' and cross every 't.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
The district's opponents, who appeared to outnumber supporters by a 5-1 margin 
at Tuesday's meeting, expressed relief at the council's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they finally have an idea of all the good reasons for disestablishing 
this district," said Lee Montemorra, who owns the Sportsmen's Exchange, a C 
Street gun shop, with her husband Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents had questioned the authority of the Downtown Business Assn. They had 
contended that state code dictates that only the City Council could decide how 
the funds could be spent. City officials disagree. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents had also questioned the need for the district, pointing out that much 
of downtown is occupied either by professionals or specialty shops that would 
not benefit from the retail-oriented campaigns planned by the association. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't buy more firearms because there's a parade, a festival or coupons 
in the paper," Anthony Montemorra said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
But members of the business community said they will not be so easily 
discouraged. They vowed to continue paying into the district on a voluntary 
basis in the hopes of continuing the efforts of the Downtown Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"People have paid hard cash to reopen A Street . . . and they're not going to 
walk away from that investment," said Dana Young, president of the Oxnard 
Chamber of Commerce.

OBSERVATORY TO FOCUS ON ECLIPSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Moorpark College's Charles Temple Observatory will be open Tuesday for viewing 
of the partial solar eclipse, which will begin at 8:17 a.m. and last until 
11:58 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Hal Jandorf, an astronomy instructor at the college, said that at the eclipse's 
maximum, the moon will block 36% of the sun. He warned that permanent eye 
damage can occur if the eclipse is viewed directly through telescopes, 
binoculars or sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
Jandorf advised viewers to focus the image of the sun on a pocket mirror 
directed at a shaded wall. The mirror should be covered by a sheet of paper 
with a small hole punched in it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The observatory will offer viewing through several telescopes equipped with 
safety devices.

IN DEFENSE OF FAMILY MEDIATION PROCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iam compelled to write this letter in response to the recent attacks upon the 
Family Relations Department of the Ventura County Superior Court and the family 
law division of the court. These attacks have served to spread misinformation 
and irrational fears of the court and mediation process in this community. 
</P>
<P>
I am proud to serve the people of the county of Ventura as the senior mediator 
of the Family Relations Department of Superior Court. I have worked as a 
divorce mediator for the past six years and have seen approximately 2,500 
families in times of crisis. I work with a staff of compassionate, competent, 
insightful and ethical persons, each with their own styles, skills and unique 
backgrounds. Our staff is varied, including persons from diverse ethnic, 
racial, religious and social groups; one man and eight women. We share a 
commitment to children and families. The staff is thorough, informed and 
articulate about our work with divorcing families. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the court considers our expert opinions and the data on which they 
are based seriously, as it does other evidence presented in contested custody 
and visitation hearings. These issues are perhaps the most important of those 
brought before the court because they involve the well-being of children. It is 
a statutory requirement that each contested custody case be referred to 
mediation in an attempt to help the parents themselves determine the course of 
their children's lives. 
</P>
<P>
The Family Relations Department sees only 10% of divorcing families. The other 
90% either have no children or resolve custody and visitation issues 
themselves. Of the 10%, approximately 85% of these families are able to resolve 
the issues with the help of their mediator. An additional 10% are referred to 
private psychologists of the parents' choosing for evaluation and written 
report to the court. Five percent are referred for investigation by the judge, 
usually by agreement of the parents. Our department has 3 1/2 investigators, 
most of whom have worked in this capacity for 10 to 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
Only 1% of these cases goes to hearing. These represent those families who have 
not been able to resolve their differences, even with the help of skilled 
attorneys, informal conferences with judges, clinical intervention by mediators 
(all licensed mental health professionals), custody investigators and/or 
private psychological evaluators. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to other court functions, our department is an agency of healing, 
not blaming. Occasionally, our client families are unable to disconnect from 
the blaming, which comes from the pain of shattered dreams and lives. 
</P>
<P>
In some contested hearings, mediators in Ventura County provide expert 
testimony to the court, but only with the protections of due process (upon 
receiving a subpoena and subject to examination in open court by the litigants 
or their legal representatives). While some counties disallow litigants from 
calling mediators to testify, other counties do not provide the protections of 
due process. Instead, mediators speak with or write memoranda to the court 
without the requirements of subpoena or cross-examination. 
</P>
<P>
In order for Ventura mediators to make informal recommendations to the court, 
the parties (usually through their attorneys) must both waive this right solely 
for the purposes of a conference and may speak with the judge only in the 
attorneys' or parents' presence. It is relatively rare that mediators make 
statements to a judge under any circumstances. Our goal is to promote 
self-determination in divorcing families, to empower parents at a time when 
they are on the verge of losing control over their children's lives. 
</P>
<P>
Children usually thrive when two parents are able to put their hurt aside and 
reassure the children of their ongoing love. We know through our expression and 
through carefully conducted research that children respond to unrestrained 
parental conflict in extremely negative ways, both immediately and in the 
long-run. We aid families every day in resolving their conflicts so that their 
children can grow emotionally, physically, intellectually and spiritually. I am 
proud to work with these parents and the staff of the Superior Court Family 
Relations Department.

BUENA HIGH PROVES SEMI-TOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Buena High's athletic program has enjoyed semi-sweet success in the Southern 
Section playoffs this season. In three sports, the Bulldogs have been knocked 
out in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
In football, Canyon beat Buena, 45-14. 
</P>
<P>
In boys' basketball, Capistrano Valley defeated Buena, 84-71. 
</P>
<P>
And in girls' basketball, Hart upended the Lady Bulldogs, 78-68, in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Buena, however, has spent more time celebrating than telling sob stories about 
what might have been. 
</P>
<P>
All three teams had so many obstacles to overcome that a .500 record would have 
been considered a success. 
</P>
<P>
The football team went 2-8 in 1987 and was a perennial doormat in the Channel 
League until Rick Scott took over the program this season. 
</P>
<P>
The boys' basketball team lost two all-county players -- Shawn Kirkeby and Mike 
Sandoval -- and was picked to finish a distant third in the Channel League. 
</P>
<P>
Buena has had one of the most successful girls' basketball programs in the 
Southern Section, but the team lost two starters to season-ending injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really proud of the job our coaches have done," athletic director and 
girls' basketball Coach Joe Vaughan said. "We have a lot of kids that don't 
mind working hard and coaches that put the time and effort into developing 
winning programs.

"Sure, we're disappointed that we've lost in the semifinals in three sports. 
But how many schools have had as much success?"

Buena also reached the playoffs in girls' tennis and boys' and girls' soccer.

CAMARILLO TAKES IMITATION TOO FAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Coach Jack Willard took over the girls' basketball team at Camarillo High 
three years ago, he tried to emulate Buena's program. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started this program, the team had been struggling," Willard said. "I 
wanted them to play and look like the best. We tried to run the same drills as 
Buena. 
</P>
<P>
"I even bought uniforms that look like Buena's because we have the same color 
scheme. When we didn't make the playoffs, I took everyone to see Buena play." 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo may have taken the imitation to an extreme, however. The Scorpions, 
who won 20 games for the first time, lost in the Southern Section semifinals -- 
as did Buena. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our team resembles Buena more than past Camarillo teams," Willard 
said. "We haven't won a championship, but the players were convinced they could 
do it. We're thinking like winners and that's what I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Record update: At Camarillo, when it comes to school-record setters for girls' 
basketball you need to know just two names -- Nicole Victoria and Angie Long. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria, a 5-6 junior guard, has set nine records, including points in a 
season (548), points in a career (1,334), field goals in a season (202), 
assists in a season (108) and steals in a season (106). 
</P>
<P>
Long, a 5-9 senior, established 11 school records, including points in a game 
(34), free throws made in a season (142), consecutive free throws made (11) and 
rebounds in a season (262). 
</P>
<P>
Three-point gamble: Buena boys' basketball Coach Glen Hannah said he's a bit of 
a gambler, but a long shot he picked Friday night came up short. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs were trailing Capistrano Valley, 71-69, in a Southern Section 5-A 
playoff game when Hannah elected to go for the lead. He instructed Jeff Oliver 
to take a three-point shot with about 1 1/2 minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver's attempt was close, bouncing in and out of the basket. Capistrano 
Valley got the rebound and proceeded to outscore Buena, 13-2, down the stretch 
for a 84-71 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to gamble," Hannah said. "I wanted to put them in a hole. I called it 
earlier in the game and it worked." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't surprising that Hannah selected Oliver since the senior set a school 
record by sinking 79 three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
"He was open and he shot it well," Hannah said. "It just didn't go in." 
</P>
<P>
Schwan contributions: Kurt Schwan, Westlake's center who was named the Marmonte 
League's most valuable player, finished the season averaging with 21 points and 
11.1 rebounds, both team-highs. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, no other Warrior finished averaging double figures in scoring. Mike 
Waggoner was closest with 8.3 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Schwan made 55% of his field-goal attempts and 73% of his free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Schwan, who will attend Weber State, also led the Warriors with 45 steals. 
</P>
<P>
Another California trembler: Rick Pearn, a transfer from Canada, made his first 
appearance as a pitcher for Ventura High in an intrasquad scrimmage Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"He throws pretty hard," Ventura Coach Dan Smith said. "I let him pitch in the 
scrimmage and his knees were shaking. I asked him why and he said, 'Coach I've 
never pitched in California.' " 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he could use all the help he can get. Every starter on last year's 
4-A semifinalist has graduated, including all-Southern Section selections Steve 
Dailey, Darrell McMillin and David Eggert. 
</P>
<P>
Wrestling with success: Delfino Ochoa will try to become the first wrestler 
from Hueneme to win a state wrestling title in this weekend's meet at the 
University of the Pacific in Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa, who competes in the 119-pound division, improved his record to 47-1 
after winning the Master's Meet on Saturday at Fountain Valley High. Ochoa 
defeated Nogales' Jeff Maes, 3-1, in the semifinals and Eric Ramos of El 
Rancho, 10-3, in the championship. Maes placed third in the state last year in 
the 122-pound class. 
</P>
<P>
Hueneme Coach Kevin Callaway said Ochoa's forte is takedowns. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very aggressive," Callaway said. "If he can't ride them, he'll let 
opponents get back up so he can take them down. I think he's got a good shot at 
being our first state champion." 
</P>
<P>
Hueneme has had two wrestlers place in the state meet, according to Callaway. 
Willie Dillon finished second in 1978 and Bernie Neri took third in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Noel Juarez of Oxnard (105 pounds) and Robbie Cook of Rio Mesa (132) also won 
Masters titles. 
</P>
<P>
The top six finishers at the Masters meet qualified for the state 
championships. Other qualifiers from Ventura County included Chris Kilbane of 
Newbury Park, Billy Hunter of Westlake, M. T. Merickel of Channel Islands and 
Tony Flores of Rio Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Merickel, who placed third at 126 pounds, is a Southern Section 4-A Division 
champion and two-time Marmonte League champion. "M.T. is the hardest working 
wrestler I've ever had in the 10 years I've been at Channel Islands," Coach Rob 
Vieira said. "He had to cut off a lot of weight during season. He naturally 
weighs between 145 to 150 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
Recruiting time: Moorpark College (16-15), which was eliminated by Compton 
College on Saturday in the first round of the Southern California regional 
basketball tournament, has two sophomores -- Alex Porter and Steve Murphy -- 
who hope to be recruited by a Division II college. 
</P>
<P>
"At this time, I don't see them going Division I," Coach Al Nordquist said. 
"They will probably play for a good, solid NAIA or Division III college." 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark, the 22nd-seeded team in the Southern California regional playoffs, 
made only 19 of 51 shots from the field and committed 13 turnovers in losing, 
67-49, to Compton. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Roger Thomas scored a career-high 22 points to lead Moorpark, which 
trailed from the outset. 
</P>
<P>
"We played hard but we just could not hit the shots we needed," Nordquist said. 
"We have been less gifted as far as talent all year long, but we have played 
smart." 
</P>
<P>
Fifth-seeded Ventura (27-5) did not begin its state title quest until this week 
after drawing a first-round bye. The Pirates played host to Rancho Santiago, 
the 12th-seeded team, Wednesday. Results of the game were unavailable at press 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Good times: The best is yet to come for Coach Tuck Mason of the Ventura College 
men's and women's track teams. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura men's team won its first Western State Conference meet last week 
without its top high jumper, Reggie Betton, who also plays on the basketball 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of early to tell right now, but I think we have a real chance to win 
conference if everybody stays healthy," said Mason, who is in his 12th season. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates should be strong in the high jump with Betton sophomore Mike 
Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant sat out last season because with eligibility problems after winning the 
Southern California Decathlon Championships as a freshman. Ventura will get its 
first test Saturday when it competes in the Santa Monica invitational.

New Technology Developed: Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Corp. said it has 
produced the world's smallest radio receiver, which will pave the way for 
production of super-miniature mobile telephones. Japan's giant domestic 
telecommunications company said the production of the 26 gigahertz receiver was 
made possible by the firm's development of a new uniplanar circuit 
configuration for monolithic-microwave integrated circuit, or MMIC. The firm 
said the uniplanar MMIC can help reduce cost and size and improve reliability 
of super-high-frequency equipment.

Pepsi's Hot Spot: Just about anyone watching commercial television tonight -- 
almost anywhere in the world -- has a good chance of viewing the much 
ballyhooed Pepsi-Cola commercial featuring rock star Madonna. The two-minute 
ad, which ad industry sources estimate cost Pepsi more than $1 million to 
create and upwards of $5 million to air, will be shown in 40 countries. The ad, 
which features Madonna debuting her new song "Like a Prayer," will be aired in 
the United States during the first commercial break of "The Cosby Show" on NBC. 
Later in the evening, 30-second versions of the ad will air during the TV shows 
"Cheers" and "LA Law."

GAF Trial to Continue: The federal judge hearing the stock manipulation case 
against GAF Corp. and its vice chairman denied their motion to dismiss the 
case. GAF and James Sherwin requested the dismissal after the government 
concluded its arguments Tuesday. But U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe said 
the government had presented sufficient evidence for the case to continue. The 
government has charged GAF, a specialty chemical company, and Sherwin with 
attempting to boost the price of Union Carbide shares in 1986.

U.S. AND KOREA FIRMS WILL SELL TWO-DECK VCR; 
</P>
<P>
MARKETING PACT REACHED AFTER FILM INDUSTRY DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Hoping to become a mouse that roared, tiny Go-Video Inc. announced Wednesday 
that it has reached an agreement with Samsung Electronics Co. of Korea that 
will allow the video firm to become the first to market a dual-deck 
videocassette recorder in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Called the VCR-2, the new machine will allow consumers to tape two TV shows 
simultaneously, watch a rented movie while taping a TV program, edit and merge 
videotapes, or copy them -- all of which previously required two separate VCR 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
Go-Video will be the sole distributor of the VCR-2 in this country, while 
Samsung will distribute the machine in the rest of the world under a licensing 
agreement with Go-Video. The agreement also allows Go-Video to license its 
technology to other electronics firms worldwide. The company expects the 
machines to be available in this country by year-end. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Long Struggle 
</P>
<P>
According to R. Terren Dunlap, Go-Video's founder and chairman, the Scottsdale, 
Ariz., company "will be doing the engineering, design and production of some 
microprocessors here, but the machine will be assembled and fully manufactured 
in Korea by Samsung and shipped back into the United States for sale." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm extremely happy today," the 44-year-old Dunlap said. "This has been a 
six-year battle to get this product to the American public." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the fight had been with the Motion Picture Assn. of America, which 
feared that a dual-deck VCR would steal potential profits from movie makers and 
distributors by allowing consumers to cheaply and quickly duplicate rented 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
However, the MPAA recently withdrew its objection to the VCR-2 when Go-Video 
agreed to equip the machine with a device that prevents the duplication of 
videocassettes that contain an anti-copying signal. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-copying features, like the dual deck design, were developed by 
Go-Video. "We are going to give the software manufacturers the (anti-copying) 
technology at no charge," Dunlap said Wednesday. "We have solved their problem 
with our machine." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gyrating Stock 
</P>
<P>
Go-Video has had its own problems, too. The company, which operates a small 
video production studio, lost money last year on sales of less than $500,000. 
Its stock went public in 1986 and has gyrated wildly since, trading as high as 
$24 a share and as low as 50 cents. The shares have traded recently for between 
$7 and $8. 
</P>
<P>
In its efforts to get the VCR-2 on the market, Go-Video has been engaged in a 
highly publicized battle with a number of Japanese and Korean electronics 
manufacturers. It claims in a $250-million antitrust lawsuit that the 
electronics firms conspired to prevent Go-Video from manufacturing and 
marketing its patented dual deck by refusing to supply necessary parts. 
</P>
<P>
The suit originally named the MPAA and a number of major Hollywood movie 
studios, but they have since been dropped, as has Samsung, under the provisions 
of the manufacturing agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Dunlap said his company will "vigorously pursue" the suit against the remaining 
defendants, which include Sony Corp., Matsushita Electronic Industrial Co. 
(Panasonic), Victor Co. of Japan (JVC), Sharp Electronics Corp., Sanyo Electric 
and NEC Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"We have now proven to the electronics industry that you can bring products to 
the marketplace despite a cartel of Japanese electronics industrialists that 
are destroying American consumer electronics manufacturing," Dunlap said. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now there are no manufacturers of VCRs in this country, no manufacturers 
of radios, black-and-white televisions or fax machines, and only a small number 
of color TVs are made in the United States," he said, adding that American 
electronics firms "have no guts in standing up against the competition." 
</P>
<P>
"They have given up and sold out our industries to Japan. We're proving today 
that you can do something about it."

3 L.A. BANKS AMONG 60 INSTITUTIONS; 
</P>
<P>
SEARS HIKES MINORITY BANK CREDIT LINE TO $30 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A syndicate of 60 minority-owned banks said Wednesday that Sears, Roebuck &amp; 
Co. has increased its revolving line of credit with the institutions to $30 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The banks represent the largest consortium of minority-owned financial 
institutions assembled for a line of credit and comprise roughly two-thirds of 
the minority-owned banks in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Among the institutions are three banks in Los Angeles that are primarily owned 
by Chinese-Americans. They are Cathay Bank, one of the oldest and largest 
Asian-owned banks in the city; Far East National Bank, and Los Angeles National 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
"By doing business with one big corporation, you hope that it will spread out 
to other large corporations," said Henry Y. Hwang, chairman and chief executive 
of Far East National, which has assets of more than $200 million. "They also 
give you a pride that you are chosen." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Started in 1983 
</P>
<P>
Many minority-owned banks are very profitable, particularly some of the more 
than two dozen Asian-American banks in California. But they often have 
difficulty reaching beyond their traditional minority customer base to big 
corporations. The Sears line of credit illustrates that small, minority-owned 
institutions can do business with major corporations, said Alvin J. Boutte, 
chairman and chief executive of black-owned Independence Bank of Chicago, the 
lead bank in the syndicate. 
</P>
<P>
"It also stimulates growth for minority banks and the minority communities that 
they serve," Boutte said. 
</P>
<P>
The institutions in the consortium are in 24 states. The owners are black, 
Latino, Asian-American, women and American Indian. 
</P>
<P>
Sears established the line of credit, which is used for general business 
purposes, with a smaller group of minority banks in 1983, and the amount of 
credit has grown each year. This year, the figure was increased $5 million from 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago-based retailer's corporate treasurer, Edward J. Condon Jr., said 
the credit line is part of the company's support of economic development in 
minority communities.

DOW OFF 15.35; INTEREST RATE JITTERS CITED

<TEXT>
<P>
Stock prices tumbled in late trading Wednesday, giving up an early gain under 
the pressure of renewed interest rate worries. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, up more than 10 points in the early 
going, closed with a loss of 15.35 at 2,243.04. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Big board volume totaled 177.21 million shares, up from 147.43 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted that the market had shown signs since the start of the week of 
recovering from the jolt it suffered last week as a result of bad news on 
inflation and a round of interest rate increases. 
</P>
<P>
The upswing continued as rates declined modestly in the bond and short-term 
money markets Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
But then the bond market gave up its gains as traders studied a government 
report showing stronger-than-expected gains in personal income for January. 
</P>
<P>
By late afternoon, prices of long-term government bonds showed losses of about 
$5 for each $1,000 in face value. And stocks followed the bond market's lead. 
</P>
<P>
"People are coming to the belated recognition that interest rates will have to 
move higher," said Abby Joseph Cohen, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. investment 
policy analyst. 
</P>
<P>
Although the market rose Monday and Tuesday, investors have moved tentatively, 
worried that interest rates are likely to rise further. Stock prices took a 
beating last week after half-point hikes in the prime and discount rates. 
</P>
<P>
"Investors aren't quite sure what they want to do," Cohen said. "That's why the 
market has been so volatile." 
</P>
<P>
Losers among the blue chips included International Business Machines, down 1 
5/8 at 119 7/8; General Electric, down 1/4 45; American Telephone &amp; 
Telegraph, down 1/4 30, and Union Carbide, down 1/2 at 29 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange eased for the third straight session 
Wednesday, depressed by the U.S. dollar's rise against the Japanese yen and 
uncertainty over interest rates. The Nikkei 225-share index gave up 21.30 to 
close at 31,964.30. 
</P>
<P>
In London, stock investors virtually overlooked news of a wider-than-expected 
British trade deficit and bid shares higher on newly found hopes that the 
government might be able to avoid raising interest rates. At the close, the 
Financial Times 100-share index was up 18.9 at 2,021.3. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose broadly Wednesday, benefiting from weakness in the British 
pound. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices pulled back in domestic and overseas dealings. Republic National 
Bank of New York quoted a late bid of $383.80 an ounce, down from $387 late 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The weakness of the pound pushed the dollar and the Deutsche mark higher," 
said John McCarthy, chief dealer at the Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling suffered because of unexpectedly bad figures on Britain's trade 
performance during January and persistent doubts about Britain's overall 
economic health. 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers dumped pounds after release of the trade report. In an effort 
to counter the selloff, the Bank of England, the country's central bank, 
intervened in the market, buying pounds. 
</P>
<P>
One pound cost $1.7243 in London late Wednesday, nearly 2 cents cheaper than 
Tuesday's late $1.7430. It was the pound's lowest level since Oct. 11, when 
sterling stood at $1.7175. 
</P>
<P>
The pound later ended in New York at $1.72325, down from $1.7430 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, dealers bid up the value of the mark on grounds that West 
German monetary authorities soon might raise interest rates to reduce economic 
activity and relieve inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
European dealers had earlier sold marks amid speculation there that prospects 
for higher West German interests have diminished, in part because of the 
currency's strength. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo trading, which ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
closed at 127.68 Japanese yen, up from 127.15. Later, in London, the dollar 
traded higher at 128.15 yen, and in New York, the dollar finished at 128.225 
yen, up from 126.89 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CREDIT 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices fell sharply Wednesday as the market reacted poorly to two 
government reports showing modest economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was off 17/32 point, or about $5.30 per 
$1,000 face amount. Its yield increased to 9.17% from 9.12% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the market resumed a downward trend in low-volume trading after 
two days of advances. 
</P>
<P>
The main factors were government reports showing that personal income rose a 
stronger-than-expected 1.8% in January while construction spending rose 0.4%, 
which was in line with expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"We seemed to hit a brick wall . . . coinciding with the release of 
construction and income data for January. They're both reasonably vigorous," 
said William V. Sullivan, director of money market research for Dean Witter 
Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
There has been concern in the bond market about sustained economic growth and 
rising inflation, both of which eat away at the value and yield of fixed-income 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Wednesday's trading indicated that bonds are not getting help from 
the strength of the dollar overseas, which normally tends to make 
dollar-denominated issues more attractive to foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
were down 3/32 point, intermediate maturities were off by between 7/32 point 
and 7/16 point and long-term issues fell as much as 21/32 point, according to 
Telerate, a financial data service. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Prices of copper futures soared Wednesday amid supply concerns prompted by 
labor unrest in Peru and underlined by the small number of copper delivery 
notices posted on New York's Commodity Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
On other exchanges, precious metals futures prices plummeted, soybean futures 
dropped sharply and grain, energy, livestock and meat futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Copper settled 3.9 to 8.8 cents higher on the Commodity Exchange, with the 
contract for delivery in March at $1.455 a pound, the highest settlement price 
for the March contract since Jan. 27, but still well below the record high for 
spot copper of $1.6475 a pound reached Dec. 8 on the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The rally was sparked by news that miners in Peru, the world's sixth-largest 
copper producer, would consider extending a planned three-day strike if 
conditions warrant. The strike is scheduled to begin March 26. 
</P>
<P>
The reports stirred memories of last fall's 57-day Peruvian mining strike, 
which was a major factor in copper's rise to record price levels. 
</P>
<P>
Demand for copper remains strong and supplies continue to be tight, a situation 
reflected in the slim number of delivery notices posted Tuesday and Wednesday 
on the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil futures posted modest gains on the New York Mercantile Exchange, but 
prices for refined products ended narrowly mixed. 
</P>
<P>
West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 10 to 13 cents higher, with April at 
$18.28 a barrel; heating oil was 0.29 cent lower to 0.30 cent higher, with 
April at 50.49 cents a gallon, and unleaded gasoline was 0.08 cent lower to 
0.30 cent higher, with April at 51.56 cents a gallon.

ENLISTS INVESTMENT BANKERS TO HELP FIGHT TOPPER BID; 
</P>
<P>
EMHART FIRES BACK WITH ALLEGATIONS AGAINST SUITOR 
</P>

<P>
Emhart Corp., the manufacturing concern facing an unsolicited $2.4-billion bid 
from Topper LP, on Wednesday filed legal claims against its suitor and hired 
its own investment bankers for a possible takeover battle. 
</P>
<P>
Emhart said it had retained Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co. and Shearson Lehman 
Hutton Inc. as financial advisers but added that it would continue to study the 
Topper offer and announce conclusions and recommendations no later than March 
9. 
</P>
<P>
Topper made its $35-a-share bid for Emhart's 67.6 million outstanding shares 
last Thursday after the stock market closed. 
</P>
<P>
Topper is an investment partnership controlled by Gordon Getty, son of the late 
oil mogul J. Paul Getty, who is worth an estimated $350 million, and the Fisher 
family, headed by brothers Lawrence and Zachary, which has made an $800-million 
fortune in New York real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Emhart said the new legal action involved counterclaims filed in the U.S. 
District Court in Richmond, Va., in response to an action brought by Topper 
seeking to overturn its shareholder rights plan and certain provisions of 
Virginia corporate law. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the company said he could not elaborate on the details of the 
filing, which alleged securities law violations by Topper. 
</P>
<P>
Emhart stock closed Wednesday at $40 a share, down 25 cents from Tuesday's 
close but still well above Topper's bid price, in New York Stock Exchange 
composite trading. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Wall Street analysts said they believed that Emhart may be worth 
more than $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
They noted that Topper has deep pockets and could afford to increase its offer 
closer to that level if a bidding war erupted or if Emhart sought to negotiate 
a friendly deal. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Topper said it owns 5.1 million Emhart shares, or just under 8%, and 
said it has arranged financing for the $2.19 billion needed to buy the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Although vague takeover rumors had swirled around the company since December, 
when its stock was trading at about $22, the takeover offer came as a surprise 
to Emhart, some of whose products date to 1839 and include True Temper golf 
club shafts, Molly bolts, Kwikset locks and Russwin and Corbin hardware. 
</P>
<P>
Emhart has about 30,000 employees and reported record earnings of $126 million 
on revenue of $2.76 billion for 1988. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Among Emhart's diverse products are fasteners, hardware, bottle-making 
machinery, lawn and garden equipment, golf club shafts, bicycle frames and 
materials for shoes. One subsidiary, Pacoima-based Price Pfister, makes faucets 
and plumbing supplies.

KAISER ENGINEERS MERGING WITH UNIT OF ITS VIRGINIA PARENT FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Kaiser Engineers Group, one of the largest engineering firms in the West, is 
being merged with another subsidiary of its corporate parent, American Capital 
&amp; Research, the holding company announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser will combine with ICF Inc., a Fairfax, Va., consulting firm, and the 
resulting company will be called ICF Kaiser Engineers. Its headquarters will be 
in Oakland, where Kaiser is now based. 
</P>
<P>
American Capital &amp; Research, also of Fairfax, acquired financially troubled 
Kaiser last June from a consortium of banks led by Bank of America. Kaiser's 
Australian and Asian operations were then spun off. 
</P>
<P>
ICF Kaiser Engineers will be a subsidiary of another new firm, ICFcorp 
International, which is wholly owned by American Capital. 
</P>
<P>
American Capital said Kaiser, which was losing $1 million a month when it was 
sold last June, is now earning $1 million a month. "That's what a company its 
size should be doing," said William C. Stitt, chairman and president of ICFcorp 
International. 
</P>
<P>
Stitt said Kaiser's $70-million debt has been eliminated and that American 
Capital had bought a portion of the debt at a deep discount and forgiven it.

TEXAS EASTERN UNITS TO BE SOLD TO BRITISH FIRM FOR $1.4 BILLION

<P>
Texas Eastern Corp.'s oil and gas production and exploration units will be sold 
for about $1.4 billion to a British concern to help finance a friendly takeover 
by Panhandle Eastern Corp., Panhandle announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement with Enterprise Oil PLC was reached just days after the two 
Houston natural gas companies signed a $3.2-billion merger agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"They were able to reach this deal so quickly because the sale to Enterprise 
had been under consideration by Texas Eastern before Panhandle Eastern made its 
offer to acquire the company," Panhandle Eastern spokesman Jim Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
The sale to Enterprise Oil includes Texas Eastern's holdings in the British and 
Norwegian sectors of the North Sea, Denmark, Indonesia, the Netherlands and 
Alaska, Panhandle Eastern said. 
</P>
<P>
The holdings include 13 producing oil and gas fields, six fields that are under 
development and 14 undeveloped fields. 
</P>
<P>
Enterprise Oil is an independent oil and gas exploration and production 
company, according to a notice of the proposed acquisition. If the purchase is 
approved, Enterprise said it will become the leading independent oil 
exploration and production company in the North Sea in terms of reserves, 
production and acreage. 
</P>
<P>
Panhandle Eastern's Feb. 20 merger agreement included a provision to sell 
non-pipeline assets to help finance the acquisition. Panhandle Eastern 
officials said the sale announced Wednesday was a big step toward that goal. 
</P>
<P>
Robert D. Hunsucker, chairman, president and chief executive of Panhandle 
Eastern, said his company approved the sale under terms of the merger 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Hunsucker said Panhandle Eastern expected the sale to net more than $1.2 
billion after taxes, with proceeds to be used to help pay off most of $1.7 
billion in short-term loans taken out for the Texas Eastern buyout. 
</P>
<P>
"The $1.4-billion sale price meets our expectations and is completely in line 
with what our financial analysis revealed," Hunsucker said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The sale is expected to be complete in 60 to 90 days, officials said, and is 
subject to approval by Enterprise Oil shareholders and the British government. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Eastern and Panhandle Eastern officials said last week that Texas 
Eastern's 44% share in Petrolane Partners of Long Beach also could be sold 
within 60 days after the merger is complete. 
</P>
<P>
The master limited partnership, formed through the company's Petrolane Inc. 
subsidiary in 1987, serves the international liquid petroleum gas market. 
</P>
<P>
Panhandle Eastern is financing 80%, or $2.6 billion, of its $3.2-billion 
takeover along with $1.05 billion in refinancing and working capital, Hart 
said.

JOHNSON PUT ON STEROIDS IN '81, COACH TESTIFIES 
</P>

<P>
Ben Johnson's track coach testified here Wednesday that he put the Canadian 
sprinter on a steroid program in 1981 because the performance-enhancing drugs 
were "worth a meter" in Johnson's event and because keeping up with the 
competition made it necessary to use the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The revelation came during the second day of Charlie Francis' wide-ranging 
testimony before a Canadian inquiry into drugs and sports. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spurred to Investigate 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government was spurred to create this investigative commission 
after Johnson lost his gold medal and world record in the 100-meter dash at the 
1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul because he tested positive for an anabolic 
steroid. 
</P>
<P>
Francis in his testimony also implicated at least a half-dozen prominent 
current and former Olympic athletes in steroid use, including Florence Griffith 
Joyner. 
</P>
<P>
Francis said he first approached Johnson about steroids in the summer of 1981, 
but said he "was not sure of the advantages." That fall, Francis said, Johnson 
"decided he would go on." 
</P>
<P>
"If he wanted to compete, it's pretty clear that steroids are worth a meter at 
the highest level of sports," said Francis, who has been Johnson's coach since 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he understood that his competitors were on them." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson has maintained that he never knowingly used drugs to enhance his 
performance. Francis' only previous statement since the Olympics was that the 
sprinter's urine test may have been sabotaged. 
</P>
<P>
Francis said that after he introduced Johnson to steroids in 1981, the drugs 
were later administered by Johnson's personal physician, Jamie Astaphan. 
</P>
<P>
Astaphan, who has promised to travel from his home in the Caribbean to testify 
in Toronto, has denied that he gave the drug to Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
In hour after hour of detailed testimony on the use of anabolic steroids and 
growth hormones, Francis said that at an early stage, top female sprinter 
Angella Taylor Issajenko injected Johnson and fellow sprinter Tony Sharpe with 
the steroids, while the two men injected Issajenko with a growth hormone. 
</P>
<P>
He said he first worked on steroid programs with Issajenko in 1979 and with 
Johnson and fellow runners Desai Williams and Sharpe in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
He implicated 11 Canadians, all his athletes. They have been advised not to 
talk to the media. 
</P>
<P>
Francis said he initially looked at the progress of women's competition before 
discussing the program with Issajenko in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Using a graph in the packed hearing room, he pointed to the increase in the 
women's 100-meter records over the past decade and described it as "a 
monumental blip" from what could be expected. 
</P>
<P>
He cited the 10.49-second 100-meter record set last year by Florence Griffith 
Joyner. He did not mention her name, referring to her as "this lady in 
question, and said, "This girl would beat the great Jesse Owens by four feet." 
</P>
<P>
Though Francis stopped short of saying Griffith Joyner's world-record 
performance was the result of using steroids, he mentioned it in the context of 
performance-enhancing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith Joyner, who retired from track last Saturday, was unavailable for 
comment, but her agent, Gordon Baskin, strongly denied that the runner had used 
a banned substance. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is the truth and the truth will prevail -- Florence has never and 
will never use steroids," Baskin told the Associated Press from his office in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"She has gone through so many tests with the USOC (U.S. Olympic Committee) the 
TAC (The Athletic Congress) and the many governing bodies." 
</P>
<P>
Baskin said after Johnson tested positive in Seoul, there were rumors about 
other leading athletes, including Griffith Joyner. 
</P>
<P>
"The IOC thought it was so unfair that they made a specific announcement that 
Florence has never tested positive," he said.

BLEAK FUTURE PREDICTED BY O.C. BUDGET EXPERTS; 
</P>
<P>
DEFICITS OF UP TO $50 MILLION FEARED UNLESS NEW REVENUE SOURCES ARE FOUND OR 
SERVICES CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Orange County's budget crisis could worsen dramatically in the next 5 years, 
with annual deficits that could reach $50 million, unless taxes are raised and 
services sharply reduced or state and federal officials deliver more help, a 
report released Wednesday concludes. 
</P>
<P>
In the first study of its kind in Orange County, forecasters portray a 
financially strapped county government which already has nearly exhausted its 
reserves to balance the budget. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts predicted annual deficits ranging from $4 million to $50 million 
between fiscal years 1989-90 and 1993-94 if there is no increase in the 
county's current revenue. The forecast released by the county administrative 
office said those same deficits could climb to $109 million a year if the 
county were to begin any new programs or projects. 
</P>
<P>
Associate County Administrator John Sibley, coordinator of the report, 
acknowledged that the findings "are indeed gloomy," adding, "we obviously do 
not have the revenues to meet our future demands." 
</P>
<P>
If the county doesn't find new income, Sibley said, a range of county services 
and projects could be seriously hampered, most notably health and welfare 
programs, road construction and the expansion of jail and court facilities. 
Sibley also said the county would face the "delicate task" of trying to remain 
competitive in salaries with other governments when negotiating new contracts 
with its 12,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
County government pays for operations of the Orange County Fire Department and 
the Sheriff-Coroner's Department, which includes operating county jail 
facilities and the Harbor Patrol, and juvenile justice facilities such as 
Juvenile Hall and other youth correctional programs. The county also funds the 
offices of the district attorney, the public defender, the county marshal, the 
Probation Department, the registrar of voters and the assessor. 
</P>
<P>
A large portion of the county budget goes toward health and social services, 
such as paying for medical care for the indigent who are not covered by 
Medi-Cal, providing programs for the disabled and mentally ill, drug and 
alcohol abuse counseling, foster children, administering welfare programs and 
tracking communicable diseases. 
</P>
<P>
The county also maintains county roads, operates John Wayne Airport, runs the 
county regional parks system, oversees development of land in unincorporated 
areas, and provides environmental health programs and animal control. 
</P>
<P>
Robert MacLeod, general manager of the Assn. of Orange County Sheriff's 
Deputies, said the county's "protestations of poverty" are nothing new. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't ever remember hearing the county say they didn't have money," said 
MacLeod, whose association represents 1,200 deputies. "To some extent it's like 
the little boy who cried, 'Wolf!' At this point, their forecast of lack of 
funds doesn't carry much credibility." 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors requested the 5-year budget projection last fall for a 
long-range view of the county's budget problems and possible solutions. It is 
strictly a planning document that examines the situation from a "worst case 
scenario," officials said, and it makes no specific recommendations on what, if 
any, programs or projects should be eliminated or solutions adopted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Tough Budget Decisions' 
</P>
<P>
However, it does illustrate, rather bluntly, the potential financial troubles 
facing the county. 
</P>
<P>
"This report will help frame the tough budget decisions that are ahead," said 
Christie McDaniel, executive assistant to Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas 
F. Riley. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a surprise that we may be looking at strong cutbacks in a number of 
areas," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The bleak budget forecast was blamed on a series of factors, including the 
federal budget deficit, inadequate funding from Sacramento for state-mandated 
programs for the poor and elderly, and the formation of new cities in south 
Orange County, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
The incorporation of Mission Viejo and Dana Point, for example, is expected to 
cost the county between $8.7 million and $22 million in lost revenue such as 
sales and property taxes that now are going directly to those new cities. 
</P>
<P>
Sibley said the loss in tax revenue is not offset by the savings to the county 
in discontinuing police and fire protection, trash, street maintenance and 
other services provided to the unincorporated areas. 
</P>
<P>
Two tax proposals are mentioned in the report as possible ways to offset the 
forecasted deficits. 
</P>
<P>
A proposed statewide ballot initiative could generate an estimated $125 million 
annually for Orange County. The measure would transfer proceeds from a 
half-cent of the existing sales tax receipts from the state to counties, the 
report says. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County is also exploring whether to ask voters for a half-cent sales tax 
increase to build new roads or a new jail, which is needed to relieve serious 
overcrowding at the men's central jail in Santa Ana. That proposal would also 
generate about $125 million a year for the county. 
</P>
<P>
However, even if voters approved a half-cent sales tax increase, it would not 
cover the construction or annual operating costs of a new jail, the report 
says. The estimated cost of building a new 3,199-bed jail proposed for Gypsum 
Canyon in the eastern county is about $430 million. To operate the facility 
would cost another $100 million a year, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
And without such measures, the county's financial future looks grim, with a 
projected $38-million deficit looming next year, Sibley said. 
</P>
<P>
County officials narrowly avoided financial trouble this year by adopting a 
series emergency measures and drawing heavily on reserves. 
</P>
<P>
In December, the supervisors implemented a countywide hiring freeze and 
recommended not replacing employees who leave or retire in order to reduce 
staff by 3%. The hiring freeze will remain in effect until the current fiscal 
year ends on June 30, Sibley said Wednesday. He did not rule out a similar 
freeze next year. 
</P>
<P>
The county's cash reserves are down to $15 million, below the level recommended 
by credit rating agencies for financial integrity, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In the coming years, analysts said, the county, without new revenue, will be 
unable to replenish those reserves, "raising questions as to the county's 
ability to make debt payments." 
</P>
<P>
Sibley said the study's importance is providing county officials with a 
"glimpse into the future." This is the first attempt, he said, at taking a look 
at the budget beyond a year or two.

THORNBURGH REASSURES BOOK INDUSTRY ON BOMBINGS

A group of publishers and booksellers, fearing that bookstore bombings will 
continue, met Wednesday with Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh and received his 
assurance that "every resource available" will be used to hunt down the bombers 
and guard against future attacks. 
</P>
<P>
In the meeting, which lasted more than an hour, 10 representatives of 
publishing houses and three representatives of booksellers expressed their 
concerns in the wake of Monday's firebombings of two Berkeley, Calif., 
bookstores and a New York weekly newspaper in apparent retaliation for the sale 
and support of the book "The Satanic Verses" by Salman Rushdie. 
</P>
<P>
After the session at the Justice Department, Thornburgh told reporters: "There 
simply is no room for any threat against the exercise of First Amendment 
rights." 
</P>
<P>
He added that he discussed the capabilities of law enforcement officials in 
gathering information and was assured by literary representatives that 
investigators will have their "fullest cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Hughes, chairman of the Assn. of American Publishers and the group's 
spokesman, said he was satisfied that federal investigators will do everything 
they can "to prevent terrorism in this country." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, President Bush denounced violence and vowed to protect the rights 
of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh said that the FBI, in investigating the bombings, will draw on 
"years of experience with terrorist activities" and added that, in the meeting, 
he had "expressed our determination to see that the President's commitment of 
yesterday is fully honored" by law enforcement officials.

The nation's leaders held emergency meetings Wednesday after army generals 
rejected the prime minister's pleas for support, apparently leaving him little 
choice but to resign. 
</P>
<P>
With troops on alert throughout the country, members of Sudan's five-member 
collective presidency -- the Supreme Council -- were meeting with political 
leaders to solve the crisis, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi had threatened to resign next Sunday 
unless the army allowed him to form a broad-based government and assured him it 
would continue to respect the constitution. 
</P>
<P>
The day after his statement, the generals insisted that their demand for 
reforms, given to Mahdi nine days ago, be carried out in full. 
</P>
<P>
In their earlier ultimatum, the officers told Mahdi that he should either spend 
more money on defense or accept a pact drawn up between rebels and the 
Democratic Unionist Party to end the five-year-old civil war in the south. 
</P>
<P>
Mahdi has also asked trade unions, whose frequent work stoppages have plagued 
his 33 months in office, to freeze strikes so long as the war with the rebels 
continued. 
</P>
<P>
But 37 trade unions and political parties have rejected Mahdi's request.

BUSH CITES MEXICO COOPERATION ON DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush told Congress on Wednesday that Mexico has "cooperated fully" 
with the United States in the fight against narcotics trafficking, heading off 
the threat of penalties under a U.S. foreign aid law. 
</P>
<P>
But Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in an accompanying report, offered a 
gloomy picture of the worldwide drug trade. "The international war against 
narcotics is clearly not being won," Baker wrote. "In fact, in some areas we 
seem to be slipping backwards." 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Baker offered their assessments in the federal government's annual 
reports on international narcotics controls. Under foreign aid laws, the 
Administration must cut off aid and oppose international loans to countries 
that fail to cooperate with U.S. efforts to stop drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Several senators who sought to penalize Mexico over the drug issue last year 
said they do not plan to press for sanctions this year, largely to give Mexican 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari -- who took office Dec. 1 -- what one 
called "the benefit of the doubt." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's decision to certify Mexico's cooperation on drug efforts, and the waning 
enthusiasm in the Senate for punitive measures, appeared to defuse -- at least 
temporarily -- an issue that has been a chronic irritant in U.S.-Mexican 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the President also complained that corruption in Mexico remains "a 
serious impediment" to law enforcement efforts there and indicated that the 
United States will continue to pressure the Salinas government on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I am encouraged by the new president's strong public stance against drugs," 
Bush said in a written statement explaining his decision on Mexico. "However, 
there are problems with the program. . . . Mexico remains the No. 1 
single-country source for heroin and the No. 2 source for marijuana." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kerry's Complaint 
</P>
<P>
Sens. John Kerry (D-Mass.) and Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), who led efforts to 
penalize Mexico last year, both indicated that they would follow Bush's lead. 
</P>
<P>
Kerry complained that the State Department's certification that most foreign 
governments are cooperating with anti-drug efforts is difficult to square with 
the reports of increased drug production. But he added, "In the case of Mexico, 
the new president most likely deserves the benefit of the doubt." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson also does not plan to seek a resolution against Mexico, "because there 
has been some progress made by the new (Salinas) administration," an aide said. 
</P>
<P>
But an aide to Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) said he still intends to seek 
sanctions against Mexico. Last year, the Senate voted, 63 to 27, to penalize 
Mexico, but the resolution died in the House. 
</P>
<P>
In his report to Congress, Bush withheld certification on anti-drug cooperation 
from only six countries: Afghanistan, Burma, Iran, Laos, Panama and Syria. 
</P>
<P>
Because the United States provides no aid to any of the six governments, the 
practical impact of the President's decision appeared negligible. 
</P>
<P>
Among the countries that received approval, six were presented as borderline 
cases: the Bahamas, Bolivia, Colombia, Mexico, Paraguay and Peru. One, Lebanon, 
received approval under a "national interest" exception; although Lebanon is a 
major exporter of hashish, its drug-producing area is largely under Syrian 
control. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Wroblewski, the State Department's assistant secretary for international 
narcotics matters, said Baker's assessment that the drug war is being lost was 
based on increasing narcotics production worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at the numbers . . . what you see is an increase in marijuana 
production, opium production and coca production," she said. "What we see 
correspondingly around the world is an increase in drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"Those twin increases fuel, of course, an increase in the power of the drug 
trafficking cartels, and that worries us," Wroblewski said.

WALL OF WATER, SAND SWEEPS STORM DRAIN WORKER TO DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE FRANK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A construction worker sealing the inside of a 36-inch storm drain in Newport 
Beach was killed in a freak accident Wednesday when a nearby water line 
ruptured, releasing sand and water that swept him 200 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a rush of water and it washed him down," said Manuel Montero, 32, of 
Corona, another construction worker who said he was in a hole around the 
opening of the drainpipe when he heard the gushing water and had time to get 
out. 
</P>
<P>
The coroner's office identified the victim as Romulo Lopez, 52, of Perris, in 
Riverside County. He was pronounced dead at Hoag Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred shortly after noon at the Promontory Point Apartments 
near Bayside Drive. The construction project, which included the storm drain 
and street curbs, was being done by Byron L. Crume Inc. of Corona, Newport 
Beach police said. The company was under contract by the city of Newport Beach, 
officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Montero said he heard the worker scream as the water entered the pipe and swept 
him away. Montero entered the storm drain at the bottom of the hill through a 
manhole and tried to find his co-worker in the water, mud and sand. At one 
point, he said, he was able to touch Lopez's arm, but he was lifeless. 
</P>
<P>
Police, firefighters and city life guards arrived, Montero said. About 30 
minutes after the pipe broke, he said, lifeguards in wet suits brought the body 
up. 
</P>
<P>
A Police Department spokesman said the construction company was laying sections 
of the drainpipe when a backhoe drove over a buried 8-inch city water line 
above the storm drain. The backhoe was digging a trench where the drain pipe 
was to be laid. 
</P>
<P>
Police said a "rush of water" washed the worker down the pipe. "When he reached 
the bottom of the hill he was unable to get out of the drain pipe," an officer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
When the water main ruptured, much of the mud and sand around the opening of 
the storm drain washed down the pipe, along with pieces of wood and braces used 
for laying the pipe and sealing the 8-foot sections together. The construction 
workers had been at the site laying the pipe and putting in curbs for several 
weeks. The work was part of a city project to improve drainage from the top of 
the hill. 
</P>
<P>
Montero said Lopez had worked for the company for several months. Company 
officials were unavailable for comment. The coroner said Lopez is survived by 
his wife.

ARENA WILL INSTALL NEW SYSTEM TO CUT SOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Attorneys for the Pacific Amphitheatre agreed Wednesday to move ahead with a 
new digital sound system that marks their strongest proposal yet for confining 
noise and silencing the complaints of some Costa Mesa neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
The arena's attorneys laid out their plans in a closed meeting with Superior 
Court Judge Richard M. Beacom and the other players in the 6-year-old dispute. 
The judge endorsed the plan and refused a request by homeowners to resume a 
trial over the noise complaints, participants said. 
</P>
<P>
Area residents -- who have maintained that many rock concerts violate county 
noise standards -- will get their first chances to hear the results next month 
with appearances by country-rockers Alabama on April 7, heavy metal bands 
Poison and Tesla on April 8, and pop star Rod Stewart on April 14 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
Said Richard L. Spix, the attorney for the neighbors: "This has a greater 
potential to reduce noise levels than anything (the amphitheater operators) 
have proposed before. But this is a whole new system that hasn't really been 
tried much, so we'll just have to wait and see." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trial Resumption Proposed 
</P>
<P>
Even with the new system's potential, Spix suggested that the theater's plans 
to control noise could be undermined by technological uncertainties and by the 
practice of many bands to bring their own sound systems to concerts. "I'm still 
skeptical that it'll work." 
</P>
<P>
Out of such concerns, Spix proposed in court Wednesday that Beacom resume the 
civil trial for an injunction and other action against the arena's operators, a 
trial that started last year but was postponed to allow further settlement 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
But Beacom refused that motion, finding that amphitheater builder and operator 
Ned West Inc. had made good-faith attempts to negotiate the dispute with 
neighbors and to correct sound problems. 
</P>
<P>
And so the Ned West company plans now to contract with Audio Analysts Inc., a 
Plattsburgh, N.Y.-based firm that originated in Canada, to lease a new 
$180,000-a-year sound system to control noise levels. In all, arena operators 
said, the new system -- if successful -- would cost about $250,000 a year to 
operate. 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Lusk, a Costa Mesa resident who took the amphitheater operators to court 
6 years ago over the noise, said she was somewhat disappointed to learn that 
Judge Beacom had denied Spix's motion to resume the trial. 
</P>
<P>
But upon learning of Ned West's plans to try a new sound system, Lusk added: 
"That's all we care about. If they can do that, we don't need a trial. And even 
if they say it will take five or six concerts to get the bugs out, that's fine 
with me. All we want is some peace and quiet." 
</P>
<P>
Audio Analysts has employed a similar sound system at an outdoor facility near 
Toronto and at other locations over the last several years. But the system now 
being developed for Pacific Amphitheatre relies on a new technological 
component -- a higher digital resolution filter -- that has not been tested 
extensively, said Burt Pare, the firm's marketing vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Pare said in an interview that the new system sends out concentrated beams of 
sound whose direction can be more easily controlled than standard speaker 
systems. In addition to reducing noise outside the amphitheater, the system is 
aimed at better dispersing the sound within "so you don't kill everyone in the 
first row," Pare said. 
</P>
<P>
And at the same time, Pare maintained, the system retains or improves clarity. 
"It's like all of the sudden taking a cover off the speaker -- to make the 
sound brighter and more responsive." Audio Analysts plans to use about four 
dozen 1,000-watt speakers at the Pacific Amphitheatre, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ned West attorney Neil Papiano said: "There is no magic in this system. It's 
going to have to be tested and modified, and there's no instant cure. Nobody 
knows at this point how it's going to work." 
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the amphitheater operators were only installing the new 
sound system "as good neighbors," since they dispute claims by attorneys for 
the neighbors' association who say noise levels at concerts have consistently 
exceeded county limits. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys will return to court April 14 for a hearing and may then have 
preliminary results from the sound system's performance at the Alabama and 
Poison/Tesla concerts. If dissatisfied with the results, said attorney Spix, 
the homeowners will continue to push for a resumed trial or further legal 
remedy.

AFTER YEARS OF DENIALS, DYSON ADMITS MURDER CONSPIRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After saying for the last 4 years that an unknown intruder had killed her 
common-law husband at his Huntington Harbour home, Dixie Ann Dyson testified in 
a cold, flat voice Wednesday that she and her boyfriend planned the murder and 
hired another man to carry it out. 
</P>
<P>
Dyson, already convicted of first-degree murder in the slaying, is now the key 
witness against her former boyfriend, Enrico Vasquez, 32, and George Ira Lamb, 
27. Both are charged with murder and conspiracy in the death of Mel Dyson, who 
was found stabbed to death in the master bedroom of his condominium Nov. 18, 
1984, when he was 30. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez and Lamb were arrested in June in New York, soon after Dyson, now 45, 
began cooperating with authorities. 
</P>
<P>
At their preliminary hearing Wednesday in Westminster, Dyson told Municipal 
Judge Michael Beecher that the three killed Mel Dyson to collect $100,000 on a 
life insurance policy in which he had named Dixie Dyson as beneficiary. The 
amount was later determined to be about $135,000. 
</P>
<P>
Dyson said she and Vasquez talked about murder for nearly 2 years before it 
actually took place. 
</P>
<P>
"We discussed it, but I never thought it would materialize," Dyson said. "The 
whole thought grew very slowly. . . . Occasionally it was brought up, and then 
it became real." 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time Dyson has told her story in court about what happened 
that night. In many previous statements to police, she had said her husband was 
killed by a masked intruder, who then raped her and forced her to drive him to 
safety past security guards at the gated Huntington Harbour condominium 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Dyson spent the entire day on the witness stand, detailing how she and Vasquez 
began a sexual relationship after she separated from her husband in 1982, then 
waited until Vasquez could contact a hit man in New York before making final 
plans for the killing. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez, who came to court in a jump suit and hid his face from cameras, kept 
his head down as she testified, never looking at her. 
</P>
<P>
Lamb, whom Dyson has named as the actual killer, came to court in a dark suit 
decorated with a burgundy-colored pocket handkerchief and looked straight at 
cameras. In contrast with Vasquez, Lamb never took his eyes of Dyson while she 
was on the stand. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Dyson has been promised nothing in exchange for her testimony. 
But her sentencing date has now been postponed almost a year; lawyers involved 
acknowledged that she is hoping that her testimony will result in a reduced 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Dyson's physical appearance Wednesday contrasted sharply with her first 
courtroom appearance less than 3 years ago. She was then an attractive blond 
woman who had animated conversations with her attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, led to court in handcuffs and wearing jail clothes, she appeared 
much older, with gray hair, and seemed withdrawn. She could not read a simple 
money order placed before her, blaming deterioration of eyesight that has taken 
place in Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
She spoke clearly but without feeling. Her tone was the same when she described 
a night of Halloween trick-or-treating with her children as when she told the 
court about having sex with Mel Dyson then getting up to turn on the garage 
light -- a signal to the killer, she said, that her husband was now asleep. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Knew Each Other in N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Dyson testified that Lamb and Vasquez had known each other for years in New 
York and that Lamb had agreed to kill Mel Dyson for $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Lamb even agreed to wait until she could collect the insurance money to be paid 
his share, Dyson testified. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials have said Dyson's testimony Wednesday has cleared up 
one mystery: an Oct. 31, 1984, break-in at the Dysons' condominium. 
</P>
<P>
The police once believed that Dyson and whoever was in on the killing with her 
had staged the burglary to throw off police after the eventual killing. But 
Dyson testified Wednesday that she had taken Lamb to the condominium that day 
with plans to kill Mel Dyson when he arrived later. 
</P>
<P>
But she testified that Lamb later told her that he abandoned the plan when he 
saw someone else coming. Lamb decided to leave, Dyson testified, but faked a 
burglary first. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Dysons were separated, she and the couple's young son spent some 
weekends at Mel Dyson's Huntington Harbour home. 
</P>
<P>
Dyson testified that the conspirators planned to carry out the murder in the 
early morning hours of Nov. 18, 1984, when she, her son and a young cousin 
would be spending the night there. 
</P>
<P>
Dyson testified that about 6 p.m. on the night of the killing, she, Vasquez and 
Lamb met in a small shopping center at Golden West Street and Warner Avenue. 
Lamb got into the back seat of her car, then climbed into the trunk by 
unfastening a divider. 
</P>
<P>
Dyson said Vasquez "gave me a hug and told me good luck." After he got out, 
Dyson said, she drove past the security guard with Lamb hidden in the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
Dyson gave few details of the killing. Medical evidence shows that Mel Dyson 
was stabbed 27 times. Dyson told the court that she heard her husband give a 
low moan, then stand up and finally fall over. 
</P>
<P>
Lamb at first attacked her with an iron cord -- according to their prearranged 
plan -- so she could show police bruises from an attacker, she told the court, 
but then Lamb told her that he would prefer to rape her too. 
</P>
<P>
They had sex on the floor next to her husband's dead body, Dyson testified. 
</P>
<P>
Later, she sneaked Lamb by the guards by hiding him in the trunk again, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Dyson was asked whether she had loved Vasquez when they were planning the 
killing. "Yes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Do you love him now? she was asked. "No," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Dyson testified that she and Vasquez had talked about using the insurance money 
to start a business together. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked about spending it on our children, maybe taking a vacation, there 
were no definite plans," she said. 
</P>
<P>
(Vasquez has a young daughter, and Dyson has four children: her son by Mel 
Dyson, a daughter from a previous relationship and two older sons from an 
earlier marriage.) 
</P>
<P>
Dyson is scheduled to continue her testimony today. 
</P>
<P>
One sidelight of Wednesday's testimony is that the prosecutor who put her on 
the stand, and gently dragged the story from her, is Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard 
F. Toohey. He is the same prosecutor who won a first-degree murder conviction 
against her. 
</P>
<P>
During her trial a year ago, Toohey had told her in the courtroom during a 
recess: "One of these days, Dixie, you're going to tell us what happened."

CAMPBELL OUTSTRIPS COUNTY'S LEGISLATORS IN SPEAKING FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Private groups paid Sen. William Campbell $46,900 to speak to them in 1988, 
more than his taxpayer-paid salary and five times the amount received by any 
other lawmaker representing Orange County, according to his annual statement of 
economic interests. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, a Republican who represents a stretch of the county from Brea to 
Laguna Niguel, ranked behind only Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco) and Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) among 
lawmakers whose annual financial disclosures were filed Wednesday with the 
state Fair Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, who could not be reached for comment Wednesday, also reported 
receiving gifts valued at $5,534 and more than $10,000 in income to his spouse 
from a consulting firm that has produced Campbell's annual conference on women. 
</P>
<P>
State legislators are paid $40,816 a year, plus $88 per day in living expenses 
while the Legislature is in session. In 1988, lawmakers could receive unlimited 
gifts and speech-making fees but starting Jan. 1 were limited to $1,000 a year 
from each source. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spoke to 30 Groups 
</P>
<P>
Campbell spoke for money to 30 groups in 1988, receiving amounts as low as 
$150, from the United Domestic Workers of America, and as high as $5,000, from 
Friends of Lubavitch Inc. of New Orleans. His largest gift was a $3,140 trip in 
April funded by Pfizer Pharmaceuticals. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) finished a distant second to Campbell among 
Orange County lawmakers, collecting $8,400 for nine speeches. Among others, 
Seymour received money from the California Assn. of Hospitals and Health 
Systems, the California Medical Assn. and Johnson &amp; Johnson. His largest 
fee was $2,500 from the California Assn. of Realtors, a group for which Seymour 
once served as president. 
</P>
<P>
But Seymour's fees in 1988 were less than what he earned in 1987 and not even 
half of the amount he received in 1986. He attributed the drop to his lower 
profile since losing his post as chairman of the Senate Republican Caucus in 
May, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it has anything to do with John Seymour," he said. "If you can 
get the leader or a leader of any organization to speak, somehow that carries 
greater credibility than a member of the rank and file." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress) led the delegation in the value of gifts 
received with $18,017. More than $15,000 of that amount came in legal and 
accounting services from Santa Ana lawyer Lisa K. Hughes and from accountant 
Bruce Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
Allen Wednesday said the fees were in connection with her divorce last year 
after 21 years of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
"I paid some of it, and we negotiated the last part of it," Allen said. "She 
(Lisa Hughes) is a good Republican and wanted to do it for me. Part of it she 
just wrote off." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) received gifts valued at $14,954 in 
1988. Much of her total came in two privately funded trips to New Zealand and 
Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trip to Egypt 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson's $4,041 trip to New Zealand was financed by a consortium of 
industrial companies, including Atlantic Richfield, Chevron and Dow Chemical 
Co. While she was abroad, officials from Southern California Edison and 
Southern California Gas paid for some of Bergeson's meals. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson said the South Pacific trip focused on alternative energy sources, 
particularly geothermal energy and liquid natural gas, which she said is used 
extensively in the country's automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian trip, on which Bergeson was accompanied by her husband, Garth, was 
sponsored by the government of Egypt at a cost of $3,000. In addition, the 
California Optometric Assn. and the California Retailers Assn. picked up the 
tab for a $66 dinner the couple had in Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson said the trip to Africa was part of Egypt's effort to increase foreign 
investment in that country. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson was also paid $200 for a speech she never gave. The meeting she was 
scheduled to address was canceled, but the engineering company that sponsored 
the meeting, Guyer Santin Inc., paid her anyway for her "consideration in 
agreeing to speak." 
</P>
<P>
"I had a speech all prepared and then they called and canceled the meeting," 
Bergeson said. "They said they would have it later, but it never came about." 
</P>
<P>
At the low end of the scale, Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), who 
took office Dec. 5, reported receiving no gifts or speech-making fees. 
Assemblyman John R. Lewis (R-Orange), the only member of the delegation who has 
a personal policy against speaking for money, also reported no fees. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), who usually does not accept 
honorariums for speeches, said he decided to take a $1,000 payment from 
Farmers' Insurance Co. in 1988 and then use the money to reimburse his district 
office staff for the cost of their parking at luncheons and other local 
functions they attend. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to get into that thing where I'm selling myself as a politician 
to speak places," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

WOMAN SAYS DRIVER UTTERED CURSE AFTER KILLELEA WAS STRUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an emotional voice, a neighbor testified Wednesday that immediately after a 
Newport Beach woman was hit by a speeding car last September, the driver looked 
at the dying woman, then at the neighbor, and uttered an obscene curse. 
</P>
<P>
The neighbor testified in the second day of the murder trial of Danny David 
Ornelas, 19, of Huntington Park. 
</P>
<P>
In an opening statement on Tuesday, Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Goethals said he 
would show that Ornelas, although drunk at the time, deliberately steered a 
speeding car into Debbie Killelea as she stood in an alley behind her Balboa 
Peninsula home with two of her three children. And the prosecutor said the 
curse would be part of his proof. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Describes First Moments 
</P>
<P>
The neighbor, Gayle Orchard, described the first moments after the Sept. 1 
incident in her testimony Wednesday to an Orange County Superior Court jury in 
Westminster. She said she opened her garage door facing the alley at the rear 
of East Ocean Boulevard after hearing the crash. Her voice then broke as she 
described seeing Killelea's mangled body lying in the alley in front of her 
garage. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to believe it was my friend Debbie," Orchard said. "She was in 
rough shape. And there was a car overturned." Orchard said she then saw a man, 
whom she identified as Ornelas, climbing out of the car. 
</P>
<P>
"He was pulling himself out of the window on the driver's side," Orchard 
testified. "He looked at Debbie, and then he looked at me. And I didn't know 
which one he was directing it to, but he said, 'Goddamn ------- bitch.' " 
</P>
<P>
Orchard said she then raced to the telephone to call 911. 
</P>
<P>
According to other testimony Wednesday, Ornelas ran after climbing from the car 
and resisted arrest when he was found near the beach a short time later. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach Police Officer Glen Fisher told the jury that he arrived at the 
alley a few minutes after Killelea had been run over. He said the woman had 
suffered massive injuries but was still alive and conscious although unable to 
talk. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wore Agonized Looks 
</P>
<P>
About 10 friends and neighbors of Killelea who were in court wore agonized 
looks as Fisher gave a detailed account of the dying woman's condition. "Her 
left leg appeared to be severed above the knee," Fisher said. "Her right leg 
was twisted. Her arms were thrown back." The left side . . . of her face was 
also severely injured, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher said as he was trying to provide emergency aid to Killelea before the 
paramedics arrived, he asked her to make a sign if she could understand him. He 
added that she did make a sign that she could understand. 
</P>
<P>
"She rolled her eyes up and looked at me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, Killelea was rushed to Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and 
Medical Center, but she died during emergency surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher testified that police learned the identity of the driver, Ornelas, from 
a passenger in the car -- John Lozano, 18, of Huntington Park -- who had gone 
to the beach with Ornelas that day. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher said he drove off to try to find Ornelas and spotted him a short time 
later near Channel Road and East Ocean Boulevard. Fisher said he yelled at 
Ornelas to stop, but the young man began running. Fisher said he caught Ornelas 
on the beach and that Ornelas still tried to pull away and had to be subdued 
with a wristlock. 
</P>
<P>
In other testimony Wednesday, two eyewitnesses estimated that Ornelas was 
driving 50 m.p.h. up the alley just seconds before the car struck Killelea. A 
neighbor, Ray Farese, 29, said he saw the car going at that speed up the alley 
but did not see Killelea hit. 
</P>
<P>
Another neighbor, Tim Jessup, 20, testified that he saw the car going about 50 
m.p.h. and said the driver "swerved toward the lady" after Killelea put her 
hands on her hips in an apparent sign of disapproval at the car's speed. Jessup 
used a clock analogy to describe how the car veered right toward where Killelea 
stood. He said the car was heading straight as if toward 12 o'clock and then 
veered right to a 2 o'clock heading. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Ralph Bencangey, in cross-examination, noted that Jessup had 
said during the October preliminary hearing that the car had moved from 12 
o'clock to 1 o'clock. Jessup, after being shown a transcript of his October 
testimony, said: "It definitely was a swerve at an angle . . . maybe between 1 
and 2 o'clock." 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning from Bencangey, Farese and Jessup both acknowledged that they 
are not experts at estimating speeds. 
</P>
<P>
Bencangey, in his opening statement Tuesday, said that Ornelas was the driver 
of the car that fatally injured Killelea. But Bencangey said the defense will 
show that Ornelas should be tried for manslaughter and not murder. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said outside the courtroom that he is likely to show jurors 
today a videotape accidentally made by Lozano. The videotape shows Killelea 
trying to flee from the oncoming car, Goethals said.

BOOKSTORE CANCELS CONTRACT; 
</P>
<P>
MAN BLAMES FIRING ON RUSHDIE TRIBUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Steve Mellow knew he was taking a bit of a risk when he decided to include a 
brief tribute to author Salman Rushdie in a theatrical reading this Friday at a 
Costa Mesa bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
But Mellow said he never imagined that he would be fired by the bookstore 
chain. 
</P>
<P>
An official with Rizzoli Book Store in New York, which also owns Scribner 
stores, confirmed that it canceled its contract Wednesday with Mellow for his 
regular reading sessions at Scribner in the Crystal Court shopping mall in 
Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Rizzoli officials said Mellow was fired because the reading series, which began 
in October, failed to draw enough customers to make it worthwhile. Mellow 
contends that the firing was related to his plans to read a tribute to the 
author of "The Satanic Verses." 
</P>
<P>
A Rizzoli spokeswoman, however, insisted that the decision was unrelated to 
acts of violence that have occurred since Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini 
called upon Muslims last month to kill the Indian-born Rushdie for what they 
consider to be the novel's blasphemous offenses against Islam. The chain 
continues to stock "The Satanic Verses." 
</P>
<P>
Two Berkeley bookstores were firebombed Tuesday after the owner of one vowed to 
resist Islamic pressure to stop selling the book. 
</P>
<P>
Mellow, 52, of Santa Ana, said a Rizzoli executive told him, " 'You've breached 
the contract by endangering the public.' When I asked him if he really thought 
I had intentionally threatened the public's safety, he backed off very fast." 
Mellow would not say how much Scribner paid him under the contract. 
</P>
<P>
But Rizzoli spokeswoman Katherine Arnold insisted that the decision was "based 
on our inability to quantify the readership." It was difficult to calculate how 
many customers Mellow was attracting to the store with his dramatic readings, 
she said, compared to the more clear-cut response they would get from a 
newspaper advertisement. 
</P>
<P>
Scribner continues to stock "The Satanic Verses," although the Costa Mesa store 
was sold out. 
</P>
<P>
Mellow claimed that last week he "had been given the green light" to read an 
article by author Norman Mailer, published in the Los Angeles Times, in defense 
of Rushdie. Mellow said he had not intended to read from "The Satanic Verses" 
or from any of Rushdie's works. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a program on the theme of transformation that I had planned for 6 
months. I got the idea (for the Rushdie tribute) from reading the Mailer 
article and also from seeing a story in the New York Times with a picture 
saying something like 'His Life Transformed, Rushdie Is 'Bearing Up.' " 
</P>
<P>
The program, which Mellow said he still hopes to hold at another location 
Friday if he can find one, was to include selections from A.A. Milne's "The 
Tower of Pooh," poetry by E.E. Cummings, Ogden Nash and Sam Shepard, an excerpt 
from Carlos Castaneda's "Journey to Ixtlan," writings by Henry David Thoreau 
and "The Invisible Way" by Rashad Feild, which Mellow described as "a New Age 
love story." 
</P>
<P>
Mellow lists among his credits the creation of a children's television show, 
"The Looking Glass Revue," which he said aired in New York in the 1960s. He 
also said he produced two musicals in New York and wrote a children's book, 
"Help, I'm Trapped in This Book." 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Mellow has conducted 6-week workshops in dramatic reading for 
which he charges $50. Students are then included in public readings, which have 
been held in various locations.

3 MAKES TARGETED IN HUNTINGTON CAR THEFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A wave of thefts against Honda Preludes, Hyundai Excels and Toyota MR2s has 
prompted police in Huntington Beach to warn motorists to identify their car 
radios, stereos and other removable auto parts. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-five of these vehicles have been stolen so far this year in Huntington 
Beach, police said Wednesday. Most are recovered a day or two later but have 
been stripped of their seats and stereos. The Hyundais often are missing body 
parts and radios, while the Hondas and Toyotas are missing seats and radios. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the equipment is not marked, police say, making it difficult for 
authorities to identify stolen property when it is recovered. Police suggest 
that owners record serial numbers of their car stereo equipment and write their 
driver license number on the fabric of the seats with a laundry marker in an 
inconspicuous spot -- such as the leading edge of the cushion. 
</P>
<P>
Scratching the driver license number into the metal framework of the seats or 
radio case with an inscribing tool would be better still, police said. Car 
owners can arrange to borrow an electronic inscribing tool from the Huntington 
Beach Police Department by calling (714) 536-5933.

THE BEN JOHNSON STEROID INQUIRY; 
</P>
<P>
COACH: JOHNSON USED STEROIDS SINCE '81; 
</P>
<P>
REVELATIONS WORRY AGENTS AND PROMOTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The revelations on Wednesday of widespread drug use in track and field left 
those involved in the business side of the sport more than a little concerned. 
</P>
<P>
Promoters and agents said that the sport's image has been further tainted at 
the Canadian inquiry, in which Ben Johnson's coach has painted a bleak picture 
of extensive use of anabolic steroids. 
</P>
<P>
To what extent the sport has suffered, however, none would predict. 
</P>
<P>
"This has the potential of being as powerful as baseball's 1919 Chicago Black 
Sox scandal," said Chuck Galford, a road race promoter from Portland, Ore. "It 
has hurt the sport's image a lot. If it results in positive action in cleaning 
up the abuses, perhaps there will be a happy ending. Maybe it's time somebody 
stood up and spoke out." 
</P>
<P>
Galford echoed the hopes of the business community with interests in a sport 
whose image has been badly damaged, most recently at the Seoul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
There, Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson's urine sample tested positive for 
steroids after he had won the gold medal in the 100 meters. Johnson, the world 
record-holder, was stripped of his medal and has become the center of a 
national controversy. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government is conducting a special hearing at Toronto to determine 
the extent of abuses in the sport. The inquiry has focused on Johnson and his 
coach, Charlie Francis, among others. 
</P>
<P>
Francis' testimony Wednesday gave insight into the extent of the sport's 
steroid problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Ben Johnson showed us how close track and field was becoming to professional 
wrestling," said Alvin Chriss, an official of The Athletics Congress, the U.S. 
governing body for track and field. 
</P>
<P>
"What Charlie Francis said is not at all surprising. We can't say we knew it in 
a legal way that we can take action on it. But we knew it. 
</P>
<P>
"Ben Johnson's loss of a medal was an injury to the sport. We have realized in 
the TAC that if there is no more Ben Johnson, the sport has suffered a wound 
that may not heal, that will fester and grow worse." 
</P>
<P>
Drew Mearns, president of Heritage Group, a Cleveland sports promotion firm 
that represented Johnson, said the outcome may be an overall cleansing of the 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
Mearns, who encouraged Johnson to speak truthfully after his positive test, 
also thinks that the latest revelations may help Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"In a funny kind of way, it might help redeem Ben, that he is part of the 
system," Mearns said. "He is not one of 10 out of 15,000 Olympic athletes. He 
is one of 50%, 60% or 70%." 
</P>
<P>
But Mearns admitted that the message of seeing Ben Johnson win with steroids is 
ambiguous. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the message is that you have to cheat to win," he said. "The 
message is if you want to win and be good, you should do what Ben Johnson does 
. . . take vitamins or take steroids. You ought to use everything scientific, 
pharmacological and technological available to you. It is an unclear message." 
</P>
<P>
The message from track fans, however, may be more definitive. 
</P>
<P>
Indoor promoters lamented over decreased attendance at their events this 
winter, partly, they say, because of the Seoul drug scandal. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the fans read this stuff and say the heck with it," said Gordon 
Morris, a promoter of The Times/Eagle Indoor Games. 
</P>
<P>
Morris said the negative publicity makes it difficult to attract borderline 
fans. He also is concerned with attracting sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
"Sponsors would want to be associated with a nice and clean event," he said. 
"This is going to hurt track and field." 
</P>
<P>
However, Al Franken, promoter of the Sunkist meet in Los Angeles, said the 
steroid controversy will have no more effect on the sport than a cocaine arrest 
in the National Football League. 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly is a blemish," he said. "The people do equate steroids with 
cocaine and heroin, but the track people are pretty clean, considering other 
sports. Track and field is being singled out unfairly." 
</P>
<P>
Morris, on the other hand, said unlike a team sport, one individual's drug use 
can be damaging. "You can't get lost in the shuffle, like in a team sport," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
John Andreliunas, running promotions director for Reebok, predicted that shoe 
companies would be more prudent in sponsoring athletes. But he added that the 
sport will thrive despite the problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Track has to come clean and win back the respect," he said. "We worry about 
the image for sure. But something had to give." 
</P>
<P>
Galford, the Portland race promoter, said: "Track and field is a very pure type 
of event. The beauty of it is that it shows what human potential is. To have 
that tainted through the use of steroids or blood doping to enhance performance 
is a real slap in the face." 
</P>
<P>
Anita DeFrantz, president of the Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles and 
a member of the International Olympic Committee, said that although track is 
the premier sport of the Summer Games, its problems will not damage the Olympic 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the integrity of other athletes will pull through and perhaps lead the 
way," she said.

ATHLETES IMPLICATED IN INQUIRY PROTEST MIGHTILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Shock and outrage were the first reactions Wednesday from among those who were 
apparently implicated in performance-enhancing drug use by Canadian Coach 
Charlie Francis during a public hearing in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Francis, coach of banned Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, implicated seven 
current and former athletes in testimony before a Canadian board of inquiry 
into impropriety in sport. Francis said that he had either seen or been told by 
reliable sources that the athletes he discussed had used anabolic steroids. 
</P>
<P>
Among those implicated, although not specifically named, were: Florence 
Griffith Joyner, world record-holder at 100 and 200 meters; Evelyn Ashford, the 
former world record-holder at 100 meters; Pat Connolly, Ashford's former coach 
and herself a former U.S. Olympian; Jay Silvester, former discus world 
record-holder and currently a track coach at Brigham Young University; Chi 
Cheng of Taiwan, who held the world record in 100 and 200 in 1970, John Smith, 
who holds the world record at 440 yards and is the current track coach at UCLA 
and sprinter Andrea Lynch, a former British Olympian. 
</P>
<P>
Francis did not name them directly, but he described their achievements in such 
a way that they would be easily identified by anyone with a knowledge of the 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
Francis said he had actually seen only one athlete taking or even in possession 
of steroids, and that was before they were banned in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Francis said he was in the room of a New Zealand shotputter in the Olympic 
Village at Munich in 1972 and that "an American discus thrower who was also a 
world record-holder" came into the room and accepted a bottle filled with 
Dianabol pills. Francis added that "the discus thrower" took the bottle from 
the shotputter and left the room. 
</P>
<P>
Silvester was the world record-holder at the time. He could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Francis implicated Connolly, Ashford and Smith in a circuitous fashion. He 
testified that in 1979 "the world record-holder at 440 yards" (Smith) told him 
a prominent female coach who was also a former athlete (Connolly) had come to 
(Smith) asking for Dianabol to give to her prominent American female sprinter 
(Ashford). Francis said the sprinter subsequently showed great improvement. 
Smith could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, Ashford's time in the 100 went from 11.16 seconds to 10.97 and in the 
200 from 22.66 to 21.83. 
</P>
<P>
Connolly says the progress Ashford made that year was not unusual. 
</P>
<P>
Ashford, who together with Connolly, her former coach, has been one of the 
sport's leading anti-drug campaigners, said she thought that she was a target 
because of her outspokenness. 
</P>
<P>
"Because I'm speaking out is why he's attacking me," Ashford said Wednesday. 
"Maybe (Francis) thinks I'll stop. He can forget it. I'm not going to stop. The 
sport has a cancer on it and it has to be cut out." 
</P>
<P>
Connolly said she was angry at having her name "lumped in with the dirty 
sleazes (athletes who take drugs)," but said she was not surprised. She 
suspected that because of her high profile, a reference to her might come up. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, if I was in the least bit guilty, why would I stand up and point so many 
fingers?" Connolly said. "I'm not so stupid as to be a person who would do 
that. The users have to stand up and say everyone is using, to justify their 
own use. You could almost expect this. They have to take other people down with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people in the sport who are clean. They have been lumped in with the 
dirty sleazes, and I'm sick of it." 
</P>
<P>
Although Francis stopped short of saying that Griffith Joyner's world-record 
performances last summer and fall were the result of steroid use, he mentioned 
it in the context of performance-enhancing drugs. Francis used elaborate charts 
during his testimony to illustrate his contention that the world-record 
progressions in the 100 and 200 had been abnormally accelerated in recent 
years, because of drug use. 
</P>
<P>
"If you expect normal human endeavor, you have to go another 50 years to get to 
this point," Francis said, pointing to Griffith Joyner's 100 time of 10.49 at 
the top of the chart. "I don't think you can discuss this. This is what's going 
on. This is the international picture." 
</P>
<P>
Then Francis pointed to Griffith Joyner's time on the 200 chart. "Once again, 
you are looking at 40 to 50 years before this curve is expected," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith Joyner, who retired from track last Saturday, was unavailable for 
comment, but her agent, Gordon Baskin, strongly denied that the runner had used 
a banned substance. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is the truth and the truth will prevail -- Florence has never and 
will never use steroids," Baskin told the Associated Press from his office in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"She has gone through so many tests with the USOC, the TAC and the many 
governing bodies." 
</P>
<P>
Baskin said that after Johnson had tested positive in Seoul, there were rumors 
about other leading athletes, including Griffith Joyner. 
</P>
<P>
"The IOC thought it was so unfair that they made a specific announcement that 
Florence has never tested positive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ashford held the women's 100-meter world record at 10.79 before it was broken 
by Griffith Joyner. Connolly said that she was aware of rumors for some years 
that she had given drugs to Ashford. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want his dirt to get on me," Ashford said. "I tell you what, I think 
my reputation speaks for itself. I've been in the sport a long time and I 
intend to stay in it for another four years. I didn't think people who take 
drugs would last as long as I have." 
</P>
<P>
Connolly said that in that same year, 1979, Francis approached her at an indoor 
meet and offered to share information about which drugs were most effective and 
which of his athletes had success with which drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"He assumed Evelyn was using drugs," Connolly said. "I told him to get lost. 
His idea was that we could work together and beat the East Germans." 
</P>
<P>
Connolly said that she would be happy to testify under oath and with a 
polygraph regarding the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Ashford said that she has grown increasingly disenchanted with the state of the 
sport, so much that she would try to prevent her young daughter from getting 
into track.

"She won't get into it if we can't stop what's happening," Ashford said. 
"She'll play piano. People like Charlie Francis tell his athletes that Evelyn 
is on drugs, to get his athletes to take drugs. This is how he rationalizes 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Cheng was apparently implicated when Francis said he was told by two coaches 
that a "prominent Asian woman sprinter who competed in the United States and 
ran at a world-record level" was using drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Cheng is a four-term representative to the Taiwan national assembly and could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch, who attended Cal State Northridge, was also implicated by Francis, who 
testified that "one Canadian athlete indicated to me that his British-born wife 
who was among the world's fastest in the 100 meters . . he said she was given 
Dianabol by her British coach." 
</P>
<P>
Lynch, who was British, was married to Canadian Olympic runner Brian Saunders. 
She was seventh in the 100 at the 1976 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Francis also said that in 1978, three Canadian athletes attended Clemson 
University in South Carolina to compete on the track team and were each given a 
bottle of Dianabol and told to take one pill a day. Francis said the athletes 
didn't like the school and left.

QUINN SUES NOTRE DAME AFTER HE IS DISMISSED

<P>
A Notre Dame senior and former football player has gone to court to fight his 
dismissal from the university after a woman alleged he attempted to rape her, 
according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel M. Quinn, 21, of Encinitas, Calif., has sued Notre Dame for breach of 
contract. He filed a second suit Tuesday against the woman, a student at Saint 
Mary's College in South Bend, alleging slander. 
</P>
<P>
St. Joseph Circuit Court Judge Terry A. Crone denied Quinn's request Friday for 
a preliminary injunction to block his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick C. Doran, the university's assistant director for residence halls, 
ordered Quinn to leave his dormitory room and the campus by 5 p.m. last Friday, 
court documents show. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn was recruited by former coach Gerry Faust and was a reserve outside 
linebacker during the 1985 and 1986 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame sports information director John Heisler said Quinn was suspended 
from the university last spring for an undisclosed reason and was not permitted 
to return last fall. Quinn was permitted to re-enroll in January but was not on 
athletic scholarship, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In his suit against the female student, Quinn alleged the woman made untrue, 
slanderous claims when she told officials he attempted to have sex against her 
will and that he beat her and confined her, court documents show. No criminal 
charges have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
In the suit against Notre Dame, Quinn alleged breach of contract in that the 
university failed to allow him to complete his degree after signing him to an 
athletic scholarship. He asks the court to order Notre Dame to permit him to 
return and finish school.

THE BEN JOHNSON STEROID INQUIRY; 
</P>
<P>
FRANCIS WENT TO GREAT LENGTHS TO HELP HIS ATHLETES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
TORONTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although he had graduated from Stanford University five years before with a 
major in political science and a minor in history, Charlie Francis was a bored 
insurance underwriter in his native Toronto when he got the call in 1976 to 
help coach a suburban track and field club. 
</P>
<P>
Francis didn't have to think twice before accepting. A former sprinter who had 
competed for Canada at the 1972 Summer Olympics at Munich, he soon developed a 
reputation as a devoted mentor, who often dipped into his own pockets to pay 
his athletes' expenses, and an outstanding coach, who developed some of the 
world's best sprinters even though they worked out in a place they called the 
Pig Palace. 
</P>
<P>
He also became known in international circles as "Charlie the Chemist" because 
of his expertise in performance-enhancing drugs, particularly anabolic 
steroids. 
</P>
<P>
Francis, 40, displayed his depth of knowledge in that field Wednesday, 
testifying before the Canadian government's inquiry into international sport 
that he was instrumental in the drug use of 11 of his athletes, including Ben 
Johnson, world record-holder in the 100 meters. 
</P>
<P>
After winning the gold medal and setting a world record at the 1988 Summer 
Olympics in Seoul, Johnson was disqualified when he tested positive for an 
anabolic steroid. Since then, Francis has been suspended with pay from coaching 
by Sport Canada. 
</P>
<P>
In four hours of testimony Wednesday, exhaustive but never dull, Francis also 
implicated athletes from eight countries, primarily the United States. Even 
though rumors have been rampant for years about drug use in the sport, it was 
the first time that anyone with such a grasp of the issue has been so explicit 
in public. Not only were his comments on the record, he made them while under 
oath. 
</P>
<P>
Track and field may never entirely recover. 
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday, his first day of testimony, a portrait was presented of a man 
who has so much passion for the sport that he quit his insurance job in 1978 to 
become a full-time, albeit unpaid, coach for the Scarborough Optimists Track 
and Field Club. Even though it was the Toronto area's most successful 
organization for youth sports, the athletes had no place to train except for 
the Swine Pavilion -- "the Pig Palace" -- on the grounds of Canada's National 
Exhibition, near the home stadium of the Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
To support himself, Francis sold his Aston-Martin and, at 30, moved back in 
with his parents. 
</P>
<P>
Most of that type information was supplied by the inquiry's co-counsel, Robert 
P. Armstrong, who said that he had to prod Francis for it. Reporters kidded 
Armstrong afterward that he was creating another St. Francis. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong said that Francis often footed at least half the bill for the club's 
annual tours. Because most of the young athletes were poor, the majority having 
immigrated from the West Indies, Francis also sometimes had to make sure they 
were properly fed. 
</P>
<P>
"The boyfriend of one of our girls told me that she was eating Fruit Loops for 
dinner," Francis said after he was asked by Armstrong to tell the story. 
"Obviously, that had to stop. I went out and bought them some groceries." 
</P>
<P>
He recalled another occasion when Johnson and his older brother, Eddie, had 
only $6 between them for a three-day trip. Upon discovering that when they 
asked for one order of french fries to share at the first meal, he gave them 
money. 
</P>
<P>
A few years later, after he began receiving a $25,000 annual salary as a 
national coach from Sport Canada and Sport Ontario, Francis said he still 
refused to take a percentage of his athletes' earnings, although several of 
them were beginning to emerge as world-class runners. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed kind of pathetic to take a fee and then give it back to them the 
next time they needed a meal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was only after he acquired an agent for Johnson and other athletes in 1985 
that Francis said he accepted a cut, a one-time payment of $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
During Wednesday's testimony, the lengths that Francis would go to help his 
athletes gain recognition as world-class became further apparent. He introduced 
many of them to performance-enhancing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he first learned of anabolic steroids from other athletes at 
Stanford from 1967-71. Francis, whose hand-timed 10.1 in the 100 meters in 1970 
was tied for fifth-fastest in the world, said that he competed drug-free 
through 1972, when he represented Canada in the Summer Olympics. He was 
eliminated in the quarterfinals of the 100 meters because of a leg injury, but 
he said his eyes were opened. 
</P>
<P>
"Rumors in Munich were that the level of use among top-level (track and field 
athletes) was 80%," Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, when he won his second national championship in the 100, he said that 
he was assisted by the most popular anabolic steroid of the day, Dianabol. 
</P>
<P>
"During that period, I was working, and it was very difficult for me to 
maintain a proper training program," he said. "To get myself back to a world 
level, I became actively interested in steroids and where I could obtain them 
for myself." 
</P>
<P>
A doctor prescribed the Dianabol, which Francis said he used for three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost weight, and I gained muscle mass," he said. "I felt generally improved. 
I felt more confident. The emotional effect was apparent. Physically, I felt 
much better leading into that championship." 
</P>
<P>
He said that he felt no adverse side effects from the steroid use. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his confidence in the drugs, particularly after some of his athletes, 
especially Johnson, began to show extraordinary results with no discernible 
side effects, Francis said that he still believed he needed additional 
firsthand knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
He said that when the physician used by most of the athletes, Dr. Jamie 
Astaphan, prescribed a new steroid for them in 1986, Francis also asked for a 
prescription. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to know the effect of it," he said. "I was getting back into shape. 
My weightlifting improved quite rapidly. I went from a bench press of 200 
pounds to 320 within five weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the suspension, his future in coaching is in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
But his immediate future is determined. He could be asked to testify through 
the middle of next week.

An Oklahoma horseman filed a $4.6 million federal lawsuit Wednesday claiming 
fraud in the 1987 All American Futurity because the winning horse in the 
$2-million New Mexico race was drugged. 
</P>
<P>
The New Mexico Racing Commission ruled in January 1988 that Elans Special, the 
first filly to win the race in 10 years, was drugged twice before the All 
American Futurity, considered the Kentucky Derby of quarter horse racing. 
</P>
<P>
Doyle Rice, owner of second-place finisher Elaina Rae, asks in the suit filed 
in U.S. District Court in Tulsa, Okla. that Elans Special be disqualified as 
the winner and his horse receive the title.

RANDOLPH SILENT ON ALLEGED YANKEE DRINKING

<P>
So, Rickey Henderson says the New York Yankees had a drinking problem? 
</P>
<P>
That's OK with Willie Randolph. For the first time in 14 seasons in the big 
leagues, the Yankees aren't his problem anymore. Let Steve Sax pass out the 
straws to stir the drinks. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care to comment about that," Randolph said Wednesday when asked to 
respond to Henderson's published comments that the Yankees had an alcohol 
problem, especially on team flights, which inspired the New York Post to call 
them "The Bronx Boozers." 
</P>
<P>
"It's no concern of mine," Randolph said. "After being with the Yankees and now 
coming over here, I'm not involved with what's going on over there. That's not 
where my head is at." 
</P>
<P>
Randolph was the Yankees' captain, and even when it was suggested that 
Henderson implicated him with his comments, the second baseman still refused to 
be drawn in. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess everyone's implicated," Randolph said. "But I don't think I have to 
defend my reputation." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers reached contract terms with outfielder Mike Devereaux and pitcher 
Ramon Martinez Wednesday, leaving pitchers Tim Belcher and Tim Crews as the 
only unsigned players on the big league roster. Belcher is seeking more than 
the $212,000 that the Dodgers signed Orel Hershiser for in his second season, 
and Crews is believed to be seeking a contract in the $150,000 range.

IT'S STILL HAIRY FOR BLYLEVEN, WHO YIELDS HOMER TO FIRST BATTER HE FACES

<P>
They have been trademarks for Bert Blyleven for years -- the home run pitch and 
the bright red beard -- and as of Wednesday afternoon, both remained intact. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven holds the major league record for home runs allowed in a single season 
-- 50 in 1986 -- and it didn't take long for his reputation to catch up with 
him at Gene Autry Park. In the first inning of his first intra-squad game, 
Blyleven hung a 0-and-2 breaking ball to the first batter he faced and Dante 
Bichette hit it into a ditch well beyond the 365-foot sign in left field. 
</P>
<P>
"It was windy out there," Blyleven deadpanned. "Windy as hell. In a normal 
ballpark, that would have held -- except, maybe, Minnesota." 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven immediately burst out laughing. Few parks this side of Yellowstone 
would have held Bichette's blast. 
</P>
<P>
"A little hanging sidearm breaking ball," Blyleven said. "I'm going to put that 
away for a while. It's not ready to come out yet." 
</P>
<P>
So Blyleven can still give up the long ball. Some things simply transcend 
trades and uniform changes. 
</P>
<P>
But he came close to losing the beard he has worn for more than a decade, 
requiring the vote of his teammates to preserve it. 
</P>
<P>
"I was informed by Mrs. Autry that Mr. Autry didn't like facial hair," Blyleven 
said. "I offered to sit down with them and explain the reasons why I had it. 
Like I told the players, I'm not here to buck the system -- I just feel 
comfortable with it. And, I keep it clean-shaven." 
</P>
<P>
But the issue proved more hairy than that. Blyleven eventually had to take his 
case to Angel Manager Doug Rader and Angel Vice President Mike Port, where a 
compromise was struck. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me that if I held a team meeting . . . and if the players did not 
object . . . and if other players would promise not to grow beards of their 
own, then I could keep it," Blyleven said. 
</P>
<P>
The players voted to keep Bert and the beard a tandem. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not what you look like, it's what you do between the lines that counts," 
Blyleven said. 
</P>
<P>
And, he added, his beard is there to improve the team's appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"What's behind this beard, nobody wants to see," Blyleven joked. "There's just 
an ugly man under this beard." 
</P>
<P>
Mark McLemore figures to open the exhibition season as the Angels' leadoff 
hitter, almost by default. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Downing, Rader's No. 1 choice as leadoff man, has been bothered by the 
rib-cage injury that plagued him through much of the 1988 season and will miss 
this weekend's trip to Yuma, where the Angels will play three games against the 
San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Ray, McLemore's rival in the team's second base derby, strained his 
right hamstring during running drills Wednesday and has also been scratched 
from the Yuma trip. Ray's injury is not considered serious, but Rader is 
beginning to worry about Downing's. 
</P>
<P>
"If Brian is healthy, the general consensus of the (coaching) staff is that 
we'd be best with him leading off," Rader said. "But he's had a problem with 
his side, the same thing he had last year, and he hasn't made that much 
progress." 
</P>
<P>
Six Angels remain unsigned and, with Mike Port's Friday deadline at hand, 
center fielder Devon White believes he's headed for an automatic contract 
renewal. "That's what happened last year -- and the year before that," White 
said. "This is pretty much the same thing. It's been a source of aggravation." 
</P>
<P>
Port renewed White's contract in both 1987 and 1988, but kept negotiating with 
White beyond the deadline last spring and reached a one-year, $185,000 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
This spring, after winning a Gold Glove in 1988, White is seeking a salary in 
the range of fellow third-year veteran Kevin Seitzer of Kansas City. Seitzer 
recently signed a one-year contract for $340,000.

MORALES TOSSES HIMSELF INTO THE HAMMER THROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two years ago, Mike Morales found a new sport . . . literally. 
</P>
<P>
He was rummaging around in the oversized shed that serves as the 
equipment/weight room for UC Irvine's track team when he came across a 
dismantled hammer. That's hammer, as in the kind they sling in the Olympics, 
not the nail-driving variety. 
</P>
<P>
But it might as well have been a construction tool for all the expertise 
Irvine's coaching staff had on the subject. When Morales began teaching himself 
how to throw the thing, he was holding it in the wrong hand. No one at Irvine 
noticed. 
</P>
<P>
Morales, however, is not easily detered, and takes to new sports like ducks 
switching ponds. He lettered in varsity tennis as a freshman at Garden Grove 
High School, switched to track and taught himself to throw the discus as a 
junior and was an All-Garden Grove League offensive tackle in football. 
</P>
<P>
"I found the hammer and went out and started throwing it," he said. "I knew we 
didn't have anyone in the event and we were losing points at meets, so I 
figured what the heck. 
</P>
<P>
"I was over in the cage throwing it when (Coach Vince O'Boyle) walked over. At 
first I thought he was going to yell something like, 'Hey, quit tearing holes 
in the dirt, one of my runners could get hurt in a divot,' but he just watched 
and then left." 
</P>
<P>
Morales took that as a sign of approval, so he continued his one-man quest to 
learn the intricacies of hammer throwing. 
</P>
<P>
"I got tapes of Olympic hammer throwers from other athletes," Morales said. "I 
talked to other athletes and other coaches after meets. And I videotaped myself 
. . . whenever I could. Most of the time, I couldn't find a coach, or even 
another athlete, to run the camera. . . . The field events aren't too big 
around here." 
</P>
<P>
O'Boyle admits that Morales was "neglected" in the hammer, but only because no 
one on his staff had the knowledge to instruct him in anything but the basics. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Morales made remarkable improvements. As a sophomore last year, he 
finished second in the Big West Conference championships in the event with a 
school-record throw of 197 feet 5 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, he eclipsed that record, flinging the hammer 199-6 during the Long 
Beach Relays, less than three feet short of qualifying for the National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. championships. His distance in the event has improved 
31 feet since his freshman year at Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't hard to stay motivated, even though I wasn't getting much support," 
Morales said. "Every day, I'd throw it a little farther and that kept me 
going." 
</P>
<P>
These days, Morales is getting help. John Frazier, a shotputter who graduated 
from UCLA in 1986 and competed in the Olympic Trials last summer, is a 
part-time assistant coach working with Irvine's throwers. 
</P>
<P>
After a bit of head-knocking, Frazier and Morales are becoming a team. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike's never had a coach before and all through the fall we fought, mostly 
about technique," Frazier said. "Plus, we're close in age and it's my first 
year coaching, so we both had a lot to learn. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, he knows where I'm coming from and I understand him. Now, we're working 
together." 
</P>
<P>
Morales had been getting along pretty well without help. He'd never had a 
discus coach in high school and was fourth in the event in the Big West meet 
last season. And he was beginning to hammer out the fine points of the hammer 
by himself too. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd always done things my own way," Morales said, "and there were conflicts in 
the beginning. But John has really helped me. Now, I know I'm practicing the 
correct technique. And he's very knowledgeable about (weight)lifting. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, when you work out by yourself, there's a tendency to do too much. John 
has helped me learn when to quit so I can peak for meets." 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, he's got someone to push the record button on the video 
camera. 
</P>
<P>
Frazier, who has an upper body that would make Arnold Schwarzenegger proud, is 
excited about Morales' potential because his protege has plenty of room for 
improvement in the strength department. 
</P>
<P>
"When we show up at meets, people always ask if Mike's a decathlete," Frazier 
said, "but he's going to keep getting bigger and stronger. 
</P>
<P>
"If Mike keeps progressing, he should score at the NCAAs this year. I think 
he's one of the top young hammer throwers coming up. Getting that (personal 
best) so early in the year is a good indication of how well he's coming along." 
</P>
<P>
Morales sees his lack of strength as just another avenue for improvement. It's 
certainly an obstacle he has dealt with before. At Garden Grove High School, he 
was a 6-foot, 180-pound tackle who used "quickness and wits" to get by. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't too good. I think we won two games in my junior and senior years," 
he said. "A lot of nights, you'd look at the guy across the line of scrimmage 
and decide your main goal was just to survive." 
</P>
<P>
Morales, who has gained 10 pounds since last year and now weighs 215, says he 
gets a kick out "beating the hulks," which happens almost every time he wins an 
event. 
</P>
<P>
"Just about everyone I compete against is stronger than me," Morales said, "and 
I think that bodes well for the future. I'm happy the way things have 
progressed. This is an event you can do for a long time. . . . Just look at the 
guys who are 40 and older who have done so well in the throwing events. 
</P>
<P>
"And you don't have to be huge. The world record holder (the Soviet Union's 
Yuri Sedykh at 284-7) is a little Russian guy with a bald spot. He doesn't look 
like much, he just throws the hammer 100 feet farther than everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
O'Boyle, of course, will be happy if Morales throws the hammer an inch farther 
than everyone else for a couple of seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike did a great job last year, but he's only scraping the surface," O'Boyle 
said. "I think he'll be throwing all the implements a long way this year." 
</P>
<P>
A week ago, when the men's basketball team was a four-game home sweep away from 
second place in the Big West, Coach Bill Mulligan's goal of making the top six 
seemed almost a cinch. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, Irvine could win its final two games and still have to play 
Wednesday night in the tournament's qualifying round, which pits the 
seventh-place finisher against No. 10 and No. 8 against No. 9. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine is 8-8 and in seventh place in the conference. Cal State Fullerton and 
Utah State are tied for fifth at 9-7. Cal State Long Beach and UC Santa Barbara 
are tied for third at 10-7. 
</P>
<P>
It's still possible for Irvine, Fullerton, Long Beach, Santa Barbara and Utah 
State to end up 10-8 and tied for third. In that case, Santa Barbara would be 
seeded third, Fullerton fourth, Utah State fifth, Long Beach sixth and Irvine 
seventh. 
</P>
<P>
There's also the possibility of a four-way tie for fifth with Irvine, 
Fullerton, Utah State and Fresno State all finishing 9-9. That would mean 
Irvine would be seeded fifth, Fullerton sixth, Fresno seventh and Utah State 
eighth. 
</P>
<P>
All of which all means it's possible Irvine would be better off to finish 9-9 
than 10-8. 
</P>
<P>
Go figure. 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan was a vocal proponent of last season's rule change that eliminated 
point differential as a method of determining Big West tournament seeding in 
the event of ties. 
</P>
<P>
Point differential encourages running up the score in blowouts and most coaches 
were against it. 
</P>
<P>
The first criteria is still head-to-head competition and, in the event of 
multiple-team ties, the combined records against each other are used. 
</P>
<P>
In the four-way tie scenario, for instance, Irvine would be 4-2 against the 
group and get the fifth seed. Utah State would be 2-4 and get the eighth seed. 
</P>
<P>
In the possible five-way tie for third, Santa Barbara would be 5-3 against the 
group, Irvine would be 3-5 and everyone else would be 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
The second criteria, for the 4-4 teams, is record against the Big West's 
toughest opponents. In the five-way tie, Fullerton would get the No. 4 seed 
behind Santa Barbara because the Titans beat Nevada Las Vegas, which will 
finish first in the standings. Utah State has two victories over New Mexico 
State (which would finish in second place), so Utah State would get the fifth 
seed. Long Beach would be No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan's response when informed of these possibilities? 
</P>
<P>
"Wow." 
</P>
<P>
Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
The men's tennis team took second in the International Tennis Coaches Assn. 
National Team Indoor Championships, losing to No. 4-ranked California, 5-3, in 
the championship match Sunday. Irvine, ranked seventh in the nation, beat No. 
17 Pepperdine in the first round and picked up its first ever win over USC (No. 
12) in the second round. The Anteaters beat No. 8 South Carolina in the 
semifinals. "It was one of those rare, beautiful moments in a coach's 
lifetime," said Coach Greg Patton, who's never prone to understatement. "We 
were just a handshake and a smile away from beating them and we played without 
(Mike) Briggs." Patton was so excited about the victory over USC, he shaved his 
mustache. Irvine went into the competition with a 2-4 record, but the losses 
had come to the Nos. 1, 2, 6 and 10 teams in the country and all were on the 
road. "As experienced and talented as this team is, I wanted to make them 
humble," Patton said of the tough schedule. "We learned some humility and we 
were tired of taking lumps. We called it 'Redemption Week.' " 
</P>
<P>
Coach Bill Mulligan wants to stay out of Wednesday night's Big West tournament 
qualifying games because he thinks "it's almost impossible to win four straight 
in that tourney." But he doesn't care which team Irvine plays. "I don't give a 
damn," he said, "because I don't think there's anyone we can't beat. Of course, 
there's no one we can't lose to, either." 
</P>
<P>
The men's swimming team took second in the Big West Conference championships 
Sunday, the highest finish in school history. Anteater swimmers set seven 
school records during the meet. Junior Brian Pajer won the 100-yard 
breaststroke in 55.51 seconds, a school record, and the 200-yard breaststroke. 
Pajer has won both breaststroke events in all three conference meets in which 
he has competed. . . . Mulligan on sophomore power forward Ricky Butler: "He's 
by far the smartest player on the team. Hands down. He sees the defense. He 
doesn't make mistakes." Mulligan said he wants Butler to take 20 shots a game. 
In his past four games, Butler has averaged about 11 shots. . . . Mulligan on 
tonight's 8:30 ESPN game against Utah State, which will be the first national 
broadcast out of the Bren Center: "It's really nice. My relatives (in Chicago) 
can watch us, if they can stay up until 10:30 at night."

FULLERTON DEFEATS SADDLEBACK IN ORANGE EMPIRE SOFTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kristin Jacobs pitched a three-hitter as Fullerton College's softball team 
defeated Saddleback, 1-0, Wednesday in the Orange Empire Conference opener for 
both schools at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs (8-4) struck out nine and didn't walk a batter. 
</P>
<P>
Tammy Rodriguez led off the ninth with an infield single. She went to second on 
a passed ball and was sacrificed to third. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez then scored on a squeeze bunt by Kelly Hilliard. 
</P>
<P>
In other Orange Empire Conference play: 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago 7, Orange Coast 1 -- Natalie Sanchez threw a two-hitter for 
Rancho Santiago (8-5, 1-0) at Orange. Sanchez (8-4) struck out two and walked 
one. She allowed only a fifth-inning run. The Dons took the lead in the third 
with three runs. Kim Wolf had a two-run single in the inning. Heather Illsley 
had two hits and scored three runs and Judy Padialla had three hits and one RBI 
for the Dons. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West 2, Riverside 0 -- Golden West scored single runs in the second and 
the seventh at Riverside. Tammie Flores (3-3) gave up only two hits for Golden 
West (7-4 overall, 1-0 in conference). Riverside is 0-1 in conference. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange Empire Conference women's swimming: 
</P>
<P>
Cypress 80, Saddleback 50 -- Sami Teofilo and Laurel Strother each won two 
events to lead the Chargers (2-0 in conference) at home. Teofilo won the 
100-yard freestyle in 57.65 seconds and the 200 freestyle in 2:03.39. Strother 
won the 50 backstroke in 33.40 and 100 backstroke in 1:12.46. Saddleback is 1-1

THE CLOSER THEY GET, THE HARDER IT IS FOR ABDUL-JABBAR TO TAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a scene early in "Stardust Memories," a Woody Allen movie dealing with 
the underside of fame in our society, in which the audience is given a glimpse 
at the way a celebrated, but jaded, film maker views his public. 
</P>
<P>
Stepping out of a limousine, the character played by Allen is swarmed by 
admirers who are made to look ridiculous and even a bit scary by the use of 
extreme close-up shots with a wide-angle lens. There are relentless autograph 
hounds, misguided girls propositioning him, a hideous-looking woman caked in 
makeup wanting to enlist his help in some obscure fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
That must be the way Kareem Abdul-Jabbar sometimes sees the sporting public, 
which often disregards decorum and the Laker center's privacy simply for a few 
empty moments of attention. In the movie, Allen's character never shoved a 
camera back in the face of an annoying fan, though the motivation clearly 
seemed to be there. 
</P>
<P>
Real life can be more harsh, however, and Abdul-Jabbar on Tuesday was convicted 
of a misdemeanor offense for doing just that to an Italian tourist toting a 
video camera in a Phoenix shopping mall last April. 
</P>
<P>
On the videotape, shown Tuesday night by one local television station, we see a 
crude black-and-white tape of Abdul-Jabbar cruising the shops in a white 
T-shirt and sweat pants. Even though the tape is fuzzy and amateurish, we can 
see that Abdul-Jabbar is annoyed. Eventually, he moves closer and swats away 
the camera, as if shooing away a fly. 
</P>
<P>
For this, Abdul-Jabbar now faces a fine of as much as $1,750 and the remote 
possibility of a jail term for misdemeanor assault. 
</P>
<P>
The scene after the verdict was handed down stretched irony to an extreme. 
Leaving the courthouse, the tourist was besieged by media representatives, some 
of whom toting mini-cams. Fernando Nicolia obviously savored his moment of 
fame, and his victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important, because he has to realize that he's just like anybody else 
when it comes to the law," Nicolia told an interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the man missed the point. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar is not a normal citizen. How many times have you been followed by 
someone wanting to videotape you at your local mall? Some of us even feel a bit 
threatened when we see ourselves on a video scanner at a neighborhood 
convenience store. 
</P>
<P>
Being a public figure, of course, Abdul-Jabbar has certain responsibilities. He 
earns $3 million a season in a most public profession, and thus must expect a 
severe reduction of a private life. 
</P>
<P>
On his farewell tour, which resumes next week, Abdul-Jabbar has sort of struck 
an unspoken bargain with his admirers. They honor him with gifts and genuine 
praise, and he responds by being accessible and open during press conferences 
that seem the same in every city, and by making speeches to the fans. It has 
gone without a hitch, and Abdul-Jabbar sometimes even seems to be enjoying it 
all. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, though, he does not have to tolerate blatant intrusions into his 
privacy. Tuesday, when a reporter called him at home for a comment on the 
court's verdict, he hung up without saying a word. Although Abdul-Jabbar's 
phone manners may be questionable, not commenting was his prerogative. 
</P>
<P>
Life also imitated art during a recent incident at the Sacramento airport, 
stirring images of "Stardust Memories." 
</P>
<P>
Waiting to board an early morning flight to Salt Lake City, a middle-aged man 
and woman sat in a corner of the boarding area, he furtively smoking a 
cigarette in a non-smoking area and she reading a paperback. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, the Lakers arrived and sat, as a group, as far from the 
crowd as possible. Abdul-Jabbar, however, walked to a bank of telephones to 
place a call. 
</P>
<P>
The woman pawed through her bag, pulled out a camera and dragged her partner 
out of his seat. While Abdul-Jabbar leaned against a support and talked on the 
phone, the woman sidled not two feet from him and instructed her husband to 
take a snapshot. 
</P>
<P>
The photograph was snapped -- without incident, by the way -- and Abdul-Jabbar 
did not miss a beat in his phone conversation. 
</P>
<P>
The incident made one observer cherish his anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Later that day, walking a quarter-mile from a press conference at the Salt 
Palace to the team's hotel, Abdul-Jabbar was besieged by autograph seekers. He 
obliged many, but then another strange event took place. 
</P>
<P>
A car skidded along the snow-packed streets and stopped. A door was flung open 
and a man jumped out and ran toward Abdul-Jabbar. He thrust a pen and paper in 
front of Abdul-Jabbar and requested an autograph for his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"We just got married," the man said, out of breath. 
</P>
<P>
"Congratulations," Abdul-Jabbar said, flatly. 
</P>
<P>
Then, he kept walking, refusing to sign. 
</P>
<P>
Those familiar with the case in Phoenix snicker when the subject of a jail term 
for Abdul-Jabbar is brought up. After all, the tourist was not seriously 
injured -- no facial disfigurement was apparent during his TV sound bit, at 
least -- although his video camera was damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Most likely, when the penalty is imposed later this month, Abdul-Jabbar will be 
fined and perhaps required to do some community service. 
</P>
<P>
But in a broader sense, he has long been a prisoner of fame. When the Lakers 
travel to Phoenix, there is little to do on a day off except walk from the 
hotel to the Metrocenter Mall, where the incident took place, or across the 
street to a few restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
After last April's incident, however, Abdul-Jabbar may feel confined to his 
room, the only escapes being room service, cable movies and the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
So, in a way, Abdul-Jabbar already has done his time in solitary, and 
retirement will be his parole. 
</P>
<P>
Given last year's incident in Phoenix and the constant public intrusions, it is 
not surprising that Abdul-Jabbar has talked in his various farewell press 
conferences of his desire to spend retirement on a deserted beach somewhere, 
reading a book and sipping a cool drink. 
</P>
<P>
Suggested reading for Abdul-Jabbar might be Walker Percy's novel, "The 
Moviegoer," which, in part, deals with the public's fascination with 
celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
In one passage, Percy writes of a fictional sighting of actor William Holden on 
the streets on New Orleans: 
</P>
<P>
"I am attracted to movie stars but not for the usual reasons. I have no desire 
to speak to Holden or get his autograph. It is their peculiar reality which 
astounds me. The Yankee boy is well aware of it, even though he pretends to 
ignore Holden. Clearly, he would like nothing better than to take Holden over 
to his fraternity house in the most casual way. 'Bill, I want you to meet Phil. 
Phil, Bill Holden,' he would say and then go sauntering off in the best 
seafaring style."

AFTER TRAGEDY, SPRATT QUIETLY CARRIES ON FOR CORONA DEL MAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brian Spratt of Corona del Mar High School had just finished the most 
successful season of his aspiring athletic career. 
</P>
<P>
Spratt had helped Corona del Mar's sophomore basketball team complete the 
1986-87 season with a 19-0 record. The Sea Kings' closest game was 19 points. 
It was a time of celebration, and the players looked forward to the school's 
awards ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
It was also the best of times for Spratt's father, Lt. Daniel Spratt, commander 
of the Orange County Sheriff's Academy. The elder Spratt had just put the 
finishing touches on a new rifle range in Orange and eagerly looked forward to 
the opening ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
But on Feb. 20, the day the range opened, Spratt, a 21-year veteran of the 
department, began complaining of intense headaches. He underwent surgery the 
next day to remove a blood cot in the right side of his brain. 
</P>
<P>
Five days later, Dan Spratt, 41, died. 
</P>
<P>
"He was never sick a day in his life," said his widow, Tina Spratt. "It was a 
tremendous blow to the entire family." 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Tina Spratt was left to raise two stepsons on her late husband's 
retirement fund. She sold her home in Newport Beach and moved to Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"The boys were very quiet," she said. "I wasn't sure how Brian would react. He 
went to the awards banquet and all the other fathers were there with their 
sons. He really missed his father at the banquet. 
</P>
<P>
"They used to talk after his games, and Dan would critique his play. Brian 
really looked up to his father. He's had to do a lot of growing up over the 
past two years." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Spratt still shows little emotion when he talks about his father, which 
isn't very often. 
</P>
<P>
"He's come up to me after games a couple of times and said, 'I wish my Dad 
could have seen this game,' " Tina Spratt said. 
</P>
<P>
Spratt has played four outstanding games in Corona del Mar's drive for the 
Southern Section 3-A division championship. Corona del Mar (19-9) will play 
Trabuco Hills (21-6) at 2:30 p.m. Saturday in the Sports Arena for the title. 
</P>
<P>
Spratt, a 6-foot-5 center, has been the team's leading scorer in postseason 
play, averaging 20 points in four games. He averaged only seven points per game 
in regular-season play. 
</P>
<P>
Spratt is a tough defender inside who generally guards an opponent's tallest 
player. He is a good rebounder and an accurate shooter to 15 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Spratt has no specific explanation for his sudden scoring success in the 
playoffs, saying only, "I'm more intense in the playoffs. When I hear talk that 
team is better than us, I get psyched up." 
</P>
<P>
True to his word, Spratt scored 22 points in a 69-63 upset over top-seeded 
Rolling Hills in the quarterfinals and had 21 points in a 57-56 overtime 
victory over third-seeded Morningside. 
</P>
<P>
"Morningside was a sweet win because they had this reputation of being a 
run-and-gun team and we shut them down," Spratt said. 
</P>
<P>
Spratt admitted he gets very nervous before playing, but added he settles down 
once he jumps for the center tipoff. 
</P>
<P>
"I think getting nervous helps me play better," he said. "I don't know why, but 
I can't sit still before a game. I was real nervous before our first (playoff) 
game with El Dorado, but since then, I've felt we're on a roll and can't be 
beat. 
</P>
<P>
"The El Dorado game was the turning point in our season. When we beat them 
(61-43), you could see the confidence grow. Our defense and controlling the 
tempo has been the big difference in the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar has defeated four teams -- El Dorado, Laguna Hills, Rolling 
Hills and Morningside -- which played up-tempo games. Corona del Mar has given 
up an average of only 55.7 points in the playoffs with its pressure man-to-man 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been times when I got so bored repeating so many defensive drills 
here," Spratt said. "We still do one-on-one full-court drills every day. But 
our defense has gotten us to the finals, and hopefully, our defense will win us 
the championship." 
</P>
<P>
Said Tina Spratt: "He's trying so hard to win the championship. I look back 
over the past two years, and I'm often amazed how much he's grown up. The one 
thing I've learned is that our children are very resilient. Life goes on for 
everyone."

TIME, TITLES HELP BAUSCH ENJOY LIFE AT KATELLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has been a slow, often painful, learning process but Barb Bausch is finally 
getting the hang of this coaching business. 
</P>
<P>
She now can look at a videotape and watch herself coaching the Katella High 
School girls' basketball team without cringing. There was a time when it would 
have been a little like listening to one's own voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Is that really me? 
</P>
<P>
 Bausch had it in her mind that she could become a darn good coach someday. She 
had been a hard-working player at Esperanza High School and Fullerton College. 
She knew the game. There didn't seem to be any reason she couldn't be just as 
successful as a coach. 
</P>
<P>
Friends -- other coaches, who steered her into the profession in the first 
place -- were convinced she could too. 
</P>
<P>
But there was this little question of confidence that gnawed at Bausch last 
season, her first as Katella's head coach. 
</P>
<P>
She has had to overcome a youthful appearance, the shadow of the previous coach 
and her own doubts, but finally she has proven to herself that she has become a 
good coach. 
</P>
<P>
Her team plays Muir for the Southern Section 4-A championship at 6:30 tonight 
at Chapman College. 
</P>
<P>
That alone is enough to lift Bausch from the ranks of the novice coach, where 
she floundered for most of her first season, to the assured veteran who will 
sit on the Katella bench tonight. 
</P>
<P>
A great deal has changed since the day last season Bausch, now 24, was nearly 
kicked out of the school's mail room by a suspicious administrator. 
</P>
<P>
"A woman said, 'What are you doing?' " Bausch said. "I said, 'Oh, just picking 
up some mail.' She said, 'Don't you think you better let your teacher do that?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
It took a little explaining, but Bausch convinced the woman she was indeed the 
girls' basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
These days, she can't sit on a bench near the gym for more than a few moments 
without a teacher or a student stopping by to chat for a while. 
</P>
<P>
"She's really been accepted by the kids, the faculty and the administration," 
said Tom Danley, the boys' basketball coach and athletic director for 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
It took time before anyone would let her forget she was not Mickey McAulay, 
former coach and savior of girls' basketball at Katella. And that stung Bausch 
more than any loss in her first season. 
</P>
<P>
"I fought that all year, but by the end of the season I was more in control," 
Bausch said. "The last game of the season I finally felt the players were 
really listening to me." 
</P>
<P>
McAulay's first season in 1983-84, Katella was 1-19. But before she left in 
1987 to become an assistant to Darlene May at Cal Poly Pomona, the Knights had 
reached the Southern Section 3-A championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Bausch inherited a talented group of players from that team, including Joni 
Easterly, a Times' All-County guard last season. But Bausch struggled to gain 
her own identity. Only now, after proving herself beyond a shadow of a doubt, 
has she carved her own niche. 
</P>
<P>
"No one paid any attention to us when I coached," said McAulay, who hired 
Bausch as an assistant three seasons ago. "Barb is under a microscope." 
</P>
<P>
After McAulay led the Knights to the title game in 1987, a winning tradition 
had been established. Bausch coached the team to the Empire League title last 
season, but it lost in the second round of the 3-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Bausch called McAulay often last season for advice. 
</P>
<P>
"Mickey didn't give me answers," Bausch said. "She threw my questions back at 
me. She helped me along in the right direction and made me understand it 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
It prepared her for this season, which has gone more smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
Katella again won the Empire League title. Easterly was named the league's most 
valuable player and has signed a letter of intent to play at USC next season. 
</P>
<P>
And Katella is in the championship game tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"I really feel good about myself," Bausch said. "It's really told me, 'Yeah, I 
can do this.' I can feel the confidence coming on."

LOCAL SHOPPERS SPLIT OVER SEARS' EFFORT AT LOW-PRICE CONSISTENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER JR. and KIMBERLY L. JACKSON, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 300 customers had clustered at the entrances to South Coast Plaza's Sears 
store Wednesday afternoon, awaiting that magic moment when doors would burst 
open and prices would fall. 
</P>
<P>
Once inside the store, serious shoppers found Sears new everyday low-price 
strategy to be a mixed bag. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Schwarzenbach of Tustin, for one, said the reductions unveiled Wednesday 
fell far short of making her pulse race. As Schwarzenbach sorted through the 
racks, she lamented that the more fashionable offerings in the girl's 
department were only a dollar less than the department store's old prices. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Keller, on the other hand, said the new prices were great. 
</P>
<P>
"I've done really well," said the Fountain Valley man, who had already loaded 
up on "personal items" from the men's department. 
</P>
<P>
Schwarzenbach and Keller were among shoppers across the United States who 
flocked to Sears, the nation's largest retailer, after the chain reduced prices 
on more than 50,000 items in its 824 stores. The stores were closed from 6 p.m. 
Monday to noon Wednesday to give employees a chance to change price tags and 
signs and prepare for the introduction of the "everyday low prices" approach. 
</P>
<P>
The move came in response to competition from discounters as well as complaints 
from consumers that frequent price changes have made it difficult for shoppers 
to recognize a fair deal. As part of the new strategy, Sears says it will offer 
fewer special sales and instead will provide dependable prices. 
</P>
<P>
While most Southern California shoppers interviewed Wednesday said Sears' new 
discount prices were generally lower than before, many weren't convinced that 
they were the best deals in town. 
</P>
<P>
"Prices don't look that low to me," said Phil Bernard, a computer programmer 
from Topanga, as he looked over some blue jeans. "These are $19.95. I've seen 
them for $14 or $15 at other places." 
</P>
<P>
The prices on blue jeans seemed more reasonable to James J. Pittman, a 
bartender from Beverly Hills who grabbed two pairs. And Teresa Lee, after 
spotting a video camera at the Sears Santa Monica store whose price, she said, 
was more than $100 less than what she paid at another store, was even more 
impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"I was skeptical about these discount prices," said Lee, a 22-year-old legal 
secretary. "I usually wait for a sale. But I'm amazed at the low prices today. 
And it's good knowing I can come back again some other day and get the item for 
the same price." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Harbeson, 42, of Corona del Mar, said the prices were lower on a lot of the 
tools he had seen but not on the router he needed. Though he wasn't able to 
take advantage of the new low prices, "it seems to be an improvement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The new emphasis on discount pricing was accomplished at Sears stores without 
the "warehouse look" some retailers favor. Although Sears employees were 
dressed in festive hats and aprons, the stores were little changed. 
</P>
<P>
Sears officials generally said late Wednesday afternoon that it was too early 
to tell whether the new strategy was getting off to a successful start. 
</P>
<P>
But Jim Berry, manager of the Sears store at the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza, 
said he was pleased. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that the response, at least in terms of shoppers in the store, was 
overwhelming. When we opened, we had crowds of people at all the entrances. I 
don't think anybody went away disappointed." 
</P>

'BREWPUBS' ARE SPILLING INTO NEW TERRITORIES

There is an hour wait on weekends for a table at the 140-seat restaurant of the 
Great Lakes Brewing Co. as patrons jam the bar to guzzle European-style beer 
brewed on the premises. 
</P>
<P>
"We're brewing around the clock and selling it as fast as we make it," said 
Daniel Conway, 27, who owns the bar with his brother, Patrick. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers restored the tavern -- Cleveland's first -- last September and 
started brewing beer, part of a growing nationwide brewing trend as local 
brewers apply their craft in "brewpubs" and "microbreweries," offering a 
variety of beers to local clientele. 
</P>
<P>
Great Lakes patrons can choose from three different brews at $2.20 a glass with 
names such as Eliot's Amber, named for Eliot Ness, who frequented the bar and 
ran for mayor of Cleveland before gaining fame as a lawman, Daniel Conway said. 
</P>
<P>
Brewer Thaine Johnson, who worked for Cleveland's former Christian Schmidt 
Brewing Co., was persuaded to come out of retirement and apply his skills on a 
smaller scale. 
</P>
<P>
Great Lakes can brew 750 to 1,000 31-gallon barrels of beer a year, a typical 
amount for brewpubs that offer beer for on-premise consumption. 
</P>
<P>
Microbreweries brew and bottle beer for regional consumption. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Monica, the City of Angels Brewing Co., which operates a 250-seat 
restaurant in a revamped furniture store, hopes to offer its ale both for 
consumption on the premises and for carry-out. 
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping to offer people small plastic, resealable kegs so people can 
take it home," said bar manager Jim Lucitt, adding that the brewpub has 
attracted a number of celebrities since it opened a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael Keaton stops in every now and then. Wilt Chamberlain was in the other 
night and Magic (Johnson) stops by," Lucitt said. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of 1986, there were only 29 microbreweries -- breweries which 
produce less than 15,000 barrels a year -- and brewpubs in North America, 
according to the Assn. of Brewers in Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the number has doubled each year. At the start of 1989, there were 
120 brewpubs and microbreweries operating in North America, said Charlie 
Papazian, who founded the association in 1978 and edits the association's 
magazine, Zymurgy, named for the branch of chemistry dealing with fermentation. 
</P>
<P>
At the Rooster Court Bar and Grill in Northampton, Mass., patrons can try a 
brown ale named Old Brown Dog or, in the summer, a light wheat beer, said Peter 
Egelston, a co-owner of the brewpub. 
</P>
<P>
"The novelty of the beer is enough to bring people in the first time, but not 
enough to bring them back," Egelston said. 
</P>
<P>
In Hartford, Conn., The Chester Fife &amp; Drum Corps will help usher in 
Connecticut's new brew Feb. 1 when John Foley, president of the Connecticut 
Brewing Co., rolls out the first barrel of Nathan Hale Lager. 
</P>
<P>
Foley, 26, developed his interest in beer at the University of Notre Dame where 
he reviewed the history of brewing for a seminar. 
</P>
<P>
After graduation, he worked in New York in investment banking but continued to 
study the market for beer and, after raising $500,000, founded the brewing 
company, basing his beer on a recipe that dates to Colonial America. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a renaissance back to pre-Prohibition days when Manhattan had over 100 
breweries," Foley said. "There were 4,000 breweries in the United States in 
1870 but by 1980, there were only 40."

THE HIGH-PROFILE SOCIALITE IN JOHN TOWER'S LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE MANSFIELD and PHIL McCOMBS, Washington Post Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most Cabinet designates bring one thing to their confirmation hearings: a good 
lawyer. John Tower, in the words of one friend, "brought a blonde." 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Heyser, 63-year-old wealthy Dallas socialite, has been Tower's constant 
companion since their first date, Jan. 25, 1986. She has been married three 
times, is said to have been a Hollywood starlet who once dated Clark Gable and 
is credited with injecting new pizazz into Tower's personality, described by 
one friend as "stuffy." 
</P>
<P>
She calls him "sweet peach." He calls her "dumpling." 
</P>
<P>
But although friends say Heyser may be the best thing to have happened to the 
twice-divorced defense secretary-designate, her presence at his confirmation 
hearings is being privately criticized. Several of Tower's hometown friends 
warned him not to bring Heyser to the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing 
room, but he ignored their advice. According to Martha Kirkendall, a longtime 
Tower assistant who now resides in Dallas, Heyser responded: "Everybody in 
Washington knows we go together. Why shouldn't I be there?" 
</P>
<P>
Not only did Heyser's presence remind the Senate panel that Tower -- saddled 
with allegations of "womanizing" -- was not a married man, but her highly 
visible profile in Women's Wear Daily was said to be more Nancy Reagan than 
Barbara Bush. "It was a disaster," one Tower adviser said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Others disagreed. "Dorothy is very much a lady," says one Washington socialite 
and friend. "She's no blonde bimbo." 
</P>
<P>
Now the couple are ensconced in adjoining rooms at the Jefferson Hotel, waiting 
out the storm. They are said to be avoiding the social scene, dining quietly 
with friends such as Rose Narva, managing director of the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Hamon, longtime Dallas friend and supporter of Tower, said Tuesday: "He 
needs her companionship and her support. I think John is very much in love with 
her." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, at one crucial point in the hearings, Tower playfully reached under the 
table during lunch at the Jefferson one afternoon and said, "I'm going to 
fondle you now." 
</P>
<P>
Heyser -- who hobnobs with other socialites and European royalty -- has a 
wicked sense of humor as well. "She teases him," Kirkendall says. "She keeps 
him on an even keel." 
</P>
<P>
"She is much older than she looks," Hamon said. "She takes very good care of 
herself." 
</P>
<P>
According to friends, Dorothy Gordon came from "modest means." She was born in 
Tulsa, the youngest of three children. Her parents died while she was still in 
high school. As a young woman, she left Oklahoma and went to the West Coast, 
where she appeared in a few films. Friends say she had a small role in "Artists 
and Models" (1955) opposite Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin. 
</P>
<P>
She married Jerry Huber and had one son, Jack. She married again, but friends 
are hazy on the details. She moved to Dallas. A third marriage, to Estill 
Heyser, a founder and past chairman of the board of the Bank of Dallas, ended 
in 1983 with his death. He was said to be an alcoholic. "She's very sensitive 
to the problem," Kirkendall says. "She certainly doesn't want to go through it 
again." While Heyser likes to drink socially, "she can take it or leave it," 
according to Kirkendall. 
</P>
<P>
Friends say Heyser -- who was not looking for another husband -- met Tower in 
the fall of 1985, but didn't date him until the following January. Tower's 
first wife, Lou, is also a friend of Heyser. "She's been very supportive of Lou 
Tower," Kirkendall says. "That's been a wonderful relationship. She helped heal 
the wounds" from Tower's second marriage to Lilla Burt Cummings. 
</P>
<P>
During the inauguration, when asked about Tower's alleged drinking problem, 
Heyser told a reporter, "He doesn't have a drinking problem. Everybody should 
have that kind of problem that he doesn't have." And she laughed. 
</P>
<P>
"She's tough," Kirkendall says. "She's very secure. I've never found any weak 
spot in her or any kind of vulnerability. She can really laugh at a lot of 
these things. She's not easily impressed with the trappings of power." 
</P>
<P>
A snazzy dresser, Heyser is given to wearing red velvet strapless dresses with 
dangling fur tips and is said to be extremely health conscious. 
</P>
<P>
One mutual friend says Tower and Heyser have a lot in common. They both have 
condos in the fashionable Turtle Creek area of Dallas and will return there if 
he is rejected for the Cabinet post. They are both tough and are both short. 
"She doesn't tower over him like a lot of women would," one Washington friend 
says.

If you're an Orange County rock music fan who would like more opportunities to 
see major nightclub concerts, you owe a debt of gratitude to the Laguna Beach 
City Council for saving you from your own most self-destructive instincts. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the council's unanimous vote last week denying Club Postnuclear 
permission to sell beer, there will be fewer shows in the county tempting you 
to risk your neck for rock 'n' roll. Without beer sales, there are likely to be 
few, if any, major live attractions at Postnuclear to risk your neck for, given 
the economics of running a concert club. 
</P>
<P>
This is how the five Laguna Beach council members see you, the rock fan who 
might patronize Club Postnuclear: 
</P>
<P>
If you are over 21, you will guzzle too much beer, drive onto treacherous 
Laguna Canyon Road (the club is at 775 Laguna Canyon Road) and wrap your car 
around the nearest utility pole. 
</P>
<P>
If you fall into the 18-and-over, college-age bracket that Postnuclear also 
admits, the council assumes that you will filch drinks illegally and meet the 
same fate as your elders. Even if you obey the law and don't drink, you will 
somehow be corrupted by all the drinking going on around you. 
</P>
<P>
"The canyon road, alcohol and youth do not mix," was Mayor Robert F. Gentry's 
pithy summation before the council voted to cut off Postnuclear's potential to 
become a first-rate, major-league rock club. 
</P>
<P>
What the council members did not say is that alcohol, youth and the canyon road 
already mix routinely in Laguna Beach, which so far has not re-enacted 
Prohibition. Every day, bars, restaurants, grocery stores and liquor shops 
throughout Laguna Beach -- and elsewhere in Orange County -- sell alcoholic 
drinks to people who travel on Laguna Canyon Road, the coastal city's main link 
to the freeways. 
</P>
<P>
There was no council motion last week to revoke their right to dispense alcohol 
or to remove the beer and wine concession from the popular Sawdust Festival, an 
all-ages event that sets up shop each summer on Laguna Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
If the Laguna City Council is right, perhaps other government bodies should 
play Big Brother and force the Celebrity Theatre, Anaheim Stadium, the Coach 
House, Irvine Meadows, Pacific Amphitheatre, South Coast Repertory and the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center to dry up before they wreak more death and 
destruction on the community. All of these major arts and entertainment venues 
admit patrons under 21 while serving alcoholic beverages. 
</P>
<P>
Thus singled out for wanting to do what so many others are already doing, it is 
not surprising that Club Postnuclear's owner, William (Max) Nee, is feeling 
like a scapegoat these days. 
</P>
<P>
Nee, in fact, is not a Spuds MacKenzie kind of guy. When the wealthy real 
estate investor opened Postnuclear in the summer, he did it with a no-alcohol, 
no-smoking policy. 
</P>
<P>
Nee thought that if he could make the club sufficiently comfortable and 
attractive, it would draw a crowd without smoke and alcohol and set an 
enlightened new precedent for the nightclub industry. 
</P>
<P>
Nee thought wrong. As time went on, it became apparent that to succeed with 
live, original rock, Postnuclear would need an adult clientele in addition to 
college-age audiences -- and that those adults would want a beer during the 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
Nee has proposed to sell beer with unusual care. Drinkers would first have to 
show identification and receive a glow-in-the-dark wristband. Nee promised to 
add staff members and to train them how to serve alcohol responsibly, slowing 
or cutting service to those showing signs of becoming drunk. 
</P>
<P>
He also pledged to serve free non-alcoholic drinks to "designated drivers" who 
agree to abstain while others in their party drink beer. Furthermore, he 
promised to stop beer sales and start dispensing free coffee a half hour before 
closing. If all that failed to keep patrons sober, he proposed to send tipsy 
people home in a cab, with Postnuclear picking up part of the fare. 
</P>
<P>
It was pointed out to the council that if Nee failed to live up to his pledges, 
or if problems arose, officials could simply revoke his beer permit. 
</P>
<P>
Not good enough. 
</P>
<P>
All of this elicited not a single question, not one specific comment or 
substantive observation, from any member of the City Council during the Feb. 21 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Nee, who is of Chinese extraction, wondered whether he might have 
been the victim of "subtle racism." 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a jury in the South in the '60s," he said this week. "They already 
know you're guilty. It's just a matter of going through the procedures. The 
evidence was never heard or discussed, or even acknowledged." 
</P>
<P>
Gentry denied this week that racism had entered into it. "Ethnic considerations 
were not at all a part of our decision," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But if racial discrimination is not involved here, cultural discrimination 
surely is. 
</P>
<P>
What makes Club Postnuclear suspect to the City Council is not just the sale of 
beer, it's the 499-capacity club's aim of promoting adventurous, new rock music 
on a major scale. For a substantial segment of the county community, that means 
cultural enrichment. 
</P>
<P>
But for the powers that be (and on the Laguna Beach City Council the powers 
average 52 years old), rock is something foreign and not easily controlled, 
something that signifies rebellion. Its sound is unruly; its messages challenge 
many of the conventions and beliefs of the county's burgher elite, for whom 
quiet, tidy affluence is the ideal. 
</P>
<P>
This was the vision of Laguna Beach that Gentry, an associate dean of students 
at UC Irvine, set forth in an interview last year: "Our city has always 
attracted non-traditional people, independent thinkers who wanted a different 
quality of life. We're not just another suburb, but a real town with a very 
unique character." 
</P>
<P>
On a short list of independent thinkers whom Postnuclear has brought to Laguna 
Beach in recent months, you find Jamaican Joe Higgs, a pioneer of reggae music; 
Canadian Lillian Allen, respected for her socially conscious poems set to 
reggae, and Scotsman Steve Bronski, a leader in the musical expression of gay 
pride and dignity. 
</P>
<P>
Given a chance to thrive, Club Postnuclear might have continued bringing 
vibrant, unusual examples of rock culture to Laguna Beach. But the City 
Council, like so much of Orange County officialdom, seems content to let the 
community remain just another suburb. 
</P>
<P>
Sleep tight, tidy burghers. Don't let the rock fiends bite.

WILLARD SCOTT WEATHERS THE STORM AFTER GUMBEL'S 'TODAY' MEMO 
</P>

<P>
NBC weatherman Willard Scott indirectly joked on the "Today" show Wednesday 
about a Bryant Gumbel memo that sharply criticized him, but said off the air 
that the morning-show host's remarks had "cut like a knife." 
</P>
<P>
"I feel so sorry that it happened," he added in an interview, referring to a 
published report Tuesday that disclosed Gumbel's 5-month-old memo, which had 
been intended as a private one for "Today" executive producer Marty Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Scott said, off-camera problems he and Gumbel had last year had 
been resolved before the memo became public. Written last September in response 
to a request from Ryan for Gumbel's thoughts on the program, the memo 
criticized many aspects of the "Today" show, including Scott and several other 
on-air personalities. 
</P>
<P>
Scott said he'd known for years that Gumbel "didn't think my act was much," but 
added that he and Gumbel actually had been getting along well for the last two 
months. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged being stung by the criticism in Gumbel's memo, which charged 
that Scott holds the show hostage "to his assortment of whims, wishes, 
birthdays and bad taste." 
</P>
<P>
"It cut like a knife," said Scott, who has been part of the "Today" show since 
March, 1980. Gumbel arrived in January, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the normally jovial weatherman said, he fears that "almost nobody" will 
believe he and Gumbel actually have the rapport they show on the air. 
</P>
<P>
"But there's nothing I can do. . . . We'll just have to wait and see what 
happens," he said. He said he hadn't talked with Gumbel about the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Gumbel was on vacation this week and not available for comment, a network 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever Scott's private hurt, it wasn't apparent on Wednesday's broadcast, 
save for joking allusions to the memo and the furor over it. 
</P>
<P>
Those were delivered with his hearty, rapid-fire manner, as was his salute 
during the two-hour program to a total of five female viewers who had reached 
100 years of age or older. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the broadcast, in alluding to the Gumbel memo, he noted that "March in 
some places is coming in like a lamb . . . but in other places, it's coming in 
like a lion, like at 30 Rock." He meant NBC headquarters at 30 Rockefeller 
Plaza here. 
</P>
<P>
Scott also quipped that "my audition tape is out," and later held up a copy of 
Wednesday's USA Today newspaper -- but didn't say that it contained an essay by 
TV critic Monica Collins that praised him. 
</P>
<P>
The uproar over the disclosure of Gumbel's memo seemed to affect co-anchor Jane 
Pauley briefly on Wednesday's show. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, discussing an upcoming segment on life-saving dogs, asked her: "What if 
the dog comes up and grabs you by the arm and takes you over to CBS?" 
</P>
<P>
"I won't fight it," she replied off-handedly. 
</P>
<P>
But in an interview after the show, she said her remark was only in jest. 
"There's no significance to it. There's less there than meets the ear." 
</P>
<P>
Pauley, who didn't come in for criticism from Gumbel, readily admitted that 
"some people are hurt" by the memo, which NBC News President Michael Gartner on 
Tuesday said was "ancient history" that someone had stolen from Gumbel's office 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think feelings can be mended, and after a while we'll be all right," 
Pauley said. "But it's not a pretty thing." 
</P>
<P>
Those looking for a possible on-air discussion of the matter by Scott and 
Gumbel when the latter returns to work Monday will have to wait. 
</P>
<P>
A "Today" spokesman said that Scott is taking a week's vacation -- planned well 
before this week's events -- next week. Al Roker, weatherman for NBC-owned 
WNBC-TV here, will fill in for Scott. 
</P>
<P>
When Scott returns from vacation on March 13, he will do the "Today" weather 
reports from Washington, the spokesman said. Not until the next day, March 14, 
will the two be in the studio together for the first time since the memo's 
publication. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Friedman, who was executive producer of "Today" until last June, said 
Wednesday of Gumbel's memo: "I'm more apt to agree (with NBC) that it's 
history. . . . The only thing I would say is that when they put the computer 
system into NBC, I never got one and never used it. 
</P>
<P>
"And now I know why."

'DREAM STREET' UP THEIR ALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
HOBOKEN, N.J. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The show's production office is atop an aging seven-story building housing such 
other enterprises as the Hoboken Health Club, Choices in Cardiology and Cogent 
Information Systems, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to headquarters for the makers of NBC's "Dream Street," a coming 
dramatic series about the lives of young blue-collar men and women in this 
venerable, hard-nosed waterfront town of 42,500, right across the Hudson River 
from Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
The show's executive producers, Marshall Herskovitz and Edward Zwick, created 
ABC's Emmy Award-winning "thirtysomething," which inspects the travails of the 
upwardly mobile Cuisinart generation each week. 
</P>
<P>
Their association with "Street" has caused some speculation that the new 
one-hour series, which is being filmed entirely in Hoboken, is but the 
working-class edition of ABC's venture. 
</P>
<P>
Such talk ticks off Mark Rosner, who created and is producing "Dream Street," 
which will premiere at an as yet unspecified date this spring. Six episodes 
have been ordered thus far. 
</P>
<P>
"The NBC people say stuff like 'thirtysomething' and I really hate that," said 
Rosner, a short, intense native of suburban Valley Stream, N.Y., who was head 
writer and co-producer of NBC's "Crime Story." 
</P>
<P>
"I try to discourage them because it's unfair" to both shows, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The series stars relative unknowns: Dale Midkiff and Peter Frechette as 
brothers and Thomas Calabro as Midkiff's best friend, who works for a local 
mobster doing "errands." 
</P>
<P>
Rosner is a USC film school graduate whose friendship with executive producer 
Zwick goes back to their student days together at the American Film Institute. 
The genesis of the show, he said, "is that NBC wanted to do something young, 
blue-collar and sexy. That was how it was related to me. And the catch phrases 
of '501 jeans' and 'Bruce Springsteen' were bandied about." 
</P>
<P>
A major difference between "thirtysomething" and "Dream Street," he submits, is 
that in his show, "because the characters are younger and because the 
neighborhood is much rougher, everyday life has many highs and lows. There are 
more life-and-death issues." 
</P>
<P>
That was the case in the '50s classic "On the Waterfront," which also was 
filmed in Hoboken -- once a gritty, ugly industrial and shipping town that 
later went into a period of decay. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Hoboken now is enjoying a revival of sorts, yuppyized to some 
degree by the "thirtysomething" crowd lured away from Manhattan by lower rents, 
old tenement buildings ripe for renovation and things like country kitchens. 
The City is only a five-minute train ride away. 
</P>
<P>
But more than enough of the old Hoboken remains to provide the working-class 
look for "Dream Street," which has only two standing sets -- a warehouse and a 
bar. It films its home and apartment scenes inside the homes and apartments of 
local residents. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Los Angeles, where location filming is so common that some citizens 
would like to see it made a felony, the reaction of Hobokeners to "Street" on 
their streets seems to be mild puzzlement. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody quite knows who we are yet," said co-producer Brooke Kennedy, a New 
Yorker with a good Irish laugh. She previously worked in Miami for a year as 
production manager on "Miami Vice." 
</P>
<P>
"They're not quite sure if we're just another film that came in," she said. 
"Nobody quite understands that we're theirs, just like 'Vice' was Miami's." 
</P>
<P>
The proximity of Manhattan has allowed producer Rosner to cast the show from a 
large and ready-to-work pool of New York stage actors, as does CBS' New 
York-based "The Equalizer." 
</P>
<P>
Although not all still call New York home, most of the 12 regulars in "Dream 
Street" either got their start on the New York stage or have done time there. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like having a gun with 12 cylinders," Rosner said. "Anyone I go to can 
carry the weight." 
</P>
<P>
His troupe is distinctive in several respects. 
</P>
<P>
Two players -- Charles Brown and Debra Mooney -- were in Pulitzer Prize-winning 
plays in New York, Brown in "A Soldier's Play" and "Fences," and Mooney 
opposite Judd Hirsch in "Tally's Folly." 
</P>
<P>
And Brown and Frechette currently are working two jobs -- on Broadway by night, 
in Hoboken by day. Brown is in Neil Simon's hit "Rumors" and Frechette is in 
"Eastern Standard." 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who plays a warehouse foreman and friend of Frechette's father in "Dream 
Street," hasn't worked much in television. He said he's been fortunate -- 
"knock on wood" -- to find regular work in theater. 
</P>
<P>
"This is almost a whole new ballgame, and I'm finding that out rapidly," he 
said on a recent chilly morning. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm used to playing (before) 1,200 people a night, and the first thing I keep 
finding I have to do here is curtail my projection, to pull it back and let the 
camera do it for me." 
</P>
<P>
He stood near a space burner, trying to warm himself, inside an old, very cold, 
concrete-floor warehouse filled with fan belts, copper tubing, dust-covered 
generator engines and a crew assembled to film a tense scene with him and 
actors Frechette and Midkiff. 
</P>
<P>
It truly is glamorous, this TV business, laughed Frechette, who plays the 
oldest brother in a working-class family, his character a perpetual loser 
always seeking the easy dollar. 
</P>
<P>
The actor, whose stage credits range from Chekhov to a recent off-Broadway 
revival of the musical "Flora, the Red Menance," calls Los Angeles home now. He 
moved there in 1981 from New York when he landed a lead role in the film sequel 
to "Grease." 
</P>
<P>
Now he sublets a New York apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Mooney, who plays Frechette's mother, calls the series akin to "three dreams 
come true -- because you have good people, good scripts and it's here." 
</P>
<P>
Like many actors who began here, Mooney once went West. Unlike many such 
actors, she did not stay there and amuse herself by denouncing Hollywood and 
generally being what they call a patriotic New Yorker. 
</P>
<P>
No, she sublet her Los Angeles apartment and moved back to New York in 1979 for 
Neil Simon's "Chapter Two" on Broadway. She later was in the female version of 
his "The Odd Couple" that co-starred Sally Struthers. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't been tempted to move back," she said in a phone interview. But she 
won't take a New York stage job while working "Dream Street." 
</P>
<P>
"I have forsaken the poor old theater for this," Mooney mock-sighed. "I didn't 
want to get so overburdened that I thought I couldn't do justice to either 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
Consider, now, how the fates have treated Jo Anderson, a young actress cast as 
a divorced single mother, a teacher who proves sweet on Frechette's younger 
brother in "Dream Street. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who studied in New York at the Actors Studio and with Tony 
Award-winning actor Michael Moriarty, actually lived in Hoboken for five years. 
</P>
<P>
"But I went out to California two years ago because I was not getting any work 
that could pay me enough to live on," she said. "I was tiring of the 
starving-artist gig." 
</P>
<P>
When she auditioned for "Dream Street" last year, she said, the producers said 
the show would be filmed in Hoboken. "I said, 'Oh, man, I hope I get this job.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
So now, although it won't be permanent, she is living in a hamlet settled by 
the Dutch early in the 17th Century and known to them by the Indian name of 
Hobocan Hackingh, meaning "land of the tobacco pipe." 
</P>
<P>
The place is now called Hoboken.

'MISS MARY' IS BILLED AS A 'DRAMEDY,' BUT SOMETIMES ITS COMEDIC MOMENTS FALL 
UNDER THE WEIGHT OF ITS DRAMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Muriel Resnik Jackson's "Miss Mary," in its world premiere at Illusion's New 
View Theatre in Fullerton, opens deceptively on a spry, optimistic high. 
</P>
<P>
Mary's sister and two daughters flit through her Manhattan apartment, chatting 
about the upcoming trip Mary and her husband are taking to Egypt. Romantic 
cruises on the Nile, a moonlit stroll to the pyramids. 
</P>
<P>
As they conjure images, Mary arrives with a smashing red dress she just bought. 
Take a look at this, girls. See, I may be getting up in years, but I haven't 
lost it. She parades around the room, showing off, then the phone rings. Oh, 
what a nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
The swirl of good vibes ends abruptly as she learns there's been an accident. 
Her husband is in the hospital, on life support. Mary breaks down. And that's 
only the start of her troubles. 
</P>
<P>
For the next 3 months, Mary agonizes over the decision to take him off the 
respirator. Then, after he's dead, she injures herself in a fall and loses most 
of her independence. Six months later, she's paralyzed by depression. Another 6 
months and she's begging her daughter to help with her suicide. Six months 
after that, she's senile, unable even to recognize her children. 
</P>
<P>
Wow. Even though Jackson describes the play as a "dramedy," there's not much 
funny business here. "Miss Mary" is, basically, a tragedy with a few awkward 
laughs weaved in to ease the otherwise unremitting pain. Jackson, an author 
most familiar with comedy (she is best known for her 1964 Broadway success, the 
helium-filled "Any Wednesday"), attempts to meld the two, but it doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
Given the weighty subject matter, most of the humor seems forced, even out of 
place. And the few times it does click -- the wisecracks from Mary's sexually 
liberated sister Emily (Ruth Cameron), for example -- it tends to trivialize 
the play's serious intent. Director Beverly Arrowsmith is asked to keep 
everything balanced, a more than daunting job. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson should be praised, however, for trying to tackle issues that seem to 
defy easy solutions. Through Mary, we are expected to examine a happy life 
turned upside down: How can we cope with such cruel fate? 
</P>
<P>
And through her family's reactions, especially the daughters', we must consider 
what our obligations should be when a loved one becomes helpless, when the 
child becomes the parent. What are the ethical limits of our responsibilities? 
How much of ourselves should we sacrifice? 
</P>
<P>
But "Miss Mary's" biggest flaw -- even more than its uneven tone -- is that in 
trying to do so much, it leaves the philosophical landscape crowded, the 
matters unresolved. The problem is especially apparent when Resnik delves into 
the question of euthanasia. 
</P>
<P>
There is charged desperation when Elaine Barnard, as Mary, pleads with daughter 
Katherine (Carla Jones) to give her a lethal dose of sleeping pills, but the 
writing seems incomplete, inauthentic. And manipulative, not to mention 
confusing: Are we supposed to feel anger when Katherine takes Mary to the edge 
but then refuses her? Or is this last-second denial a courageous act? 
</P>
<P>
Jackson is better at getting us to understand her characters. Although Mary's 
decline seems sudden (Barnard gives her so much vitality in that first scene, 
it's hard imagining that her fall could be so quick), we do pick up on her 
dependence on her husband and on the life they shared. We also have a pretty 
good idea of Mary's pride and sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
There's yuppie self-absorption in both Katherine and the other daughter, 
Margaret (Laura Hoffman) that exemplifies a certain type of modern woman. 
Margaret has her own family and doesn't want it disturbed; Katherine is a 
professional who only has so much time to give, and it's ironic when the care 
of Mary falls to her. 
</P>
<P>
The ending is also ironic, and more than a bit chilling. The life now left to 
both Mary and Katherine is humiliating and undignified. Would it have been 
better if Katherine had given her the pills? "Miss Mary" doesn't have the 
breadth to say, but at least it asks the question. 
</P>

'OUT OF THE FRYING PAN' COOKS UP A LOAD OF LAUGHS 
</P>

<P>
There's good news for patrons of the Way Off Broadway Playhouse. For one thing, 
the small theater in Santa Ana finally has put in real seats to replace those 
makeshift jobs that were such a pain, literally. 
</P>
<P>
That's not the best news, though: After suffering through several weak, even 
embarrassing productions since it opened in late 1987, Way Off Broadway has a 
show it can be pleased about. 
</P>
<P>
As the first offering in its second season, the company has taken Francis 
Swann's seldom-staged 1930s screwball comedy "Out of the Frying Pan" and has 
plumbed its harebrained wackiness. The result is an overacted, overheated show 
that is a kick from the start. 
</P>
<P>
Director Tony Reverditto realizes that "Out of the Frying Pan" is the kind of 
play even someone with a barely responsive EEG will have no trouble 
understanding, so he immediately tosses subtlety aside. This production comes 
at you with bad accents and dopey situations, silly gags and infectious 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
Swann couldn't have put a lot of thought into the plot: What we get is six 
frisky young actors, an even mix of boys and girls, sharing a New York 
apartment that just happens to be above the flat of a big-deal Broadway 
producer. 
</P>
<P>
The kids' scheme, see, is to rehearse one of his murder mysteries in their 
apartment and then finagle him upstairs to see a performance. Amazed by their 
talents, he will sign them for his next show. 
</P>
<P>
Right. Of course, everything goes wrong. First, a blue-blooded friend (Layce 
Gardner) of the resident birdbrain (Brenda Beals) comes a calling. She finds 
the living arrangement, uh, peculiar. Then the birdbrain's stuffy politician 
father makes an entrance. Yipes, better hide the boys. Then the eccentric 
producer (Richard Flin) gets involved. Then the cops drop in. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It may not sound like much, and, guess what, it isn't. But Swann does fill most 
scenes with enough knuckleheaded gags to keep things moving. Some scenes romp 
better than others -- the busy nonsense with the police is not that funny -- 
but the show tends to work when the roommates get to interact. 
</P>
<P>
The performances can't be called original. In fact, most are straight-up swipes 
of pretty familiar characterizations -- Gardner's snob, for example, is a 
dead-eye incarnation of Miss Hathaway from "The Beverly Hillbillies" -- but 
they are amusing nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
Beals does the generic dumb blonde (sometimes she's Marilyn Monroe in 
"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes," other times she's more like Jean Kasem's Loretta of 
"Cheers") with cute results. Michael Kemp's Norman, the pumped-up, Brooklyn 
wise guy, could be any one of the Bowery Boys. Michelle Fashian as the wry Kate 
could be doing just about any Southern belle/smarty-pants, maybe a young 
Tallulah Bankhead. 
</P>
<P>
Cathleen Cullen is a natural for the role of the sweet ingenue Marge and 
Michael Gaffney has some of the most fun as the mincing, always-hungry George. 
Shawn Smyth as Marge's husband and Terri Schmidt as the landlord are also 
commendable. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, the production values are flea market utilitarian: standard blue 
blazers with upturned collars pass for police uniforms, that kind of thing. But 
that's OK, too. 
</P>

'USA TODAY ON TV' AT RATINGS CROSSROADS

<P>
The fate of the new, still-struggling "USA Today on TV" may depend on how it 
did in the February ratings sweeps that ended Wednesday, although its demise 
doesn't seem imminent. 
</P>
<P>
That was the word Wednesday from Steve Friedman, creator and the first 
executive producer of the syndicated news series that was revamped and retitled 
in mid-season after its much-criticized start last September. 
</P>
<P>
What will happen now, Friedman said, is that the stations carrying the 
half-hour program will study the Feb. 2-March 1 ratings for the show and make 
their decisions about whether to stick with it. 
</P>
<P>
Those ratings, from the nation's 200-plus TV markets, will be available in 
about two weeks, an A.C. Nielsen Co. spokeswoman here said. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman said that 150 stations -- six fewer than when it began -- now air the 
program, including KNBC-TV Channel 4 in Los Angeles, which picked it up when 
KCBS-TV Channel 2 dropped it. 
</P>
<P>
He was asked if there's a possibility of the show folding before the end of the 
two-year period that most stations, according to a spokesman for the program, 
have contracts to carry it. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always that possibility," he replied, although he emphasized that "it 
doesn't appear likely. But who knows?" 
</P>
<P>
Friedman is president of the East Coast division of GTG Entertainment, a 
production company owned by former NBC board chairman Grant Tinker and Gannett, 
Inc., the parent company of the USA Today newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The program spent $40 million gearing up. It began as "USA Today: The 
Television Show" and had four anchors. Now it has a new name, a slower pace and 
a two-anchor format. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the program has made progress," said Friedman, who last fall turned 
over the running of the show to veteran newsman James Bellows. "It's doing 
better, and if we could get a shot in New York" -- the nation's largest TV 
market -- "that would be the shot that would probably determine how we do." 
</P>
<P>
He meant a shot in the early evening hours for which the show was designed. 
WCBS-TV here had been running it at 1 a.m., then axed it. Rival WNBC-TV picked 
up it, and on Monday began airing it -- but at 5: 30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman is hoping the NBC-owned station axes the syndicated "Inside Edition" 
that it now airs at 7:30 p.m., and substitutes his company's show in that time 
slot. However, he noted, "it's their call, not ours." JAY SHARBUTT

RETAILERS 'PLEAD FOR RATIONALISM'; 
</P>
<P>
BAN ON ASSAULT GUNS CALLED TOO SWEEPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEXANDRA SMITH, Community Correspondent 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Monica City Council has unanimously passed an emergency ordinance, 
modeled on a law adopted last week in Los Angeles, that immediately bans the 
sale of semiautomatic assault rifles within the city limits and outlaws their 
possession beginning May 1. 
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen people, including the owners of the only two gun shops in 
Santa Monica, spoke against the ordinance at Tuesday night's council meeting, 
saying it is unconstitutional and won't work. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a piece of emotional legislation, confusing to the public and 
unconstitutional," said E. Bruce Jochim, who has owned a gun shop on Colorado 
Avenue for 17 years. "We're pleading for rationalism here, not emotionalism." 
</P>
<P>
Jochim, 60, a member of the National Rifle Assn., said he has never sold an 
AK-47 or Uzi in his shop, but he argued that the ordinance's definition of 
assault weapons is too broad. 
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, many of the hunting and target-shooting rifles that he 
sells could be modified after purchase to fall into the category of "assault 
rifles." Those guns are included in the ban, he said, even though they do not 
qualify as assault rifles when Jochim sells them. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman David Finkel, who originally proposed the ordinance, said there were 
compelling reasons to pass the ban. 
</P>
<P>
"If enough cities adopt this measure, then maybe there's a better chance that 
Roberti's Senate bill will pass," he said, referring to a bill now before the 
state Senate, introduced by Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), that would 
impose a statewide ban on assault weapons. A similar bill is being carried in 
the Assembly by Speaker Pro Tem Mike Roos. 
</P>
<P>
Finkel has called assault rifles the "scourge of the country." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica, like several other California cities, moved to ban the weapons 
after a drifter used an AK-47 to kill five children in a schoolyard in Stockton 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Massive Campaign 
</P>
<P>
The NRA and other pro-gun lobbyists have mounted a massive campaign to stop the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Monica, Jochim and other opponents of the new law said the city should 
concentrate on cleaning up what they call a flawed judicial system rather than 
writing more legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than banning the weapons, he said, the council should impose a 15-day 
waiting period for rifles and shotguns similar to the one already mandatory for 
the purchase of handguns. This would allow time for a background check on 
buyers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Judson Swearingen, who owns Santa Monica's other gun shop, Ames-Cole's Guns on 
20th Street, said: "What we need is criminal control, not gun control." 
</P>
<P>
Swearingen, 33, told the council that "if you want to stop criminals from 
buying rifles, we'll help you. If you want to stop the citizens from buying 
firearms, you lose our support." He also proposed a 15-day waiting period for 
buying rifles and shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
During a visit to his store earlier this week, Jochim showed several popular 
hunting guns that he said would fall under the ban. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hunted Since Childhood 
</P>
<P>
Jochim said he has hunted since he was a child. When he was 9, he said, his 
father gave him his first gun, and they would go down to the Los Angeles River 
to hunt rabbits. 
</P>
<P>
Now stuffed heads and antlers of deer he shot line the walls of Jochim's store. 
Above the cashier's counter hangs the mounted head of a javelina, a wild pig 
native to the Southwest. Below the trophy is a photograph of Jochim in the 
Arizona desert, smiling as he holds up the carcass. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got people who come in here all the time, and their love in life is to go 
to a shooting range and put five shots through the same hole in a piece of 
paper," he said. "That's what they just love to do." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the ban repeated that position several times during Tuesday's 
council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
But council members weren't buying it. 
</P>
<P>
"Why does any sportsman worth his salt need a semiautomatic weapon?" Councilman 
William H. Jennings asked. 
</P>
<P>
A man in a 10-gallon hat shouted: "You don't know 'cause you never tried it!" 
</P>
<P>
As the council voted in favor of the ordinance, several opponents noisily got 
up and left the chambers.

RESIDENTS BLOCK LIQUOR LICENSE AT NEW RALPHS 
</P>

<P>
Shoppers at the new Ralphs supermarket in the Beverly Connection shopping 
center have been looking elsewhere for beer, wine and spirits since the store 
opened last month because protests from neighbors have blocked its liquor 
license, at least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
Ralphs sold liquor for 30 years at its old store on the corner of 3rd Street 
and La Cienega Boulevard. But a handful of protests have stymied the chain's 
attempt to transfer its license to the new location two blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
100 Locations 
</P>
<P>
"This community has suffered enough with the number of liquor licenses in the 
area," said Diana Plotkin, vice president of the Beverly Wilshire Homeowners 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Plotkin, one of six residents who filed protests with the Alcoholic Beverage 
Control Board, argued that restaurants, stores and other outlets sell liquor at 
more than 100 locations within a third of a mile of the new store. 
</P>
<P>
The neighbors also said that granting the license would lead to parking 
shortages, traffic jams, loitering and juvenile delinquency. 
</P>
<P>
"We're investigating to determine if these allegations are valid and if this 
license should be issued," said Warren Tankersley, district administrator of 
the alcoholic beverage board. He could not predict when the issue would be 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ralphs has appealed to its shoppers to sign petitions urging the board 
to transfer the store's liquor license, Tankersley said the decision was up to 
an administrative law judge. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a popularity contest. It's a matter of whether the issues are 
accurate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the new Ralphs, replete with gourmet goodies to compete with the Irvine 
Ranch Market across the street, petitions at checkout stands urge the alcoholic 
beverage board to allow the sale of liquor from 6 a.m. to 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
A placard apologizes to shoppers for liquor department shelves stocked with 
encyclopedias and stuffed Easter bunnies. "We ask that you sign the petition 
and talk with your neighbors about helping us obtain a liquor license so that 
we can continue to serve you," the sign says. 
</P>
<P>
Several thousand patrons have shown their support by signing the petitions, 
said Gene Brown, senior vice president of the 136-store chain. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Previous Complaints 
</P>
<P>
He said there were no complaints about the sale of liquor at the old store, 
which closed Jan. 18, and that Ralphs does not expect any problems at the new 
location, which opened Jan. 19. 
</P>
<P>
The old site, which is across the street from the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 
was bought by the hospital in 1987. Cedars-Sinai intends to use the site for 
parking, a hospital spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The new location, twice as big as the old one, is part of a Ralphs strategy to 
open new stores in the 50,000-square-foot range while abandoning the chain's 
70,000- to 100,000-square-foot Giant emporiums. Its liquor department was 
intended to have a wide selection of wines and a full complement of beer and 
spirits, Brown said, adding that liquor departments are very important for 
supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
"You obviously don't like to have a customer make a stop someplace else, 
because that's inconvenient to the customer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Plotkin said that shoppers could just as well patronize the fully stocked 
liquor department at the drugstore at the Beverly Boulevard end of the shopping 
center. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think people in the community who live near that Ralphs will have any 
problem breaking up their shopping. If they want it bad enough, it's certainly 
available in the area," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Plotkin, a vocal critic of City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, said her group 
acted against Ralphs because the city has failed to protect the neighborhood 
against the impact of the new development, which is catty-cornered from the 
controversial Ma Maison Sofitel hotel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scaled Down 
</P>
<P>
But Yaroslavsky said prolonged negotiations resulted in a scaling-down of the 
Beverly Connection project from an original proposal of 1.1 million square feet 
of office buildings and a hotel to its final size of 296,000 square feet of 
mainly commercial uses. 
</P>
<P>
He said the parking garage next to the new Ralphs contains five parking spaces 
for every 1,000 square feet of floor space, which would be "more than adequate 
for their needs." 
</P>
<P>
Saul Panski, president of a condominium association on nearby Croft Avenue, 
said his group would withdraw its objections to the liquor license if Ralphs 
cuts back its hours of operation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not opposed per se to Ralphs selling alcoholic beverages, but we are 
opposed to them being allowed to operate 24 hours. Some of the other homeowner 
groups have more global concerns," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Brown said that although the issue of restricted hours came up in the 
negotiations, Ralphs decided to open on a 24-hour schedule once it became clear 
that Plotkin and her associates would not drop their objections. 
</P>
<P>
He said that only six outlets in the Ralphs chain are not open 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Similar protests were filed against the sale of liquor at supermarkets in West 
Hollywood and Beverly Hills in 1987, but the alcoholic beverage board 
eventually granted the liquor licenses on condition that no alcohol be sold 
after 11 p.m.

'50S DINER ORDERED TO COME BACK TO THE FUTURE, REMOVE STYLISH WINDOW DECALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Just like the 1950s-era diners it tries to emulate, the Busy Bee Cafe in 
downtown Ventura sports decals on its front window advertising, "Malts, 
Burgers, Shakes, Sodas, Chili, Sundaes." 
</P>
<P>
And like so many diners of that period did, the Busy Bee boasts, in six-inch 
block letters painted so that snow appears to have fallen atop them, that the 
cafe is "Air Conditioned." 
</P>
<P>
But in the 1950s, Ventura had no Architectural Review Board and no ordinance 
regulating commercial signs. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the city takes a dim view of ersatz "American Graffiti" decor along 
historic Main Street. Much to the chagrin of owner Ed Warren, who opened the 
popular restaurant 1 1/2 years ago, officials have ordered the signs removed as 
too large and too garish. 
</P>
<P>
"If this were on any old street in any old town, it wouldn't be that bad," said 
David Sargent, one of three architects on the city's seven-member Architectural 
Review Board. "But, as it is, it's the only building on that particular street 
with those particular graphics and it sticks out." 
</P>
<P>
Warren, who has collected about 300 signatures from customers in preparation 
for his appeal at a March 27 meeting of the board, called the order arbitrary 
and confusing. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the signs blend in nicely," he said. "They contribute to the feel and 
the ambiance of the place. . . . I don't understand exactly what they're trying 
to tell me." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the question of whether the malt signs will stay, however, the dispute 
strikes an increasingly familiar refrain in Ventura, where there are few 
aesthetic guidelines to help developers meet the constant cries to preserve 
small-town charm. 
</P>
<P>
Although such design standards are to be discussed when the City Council 
reviews Ventura's general plan later this year, officials in the meantime often 
make subjective judgments about a project's style, regardless of its other 
merits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Project Turned Down 
</P>
<P>
Just two weeks ago, for instance, the council rejected an upscale three-unit 
condominium project that, even though it met virtually all city zoning 
standards, was considered too tall and bulky to stand next to a quaint, 
European-style inn on the same downtown street. 
</P>
<P>
"It can be an arbitrary decision," said Fred Goodrich, an associate city 
planner who assists the Architectural Review Board. "It just isn't written in 
the book, what is good design." 
</P>
<P>
Warren, who owned the cafe, then called Warren's, from 1963 to 1978, thought 
that he had found a good design when he bought back his restaurant in 1987 and 
adopted the 1950s-era style that was sweeping trendy diners in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But in a routine inspection of the Busy Bee in May, a city code enforcement 
officer found that Warren did not have the needed permits for any of the signs 
on the building facade. 
</P>
<P>
Warren applied for and the Architectural Review Board approved a neon rendition 
of the cafe's namesake that hangs above the storefront. But the funky soda shop 
decals had to go, board members said. 
</P>
<P>
A city code limits the total area of signs on commercial buildings to one 
square foot for every foot of storefront, which, for the Busy Bee, translated 
into 26 square feet of signs. Of that, however, only 20% can be used for 
product advertisement, the law says. And the decals along the bottom of 
Warren's window occupy 19 square feet, or about four times as much window as 
they should have. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appeal Denied 
</P>
<P>
Warren went to the Architectural Review Board in October asking for an 
exemption, but was told that the signs were just "too much" for his storefront 
and the neighborhood, Goodrich said. 
</P>
<P>
On a drive down Main Street, one can find numerous signs more obtrusive than 
Warren's decals, including the likeness of a large Arabian genie hoisting the 
name of a carpet store above his head, a multicolored hot-air balloon atop a 
furniture store announcing a going-out-of-business sale, and even a big, ragged 
banner advertising a sale on color film printing at a camera store next door to 
the Busy Bee. 
</P>

Officials, however, explain that they do not have the manpower to enforce sign 
standards at every business in the city. Moreover, they say, some of the 
gaudiest signs were in place before Ventura adopted its sign ordinance in 1971. 
And, they add, temporary banners fall into a special category, which permits 
them to fly for 90 days a year as long as they're not up for more than 30 
consecutive days. 
</P>
<P>
"There are ugly signs all over the city," Sargent said. "As we have the time 
and personnel to deal with them, we do. . . . The Busy Bee is better looking 
than a lot of storefronts on Main Street and just not as good as some others."

W. HOLLYWOOD OFFICIAL CRITICIZES PLAN TO RECRUIT DEPUTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
City Councilman Steve Schulte this week labeled as "totally inadequate" a Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department plan to improve its image in West 
Hollywood's gay community by allowing the city to help recruit new sheriff's 
deputies. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a 3 on a scale of 10, and it's totally inadequate to address the 
problem," Schulte said of the plan, which was made public last week. 
</P>
<P>
"The inference is if you cast the net wide enough in West Hollywood, you're 
bound to catch some (gays), but if you do, the department doesn't want to know 
about it," he said. "That's not gay recruitment, and gay recruitment is what we 
need." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Private Talks 
</P>
<P>
The plan, worked out after months of private talks between representatives of 
the Sheriff's Department and city officials, calls for the city to help 
coordinate the recruitment and testing of prospective deputies in West 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Although Sheriff's Department officials deny that the plan is tacitly aimed at 
increasing the number of gays in its ranks, West Hollywood officials have made 
no secret that their interest in the arrangement hinges on the recruitment of 
gays. 
</P>
<P>
The plan represents a compromise after West Hollywood officials first asked 
that the Sheriff's Department itself openly recruit gays and lesbians in a way 
similar to that in which it recruits racial and ethnic minorities. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Sheriff Sherman Block last week gave city officials private 
assurances that harassment of any gays already in the department will not be 
tolerated should they choose to make their sexual orientation known. 
</P>
<P>
Although city officials have praised the Sheriff's Department for its 
crime-fighting abilities, gays have frequently complained to the City Council 
of being harassed by deputies. Gay rights activists have decried the fact that 
there are no acknowledged gays among the department's more than 7,000 deputies. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department provides police protection to West Hollywood -- where 
an estimated 35% of the 37,000 residents are gay -- under a contract that 
expires next year. About 120 deputies are assigned there. 
</P>
<P>
In criticizing the plan, Schulte broke ranks with other city officials, 
including City Manager Paul Brotzman and Councilman John Heilman, who have been 
more favorable in their appraisal of it. 
</P>
<P>
Brotzman called the arrangement "a real positive step in the right direction," 
and Heilman said that "while it obviously is not everything we wanted, it goes 
a long way toward satisfying our concerns." 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement marks the first time the Sheriff's Department has sought help 
in recruiting from any of the 37 cities that it patrols. 
</P>
<P>
The department has long stated that it does not discriminate against any group 
in hiring, and a Sheriff's Department official this week reiterated that the 
arrangement is not intended to target gays. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Preferential Treatment 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to target or in any other way manifest preferential treatment 
based on sexual orientation," said Sheriff's Cmdr. Bill Baker who supervises 
several sheriff's stations, including the one in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
But officials in West Hollywood, which pays the Sheriff's Department $8.5 
million a year for police services, have acknowledged that if it was not for 
complaints from the gay community about the department's hiring policies, the 
talks would have never occurred. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the arrangement, the city will place recruitment ads in gay 
publications, subject to the department's approval of the ads, and with the 
understanding that the ads will not be placed in publications that contain 
sexually explicit material, Brotzman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is going to be to get the word out throughout West Hollywood, 
including the gay and lesbian community, that the Sheriff's Department is 
looking for applicants and that it welcomes any qualified person to apply," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, the fact that the department has chosen to recruit here, and has asked 
us to cooperate with them in doing so, represents a real positive step in the 
right direction toward addressing the perception in the gay community that 
they've not been welcomed by the Sheriff's Department in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Brotzman said he has received several calls from gays who were pleased with the 
arrangement and who indicated an interest in applying for jobs as sheriff's 
deputies. 
</P>
<P>
However, a gay activist who participated in the talks with the Sheriff's 
Department joined Schulte in voicing reservations about the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel the city's efforts, laudable as they are, may be for naught unless 
there is strong support for the hiring of openly gay people as sheriff's 
deputies, and I don't see that happening as part of this arrangement," said 
Jean Conger, co-chairwoman of a city task force that last year recommended 
changes in Sheriff's Department hiring policies. 
</P>
<P>
Conger said she was "saddened and disappointed at the semantics of the 
Sheriff's Department in not addressing the hiring of gays directly, even while 
I'm hopeful that the city's effort for its part will have the effect of 
targeting the gay community." 
</P>
<P>
"The real proof of what this all means will be in what happens in the next 
several months," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Community activists were upset with the disclosure recently that of 22 formal 
complaints of ill treatment by sheriff's deputies filed with West Hollywood 
last year all but one was ruled by the Sheriff's Department to be 
unsubstantiated. City officials said that a substantial number of the 
complaints involved gays. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure followed two recent incidents that caused friction between the 
Sheriff's Department and city officials. 
</P>
<P>
Schulte complained that the arrest of a stockbroker and another man in a park 
for lewd conduct violated an "unwritten agreement," established in 1984, that 
plainclothes deputies would not be used to make such arrests. 
</P>
<P>
But Capt. Rachel Burgess, who recently was placed in charge of the West 
Hollywood sheriff's station, defended the arrests, citing citizen complaints 
about sex acts in the park. 
</P>
<P>
In the other incident, a West Hollywood hairdresser accused deputies of 
abandoning him rather than taking him to a hospital after he and a companion 
were attacked by "gay-bashers" on the street. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies said the men refused help, and Burgess said the deputies "acted 
appropriately."

SNAPSHOTS: COLLEAGUES AND FORMER STUDENTS HEAP PRAISE ON TEACHER 'WHO EXPECTED 
SO MUCH OF US' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
At testimonials, the food comes with adjectives on the side. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's luncheon honoring science teacher Al C. Rooney, who is retiring after 
31 1/2 years with Covina Valley Unified School District, saw colleagues and 
former students heaping them on: stern, fair, energetic, gifted, inspiring, 
disciplined, dedicated, hypnotic. 
</P>
<P>
Hypnotic? 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Frank Wills nodded. "He almost hypnotized you," said Wills, one of about 
100 colleagues and former students attending the luncheon in Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
Wills, now a watch commander with the Pasadena Police Department, was in 
Rooney's seventh-grade science class at Las Palmas Junior High School in Covina 
in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
"If you worked really hard," he said, "you were allowed to show up an hour 
early at school, to study." Wills' delivery was something like Tom Smothers' -- 
only the eyes belied the deadpan. 
</P>
<P>
"And then if you did well, you could stay in and study through recess, and then 
stay and study after school," Wills said. Then the deadpan cracked, and he 
grinned. "And you thought you were the luckiest guy in the world to be able to 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn Wong, 24, who organized Sunday's event, and her sister, Florence Wong, 
23, amplified on the Rooney brand of motivation. 
</P>
<P>
If Rooney's seventh-grade students memorized the periodic table of gases, they 
were allowed to study the muscles of the human body, and if they passed the 
musculature test, they were allowed to have a fetal pig to dissect, and if they 
did well, they could become part of a select group that went to Loma Linda 
University and dissected cadavers. 
</P>
<P>
A field trip to a dissecting room might seem like a big leap from the standard 
frog, which has aroused its share of squeals and shudders in countless biology 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
"They were draped," Evelyn Wong said, referring to the cadavers. "But I was 
shaking. I was scared. I went back to Mr. Rooney. 'I don't think I can do 
this.' He said, 'What's so scary?' 'They're dead bodies!' He reassured me. He 
said, 'We're all created to live, and we're all created to die, also.' He 
calmed me down. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time I got to medical school, I was used to it." 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn Wong, who is Rooney's goddaughter, says the only reason for her being a 
third-year medical student is "Mr. Rooney. He showed me how to dream big 
dreams." 
</P>
<P>
"He expected so much out of us," Florence Wong said. "It made us more 
motivated, not only in his class but in other classes." Now in her first year 
of teaching first-graders at Ramona Elementary School in Alhambra, she said, 
"I'm trying to be like him." 
</P>
<P>
At 61, Rooney seems imbued with the pugnacious energy of 10 20-year-olds, and 
as a younger man he must have created a breeze standing still. 
</P>
<P>
Decade after decade, he organized the "Crazy Eights" the "Nineties" and the 
"Tams," clubs that met in a small structure in back of his San Dimas house. The 
students sometimes stayed the night. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Rooney and his wife, Margaret ("my partner and my greatest 
inspiration" Rooney says), would take the group on a "mystery trip," a visit to 
a play, or circus, a helicopter ride or to a parade -- which the students 
marched in. 
</P>
<P>
"A teacher has to be dramatic," Rooney said the day after his testimonial. 
</P>
<P>
"I always looked at a child as a potential success. I never accepted any 
student as mediocre. I let them go to their strong suit. You meet their needs, 
and all of a sudden, they'll go to the books. . . . I was able to impart this 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
And he was a maverick, as friends Cal McClane, assistant principal at Las 
Palmas, and Ron Iannone, principal at Covina School, will readily point out. 
</P>
<P>
He was, he agrees. "The paper work? I just pushed it aside." He used to hug his 
students in the classroom, he said, as he hugged his friends at the 
testimonial. 
</P>
<P>
"I never judge people," he said. "I take that kid; we start from scratch. 'You 
and me against the world, we're gonna whip 'em.' " 
</P>
<P>
And, in the same way his students trace their success to him, Rooney says he is 
"the product of the methodology" of two important teachers in his life. 
</P>
<P>
A Pomona native, "I was on welfare, I ran the streets. I was an F student," he 
said. But when he was 12, he had a teacher who told him, "You're not dumb, you 
just don't have the skills," Rooney said. 
</P>
<P>
The idea came as a blinding light: not dumb? It was the signal of a new 
direction. And when Rooney was a student teacher, his master teacher cemented 
his confidence. "He just left me hanging. He was no help, except to say, 'Yes, 
you can do it, if you go home and figure it out.' " 
</P>
<P>
As the climax to Rooney's testimonial, there was a roast. It's hard to put the 
heat on someone when the atmosphere is awash in so much warmth. But they did 
their best. They picked on his spelling and his taste in cigarettes in his 
smoking days. 
</P>
<P>
And Frank Wills took a poke at his choice of profession. "He could have had a 
cult," he said. "Or, if Mr. Rooney'd been a TV evangelist, he would have been a 
millionaire by now."

The City Council voted 5 to 0 Monday to oppose plans by a private health 
service firm to locate a methadone maintenance and detoxification center near 
residential neighborhoods in Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
The methadone treatment center, proposed for a site at 5401 Valley Blvd. in Los 
Angeles by Altamed Health Services Corp., would be 3/10 of a mile west of 
Alhambra's city limit. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 300 heroin addicts a day may seek treatment at the center, according to a 
memorandum written by Police Chief Russ Siverling.

STUDY OF BUILDING SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Redevelopment Agency authorized an architectural planning company to 
prepare a detailed study of a site at 5168 Sepulveda Blvd., where the agency is 
considering plans for a senior citizens housing development. 
</P>
<P>
A proposed site study submitted by the firm Kurt Meyer Partners calls for a 
maximum of 50 units with 50 parking spaces at a two-story building that may be 
increased to three stories. 
</P>
<P>
The agency is seeking financing from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development and has already received applications from five nonprofit 
organizations interested in building the project at the old Liberty Tire site. 
</P>
<P>
Several homeowners who live near the proposed site expressed concerns during 
the meeting that the project might overshadow their property if allowed to 
reach three stories.

'HORRIFIED' AT SIDEWALK GUN SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After the tragic shooting of the school children in Stockton, I found myself 
seriously questioning the sanity of a society where people line up to buy the 
type of weapon used in the shooting and (where) gun dealers brag about selling 
out of these deadly weapons and having to order additional shipments. 
</P>
<P>
Now I read that a sidewalk sale of these assault weapons was held in Pasadena 
(Times, Feb. 16). As a resident of that city, I am horrified. 
</P>
<P>
So this is what our "civilized" society is coming to? Surely this kind of 
situation would not be tolerated in any other country. Can you imagine sidewalk 
sales of assault weapons in London or Paris, Rome or Tokyo? But little Pasadena 
is going to set an example for the world of what real freedom is -- the right 
to buy something for which there is no use but murder! 
</P>
<P>
I realize there are gun collectors who probably don't intend to use the guns. 
However, at the risk of sounding paranoid, I must admit I sure wouldn't like to 
live next door to someone who is heavily into collecting assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest that before we start having weekly sidewalk sales of semiautomatic 
weapons, the concerned, responsible citizens of Pasadena get the message to 
their city officials that we won't tolerate such a situation. 
</P>
<P>
By passing the buck and saying that states, not cities, should be responsible 
for banning the sale and possession of semiautomatic weapons, our city 
officials are catering to the greedy gun dealers who don't care where or to 
whom they sell their deadly goods. 
</P>
<P>
Until such time as state (and hopefully federal) legislation is enacted, let's 
pass municipal legislation banning semiautomatic weapons. Let's also notify our 
representatives and senators in Sacramento and in Washington that we've had 
enough of this barbarity disguised as freedom. 
</P>
<P>
One of our basic freedoms is the right to live without fear, and I feel that in 
a society that condones sidewalk sales of assault rifles I'm being denied that 
freedom.

COUNCILMAN HAILED FOR SIGN LAW STAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three cheers for Pomona City Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant, who has the 
courage to speak out against the Asian American Business Group, which is suing 
to overturn that city's language-related sign ordinance (Times, Feb. 16). 
</P>
<P>
It is ironic that while bitter campaigns have been waged in other parts of the 
country to have English declared our official language, the Asian business 
leaders in Pomona would have it the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
It has always been disconcerting for Americans who have grown up here to live 
alongside immigrants who continuously resist assimilation into our culture and 
refuse to speak anything but their foreign language. 
</P>
<P>
The business group's suit alleges that the sign ordinance has caused injury to 
their "personal, cultural, political and economic freedom." Perhaps the group 
should bear in mind that in no other nation of the world could they enjoy the 
freedom to establish a business enterprise as they can here. And are they 
overlooking the harm that has been inflicted on our economy by the unending 
flood of imports from their countries? 
</P>
<P>
In my view, the litigation over the Pomona sign ordinance may very well reach 
the Supreme Court, where I hope, our nine justices will shed valuable new light 
upon the First Amendment. I doubt if the Founding Fathers intended freedom of 
speech to encompass Oriental store signs.

Offer to sell a large Orange County home -- within putting distance of a 
country club -- for less than $250,000 and lots of folks would break out the 
smiles and the checkbooks, right? 
</P>
<P>
Not quite. 
</P>
<P>
Spacious homes of 2,600 to 3,000 square feet, many with Southern 
plantation-style facades and expansive lawns, line streets with names like 
Orchard and Cypress and Acacia, but buyers are not lining up. The reason seems 
inexplicable unless you happen to be standing outside one of these houses at 7 
a.m. as a 135,000-pound Boeing 737 shudders into the early morning air. 
</P>
<P>
The residents of Santa Ana Heights, an unincorporated area wedged between the 
Newport and Corona del Mar freeways, have been waking up to the roar of mammoth 
metal birds every morning since jet aircraft started flying out of nearby John 
Wayne Airport more than 20 years ago. Noise reduction devices fitted to modern 
jets have lessened the roar of individual planes, but the increase in traffic 
(now about 2,600 departures each month, most of which take off over Santa Ana 
Heights) has negated much of the effect. 
</P>
<P>
Everything from telephone conversations to television viewing is blanketed by 
the roar of engines. One 26-year resident packed away his outdoor barbecue, 
retreating to the relative quiet of his dining room for the meals and 
entertaining that he once conducted in his pleasant back yard. 
</P>
<P>
And noise has not been his only problem. Nitrous acid from jet exhaust was 
corroding the lanterns and wind chimes that swung around his patio. Now these 
adornments have joined the barbecue in storage. 
</P>
<P>
The omnipresent buzz of jet traffic over this otherwise placid neighborhood may 
have resulted in life-style changes for some residents. But many more worry 
about the effect of the noise problem on real estate values. According to one 
homeowner, houses in Santa Ana Heights sell for an average of $199,634, whereas 
homes in nearby areas, not within the flight path, sell for between $300,000 
and $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
The county has offered to retrofit the homes of interested residents with the 
latest sound-proofing gadgetry, or to buy the houses at "fair market value." So 
far, though, relatively few homeowners have taken up the offer. 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated by the obvious problems and yet ambivalent about the thought of ever 
leaving, one Santa Ana Heights resident quietly reflected: "Our friends, our 
churches -- everyone is here. This is home. . . . We've lived with the jet 
noise since 1968, and I guess we'll just have to put up with it."

DISCOVERY: TOURING IN TANDEM IN COUNTY'S OLDEST AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gil Jones is the man to see in San Juan Capistrano when you don't want to go 
very far and you're in no particular hurry to get there. 
</P>
<P>
Jones deals in slow. He reasons that the best way to drink in the atmosphere of 
Orange County's oldest neighborhood is to glide through it no faster than a 
pair of gently urged 2,300-pound horses will walk when they're in a lazy mood. 
</P>
<P>
That's just the sort of tour Jones provides each weekend and on several 
weekdays through San Juan Capistrano's Los Rios Historical District: He fills 
up a hay wagon full of people, hitches up Duke and Dan, his two Belgian draft 
horses, and plods off at a pace just slightly faster than that of a glacier. 
</P>
<P>
Jones operates his business, Carriage Services Ltd., out of a cluster of 
typical board-and-batten structures on Los Rios Street, the centuries-old San 
Juan neighborhood just across the tracks from the red-brick depot. There he and 
his wife, Millie, maintain their small house, a ramshackle office, a small 
collection of farm animals, a porcelain-painting business and a tiny pony farm. 
</P>
<P>
But the centerpiece of the operation is the hay wagon pulled by Duke and Dan, a 
matched pair that are easily the two most recognizable and possibly the most 
beloved animals in the area. Usually twice a day on weekends and often on other 
days of the week, Jones painstakingly tacks up the horses and hitches them to 
the wagon for the 35-minute or 1-hour trip around the district. 
</P>
<P>
His passengers are often children attending a birthday party but, he said, 
adults often reserve the wagon for the first half of a barbecue outing. (Jones' 
facilities include a fire pit and barbecue area with picnic tables.) 
</P>
<P>
The Jones family moved to San Juan Capistrano 9 years ago, said Jones, "and our 
idea was always to have horses." At first, said Jones' daughter, Jennifer 
Baldridge, the family had saddle horses for hire, then began offering carriage 
rides for bridal couples. Four years ago, she said, the business evolved into 
hayride tours. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd always wanted the big horses," said Jones, "ever since I lived on farms in 
Oklahoma when I was young. When I saw these two, it was love at first sight." 
</P>
<P>
Duke and Dan are 13 and 14 years old, respectively, and enjoyed a measure of 
fame before taking up residence in San Juan Capistrano. Baldridge, who narrates 
the tours from the back of the hay wagon, said the animals were used in 
episodes of the TV series "Little House on the Prairie" and "Father Murphy," as 
well as in the film "Beastmaster" and the miniseries "The Thorn Birds." They 
also pulled the Main Street horse cars at Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
Today, they devour mountains of hay and at least two large bags of carrots each 
day. But, Jones said, they do pay their freight, albeit very slowly. And the 
ride is one of the best ways for any visitor, foot-weary or otherwise, to 
become familiar with the neighborhood that was home to the original settlers 
and builders of the nearby Mission San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a real exciting pace," said Jones, giving Dan's rein a lazy flick, 
"but the kids, particularly, really love it. It's real rewarding to see their 
faces, because there are a lot of them who've never seen anything like this."

CONSULS STUCK IN MUDDLE

<TEXT>
<P>
Following established protocol for snappy speechifying, master of ceremonies 
Erich Vollmer anchored his podium duties at the "International Protocol Ball" 
on Saturday with an anecdote. 
</P>
<P>
Facing nearly 400 guests at the Four Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach -- among 
them 42 consuls general from the Los Angeles consular corps and local business 
heavyweights -- Vollmer told a story about Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who 
reportedly hated social events. 
</P>
<P>
(Vollmer, executive director of the Orange County Philharmonic Society, 
beseeched the evening's honorary chairman, James Roosevelt, not to tattle if 
this particular tale from his legendary father's life was a fable.) 
</P>
<P>
According to Vollmer, F.D.R. so hated the superficiality of high society 
occasions that he took to greeting people by saying, "I murdered my grandmother 
today." To which they simply smiled and made polite and inattentive responses. 
</P>
<P>
"Except for one time," said Vollmer, when the President used his line on "a 
lady who was actually listening. She said, 'Well I'm sure she had it coming to 
her.' " 
</P>
<P>
Fact or fiction, that was one of the few moments of levity during a pre-dinner 
ceremony that was less than the hosts had hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
Or, as event chairwoman Eva Schneider said as she stood outside the ballroom in 
the middle of the muddle: "This is terrible. I want to go home and disappear." 
</P>
<P>
The presentation was supposed to have featured a smooth flow of consuls general 
entering the packed ballroom one at a time at the side of a Marine in dress 
blues hoisting each country's flag. The host, the Protocol Foundation of Orange 
County, had hired the Murray Korda Orchestra (which regularly plays for 
Presidents and last week was in the pit at the Grammy awards show) to come up 
with some nationally relevant ditty for each consul's entrance. 
</P>
<P>
That's what should have been. As it turned out, the 30-minute ceremony was 
chaotic, with Mary Roosevelt at the podium reading a list of names that rarely 
corresponded with the consuls' erratic entrances (she doubled back three 
times); Murray Korda and his orchestra set up in the reception area outside the 
ballroom (and virtually inaudible inside); and tepid applause at best by 
confused guests as the consuls made their way to their dinner tables. 
</P>
<P>
Much livelier was the cocktail reception before dinner. 
</P>
<P>
The Protocol Foundation is a privately funded, nonprofit organization that 
promotes the county's business and cultural ties with other countries. 
Saturday's ball was the group's fifth such event, and it proved an interesting 
mix for guests. 
</P>
<P>
Over cocktails, for example, Anaheim realtor Phillip Quarre engaged Bangladesh 
Consul General Nancy Bretzfield in animated conversation amid the tux-to-gown 
crush in the reception area. The subject of their congress? 
</P>
<P>
"We're discussing the economic and social conditions in Bangladesh and 
worldwide export-import trends and Irish racing horses," Quarre said with a 
laugh. "Really. I'm not kidding." 
</P>
<P>
Swiss trade representative Anny Cabalzar discussed U.S. military plane exports 
with Fred Schneider, an international management consultant and husband of the 
event chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart Wavell-Smith and Jean Gallaway discussed Scotland, appropriately, as 
both are Scots and Wavell-Smith was wearing a kilt.

MINORITIES HOPE TO MAKE GAINS ON SCHOOL BOARD

PASADENA

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tuesday's election for three seats on the Pasadena School Board may produce for 
the first time in the city's history a board dominated by minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 80% of the students in the district are Asian, Latino or black, but 
currently, the only minority member of the board is Elbie Hickambottom, who is 
black. 
</P>
<P>
The two incumbents in the Pasadena Unified School District race, Anne W. Pursel 
and James H. McBath, are both white, but all of the challengers are minorities. 
Candidates Frank D. Rocha and George A. Padilla are Latinos, and Dennis D. 
Scott, Alicia Woods, Wilbert Smith and Arlene Moncrief are black. 
</P>
<P>
In the race for Seat 1, Padilla has the endorsement of the Unified Teachers of 
Pasadena and beat Moncrief in a poll of members of ACT, a local nonpartisan 
political action group. 
</P>
<P>
Smith has won the endorsement of the teachers union for Seat 3 and had raised 
$15,613 as of the last campaign reporting period -- more than any of his 
competitors, McBath, Scott and Woods. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign for Seat 5 has been a quiet race between Pursel and Rocha. 
</P>
<P>
Voters can cast a ballot for each of the three open seats on the five-member 
board. 
</P>
<P>
None of the candidates have raised race as an issue and each has campaigned 
solely on their experience in business or public life. 
</P>
<P>
But most candidates say the prospect of greater minority representation on the 
board is a welcome sign of change in the district. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be fantastic if the board had more minority representation," 
Padilla said. "It's the way it ought to be." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's great," Moncrief said. "You want people who are most 
representative of the entire community." 
</P>
<P>
The campaign for Seat 1 brings together two old competitors. Padilla and 
Moncrief faced each other in the 1987 election, although both lost to current 
board member Roberta Moon. 
</P>
<P>
Moncrief, an auditor for the Internal Revenue Service, has called for a return 
to basics, with more emphasis on math, language and science skills. She also is 
a strong supporter of multicultural education, saying that students should know 
more about other cultures, especially incidents such as the Holocaust, slavery 
and the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
She also supports improving benefits for teachers to remedy low morale that she 
said has become a districtwide epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
Padilla is a civil engineer who runs his own consulting firm in Pasadena and is 
vice chairman of the city's Human Relations Commission. 
</P>
<P>
He said his top priority is increasing teacher and parent participation in 
board decisions. "I call it shared decision-making," he said. "There is a 
feeling that the administration has not been as open and approachable as it 
should be." 
</P>
<P>
In the race for Seat 3, McBath, a professor of communications at USC, is 
running for his second four-year term against a field of three other 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
He said he believes the board has done an admirable job in increasing 
educational standards at all schools and increasing teacher salaries, which 
were among the lowest in the county four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
McBath said if elected to another term, he would like to see the creation of 
special middle and high schools that would emphasize specific fields, such as 
math, literature or the performing arts. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, a personnel administrator for the Veterans Administration, said his main 
concerns are improving vocational education and increasing school safety. He 
has advocated placing security guards at every school, including elementary 
schools, to stop gang and drug activity. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, a director of national accounts for Bank of America, is a reserve deputy 
sheriff in Altadena, has a master's degree in special education and was 
chairman of the steering committee for the district's kindergarten program for 
4 year olds. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he supports the creation of special schools within schools to 
enhance the teaching of math, performing arts, science and vocational skills. 
He also called for the creation of a full-time training facility to keep 
teachers abreast of new teaching and counseling methods. 
</P>
<P>
Woods is a self-described dark horse in the race and has raised no money for 
her campaign. She is the credit manager for Broadcast Equipment Rental Co. in 
Burbank and sees her run for the board as a way of spreading her message about 
controlling violence in the schools and restoring vocational education. 
</P>
<P>
Woods has proposed making parents responsible for the actions of their 
children. If their children participate in vandalism or violence, parents would 
be warned several times and then fined by the district. 
</P>
<P>
In the race for Seat 5, Pursel, a longtime community volunteer, has won the 
backing of the both the teachers' union and ACT. 
</P>
<P>
Pursel said the board has done a good job of raising teacher salaries and 
graduation requirements. She said she supports reducing class sizes, increasing 
parent involvement and opening a new middle school during the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
Her only competitor, Rocha, is making his first run for elected office and has 
raised no money. 
</P>
<P>
Rocha, a local real estate broker and frequent critic of city government, said 
he supports reducing class sizes throughout the district. He said he believes 
his experience as a local businessman would also help the district.

CALTECH CLUB SQUAD HAS 9-4-1 RECORD; 
</P>
<P>
'SMARTEST HOCKEY TEAM IN WORLD' IS A WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As a researcher and lecturer at Caltech, George Yates spends much of his day 
enlightening students about the theories and principles of mechanical 
engineering. 
</P>
<P>
At night, Yates often translates the equations of non-linear water waves and 
other concepts of fluid mechanics in another arena as coach of the successful 
Caltech ice hockey team. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of our locker room talk probably wouldn't be understood by some of the 
other teams," said Yates, 40. "I would venture to say we have the smartest 
hockey team in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Also, apparently, a talented one. 
</P>
<P>
Caltech is the defending champion of the Worden Division in the 14-team Pacific 
Collegiate Hockey Assn., which had been known for 16 years as the Southern 
California Collegiate Hockey Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The league is broken into two divisions and played at the club, rather than 
intercollegiate, level. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, USC, UC Berkeley, Stanford, Arizona State and Cal State Fullerton compose 
the Adams Division. 
</P>
<P>
Caltech, Cal Lutheran, Cal State Northridge, UC Irvine, Pepperdine and second 
teams from UCLA and USC make up the Worden Division. 
</P>
<P>
The Caltech squad is open to students, faculty members and employees of the 
university and Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
This season, the Beavers are 9-4-1 with a roster that includes four 
undergraduates, eight graduate students and 10 faculty members. In the past, 
players from France and Scandinavia have participated, but this season every 
member is either American or Canadian. 
</P>
<P>
The opportunity to continue playing or revive junior careers thought to be dead 
draws a diverse group of Caltech players to the rink. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Caltech community, people are very school-minded and they aren't very 
funny," said Martin Brouillette, 26, a graduate student from Montreal who is 
completing his Ph.D. in aeronautics and is the team's leading scorer with 16 
goals and 19 assists. "On the hockey team, we have a bunch of funny guys." 
</P>
<P>
Take, for example, Dwight Berg, a junior defenseman from College Park, Md., who 
has played hockey for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good way to get out aggression," said Berg, who is double-majoring 
in mechanical engineering and economics. "I like to get the guys at school 
excited about hockey. 
</P>
<P>
"For every penalty minute I get, they earn a bonus point toward a free 
beverage. Sometimes there's 10 or 15 guys from the dorm cheering for me to get 
penalties. It makes the game exciting. 
</P>
<P>
"It's also nice that George is the coach because I can get him to help me with 
my homework between shifts." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Fort, a 43-year-old engineer who helps run the campus astrophysics lab, 
began playing to stay in shape. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have the proper willpower to get exercise done," said Fort, who is 
Canadian. "I could never jog regularly or something like that. I need something 
that schedules me. With hockey, everything is laid out in advance. You know 
exactly when you play and practice." 
</P>
<P>
Caltech players pay $200 for the privilege of lacing up their skates, donning 
the Beavers' sweater and practicing twice a week -- after 10 p.m. on weekdays 
and Sunday mornings at 11:15 -- at the Pasadena Ice Skating Center behind the 
Pasadena Civic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the varying skill level of players and Yates' willingness to give 
everyone playing time during games, Caltech has managed to win five division 
championships over the years. 
</P>
<P>
"They are disciplined," said Cal Lutheran Coach Wayne Frye. "They don't make a 
lot of mistakes. Obviously, they have a pretty solid academic background. Maybe 
that's why they're so good on the ice. They take an engineer's approach." 
</P>
<P>
Said Pepperdine Coach Sean McGillivray: "Caltech plays a dump-and-chase, 
hard-hitting game, which is probably closer to what you see in the pros. That 
game is very difficult to defend against. The smaller the arena, the more 
advantageous it is for a team that does not have a lot of fast skaters." 
</P>
<P>
An abundance of crude rinks that vary in size and are often rimmed by a chain 
fence rather than plexiglass has not deterred the league's growth in 
popularity. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran, which began as nothing more than a marketing project for Frye's 
business students, has become the league's showpiece and the model for other 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Before Wayne Gretzky skated onto the ice at the Great Western Forum for the Los 
Angeles Kings, Cal Lutheran was packing more than 500 fans into the Conejo Ice 
Skating Center, which is located in an abandoned discount store in Newbury Park 
and has a seating capacity of just 200. 
</P>
<P>
That kind of support is difficult to imagine at Caltech. The largest crowd in 
Caltech history was about 300 for a game two years ago against Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
"Our priorities are a little different from maybe USC, Pepperdine or some of 
our other neighbors," said Ted Herowitz, vice president for institute 
relations. "It's a hard thing to ask the priority of a hockey team versus a new 
laboratory for a biologist or a chemist." 
</P>
<P>
With an attack led by Brouillette, Pavel Svitek (14 goals, 19 assists) and Mike 
Freeman (15 goals and 11 assists), Caltech figures to once again challenge for 
the division title, which will be decided at the league tournament April 4-9 at 
the Conejo Ice Skating Center and the Pickwick Ice Arena in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Caltech travels to Culver City Ice Rink to play UCLA in one of three 
remaining regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been a couple of exceptions, but there's kind of a tradition of 
Caltech athletic teams being losers," Yates said. "We've traditionally had a 
winning season, and I think we have a good chance to defend our title this 
year."

BRONCO WOMEN FAVORED IN BASKETBALL TOURNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal Poly Pomona's women's basketball team has yet to lose a game in the three 
years that the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. Tournament has been played, 
and the Broncos are the top seed again when competition starts tonight at Poly 
Pavilion in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos, 22-5 overall record and ranked No. 2 nationally in NCAA Division 
II, will face fourth-seeded Cal State Los Angeles (17-11) in their first-round 
game at 8 after second-seeded and 17th-ranked Cal State Northridge (20-7) meets 
Chapman (13-12) at 6. 
</P>
<P>
First-round winners will meet for the championship at 6 p.m. Saturday at 
Riverside Community College. 
</P>
<P>
It is the second time in less than a week that Pomona has faced Cal State L.A.. 
The Broncos rolled to a 90-59 victory over the Golden Eagles in the 
regular-season finale last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The one-sided win couldn't have come at a better time for Pomona, which had 
suffered its first -- and only -- conference loss to Northridge (67-61) earlier 
in the week. Pomona finished 11-1 in the CCAA. 
</P>
<P>
"(That) game was a good springboard for us going into the playoffs," Coach 
Darlene May said. "It's always better going in with a win than a loss and if we 
continue to play like that, we have a good shot the rest of the way." 
</P>
<P>
Pomona has been led by its All-American tandem of junior center Niki Bracken 
(6-2), who averages a team-high 18.5 points and 8.8 rebounds, and senior guard 
Cathy Gooden (5-5), who is averaging 15.9 points and a team-high 5.4 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Another standout in the game against Cal State L.A. was senior forward Susan 
Luckinbill (5-9), who grabbed a career-high 20 rebounds and is averaging 9.2 
points and 5.5 rebounds for the season. The Broncos also start sophomores 
Stephanie Coons (5-10) at forward and Carrie Egan (5-8) at guard. 
</P>
<P>
In Cal State L.A., the Broncos will face a team that has an outstanding front 
line including center Lupe Quintana. The 6-0 senior, the leading rebounder in 
CCAA history, averaging 11.3 rebounds and 14.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Eagles, who finished at 7-5 in the CCAA, including two losses to 
Pomona, have other standouts in 6-0 junior forwards Tina Slatinsky and Trisha 
Maly. Slatinsky averages 12.8 points and 6.6 rebounds and Maly 10.4 points. 
</P>
<P>
After playing impressively in non-conference games, the Cal Poly Pomona women's 
softball team opens its Big West Conference season with doubleheaders against 
the University of Hawaii at 1:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos, who had a 57-16 record and finished third in the NCAA Division I 
World Series last year, lost many of their top players to graduation but have 
won 10 of 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona returns outstanding pitchers Nicky Luce and Lori Thompson and All-Big 
West Conference catcher Denise Correa. Luce batted .304 with 4 home runs and 26 
runs batted in last season, Luce was 25-8 with 13 shutouts and an 0.67 
earned-run average, and Thompson was 9-3 with an 0.81 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos have also flourished behind the play of two freshman infielders, 
shortstop Shellie McCall and second baseman Kathy Twisselman. McCall, an 
All-CIF player at Corona High last season, is the team's leading hitter at 
.333. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona's infield has also benefited from the addition of third baseman Heather 
DeLuca, who started in right field last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos are fresh from a 7-0 finish in round-robin play at the Arizona 
State Tournament last week. The unranked Broncos defeated four teams rated in 
the Division I top 20: No. 10 Iowa State, No. 11 Minnesota, No. 16 Arizona 
State and No. 17 Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
They will face a Hawaii team that was 30-29 last season but has struggled to a 
2-7 record in nonconference play. The Rainbow Wahines are led by pitcher Cindy 
Schneller, who also is the team's top hitter at .357. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Poly Pomona and UC Riverside, baseball teams that were expected to be among 
the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. favorites this season but are having 
slow starts, will meet in conference games Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
They will play at 2:30 p.m. Friday at Pomona and 1 p.m. Saturday at Riverside. 
Pomona also hosts Keio University of Japan in an game at 2:30 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona entered the week at 1-2 in the CCAA and 2-11 overall while Riverside was 
0-3 in the conference and 4-10 overall. But both are ranked in the NCAA 
Division II top 20 by Baseball America magazine, largely because the losses 
have come mostly against Division I opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside, which finished second in the CCAA last season, is ranked 18th and 
Pomona, which won the conference a year ago, is No. 19.

'DEDICATED EFFORT' ENDS WITH NAMING OF CYNDI GALLAGHER; 
</P>
<P>
UCLA GOES AGAINST TIDE WITH NEW SWIMMING COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN FLEISCHMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Judith Holland makes no qualms about it. 
</P>
<P>
When the position as women's swimming coach at UCLA opened up this year, 
Holland, the women's athletic director, decided that she was going to hire a 
woman for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was completely dedicated to finding a woman for the job," Holland said. "I 
think enough jobs go to men that there has to be a dedicated effort to seek out 
and find women." 
</P>
<P>
And with that attitude, and the hiring of Cyndi Gallagher as women's swimming 
coach, Holland is intentionally going against the tide. 
</P>
<P>
Just 25.3% of women's swimming coaches at four-year universities in 1988 were 
women, down from 53.6% in 1972, according to an 11-year study of women's 
athletics by Linda Carpenter and Vivian Acosta, professors of physical 
education at Brooklyn College. Over that same period, there has been an overall 
decrease in the percentage of women coaches. Just 48.3% of coaches of women's 
teams in 1988 were females, compared to 58.2% in 1978 and 78.9% in 1972, 
according to the same study. The percentage of women coaches at the Division I 
level is approximately 5% lower, Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest obstacles to overcome, Holland said, is the lack of a large 
pool of women coaches to choose from. When Holland decided not to renew the 
contract of Tom Jahn after last season, about 25 coaches applied for the 
opening. 
</P>
<P>
Holland interviewed only three candidates, however, because Gallagher was the 
lone female applicant. Ironically, Jahn's wife Barbara is the head coach at UC 
Davis and would have been one of the few other females qualified for the UCLA 
job. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter disagrees with Holland about the small number of candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a lack of qualified women. It's the result of years of having few 
female role models and years of having to do with prejudice, although most of 
it I don't feel has been intentional," Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
Jill Sterkel, an assistant at Texas who applied for the USC position, which was 
also open this year, was surprised that UCLA hired Gallagher because of her 
lack of head coaching experience. Sterkel, however, does not think that it is 
necessary to make an extra effort to hire women coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I could go out and get a head coaching job somewhere, just not at a 
major Division I school right off the bat," Sterkel said. "The person they 
hired here (Mark Shubert) was a million times more qualified than I was." 
</P>
<P>
The hiring of Gallagher was a particularly bold step by Holland because the 
former UCLA All-American and assistant to Jahn did not have Division I 
experience as a head coach -- unlike many of the other applicants -- and had 
spent the previous year as a travel agent. 
</P>
<P>
"But neither did Tom Jahn," said Holland, about Gallagher's lack of experience 
as a head coach. "People raise that question about Cyndi, but they didn't about 
Tom. I don't see the difference. . . . Cyndi had every possible qualification 
except one, that she hadn't been a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
"That bias is everywhere, with the media, with my fellow athletic directors. 
I'm planning to use our visibility here to change that." 
</P>
<P>
Holland points out that during the same period that the UCLA position was open, 
three other high-profile universities -- USC, Stanford and Texas -- had 
openings for women's swimming coaches and those jobs went to men. 
</P>
<P>
"All I did was cut the odds a little bit in favor of women," Holland said. "And 
I tell you, if I didn't set my mind to hiring a woman, we'd have a man here 
too." 
</P>
<P>
One program Holland has instituted at UCLA to help increase the pool of women 
qualified for head coaching and administrative positions is to have at least 
one female assistant coach for every team. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to cut my biases against men. That's not fair either," Holland 
said. "But a man can get a job in both men's and women's departments. Women 
can't. They're limited to women's athletics. If that's cut off too, she's in a 
real tough spot." 
</P>
<P>
The only opposition Holland received to hiring Gallagher came from the team's 
members. During a meeting with them, Holland heard various members voice 
concerns about whether a woman would be strict enough, a complaint the team had 
against Jahn. According to Holland, one swimmer -- whom Holland refused to 
identify -- transferred because of the hiring of Gallagher. 
</P>
<P>
Another concern Holland received from team members was that Gallagher would 
bring her 3-year-old daughter Tori to workouts, taking time away from the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't figure out why it was O.K. for Tom to bring his daughter to 
practice but not all right for Cyndi. I've learned over the years not to let my 
anger show, but I was getting pretty upset," Holland said. "In their defense, 
they have only had men coaches all through their careers. 
</P>
<P>
"So I put the question to them of how many of them wanted to coach eventually. 
Several said that they did. So I asked them, 'Well, who are you going to 
coach?' " 
</P>
<P>
Said Jenny Susser, a senior from Irvine: "I guess it was because there aren't 
that many women coaches at the national level. It was just something totally 
different to us." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever went into the hiring of Gallagher, however, this season she has 
surpassed the expectations of nearly everyone, including Holland. The Bruins 
went through their regular season schedule with a 9-1 record, losing only to 
second-ranked Stanford, and placed third at the Pacific 10 Conference meet this 
last weekend, behind Stanford and Cal. The Bruins have had five swimmers, three 
relay teams and two divers qualify for the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
championships, to be held March 16-18 in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
In Jahn's six-year term as head coach, the Bruins finished between sixth and 
25th nationally and finished second in the Pac-10 twice, in 1984-85 and 
1985-86. 
</P>
<P>
Gallagher came to UCLA in 1980 after swimming her freshman year at the 
University of Houston and then attending Washington for one year, where she did 
not swim. Swimming at UCLA for three years, Gallagher -- then Cyndi McCullam -- 
set school records in the 1,000 and 1,650 freestyle, both of which have 
recently been broken by current swimmers Missy Herndon (1,000) and Sheri Smith 
(1,650). 
</P>
<P>
After graduating with a degree in political science, Gallagher spent five years 
(1982-87) as an assistant to Jahn. 
</P>
<P>
Gallagher finished 10th in the 800 freestyle at the Olympic trials in 1976 and 
spent the next four years training to make the 1980 team. 
</P>
<P>
Gallagher remembers where she was when she heard that then President Carter 
decided to boycott the Moscow games in response to the Soviet invasion of 
Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
"It's weird that the Soviets are just now pulling out of Afghanistan," she 
said. "I was really heartbroken. I shouldn't have taken it as hard as I did. . 
. . I guess it will make me hungrier as a coach to get a swimmer of mine on the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if Amy (Carter's daughter) had been into athletics, he'd have thought 
twice about doing it. But I'm just a political science major at UCLA, so who am 
I to say what's wrong or right?" 
</P>
<P>
For Gallagher, the only negative reaction she has gotten has come from other 
coaches. After she was hired in April, she was on the phone with a recruit when 
another coach called the recruit on another line and told her that "the woman 
UCLA hired doesn't know what she's doing." 
</P>
<P>
Parents of recruits showed surprise when she introduced herself. The father of 
one asked Gallagher how old she was and whether she was married. 
</P>
<P>
"Like that has any bearing on anything," remarked Gallagher, who has been 
married for seven years and lives in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the team's concerns about Gallagher's ability to discipline, no problem 
has arisen this season, according to Holland and Gallagher. The problem was a 
factor in not renewing Jahn's contract, Holland said. Jahn refused to comment 
on why he left UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Concerns about her family situation have also proved to be naught. Gallagher 
has missed a handful of practices when her daughter was ill and has brought her 
to practice just once, when a baby-sitter canceled. 
</P>
<P>
"At the first meeting, I explained to them why I got the job. That it wasn't a 
gift," Gallagher said. "They didn't hand me the job and say go ahead and have 
fun. Obviously, they believe I can handle the job. UCLA isn't the kind of 
university that would give the job to just anybody."

Nobody picked all six winning numbers in Wednesday night's Lotto 6-49 game, and 
Saturday's jackpot will grow to an estimated $40 million, California Lottery 
officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
Five winning numbers plus the bonus paid $569,339 each to five players, while 
five numbers without the bonus were worth $3,849 to each of 381 players. The 
$26.7-million jackpot for Wednesday's drawing will roll over to Saturday, 
growing with ticket sales to an estimated $40 million to become one of the 
largest jackpots in California Lottery history.

Federal immigration agents arrested 31 illegal aliens at Los Angeles 
International Airport overnight, bringing to more than 200 the number of people 
nabbed in a nationwide crackdown on high-altitude "people smuggling," 
authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
The mass arrest was the fourth this week. 
</P>
<P>
"We got 31 more heading out to various cities across the country, but we're not 
stopping there," said Ernest Gustafson, director of the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service's Los Angeles District. "They (illegal aliens) can 
expect our agents out there at airports today, tonight and for the foreseeable 
future. 
</P>
<P>
"This is part of our program to monitor all flights at LAX. I understand now 
that because of that they are building up at Las Vegas and Phoenix (airports)."

The identities of the woman killed and the two men injured in the 8 a.m. 
accident on Topanga Canyon Boulevard at Erwin Street were not released. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Joe Cross said a car with a man and woman in it was heading southbound on 
Topanga Canyon Boulevard and attempted to turn left on to Erwin Street. The 
driver of the northbound Jeep was unable to stop and the two vehicles collided. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, who was a passenger in the car, died at the scene of the accident. 
The driver was hospitalized with unknown injuries while the driver of the Jeep

A 21-year-old army electronic warfare signal specialist from California who had 
access to classified documents is missing and may have defected to East 
Germany, an Army spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Spec. Michael A. Peri of Laguna Niguel, Calif., was reported 
missing from his base in West Germany on Feb. 21. Two days later his jeep was 
found about a mile from the East German border, near the town of Oberstuhl. 
</P>
<P>
His personal belongings had been left behind. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not rule out the possibility that he has crossed to East Germany," said 
Capt. Robert Jones, a spokesman for the 5th U.S. Army Corps in Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
(In Laguna Niguel, Peri's mother said she fears for her son's safety. 
</P>
<P>
("My son is missing," said a distraught Winnie Peri, who spoke briefly at the 
family's sprawling hilltop home in an exclusive subdivision. "That's all we 
know. We're just praying to God that Michael's safe." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Have a Missing Son' 
</P>
<P>
(Retreating inside, she pleaded through an intercom: "Please, please be 
sympathetic. We have a missing son.") 
</P>
<P>
Jones said Peri -- twice nominated for "Soldier of the Month" -- was based in 
the central German town of Fulda with the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, which 
is responsible for patrolling a section of the border that divides East and 
West Germany. The Pentagon said Peri has been assigned to the unit since March 
4, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Peri is an electronic warfare signal intelligence specialist, whose duties 
were to intercept non-communications signals, such as radar signals," Jones 
said. "He had access to classified information at a certain level; he knew what 
he needed to know to perform his duties." 
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon spokesman declined to discuss the type of classified information to 
which Peri had access other than to say that "as a matter of policy, soldiers, 
regardless of rank, have access only to that classified information required 
for the performance of their duties." 
</P>
<P>
Jones said investigations are under way to find out exactly what information 
Peri had access to and what significance it might have for communist East 
Germany. The Pentagon said assistance was requested from West German 
authorities in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Jones said Army investigators in Germany found that a laptop computer was 
missing and suspect that Peri may have taken it. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon spokesman in Washington said: "As far as we know at this time, all 
the accountable documents are present. But whether or not he took any 
classified information with him, that's part of the investigation." 
</P>
<P>
"We have no indication of his whereabouts," the spokesman added. 
</P>
<P>
On the day he was reported missing, Peri had signed out a jeep belonging to his 
section. 
</P>
<P>
"He had the right to use the jeep but had no duties along the border. His job 
did not entail patrolling," Jones said, adding that Peri was considered a 
"stable and hard worker."

LAGUNA NIGUEL GI MISSING; ARMY FEARS HE'S DEFECTED;

A 21-year-old army intelligence specialist from Laguna Niguel is missing from a 
U.S. military base in West Germany, and Army officials said today they are 
concerned that he may have defected to East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The mother of Army Spec. 4 Michael A. Peri spoke briefly to reporters at the 
family's sprawling hilltop home in an exclusive subdivision in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"My son is missing," said a distraught Winnie Peri. "That's all we know. We're 
just praying to God that Michael's safe." 
</P>
<P>
Retreating inside, she pleaded through an intercom, "Please, please be 
sympathetic. We have a missing son." 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Fred R. Peri, arrived home early this afternoon from his job as 
contract administrator at Fluor Daniels Corp. in Irvine. "All I know is my son 
is missing," he said tersely. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Peri, who was trained to analyze electronic warfare signals such as 
radar, was reported missing from the 11th Calvary headquarters in Fulda, West 
Germany, on Feb. 21, according to Maj. Kathy Wood, a Pentagon spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
A military vehicle that he had checked out was found two days later about 30 
miles northeast of Fulda near the village of Obersuhl, just a mile from East 
Germany, Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
A laptop computer is also missing and believed taken by Peri, who would have 
had access at a minimum to information with a security classification of 
"secret," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exemplary Military Record 
</P>
<P>
The soldier had an exemplary military record and was nominated twice for best 
soldier in his unit, Wood said. An investigation is under way to determine what 
information he may have worked with and the significance of the material for 
East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Army has requested assistance from West German authorities in 
the search for Michael Peri. While she acknowledged concern that he may have 
defected, Wood said there is still no proof. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no evidence at this point that proves he is anything but missing," 
Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Jake Dye, an Army spokesman in Fulda, was quoted in today's Stars and 
Stripes, the armed forces newspaper, as saying, "We still can't confirm that 
he's defected, but the circumstances of that vehicle being found so close to 
the border are definitely suspicious." 
</P>
<P>
Dye described Peri as "a normal kid." 
</P>
<P>
"No deep romantic involvement with anybody that we know of. Friends are just as 
surprised as his parents and the unit commander," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Peri grew up in La Habra, where his family lived on Exeter Drive from 1980 to 
last September when they moved to a $400,000 home in the Bear Brand Ranch 
subdivision in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
He studied to be an intelligence officer in an 18-week course at Ft. Devens, 
Mass., base spokesman Phil Morris confirmed today. Intelligence candidates, who 
are selected on the basis of entrance test scores and personal and criminal 
background checks, receive a security clearance of "secret."

Municipal Court Judge David Horwitz today granted bail in the amount of $2 
million for actor Todd Bridges, charged with the attempted murder of a man 
inside a reputed rock house. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges, 23, the former child star of NBC-TV's "Diff'rent Strokes," had been 
held in custody without bail since his arrest a month ago. Over the objections 
of prosecutors, Judge Horwitz set bail at $2 million for the actor. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges, however, will remain in custody without bail in a separate case in 
Compton in which he is charged with stealing his BMW automobile at gunpoint 
from a South Los Angeles repair man without paying a $500 bill.

South Korea's First Lady today sent money to a grief-stricken family whose four 
girls took rat poison so their parents would have enough money to send their 
brother to school. 
</P>
<P>
The girls, aged 6 to 13, were found unconscious Monday. The youngest girl died 
immediately. Police said the others were in critical condition today. 
</P>
<P>
Korean newspapers gave the story prominent display, and editorials on the 
children's plight criticized public policies that some said do too little for 
the young and the poor. Editorials also blamed a male-dominated social 
structure that often leads to discrimination against girls and women. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the eldest of the four girls, Yang Soon Mi, told authorities the 
children made a suicide pact to ease their parents' financial burden and leave 
enough money for the education of their 3-year-old brother. 
</P>
<P>
Money for schooling has traditionally been provided first to boys. 
</P>
<P>
The father, Yang Tae Bun, 44, is a factory worker who supports the family on 
the equivalent of $362 a month, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The story led to an outpouring of sympathy led by First Lady Kim Ok Sook, wife 
of President Roh Tae Woo. She sent the family condolences and an undisclosed 
amount of money, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Seoul newspapers quoted the girls' teachers as saying they studied hard and 
were quiet, model students. 
</P>
<P>
A neighborhood shopkeeper said Soon Mi told him she could not afford $5.80 
worth of notebooks and pencils for school and asked to pay later.

European Community environment ministers agreed today on a surprise pact that 
would virtually eliminate household gases used in refrigerators and spray cans 
that are destroying the Earth's protective ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
An EC spokesman said the ministers had agreed to eliminate chlorofluorocarbon 
production and consumption by the year 2000, and to an 85% cut as soon as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a quantum leap forward," Britain's Lord Caithness told reporters. The 
ministers had originally expected to agree only on an 85% cut by the end of the 
century. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 countries agreed in a treaty signed in Montreal in 1987 to halve CFC 
production by 1998. Diplomats said the 12-nation community wants to take the 
lead in pushing the world toward total cuts.

Illegal immigrants are being housed in tents after the dormitories at a 
southern Texas detention center filled up with rejected applicants for 
political asylum, an immigration official said today. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-eight men slept in a tent Tuesday night, after the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service ran out of bed space for male detainees in buildings at 
the minimum-security center here, INS spokeswoman Virginia Kice said. "This is 
the first time the tents have been deployed," Kice said. "We've reached our 
capacity." The INS has been faced with a flood of Central Americans it 
maintains are filing "frivolous" applications for political asylum after 
illegally crossing the Rio Grande into southern Texas.

NORTH RAN CONTRA TALKS, WITNESS SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
LIAISON MAN TELLS ABOUT 1985 MEETING TO PLAN REBEL FRONT

<P>
A Miami man today described how Oliver North ran a 1985 meeting that focused on 
the Contra rebels opening a southern front in their war against the leftist 
government of Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Rafael Quintero, a Cuban-American who helped coordinate the Contra arms supply 
effort, testified at the trial of the former White House aide that "basically 
Mr. North" was in charge of the June 28, 1985, meeting at Miami International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Also attending the meeting, he said, were Contra leaders Adolfo Calero and 
Enrique Bermudez as well as retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord and 
his associate Thomas G. Clines, an ex-CIA official, who were involved in 
obtaining arms and shipping them to the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, it was North's suggestion "to open a southern front," Quintero 
told a jury in U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plan to Cut Supply Line 
</P>
<P>
He added that North also discussed the possibility of sinking a barge to 
obstruct the Rama River in order to cut off a military supply line that 
Nicaragua's Sandinista government was using. Eighty percent of the supplies 
passed across the river, Quintero said. 
</P>
<P>
Quintero also testified he once heard North say that President Reagan backed 
the clandestine effort to resupply the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
This was, Quintero said, at a 1986 meeting in El Salvador when a high 
Salvadoran official tried to get a commitment for continued aid. "This high 
official was not going to stick his neck out and have it cut off," Quintero 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. North pointed out the President was very much aware of the efforts this 
high Salvadoran official was doing, that the President wanted these efforts to 
continue" he added in broken English. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Little Man From South' 
</P>
<P>
Further, Quintero testified, North told the Salvadoran that when aid resumed 
legally -- as it did in October, 1986 -- that the Salvadoran's position would 
become "much easier than now." 
</P>
<P>
Quintero said that in 1985 he returned from an inspection tour of Contra 
operations in Central America. While in the Vienna, Va., offices of Secord, the 
retired general telephoned North, telling him that "the little man from the 
south just came back" with a report, Quintero testified. 
</P>
<P>
Quintero, a veteran of the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba who did work for 
the CIA, said that Secord had enlisted his help in assisting the Contras and 
that he was paid about $228,000 over two years for his efforts, including 
expenses.

STORIES OF TIPSY PRESIDENTS, SOBER DEFENSE CHIEFS TOLD

U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston said today that there have been two instances in the 
past in which defense secretaries decided not to carry out a presidential order 
because they "felt that the President had had a bit too much to drink." 
</P>
<P>
The California Democrat did not identify the occasions, except to say they had 
occurred under different secretaries and different Presidents. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Democratic whip made his comments at a breakfast meeting with 
reporters in which he discussed John Tower's troubled nomination to become 
defense secretary. A spokesman later said Cranston will oppose the nomination, 
which is in jeopardy of being rejected by the Democratic-controlled Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston mentioned the two incidents to reporters, saying they were indications 
that the nation cannot afford to have a secretary of defense who might be under 
the influence of alcohol and "unable to make a thoughtful and wise, quick 
decision on a matter of life and death for our country." 
</P>
<P>
Tower has been buffeted by questions about his drinking habits. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston's office issued a partial transcript of the breakfast session, and the 
senator said his information on the two incidents came from "what I consider an 
unimpeachable source that's familiar as anyone is with military matters." 
</P>
<P>
He said there have been two instances since the position of defense secretary 
was created in which the Pentagon chief decided not to carry out presidential 
orders because he "felt that the President had had a bit too much to drink at 
that time and decided to wait until the President was sober before seeing if 
that was still what the President wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
Cranston said neither of the incidents he was referring to involved a widely 
rumored incident in 1974 when Defense Secretary James Schlesinger issued an 
order to the armed forces not to execute any orders he had not personally 
approved. Richard Nixon was President at the time and in the throes of an 
impeachment crisis spawned by Watergate.

SOVIETS UNCORK CAMPAIGN TO SELL NEW SUPERVODKA

Under Lenin's dour gaze from a giant portrait, Soviet officials uncorked their 
new export supervodka and hustled American guests like born-again capitalists, 
with grins, backslaps and heaping bowls of caviar. 
</P>
<P>
Glasnost was in full flower Wednesday night at the Soviet Embassy, and warm 
feelings of "openness" were stoked by frequent gulps of Stolichnaya Cristall, 
the ultra-premium Russian vodka that will appear on liquor store shelves in 10 
American cities, including Los Angeles, this week. 
</P>
<P>
"You might ask, what is the difference between Stolichnaya and Stolichnaya 
Cristall," Soviet Ambassador Yuri V. Dubinin smilingly told the happy throng. 
"I suspect the effect is just the same, but Stolichnaya Cristall is better for 
your health." 
</P>
<P>
If Dubinin and his marketing comrades get their way, Stolichnaya Cristall will 
be good for the health of the Soviet economy, which suffers from a shortage of 
hard Western currencies. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department says the United States imported a record $1.7 billion 
in Soviet goods last year, compared with U.S. exports of nearly $2.8 billion to 
the Soviet Union. The U.S. export figure, representing largely grain, was up 
87% from the previous year but below the record $3.6 billion in 1979 before the 
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan prompted a U.S. embargo. 
</P>
<P>
Stolichnaya Cristall, like the older Stolichnaya brand, is bought by PepsiCo 
Inc. for resale in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Stolichnaya Cristall is named for the Cristall distillery in Moscow, one of the 
two plants that produce the prestige export vodka. The latest version, 
developed in 1982, is made from the finest winter wheat and the purest spring 
waters from the Moscow region. 
</P>
<P>
Drawn from the finest 5% of the alcohol that trickles through three sets of 
activated charcoal filters, Stolichnaya Cristall is "like taking the cream off 
the top of the milk," a PepsiCo official said. 
</P>
<P>
Retail U.S. prices will be ultra-premium as well. A bottle of Stolichnaya 
Cristall will sell for $18 to $20 retail.

Shares of Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp., the largest vendor of corporate credit

</P>
<P>
Dun &amp; Bradstreet stock was down $1.875 at $50.50 at midday as the most 
actively traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange, running counter to a 
rally in the broader market. An article in the Wall Street Journal discussed 
charges that the company had misled its customers into overbuying its services. 
The report said that some customers had sued the company and that the total 
amount of disputed and potentially disputed charges could be in the millions of 
dollars.

The Defense Department released its fiscal 1988 total of prime contract awards 
to companies, which showed McDonnell Douglas received $8 billion in work last 
year to remain at the top of the list. The fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The St. Louis-based defense giant builds F-15 and F-18 fighter jets, Tomahawk

NEW FORECASTING GAUGE TO DEBUT; ANALYSTS SKEPTICAL

The government on Friday will issue a new version of its much-maligned chief 
economic forecasting gauge, but skeptical private analysts expect little 
improvement in the monthly report's track record. 
</P>
<P>
The index of leading economic indicators -- sometimes derided by its critics as 
the index of misleading indicators -- is designed to foretell future economic 
activity by evaluating forward-pointing business statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Government policy makers and private investors watch the index closely for 
indications of strength or weakness in the U.S. economy as much as six months 
in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Using data information to 1948, the composite index has correctly predicted all 
eight recessions by dropping for at least three months in a row, but it also 
forecast four recessions that never materialized. 
</P>
<P>
January's report, to be issued Friday, will drop two of 11 components from the 
index, revise two others and feature two new indicators of economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Moran, a spokesman for the government's Bureau of Economic Analysis, said 
today that the changes will make the index less prone to after-the-fact 
revision, less apt to make false predictions of future downturns and more 
precise at predicting when downturns will occur. 
</P>
<P>
"This index is so good that it has predicted 12 of the last eight recessions," 
he quipped. "The new index will be less inclined to give us false signals. We 
hope it will be better at telling us when they (downturns) are going to occur."

Opening competition in the 1989 NCAA Ski Championships was delayed today by a 
"typical March snowstorm" that dumped more than 1 foot of snow on the courses. 
While the women's giant slalom competition was scheduled to get off at 10 a.m., 
it first was pushed back until 11 a.m. and then until noon because of the 
strong storm. Men's competition, originally set for 11 a.m., was pushed back an 
hour and then postponed until 11 a.m. Friday. The changes were made because of 
continued heavy snow from the Pacific storm system and fog that drastically cut 
visibility at the Jackson Hole Ski Resort.

BLUE CHIP MIAMI RECRUIT WANTS OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Blue chip Miami recruit Darren Krein doesn't want to attend Miami now that head 
coach Jimmy Johnson has left the university for the Dallas Cowboys, and the 
Aurora, Colo., senior has hired a lawyer to challenge the legality of his 
national letter of intent. 
</P>
<P>
The move, announced Wednesday by Krein's attorney, makes Krein the first of the 
school's stable of 25 recruits to say he doesn't want to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Miami quarterback Bryan Fortay of East Brunswick, N.J., has said he plans to 
transfer if Miami offensive coordinator Gary Stevens isn't promoted to 
Johnson's old post. 
</P>
<P>
In response, Miami associate athletic director Doug Johnson made it clear the 
school feels no obligation to let anyone go.

COUGAR QUARTERBACK ROSENBACH CONSIDERS GOING PRO, FRIEND SAYS

A friend of Washington State's Timm Rosenbach says the star quarterback is 
considering making himself eligible for the National Football League 
supplemental draft in May, a newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Cougar tight end Doug Wellsandt, a close friend of the 6-foot-2, 210-pound 
quarterback, told the Spokesman-Review of Spokane that Rosenbach's decision 
hinges on whether coach Dennis Erickson accepts the University of Miami, Fla., 
head coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, we've talked about it," Wellsandt said. "We don't know if we're coming 
back." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbach, a junior who led the nation in pass efficiency last season and is 
considered a candidate for the Heisman Trophy, led the Cougars to a 9-3 record 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbach could not be reached for comment at his campus fraternity nor was he 
at his mother's home in Pullman this morning. "As far as I know, it's a rumor," 
said secondary coach Craig Bray.
