Earthquakes rank right up there with smog and freeways among everyday topics of 
conversation in L.A., so you knew this happened somewhere: 
</P>
<P>
During a meeting of Pepperdine officials Wednesday afternoon, Jon Crispin, a 
program development director, asked, "What are we doing about earthquake 
safety?" 
</P>
<P>
It was 3:43 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
When the room stopped shaking, someone cracked: 
</P>
<P>
"Why don't you ask about pay raises next?" 
</P>
<P>
Freeway Spill du Jour: About three dozen diapers on the San Diego Freeway in 
West L.A. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic was backed up for two miles. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, they were disposable diapers. 
</P>
<P>
Elvis-Head Sightings (cont.): 
</P>
<P>
It appears to be the end of the line for the 1,400-pound float of the King's 
noggin, which has appeared in the Rose Parade, a 7-Eleven parking lot in 
Memphis and a mall in Ridgeland, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
While the Elvis head drew offers from the Mardi Gras as well as one St. 
Patrick's Day Parade, the Mississippi Tournament of Roses Committee kept it on 
the sidelines after Presley's Graceland estate protested. 
</P>
<P>
"We've decided to dismantle the head," said committee chairman Pat Frascogna. 
"It's too big to keep moving around. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see it being resurrected," he added. "But with the king's staying 
power, you never know." 
</P>
<P>
Big Chicken-Head Sightings: 
</P>
<P>
Elvis' noggin may be gone, but about 30 6-foot-tall cluckers spent Thursday 
afternoon tramping up and down Rodeo Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Were they mutations of the infamous Freeway Chickens who fell out of a truck on 
the Ventura Freeway and took up residence on the roadside in the 1970s? 
</P>
<P>
No, there was a perfectly logical explanation. The chickens were advertising a 
hamburger joint. 
</P>
<P>
The logo wars continue. 
</P>
<P>
In our last episode, you may recall, a First Interstate Bank official wrote a 
letter to the Downtown News in which he criticized the Civic Center logos of 
Bank of America, Security Pacific, Union Bank and Wells Fargo. 
</P>
<P>
His anger stemmed from a series of letters in the Downtown News that 
characterized the "I's" tacked to the top of the 73-story First Interstate 
Tower as corporate graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes the next salvo. One Wilshire Building ran a half-page photo of the 
city skyline in this week's Downtown News. Funny thing: It shows only the first 
72 floors of FIT. That's one way to say nay to the "I's." 
</P>
<P>
There were no 73-floor buildings (or logos) when L.A. City Fire Station No. 29 
opened in 1912. In that low-rise era, ceilings were closer to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Good ol' 29 is still in business on Western Avenue in Hollywood. And the 
equipment has gotten bigger. 
</P>
<P>
So, to prevent firefighters from banging their heads while standing on the 
engines, the station has several printed warnings posted. There are also 
drawings of a critter that deliver the same message: 
</P>
<P>
Duck.

from the county art museum to the downtown Federal Building, where 27 linked 
arms and blocked the entrance in a non-violent demonstration for artistic

MEDFLY SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for your excellent editorial "The Governor and the Medfly" (Feb. 22). 
However, as you suggest, it is probably too late for the governor to be able to 
allay any fears over aerial spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it should not surprise our public officials if their words are met 
with incredulity. After all, they have been lying to us regularly for so many 
years that we scarely believe anything they say. And even I am capable of 
reading the health warnings on the malathion spray I use for my own plants. 
</P>
<P>
It will take more than one honest politician to set our country right. It will 
take nothing less than an American-style perestroika, one which will sweep 
every liar from office, to restore public confidence in our government. I can 
hardly wait.

REAL POTENTIAL FOR DISASTER; 
</P>
<P>
TOUGH TEST FOR BUSH AS U.S.-JAPAN RELATIONS DETERIORATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In talks with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu today and Saturday, President Bush 
may find that the relatively easy ride that he has enjoyed in foreign affairs 
is over and that the hard part has begun. 
</P>
<P>
For Kaifu is bringing more than Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama with him to Palm 
Springs. He's bringing a lot of pent-up emotion and resentment from back home 
over congressional whining about Japan. If Bush breaks form, drops the kinder, 
gentler demeanor with which he has managed to waltz through so many 
foreign-relations problems and indulges himself in tough talk, Kaifu may bow 
politely, but that might not be the end of it. The Japanese can now insist on 
being treated as a full partner in world affairs. Domestic political pressure 
alone will prohibit Kaifu from allowing himself to be lectured to. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that Bush is under similar roiling domestic pressures -- perhaps 
more so. Congress has saddled him with the "structural impediment" talks with 
Tokyo that are aimed at opening up Japanese markets. U.S. negotiators are under 
a gun to reach some kind of final accord in July. Good luck. "Structural 
impediments" were inspired as much by domestic polls that show Americans 
increasingly irritated with Japan as by real barriers to trade. As Fortune 
magazine has put it: "Suddenly the Japanese have become the people it is OK to 
hate." As one U.S. senator said: "In a couple of years it will be as hard to be 
pro-Japanese in public as it was to be pro-Russian in the early '50s." As the 
Economist, the influential London weekly, worried: "A whiff of McCarthyism is 
in the air." 
</P>
<P>
The problem is not only that real issues are involved -- the Japanese market is 
less open than it could be to foreign investment and products, and the Japanese 
play Byzantine games to load the economic dice in their favor. But the Japanese 
question is now a huge political one -- with each side increasingly distrustful 
of the other. The angry swirls of public opinion are starting to narrow 
politicians' options to settle the trade differences rationally. 
</P>
<P>
That's why Bush was right to call for this meeting -- and why it's somewhat 
troubling that Kaifu brought his foreign minister with him but no economic or 
trade officials. Will Kaifu plead with Bush that without his technical advisers 
he can't make concessions? It is a measure of the extent to which American 
officials now distrust the Japanese that the question of stalling can even be 
raised. 
</P>
<P>
In some respects, Japanese-American relations are now Bush's toughest 
foreign-policy challenge to date. He must be straight with Kaifu but not 
grandstand. And the prime minister must understand that the time for stalling 
is over and the latitude for rational discussion may be narrowing. If diplomacy 
fails, the economic war that has been the nightmare of all who care about good 
U.S.-Japan relations may then not be far off.

SHAKEN BUT NOT, ALAS, STIRRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After the 5.5-magnitude reminder that rattled out of Upland Wednesday, you 
would think the state Assembly would have gotten the message about earthquakes 
and buildings that fall down when the ground shakes. But even after some 15 
million Southern Californians were startled and alarmed by yet another quake, 
the lawmakers came within a whisker of killing a proposed $300- million bond 
issue to fix up old government buildings to meet state seismic safety 
standards. The Assembly finally did approve reconsideration of the bond measure 
sponsored by Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), and it may come up again for a 
final vote on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
There is legitimate concern about how much bonded debt the state is incurring, 
but the Torres bill is precisely the sort of program bonds are designed to 
finance. The Assembly must get over whatever political hang-up it that put the 
quake bonds in jeopardy and pass this bill as soon as possible. Senate approval 
of minor amendments and the governor's signature also are needed for the issue 
to go before voters at the June 5 primary. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council is considering a similar measure, a $376-million 
bond issue for reconstruction of city office buildings, fire stations, 
community centers, bridges and other structures to meet earthquake standards. 
It should act quickly on this plan to make certain it also gets on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
But the state measure is particularly urgent. Between 1980 and 1987, the state 
Seismic Safety Commission found that at least a third of 1,350 state buildings 
were unsafe in the event of an earthquake. More than 400 of those were 
high-occupancy structures, including classroom buildings and other facilities 
in the University of California and California State University systems. The 
$250 million in Torres' plan (the other $50 million is for local government 
assistance) will not make all these buildings safe or provide for their 
replacement, but at least it will get the job started. 
</P>
<P>
Any further delay in this quest puts Californians unnecessarily at risk. That 
cannot be tolerated.

FIGHTS SELL TICKETS BUT RUIN GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A hockey game in Inglewood Wednesday night went into the record books when, 
parenthetically, the Los Angeles Kings defeated the Edmondon Oilers, 4-2. 
Eighty-six penalties were issued, smashing the standing National Hockey League 
mark of 84 -- not a record to be proud of. 
</P>
<P>
Wouldn't it be nice if someone cleaned this game up? 
</P>
<P>
A Kings coach later talked about the violence as if it were all part of the 
game. It has become that, sadly, but it doesn't need to be. There's no real 
reason why the NHL has to stage blood baths when the game itself offers so much 
excitement. Sooner or later, failure to stem the violence may indicate that 
something is so wrong with the administration and policing of professional 
hockey that outside authority has to step in: Some city like Los Angeles 
signals an intention to restore hockey's inherent grace and beauty by force of 
law. An aggressive district attorney surely would get some attention by serving 
notice that assault on the ice will result in arrest and prosecution. After 
all, it's hard to imagine the conduct that routinely goes on at NHL games being 
so lightly penalized in any other quarter of society. Other sports can clean up 
their acts, but not hockey. 
</P>
<P>
The league so far has resorted to penalties and suspensions in an unconvincing 
attempt to stem the tide of gouged eyes and broken teeth. That's not enough, 
because the prevailing ethic remains that fights are part of the game. They may 
be box office, perhaps, but it's sure not the game that America grew up playing 
-- and loving.

During the decade of the 1980s, the United States spent billions to carry out 
the war in Central America. Thirty thousand Nicaraguans lost their lives. 
</P>
<P>
We imposed economic sanctions until the economy was reduced to a shambles. We 
mined their harbors in violation of international law, then thumbed our nose at 
the World Court when its decision went against us. Finally, we openly financed 
the political campaign of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro. 
</P>
<P>
If a country we depended on -- say, Japan -- were to cut us off economically, 
finance terrorist attacks against us and fund one party in an election 
campaign, we would be outraged at the violation of international law and 
treaties. We would hardly call the elections free and fair. 
</P>
<P>
We should strive for democracy everywhere in the world. But we should define 
democracy and support it with one set of rules. As we seek to gain the trust of 
our children and encourage moral behavior and raise ethical standards, we must 
not let our hypocritical version of democracy in Nicaragua stand as the 
example.

</P>
<P>
NICARAGUA: WHILE THE PEACE PLAN HAD PLENTY OF SHORTCOMINGS, IT HAS DEMONSTRATED 
THAT THERE IS A VEHICLE FOR ENDING CENTRAL AMERICAN INSURGENCIES AND NURTURING 
DEMOCRACY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM GOODFELLOW, William Goodfellow is director of the Center for 
International Policy, a research institution in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ever since Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez unveiled his Central 
American peace plan in 1987, it has been all things to all people. The Reagan 
Administration, while giving the plan rhetorical support, did its best to 
undermine it. Nicaragua's Sandinistas, skeptical at first, soon embraced it as 
the best way to rid themselves of the Contras and come to terms with 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Now three years later -- and after the Sandinistas' defeat at the polls -- we 
can begin to assess the real impact of the Arias plan. 
</P>
<P>
For Americans, it provided an alternative to the Reagan Administration's 
campaign to militarily overthrow the Sandinistas. It offered an alternative to 
members of Congress who previously had been forced to choose between Reagan and 
the Contras on one hand and Daniel Ortega on the other. Absent a diplomatic 
option, the war likely would have continued. 
</P>
<P>
For the five Central American presidents who signed on, the Arias plan provided 
a framework to resolve regional insurgencies by moving . By simultaneously 
cutting off external aid to guerrillas while guaranteeing their personal 
safety, access to media and right to participate in free and fair elections, 
the plan aimed to move the conflicts from the battlefield to the ballot box. 
</P>
<P>
But as logical as the plan looked on paper, it had major shortcomings. The 
first was its focus on Nicaragua to the exclusion of El Salvador and Guatemala. 
The Nicaraguans felt it was unfair that they had to fully implement the plan 
while far greater abuses of human and political rights were ignored in 
neighboring countries. 
</P>
<P>
The second and even more serious shortcoming was the inability of the Central 
American presidents to get outside powers, in particular the United States, to 
comply with the plan by cutting off aid to guerrillas. Every time the 
presidents met, they pleaded for an end of aid to the Contras. Although 
Congress did end military aid two years ago, so-called humanitarian assistance 
continued to keep the Contras armed, intact and killing Nicaraguan civilians, 
albeit at a much-reduced rate. 
</P>
<P>
The Sandinistas were bitterly disappointed that after signing the Arias plan 
and then taking dramatic steps to implement it, including opening their 
political system and releasing political prisoners, the anticipated aid bonanza 
never materialized. Moreover, the U.S. trade embargo and the U.S.-orchestrated 
credit blockade remained. The Democratic leadership in Congress, so 
instrumental in convincing the Nicaraguans to go the extra mile, never made a 
serious effort to end the financial war. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it was the Democrats who persuaded Daniel Ortega to move up the 
election in order to hasten the day when the blockade would be lifted and aid 
would resume. Standing for election before economic recovery turned out to be 
Ortega's biggest miscalculation. 
</P>
<P>
The magnitude of that miscalculation was revealed by the Sandinistas' 
resounding defeat by the coalition headed by Violeta Barrios de Chamorro. A 
majority of the Nicaraguan voters believed that a vote for the Sandinistas 
would doom them to six more years of misery. Never mind that it might not be 
the Sandinistas' fault. 
</P>
<P>
Where does all this now leave the Bush Administration, the people of Nicaragua 
and the hapless Sandinistas? 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration, committed like its predecessor to destroying 
Nicaragua, now finds itself stuck with the tab for rebuilding that country. The 
cost is certain to run into the billions. An uncertain future faces the 
Nicaraguan people. An unstable coalition headed by a political novice will try 
to rebuild the country's economy and mend its social compact. 
</P>
<P>
For a peek at the likely payoff of close ties with the United States, the 
Nicaraguans need only look next door at Honduras, our closest ally in the 
region, which now finds itself vying with Haiti for the dubious distinction of 
having the lowest per capita income in the hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
And what of the Sandinistas? After they get over the shock of defeat, they may 
realize that they are in the catbird's seat, relieved of responsibility for 
rebuilding the country and well positioned as Nicaragua's biggest opposition 
party. They have enough seats in the National Assembly to block any changes in 
the constitution, they control the biggest labor unions and they are certain to 
have influence in the army. While Chamorro is buffeted about by one crisis 
after another, the Sandinistas can methodically plan for the next round of 
elections in 1996. Like Michael Manley in Jamaica, the odds are that they will 
be back. That is the beauty of elections -- even if you can't win them all, you 
rarely lose them all either. 
</P>
<P>
Imperfect as the Arias plan was, multilateral negotiations remain the best 
vehicle for ending the region's insurgencies and nurturing democracy in 
countries now democratic in name only. Daniel Ortega took the bitter medicine. 
Now the Bush Administration must apply the same cure to El Salvador and 
Guatemala if it ever wishes to attain the goal of regional peace.

PUBLISHING: BY OUSTING PANTHEON BOOKS' DIRECTOR, ITS OWNER CHOSE FREEDOM OF THE 
PROPRIETOR, ABROGATING THE FREEDOM TO PUBLISH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TODD GITLIN, Todd Gitlin, a professor of sociology at UC Berkeley, is the

Sixties: Years of Hope, Days of Rage.

Removing ancient shards from one country to another is an action now recognized 
as cultural theft. Smashing a cultural vessel ought to be recognized as another 
sort of crime against culture. 
</P>
<P>
This is precisely what S. I. Newhouse, whose family owns Random House Inc., has 
committed by forcing the resignation of Andre Schiffrin, Pantheon Books' 
longtime managing director. Insisting on the freedom of the proprietor, 
Newhouse has abrogated the freedom to publish. Random House executives have 
insisted that Pantheon publish far fewer books. As a result, four of the five 
senior editors at Pantheon have resigned in protest. 
</P>
<P>
Why should anyone care? For three decades, Pantheon has been unique in the 
world of commercial publishing. It has made a habit of collecting square pegs. 
It has been an enclave of accessible intellectual seriousness in an industry 
going blind as one eye strains toward Wall Street and the other toward Madison 
Avenue. Many publishers publish significant books, books that stretch the 
boundaries of what is known and discussed. But Pantheon has been singular in 
mainstream publishing -- it devoted itself almost exclusively to the serious 
and challenging book, the book that deserved to be published on its merits. It 
published Art Spiegelman's tour de force "Maus," the brilliant comic book about 
the Holocaust and its crimes against families, after 16 publishers had rejected 
the manuscript. It published path-breaking history: E. P. Thompson's "The 
Making of the English Working Class"; Herbert Gutman's "The Black Family in 
Slavery and Freedom"; John W. Dower's "War Without Mercy: Race &amp; Power in 
the Pacific War"; David Wyman's "The Abandonment of the Jews."

It has imported such Europeans as Gunter Grass, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de 
Beauvoir, Marguerite Duras, Anita Brookner, Eva Figes, John Berger, Gunnar 
Myrdal, Alva Myrdal, Harry Mulisch, Etty Hillesum, Michel Foucault, Peter 
Schneider. It has imported such Latin Americans as Julio Cortazar, Eduardo 
Galeano, Ariel Dorfman, Antonio Skarmeta, Luis Rafael Sanchez and Elena 
Poniatowska. It has published books by George F. Kennan, J. William Fulbright, 
Ralph Nader, Jonathan Schell, Orville Schell; the photography of Walker Evans, 
Annie Gottlieb, Susan Meiselas, Brassai, Robert Frank; the humor of Matt 
Groening, Tom Lehrer, the Marx Brothers and Monty Python, and all the books of 
Studs Terkel. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously not averse to publishing famous names, it has also done the harder 
thing: It has cultivated the little-known, helping some -- such as Terkel -- 
become household names. 
</P>
<P>
But Pantheon did more than acquire. It inspired. Editing, after all, is a form 
of thought, and Pantheon was nothing if not thoughtful. Its editors, mirabile 
dictu, edited -- argument by argument, line by painful line. When senior editor 
Tom Engelhardt edited one of my books, he found within a fat manuscript a 
thinner argument straining to get out, and knew it better than I did. Writers 
gravitated to Pantheon not only from elective affinity -- and certainly not for 
fat contracts -- but because they could learn something. 
</P>
<P>
This is the publishing house that is being gutted because greed apparently 
knows no bounds. 
</P>
<P>
If civic virtue were alive, a proprietor worth billions would let his most 
profitable enterprises subsidize others that serve the public good. He or she 
would take pleasure in a reputation for good works, the sheer prestige of an 
enterprise of Pantheon's standing. After all, in its original meaning, the word 
"enterprise" meant "bold undertaking." Today, Newhouse seems more interested in 
serving as bold undertaker. Last December, Robert Bernstein, chairman of Random 
House, was forced to resign. Bernstein was renowned for his commitment to human 
rights. Now Schiffrin joins him as sacrifices to the greater glory of the 
bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, speaking to a joint session of Congress, President Vaclav Havel of 
Czechoslovakia set out with lovely simplicity this principle: "The only genuine 
backbone of all our actions -- if they are to be moral -- is responsibility. 
Responsibility to something higher than my family, my country, my firm, my 
success." By this standard, the gutting of Pantheon is an act of supreme 
irresponsibility. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Americans have manned the cultural barricades against 
Japanese invaders. "Sony Invades Hollywood," screamed a Newsweek cover last 
fall when the company bought Columbia Pictures. The thought of the Japanese 
buying Rockefeller Center inspired racist jokes. America's corporate gladiators 
have been depicted as heroic defenders of the national patrimony. But here the 
crime against writers -- which is also a crime against readers and a crime 
against public life -- is being committed within our borders, in the name of 
the freedom of the proprietor to abort genuine enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
This has been a good year for celebrating the freedom to write, to read, to 
organize throughout the world. All sorts of walls have fallen. Playwrights and 
musicians helped organize revolutions in Czechoslovakia and Romania; poets and 
essayists ran for Parliament in Hungary. In America, while official celebrants 
crow that the rest of the world is becoming more like us, a light is going out.

CORRUPTION: WHEN A CONTRACTOR LIKE NORTHROP CHEATS ON NATIONAL DEFENSE, WE KNOW 
WHERE OUR REAL ENEMY IS.

This is one of the jokes I heard last week in Buenos Aires while discussing the 
problems of South America over a long barbecue with a bunch of Argentines: 
</P>
<P>
The chief of staff of the Argentine army was invited for a weekend at the ranch 
of his Brazilian counterpart. "What a spread," the Argentine said. "How can you 
afford this on a soldier's pay?" 
</P>
<P>
"See that automobile factory over there?" said the Brazilian, pointing to 
buildings and smokestacks on the horizon. He patted his pocket. "I get 10% of 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
The next year the Argentine general returned the courtesy, inviting the 
Brazilian general to his ranch. "Wow! This is grander than mine," the Brazilian 
said. "How did you do it?" 
</P>
<P>
"See that highway there?" the Argentine said. "No," the Brazilian said. "I 
don't see any highway." 
</P>
<P>
The Argentine patted his pocket and said, "100%." 
</P>
<P>
We all laughed -- me with the expected hint of Yankee superiority. One of the 
assumptions of the telling was that such things are not acceptable in the 
colder and more righteously puritan regions to the north. In fact, one of the 
men there talked about how depressing it had been to come back home to 
Argentina 25 years ago after years of education and work in the United States 
where business was business, just honest supply and demand. 
</P>
<P>
But then I came back home on Thursday to be greeted by the most depressing of 
news about the state of American business and Yankee honesty. In the first 
newspapers I saw, there was story after story about investigation after 
investigation of dishonesty and corruption in places high and low, reaching 
deep into the soul of American business and government. Defense contractors, I 
saw in the Wall Street Journal, were cheating the military; banks were 
knowingly laundering drug money; a date was set for the criminal trial of the 
mayor of the capital city itself; a survey of the National Assn. of Accountants 
showed 87% willing to commit fraud for their bosses or clients. 
</P>
<P>
Most shocking of all to me were the accounts of Northrop Corp.'s deliberate 
cheating of the government on contracts for Air Force missiles and bombers. 
This was not just overcharging -- although Northrop did that on the Stealth 
bomber program; it was the falsification of test data on intercontinental 
ballistic missiles, supposedly the heart of our national defense. 
</P>
<P>
It takes a lot of people to fake test results on such things as guidance 
systems. A lot of engineers. It happened that my Argentine companions around 
the barbecue, the men, were all engineers. So am I, or at least I have a degree 
in mechanical engineering. I mention that because we were trained in numbers; 
we respect the factual results of experimentation and tests -- that is our 
professional religion. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers are usually simpler people than, say, lawyers or investment bankers 
or mayors. There were few slippery slopes in the world of my education. There 
were numbers, knowns and unknowns, variables and invariables. We don't like to 
fudge it. If the culture of Northrop, or of the United States itself, is now 
such that engineers are faking data, we, too, could end up sitting around 
telling bitter jokes and patting our own pockets. 
</P>
<P>
What Northrop and other defense contractors, including General Electric, have 
admitted doing is a far greater danger than anything that the Russians and the 
Japanese could ever do to us. The problem is not being bombed or out-traded or 
cheating the government. Many societies have survived such things. The problem 
is corrupting ourselves, or allowing ourselves to be corrupted by each other, 
rotting ourselves and our ideals from the inside out.

NEW-LOOK OFFENSE, OLD FRUSTRATING RESULT; 
</P>
<P>
CLIPPERS: MANNING COMES OFF BENCH, NORMAN MOVES TO FORWARD, BUT L.A. FALLS IN 
OVERTIME TO HORNETS, 118-109. 
</P>

CHARLOTTE, N.C. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A dreaded word has re-emerged in the Clipper vocabulary, but it's nothing Danny 
Manning can't say on television. Can, but won't. 
</P>
<P>
In the locker room, frustration, when attached to the workings of a basketball 
offense, might be even more profane. Certainly more unwelcome. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Manning was frustrated with the offense Thursday night at Charlotte 
Coliseum, even before the Clippers' 118-109 overtime loss to the Hornets, the 
NBA's losingest team, before 23,901. 
</P>
<P>
And after? 
</P>
<P>
"No comment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't that Coach Don Casey shuffled the lineup and had Manning come off the 
bench, a notion that has never bothered 1988's No. 1 draft choice. The concern 
is ball movement, and when someone suggested to Manning before the game there 
was an appearance of struggling to the Clippers, he didn't disagree. 
</P>
<P>
"Frustration," he said. "But I think it's frustration on all our parts. You can 
look out on the court almost any time and see frustration with the offense." 
</P>
<P>
Manning continued. "It's puzzling." 
</P>
<P>
Then he shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what to say other than that." 
</P>
<P>
At the root, he admitted, is winning, one thing the Clippers (22-34) haven't 
done to gloss over any problems. The streak hit seven defeats in eight games 
and 15 of 19 after being outscored in the five-minute extra period, 13-4, by 
the league's second-lowest scoring team. 
</P>
<P>
The new lineup was the 14th different one for Casey, mostly thanks to injuries. 
This new look was more attributable to tinkering, Ken Norman being moved from 
shooting guard to his more natural small forward and Manning coming off the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
It was back to the forward rotation of old: Manning, Norman and Charles Smith. 
None of the subjects complained, not even Norman, who sat out the entire fourth 
quarter for the second consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to find some way to win," said Norman, who finished with 19 points 
and eight rebounds -- five offensive -- in 28 minutes. "I guess he (Casey) 
feels we can win with that rotation. It worked pretty well. We just didn't come 
out on top. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very tough to do, especially when everyone is playing well. I felt I 
played well in the first two quarters, but so did the others. I can live with 
that as long as the guys in play well. I've just got to be ready when it's my 
time to go in." 
</P>
<P>
It was his time with the game in the balance, an awkward situation for someone 
still nursing a groin injury to jump back in cold. The Hornets (10-44) had a 
9-0 run to finish the game, Rex Chapman hitting a straight away jump shot to 
break a 109-109 tie. Smith fouled out with 2:06 remaining, and Charlotte's 
Armon Gilliam converted both free throws to push the lead to 113-109. Chapman 
followed his own miss with 1:04 left for a six-point advantage, and, when 
Gilliam made another free throw with 26.1 seconds to play, it went to 116-109. 
Tyrone Bogues added the final points on two more free throws with 12.7 seconds 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Casey expects the new lineup to stick, at least for a while. Manning's 
versatility allows him the option. 
</P>
<P>
"He's such a purist, but in a good sense," Casey said. "He knows the game and 
how it should be played. The main thrust, in my mind, is it's better if we have 
a natural guard. Let Snake (Norman) play forward and allow Danny to come into 
his own spots off the bench. Not many players can do that." 
</P>
<P>
The trick, of course, is to make sure Manning gets his minutes. He hasn't been 
getting his shots. 
</P>
<P>
His per-game attempts since the all-star break, in order: nine, nine, eight, 
19, seven, eight, 14, 14 and 17. In that time, he's shot 46.7% and averaged 
14.8 points. 
</P>
<P>
In that time, the Clippers are 1-8. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Coach Bob Staak returned to North Carolina and practically stepped 
into a hornet's nest, as it were. Nearly a year after leaving as head coach at 
Wake Forest, Staak was confronted by revelations of the point-shaving scandal 
at North Carolina State. A report by ABC said one of the games in question 
involved Wake Forest on March 6, 1988. A television crew met Staak Wednesday 
night, and there were more questions Thursday, though none, he said, from 
investigators. "It may be true," Staak said of the allegations, "but until it's 
proven for sure, I won't believe any of it." 
</P>
<P>
Winston Garland got his first start as a Clipper, opening in the backcourt with 
Tom Garrick . . . Benoit Benjamin, showing no lasting effects of flu, had 16 
points and 16 rebounds, but six of the Clippers' 24 turnovers that accounted 
for 32 Charlotte points. Danny Manning also had six turnovers.

They had a Merril Hoge Day in Pocatello, Ida., to celebrate the exploits of the 
former Idaho State running back who ran wild for the Pittsburgh Steelers in the 
NFL playoffs. Even the governor showed up. 
</P>
<P>
The whole thing was such a success, they decided to do it again, holding 
another Merril Hoge Day. 
</P>
<P>
Says Hoge: "We don't have a whole lot to do in Idaho, except ride snowmobiles 
and tackle buffalo."

Trivia time: What college football team has produced three members of the Pro 
Football Hall of Fame? 
</P>
<P>
Joe knows basketball: From Bruce Keidan of the Pittsburgh Press: "During Norm 
Sloan's tenure as basketball coach at North Carolina State, he recruited a 
promising guard from Western Pennsylvania but lost him to Notre Dame, which 
offered him a football scholarship. Sloan still believes Joe Montana could have 
played in the NBA had he not elected to fritter away his life winning Super 
Bowls." 
</P>
<P>
Ouch: Philadelphia guard Derek Smith, formerly of Sacramento, had this to say 
when asked about the Kings' former coach and president, Bill Russell: "I don't 
have a problem with Bill. He treated me the same way he treated everyone else 
-- rude, obnoxious and uncaring." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: University of San Francisco, 1951 -- Ollie Matson, Gino 
Marchetti and Bob St. Clair. The school's sports information director, Pete 
Rozelle, also made it. 
</P>
<P>
Add USF: The Dons, coached by Joe Kuharich, were undefeated in '51 but were 
ranked only 14th. None of the players made the consensus All-American team, 
although Matson led the nation in rushing and scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Add 1951: Two other running backs who would make the Hall of Fame, Hugh 
McElhenny of Washington and Frank Gifford of USC, also failed to make the 
consensus All-American team that year. The backfield was composed of Babe 
Parilli of Kentucky, Dick Kazmaier of Princeton, Hank Lauricella of Tennessee 
and Johnny Karras of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
Add St. Clair: An offensive tackle standing 6 feet 9, he also played on special 
teams for the San Francisco 49ers and one year blocked 10 field goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
He told Dwight Chapin of the San Francisco Examiner that he always accepted the 
salary offers of owner Tony Morabito, but after that season, he said: "I told 
Morabito I wanted the same amount of money Leo Nomellini made. Tony said, 'You 
already make more money than Leo.' So much for that great strategy."

TV-RADIO: IN THE LONG RUN, KCOP'S COVERAGE WILL GO THE DISTANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Channel 13 will go that extra mile in covering Sunday's Los Angeles Marathon. 
KCOP has expanded its live marathon coverage this year from four to five hours. 
</P>
<P>
It will run from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m., instead of from 8 to noon, as it did the 
past four years. The race is scheduled to begin at 8:35 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"The extra hour will give us a chance to go back into the pack and see how the 
ordinary runners are doing," said Rick Feldman, Channel 13 station manager. 
</P>
<P>
"We asked ourselves, 'Is this a race or an event?' " Feldman said. "The answer 
is, it's both, and that's the way we'll cover it." 
</P>
<P>
The marathon telecast will be anchored by running expert Larry Rawson of New 
York, who served as a commentator for the first four L. A. races. 
</P>
<P>
He replaces Barry Tompkins, who had contractual problems. Tompkins is a 
basketball announcer for ESPN, which wouldn't allow him to work the marathon 
because SportsChannel America, a competitor, is sending the Channel 13 feed to 
its nine regional networks outside Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Weidenbach, the country's No. 1-ranked women's marathoner, replaces Nancy 
Ditz as one of the commentators. 
</P>
<P>
Ditz, reached at her home in Woodside, Calif., said race organizer Bill Burke 
didn't like some of her comments during last year's telecast. 
</P>
<P>
"The people at KCOP said they were happy with my work, but I heard last fall 
that Burke was not," Ditz said. "One thing in particular was my comment about 
the prize money. I said $4,000 for third place was far below other major 
marathons. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of ironic. They've raised the prize money to where third place is 
now worth $8,000." 
</P>
<P>
About not being invited back, Ditz said: "I'm disappointed. I really enjoyed 
working the event. But I'm sure Lisa Weidenbach will do a wonderful job." 
</P>
<P>
Another newcomer on the marathon announcing team is Bob Molinatti, who won the 
wheelchair division of the L. A. Marathon in 1986 and '88. 
</P>
<P>
Molinatti, paralyzed in a car accident 12 years ago, lost last year by three 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
This year's wheelchair race will begin at 8:15 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the announcing team includes George Hirsch, publisher of Runner's 
World magazine; running expert Toni Reaves; former world-class distance runner 
Rod Dixon; Channel 13 anchor Wendy Rutledge, and Channel 13 sportscaster Vic 
(the Brick) Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
Hirsch and Rutledge will be at the start and finish lines at the Coliseum, 
Reaves and Dixon will follow the men's leader, and Jacobs will again handle the 
pack-cam. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 13 will have three hours of repeat coverage at 7 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
KNX is offering live radio coverage. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, it appeared as if Jim Hill, popular since the mid-1970s, might be 
in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
For the February 1989 sweeps period, the ratings for the Sunday night sports 
wrapup shows on the three network-owned stations were as follows: Channel 4's 
Fred Roggin, a 7.7 and 24% share of the audience; Channel 2's Keith Olbermann, 
a 4.8 and 15%; and Channel 7's Hill, a 3.4 and 13%. 
</P>
<P>
But during this February's sweeps, Hill and Olbermann flip-flopped. Roggin 
averaged a 7.8 and 22% on Sunday nights during the month; Hill, a 5.0 and 17%; 
and Olbermann, a 3.7 and 11%. 
</P>
<P>
A source at Channel 2 said that despite the ratings drop for Olbermann, he 
still is on fairly solid ground. 
</P>
<P>
However, Olbermann, whose contract reportedly expires this summer, seems to be 
resorting to desperate measures, such as taking potshots at competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Two Sundays ago, he ridiculed the Channel 4 team and last weekend it was 
Channel 7's Todd Donoho. On his opening, Olbermann made fun of Donoho's "Take a 
Hike" segment, and later said: "The producers of the Keith Olbermann Show say 
if you want to listen to a whiny, nasal sportscaster, change the dial now." 
</P>
<P>
And the nightly segment Olbermann calls, "Sports for People Who Don't Like 
Sports," comes across as nothing more than a sarcastic response to someone at 
the station who has told him he needs to appeal to a wider audience. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Olbermann offered a good, moving commentary on Tony Conigliaro -- 
until the end. 
</P>
<P>
He simply took it one step too far, concluding with: "Much in life we are 
angered by. Its cruelties sweep nations and peoples, but the story of how this 
universe teased and tantalized Tony Conigliaro only to punish him for his 
struggles is as infuriating as any. And it makes one want to rage at an 
existence that could be so cruel and so relentless." 
</P>
<P>
It was a classic case of overwriting, something of which Olbermann is often 
guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Wallin, formerly of KABC Radio, is tentatively scheduled to begin a sports 
talk show for a 50,000-watt Las Vegas station, KVEG, March 12. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Grisar of Northridge put together a group of investors to purchase the 
station, which can be heard in 10 Western states. Grisar said the deal was 
completed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Wallin will be the main host of two sports-talk weeknight segments, one from 5 
to 7 and the other from 10 to midnight. 
</P>
<P>
Wallin will work with Joe Salvadore during the first segment and with Peter 
Vent in the second. 
</P>
<P>
Grisar said the idea is to provide competition for KABC's Ed (Superfan) Bieler. 
</P>
<P>
More radio sports talk: It appears that Bud Furillo, another former KABC 
"Sportstalk" host, will soon be moving the show he does with Steve Hartman from 
KFOX-FM in Redondo Beach to KORG in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Furillo, unsuccessful in an attempt to move to KIEV, has Beverly Hills attorney 
Ed Hookstratten, a longtime friend, working on the KORG deal. 
</P>
<P>
Oops Dept.: Superfan recently referred to USC Coach Larry Smith as Larry 
Stewart, of all people. 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
Human runners will be in the spotlight Sunday morning in the Los Angeles 
Marathon, and it will be horses later in the day, as Sports-Channel offers live 
coverage of the Santa Anita Handicap from 4:30 to 5:15 p.m. Of course that's 
not particularly good news for people who are not SportsChannel subscribers. . 
. . The Big 'Cap will be previewed tonight in a one-hour special on KSCI, 
Channel 18. It will be aired at 6:30, before the regular "Racing From Santa 
Anita" replay show. Charleye Wright is the host of the special, with Chris 
McCarron among the guests. 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson, a guest of Connie Chung on CBS Saturday night at 10, says he 
definitely plans to retire when his contract expires in three years and that 
he'd eventually like to own his own NBA team. . . . Kudos to Channel 4 sports 
producer Jeff Hoffman for a powerful piece on the effects of steroid use on 
former pro wrestler Superstar Billy Graham. Graham, at St. Joseph's Hospital in 
Burbank, was shown with rods coming out of casts on his legs after surgery on 
his ankles. Graham said he'd give back all the adulation he got from wrestling 
and taking steroids if he could get rid if the pain he now feels. Graham said 
his joints have deteriorated because of steroid use and he's not sure he'll be 
able to walk again. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN has hired Jim Palmer, former ABC commentator, and Tommy Hutton, a one-time 
Dodger first baseman, as baseball commentators. Hutton was a broadcaster for 
the New York Yankees the past three seasons and was with Montreal before that. 
. . . ESPN has already canceled two spring training telecasts because of the 
baseball lockout. Instead of the Baltimore Orioles and the Yankees on Saturday 
morning, ESPN will offer live coverage of a stock car race in Rockingham, N.C. 
And on Thursday morning, instead of a game between the St. Louis Cardinals and 
the Kansas City Royals, viewers will get repeat programming, including the 1989 
National Old-Timers' game. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Ticket has bowed to pressure and will televise Tony Tucker's comeback 
fight against Mike Evans at the Forum on Thursday night. Prime Ticket had 
scheduled a women's softball game between Fresno State and Nevada Las Vegas. 
But it was pointed out that Tucker was the last guy to dust Buster Douglas, and 
he also went the distance against Mike Tyson. . . . HBO will replay the 
Tyson-Douglas fight at 11 a.m. March 11. HBO will be available to all cable 
homes that weekend, as a free marketing test.

For much of the game Thursday night, the emotional edge belonged to Fresno 
State, whose coach had resigned. But Cal State Long Beach eventually showed the 
most inspiration, coming from 14 points behind to defeat the Bulldogs, 81-75. 
</P>
<P>
It was the sixth consecutive victory for the 49ers, who are 19-7 and 11-6 in 
the Big West Conference. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought our team grew up tonight," Long Beach Coach Joe Harrington said. "We 
were not going to surrender." 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State (9-17, 4-13) was trying to break a five-game losing streak for 
assistant coaches Don Beck and Frank Carbajal, who took over for Ron Adams, who 
resigned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
And the Bulldogs, cheered by an enthusiastic crowd of 9,741 in Selland Arena, 
nearly pulled the upset. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew they'd play great basketball," Harrington said of the Bulldogs, who 
were ahead, 53-39, with about 15 minutes left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach took the lead after Troy Joseph stole the ball and was fouled as he 
drove for a layup with 1:40 to play. He missed the layup, but made two free 
throws to finally put the 49ers ahead, 75-73. 
</P>
<P>
After a missed shot by Fresno, Joseph passed to a cutting Tyrone Mitchell, who 
made a layup with about 50 seconds left, 
</P>
<P>
Fresno's Tod Bernard hit a short jump shot to cut the lead to 77-75, but 
Lucious Harris made two free throws with 20 seconds left. Fresno had another 
chance, but Bernard's three-point attempt went in and out. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, who have shot 63% from the free-throw line this season, made nine of 
10 free throws in the last five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell led Long Beach with 16 points and 10 assists. 
</P>
<P>
"They had something to play for and they didn't have anything to lose," 
Mitchell said. "But we want 20 wins bad." 
</P>
<P>
A loss probably would have severely hurt the 49ers' chances of getting into the 
NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
As has happened many times this season, the 49er reserves came through. 
</P>
<P>
Darrell Faulkner, who made three three-point shots, scored 13 points and 
Frankie Edwards scored 11. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs scored their points three at a time to take an early lead. Dave 
Barnett made a three-point play, Wilbert Hooker sank two three-point shots and 
after another three-point basket by Bernard, the Bulldogs led, 20-11, with 
about 13 minutes left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers committed seven turnovers in the first 10 minutes and made only two 
of six free throw attempts. 
</P>
<P>
With Kevin Cutler making six consecutive foul shots and Darrell Faulkner 
hitting a three-point basket, the 49ers got as close as 36-32. But Fresno State 
went on a 7-1 run to close the half with a 42-33 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs outshot the 49ers from the field in the first half, 56% to 40%. 
</P>
<P>
With Hooker scoring seven points, Fresno State increased its lead to 53-41 five 
minutes into the second half. 
</P>
<P>
But then Faulkner hit two three-point baskets to start the comeback. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers tightened their defense in the second half, holding Fresno State to 
41% shooting from the field.

Brian Hendrick made a three-point play with nine seconds left and California 
rallied from a 16-point deficit to beat Stanford, 66-63, in a Pacific 10 
Conference basketball game Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Hendrick made a difficult 10-foot jump shot to break a 63-63 tie and was fouled 
by Adam Keefe. 
</P>
<P>
The Bear freshman center added the free throw. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford missed a chance to tie the score when Marcus Lollie threw the ball out 
of bounds with one second remaining as he tried to get the ball to Deshon 
Wingate for a three-point shot. 
</P>
<P>
Cal is 21-7, 12-5 in the Pac-10. Stanford is 16-10, 8-9. 
</P>
<P>
The Bears trailed, 48-32, before Keith Smith led them on an 11-minute, 27-11 
run which pulled them into a 59-59 tie with 4:06 left. Smith scored 19 points 
for Cal and Keefe had 20 for Stanford (8-9, 16-10). 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Stanford missed seven of 11 free throws including its last 
five. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Vlahov missed the front end of a one-and-one with 47 seconds left and 
the score tied 63-63, and Cal held ball until Hendrick got off the winning 
shot.

Larry Johnson scored 18 of his 31 points in the second half as No. 2 Nevada Las 
Vegas held off Utah State, 84-82, in a Big West game Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
When the teams played Feb. 1 in Las Vegas, the game ended in a brawl and UNLV's 
Chris Jeter and Moses Scurry were suspended. 
</P>
<P>
Extra security was used Thursday night, but there were no incidents. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels (25-5, 15-2) led most of the way, but Utah State (14-14, 8-9) closed 
within two on Darrel White's three-point goal with 25 seconds remaining. Utah 
State had four shots in the final eight seconds -- including two three-point 
attempts -- but missed all of them. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson scored five points as UNLV broke to a 14-4 lead. Utah State, which made 
seven of 11 three-point attempts, got two three-pointers from Rich Jardine in a 
16-2 run that gave the Aggies their only lead of the game, 37-36, with 3:35 
left in the first half. David Butler then scored four points in a 6-2 UNLV 
spurt that made it 42-39 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Utah State, which has lost 17 in a row to UNLV since the series began in 1982, 
stayed close early in the second half, but the Rebels staged a 9-2 run and took 
their biggest lead of the second half, 72-64, on Greg Anthony's driving layup 
with 8:11 left. 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies staged a 12-5 spurt of their own and pulled to 77-76 on Kendall 
Youngblood's three-point goal with 1:48 remaining. Anthony then made UNLV's 
only three-point goal of the game for an 80-76 lead with 1:26 left. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV missed 12 of 13 shots from three-point range and shot just 28 of 71 
overall for 39.4%. 
</P>
<P>
Butler added 24 points for UNLV. Youngblood scored 19 for Utah State.

RESPECTFULLY SPEAKING, LMU NEEDS SWEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
What does a basketball team have to do to get some respect? 
</P>
<P>
In Loyola Marymount's case, probably win the West Coast Conference Tournament, 
which opens Saturday in Gersten Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions, who lead the nation with a record-shattering 125-point-per-game 
average, are 22-5 and have been on the fringe of the wire services' Top 20 
polls all season. The Sporting News, which prints its own Top 20, ranks the 
Lions 11th. They own road victories over Oregon State and LaSalle, both ranked 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone in the know agrees that the Lions are a lock for an NCAA Tournament 
berth. 
</P>
<P>
But for the sake of getting a good NCAA seeding and a favorable draw, Lions 
Coach Paul Westhead knows the safest route is to sweep through the WCC 
tournament -- which guarantees the conference's automatic NCAA berth -- and go 
into the NCAAs on a roll. Westhead also knows the WCC was unimpressive this 
season and traditionally has not held much weight with the NCAA selection 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll try to finish as strong as possible," Westhead said last weekend. "I 
know one way (to earn an NCAA berth) -- win three games in a row. I'll caution 
our guys nothing's for sure coming out of our conference." 
</P>
<P>
The players are looking to win their third straight WCC tournament, then to 
make an impression in the NCAAs. After two straight NCAA appearances, they say 
they won't be satisfied just getting there. 
</P>
<P>
"We're striving to be consistent, play the style of ball where we can beat the 
Top 10 teams in the NCAAs," Bo Kimble said. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Gathers noted: "We're hoping to run into some of the big teams. It will do 
us justice to knock off some of them. We're looking to do more than just 
getting to the tournament. We've done that the last two years and got knocked 
off early. We should get in and win more than two games." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, when the Lions had a 24-game winning streak and one of the best 
records in the country, they were still accorded little respect in the NCAA 
pairings. They opened against a higher-ranked Wyoming team and beat the Cowboys 
in the opener, then fell to North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Lions -- missing injured starter Enoch Simmons -- had to open 
against a strong Arkansas team and came up short. 
</P>
<P>
This season, the Lions finally seem to be established -- at least in the 
pollsters' minds -- among the nation's top two dozen teams. They made a good 
impression by beating Oregon State and playing tough against Oklahoma when 
Gathers was out of the lineup. They have their deepest team in memory. Other 
coaches around the conference are saying that this team has the best chance of 
any WCC school in recent years to advance to the NCAA's sweet 16, if they 
receive a respectful draw. 
</P>
<P>
To get that, the Lions are probably advised to sweep the WCC tourney again. 
</P>
<P>
A day in the life of Tom (the Human Bruise) Peabody is not like most people's. 
Already nursing a bandaged thigh last Friday against the University of San 
Diego, the Loyola junior raced for a loose ball and ended up trying to vault 
the press table situated under the basket. He found a soft place to land -- 
atop Channel 5 sportscaster Stu Nahan -- but still came down on his wrist. 
After the game he was taken for X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
The next night, against Santa Clara, Peabody appeared with his thigh and wrist 
heavily taped. Midway through the game he skinned a knee and had the bleeding 
joint taped without play even stopping. By the end of the game, he looked like 
Boris Karloff's understudy for "The Mummy." He has to wear a cast on the 
injured wrist when not playing or practicing. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead, who refers to Peabody merely as "Bruise," opened his postgame 
comments by noting wryly: "Bruise survived another game." 
</P>
<P>
Stat of the Week: On Saturday, the Cal State Dominguez Hills women's basketball 
team held a 28-26 halftime lead against Cal Poly Pomona -- the first time they 
had a halftime advantage in the teams' 21 meetings. Pomona, which has a 10-year 
conference record of 102-4, eventually won, 66-46. 
</P>
<P>
Stat II: The Loyola Marymount trio of Bo Kimble, Hank Gathers and Jeff Fryer is 
averaging a combined 87.1 points per game -- more than any other basketball 
team in the West Coast Conference. 
</P>
<P>
College Notes: Cal State Dominguez Hills' Van Girard was named California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. women's basketball coach of the year. The Lady Toros 
were 11-15, their best record in five years. . . . The Loyola Marymount 
baseball team, which lost to UCLA, 9-2, Wednesday, gets back to West Coast 
Conference play with a 2 p.m. game today and an 11 a.m. double-header Saturday, 
all at home against San Diego. The Lions are 8-6 overall, 3-2 in the WCC. . . . 
Loyola outside hitter Sio Saipaia was named Western Intercollegiate Volleyball 
Assn. player of the week for his 35-kill performance in an upset of San Diego 
State. The 35 kills tied the league high this season. The Lions (2-6) play at 
UC Irvine tonight and at UC San Diego on Saturday. . . . Loyola's Bo Kimble was 
named West Coast Conference basketball player of the week for a record sixth 
time this season. The WCC Player of the Year will be announced today. . . . 
Kimble needs 37 points to join teammate Hank Gathers as one of only 13 Division 
I players to score 1,000 points in a season. He's averaging 35.8. . . . Former 
St. Bernard High star Kirkland Howling sank four free throws for Clemson in the 
final seconds Wednesday night to clinch a 97-93 victory over Duke. The win gave 
Clemson at least a tie for its first Atlantic Coast Conference title. Howling 
scored 10 points. Morningside graduate Elden Campbell led the winners with 22 
points. . . . Despite its final 10-17 record, the Dominguez Hills men's 
basketball team still led the CCAA in defense, allowing just 64.1 points per 
game. However, the Toros scored only 61.9. . . . The Dominguez Hills women's 
team led the CCAA in steals with 313. Julie Scott and Brigette Frazier were 
tops with 43 apiece.

MORNINGSIDE TO FACE FORMER TEAMMATE IN 5-AA FINALS

If you can't join 'em, beat 'em. 
</P>
<P>
That would be a fitting motto for Lynwood High senior Linda Watson to carry 
into tonight's Southern Section 5-AA girls basketball final at UC Irvine 
against top-seeded Morningside. 
</P>
<P>
Tip-off is scheduled for 8:30. 
</P>
<P>
Watson, a Parade All-American last season and Lynwood's leader, transferred to 
Morningside as a junior but changed her mind and went back to Lynwood prior to 
the 1988-89 basketball season. 
</P>
<P>
Now an opponent, Watson will be the focus of the Lady Monarchs' defense 
tonight, as Morningside seeks its third consecutive CIF crown. 
</P>
<P>
"We know her; we know she's a good player," Morningside Coach Frank Scott said. 
"Wherever she goes on the court, we're going to try and have a defender in her 
face." 
</P>
<P>
Morningside (27-3) hopes to use its height advantage to neutralize Lynwood's 
high-scoring guards, Watson and Nicole Sanders. Watson averages 21 points, and 
Sanders averages 15 for the second-seeded Lady Knights (25-1). 
</P>
<P>
Morningside's strength is in the front court, led by 6-5 Lisa Leslie (26.2 
points, 15 rebounds, 6.5 blocks) and 6-4 sophomore Janet Davis (10 points, 10 
rebounds, four blocks). 
</P>
<P>
Lynwood's tallest starter is 5-10 forward Kim Barfield. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they match up too well with us inside," Scott said. "We want to 
make them go to the perimeter shot. With Lisa and Janet on the inside, we think 
it's going to work to our favor." 
</P>
<P>
Scott is also confident that point guard Princess Murray, averaging eight 
points and 10 assists, can hold her own with Lynwood's back court. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside has won all three of its previous CIF finals, including a 60-55 
victory over Lynwood in the 1988 4-A championship game. The Lady Monarchs beat 
Fontana, 71-48, for the 5-AA title last season before going on to capture the 
State Division I crown. 
</P>
<P>
Win or lose, Morningside figures to earn a spot in the Southern California 
Division I regionals starting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
West Torrance (23-4), which finished second to Morningside in the Ocean League, 
will play in its first Southern Section girls basketball final at 6:45 tonight 
at Cal Poly Pomona when it faces La Quinta of Westminster (26-3) for the 4-A 
title. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta boasts one of Southern California's top players in 6-2 center Amy 
Jalewalia, the leading scorer in the Southern Section each of the last two 
seasons. The UCLA recruit is averaging 34.2 points. 
</P>
<P>
Jalewalia scored 32 points last week to lead La Quinta to a 60-49 victory over 
North Torrance, the third-place finisher in the Ocean League.

SAN PEDRO ANGLER GETS HOOKED ON FISHING FROM TUBE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It all started in a back-yard swimming pool for 23-year-old float tube 
fisherman Marcus Larson of San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
After watching and talking with float tube anglers at South Bay beaches, he 
decided to give it a try. 
</P>
<P>
He outfitted himself with a float tube that goes around the body's midsection, 
a jacket with pockets and a pair of flippers for propulsion. 
</P>
<P>
After months of practice in a pool, Larson headed to the beaches to fish the 
surf. Now he is a veteran of five years of float fishing. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend Larson loaded his pockets with sand crabs and some cut squid and 
paddled about a half-mile out in calm surf near Manhattan Beach.

He rigged his rod with eight-pound test and peeled out his line. He got 
continuous strikes on his bait, but each time the crabs were taken.

<P>
Larson said he was sure it was a halibut, as he saw a fish spit the hook out 
when it came to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
He pushed out one more time against the current, baited with squid and had a 
bite. He set the hook, and sure that the fish was hooked securely, paddled back 
to shore with a flattie. 
</P>
<P>
The fish weighed eight pounds. Larson was careful not to injure the fish and 
released it. 
</P>
<P>
Larson said float tubers must use caution and not go out when the surf is high 
or the current is strong.

<P>
Larson said someday he would like to try fishing from a surfboard.

EL CAMINO PROVES STRONG 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's clear after two rounds of regional playoffs that 23rd-seeded El Camino is 
the strongest basketball team from the five-member South Coast Conference. The 
Warriors weren't seeded accordingly, but they've proven their strength by 
upsetting two higher-seeded teams on the road -- No. 10 Santa Monica and No. 7 
L.A. City College. 
</P>
<P>
All other SCC teams, though seeded above El Camino, have been eliminated from 
the playoffs. No. 16 Long Beach fell to No. 17 Riverside in the first round and 
No. 21 Pasadena lost to No. 12 Golden West on the same day. On Wednesday, SCC 
champion Cerritos, seeded sixth, was upset by No. 11 Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors have survived two tough rounds, but their biggest test will be 
Saturday when they go to No. 2 Cypress (27-3) for the bracket final. A victory 
against the Orange Empire League champs means a spot March 8-10 in the final 
eight tournament at UC Irvine's Bren Events Center. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino (22-10) will have to play impeccable basketball to obtain its third 
consecutive playoff upset. Cypress, whose coach, Don Johnson, has a 500-208 
record in 23 years at the school, nailed the Warriors 70-49 on Dec. 23. IRENE

ALPHA LEAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Montclair Prep 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Walt Steele, 3rd year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 16-6-1; 1st in league at 10-0 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The team lost just one player from last year's undefeated 
league champion. Granted, it was All-Southern Section pitcher Chris Anderson, 
but the number of proven players should more than compensate. It is still a 
young team: Just three seniors will start. Among them is All-State shortstop 
Keyaan Cook (.500, seven home runs, 35 runs batted in), a Division I prospect. 
The other elder statesmen are pitchers: Kevin Grant, a starter who went 4-2 
last season, and short reliever Scott Saklad (3-1, 4 saves, 1.00 ERA), a 
submarine pitcher. Six juniors will figure prominently. All-league first 
baseman Andy Shaw hit .353. Catcher Brent Polacheck batted .424. Outfielder 
Jared Baumblatt hit .348. How deep are the Mounties? Second baseman Shad 
Knighton (.311) is still battling junior Geoff Taylor for his starting job. 
Basketball star J. T. Billingslea, a "defensive whiz," according to Steele, 
will man left field. Junior football standout Leland Sparks (.322) will patrol 
center field. Sophomore Russell Ortiz, a third baseman and short reliever, is 
perhaps the team's hardest-throwing pitcher. Freshman Chris Garza also will 
pitch. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: It is difficult to imagine this team not repeating a league sweep, 
although Village Christian will provide competition. Still, since the inception 
of the Alpha League, Montclair Prep has either won or tied for seven 
consecutive league titles. "We can't underestimate the league," Steele 
cautioned. "With a streak like that, sooner or later something's going to jump 
up and nip us." 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Baptist 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Joe Koh, 1st year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 15-7; 3rd place in league at 5-5 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Koh means business in taking over the Knights program. His 
list of cuts surprised most with an emphasis on youth in anticipation of a 
"two-year building program." Still, some veterans will provide leadership. 
Among them are senior shortstop and basketball star Reid Chobanian, senior 
outfielder Eric Hein and senior center fielder Chris Robinson, the football 
team's quarterback. Also returning is junior Danny Shackelford (.366, seven 
doubles), who will wind up in the outfield or at second. After that, youth 
reigns. The pitching staff is composed of sophomores Heath McElwee and Darrell 
Smedley and freshmen Steve Klein and John Gabrielson. The rest of the lineup is 
full of new names. Brad Imbler, according to Koh, is a pleasant surprise at 
second base. Catcher Chris Tate is a junior who was handed the job because last 
year's junior varsity catcher chose not to play. Sophomore Justin Simpers will 
play first base. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: In a league with Montclair Prep and Village Christian, L.A. Baptist 
has its work cut out. But Koh, a former assistant at Chatsworth, expects 
success. A realistic goal? "I'd be happy with the team if we finished third and 
made the playoffs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Village Christian 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Mike Henzie, 3rd year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 18-8; 2nd place in league at 7-3 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: This year begins with a note of sadness for Village 
Christian: the Crusaders will not play home games at cozy Bluebird Field. But 
that's all that will be worth grieving over this season: the Crusaders have 
talented players returning -- especially on the mound where four proven 
pitchers will be counted on to carry Village Christian a step past last year's 
semifinal loss. Junior Matt Henzie, the coach's son, will pitch and hit -- he 
batted .500 with four home runs and an .806 slugging percentage last year. 
Junior Matt Smay can perform on the mound and at the plate. The 
shortstop-pitcher was 5-4 with a 2.60 ERA and batted .376 with four home runs 
and eight doubles. Senior Matt Bates went 4-1 with a 3.20 ERA as a junior and 
batted .327. A fourth quality arm comes in Mark Vail, the football team's 
quarterback. In the field, utility man Jeff Cortez will play catcher, replacing 
the injured David Brownfield, who was slated to bat either third or fourth 
before suffering a stress fracture of the spine. First baseman Panos Panay is a 
sharp-fielding player who was promoted from the junior varsity. Herbie Gonzalez 
will play both third base and shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Village Christian poses the greatest threat to Montclair Prep's 
vise-like grip on the league. With four quality pitchers, Henzie exudes 
confidence. "Montclair Prep is no pushover," he said. "But I'd like to think 
title."

Rio Mesa 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Rich Duran, 4th year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 14-10-1; 2nd place in league at 10-3-1 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Rio Mesa lost key players from last year's team that lost to 
Santa Maria, 6-0, in the first round of the 4-A Division playoffs. Gone are 
pitcher John Rust (9-2, 2.52 earned-run average), who is playing for UC Irvine, 
and All-Southern Section second baseman David Frazier (.457). 
</P>
<P>
But Rio Mesa still has its best player, Dmitri Young, and three other returning 
starters. Young hit .500 last year (38 for 76) and was Cal-Hi Sports Magazine's 
Sophomore Player of the Year. He was the magazine's freshman of the year the 
season before. Young has moved from third base to shortstop, and Carlos Rios 
has moved from first to left field. "We're going to have new people all up the 
middle, and there's a concern there," Duran said. Sam Garcia must replace Soliz 
at catcher. David Soliz, a senior right-hander, is the No. 1 starter. "Dave has 
made great strides," Duran said. Henry Wilson, another right-hander, was 5-3 
last year with a 3.80 ERA. Junior right-handers Mike Tinoco and Frank Tinoco, 
unrelated, provide Rio Mesa with pitching depth. Rio Mesa has a quick center 
fielder in Jamie Liddell. Junior Mike Mitchell and sophomores Jeff Flores, 
Jason Guzman and Jon McMullin also will contribute. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "We lost some key people, but I feel pretty good about the kids coming 
up from the JV team," Duran said. He should. The squad was 19-1 last year and 
won the league title. Rio Mesa will be young, but Duran expects the Spartans to 
contend in the always-strong Channel League. "I think we have the personnel, we 
just need to execute," Duran said.

Antelope Valley 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Mike Van Cheri, 1st year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 11-12; tied for 3rd in league at 7-8 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: It's graduation time -- many of the Antelopes move up to the 
varsity. Junior catcher Jack Cox (6-foot-2, 195 pounds) and junior outfielder 
Matt Chaffin (6-0, 175) staged a season-long race for the junior varsity 
batting crown last season. Chaffin came in at .412, Cox at .411. Cox also 
played well behind the plate. "Jack had a good arm last year," Van Cheri said. 
"People didn't try and run on him." Speaking of running, the Antelopes plan to 
do a lot. Junior shortstop Chad Eberhardt, who batted better than .300 last 
year on the JVs, is an "excellent base stealer," Van Cheri said. Junior second 
baseman George Boykins, who will bat leadoff, also is fast. "If he gets on 
base, it's almost a sure double," Van Cheri said. Third baseman Tony Abrams 
(6-1, 200) and first baseman-designated hitter Jade Freeman (6-2, 265), both 
seniors, and sophomore outfielder Fred Edwards (5-10, 170) all played varsity 
football. "We have a heck of a football team," Van Cheri said. "We could line 
up right now." Senior Kevin Branch, a member of the basketball team, serves as 
pitcher, first baseman and dugout comedian. "He hasn't set anyone's foot on 
fire yet," Van Cheri said. Mound duties fall upon senior right-handers B.J. 
Petersen, another basketball player, and David Cook, who played outfield for 
the varsity last season. 
</P>
<P>
Junior right-hander Rick Nickols (6-3, 245) is a hard-throwing reliever whose 
repertoire doesn't include a curve. "He's all fastballs," Van Cheri said. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Speed kills. And the Antelopes hope to hunt down opponents with some 
blazing baserunning. "That's probably our best asset," Van Cheri said. Pitching 
is suspect, but, to the Antelopes' advantage, the center-field fence at 
Antelope Valley is 411 feet from home plate. It's 385 down the right-field 
line, 365 down the left-field line. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Rich Montanio, 3rd year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 14-12; tied for 2nd in league at 10-5 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Pitching is where the Cowboys seem most improved. Last 
season, Canyon posted a team earned-run average of 4.53 and surrendered 209 
hits in 185 innings. This year's staff should be stronger. Senior right-handers 
Scott Thomason (4-4, 3.87) and Eric Rodriguez (4-1, 4.02) both have improved, 
Montanio said. Thomason, with an expanded repertoire, is the No. 1 starter. 
Rodriguez, who also plays first base, is the top reliever. Senior right-hander 
Don Moody (6-0, 170), who started as a sophomore, missed last season because of 
shoulder surgery. Junior right-hander Erik Hilgus (6-4, 200) throws hard. "We 
have more pitching but it's not enough to dominate the league," Montanio said. 
Senior Ben Ealy (5-10, 175, .273) moves from right field to third base. Senior 
designated-hitter Steve Mann (5-10, 185), who is recovering from a knee injury 
suffered while playing football, will see action at first base. Senior Chuck 
Hothan (5-8, 165), who did not play last year, is playing catcher for the first 
time. "He's doing a good job of learning," Montanio said. Junior second baseman 
Oscar Silva (5-8, 150) was the junior varsity's best pitcher last year. Senior 
Lonnie Gonzalez (5-10, 160), a varsity reserve last year, is the team's best 
shortstop in three years, Montanio said. Juniors Chris Stark (LF), Kevin Bialas 
(CF) and senior Roy Bjorklund (RF), a returning varsity player, form a 
completely new outfield. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: With thin pitching last season, Canyon was forced to rely on offense. 
The Cowboys scored at least 10 runs in eight games, including four of their 
last six. This season, "it's gonna be a whole different flavor for us 
offensively," Montanio said. "Probably a line-drive offense and hopefully a 
little bit quicker. I think we'll do better than we did last year." 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Terry Vernor, 2nd year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 12-11; 3rd in league at 7-8 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: None of the Falcons' four returning starters hit a home run 
last year. "We're going to have to manufacture some runs," Vernor said. Senior 
Jeff Mapson (5-10, 185), a three-year starter who moves from first base to 
catcher, batted .258 in league play last year. Senior outfielder Mike Payne 
(5-9, 200) batted .324 but knocked in only seven runs in league play. 
Left-handed first baseman Travis Wilson (6-1, 205), one of four junior 
infielders, has the most power. Junior left-hander Chris Tampoya (5-9, 160), 
who was 2-3 with a 2.90 ERA last year, is the No. 1 starter. "For a little guy, 
he throws reasonably hard," Vernor said. Senior right-hander Jim Carson (6-2, 
200), who was 1-0 with a 5.50 ERA in part-time duty, "depends more on 
location." Senior right-hander David Mosher (6-1, 200), who was 0-0 with a 2.33 
ERA, rounds out the three-man rotation. Junior third baseman Scott Reusser 
moves up from the freshman team. Second baseman Jeff Pica, who was used 
primarily as a pinch-runner last season, and shortstop Jason Rose, up from the 
freshman team, are both switch-hitters. Senior Kim Lawson, a versatile fielder, 
missed last season because of a knee injury. "He's going to play somewhere," 
Vernor said. "He might play third base, he might play outfield, but he's going 
to play." Senior outfielders Jim Ortega, David Mount and John Johnson, a 
three-sport athlete, did not play last season. "We're in need of help in the 
outfield," Vernor said. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Palmdale may be forced to nickle-and-dime its way into the playoffs. 
"We're not going to overpower anyone," Vernor said. "But I think we have some 
good hitters, one through seven, in our lineup. I would say our strength is our 
speed and balance." The Falcons also have as much experience as any team in the 
league with the exception of Quartz Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Quartz Hill 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Stan Lyons, 1st year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 7-14; tied for 5th in league at 4-11 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The Rebels have 13 players returning, more than any team in 
the league -- maybe the Valley area. The problem is that many are untested. 
Seniors Rene Varela, a right-hander, will be the No. 1 starter. Senior 
left-hander Tony Rizza and junior right-hander Ron Turner, both of whom played 
sparingly last season, are battling for the second starting job. Also battling 
for starting duties are senior first basemen Andy Putnam and Jimmy Weese. "One 
will play first base, the other will DH," Lyons said. Senior shortstop Jason 
Haner, who batted .370 in American Legion last summer, is the team's best 
hitter. Senior third baseman Kendial Armstrong, the school's quarterback, 
batted a team-high .328 last season. Seniors Roy Brown (center field), who 
batted .300, and catcher Terry Thompson are returning starters. Junior 
outfielder David Nelson, a transfer from Carson, is a probable starter in the 
outfield and will be used as a reliever. Sophomore left-hander Mike Casuncad, 
who joined the varsity late last season, is another candidate for relief duty. 
Sophomore outfielder Chad Goodwin batted .400 for the frosh-soph team last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: The Rebels' strengths are pitching and defense. "I would say there 
should be great improvement," Lyons said. "And we're going to be a running 
team, offensively." That might be advantageous in a league with few proven 
catchers. And Lyons, a former assistant at Palmdale, should know the league 
well enough to capitalize. 
</P>
<P>
Saugus 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Doug Worley, 15th year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 23-5; 1st in league at 13-2 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The big question in Saugus: How will Saugus fare without 
Roger Salkeld (30-7, 404 strikeouts, 0.68 ERA in three years), now a member of 
the Seattle Mariners' organization? "He's gone," Worley said simply. "You can't 
look back and we don't." With no declarative successor, mound duty will be 
divided among six young pitchers. Junior submariner Doug Maggiora (6-3, 175), 
who logged less than six innings last year, is the most experienced and "the 
one we'll probably count on," Worley said. Senior Shawn Holt, junior Chris 
Pendleton, and sophomores Jaimie Riggio, David Weeg and Chris Hernandez, a 
left-hander, all will throw. "They're young," Worley said, "but they're 
talented." Senior catcher J. B. Johnson (6-1, 195, .393, four home runs, four 
doubles) arguably is the league's best catcher and premier power hitter. Senior 
shortstop Walter White, who did not bat last season, is the only other 
returning starter. Senior third baseman Chad Hankinson (6-0, 175), who batted 
.500 with six doubles, four home runs and 35 RBIs for Grace Community, is a 
welcome transfer. Senior center fielder Pat Henry, an all-league wide receiver 
on the football team, will anchor the outfield. Left-handed twins Jeff (left 
field) and John Albert (designated-hitter) both swing the bat well. Sophomore 
John Lopata is the likely first baseman. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Without Salkeld's sizzling fastball the Centurions, who reached the 
3-A final last season, won't be as overpowering. But Worley is excited about 
the team's young pitching staff. "If I was someone else, I wouldn't believe 
we'd be any good," Worley said. "But we're excited and we think we'll be pretty 
respectable." The Centurions always seem to have an abundance of pitching. 
Hitting is a question mark.

Camarillo 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Jack Willard, 1st year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 12-13; tied for 4th in league at 5-7. 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Willard was the coach of the girls' softball team until he 
accepted the baseball coaching position this season. He takes over a young team 
that has only three returning starters. Matt Tackett (.358) is a returning 
all-league first baseman who was also 3-3 with a 3.61 earned-run average. "He 
is outstanding offensively and defensively," Willard said. Mike Muncy, a junior 
shortstop, is another returning starter and catcher Mitch King was a part-time 
starter in the outfield last year. The rest of the players are primarily from 
last year's junior varsity. Senior Eric Raba, a 6-2 right-hander, is 
inexperienced but will be Camarillo's top pitcher. "He's our mainstay," Willard 
said. Juniors compose the remainder of the pitching staff: Tajah Merrill, Fred 
Tepesano, Danny Haas, and Mike Waid. "They're pretty young, but they're going 
to get an opportunity to pitch," Willard said. Camarillo has some speed in 
outfielders Tim Cornish, Mark Lindbloom and David Nathaniel, as well as in King 
and Muncy. "We run pretty well," Willard said. Junior Corey Tucker will play 
second base and junior Robert Sanchez is at third. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Camarillo may overcome its youth with talent. "I think we'll be able 
to play pretty well," Willard said. Camarillo has pitching depth, but the key 
will be defense. "If we play defense like I think we're capable of playing, it 
might smooth over some of our rough spots," Willard said. "Our offense is going 
to be OK and our pitching is going to be in the strike zone. Now it's just a 
matter of how we field the ball and throw people out." 
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Don Cardinal, 24th year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 6-17; 7th in league at 2-10 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Channel Islands used to be a power in the 1970s but has not 
won a league title since 1979. There are 12 juniors on the team. Junior center 
fielder Jacob Cruz (.377), a starter since his freshman year, could be the 
finest outfielder in Ventura County. A pair of right-handers, sophomore Angel 
Aragon and senior Manuel Padilla (1-1), lead a thin pitching staff. Cardinal 
says Aragon's fastball approaches 80 m.p.h. Senior George Alvarado will move 
from second base to shortstop, a position John Johnson mastered before 
graduating to Ventura College. Cardinal also expects a strong contribution from 
junior outfielder John Bogges. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Cardinal says the Raiders will be better, but he isn't sure how much. 
"It's still early, but we're optimistic," he said. "Our pitching will be fair 
to good, and I think we'll be hitting the ball better as the season goes 
along." Cardinal says he needs anywhere from 22 to 25 wins to reach 400 in his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Gary Fabricius, 4th year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 19-5; 2nd in league at 9-3 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Only four players return from last year's team, which lost in 
the second round of the 4-A Division playoffs. "We were senior-dominated last 
year, but we have some pretty good players coming back," Fabricius said. Those 
include left fielder Brian Smith, designated-hitter/outfielder Ron Spaeth, 
Chris Marsden and Shane Gallimore. Marsden, who bats left-handed, and 
Gallimore, who bats right, will fill the left side of the infield. Junior Jason 
Cash provides depth in the infield and Tighe Harrell will play first base and 
pitch. Junior Mark Wilson will platoon at first base. Seniors Jason Kernan, 
Andy Moffat, Derek Bovard, and Matt LaBelle compose the pitching staff, which 
has its work cut out in replacing the graduated Jeremy Dewey (8-3, 2.52 ERA) 
and Tim Beal (5-0, 2.29). Jon Jerotz and Jason Sands are fighting for the 
catching job. Jai Johnston and Jason Smith add speed and depth in the outfield 
and may work into starting positions. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Newbury Park is young and inexperienced and is a member of an 
unforgiving league. "With that combination, you really don't know how good you 
will perform," Fabricius said. "We look good in scrimmages, but we'll know a 
lot more after this weekend." That's because Newbury Park will play five games 
in the the 32-team Loara tournament. "That tournament is usually a good measure 
of whether you can battle in the Marmonte League," Fabricius said. 
</P>
<P>
Royal 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Dan Maye, 1st year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 12-17; 6th in league at 4-8 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Royal's top offensive threat, Jason Jones (.446, nine home 
runs, 27 RBIs) graduated. But Royal retained its best pitcher, left-hander Bill 
Egan (4-6, 2.32). "Egan is our mainstay, but the rest are unproven," Maye said. 
Tim DelMonte and James Tosh are contenders for the No. 2 slot. Gilbert Renteria 
(4-1, 3.27) will move to the bullpen. Senior Sean Mitchell has moved from 
shortstop to second base. Royal will have outstanding speed in sophomore left 
fielder David Landacker and right fielder Tony Liming, who stole 22 bases last 
year on the sophomore-freshmen team. Senior Richard Naranjo (.302) returns at 
third base, senior Steve Kinnaman will start at shortstop. Three juniors named 
Steve are contending for the starting catcher position: Steve Talafuse, Steve 
Bernstein, and Steve Prentice. Center fielder Robert Campos has good speed and 
a strong arm. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Maye, 27, says his goal is to change the attitude at Royal. "We're 
going to concentrate on playing aggressive baseball rather than think about 
winning," he said. "If we go out and play solid baseball, the winning will take 
care of itself." Expect to see more hit-and-runs than home runs. "If we sit 
back and wait for the two-run home run, we'll be in trouble," Maye said. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Mike Scyphers, 12th year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 23-4; 1st place in league at 10-2 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: It appeared as though this would be the first year Simi 
Valley didn't have a name like Scott Radinsky, Scott Sharts, or Tim Laker in 
the lineup. Then Brian Vasey transferred from Carlsbad High, the San Diego City 
2-A champion last year. Simi Valley also has Kenny Hood, a 6-4 senior 
left-hander (3-1, 1.56 ERA) who is one of the league's finest pitchers. Hood 
also hit .380 last year as a second-team All-Ventura County first baseman. Jeff 
Sommer, a three-year starter, is an all-league power-hitting outfielder who 
also might pitch. "He has a tremendous arm," Scyphers said. "If he comes around 
as a pitcher, it will be a big boost." Brandon Banaga is a returning starter 
who was honorable mention all-league last season. Tyler Nelson, a junior, was 
promoted from the junior varsity midway through last season and will play 
third. Joe Gordon, a senior, has moved from first to second base. He hit two 
home runs in a doubleheader scrimmage against Rio Mesa. James Manzi, a 6-3 
junior, will play the outfield and pitch. Junior Derek Rushton was the 
projected starting shortstop before Vasey transferred, but Scyphers will move 
Rushton to outfield. Kris Kirksey transferred from Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Simi Valley will be a tough out. "Offensively, we'll be as good as 
we've ever been," Scyphers said. "Our two through seven hitters are capable of 
hitting the ball out of the yard." Yet Scyphers is still searching for a 
leadoff hitter and he isn't comfortable with his pitching staff. "Kenny Hood is 
as good as any pitcher in the league," he said. "After that, we have unproven 
talent." Simi Valley will play in the 32-team El Segundo tournament, beginning 
today, and the Las Vegas Chapparal tournament from April 12-14. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Jim Hansen, 16th year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 16-10; 3rd in league at 7-5 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The Lancers are loaded with talented juniors, many of whom 
played on a Conejo Valley Senior League team last summer that won the Southern 
California championship. And, after years of thin pitching depth, Thousand Oaks 
finally has a quality staff. John Bushart (6-3, 1.83), is pitching for Cal 
State Northridge this season, but Thousand Oaks will be long on arms with 
senior left-hander Scott Barkman (2-0), and juniors Tony Siegel, Chris Loll, 
Adam West, Mike Lee, Nick Brown and Jeff Naster. Thousand Oaks has strong 
hitting from a group of five senior returning starters: Barkman (.365), left 
fielder Lance Martin (.364), shortstop Mike McNellis (.300), third baseman Bill 
Hall (.500) and center fielder Brent Christensen (.280). Junior Brian Sturges 
(.385) is recovering from an arm injury and could miss much of the season. 
Catching will be Hall and junior David Skeels. Junior infielders Jason 
Goldstein and Ryan Kritscher are pushing for starting positions, and juniors 
Brian Capella and Bryan Corey are talented and versatile. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: The Lancers could be the team to watch this season in the Marmonte 
League. "We're confident that we have one of our better teams," Hansen said. 
Thousand Oaks is strong up the middle and has good pitching, but Sturges' 
injury could hurt the Lancers at catcher. Hansen feels most teams in the league 
will be able to contend with a Simi Valley team that has won the past four 
league titles. "They don't appear to have two superstars who can blow you out 
of your shoes like they have had in the past," Hansen said. Thousand Oaks has 
lost in the first round of the 5-A playoffs four consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Rich Herrera, 2nd year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 11-13; tied for 4th in league at 5-7 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Eight of 10 returning players are starters. Westlake has a 
1-2 punch of left-hander Mike Eby (6-5, 1.61 ERA) and right-hander Scott Lerner 
(1-4, 2.04), both of whom mix their pitches well. "Eby has developed some pop 
in his fastball and Lerner has a bigger upper body," Herrera said. James Clark 
and Donnie Hill also will pitch. Catcher Mike Lieberthal (.408), who has made 
an oral commitment to play at Arizona State, may be the league's best 
all-around player. Tim Falsken (.278), a junior, moved from second to shortstop 
and Rick Walters, a backup to Lieberthal, is at second. Keith Hess will start 
at third base. Juniors Dave Monheim and Derek Stien provide pitching depth. 
Outfielders Rob Neal, Keenan McAluney, Matt McHenry and Shawn Howard give 
Westlake plenty of speed. James Jones, whom Herrera said would start at 
shortstop if Falsken weren't so talented, will provide depth. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Westlake committed more errors than a bad circus act last year. 
Herrera estimated that 10 to 12 of Westlake's losses were by two unearned runs 
or less. Westlake had 40 errors in 24 games. In a 13-10 loss to Newbury Park, 
all 13 Panther runs were unearned. Therefore Herrera has concentrated on 
fielding fundamentals. "If we don't get them out, we can't hit," he said. If 
Herrera corrects the Warriors' defensive woes, Westlake will be a contender.

<P>
In successive years, Mt. Carmel went from holding the keys to the section to 
watching as the locks were changed. Now what for an encore? 
</P>
<P>
Tonight at 6, top-seeded Mt. Carmel (21-5) meets second-seeded Santana (24-4) 
in a rematch of the 1988 San Diego Section Division I girls' basketball final, 
which Mt. Carmel won, 57-47. 
</P>
<P>
The Sundevils danced with history then. But a year later, they tripped over 
their own feet, losing to Santana, 54-46, in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
It was in a semifinal two years ago that Mt. Carmel was able to do something 
that hadn't been done in the section playoffs for three years and hasn't been 
done there since: defeat Point Loma. The Pointers had won three consecutive 
section, Southern California Regional and state Division I championships. The 
upset was one of the biggest of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday in a semifinal against Poway, a team it had beaten only once in four 
meetings this season, Mt. Carmel again scored a magical victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We hate drawing parallels," Mt. Carmel Coach Peggy Brose said. "Beating Point 
Loma, that was special and emotional for us. Poway was the emotion this year." 
</P>
<P>
It was so emotional that Santana Coach Wade Vickery said Mt. Carmel should be 
content with it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they should be satisfied with that, then take it easy on us," he said. 
"They won the Poway championship." 
</P>
<P>
And about that beachfront property in Arizona . . . 
</P>
<P>
Brose said she discussed the possibility of a letdown with her players at 
length. 
</P>
<P>
"We said let's not be content with that," she said. "We put Poway in 
perspective. You don't play just to get to the final. So there's no problem 
with motivation." 
</P>
<P>
Four of the players in this final saw considerable playing time in 1988: junior 
Vicki de Jesus (5-8, 17-point average) of Mt. Carmel and three from Santana: 
senior Rebecca Aase (5-8, 19) and juniors Stephanie Thompson (5-10, 18) and 
Desiree Weimann (5-4, 18). 
</P>
<P>
Vickery said it will help to have three girls who are experienced and not in 
awe of reaching a section championship. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Carmel is concerned with all three but especially Weimann. She was missing 
when Mt. Carmel defeated Santana, 58-54, in December. 
</P>
<P>
"She's the floor leader," Brose said. "She makes them go. I've seen them play 
with her and without her. They have a hard time carrying the floor without 
her." 
</P>
<P>
Santana primarily wants to keep de Jesus in check. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want de Jesus to go crazy on us," Vickery said. KIM Q. BERKSHIRE

Crescenta Valley 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Tony Zarrillo, 2nd year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 12-13; tied for 3rd at 8-7 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: After a sluggish start, the Falcons came on strongly and made 
the playoffs last season. That momentum could continue if oft-injured Shane 
Cowsill, who pitches and plays first base, can remain healthy. Despite a 
spectacular sophomore season in which he drove in 39 runs, Cowsill tailed off 
and hit .293 last year. Eric Berger, a right-handed senior, also will pitch and 
play several infield positions. The pitching staff includes Brian McBride and 
left-hander Henry Fernandez and is coached by ex-minor leaguer Steve Rousey. 
"He's done wonders with our kids," Zarrillo said of Rousey. Defensive 
specialist Ernie Diaz will play second and Mike Johnson, a rangy senior, will 
start at shortstop. Fernandez will help out at first. Crescenta Valley's 
outfield is green but includes speedy Damon Martin and Scott Anderson, the most 
valuable junior varsity player last season. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Things might be looking up for the Falcons. Said Zarrillo: "We're 
deeper than last year and we're a better hitting team than last year -- with 
only two kids over .300, you don't have to go too far. . . We're going to try 
to steal more, take the extra base." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Chris Axelgard, 3rd year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 10-12-1; 4th in league at 5-10 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Glendale, which boasts 11 seniors, has no shortage of 
experienced players. A sub-.500 season last year leaves some doubt about the 
players' ability to win, however. "Having experience and experience winning are 
two different things," Axelgard said. Brent Overfelt, a three-year starter who 
will play third, center field and pitch, is perhaps the Dynamiters' most 
versatile player. Catcher Jon Strauss and right fielder Marco Rivas also have 
played three seasons of varsity ball. Sophomore John Aguilar, who moved from 
left field, will play shortstop. "He's a very hard worker," Axelgard said. "He 
doesn't have a lot of all-out speed, but he reacts to the ball well." Bill Kirk 
was promoted from the junior varsity to play first, and Mike Thomas will play 
second. Lance Evans, a transfer from Burroughs, will play third and pitch. When 
he is not pitching, Danny Gray will play center field. Gray, the top man in the 
rotation, throws heat but has also honed his curve during the winter. Curtis 
Jung, a hard-throwing right-handed senior, will also pitch, but he has been 
bothered recently by a sore shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Axelgard has a soft spot for this team. "I came in with this class, so 
it's an exciting thing," he said. The Dynamiters are short on power, Axelgard 
adds, but long on savvy. They will need some know-how to weather March -- 
Glendale begins with eight consecutive away games and will not play at home 
until March 27. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Bob Cooper, 15th year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 13-8; tied for 3rd at 8-7 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Returning for his final season is standout first baseman 
Mickey Moreno, who has started for the past three seasons and is the class of 
the league at his position. Moreno batted .476 last season with 22 RBIs, nine 
doubles and four home runs. Other impact players include shortstop Bryan Day, 
third baseman Jose Robles and pitcher Kevin Deitch. Day is strong on defense 
and Robles batted .297 -- second highest among returning players. Deitch, a 
right- handed sophomore, relies on a wicked curve to frustrate batters. Fellow 
sophomore right-hander Young Park joins Deitch on the pitching staff as do Jose 
Gonzalez, Mike Evans and left-handers Ernie Zavala and Rob Walley. Walley might 
be a pleasant surprise. "He reminds me of (Philadelphia Phillies pitcher) Wally 
Ritchie," said Cooper, who coached Ritchie at Hoover. Cesar Covarrubias moves 
up from the junior varsity to catch. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Hoover has a deep pitching staff but is otherwise green. The Tornadoes 
might have some power, however. "We've got some bigger kids," Cooper said. 
"Maybe we'll eventually catch up with those Arcadia kids. We're always the 
smallest team."

<P>
COACH: Dave Johnson, 1st year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 10-12-1; 4th in league at 6-9 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The Bulldogs need a pair of pitchers' arms to heal in a 
hurry. Senior right-hander Jeremy Sparks, a returning starter who batted .500 
last season, is raring to go. But senior left-hander Brian Gordon (6-2, 190) 
and junior right-hander Joon Kwon are nursing injuries. Gordon suffered a 
shoulder injury during football season and will be the designated-hitter until 
he is able to throw. Kwon, a potentially overpowering submariner, is recovering 
from a sprained back. Left-hander Jason Chandler and right-hander Shawn 
Williams throw hard, Johnson said, but are rough around the edges. "At this 
point, I don't want to say we're going to be strong in pitching," Johnson said. 
He might be wise to reserve judgment on his fielders too. Players are battling 
for positions throughout: Chandler and junior Jeff Kadis at first base; juniors 
Teddy Gonzalez and Steve Rutkoske, both up from the junior varsity, at second; 
Sparks, Williams and junior Andy Salazar, at third. Senior catcher Steve Kelley 
(6-0, 200), who batted .330 last season, is a returning starter. Senior center 
fielder Brian Miclette is a first-year starter, and juniors Ozzie Areu, Ryan 
Woodburn and Jason Miller are vying for outfield positions. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Johnson inherited a program that he claims was in disarray. 
Consequently, he is aiming for long-range goals. "We're looking to turn things 
around, but the emphasis is going to be on doing things right," he said. "We'll 
field the ground ball, hit the cut-off man and pick off people. . . . It's a 
big mistake to set goals that are unrealistic, but we're going to be 
competitive." 
</P>
<P>
Burroughs 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Coach Terry Scott, 1st year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 15-12; 3rd in league at 9-6. 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The team's top six batters graduated, and most of the current 
Indians spent last season on the junior varsity. Only three varsity players 
return and all were sophomores last season. Second baseman Mike Medina and 
shortstop Eddie Gavilan, both 5-foot-8, form a tiny but tight double-play 
tandem. "People will be amazed at what they do," Scott said. "They're good and 
they're very tough at the plate." Catcher Bobby Sherwood (5-10, 185) was a 
backup last year. Lanky right-handers Mike Rossiter (6-5, 185), a junior, and 
Mike Ewalt (6-4, 160), a side-arm senior, were the junior varsity's top 
pitchers last season. Junior third baseman Alex Megas (5-7, 145) pitched and 
played shortstop for the junior varsity. Junior first baseman Mike Campbell 
(6-1, 160), a potential power threat, moves up from the sophomore team. Junior 
Andy Young (5-10, 160), a right-handed reliever, batted .400 on the junior 
varsity last season. Senior outfielder Steve Bowler (5-10, 165) led the junior 
varsity with four home runs. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "I've got a certain amount of optimism this year, but we could be real 
tough next year," Scott said. The Indians are inexperienced, but their pitching 
might surprise. "I'm being a little prejudiced," Scott said, "but I think Mike 
Rossiter will be one of the best juniors in the Valley." Defense will make or 
break Burroughs. 
</P>
<P>
Hart 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Bud Murray, 4th year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 23-7; tied for 1st in league at 10-5. 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The Indians arguably have the Valley's best starting rotation 
in senior left-hander Andrew Lorraine and junior right-hander Keith Halcovich, 
both returning starters. Murray called Lorraine (9-5, 2.18 ERA), who combines 
an 80-plus m.p.h. fastball and a good curve, the best left-hander he has 
coached. Halcovich (9-2, 1.28) might be even better. Senior right-hander Kevin 
Foderaro, who registered a late-season shutout and a save after moving up from 
the junior varsity, is the relief ace. Six starters graduated, but the Indians 
have talent where they need it. Line-drive hitting Lance Migita (.447, 13 
doubles, three triples, 31 RBIs) moves from outfield to second base. Shortstop 
Rob Davis (.426, 30 RBIs), like Migita, enters his fourth varsity season. 
Senior third baseman Chad Miyata and junior first baseman R. J. Simone, who 
missed last season because of a broken leg, round out the infield. Junior 
catcher Tom Wolff, who started on the junior varsity last season, replaces the 
departed Casey Burrill. The outfield is new and untested, featuring seniors 
Garrett Emeterio and Sean Buck, both up from the junior varsity, and senior Les 
Holmes, a varsity reserve last season. Sophomore Doug Distaso, the quickest of 
the crew, is the likely starter in center field. Juniors Damon Mori and Joey 
Freitas, as well as Halcovich, also will play the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Murray is amazed at prognostications favoring Hart. Despite the loss 
of several key players, however, the Indians look a heap better than their 
league foes. "I don't know how they figure that," Murray said. "But I think the 
longer we play, the better we're going to get."

Moorpark 
</P>
<P>
COACH: David Rhoades, 1st year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 15-7; 2nd in league at 10-5 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: If nothing else, the Musketeers should be a harmonious bunch. 
Rhoades, Moorpark's junior varsity coach the past three seasons, is in his 
fourth season with several players. Senior right-hander and three-sport athlete 
Robert Hernandez (6-3, 190), who was 7-4 with a 3.38 earned-run average and 
three saves in '89, and junior right-hander Brad Taylor (5-11, 175), who was 
6-1 for the junior varsity, form a solid rotation. Hard-throwing senior Jake 
Sepulveda (6-4, 270), a right-handed reliever, "will be my Goose Gossage," 
Rhoades said. Senior left fielder Andy Richter (5-11, 175, .328, four triples) 
and senior second baseman Mike Zamrock (5-9, 155), a "get-on-base type guy," 
Rhoades said, are both returning all-league selections. So are senior shortstop 
Frank Fernandez (.507) and senior third baseman Tom Uphoff (.397). Both, 
however, are academically ineligible and will not return until at least the 
season's seventh week. Juniors Chuong Ho and Jim Loosbrock, who batted .400 to 
lead the junior varsity, are their replacements. Senior first baseman Mike 
Granderson (6-3, 180) is a returning starter. Senior Chris Boyer (5-9, 155), 
who platooned at second base last year, will be a utility player. Senior 
left-hander Rey Gonzalez, who sat on the bench last year, will see relief duty. 
Junior center fielder Greg Burns (5-9, 150) has good speed. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "A lot of our success will depend on our juniors if they can make 
adjustments to the varsity," Rhoades said. Moorpark's strength is its pitching 
staff, which is better and deeper than others throughout the league. 
</P>
<P>
Oak Park 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Scott Randles, 1st year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 8-12; 5th in league at 5-10 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The fact that Randles considers juniors Jason Kane, a 
power-hitting second-team all-league center fielder, and shortstop Zach 
Sterling, a returning starter, his "team leaders" gives indication of the 
Eagles' inexperience. Senior right-hander Ben Feick (6-foot-5) will play first 
base and enter as the No. 1 reliever. Left fielder Erik Cass, a returning 
starter, is the only other senior. Sophomore right-hander Jeff Gibbons, who 
joined the varsity near season's end last year, is the best of an untested 
staff, Randles said. Junior third base man Art Kahn, another power threat, and 
sophomore second baseman Eric Pryor, a versatile fielder, round out the 
infield. Speedy junior Chris Ruhle, a wide receiver on the football team, will 
play right field. Junior catcher Tom Watson (5-10, 180), another JV graduate, 
is the starting catcher. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "We'll probably get off to a slow start, but I think it will be a 
positive experience," Randles said. A third-place finish would rate a 
successful season.

<P>
COACH: Harry Morgan, 2nd year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 1-7, tied for 5th in league; 5-12 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Once basketball season ends -- seven baseball players are 
competing for Faith Baptist in the Southern Section 1-A Division basketball 
final today -- the Con tenders should be in great shape. Pitching should be a 
strength behind returning right-handers Darren Wyre, a sopho more, and Wes 
Doll, a senior. The pair also will rotate at second base. Robert Reed, one of 
the three seniors on the team, will catch. Peter Rasmussen, a sophomore, will 
start at first base. Alex Estrada, a sophomore standout on the basketball and 
football teams, is expected to start at short stop. "The guy's phenomenal," 
Morgan said of Estrada. "He hits a ton, he's fast and he has a great arm." Chad 
Watkins returns at third. James Carrier, Bobby Bowen, Fernando Garcia and 
Thadius Stout are competing in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Despite the team's poor finish last season, Morgan is confident it 
will gel. "The top three teams make the playoffs and I think we'll do it this 
time," he said. "We were never really out of a game last year, even though we 
had a lot of young players on the team." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell Hall 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Mike Wagner, 1st year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: Did not play varsity baseball 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Ted Park, a junior right-hander, is the probable staff ace. 
Darin Feinstein, a senior shortstop, is the glue of the infield. Neither played 
last season for the junior varsity. David Schonfeld and Byron Schostag, who 
played for the junior varsity, are the other members of the pitching staff. 
Flip Sides, a team captain whom Wagner calls the best player on the team, will 
catch. Sophomore Sean Wilder starts at first base. Freshmen Sam Park and C.J. 
Thomkins will platoon at second, and junior Andrew Schwarz will start at third. 
The outfield consists of sophomore Taylor Williams, senior Mike Janis and 
either Schonfeld or Schostag. Feinstein or Schostag will start at shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "I'm not really worried about the pitching," Williams said. "These 
guys don't throw hard, but they throw strikes." Williams said he believes that 
if the team can play as well as it can, it may finish at .500 or better. "The 
kids don't feel any pressure at all," he said. "If they win five games, I think 
the school will throw them a party." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
COACH: Dan Gilmartin, 2nd year 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 1-7, tied for 5th in league; 4-13 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Of the 14 players on last season's roster, 12 were seniors, 
which leaves some huge holes to fill. Johnny Namm, a senior and returning 
starter, will start at shortstop. T. J. Jackson, a junior, starts at second 
base. His younger brother, Tarryl, a freshman, will play in center field and 
pitch. Steve Moon, a freshman, will catch. Dave Hanish, a senior, will start in 
the outfield and Dave Wisnia will play third base and pitch. Several positions 
are up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Question marks are plentiful. "It's going to be a very young team," 
Gilmartin said. "This may not be our year, but a couple of years down the road, 
we'll be pretty tough."

MISSION RALLIES AND AGAIN UPSTAGES VALLEY IN 8-8 TIE 
</P>

The Mission College baseball team is forced to play its home games at Valley 
College because it doesn't have a home field. 
</P>
<P>
"We work together and try to schedule things to accommodate each other," Valley 
Coach Chris Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, however, forgot about a Mission home game against Antelope Valley last 
month and wound up canceling practice. The disbelieving Valley players were 
left to watch the Mission game from the bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Monarch players were similarly incredulous Wednesday after watching 
their 7-0 lead turn into an 8-7 deficit in a nonconference game against Mission 
at Valley. But Valley rallied in the bottom of the ninth to forge an 8-8 tie 
before the game was stopped because of darkness at the end of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Valley (4-9-2) erupted for seven runs in the first two innings against Mission 
starter Nino Romo. The Monarchs sent nine batters to the plate in a five-run 
first inning. Designated-hitter E. J. Pape hit a two-run home run in the second 
inning to give Valley a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I was having trouble," Romo said, "My pitches were up early in the game and 
(Valley) kept on hitting them. I just had to relax and do a good job." 
</P>
<P>
He did. Romo stayed in the game and pitched 4 1/3 scoreless innings while his 
Mission teammates added four runs in the third, two in the fifth and one each 
in the sixth and seventh, to take an 8-7 lead before giving way to reliever 
Jose Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to give (Romo) credit," Johnson said. "Not a lot of guys can hang 
in there after giving up seven runs." 
</P>
<P>
Mission (8-5-1), however, was not able to hang on to its one-run lead in the 
bottom of the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Aguilar was hit by a pitch to start Valley's ninth and Mike Osment, running 
for Aguilar, scored on back-to-back singles by Steve Ross and John Stephens 
(three for three). 
</P>
<P>
Ross and Stephens advanced to second and third with nobody out, but Nick 
Lymberpoulos, the fourth Mission pitcher of the game, came in to retire the 
next three batters, two on strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Chavez and Jesse Romero went two for four for Mission. Chavez belted two 
doubles and knocked in three runs and Romero had a single and a double.

HUNTER TOPS WRESTLING CONTENDERS

<P>
Westlake High's Billy Hunter is the favorite in the 175-pound division in the 
state championships today and Saturday at University of the Pacific in 
Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, who won the Southern Section 4-A Division title last Saturday and is 
37-0 with 30 pins, finished second at 175 pounds in last year's state meet. 
</P>
<P>
He lost, 1-0, to Katella's Joe Pastorello. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter is one of five Valley-area Southern Section wrestlers who will make the 
trip. Westlake's Farzin Daneshnia (112) and Neal Mason (154), Agoura's Steve 
Baer (105), and Newbury Park's Jeff Jay (heavyweight) each finished third in 
the 4-A meet and will make their first appearances in the state meet. 
</P>
<P>
Four wrestlers from El Camino Real qualified for the state meet by winning 
their respective weight classes in the City Section finals: David Aparicio 
(112), Greg McMurray (119), Rob Steinbock (145), and Saul Emard (165). 
</P>
<P>
Canoga Park's Mario Acosta (98), Steve Pratt (126) and Chris Camarena (132) 
qualified, as did San Fernando's Greg Tan (154), Granada Hills' Karl Finley 
(175), Birmingham's Barak Isaacs (191) and Chatsworth's Lester Martinez 
(heavyweight). JEFF RILEY

POWAY'S SANER RESIGNS AFTER FOUR SECTION TITLES IN SEVEN YEARS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Neville Saner, who four San Diego Section titles in seven years, resigned 
Thursday as boys' basketball coach at Poway High School. 
</P>
<P>
Saner cited two reasons -- one personal and one professional -- to Principal 
Fred Van Leuven and John Self, Poway's athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to spend more time with my family, and I want to pursue my education 
further," he said in a letter to the administrators. 
</P>
<P>
Saner compiled a 139-42 record (.768) while at Poway. In 1984, he took a team 
that started one junior, three sophomores and a freshman to the section 3-A 
title. 
</P>
<P>
That team, which boasted NCAA Division I players John Colborne (Southern 
Methodist) and Jud Buechler (Arizona), went on to win section titles in 1985 
and '86 as well. 
</P>
<P>
Poway failed to make the playoffs in 1987, but rebounded with a 19-9 season in 
1988 and a fourth section title in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
This year's team (18-7) was eliminated in the Division I quarterfinals by Mt. 
Carmel last week. It had two of the three victories by San Diego County teams 
over second-seeded Mt. Carmel. 
</P>
<P>
Saner did not rule out a return to coaching, possibly at the collegiate level. 
That is one consideration for getting his masters degree, in either physical 
education or geography. 
</P>
<P>
"The masters is something I would like to get whether I get into a college 
coaching situation or not," he said. "But for the time being, I'll be able to 
give my family more time, and that's more important than basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Saner and his wife of 13 years, Diane, have have an 8-year-old daughter, 
Heather. 
</P>
<P>
He said he first considered leaving the program in December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a rigorous seven years; I've worked hard at it and been very 
conscientious," Saner said. "It takes its toll a little bit. 
</P>
<P>
"I need a change. (But) it's very difficult, too. I'm leaving something I've 
been doing quite a while. When you make a change, it's always difficult, 
particularly when it's something you've done particularly well at. 
</P>
<P>
"Poway High has been very good to me, and I've reciprocated, I believe, and I 
leave on very good terms." 
</P>
<P>
Also important to him is that he doesn't leave the cupboard bare. This year's 
team had only two seniors. 
</P>
<P>
Saner coached 13 years before taking over for Poway's Doug Wealch. He coached 
at St. Francis High in La Canada, Alemany High in the San Fernando Valley, 
assisted at Mater Dei in Orange County and coached at Salesian High in East Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
He played basketball for John Wooden at UCLA for three years (1966-69), where 
he backed up Lew Alcindor. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to winning the 1984 section title, Saner said the 1989 championship 
was important because it had no ties to the program that existed before he 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
The other highlight, he said, was this year when his team rallied from a 
15-point deficit with 5:40 left to defeat Mt. Carmel, 80-78.

When Holtville and Coronado meet at noon for the girls' Division IV 
championship, they will be much different teams than those that met in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
In the second game of the season in the Coronado Tournament, Coronado (14-10) 
held as much as a 10-point lead before losing by five. 
</P>
<P>
"I start three different kids than I did then, and he starts two," Coronado 
Coach Ernie Dickerson said. "Looking back on that game, it doesn't mean a whole 
lot." 
</P>
<P>
The teams played for the Division IV championship in each of the past two 
years, with Holtville (17-9) winning both. 
</P>
<P>
Holtville Coach Mike Pacheco said the change to Golden Hall from the Sports 
Arena -- where his team has played in section finals the past four years -- 
could be a "key factor" for Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
"His kids are so young that if we were playing in the Sports Arena, it could 
make a difference," Pacheco said. "Nobody's been at Golden Hall, so there's no 
home-court advantage." 
</P>
<P>
The two only varsity returners for Coronado are Mary Strasser and Kelly Kaye. 
Strasser, a left-handed shooter who started as a freshman last year, has a 
15.5-point average but has averaged 18 the past six games. 
</P>
<P>
Holtville is led by Teresa Ibarra, a 5-1 senior point guard who is averaging 12 
points a game. LAURA PALMER

LINCOLN PROVES ITS POINT

Lincoln coaches and players didn't think there was any controversy to it. Nope, 
it was cut and dried: They were the No. 1 boys' basketball team in Division 
III. 
</P>
<P>
Only thing was, no one agreed. They were billed second to top-seeded USDHS in 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
During the preliminary games, they let that gnaw at them. Coach Ron Loneski 
used it for motivation, and when it came time to decide who really was No. 1 
Thursday night at Golden Hall, Lincoln soundly embarrassed USDHS in the section 
final, 83-66. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, they were favored," Loneski said. "Everyone was saying they were better 
than we are, and you just don't say that to our kids. They're sick and tired of 
hearing it." 
</P>
<P>
But they had to listen, because early in the season, USDHS beat Lincoln, 71-67. 
Yes, the Dons were better. They had proved it. 
</P>
<P>
And then they disproved it. In the first quarter, Lincoln controlled the boards 
at both ends in taking a 16-8 lead. 
</P>
<P>
And then it got ugly. Lincoln opened the second quarter with an 11-2 run, 
during which guard John McCartney scored six points and assisted on two 
baskets. 
</P>
<P>
Just two minutes into the second, it was 27-10. 
</P>
<P>
Almost as quickly, USDHS put together a string of its own to pull within nine. 
But it was a quarter of streaks. After the Dons made it 27-18, Lincoln scored 
13 consecutive points. 
</P>
<P>
Ouch. 40-18. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the earlier game was some sort of aberration. 
</P>
<P>
Not really, said USDHS Coach Jim Tomey. 
</P>
<P>
"The differences were we didn't attack (Thursday) the way we did then," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But there was more to it than that, Lincoln players were saying. 
</P>
<P>
"That was our low point of the season," said senior guard Ken Garner of the 
first game with USDHS. "No one was pressuring out there, and everyone was 
playing as an individual. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we're a family, and when we play as a team, we're going to win." 
</P>
<P>
But if there was one player among the Hornets who did put on an individual 
show, it was Garner himself. 
</P>
<P>
A 13.6-points-per-game scorer during the regular season, Garner nearly doubled 
that average Thursday with 26. What's more, he pulled down 14 rebounds, eight 
on offense. 
</P>
<P>
He credited the numbers to a coaching decision. Last week, Loneski told him to 
start going underneath and grabbing rebounds. Before that, he was strictly an 
outside shooter. 
</P>
<P>
Now about that No. 1 seeding. Tomey insists that Loneski, too, thought USDHS 
deserved it. 
</P>
<P>
"He called me up before the pairings meeting and asked me who I thought should 
be No. 1," Tomey said. "I told him I thought we should be, and he agreed. Then 
he comes into the (seeding) meeting and complains about how he should be the 
No. 1 seed. 
</P>
<P>
"He just did that as a motivational thing." 
</P>
<P>
It worked.

Yvonne Sanchez, the first-year girls' basketball coach at Our Lady of Peace, 
redeemed herself Thursday with her team's 67-60 victory over top-seeded Lincoln 
in the San Diego Section Division III girls' basketball final at Golden Hall. 
</P>
<P>
After the last game of the regular season, Sanchez had said that coaching 
errors -- especially a decision to design OLP's defense around Lincoln's 
6-foot-3 Sheila Dixon -- had contributed to a 12-point loss. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, Sanchez went back to the defense OLP had been using all along. And it 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
"We put 5-8 (April) Velk on (Dixon)," Sanchez said. "She couldn't stop Sheila, 
nobody can. But she did hold her." 
</P>
<P>
Dixon did manage to score 29 points for Lincoln, but it wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
With 2 minutes 58 seconds remaining, Tammy Tavares hit a three-pointer to 
increase OLP's lead to nine. But Dixon scored three consecutive baskets in 50 
seconds to pull Lincoln within three, 62-59. 
</P>
<P>
Free throws decided it after that. Tavares made two with 1:02 remaining. 
Lincoln's Dianna Lewis went to the line and hit one, making it 64-60. With 10 
seconds remaining, Tavares was fouled intentionally and made one to make it 
65-60. And Kathy Bashi went to the line for two more with five seconds 
remaining to finish the scoring and cap the victory for OLP (23-4). 
</P>
<P>
"When you say Lincoln, you think of big people who know how to play 
basketball," Bashi said. "We were definitely the underdog. There are four 
seniors on the team, and we said we were going to win it this year." 
</P>
<P>
Bashi finished with 15 points, Tavares with 21, including two three pointers. 
Velk scored 16. 
</P>
<P>
"We went out there, and we didn't think about past wins or past losses," 
Tavares said. "Everything is different in the playoffs. This has been my goal 
since eighth grade. The last time against Lincoln, we played them so scrappy 
that tonight they didn't know what to do with us. They had three girls on me, 
but I could always twist and turn and get away." 
</P>
<P>
OLP jumped to its biggest lead, 28-16, with three minutes remaining in the 
second quarter. But Lewis scored eight points in the final 3:23 of the half to 
cut the lead to 35-30. Lewis finished with 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
"I was getting a bit nervous," Sanchez said. "I didn't want the girls to get 
tense." 
</P>
<P>
Dixon came out in the third quarter and scored consecutive baskets to bring 
Lincoln within 35-34. The Pilots pushed the advantage back to five, but Lincoln 
again pulled within one on a Dixon basket, 44-43. OLP pulled out to a 
five-point lead one more time, and Bashi then scored on a three-pointer at the 
buzzer to make it 51-43 going into the final quarter.

<P>
Question: Is there much difference in the amount of calories and fat to be 
found in different kinds of fish? My family enjoys red snapper and swordfish, 
for example, and I could prepare either one. 
</P>
<P>
Would the calories and fat make any difference? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: A 3-ounce broiled serving of red snapper provides 104 calories and 1.2 
grams of fat. A similar portion of swordfish provides 128 calories and 4.3 
grams of fat.

<TEXT>
<P>
I want to thank The Times for its article on former Atty. Gen. Ramsey Clark. 
</P>
<P>
These days especially, it's rare to find someone with his integrity and 
willingness to buck the tide and take on unpopular causes, forgoing the money 
to follow his conscience. 
</P>
<P>
In pursuing human rights for all people instead of leaving "blind spots" 
(Palestinians, for example), Clark delivers a message to progressives 
everywhere: Are you in this thing 100% or not? 
</P>
<P>
Agree with him or not, the point is, he truly believes in those ideals we were 
taught America is supposed to uphold.

It's too bad Benedict Arnold isn't alive so you could do a real puff piece on a 
traitor. Actually, however, old Benedict didn't stoop to the degraded level of 
your hero, Ramsey Clark, to whom View devoted a Page 1, four-color love letter. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the publicity given to Jane Fonda's embrace of the Communist Viet Cong 
and her taunting of sick, wounded and starving U.S. prisoners of the North 
Vietnamese Reds, the American POWs ignored her as a brainless Hollywood 
airhead, Barbarella over the hill. 
</P>
<P>
But when Ramsey Clark, the former attorney general of the United States, 
belittled the helpless American captives and praised their Communist jailers, 
that broke the spirit of many U.S. POWs, some of whom died. Others, who 
survived, have forgiven their Viet jailers but still regard Ramsey Clark as a 
son of Satan.

TAKING UMBRAGE WITH 'GOOD MANNERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I would like to compliment staff writer Nikki Finke on her witty article 
regarding good manners in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
I have a suggestion I believe covers the field most succinctly, and it has to 
do with -- of all things -- golf. 
</P>
<P>
As presently codified, the rules and etiquette of golf are far more complicated 
than any book on manners ever written; however, I would refer you to the 
ancient rules of golf. 
</P>
<P>
Play the course as you find it. Play the ball as it lies. Do what's fair. 
</P>
<P>
It seems to me that those rules cover most any social situation I have come 
across in a long life.

CONNERY IN COMMAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's an amiable smartness to the underwater thriller "The Hunt for Red 
October" (citywide). Its film makers know that a little technology goes a very 
long way, and if they hope to keep an audience's attention they'll have to do 
it with story, not hardware. 
</P>
<P>
Writers Larry Ferguson and Donald Stewart, a first-rate cast and director John 
McTiernan, whose signature is sleek action ("Die Hard"), have managed this 
nicely. You may not be limp from accumulated tension when this hunt is over, 
but its cautiously upbeat global message leaves a satisfying glow and it 
operates with a crackerjack premise. 
</P>
<P>
To stay current, the pre-glasnost time-frame of Tom Clancy's bulky Cold War 
chiller has been underlined and the film makers have added a puckish opening 
disclaimer: Both the U.S. and Soviet governments deny that any of what follows 
ever took place. They've also tamed the novel's hyper-technicalities so that 
even those of us who have trouble with the working parts of a fly swatter don't 
feel overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that the Russian leader of the pack, Marko Alexandrovich Ramius (Sean 
Connery, in a bristling gray brush-cut and beard), has run amok, while 
captaining the first run of the Soviets' most super-secret nuclear submarine. 
After taking the ominous black behemoth Red October out of its Murmansk port, 
equipped with something that makes it run very silent indeed, he and his 
100-man crew have seemingly vanished to where no sonar can track them. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of both countries are taut as banjo strings. If you believe U.S. 
National Security types like Richard Jordan, Connery is going to park his 
monster sub somewhere off Manhattan and start lobbing nuclear missiles right 
past Donald Trump's ear at strategic U.S. population centers. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet high command believes differently. Connery has been depressed since 
the death of his wife, lost in an unfortunately stillborn subplot exactly one 
year to the day before he left port. He's also not Russian but Lithuanian, and 
ethnic rumblings have been on the increase in the Soviet Union. The Kremlin 
suspects he's in the process of defecting, taking his unique warship with him. 
</P>
<P>
So does one dogged low-level CIA analyst, Jack Ryan (Alec Baldwin), who has 
followed Connery's brilliant naval maneuvers for years. The race will be to see 
if Baldwin and his superior, Adm. Greer (James Earl Jones), can persuade the 
Joint Chiefs that Baldwin's theory is not one of a raving lunatic. And having 
done that, he will have to persuade the highly skeptical skipper (Scott Glenn) 
of the American sub Dallas tracking Connery that -- should they ever locate Red 
October -- firing when ready is not in the interest of the peace of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Only the officers of Red October are in on their captain's plans, and not all 
of them. So Connery must fool his own enormous crew, a swift, pursuing Soviet 
sub and the Dallas, equipped with both super-sonar and Baldwin, second-guessing 
Connery's every move. 
</P>
<P>
It is rather a lot to swallow, which is why one casts Connery, whose presence 
can persuade audiences that preposterous action is as real as potatoes. Works 
every time. Without even a fleshed-out story of his wife's death for 
motivation, looking Russian and speaking in his splendid Scots burr, Connery 
can still lead us anywhere and we go uncomplainingly. 
</P>
<P>
Stripped-down characterizations like these need actors whose personalities 
carry their own wattage. Director McTiernan cast this way before in "Die Hard," 
with Alan Rickman's villain and Bonnie Bedelia's estranged wife. 
</P>
<P>
Here he has Scott Glenn's captain, something of an enigma politically; Sam 
Neill as Connery's second-in-command, a Russian with a hankering for an RV in 
Montana when all this is behind them -- oh, please! -- and the splendidly 
ironic Joss Ackland as the Soviet ambassador in Washington who must watch that 
he does not step into his own traps. 
</P>
<P>
For a definition of maximum effectiveness in a limited role, watch Courtney B. 
Vance's sonar operator, who must persuade everyone of what he alone has heard 
-- fleetingly. And as Connery's underwater connection, a man whose peaceable 
intentions are a match for Connery's, Baldwin's amiable Ryan seems to thrive 
under pressure, maturing as the action progresses. 
</P>
<P>
The production is as clean and effective as Red October herself; there's not 
one dial or glowing radar screen too many; the underwater hits and near-misses 
are clearly choreographed and the undersea intensity is captured perfectly by 
Jan De Bont's camera work.

A New Really Good Shew?: NBC and talk-show king Larry King are talking about 
doing a pilot for a prime-time series. 
</P>
<P>
According to King, he would host the live program weekly from the stage of a 
New York theater, featuring "newsmakers in the audience and new acts." But NBC 
officials denied suggestions that the project would be an Ed Sullivan-type 
variety show, describing it instead as an informational program. There is no 
deal yet; King said that the discussions started when NBC Entertainment 
President Brandon Tartikoff appeared on King's radio show. BETH KLEID

In the long-running battle among dance-music divas Paula Abdul and Janet 
Jackson for pop-chart supremacy, Abdul continues to reign on the Billboard 
magazine pop album chart. But in the next week or two, Jackson could unseat 
Abdul. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's "Escapade" single, currently No. 1 on the pop singles' chart, is 
hotter than Abdul's "Opposites Attract" single, which is No. 6 and sliding down 
the chart. Also, Jackson is getting a lot of publicity because of her first 
tour. Buoyed by her Grammy haul, Bonnie Raitt's "Nick of Time" album vaulted 
from No. 40 to No. 22. 
</P>
<P>
* The Polish female vocalist Basia, who sings both soul and Latin-flavored 
songs, is no flash-in-the-pan. "London Warsaw New York," the follow-up to her

Send Resumes: Curator Franklin Kelly is leaving the Corcoran Gallery of Art in 
Washington, which has been the target of criticism over cancellation of a 
controversial photography exhibition last year, to return to the National 
Gallery of Art as research curator of American art. Kelly complained of 
increasingly heavy administrative duties at the Corcoran. The Corcoran is still 
searching for a successor to former director Christina Orr-Cahall, who resigned 
last year, and has two other top-level openings. BETH KLEID

On Your Way Out: The major TV networks agreed Wednesday to jointly conduct exit 
polls and project winners on Election Day to save money and lessen the 
competitive pressure to call a race before the polls close in the West. CNN, 
which has not conducted exit polls before, joined ABC, CBS and NBC in the 
consortium, to be known as Voter Research and Surveys. The organization will 
survey a random sampling of voters as they leave polling places each Election 
Day, providing its findings on local, state and national races to the networks 
and other media. BETH KLEID

SWEDISH GUITARIST SOLLSCHER MAKES WEST COAST DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When guitarist Goran Sollscher made his West Coast debut Wednesday night at 
Ambassador Auditorium, it was hard to determine if his brief but carefully 
selected program may have been too distant and cerebral. 
</P>
<P>
The steady, bespectacled Swede commands a cool approach to his craft that 
stresses a seldom faltering accuracy and a certain understated quality that 
nakedly allows each composition to stand on its own. 
</P>
<P>
But although he ostensibly relishes each morsel of music he makes, it is a 
private enjoyment that doesn't always reach the listener with the same degree 
of warmth. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the clarity and lucidity of his phrasing and interpretation blend 
with striking intelligence. What is missing in tenderness is supplanted by a 
sturdy architecture that never succumbs to bombast or needless ornamentation. 
</P>
<P>
His impressive use of an 11-string guitar added a provocative touch to his own 
transcription of Bach's Sonata No. 3 for solo violin. Resisting some of the 
showy devices of more reknowned guitarists -- such as vibrato or flashy use of 
extended techniques -- Sollscher painstakingly placed every note, giving the 
music well-focused integrity. 
</P>
<P>
On the common six-string instrument, a conservative, neoclassic work by Swedish 
composer Dag Wiren -- "Liten serenade" (1964) -- offered a pleasant 
alternative, but makes few demands on the player or listener. The music dances 
modestly in an innocuous tonal language without substantially communicating or 
exploring. 
</P>
<P>
Granados' "Danza espanola" No. 5 tested a more invigorating side to Sollscher's 
playing that succeeded on a virtuosic level, but stylistically needed a more 
genuine Spanish flavor. Falla's "Homenaje a Claude Debussy" provided a softer, 
less active study that also proved more routine than idiomatic. Ponce's more 
ambitious "Sonatina meridional" similarly proceeded adequately and seamlessly. 
The scanty but appreciative audience summoned two encores. GREGG WAGER

PACIFIC SERENADES PREMIERES WORK BY KIBBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY McQUILKIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The programming practices of Pacific Serenades, now in its fourth season, ought 
to provide a model for any chamber music series. First, the concerts are held 
in intimate, hospitable surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
Second, as was the case Wednesday evening at the William Andrews Clark Library, 
each concert places a newly commissioned work alongside examples of the 
standard chamber music repertory. 
</P>
<P>
And that's where contemporary music belongs, anyway -- not relegated to 
mind-numbing orgies of new music. Michael Kibbe's "Winter Moods," for flute, 
violin, cello and harpsichord, fit right in with the Baroque works flanking it, 
yet proved a highly original, distinctive statement. 
</P>
<P>
That the 44-year-old composer's score should fare so well in the august company 
of works by Bach, Handel and Vivaldi is testament to his skill. "Winter Moods" 
exhibits vigorous, engaging rhythms, masterfully executed transitions within 
movements (all too rare these days) and a keen sense of pacing. 
</P>
<P>
Flutist Mark Carlson (the artistic director of the series), violinist Roger 
Wilkie, cellist David Speltz and harpsichordist Owen Burdick delivered the 
premiere with superior control, sensitivity and drive. 
</P>
<P>
The various players brought elegance and poetry to Bach's Gamba Sonata in G, 
and offered a confident, somewhat edgy sounding account of a Sonata in D by 
Vivaldi. Two Trio Sonatas from Handel's Opus 2 illustrated the ensemble's 
tautness and capacity for expression. TERRY McQUILKIN

WAVERLY CONSORT OFFERS TOUR OF ITALIAN WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The idea was simple enough: Present in a single concert a musical tour of 
Renaissance Italy that encapsulates two centuries of achievement. That's what 
the Waverly Consort apparently had in mind Wednesday night at the Bing Theater 
of the County Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
But 46 pieces and more than two hours later, one was left with impressions of a 
musical diversity well beyond the scope of concise definition. It was a long 
way, both temporally and stylistically, from where the concert began, with 
Dufay's cerebral "Motet for the Consecration of Santa Maria del Fiore" of 1436, 
to where it ended, with Banchieri's "The Animals Improvise Counterpoint" (circa 
1600), with its silly bow-wows, meows and cuckoos. Even the hour-long 
preconcert lecture and the lavishly illustrated 36-page program booklet could 
do little in the way of cohesive summary. 
</P>
<P>
Highlights included that Dufay motet -- its musical architecture a mathematical 
mirror of Brunelleschi's dome -- in a simple and elegant performance by six 
voices accompanied with handbells. There was Isaac's somber 1492 "Lament on the 
death of Lorenzo de' Medici," with the tenors dropping out in the third verse 
representing the absence of Lorenzo, a tenor himself. There were madrigals 
early and late, from the simple beginnings by Festa and Verdelot to the complex 
heights of chromaticism, tone painting and virtuosic display of Marenzio, Wert 
and Monteverdi. These were in conspicuous contrast to the broad humor and bawdy 
vulgarities of the street music of Venice and Naples that followed. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the sold-out performance, the Waverly Consort brought unassuming 
expertise and expressive ease to all of the music. Though performing in 
historically accurate style from scholarly editions on authentic reproductions 
of period instruments, the results were anything but stuffy or pedantic. And 
even if one couldn't entirely grasp the stunning variety of it all, one could 
certainly enjoy the ride. TIMOTHY MANGAN

IRREVERENT HARDING STANDS OUT ON CLEAN-CUT TRIPLE BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The three acts on stage Wednesday at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano 
looked clean-cut and scrubbed enough to get day jobs at Disneyland. The Mighty 
Lemon Drops and the Ocean Blue were self-effacing bands that would have no 
trouble getting hired, but their Sire Records label-mate John Wesley Harding 
would probably flunk his job interview by making some cheeky remark. 
</P>
<P>
Although playing solo, the British newcomer was the only act on the bill to 
show much edge or personality, salting his half-hour set with lots of 
irreverent pop star name-dropping and singing a heavy-handed but effective 
spoof about Live Aid. Harding did best, though, when he wasn't trying so hard 
to be witty. The set's highlight was "Spaced Cowgirl," a ballad with a complex 
blend of compassion and condescension toward a woman who's losing her grip. 
</P>
<P>
Like a lot of newcomers, Harding has yet to commit the necessary assassination 
of his influences. In his vocal style and tone, and in his songs' quick torrent 
of imagery and wordplay, he was a virtual mirror of Elvis Costello. Harding 
styles himself as "the groom" in a wry song about his arrival on the rock 
scene, but until he finds his own distinctive voice, he's asking Costello fans 
to become musical bigamists. 
</P>
<P>
The Mighty Lemon Drops also seemed fixed at times on a better-known precursor: 
the Doors. While the British band threw out catchy pop hooks and managed a 
strong rhythmic surge when it wasn't playing turgid ballads, the show quickly 
fell into sameness. 
</P>
<P>
The Drops' songs about romantic contretemps didn't catch hold emotionally, and 
the band, which has been around since 1986, has yet to develop a performing 
personality. Hence the need for smoke, strobe lighting and -- in a club! -- a 
green laser beam during a rushed encore rendition of the Rolling Stones' "Paint 
It, Black." 
</P>

The Ocean Blue, from Hershey, Pa., offered a pillowy weave of synthesizer and 
rippling guitar that proved to be an inviting backdrop for reverie, with a 
sturdy rhythmic spine and a knack for the occasional melodic hook helping to 
sustain interest during long, dreamy passages.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING AT NOA NOA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

"See this," says Kenji Seki, bouncing around with the impish energy that 
endeared him to people when he was maitre d' at Chinois on Main. "Everything 
custom made." 
</P>
<P>
"Everything" includes the gorgeous wrought iron chairs, the colorful rug, the 
Polynesian sconces on the wall and the crumpled copper front on the bar. It 
also includes what may be the best looking restrooms in town -- also 
custom-made. Put it all together and you've got Noa Noa, 464 N. Bedford Drive, 
Beverly Hills, (213) 278-1904, the most extraordinary new restaurant in town. 
</P>
<P>
The food by chef Ralf Marhencke is custom-made too. And unusual. The green 
salad has Roquefort croutons, lots of flowers and a kiwi vinaigrette. Warm 
oysters come in a sesame seed crust. Roasted scallops are bathed in a spicy 
Thai sauce and roasted breast of chicken shares the plate with purple mashed 
potatoes. Desserts include chocolate dim sum filled with banana mousse (don't 
ask) and something called "hot passion," which is every bit as good as its 
name. Entrees run $16.75 to $24. There's a long list of single-malt Scotches, 
and an interesting wine list. RUTH REICHL

AN ADVENTURE TAKES ROOT IN PASADENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it comes right down to it, what has Santa Monica got that Pasadena hasn't? 
Pasadena's got museums, professional-class people, no-growth and all that. 
Sure, it doesn't have a beach, but it actually has some history, and that's got 
to count for something. 
</P>
<P>
Evidently where it lags is in the restaurant department. Only slowly has 
Pasadena been crawling out of the era when its most famous dining places were 
cafeterias. The problem has been a certain deficit in the spirit of adventure. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Oaks on the Plaza, the restaurant at the new Doubletree Hotel, is 
coming to the rescue. It's grand and soothing and spacious (let's see Santa 
Monica top it for spaciousness, in fact), with big flower arrangements, an 
immense display kitchen and a ceiling filled with billows of fabric. It's 
remarkably reasonable. And adventuresome? You can practically hear the kitchen 
spraining its imagination to come up with this so-called "Aggressive 
California" menu that combines French, Italian, Basque, Cajun, Japanese and 
Mexican. 
</P>
<P>
The result has splendor about it, but some of the adventures go awry. For 
instance, there's a sort of yaki soba corner on the menu, and while the 
buckwheat noodles and their chicken, shrimp or vegetable accompaniments are 
delicious, the noodles have a slight orange flavor. This is a charming idea at 
first, but it gets a little old by the time you're down to the last noodle. 
</P>
<P>
The Basque three-bean soup is a richly flavored combination of beans and 
lentils with thick lamb stock. However, on one occasion the soup of the day, 
said to be gumbo, turned out to be more like the Cantonese dish juk, a thin 
rice porridge with bits of sweet pepper and pork sausage in it. And chicken 
with sage jus is hard to characterize exactly: cuisine minceur, spa food, 
hospital food? It's chicken breast with nothing but light sage-flavored broth 
for a sauce. 
</P>
<P>
But let's talk about the splendid adventures for a while. There's a substantial 
appetizer of lamb medallions with walnuts and balsamic vinegar that could have 
come from medieval Baghdad. Another impressive combination of aristocratic 
flavors is veal in a dry sherry sauce with walnuts and lemon peel. Lamb with 
pinot noir and figs sounds bizarre, but the sauce is really a thick, dark 
reduction of wine and meat juices with just an exotic hint of fig. 
</P>
<P>
Fish in a potato jacket usually means fish fried between layers of julienned 
potato, like the Swiss dish rosti with fish in the middle. At the Oaks, the 
effect is fish sauteed with potatoes, but it is certainly luscious with its 
delicate whiskey-flavored butter sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The best dessert seems to be espresso pot-au-creme, like an espresso-flavored 
creme caramel with a tiny Stonehenge of almond slivers on it and a little pot 
of thick, hot chocolate sauce on the side. By comparison, the Basque cake is 
excessively homey, a plain cake with slices of apple mixed in the dough. There 
are also a goat cheese cheesecake and a sort of miniature baked Alaska filled 
with . . . peppermint ice cream. At the same time it manages to be a 
7-year-old's nightmare and a 7-year-old's dream. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena can hold its head up. The Oaks is as splendid and cockeyed as anything 
Santa Monica has to offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oaks on the Plaza, Doubletree Hotel, 191 N. Los Robles Ave., Pasadena. 
(818) 792-2727. Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner daily. Full bar (with 
tapas). Validated parking in lot on Union Street. All major credit cards 
accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $40-$57.

MOVABLE FEASTS: HOME COOKING, ITALIAN STYLE, AT VITTORIO! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By L.N. HALLIBURTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is no accident, I think, that there's an exclamation point fixed to the end 
of this Italian restaurant's name. Vittorio! is a place where garlic!, olive 
oil! and Southern Italian home cooking! reign. Both the taste of the food and 
the tone of the place have the spirit of a Sunday-night supper on New York's 
Mulberry Street. (OK, so this Palisades veteran has spiffed-up its looks; so 
have countless restaurants in Little Italy.) 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing quiet or restrained about this cuisine. It is as buxom as a 
va-va-va-voom Cinecitta queen. If you like your antipasto crazy with olive oil, 
your squid salad covered with a hailstorm of garlic and your cannoli the 
spitting image of one you'd pick up at a San Gennaro Feast, then add Vittorio! 
to your take-out list. 
</P>
<P>
There's one thing I should warn you about: Vittorio! is very generous with 
their snail-shaped, garlic- and oil-soaked pizza dough rolls -- and they are 
hard to resist. I have watched normally sane human beings act like pigs at 
truffle time when the rolls, the antipasto (fat red and yellow peppers, 
marinated broccoli, good feta and good olives for $7) and the insanely 
delicious calamari salad (as pink and as tender and as garlic-oily as it comes, 
$5.50) are brought forth. 
</P>
<P>
The stuffed mushrooms (seven for $5.50) are especially nice -- hot, meaty and 
heaped with bread, garlic and parsley. Though essentially the same stuffing is 
piled into large artichokes (dig deep enough and you'll find mozzarella 
shards), with less surface to brown the filling tastes wet and soggy, like some 
lost Thanksgiving ($5.50). 
</P>
<P>
Mussels marinara ($9.50) are another delightful appetizer: sweet tasting 
mussels blanketed with a thin, light, garlic-strewn, clearly homemade tomato 
sauce. At the same price, calamari fritti is equally plentiful but so 
greased-up it tastes like carnival food. 
</P>
<P>
There are nearly 20 pasta selections (when you call, ask for the specials of 
the day). No goat cheese, no sun-dried tomatoes, you know the turf: linguine 
with two kinds of clam sauce, spaghetti and meatballs, linguine and garlic 
shrimp. . . . Something listed simply as "baked pasta" ($8.50) turns out to be 
a meaty, mozzarella-laden manicotti, as New York Italian-homey as I've had in 
L.A. 
</P>
<P>
The linguine with white clam sauce ($11.50) is straightforward and delicious, 
filled with lots of oil, lots of garlic and lots of pale pink fresh clam 
chunks. Six large tender shrimp mixed with oil, garlic, parsley and a heap of 
linguine ($12.50) are a pleasant enough way to eat protein and complex carbs 
but lacked oomph. 
</P>
<P>
Veal and peppers ($11.50 and served with pasta) are lovingly prepared lean, 
lemony slices of veal mixed with two handfuls of velvety and yellow peppers. 
Crisp, fresh and certainly tasty enough again, New York-style pizza with its 
fat, chewy dough comes in every standard guise. I tried the primavera with ripe 
tomatoes, fresh basil and garlic, and the meatball pizza with its meatballs 
sliced like meat loaf and a simple, well-balanced sauce, yet they're nothing to 
write home to Mama (or KCRW's Billy Vera) about. 
</P>
<P>
Those somewhat greasy homemade cannoli ($2.50), packed with vanilla and dotted 
with chocolate bits, deserve an exclamation mark. But what particularly 
punctuates my memory is Vittorio!'s calamari salad. I want a lifetime 
subscription to that squid. 
</P>
<P>
Vittorio!, 16646 Marquez Ave., Pacific Palisades. (213) 459-3755, 459-9316. 
Open Tuesday through Sunday, 4 p.m. to 11 p.m. Neighborhood delivery available. 
No checks or credit cards accepted.

HOME TECH / WHAT'S NEW: BASEBALL VIDEOS HERE -- EVEN IF SEASON ISN'T; 
</P>
<P>
THIS WEEK'S MOVIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY ATKINSON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There may not be baseball this spring -- thanks to the ongoing dispute between 
owners and players -- but there will be baseball videos to watch. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pride of St. Louis" and "The Babe Ruth Story" (both from CBS/Fox, $19.98 
each) aren't exactly up to "Bull Durham" in quality, but at least these two 
filmographies from 40 years ago will fill in a few hours with the sound of 
balls hitting bats and fists hitting gloves to comfort TV-game-less addicts. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pride of St. Louis" is the better of the two. The 1952 film tells the 
story of one of the game's most colorful characters, pitcher (and later NBC 
announcer) Dizzy Dean. Dan Dailey plays Diz in a movie that doesn't quite 
convince but does entertain. 
</P>
<P>
Even less believable is "The Babe Ruth Story," a flat, whitewashed 1948 
biography of the man who's generally considered the best in the game's history. 
William Bendix is suitably irrepressible as the Babe, but otherwise baseball 
fans will be disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
CBS/Fox is also re-releasing "The Pride of the Yankees" (also $19.98), 
previously available from Key Video. A far better film than the other two, this 
1942 drama starred Gary Cooper as Ruth's most notable teammate, the great 
slugger Lou Gehrig. 
</P>
<P>
And coming next week: "Field of Dreams" (March 8). 
</P>
<P>
Old baseball films aren't the only vintage videos CBS/Fox is offering this 
week. Under the banner of "Classic Romances," these four new releases are 
$39.98 each: 
</P>
<P>
"Desk Set" (1957). Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn in a lightweight but 
enjoyable comedy about the introduction of a computer to the research 
department of a business, much to the researchers' dismay. 
</P>
<P>
"Heaven Can Wait" (1943). Not to be confused with the Warren Beatty movie of 
the same name, this Ernst Lubitsch film is an ironic, sophisticated 
comedy/fantasy about a man (Don Ameche) who tells his life story to the devil 
in an attempt to figure out if he's been put in the right place. 
</P>
<P>
"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir" (1947). More sophisticated comedy -- this time from 
Joseph L. Mankiewicz -- about a young widow (Gene Tierney) and the ghost of a 
sea captain (Rex Harrison) who inhabits the house she moves into. 
</P>
<P>
"An Affair to Remember" (1957). Leo McCarey directed this OK but flawed remake 
of his superior 1939 film "Love Affair." Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr help make 
this shipboard comedy palatable. 
</P>
<P>
One other notable oldie, from Warner ($59.95), is "Goodby, My Lady" -- not a 
great film, but a touching and well-made one about a boy (the reliable Brandon 
de Wilde) and his dog. Walter Brennan, Phil Harris and a young Sidney Poitier 
also enliven the sentimental picture. 
</P>
<P>
The newer movies making their way to video this week are considerably less 
interesting, including the silly, unfunny Australian comedy "Young Einstein" 
(Warner, $89.95, PG) and the putrid horror sequel "Halloween 5: The Revenge of 
Michael Myers" (CBS/Fox, $89.98, R). TERRY ATKINSON

YOUNG SALVADORAN FIGHTS INS TO KEEP DREAM ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just after they finished the long trek from El Salvador to the United States 
six years ago, 14-year-old Miguel Perez made one last promise to his dying 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her that I would succeed, that I would become somebody," said Perez, 
now 20. "She gave up her life for me." 
</P>
<P>
After years of hard work and study, Perez has kept his promise. Today, he is a 
standout third-year psychology student at Cal State Dominguez Hills and was 
recently offered a summer research position at Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
But Perez's academic career may be cut short, and his drive to succeed may be 
frustrated if, as scheduled, he is deported March 9 by the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
Since university officials learned of the pending deportation order a week ago, 
they have rallied to support him, writing letters and making phone calls to 
immigration officials and U.S. congressmen. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign to halt the deportation was just the latest episode of a saga that 
started with Perez leaving the port city of La Union in eastern El Salvador and 
finally arriving in South Gate to begin an uncertain life as an undocumented 
immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
Perez and his mother were detained by U.S. Border Patrol agents minutes after 
they illegally crossed the Mexican border on foot near San Ysidro in January, 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
After a few weeks in separate INS detention cells, both were released when they 
applied for political asylum. Soon afterward, Perez's mother died and he became 
an orphan at 14. 
</P>
<P>
Perez's asylum application dragged through immigration court for more than five 
years, until last December when his final appeal before the Board of 
Immigration Appeals was denied. 
</P>
<P>
Immigration attorneys say cases such as Perez's are common among young 
undocumented immigrants in Southern California who have been abandoned by their 
parents or whose parents have died since coming to the United States. Even 
though the young immigrants may have grown into adulthood in this country, they 
face deportation if they have been unable to legalize their status. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Schey, executive director of the Center for Human Rights and 
Constitutional Law, said in the past few years his agency has handled several 
hundred cases of young immigrants who have been returned, alone, to their 
native countries. 
</P>
<P>
"We've received collect calls from children at the airport in San Salvador, 
saying, 'What do I do? I'm here at the airport? Where do I go? I don't have any 
money,' " Schey said. 
</P>
<P>
Immigration officials said youths are turned over to the proper authorities in 
the countries to which they are deported. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't just flip them across the border," said INS spokesman Joe Flanders. 
Once an immigration judge orders a deportation, the INS must carry it out. In 
some cases, Flanders said, immigration officials will provide a small stipend 
to indigent deportees. 
</P>
<P>
In denying Perez political asylum in May, 1988, Immigration Judge Robert 
Griffin said Perez had "failed to establish that his life or freedom would be 
threatened in El Salvador." Perez's attorneys counter that the Santa Ana lawyer 
who originally handled the asylum application simply neglected to present 
evidence to show Perez might be in danger if he returned to his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Because Perez has grown into adulthood in the United States, he worries that he 
may find it difficult to adjust to life in El Salvador if forced to return. He 
speaks both English and Spanish fluently and his friends say he seems to be 
almost as American as he is Salvadoran. 
</P>
<P>
Most immigrants deported from the United States to El Salvador know that, at 
the very least, a familiar culture will be waiting for them. Perez, however, 
doesn't even have any living relatives there. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no one for him to go back to in El Salvador," said Carl M. Shusterman, 
one of his attorneys. "He's completely Americanized." 
</P>
<P>
Perez said of his possible return to El Salvador: "It certainly would be 
reverse cultural shock. I've been accustomed to the way we do things here." 
</P>
<P>
Shusterman and Jay Segal, who is also representing Perez, said they don't blame 
the INS for the scheduled deportation. 
</P>
<P>
Shusterman said after reviewing court documents he believes that the attorney 
who originally handled Perez's asylum application displayed "total 
incompetence." 
</P>
<P>
In one 1988 court appearance, the Santa Ana attorney who represented him 
presented no documentary evidence to support Perez's claim that he had reason 
to fear persecution if he was returned to El Salvador, Shusterman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Miguel's interests were not served. His case showed a total lack of 
preparation," Segal added. "I have never seen this in 30 years of practice." 
</P>
<P>
The attorney was suspended by the State Bar of California in 1988, bar 
officials said. He faces a variety of allegations in State Bar Court, including 
that he misled a Canadian immigrant applying for a "green card," a temporary 
residency card. 
</P>
<P>
Shusterman, a former INS prosecutor, said he would file an appeal next week in 
Perez's case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in San 
Francisco. He also directed Perez to request asylum, as a last resort, from the 
Canadian Consulate in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
At Cal State Dominguez Hills, school officials expressed shock that the popular 
and successful student soon might be forced out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just a tremendous young man," said Catherine Shaffer, a financial aid 
counselor who said she invited Perez to spend last Christmas with her family in 
Ukiah, in Northern California. "This is devastating. Everyone here is writing 
letters and doing what needs to be done to keep him here." 
</P>
<P>
University Vice President Louis Murdock contacted the office of Rep. Mervyn M. 
Dymally (D-Los Angeles) to plead Perez's case. Dymally's office contacted 
Shusterman's law firm, which agreed to take the case. 
</P>
<P>
Perez belongs to several student organizations at the university, including an 
association of minority social-science researchers. He has written articles for 
the newsletter of the Chicano News Media Assn., criticizing U.S. immigration 
authorities for their policies on political asylum cases. He also once served 
as volunteer photo editor for Americas 2001, a Latino-affairs magazine. 
</P>
<P>
And even though he is not an American citizen, on several occasions he has 
written to his congressmen to criticize U.S. support for the Salvadoran 
government. Perez's attorneys say the letters may place his life in danger if 
he must return to El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
"I came to the conclusion that U.S. aid to El Salvador does more harm than 
good," Perez said, explaining why he wrote the letters. "It leaves no 
possibility for change in the country. A few rich people are in power." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers at South Gate High School, which Perez entered in 1984 while living 
with his sister and an elderly aunt, find it remarkable that Perez has 
progressed so far in his studies. When he first came to the school, he "didn't 
know a word of English," said Rena Patton, an instructor in English as a second 
language. 
</P>
<P>
Within a year, Perez had mastered the language, Patton said. Eventually, he 
graduated 12th in a class of more than 500 seniors. 
</P>
<P>
"He's probably the most outstanding student I've ever had in my career as a 
teacher," Patton said. 
</P>
<P>
Perez returns to the high school every semester to talk to Spanish-speaking 
students about the importance of seeking an education, Patton said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the remarkable thing about him. He didn't just take from the school and 
run away. He's wanted to put back into education what he took out. . . . If 
he's forced to go to Canada, it will be their gain and our loss." 
</P>
<P>
If he returns to El Salvador, Perez will for the first time visit the grave of 
his mother, Elena Manzano, who was buried there after she died in Los Angeles 
of heart disease at the age of 61.

YOUR NUMBER WILL SOON BE UP IN GIRL SCOUT COOKIE SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA L. La GANGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sorry, girls, but, in today's world, you've got to have more than just a 
melting smile and a winsome ponytail to sell Thin Mints and Tagalongs and 
Trefoil shortbreads. It takes perseverance, salesmanship, accounting -- and a 
telephone. 
</P>
<P>
For selling is serious business, and Girl Scouts of the USA is bound and 
determined to turn out accomplished sales representatives. The wares are the 
same, but the tools have changed. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in the Los Angeles Basin, the Girl Scout council is teaching 
its oldest green-clad charges to function as sophisticated telemarketers, 
transforming their dens into baked-goods boiler rooms and themselves into 
silken-voiced saleswomen. 
</P>
<P>
Tips, straight from the Girl Scout manual, include: "Save your telephone sales 
cards. They will become valuable references for next year and following years." 
And: "Careful selection of words and your tone of voice must generate the image 
of someone that people trust." 
</P>
<P>
It's too soon to tell how many members of the Angeles Girl Scout Council will 
heed that advice and start selling over the phone, scout officials said. But 
the practice could give the girls, ages 13 to 18, a new tool to replace the one 
they invariably lose as they grow older. 
</P>
<P>
"The older girls have the feeling that people don't want to buy from them," 
said Billy Vanderpool, a board member and cookie sales trainer for the Angeles 
Council. "They're not cute little girls. And, also, it's embarrassing to go out 
in your uniform when you're 16. And this gets the girls more involved in the 
business aspects so they can apply it to their own career future." 
</P>
<P>
Hawking Samoas and Golden Yangels and Do-Si-Dos still supplies most of the 
money that keeps the 78-year-old organization afloat. But growing health and 
safety concerns and changes in the American family have caused the group's 333 
regional councils to turn to increasingly sophisticated marketing techniques in 
addition to the traditional door-to-door sales. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Since the mid-1980s, Girl Scouts have been specially trained for 
confrontations with the nutritionally correct. They are armed with written 
pitches provided by the companies licensed to bake for the group, and they are 
skilled, as these manuals say, at "turning negatives into positives." 
</P>
<P>
A neighbor says cookies are bad for the health? If the scout is on her toes, 
she'll answer: "Our cookies contain no preservatives and no artificial colors 
and are made with 100% vegetable shortening." 
</P>
<P>
And she'll tell that naysayer that Trefoil shortbreads have only 30 calories 
each, that the chocolate chip cookies are rich in fiber, low in fat, sweetened 
with real fruit juice and have 25% less sodium. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The San Gorgonio Girl Scout Council instituted an 800 number in 1989, so 
potential customers could place their orders directly at the group's 
headquarters in Colton. Older Girl Scouts packaged the cookies for delivery by 
United Parcel Service. 
</P>
<P>
The result of this and a few additional modifications? A 28% surge in orders, 
the biggest percentage increase for any council in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"We want everyone who wants Girl Scout cookies to get them," said Vern 
Woodlies, director of fund development for the San Gorgonio group. "With both 
parents working, it's not possible to have all the girls do door-to-door 
sales." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Girl Scout Council of Greater New York has found that it pays to know 
the market. As a result, the group takes cookie orders in February but does not 
deliver the wares until late April or early May. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to take Passover into consideration in the New York market," Kathy 
Gallo, the group's spokeswoman, said. "(Many Jews cannot) have Girl Scout 
cookies in the house, so we wait until the holiday's over. Our delivery date is 
always contingent on when Passover is." 
</P>
<P>
 -- To keep up with rising prices, Girl Scout cookies are getting more 
expensive. Although the sweets can be found for as little as $1.75 in some 
areas, they sell for $2.75 a box in others. Prices are set by the 333 separate 
councils to reflect concerns such as delivery costs in different parts of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 councils in Southern California -- along with groups that serve the 
greater New York, Atlanta, and Columbus, Ga., areas -- raised the cookie price 
this year to $2.50 from $2. For Southern California, it is the first price hike 
in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Girl Scout councils throughout the country began experimenting with 
telemarketing three years ago with mixed results, and the Angeles Council is 
the first in the Southland to push organized telephone sales. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange, San Diego and Imperial counties, girls have been encouraged for the 
last five years to telephone friends and relatives in order to sell cookies. 
But they have yet to reach out and touch strangers. 
</P>
<P>
"The technique of just going around and knocking on doors is seen by parents as 
being potentially dangerous and unproductive," said Cece Sander, director of 
product sales for the Orange County Girl Scout Council. "So we do encourage 
telephone sales . . . to friends and neighbors. The more we keep children away 
from people they don't know, the more we like it." 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, the Northwest Georgia Girl Scout Council, which serves the 
Atlanta area, had its first "cookie seminar" to introduce a telemarketing 
program. The strategy was dreamed up by the Girl Scouts of the USA and its 
cookie licensees. 
</P>
<P>
Angela Fuller, one of the area's top cookie sellers, saw the benefits 
immediately. When the 15-year-old from Acworth, Ga. was "a little girl," she 
said, she could sell between 300 and 500 boxes by knocking on doors, manning 
cookie booths in her community and roping in her parents for assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Then she turned 13 and found the telephone. Like any seasoned telemarketer, 
Angela relies heavily on a good customer list -- the membership directory of 
the Mars Hill Presbyterian Church and her family's address book. 
</P>
<P>
"There's about 300 members in my church," she says. "I get in contact with all 
of them, plus about 50 family members. I'm the only kid in my family and my 
parents work late, so I have the phone all to myself. . . . I try to leave two 
weeks where I have no homework at all. I sit down from about 3:45 till about 6 
and make phone calls." 
</P>
<P>
At 13, she sold 1,400 boxes. At 14, she sold 1,600 boxes. At 15, she figures 
she will sell only 700 or 800 boxes, but not for lack of trying. There are more 
Girl Scouts in her church now, and the competition for sales to church members 
is much stiffer. 
</P>
<P>
In Tuskegee, Ala., Girl Scout Troop 188 went even farther afield than the local 
church, literally tearing up the telephone directory and handing a chunk to 
each scout. Sales went up, said Carolyn Bland, one of the troop's two leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a rural area, and a lot of the girls don't have a lot of neighbors," 
Bland said. "The main contacts are by telephone." 
</P>
<P>
The Girl Scouts of Southwestern Connecticut had mixed luck when it ran a pilot 
telemarketing project in 1989. In the rural community of Westin -- an area of 
weekend homes and affluent families -- the participating troop sold 456 boxes 
in six hours. But scouts in the city of Danbury sold a disappointing 91 boxes 
in four hours, said Lois Fusco, the council's director of public relations and 
product sales. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was delivery. When Girl Scouts sell cookies over the phone, they 
are not allowed to deliver them but must set up sites for customer pick-ups. In 
the city, that system didn't work. But Fusco said the experiment was worthwhile 
and will be repeated soon. 
</P>
<P>
"More valuable than the number of boxes they sold was the confidence they 
gained in using their telephone skills," Fusco said. "We saw the shyest girls 
in our troop gain confidence. That's what the Girl Scout program is all about." 
</P>
<P>
And training doesn't stop with the older girls. Although Brownies, Juniors and 
Cadettes are not learning to sell by phone, they are being taught sophisticated 
sales pitches and the means to deliver them so they can increase their sales at 
the door or in booths throughout the community. 
</P>
<P>
Nineteen girls from 5 to 12 years old were put through their paces Tuesday 
afternoon at the Westmoreland Girl Scout Center in Los Angeles in preparation 
for booth sales in the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
The girls split into small groups and pretended to sell to each other, with 
designated customers and saleswomen. The first skit went something like this: 
"We sell cookies." "Oh. How much are they?" "Two-fifty." "I want this one and 
this one and this one." 
</P>
<P>
So, they weren't a passel of little Cal Worthingtons, but it was a start. Then 
it was Delmy Hernandez's turn. 
</P>
<P>
"Would you like to buy some Girl Scout cookies?" the 11-year-old asked her awed 
partner. "They are tasty and delicious. You will never find them in the store. 
This is your last opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Give that girl a phone. 
</P>

QUAKE AREA MOPS UP, HEAVES A SIGH OF RELIEF; 
</P>
<P>
TEMBLOR: FOOTHILL CITIES COUNT 30 INJURIES, MILLIONS IN DAMAGE. EXPERTS SAY 
THREAT OF LARGER QUAKE HAS LESSENED.

<P>
Communities at the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains counted 30 injuries and 
nearly $14 million in earthquake damage to structures, but residents who spent 
Thursday sweeping up broken glass and replacing toppled books acknowledged that 
it could have been worse. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we all know we were fortunate this time around," said Upland City 
Councilman Al Canestro. 
</P>
<P>
The 5.5-magnitude quake struck Wednesday afternoon three miles northwest of 
Upland. It shook down chimneys and brick facades and shattered windows in 
Upland, Pomona, Claremont, La Verne and Ontario. Felt over a vast sector of 
Southern California, the rolling quake lasted 15 seconds or more, but did 
relatively little harm. 
</P>
<P>
In the first 24 hours after the quake, Caltech seismologists recorded 34 
significant aftershocks. But the threat of an even larger associated quake had 
lessened by Thursday, said Lucile Jones of the U.S. Geological Survey. 
</P>
<P>
While safety inspectors fanned out to look for gas leaks and hidden damage 
Thursday, life returned to normal for most residents and merchants -- but not 
for about 25 residents of a turn-of-the-century Upland apartment building who 
were left temporarily homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Most of them are poor and can barely afford the $420 a month charged for a 
two-bedroom apartment. Many speak no English. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no money for the deposit and rent for a new place, and we are too 
afraid to come back here -- even if they let us," said Carlos Arciniega, 41, 
who, with other evacuees, spent Wednesday night in motel rooms furnished by the 
Red Cross. "My girls kept waking up and shouting, 'Papa! Papa!' "he said. "What 
can I do? They are so scared." 
</P>
<P>
Late Thursday, officials told the tenants they could move back home. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in Upland, joggers ran through the morning fog and schools opened as 
normal, but with psychologists on hand to help students with their quake fears. 
Most businesses were also open as usual. 
</P>
<P>
"I opened at 11, just like I have for 19 years," said Mary Sandberg, 72, owner 
of the Last Chance consignment shop on 2nd Avenue, as she swept debris from the 
sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
Upland building inspectors -- aided by inspectors on loan from the cities of 
Rialto and Montclair -- fanned out throughout the commercial area to check on 
damage reports received through the night. 
</P>
<P>
"We had reports of staircases torn away from apartment buildings, roof damage 
and one gentleman who said his floor was collapsing under him," city building 
chief Don Ramsey said. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the attention was focused on Upland's historic downtown, where 67 
unreinforced masonry buildings dating to the turn of the century already were 
scheduled for retrofitting to meet state earthquake safety standards. Ramsey 
said damage there appeared minor and that the worst incident was a fire that 
destroyed a home. 
</P>
<P>
"We were lucky, very lucky," said Upland Mayor Bob Nolan, who estimated the 
earthquake caused $2.8-million damage to his town. "Now it's a matter of 
getting things in order and getting back to the business of running the city." 
</P>
<P>
Pomona Mayor Donna Smith said inspectors estimate that her city suffered about 
$10 million in damage -- lower than the $20 million she had suggested on 
Wednesday. The city Fire Department said that includes about $2.5 million in 
damage at Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center, where a broken water line 
damaged ceilings and floors. City Hall also was damaged. 
</P>
<P>
The Phillips Mansion, a city historical landmark built in 1875, was declared 
unsafe because of damage to the brick and wood structure. In all, about 300 
structures in Pomona suffered damage, and the City Council planned to meet 
today to ask the county Board of Supervisors and Gov. George Deukmejian to 
declare a state of emergency that would make state aid available. 
</P>
<P>
In the mountains above Upland, boulders were still blocking roads Thursday and 
the harrowing sound of falling rocks could be heard. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, a rock four or five feet in diameter thundered into Mt. 
Baldy Village and smashed into the back of a vacant house. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody (in town) heard it coming in," said Mt. Baldy Fire Department 
engineer Bill Buehler. 
</P>
<P>
Alonzo Jimenez II climbed over rocks and waded through waist-deep water to 
retrieve his bicycle and wallet from a narrow trail in the mountains above 
Glendora on Thursday. He and his son, Alonzo (Lonnie) Jimenez III, were out 
riding when they were buried in a rockslide in the minutes after the temblor 
struck Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Their helmets were crushed by the rocks, but they managed to free themselves. 
The only bad injury was Lonnie's broken arm. 
</P>
<P>
"It's luck," Lonnie said Thursday. "That was the first time I wore a helmet. My 
dad kept bugging me and bugging me about it until I did." 
</P>
<P>
A new slide at 11 a.m. Thursday covered a portion of Mt. Baldy Road, which 
remained closed to all motorists except residents, and will remain so for at 
least two more days. In addition to the laborious task of clearing boulders 
from the roadway, crews must shore up the sides of the highway to safeguard 
against additional landslides, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid it's going to be quite a while before we get that road open," CHP 
spokeswoman Vivian Firlein said. "We know the skiers aren't happy about that, 
because there's good skiing up there now. But we can only do our best." 
</P>
<P>
California 39 was open Thursday as far as Crystal Lake but closed above East 
Fork Road, which intersects the highway about 38 miles north of Interstate 10, 
the CHP reported. Angeles Crest Highway, the main route into the mountains, was 
open. 
</P>
<P>
In Claremont, the estimated $1-million loss discovered Thursday included damage 
to small businesses along Harvard Avenue. City workers also had to vacate the 
60-year-old Jacobsen Building because inspectors found damage there, Assistant 
City Manager Bridget Distelrath said. 
</P>
<P>
In nearby La Verne, the City Council decided Thursday to cancel the state of 
emergency it had called after the quake. Damage there was likely to total less 
than $750,000, although 62 buildings were involved, said Mayor Pro Tem Thomas 
R. Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. David Dreier (R-La Verne) toured the area and said he did not think 
federal assistance would be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in San Bernardino County said it would take several days before they 
could attach a dollar amount to the damage, which appeared to be minimal. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pretty much back to a normal mode here. We came through it pretty much 
unscathed," said Al Langworthy, emergency preparedness planner for San 
Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
"The greatest concern we had was the short failure of our 911 system and the 
total overload of conventional phone lines," Langworthy said. 
</P>
<P>
Warren reported from San Bernardino County and Roderick from Los Angeles. Times 
staff writers Irene Chang and Mike Ward contributed to this report.

ON CALIFORNIA: THE MYSTIQUE THAT DRAWS THE PRESIDENTS

RANCHO MIRAGE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Drive past Palm Springs, going down the valley, and you will soon come to 
Rancho Mirage. Turn left on the boulevard named for Frank Sinatra, keep going 
to the intersection of Bob Hope Drive, and then you will see it. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, you won't see "it." What you will see are the armed guards, the 
fences topped with three strands of barbed wire, and the rows of trees that are 
designed to keep you from being witness to anything, great or small, that 
happens within the confines of the Annenberg estate. Whatever secret qualities 
made this place the San Simeon of its age are not for your eyes. 
</P>
<P>
But the proof of its allure will be demonstrated again tonight. Catch the 
evening news and you will see yet one more President of the United States 
making his ritualized arrival at the gates. This time it will be the Bush 
motorcade gliding down the boulevard, car lights blinking, little American 
flags flying from the fenders. The limos will turn into the compound, the iron 
gates will open, and the procession will disappear inside. 
</P>
<P>
There is no other private residence in the world that performs this function. 
Before Bush, Reagan came twice a year, before Reagan there was Ford and before 
that there was Nixon. In between it was Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles, who 
tried to hit polo balls from a golf cart. 
</P>
<P>
This time Bush has come to the estate to meet with the new Japanese prime 
minister, Toshiki Kaifu. They will hold "trade talks," and maybe play a little 
golf on the nine-hole course inside the estate. On Saturday the iron gates will 
reopen, out will come the limos, and the Annenberg estate will settle back into 
the quiet of the desert, its mystery intact. 
</P>
<P>
We have watched this scene re-enacted so often on television that the Annenberg 
estate has become part of the cultural background, almost invisible. Anchor 
people say "Annenberg estate" the same way they say "Camp David." We do not 
ask, anymore, why a Philadelphia millionaire would plop himself down in the 
California desert and, more remarkable still, manage to have the world come to 
his door rather than vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
Sunnylands, it's called, and there is a story there. When Walter Annenberg 
decided he wanted a place in the desert back in 1961, he did not simply buy 
someone else's creation. He purchased 205 acres of raw sand at the edge of town 
and set about transforming it to a private Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
He succeeded, probably beyond his own original vision. The golf course is said 
to be one of the most handsome anywhere. When a first-time visitor came to play 
several years ago, Annenberg instructed him not to bother replacing his own 
divots. Sure enough, as the round began, the visitor noticed an Annenberg 
retainer following the group at a discreet distance, retrieving each clump of 
grass thrown into the air by their clubs. 
</P>
<P>
It is said that inside the estate the only sounds come from the cormorants and 
egrets nesting on the small lakes. In the main house hangs one of the foremost 
art collections in the world. On a given evening you can walk to the dining 
room and pass more Cezannes and Van Goghs than Sotheby's will see in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Even the water is special. When Annenberg bought the property, he realized that 
his aquatic needs would be substantial, so he purchased the company that owned 
the underground rights. Private wells now supply the swimming pool, the golf 
course, the lakes and ponds. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, mere luxury does not explain why this particular piece of real 
estate has become a magnet for one President after another. There are many 
billionaires, and many estates. 
</P>
<P>
But there are not many contained universes. There are few places, no matter how 
expensive, that can provide such a shield from the rest of us, the air of 
mystery and seclusion, as these particular 205 acres. Once, when an aide to 
former President Reagan was asked by a reporter why his boss spent so many 
apparently blissful days at Sunnylands, he replied, "because you're not there, 
and you can't get there." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that gets to the essence of Sunnylands. What we have here is a place, 
planted in the sands of Rancho Mirage, that has the power to infuse its guests 
with the trappings of royalty. Outside there may be murder and mayhem in the 
streets, but inside there is Arcadia and peace. A place where the normal rules 
don't apply. 
</P>
<P>
A neat trick, if you are Walter Annenberg. So neat that Presidents and princes 
can't resist, and the limos continue to line up, one after the other.

THE FEEL OF A QUAKE: WHY THE DIFFERENCE?; 
</P>
<P>
SEISMOLOGY: WHETHER IT'S A JOLT OR A ROLLING MOTION DEPENDS ON THE DISTANCE 
FROM THE EPICENTER.

Why does one earthquake feel so much different from another? 
</P>
<P>
The earthquake that rattled through Southern California on Wednesday may have 
felt quite different to people who experienced the Montebello quake last June 
12, even if they were in the same place both times. 
</P>
<P>
Workers in office buildings in downtown Los Angeles, for example, reported 
feeling a sharp jolt from the 4.5 magnitude Montebello quake, whereas 
Wednesday's 5.5 temblor produced a long rolling motion. 
</P>
<P>
Why should one earthquake produce sharp jolts and another make the Earth roll 
back and forth like a ship at sea? 
</P>
<P>
The short answer is that one quake was closer than the other. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's quake felt "different" to many Los Angeles residents because "it 
was farther away," said seismologist Lucile Jones of the U.S. Geological 
Survey's Pasadena office. "That's the main thing." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's quake was centered three miles northwest of Upland, about 40 miles 
east of downtown Los Angeles. The Montebello quake, by contrast, was only about 
six miles from the Central City area. 
</P>
<P>
An earthquake produces energy that moves out in all directions in the form of 
seismic waves. The waves are emitted over a wide range of frequencies, from low 
frequencies that cause a rolling motion to high frequencies that cause sudden 
jolts. 
</P>
<P>
As the seismic waves radiate out from the quake, they are "attenuated," or 
dampened, by the soils and rocks through which they travel. Thus the ground 
absorbs the energy of the shock waves, causing them eventually to die out, but 
"it doesn't do it evenly over all frequencies," Jones added. 
</P>
<P>
An earthquake centered nearby "feels jerky because you are feeling all the 
frequencies," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The higher frequency waves -- the ones that cause the sudden jolts -- dampen 
out quickly as the distance from the epicenter grows. 
</P>
<P>
But the low-frequency waves roll along, and "just as you can hear a low-pitched 
sound far away, you can feel the low-frequency waves at a greater distance," 
Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
The waves also travel through the Earth at different speeds. The fastest wave, 
called the "P" (primary) wave, arrives first and it usually registers a sharp 
jolt. 
</P>
<P>
"The P wave tends to be a higher frequency," Jones said. "It feels more abrupt, 
but it attenuates very quickly, so if you are far away you often won't feel the 
P wave." 
</P>
<P>
The second waves to arrive are called "S" (secondary) waves, and while these 
high-frequency waves are slower they are also larger, so they produce a much 
stronger jolt. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the low-frequency waves rumble through, causing the ground to roil. 
</P>
<P>
When the Upland quake struck, Jones and her colleagues in Pasadena knew "it had 
to be quite a distance because it was a long, low rumble and it lasted quite a 
while." The fact that it lasted "quite a while" also told the seismologists 
that it was a substantial quake. 
</P>
<P>
She said she guessed the magnitude, 5.5, and the location "right away." But she 
admits she had a little help on the location because a smaller quake had struck 
Upland three hours earlier and she concluded correctly that it had been a 
foreshock to the larger quake. 
</P>
<P>
Seismologists can also estimate the distance to the epicenter fairly accurately 
just by noting how much longer it takes the S waves to arrive after the P 
waves. 
</P>
<P>
"If you feel the P wave and count the seconds until the S wave," you can tell 
how far away the quake is, Jones said. The S wave travels 5 miles per second 
slower than the P wave, so if the difference is 5 seconds the epicenter is 25 
miles away, she added. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, you have to recognize the P wave," she said. 
</P>
<P>
As the waves travel through the Earth they interact dramatically with the 
medium through which they travel. Sand, loose soil and even clay actually 
amplify the waves. 
</P>
<P>
Someone standing on such soils would feel the energy from the quake far more 
intensely than someone standing on rock, which transmits the wave very 
efficiently and thus is jolted less. 
</P>
<P>
The same holds true for structures, which tend to function far better if they 
are built on rock than if they are constructed on loose soils that are so 
common throughout the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
Thus people, or structures, the same distance from an earthquake would have a 
very different experience if they were on different types of soils. 
</P>
<P>
But for someone who happened to be at the same place for more than one quake -- 
such as at home or at work -- the primary factor determining how the earthquake 
"feels" is the distance and the magnitude of the temblor.

SOUTHLAND ROLLS WITH THE PUNCH OF A MODERATE ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
This time around, there was little call for a wrecking ball, and barely a 
bulldozer was needed. No bridges had collapsed, no city blocks were ablaze, no 
World Series was postponed. The Jaws of Life were held in reserve, awaiting the 
next freeway smashup. 
</P>
<P>
Call it the handyman's earthquake, more a fix-it job than a catastrophe. The 
Moderate One was made to order for a putty knife in the hands of a glazier, and 
a good excuse for do-it-yourselfers to stay home from work. The Builders 
Emporium in La Verne witnessed a run on flexible gas lines for water heaters, 
while Montclair's Home Club sold dozens of a newfangled earthquake alarm that 
is designed to give a few seconds warning before a shaker. 
</P>
<P>
For many, Wednesday's earthquake meant Thursday's profits, with more to come. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, we lost some stock, but it's good for business," Greg Johnson, 
proprietor of Claremont Paint &amp; Glass, said as he took an empty aluminum 
frame from a customer. By 3 p.m., Johnson had taken more than 20 orders for new 
windows -- and he only handles residential work. "A lot of big picture 
windows," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Broken glass is an immediate priority, but there are also chimneys to rebuild, 
foundations to check, and picture frames to repair. There is an abundance of 
work for masons, contractors, engineers and insurance agents who serve Upland, 
Pomona, Ontario, Claremont, Montclair, San Dimas and other communities roughed 
up by the 5.5-magnitude temblor. 
</P>
<P>
Business was busy -- but, it seemed, not overwhelming. Some contractors and 
glass companies said they had received only a few calls more than normal, 
nothing they couldn't handle. 
</P>
<P>
At Mission Glass, Pat McArthur had an ominous theory about that. "I guess 
everybody's waiting to see if it's over," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Such thinking prevailed at the big hardware centers. 
</P>
<P>
"After the quakes, they get concerned and try to think of things to do to 
prevent more damage," said Dave Urquidi, manager of the Builders Emporium. 
Plywood was a popular item, and water heater supplies were another. The shaking 
had cracked many gas lines. 
</P>
<P>
Urquidi estimated that 60 pieces of line were sold Wednesday night, exhausting 
the store's supply. The store placed an order for more and sold 150 pieces 
Thursday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
That item was also a big seller at the Home Club, said manager Steve Fellin, as 
was an alarm called "California Quake Awake." 
</P>
<P>
David Elliot, president of California Quake Awake Inc., said the alarm, like an 
animal's ears, reacts to a quake's sound frequency, or "P wave." If the alarm 
is 60 miles from the epicenter of a temblor, a beep will provide a 12- to 
15-second early warning, Elliot said. The alarm, on the market since January, 
1989, and priced at about $25, is selling "very well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Waiting out aftershocks is only one reason why homeowners and business people 
may wait to call on contractors. For some, contractor Greg Anderson predicted, 
there are dealings with insurance companies to determine whether damage will 
exceed the typical $10,000 deductible on quake insurance, 
</P>
<P>
"This quake was by no means as bad as Whittier," said Anderson, whose San Dimas 
firm handled several major home reconstruction jobs after the October, 1987, 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
On the road to several non-quake-related job estimates Thursday morning, 
Anderson said he noticed dozens of cracked and damaged chimneys. 
</P>
<P>
"We might get some jobs in the next couple weeks," he said, "but the real work 
will come months down the road, after people get their low-interest government 
loans." 
</P>
<P>
While some contractors blanket quake-damaged neighborhoods with leaflets 
advertising their services, Anderson said: "There's no reason to rush out. It 
makes us seem like vultures." 
</P>
<P>
But for glaziers such as Johnson, the pace was fast. Several customers, he 
said, were planning to replace their picture windows with tempered glass -- 
"safety glass" that disintegrates into small pieces rather than dangerous 
shards. 
</P>
<P>
At Wolfe's Market in Claremont, glazier James Benson of College Glass &amp; 
Mirror was glad to be outside replacing three large storefront windows -- one 
of several jobs this day. Jeff Hodges, an upholsterer by trade, was assisting. 
"He's jammed up and I'm not," Hodges said. 
</P>
<P>
When the Moderate One hit, Benson recalled, he was in the firm's storeroom, and 
he didn't think that it was so moderate. He made a run for it, and heard 30 
sheets of 5-by-8-foot glass panes crash to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"That would have been the worst place to stand around," Benson said.

DROUGHT COPS PATROL STREETS OF SANTA BARBARA 
</P>

SANTA BARBARA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chief of the drought police was on patrol in the streets of west Santa 
Barbara when he spotted his first clue: water in the gutter. He pulled over, 
studied the flow for a moment and then examined a nearby lawn. 
</P>
<P>
"There's evidence all over the place," said drought officer Mike Morales as he 
ran a hand over the damp lawn and examined a still-wet sprinkler head. "This is 
flagrant." 
</P>
<P>
Morales is the head of a three-person staff created by the city of Santa 
Barbara to enforce its harsh new water conservation measures. Faced with a 
water shortage of almost 50% this year because of the ongoing drought, the City 
Council earlier this week voted to make watering lawns illegal. The ordinance 
also prohibits residents from using hoses to water trees and shrubs. 
</P>
<P>
Morales and the two other drought officers patrol the city streets, looking for 
telltale signs like wet gutters and puddles on the sidewalk. They also respond 
to calls. So far, The officers have received about 30 calls a day, mostly from 
residents who have spotted neighbors watering their lawns. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't consider the number of calls to be particularly high . . . mainly 
because the ban was only recently announced," Morales said. "Overall, we feel 
most people are complying with the order." 
</P>
<P>
After studying the front lawn of the west Santa Barbara house with the wet 
gutters, he spotted the culprit in the back yard. Morales introduced himself 
and informed the man that watering lawns is now prohibited in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Lang, the homeowner, shrugged sheepishly. He knew about the water 
restrictions, he said, but he had just put in a new lawn and sprinkler system. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured I'd water one last time and hope for rain," Lang said. He gazed at 
his lawn wistfully. "But the lawn will probably die anyway. And all that time 
and money I put into it will be wasted." 
</P>
<P>
Lang got off easy this time -- only a verbal warning. But the city soon will 
start issuing citations to transgressors, said Bill Ferguson, Santa Barbara's 
water development planner. A warning citation will be issued for the first 
offense; second and third offenses could result in fines and a fourth violation 
could lead to shut-off of a resident's water service. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless we get some incredible rainstorms, the watering ban will be in effect 
for at least the coming year," Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
Morales, 54, was hired by the city last month to enforce a number of water 
conservation measures. He drives around town in a white pickup truck with 
"Drought Officer" stenciled on the door, along with the city seal. 
</P>
<P>
When Morales began his day Thursday, he had a list of homes to check out. 
During the night, about 10 residents had called a city hot line to report 
violators. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't look at it as snitching," Morales said. "We're all in this drought 
together. And if we didn't get the cooperation of people, we'd need a lot more 
officers and a lot more water would be wasted." 
</P>
<P>
Responding to one tip, Morales arrived at a group of condominiums in the city's 
eastern foothills. A neighbor was waiting out in front, drinking coffee and 
smoking a cigarette. He pointed out to Morales a wet lawn, puddles on the 
sidewalk and a broken sprinkler head. Morales promised to obtain the names of 
all the condominium owners and remind them of the watering ban. 
</P>
<P>
During the course of his morning patrol, no residents openly resisted Morales 
or expressed hostility. Most listened to what he had to say and nodded wearily. 
</P>
<P>
But some, even in the face of overwhelming evidence, refuse to admit 
culpability. One man, whose lawn had been watered during the night, opened the 
door in his bathrobe and told Morales: "The gardener must have done it." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Morales spotted a trail of water flowing through the gutters. He drove 
slowly for several blocks, following the stream, until he located the source: a 
small tract home. The lawn was drenched. 
</P>
<P>
When Morales confronted a woman at the front door, she stared at him wide-eyed 
and declared: "I haven't watered any lawn." 
</P>
<P>
Problems like these will soon be solved, Morales said, when a drought officer 
is assigned to the night shift and can catch scofflaws in the act. 
</P>
<P>
Morales, who used to own a small energy conservation firm, knows that his job 
security is tied to the city's current bad fortune. Santa Barbara is entering 
its customary dry season, so he is virtually assured of employment through the 
end of summer. 
</P>
<P>
"But after the next good rain," Morales said, "I know I could be gone."

DEMOCRATS DEEPLY SPLIT OVER MOVE TO CURB 'SOFT' CAMPAIGN FUNDS; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: A BILL WOULD CLOSE A LOOPHOLE THAT LETS PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEES FUNNEL 
MILLIONS TO STATE PARTIES. ITS FOES SAY IT WOULD HURT LOCAL RACES.

<P>
The Democratic Party is deeply divided over legislation sponsored by Senate 
Democratic leaders that would prohibit presidential candidates from continuing 
to use a legal loophole to raise millions of dollars that escape federal limits 
on campaign fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
With the support of Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown, an irate group of 
state party chairmen is lobbying Congress strenuously to oppose legislation 
co-sponsored by Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) and Sen. 
David L. Boren (D-Okla.). 
</P>
<P>
The Boren-Mitchell bill, which is scheduled to come to the Senate floor this 
month, has wide support among Senate Democrats. It is a direct outgrowth of the 
so-called "Keating Five" scandal, in which Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and 
four other senators have been criticized for soliciting large sums from Charles 
H. Keating Jr., owner of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
But party leaders are concerned that the Senate Democrats, in their zeal to 
clean up campaign financing, would cut off a large source of funds, known as 
"soft money," for state party organizations 
</P>
<P>
Presidential campaigns have been funded by the U.S. Treasury since 1976. But 
presidential candidates in recent years have been soliciting money from private 
contributors and funneling it through state parties for voter registration and 
get-out-the-vote efforts. Although this "soft money" clearly is intended to 
benefit presidential candidates, it escapes federal regulation because it 
technically is spent on behalf of state and local candidates. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, both Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael S. Dukakis openly 
raised "soft money" contributions of as much as $100,000 from rich individuals 
to supplement their public funding. It is estimated that, together, they took 
in about $45 million in such funds -- or nearly half as much as the $92.2 
million in public funds they received from the government. 
</P>
<P>
The California Republican and Democratic parties were the leading recipients of 
"soft money" in 1988, according to a study by the Center for Responsive 
Politics. 
</P>
<P>
Critics argue that such contributions have grown so massive that they are 
beginning to undermine the system of public financing that was intended to 
prevent presidential candidates from soliciting large contributions from rich 
donors. 
</P>
<P>
As Common Cause President Fred Wertheimer asserted: "Eastern Airlines head 
Frank Lorenzo did not give $100,000 to the Bush 'soft money' drive in order to 
help get out votes for a state auditor's race." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Boren-Mitchell bill seeks to prevent presidential and 
congressional candidates from funneling "soft money" contributions into state 
party organizations. 
</P>
<P>
But Democratic state party chairmen strongly object on grounds that that would 
virtually destroy their ability to operate voter registration and get-out-the 
vote drives on behalf of state and local candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"What they want to do is federalize our elections," James Ruvolo, chairman of 
the Ohio Democratic Party, complained. "We should not be punished because 
someone perceived that there's too much money going into campaigns. Every time 
the federal government touches an election, they make it worse." 
</P>
<P>
Ruvolo said that the Democratic state chairmen have organized a committee to 
bring pressure on members of Congress to reject a ban on "soft money" 
contributions to state parties. "What we want is a bill that reflects reality," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans are almost unanimously opposed to the Boren-Mitchell bill. 
President Bush has proposed alternative legislation that would require public 
disclosure of all "soft money" contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Ginsberg, general counsel of the Republican National Committee, said that 
the "soft money" ban proposed by Boren and Mitchell fails to recognize the 
importance of voter registration and get-out-the-vote activities in state and 
local races. "If you ban 'soft money,' there will be no pool of money to 
support state and local candidates, and that is nuts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The issue has been a particularly touchy one for Cranston, who has admitted 
raising large quantities of "soft money" for the California Democratic Party 
during his 1986 reelection campaign, including an $85,000 donation from 
Keating. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston testified before the Senate Rules Committee Tuesday that the proposed 
ban on "soft money" will be ineffective because, even though federal candidates 
could not funnel money through state parties, they could channel it through 
outside groups such as organizations established to campaign for statewide 
ballot initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Soft money' would still pour into elections and into the specific activities 
mentioned in the bill -- voter registration drives and get-out-the vote 
activities -- but state parties would be effectively stopped from carrying out 
these functions," Cranston said.

FIRE SWEEPS LUXURY CAIRO HOTEL; 16 INCLUDING AN AMERICAN ARE KILLED

Fire broke out in a luxury hotel's tent restaurant early Thursday, and 
wind-whipped flames leaped to the main building, killing 16 people and injuring 
about 70. At least one American was among the dead. 
</P>
<P>
Frantic guests at the six-story Heliopolis Sheraton jumped from windows and 
clambered down bedsheets that they tied together. Many of the injuries were 
broken bones suffered in falls. 
</P>
<P>
A relative identified the American victim as Robert D. Cresap, 67, a retired 
accountant from Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Three Americans were seriously injured, said police Brig. Abdel Rehim Kenawy. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze broke out at 1 a.m. and burned for nine hours. The hotel northeast of 
Cairo has no fire alarms or sprinklers, and many guests heard of the fire from 
other guests. 
</P>
<P>
Tourism Minister Fuad Sultan said the blaze started accidentally in the Nubian 
Tent restaurant -- a cotton canvas tent attached to one of the three blocks of 
the T-shaped hotel. The head of Cairo's fire brigade, Maj. Gen. Adel Nigm, said 
such tents are fire hazards and the Sheraton put it up without consulting the 
fire department. 
</P>
<P>
Sparks jumped from a clay oven to the ceiling of the tent, igniting flames that 
quickly spread to the hotel, Sultan said. Officials said the use of hotel tents 
will be reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
The Heliopolis Sheraton, about 10 years old, is the only one of Egypt's six 
Sheratons without an alarm system or sprinklers. Sultan said they are not 
mandatory under Egyptian law.

U.S., SOVIETS PLAN STUDY OF BREAST CANCER PREVENTION; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: AN ANTI-ESTROGEN DRUG WOULD BE USED. THE PROJECT WOULD INVOLVE 20,000 
WOMEN.

<P>
American and Soviet cancer specialists signed an agreement here Thursday for a 
10-year, $100-million study of 20,000 women in the two countries to determine 
whether a hormonal treatment can prevent breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Phillip D. Bretz, director of the Desert Breast Institute in Rancho Mirage, 
Calif., said that women thought to be most likely to develop breast cancer 
would be given tamoxifen, an anti-estrogen drug, and then be closely monitored 
by breast cancer specialists to see whether the drug could be used in 
preventive treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"Tamoxifen appears to be both the most promising and safest of all the drugs we 
know about for the prevention of breast cancer," Bretz said. "In the United 
States, the Soviet Union and in many industrialized countries, breast cancer is 
the most prevalent cancer among women." 
</P>
<P>
Tamoxifen, which is manufactured by the British firm Imperial Chemical 
Industries and sold under the brand name Nolvadex, has been used with 
considerable success for 11 years in the post-surgical treatment of breast 
cancer patients to prevent a recurrence, Bretz said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed study is the first undertaken on such a scale jointly in the 
United States and the Soviet Union. The patients, about 10,000 each from the 
Soviet Union and the United States, will primarily be the daughters, sisters or 
mothers of women who have had breast cancer and thus are regarded as the most 
likely to develop cancer themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The treatment involves taking two tablets a day. The researchers said that 
tamoxifen has minimal negative side effects and often reduces cholesterol and 
eases cardiovascular problems. 
</P>
<P>
Tamoxifen works by blocking so-called estrogen receptors -- areas on the 
surface of cells to which the hormone binds to exert its effects. In that way, 
it blocks the effects of estrogen, which plays a role in the development and 
progression of breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet women who were exposed to large amounts of radiation after the nuclear 
accident at Chernobyl in April, 1986, will also be included in the study, with 
the hope of preventing the development of breast cancer among them, according 
to Dr. David Zaridze, deputy director of the All-Union Cancer Research 
Institute in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
A new blood test, developed by Dr. Adeline Hackett of the Aeron Corp. of 
Oakland, Calif., and researchers at UC Berkeley is being used in the Ukrainian 
capital of Kiev, where many of the Chernobyl victims are treated, to measure 
the amount of radiation absorbed by each woman. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that radiation is carcinogenic for humans, but we do not know how 
carcinogenic -- that is, how much radiation is likely to increase the risk of 
various cancers and leukemias," Zaridze said. "In Hiroshima and Nagasaki (on 
which atomic bombs were dropped in World War II), there was an increase in all 
cancers and leukemias, but only about 300 cases of solid tumors and the same 
number of leukemias were directly attributed to radiation. We need to know more 
about how radiation causes tumors, and with this blood test we believe we can." 
</P>
<P>
Another blood test, also developed by Hackett, will be used to assess the level 
of tamoxifen in each woman's body and her response to the drug. 
</P>
<P>
The tamoxifen study must still be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration, which will hold an open hearing in Washington next month on the 
proposed scope and method of the research, but the U.S. researchers expressed 
confidence that the project would be approved and fully under way by the end of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
Bretz said he expects the study's $100-million cost to be financed primarily 
with grants from the U.S. and Soviet governments and by pharmaceutical 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
The project will be coordinated in the United States by Bretz and Dr. Philip B. 
Dreisbach of the Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage and in the Soviet 
Union by Zaridze at the national Cancer Research Center and carried out in 
various cities in each country. 
</P>
<P>
"This drug has already proven to work in sustaining the post-operative 
remission in women who have had breast cancer and in preventing the spread of 
cancer to the other breast," Dreisbach said. "The time has come to determine 
whether it can prevent breast cancer." 
</P>
<P>
In cases where breast cancer does develop among Soviet women, the project will 
also include the use of early laser surgery rather than radical surgery, 
radiation or chemotherapy, Bretz said.

KAIFU PRESENTS A BLUEPRINT TO ENRICH LIFE FOR JAPANESE; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE: HIS PLAN EMPHASIZES INCREASED DOMESTIC SPENDING. IT MIRRORS STEPS URGED 
BY U.S. NEGOTIATORS TO INCREASE JAPAN'S IMPORTS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, saying that talks with the United States aimed at 
removing impediments to trade are "the most urgent and important topic" on 
Japan's agenda, today presented a sweeping blueprint to enrich life for the 
Japanese people. 
</P>
<P>
His proposals in a speech to Parliament mirrored steps urged by U.S. trade 
negotiators as ways to increase Japanese consumer spending and thus Japanese 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu, who is scheduled to depart tonight for two days of meetings with 
President Bush in Palm Springs, enumerated a host of new proposals and promises 
stressing for the first time consumer welfare and daily life. 
</P>
<P>
"The solution of U.S.-Japan trade and economic problems," he told Parliament, 
"is the greatest policy issue our nation faces, and as part of that issue, the 
Structural Impediments Initiative talks rank as the most urgent and important 
topic." 
</P>
<P>
The speech appeared to affirm the high-level political support in Japan that 
American negotiators say is needed to push to a successful conclusion a 
yearlong series of trade talks called the Structural Impediments Initiative. 
Bush has made them the centerpiece of his economic policy toward Japan on 
grounds that they are a key to higher Japanese consumption and foreign 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
It also showed a politically invigorated Kaifu, fresh from an unexpectedly 
solid victory in the Feb. 18 election for the lower house of Parliament. Until 
today, the 59-year-old leader, plucked from obscurity last August in the 
aftermath of scandals and an upper house election defeat for the ruling Liberal 
Democratic Party, had offered no major new policy initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
Overseas, Kaifu declared, Japan will use its economic power, technological 
skills and experience to participate in the creation of a new world order. 
</P>
<P>
At home, he pledged to create "a fair society in which affluence of the heart 
can be achieved" by enriching daily living, solving land and housing problems 
and correcting discrepancies between prices at home and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese, Kaifu complained, "endure too much study when they are children, too 
much work when they are adults and too much time when they are retired." Women, 
he added, bear too much of the burden of child-rearing and caring for the aged. 
</P>
<P>
As a first step, he announced what he called a "10-year strategy to promote 
health and welfare for the aged" that would seek to reduce the number of 
bedridden to zero while vastly expanding health and welfare facilities and 
increasing the number of home helpers for the aged. 
</P>
<P>
He also promised more child-care facilities to enable women to use their 
talents equally with men and said he would expand employment opportunities for 
older workers up to the age of 65. 
</P>
<P>
A fund to support the arts and culture also will be set up, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu promised to draw up a reform of real estate taxes in fiscal 1990, which 
begins April 1; apply residential tax rates to farmland in large cities in 
fiscal 1992 to increase the supply of land for homes; build 1 million living 
units in the Tokyo area in the next 10 years; rationalize the distribution 
system; strictly enforce the Anti-Monopoly Law, and reduce working hours. 
</P>
<P>
All of the promises matched reforms that U.S. negotiators have urged Japan to 
embrace in the trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials insist that prohibitive land costs, inadequate housing 
and high prices impede business and hinder spending on consumer goods and 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, S. Linn Williams, deputy U.S. trade representative, accused Kaifu 
of failing to provide "political guidance" to his negotiators at the Structural 
Impediments Initiative talks. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu today praised the talks, in which each country is suggesting reforms in 
the other. He said they will contribute both to the improvement of the quality 
of life in Japan and the strengthening of competitive power in the United 
States. He added that they "are directly linked to the strengthening of 
cooperative relations between our countries." 
</P>
<P>
"I shall exert my utmost effort for progress in these talks," he pledged. 
</P>
<P>
He warned his own people in the nationally televised speech that the world's 
economic order is "standing at a turning point, with the growth of 
protectionism threatening the existence of the global free trading system." 
</P>
<P>
He pledged to maintain growth led by domestic demand, improve market access for 
imports and enact a new system giving tax breaks to importers of foreign goods. 
He added an appeal to both enterprises and individuals to join the government 
in promoting imports. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu and his entourage are scheduled to arrive in Los Angeles this afternoon 
to change planes en route to Palm Springs. During the 25 hours Kaifu will be in 
Palm Springs, he and Bush are scheduled to spend nearly seven hours together in 
meetings and over meals.

Former President Richard M. Nixon, actress Elizabeth Taylor, Chrysler Corp. 
Chairman Lee A. Iacocca and hundreds of other mourners filled St. Bartholomew's 
Episcopal Church here Thursday for a memorial service for publisher Malcolm 
Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
Forbes, who died Saturday at age 70, loved a good time, from partying to racing 
motorcycles to riding in hot-air balloons, and his memorial service at the Park 
Avenue church had a festive rather than funereal air. 
</P>
<P>
The service featured music on a variety of instruments loved by the Forbes 
magazine owner, including Scottish bagpipes and English horns. 
</P>
<P>
Parked outside the church was Forbes' red, tan and black Harley-Davidson, an 
America flag on one handlebar and the flag of Scotland on the other. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon sat in the front pew of the landmark church, near his daughter Julie 
Eisenhower, Miss Taylor and former Mayor Edward I. Koch. 
</P>
<P>
Other mourners included Barbara Walters, Joan Rivers and David Rockefeller. 
</P>
<P>
In a eulogy, Forbes' son Robert broke down as he said, "I have dreaded this 
moment. It has been a hell of a party. Thanks for the trip." 
</P>
<P>
Forbes' most famous party was a $2-million birthday affair his children threw 
for him last year in Morocco.

G. M. WYNNE; SPY JAILED BY THE SOVIETS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Greville Maynard Wynne, the British spy who was the first Westerner to learn of 
Soviet missiles being shipped into Cuba and who spent 18 months in a Moscow 
prison after being captured, has died of throat cancer, hospital officials said 
Thursday. He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
Wynne died at London's Cromwell Hospital on Wednesday, a British domestic news 
agency reported, quoting unidentified close friends. 
</P>
<P>
The wealthy businessman, who described his exploits in two celebrated memoirs 
-- "The Man From Moscow" and "The Man From Odessa" -- worked for Britain's MI6 
intelligence service. He said he acted as the intermediary for Soviet double 
agent Col. Oleg Penkovsky, a senior military intelligence officer who passed 
Moscow secrets to both MI6 and the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition Labor Party legislator Ted Leadbitter said of Wynne in a statement: 
"How many secrets has this man taken to his grave?" 
</P>
<P>
In 1950 Wynne had set up his own business as an exporter of industrial 
engineering products. It involved a lot of foreign travel, including trips to 
Soviet Bloc countries and thus provided ideal cover for spying. He said he was 
motivated by patriotism and a dislike of the Soviet system. 
</P>
<P>
For a dozen years he carried information to his MI6 and CIA contacts before 
being arrested during a business trip to Budapest, Hungary, in November, 1962. 
He was taken to the Soviet Union where he was put on trial in Moscow on May, 
1963, for spying. He pleaded "guilty with certain reservations" and was 
sentenced to eight years imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
Penkovsky, who was tried with him, was sentenced to death for treason. But he 
reportedly committed suicide in a Soviet labor camp. 
</P>
<P>
Wynne served 18 months in Moscow's Lubyanka Prison. He was freed in 1964 in 
exchange for Soviet spy Conon Molodyl (or Gordon Lonsdale as he called himself 
in Britain). 
</P>
<P>
In another book, "Contact on Gorky Street," published in 1967, Wynne said he 
had first joined the British security service in 1938 and worked for it during 
World War II. In 1960 he made contact with a politically disillusioned 
Penkovsky. 
</P>
<P>
Wynne was assigned to court Penkovsky at about the same time the Soviets 
approached him to spy for them. He spurned that offer, he wrote, but was able 
to forge a trust with Penkovsky, who he described as possibly the West's most 
valuable agent. He said Penkovsky provided him the names and photographs of 
about 300 East Bloc intelligence agents, details of Soviet missile sites, and 
an analysis of Soviet military manpower and weapons production. 
</P>
<P>
He said the double agent also told him Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev had 
allowed important guidance equipment to be sent with Soviet missiles being 
installed in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
The affair developed into the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. Khrushchev later 
backed off and ordered the missiles returned to the Soviet Union after 
President John F. Kennedy ordered a naval quarantine of Cuba.

CARMINE BELLINO; PROBED TEAMSTERS AND WATERGATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carmine S. Bellino, the doggedly determined congressional investigator who 
played a major role in the downfall of Teamsters James R. Hoffa and Dave Beck, 
has died of prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The soft-spoken former FBI agent and one-time aide to President John F. Kennedy 
was 84 and died Tuesday in Coconut Creek, Fla., where he had retired in the 
early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
From the 1950s investigations of Beck and Hoffa by the Senate Select Committee 
on Improper Activities in the Labor and Management Field, to the Senate 
Watergate Committee where he was a leading investigator, Bellino served a 
single self-avowed purpose: 
</P>
<P>
"To make the figures talk." 
</P>
<P>
He had followed the complicated trails of illicit funds since receiving his 
accounting degree from New York University. He became a special agent for the 
FBI in 1934 and had risen to administrative assistant to J. Edgar Hoover by 
1945. 
</P>
<P>
But the man whom Robert F. Kennedy once called "the best investigator in the 
country" grew restless in Hoover's vast bureaucracy and retired to his private 
accounting firm before Congress called upon him. For the next three decades he 
would serve as a staff aide or consulting investigator to the Joint Committee 
on Atomic Energy, the House Health Education and Labor Committee, the House 
Public Roads Committee, the Senate Banking and Currency Committee, the Senate 
Agriculture Committee and more. 
</P>
<P>
He disclosed a "skimming" operation involving slot machines in West Germany 
played by American servicemen; the smuggling of millions of dollars in 
black-market currency out of Vietnam during the war and discovered that Maj. 
Gen. Bennett E. Meyers, deputy chief of procurement for the Air Force during 
World War II, had owned a war factory. 
</P>
<P>
Meyers went to prison and so did John Maragon, a White House aide in the Truman 
Administration who was convicted of perjury during an investigation of 5% fees 
being assessed businessmen who were awarded government contracts. 
</P>
<P>
During the time he was chief investigator for the Senate Watergate Committee in 
1973 -- which investigated the break-in at Democratic national headquarters in 
1972 -- Bellino himself was accused of having ordered electronic surveillance 
of Republican offices to help the Democrats in 1960, the year John F. Kennedy 
defeated Richard M. Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
The charge was made by George Bush, then Republican national chairman. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post reported that Bellino was so thorough that he once 
determined the gross income of an Atlantic City hostelry that figured in an 
illicit sex operation by determining from a laundry the number of towels 
delivered there each week. 
</P>
<P>
Between congressional posts he served as an adviser to President Kennedy and 
the Bureau of the Budget. 
</P>
<P>
He was hired by municipalities across the country and, in 1976, the Los Angeles 
Board of Supervisors brought him in to audit the tax rolls in a disagreement 
over the assessment policies of the late County Assessor Philip Watson. 
</P>
<P>
Bellino's first wife died in 1979. He is survived by his second wife, 
Catherine, seven children from his first marriage and 31 grandchildren.

Cholesterol tests conducted by private testing companies are highly inaccurate 
up to 25% of the time, and some widely used portable testing machines have 
unacceptably high error rates, studies reported in the Journal of the American 
Medical Assn. said. Poorly trained operators are a primary cause of erroneous 
readings, one study found. Three brands of machines were found to have the 
highest error rates -- the Analyst, made by Du Pont Inc., the Seralyzer, made 
by Miles Laboratories Inc., and the Reflotron, made by Boehringer-Mannheim 
Diagnostics Inc. Excess cholesterol in the blood is an indicator of increased 
likelihood of heart disease.

NFL ADDS TWO TEAMS TO PLAYOFFS; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: LUCRATIVE FOUR-YEAR AGREEMENT WITH ABC ALLOWS NETWORK TO KEEP 
MONDAY NIGHT GAMES AND ADD POSTSEASON GAMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The NFL is expanding its playoff format to accommodate ABC, which has also 
successfully retained its "Monday Night Football" television package. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL has decided to add two more wild-card teams, one from each conference. 
Twelve of the 28 teams will reach postseason play instead of 10. 
</P>
<P>
ABC, under a four-year agreement announced Thursday, will continue to televise 
NFL games on Monday nights, as it has been doing since 1970. It will also 
televise two first-round Saturday playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
The ABC deal, sources estimate, is worth between $900 million and $1 billion. 
That breaks down to at least $225 million a season. 
</P>
<P>
Under the previous three-year contract, which expired at the end of last 
season, ABC was paying about $125 million a year for its Monday night games. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new playoff format, expected to be ratified without much dissent 
during the owners' meeting at Orlando, Fla., in two weeks, only the two 
division champions with the best record in each conference will draw a bye in 
the first week of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The third champion would be home to the wild-card team with the worst record, 
and the wild-card team with the best mark would be home to the team with the 
second-best. 
</P>
<P>
Two games would be played on a Saturday, both televised by ABC, and two on a 
Sunday, with NBC and CBS each doing one -- assuming both retain NFL rights. 
</P>
<P>
If the new playoff system had been in effect last season, the two additional 
playoff teams would have been Green Bay (10-6) in the NFC and Kansas City 
(8-7-1) in the AFC. The Packers would have played the Minnesota Vikings, a team 
in their own division, in the first round, and the Chiefs would have met the 
Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
The new format would make it possible for as many as four teams from one 
division to qualify for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
NFL spokesman Joe Browne said that even with 12 teams in the playoffs, the NFL 
still has fewer playoff qualifiers than any major sport except baseball. 
</P>
<P>
In the NBA, 16 of the 27 teams make it; in the NHL, 16 of 21. 
</P>
<P>
As for why the NFL is expanding its playoff format, Browne said: "Additional 
television revenue was an obvious factor. But many clubs had also expressed 
interest in adding playoff teams. This accomplishes the goal of adding new 
teams without diminishing the importance of regular-season play." 
</P>
<P>
The NFL is also expanding the regular season from 16 weeks to 17 next season, 
then to 18 after that. But each team will continue to play 16 games, getting 
one bye next season and two after that. 
</P>
<P>
The week off before the Super Bowl will be eliminated, at least next season, to 
absorb the extra week created by the 17-week season. ABC will televise the 
Super Bowl XXV on Jan. 27, 1991, from Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
ABC also will continue to televise four exhibition games each summer. 
</P>
<P>
ABC's main competitor for the Monday night package was the Fox network. "ABC 
had the right of first refusal on all bids for Monday night football," said 
Brad Turell, Fox senior vice president. "So, although we were an active 
participant in the NFL contract discussions, we are not surprised or dismayed 
by ABC re-signing the package." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Swanson, ABC Sports president, said: "Monday night football for 20 years 
has been a showcase for ABC. Its retention was our No. 1 priority." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, it was announced that Turner Broadcasting had made a deal with the 
NFL for Sunday night games in the first halves of the 1990-93 seasons. And 
Wednesday, it was announced that ESPN had acquired the rights to Sunday night 
games in the second halves of the same four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Combined, Turner and ESPN will pay $900 million over four years. 
</P>
<P>
Add ABC's estimated payments of $900 million to $1 billion, and the NFL has 
already piled up at least $1.8 billion in television revenue, with probable CBS 
and NBC packages still to come. 
</P>
<P>
CBS is expected to pay at least $1 billion for the NFC package and possibly two 
Super Bowls during the four years of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
NBC figures to pay about $700 million for the AFC package and one Super Bowl or 
at least $3.5 billion for four years. 
</P>
<P>
That breaks down to more than $30 million per team per year from television, up 
from the $17 million under the old contract. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, "Monday Night Football" averaged an 18.1 rating, 13th among 97 
prime-time shows.

IF THEY'RE GOING TO FIGHT, DO IT RIGHT

Sooner or later, hockey people will have to come to grips with the fact that 
repeated, concussive blows to the head can result in neurological impairment. 
If the violence gets any worse than it was Wednesday night at the Forum, the 
ban-boxing proponents will have a new target. 
</P>
<P>
On hockey's most combative night, the sport was shown to be the kind of 
activity where neurological exams should be required of all participants. 
</P>
<P>
In California, all professional boxers must pass a yearly neurological exam 
before they're issued a boxing license. And boxers get hit with gloved fists. 
Hockey players get hit with bare fists, elbows and, occasionally, sticks. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Simpson of Edmonton went down from seemingly every elbow thrown by the 
Kings Wednesday. If he were a licensed California boxer, he'd be on the 60-day 
suspended list today, forbidden even to spar. 
</P>
<P>
Also, National Hockey League referees and linesmen should be sent to clinics 
where real fight referees -- such as Richard Steele, Larry Rozadilla or Mills 
Lane -- can show them how to separate fighters in a clinch. NHL referees are 
hopeless at this. 
</P>
<P>
On second thought, boxing referees might be passing up some steady work here. 
If Mills Lane, who is about 5-feet-7 and 140 pounds, can separate, say, 
Bonecrusher Smith and Buster Douglas, he can surely pull apart a couple of 
exhausted hockey players, once he gets the skating part down. 
</P>
<P>
As for the skill level of the pugilism-on-ice Wednesday, we saw a mix of some 
surprisingly adept boxing and some very bad boxing. 
</P>
<P>
So, to beat even Ring magazine to the punch, here are the preliminary Times 
boxing ratings, ice hockey division: 
</P>
<P>
1. Petr Prajsler, Kings. 
</P>
<P>
2. Kelly Buchberger, Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
3. Jeff Beukeboom, Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
4. Dave Taylor, Kings. 
</P>
<P>
5. Mark Messier, Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
Comments: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Prajsler gets the top spot, despite a suspect chin, on the strength of 
landing two main-event right hands. Prajsler, you suspect, has watched Rocky 
Marciano fight films -- he loves coming straight down on top of a crouching 
opponent's head. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Buchberger makes the top five on instincts alone. Simply put, he loves to 
fight. If you're a boxing trainer, you take a long look at this guy. He's 
excellent inside, particularly at holding and hitting. You can get away with 
that in the pros. He needs work on defending against counters but has a good 
short left hook to the liver. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Beukeboom is what is called in the fight game "a good finisher." Like 
Carlos Ortiz, once Beukeboom gets his man in trouble, he never lets him off the 
hook. He has a first-rate sneak right hand. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Taylor is a solid fighter, mainly because he understands that the left jab 
is boxing's simplest, most effective punch. Does anyone want to back up a 
wildly swinging, out-of-control hockey player? He should watch Taylor, who 
understands that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. 
He has a good, quick elbow, too. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Messier showed probably the best patience Wednesday night. He doesn't 
rattle under fire, goes into a clinch when in trouble, fights well inside and 
slips punches very well. Generally, he displayed impressive ice generalship. 
</P>
<P>
A word about the Kings' bench: Trainer Peter Demers seemed slow to react all 
night and didn't appear to have any Enswell -- a frozen, contoured piece of 
stainless steel used to reduce swelling between rounds. And like Mike Tyson's 
corner in Tokyo, he didn't appear to have any ice. Oops, scratch that. There 
was plenty of ice. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton's Esa Tikkanen nearly made the list for aggressiveness alone, but he 
launches so many cheap shots that even a pro boxing referee might disqualify 
him. 
</P>
<P>
The same goes for Oiler Steve Smith. Once Wednesday, he punched a referee on 
the arm. This is not a guy you're going to see in a main event at the Mirage 
Hotel. However, Smith does own a good right uppercut, particularly effective 
against hockey players, who tend to come at you with their heads down. 
</P>
<P>
The worst pugilist was the Kings' Bob Halkidis. His plodding, 
leading-with-his-chin style reminds one of an old, eminently unsuccessful 1960s 
heavyweight, George (Washer Woman) Chuvalo. 
</P>
<P>
And someone needs to teach the Kings' Brian Benning to keep his feet on the ice 
when he throws a punch. He's strictly an arm puncher. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Marty McSorley of the Kings is not alert defensively -- he was tagged 
all night with sucker punches. 
</P>
<P>
Summing up, Angelo Dundee's heart rate would not have been raised by anything 
that occurred Wednesday. Or, not to worry, Buster.

HUMAN BILLBOARDS RUN IN MARATHON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Try to think of Sunday's Los Angeles Marathon less as a "happening," which it 
surely is; or a world-class athletic event, which it may become but is not now. 
</P>
<P>
Look at it more as a moving advertising opportunity, human billboards running 
26.2 miles through the city on live television. 
</P>
<P>
With that kind of exposure to a potential 12 million Southern Californians, 
it's no wonder that in only five years the L. A. Marathon has become the 
best-marketed, slickest, most modern and sponsor-driven of the world's major 
marathons. It may not be an overstatement that the L. A. Marathon is one of the 
country's best-marketed sports events of any kind. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on your point of view, this may or may not be good news. Massive 
marketing campaigns and major sponsors lining up for a seat on the money wagon 
do not make L. A. an elite race, give it prestige or attract the world's best 
runners. However, they do generate a tremendous amount of money for all 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
And that may yet transform this race, if -- as marathon President Bill Burke 
said this week -- the total purse of $202,520 is increased by $100,000 next 
year and significantly more money is added for appearance fees to lure top 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
The lineup of commercial support is impressive. The race has Mercedes-Benz of 
North America as its presenting sponsor, making it one of 10 companies that 
have not only paid the race organizers to be called sponsors, but have also put 
more money into the race either outright or by providing products and services. 
Mercedes provides automobiles for the top male and female finishers. 
</P>
<P>
The Times is one of the race's more generous sponsors. According to Will Kern, 
director of Times special events, this year's marathon has received almost 
$500,000 worth of donated advertising space. 
</P>
<P>
For this, the newspaper has received more than $50,000 in contributions to the 
Times Fund charity, Kern said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the marathon sells its name to licensees and suppliers, who donate 
everything from fruit and water to the official salted snack and the official 
hair-growth product. 
</P>
<P>
The race's marketing-oriented philosophy can be traced to Burke and marathon 
Vice President Marie Patrick. 
</P>
<P>
"It was because of our backgrounds in business," said Patrick, who came to the 
marathon from sports marketing in tennis. "We're not runners, never have been. 
We knew that you have to have big dollars in the beginning. From there you can 
move forward to be a major event." 
</P>
<P>
Burke and Patrick have formed a persuasive and successful recruiting team. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mary Reiling, national event manager for AT&amp;T, the L.A. 
Marathon's "sponsor-friendly" approach is a big incentive. 
</P>
<P>
"I've worked a lot of events with a lot of different promoters, but they are by 
far the most creative group I've ever seen," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mercedes-Benz, which also sponsors marathons in New York and San Francisco, 
likes the fact that the race gives them a foothold in their No. 1 market. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole marketing approach of Bill Burke is great for sponsors," said Linda 
Paulmeno, manager of press relations for Mercedes-Benz. "The whole race is very 
marketing-oriented." 
</P>
<P>
The race depends on sponsors for the bulk of its operating budget, which 
supports a year-round full-time staff. Patrick said the cost to sponsors varies 
from "the mid-six-figure range to over $1 million." The fees depend on the 
services and products offered by a firm. Trade-outs are common. 
</P>
<P>
The marathon receives several hundred thousand dollars from KCOP (Channel 13) 
for the television rights, and the race has also been sold to cable and will be 
covered by radio. The sponsors also work together for mutual benefit. For 
example, AT&amp;T is buying commercial time on Channel 13's broadcast, and 
Channel 13 is providing updates on the AT&amp;T Friendship Cup, an 
international race within the race. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, television makes the race more attractive to sponsors, who figure to 
multiply their exposure. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Lipeles, president of PacifiCare Health Systems, said sponsorship in 
the race helps separate his company in a congested health-care market. Also, 
the company provides headbands to all runners. "Certainly, we'd love it if 
every runner wore our headband during the race," he said.

ONE DOWN, OAKLAND, L.A. TO GO IN RAIDER MOVE SAGA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few months ago, Gregg Lukenbill, chief promoter of the bid to entice the 
Raiders to Sacramento, was saying that owner Al Davis was not that difficult to 
deal with, that he was misunderstood by critics. 
</P>
<P>
Lukenbill has joined the critics. 
</P>
<P>
Two days before the Sacramento City Council's Wednesday midnight deadline for 
Davis to agree to an offer of municipal payments of $50 million to move to the 
state capital, Lukenbill told the Sacramento Bee: "I think he's just basically 
blowing us off. It's hard for me to believe that, but that's what it seems to 
me. 
</P>
<P>
"God knows, we've given it our best shot. If what we've got isn't good enough, 
there's no point continuing the dialogue, because this deal isn't going to be 
any better two weeks or two years from now." 
</P>
<P>
Days before, Lukenbill already seemed to recognize that the Sacramento bid was 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 12, Lukenbill told a Times reporter that Davis has become so suspicious 
of offers, apparently feeling he repeatedly has been misled by promoters and 
politicians elsewhere, that he no longer can recognize "a good offer when he 
sees one. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder whether he is capable of coming to an affirmative decision," 
Lukenbill said. "His own indecisiveness is dragging this out." 
</P>
<P>
Lukenbill insisted Sacramento's offer was better than those of Oakland and Los 
Angeles, even though there might not have been as much money in it for the 
Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
He said that was because debts incurred by Oakland and Los Angeles in making 
good on their offers would require high ticket prices that would alienate fans. 
</P>
<P>
"In Oakland, wait until the fans see it's going to cost several hundred 
dollars, at least, to buy tickets," he said. "The team would be very unpopular 
two years after going there." 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, he said, luxury boxes and club seats would, comparatively, be 
held down and ticket prices would be far more reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
But, Lukenbill added, he recognized Davis had trouble moving from Los Angeles 
to Sacramento, a growing but medium-sized city. 
</P>
<P>
"We have what he wants, but we're in the wrong market for it," Lukenbill said. 
</P>
<P>
As negotiations dragged on, Lukenbill said, communications between him and 
Davis became increasingly difficult. Months before, Lukenbill indicated one 
serious issue in dispute was a demand by he and his partners for a share in the 
ownership of the Raiders to help guarantee that the franchise would remain in 
Sacramento. In the February conversation, Lukenbill did not mention that but 
said in general he had problems talking to Davis. Lukenbill added that no 
matter how hard he and his partners tried to improve matters, understanding and 
rapport with Davis deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
Those feelings apparently were picked up by Sacramento residents. By the time 
the City Council met Tuesday night to formally reject an extension of its bid, 
there seemed to be very few citizens who cared. 
</P>
<P>
Lukenbill didn't bother to attend. 
</P>
<P>
A half-hearted attempt by City Treasurer Tom Friery to keep the deal alive was 
quickly rejected by Council members. 
</P>
<P>
The next move in the saga of where the Raiders will play is expected March 12 
in Oakland, when the Oakland City Council and the Alameda County Board of 
Supervisors meet to consider approval of a $660-million offer to Davis. 
</P>
<P>
One step toward approval came this week when authorities finished negotiating a 
contract revision with the Oakland Athletics' baseball franchise. The A's will 
accept stadium expansion in exchange for $500,000 more from the sale of luxury 
boxes, a larger share of parking and concessions revenues and the right to 
leave in 1996 if they decide they don't like sharing the Oakland-Alameda County 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
There was bad news, however. The San Francisco 49ers claim they are due 
compensation if the Raiders return to Oakland in a "territorial re-invasion" 
that could be competitively detrimental to the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of what happens in Oakland, however, the odds may slowly be shifting 
Los Angeles' way in the bidding to claim the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between the Los Angeles Coliseum's private managers, Spectacor 
Management Group and MCA, Inc., and Davis, were said Thursday to have reached a 
delicate stage, but to have promising elements. 
</P>
<P>
Neither side would discuss the situation publicly, but Coliseum Commissioner 
Richard Riordan said: "I'm more optimistic. . . . The basic question is where 
can you sell (luxury) boxes for $100,000 a year, except in L.A?" 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles offer includes building 200 luxury boxes and thousands of club 
seats either in a reconstructed or renovated Coliseum, depending on which is 
most satisfactory to both parties. 
</P>
<P>
It also contains at least $70 million in franchise fees and other guarantees, a 
figure that may be low, but one which apparently doesn't match Oakland's in 
committed dollars. As Riordan indicated, the Los Angeles pitch is that Davis 
can make more money here than in the Bay Area, even if the advance guarantees 
are smaller. 
</P>
<P>
Many people who have dealt with Davis on behalf of Los Angeles or suburban 
Irwindale, when that project was still alive, say they have the impression that 
Davis would prefer to stay in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, Oakland, like Sacramento, may be something of a sideshow, kept 
going by Davis to keep the Los Angeles negotiators worried enough to make a 
high bid. 
</P>
<P>
If that is the case, it should become evident after Oakland has completed the 
formalities of approving its offer. Just as Lukenbill and Sacramento residents 
gradually perceived, Davis wasn't really going to be coming north.

A man identified as New Jersey Net forward Charles Shackleford was arrested in 
Orange, N.J., on a charge of possession of a small amount of marijuana, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Shackleford, who has been a focal point of an alleged point-shaving scheme at 
North Carolina State, was taken to the Orange Police Department headquarters 
and released after he posted bail. 
</P>
<P>
ABC News, citing unidentified sources, reported Wednesday that Shackleford was 
being investigated for point-shaving during the 1987-88 season. 
</P>
<P>
Shackleford has missed the last two games with an infected elbow and did not 
accompany the team on a recent trip. He was scheduled to return to the lineup 
Saturday against the Atlanta Hawks.

Michigan running back Leroy Hoard, most valuable player of the 1989 Rose Bowl 
game, will forfeit his final year of eligibility and make himself eligible for 
the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of my decision had nothing to do with money," Hoard said Thursday. "I 
always wanted a chance to play in the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
The NFL recently announced that it will accept juniors in the draft April 
22-23. 
</P>
<P>
Hoard gained 142 yards and scored two touchdowns as the Rose Bowl MVP in 1989 
when Michigan beat USC, 22-14. He gained 108 yards in last January's Rose Bowl 
game, which USC won, 17-10.

AT THE GALLERIES: 'SEVEN SCULPTORS' OFFERS ENGAGING SAMPLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEAH OLLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In David Engbritson's "Cone," part of the "Seven Sculptors" exhibition at UC 
San Diego's Mandeville Gallery, an opening roughly the size of a human head 
hangs at eye level, beckoning our gaze within. What we see when we peer through 
the wood slat construction is a charred interior -- at odds with the gold 
painted exterior -- and a small segment of the gallery floor, visible through 
the cone's open point. 
</P>
<P>
Silhouetted against this patch of floor are two small spiders that have taken 
up residence in the artwork. Their presence there, however unintentional, 
nevertheless satisfies a desire, shared by most of the sculptors here, for 
their work to be encountered in real space. No pedestals here; the work either 
stands freely on the floor or hangs from the wall or ceiling. These artists 
dissolve the distanced, protected realm of traditional sculpture and situate 
their work within our casual grasp. 
</P>
<P>
Sculpture now, more often than not, exists in the same physical and 
psychological domain we inhabit daily. It aims to expand that realm, to stretch 
its boundaries to embrace metaphor, magic, mystery and memory. Of the seven 
artists in this show -- an annual, invitational exhibition featuring emerging 
and mid-career artists -- most do enrich that space. They fill it with curious 
visual presences and catalysts of the imagination. Together they present an 
engaging sample of sculptural possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
The show's only disappointments come in the form of technical theatrics that 
aspire to no real meaning, as in the case of Carol Hepper, or that aspire to 
more meaning than they deliver, as in Yolande McKay's work. Thick bunches of 
bent willow twigs spew out of the curved metal pipe joints in Hepper's work, 
stretching and twisting to make the next turn. Though physically commanding, 
the work's dialogue between the organic and the artificial stops just past the 
point of introductions, leaving little for the viewer to mull over. 
</P>
<P>
McKay's weighty concrete forms have the imposing but ultimately powerless 
presence of blind authority. Each contains a clear glass window allowing a view 
of its interior, empty but for the interesting tones and textures of the walls. 
McKay alludes to a more pointed purpose in her work and to the threat of 
danger, but she never follows through. 
</P>
<P>
Slighter in substance but far more enveloping sensually and intellectually are 
Wade Saunders' small bronze "Water Drawings." Part of a much larger series, 
these 15 objects grouped on the floor resemble tools, musical instruments, 
internal organs, plant forms, all of which are capable of being vessels or 
channels for fluids. A tight cluster of pod-like forms, a curved pipe, a wheel 
with knobby spokes -- each bears the imprint of the human hand, having first 
been molded in wax, then cast in bronze. 
</P>
<P>
Their gray, smoky surfaces and irregular, hand-wrought textures assert an 
affinity with the Earth, and they sit here as if freshly emerged, evidence of 
an earlier, simpler era. Tangible sketches of another time, they soak in the 
aura of history and human use. Shades of whimsy and mystery also graze across 
the work, giving it a refreshing breadth of interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
Works by both Zizi Raymond and Michael Peed reach backward, too, into a 
personal past laced with both nostalgia and tension. Both artists also defy 
expectations of their materials. 
</P>
<P>
In one of Raymond's witty constructions, a stream of steel wool pours from an 
old-fashioned milk bottle into a limp heap on the floor. The bottle rests on 
its side on a wooden table that has been sliced in half and mounted high on the 
gallery wall. The proverbial spilled milk elicits no tears here, only a cry of 
surprise at the disjunctive play of materials. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond's "Secrets" has richer narrative potential as well as several of the 
same challenges to gravity, stability and logic. Here, half of a short ladder 
leans into empty space, its forward pull offset by a metal case a few feet 
away, to which it is attached by string. The case, closed with a padlock, sits, 
tilted, on a rolling pin. Ladder, case, rolling pin and string are all painted 
black, which shifts their significance from the functional to the metaphoric. 
Atop the ladder rest two clear glass jars, each holding a little girl's black 
patent leather shoe. The shoes are preserved, relics, perhaps, of a thwarted 
journey toward maturity. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Peed's works also address memories of youth, but in a more lighthearted, 
sentimental manner. In one scene, father and daughter drive through the "Garden 
of the Gods," Dad wide-eyed and gesturing broadly, the daughter holding the car 
door with a tentative hand and glancing at the spectacles outside with equally 
reticent eyes. In "Merle's House," two boys peer into the bedroom window of a 
young man who has just stripped to his underwear to pose before the mirror, 
flexing his nonexistent muscles. 
</P>
<P>
The cartoon-like quality of these subjects is matched by their simplified 
forms, carved out of wood in low relief, then painted or varnished. The works 
address the viewer as paintings, rectangular windows on the world, but they 
also possess a weight and physicality exclusive to sculpture. The 
sophistication of Peed's dialogue with technique jars with his childlike, 
cliched images, yielding a style that is clever and catchy. 
</P>
<P>
Creighton Michael and David Engbritson refer to organic forms and geometric 
shapes in their work, but both remain purposefully vague. They invite our 
musings on the notion of gravity and challenge our expectations of materials, 
making the solid fluid and the common precious. Together with the other artists 
in the show, which continues through March 25, they spread a varied and often 
tantalizing feast of sculptural possibilities.

Elvis impersonator Raymond Michael could teach the King a thing or two about 
balancing life styles. Since 1978, the 36-year-old entertainer and his band, 
The American Legends of Rock 'N' Roll, have performed all over the world in 
tributes to Presley. Yet during the week, Mr. Hebel, as he is known to his 
students, teaches sixth grade and chorus at Chaparral Middle School in 
Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
Tomorrow night, Hebel will again bring his show to where it all began when he 
performs a benefit concert at his alma mater, California Lutheran University in 
Thousand Oaks. For this year's appearance, Hebel will add 16 musicians 
including a horn section, and several backup singers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm doing a tribute to him. I'm not trying to be him," said Hebel, who 
performed as Elvis for about five years before the King's death. He prefers the 
term illusionist. 
</P>
<P>
Hebel has performed in Canada, Guam, Japan, Australia and the South Pacific. 
"It is one of the most popular shows we've had at the park," said Robert Deuel, 
a publicist at Knott's Berry Farm. 
</P>
<P>
Trained as a lyric baritone, Raymond Michael Hebel was a music student at Cal 
Lutheran. In the fall of 1972, he represented the football team on a panel of 
student guinea pigs for a hypnotist who was entertaining the student body. 
Until then, his knowledge of Presley songs was limited to "Blue Suede Shoes," 
which his roommate sang constantly. 
</P>
<P>
Hebel said he remembers nothing of what happened after the hypnotist suggested 
he portray Elvis -- he brought the house down in a performance of "Blue Suede 
Shoes." 
</P>
<P>
At the urging of friends and professors, Hebel said he turned down offers of 
singing jobs with opera companies to perfect his Elvis show. 
</P>
<P>
People are always amazed at the difference between Hebel's alter ego and the 
tall, polite, soft-spoken person they meet before a performance. He can remove 
the wig and sideburns and disappear. 
</P>
<P>
"When I fly to appearances, the people at the airport end up paging me because 
I look so different from their expectations," Hebel said with a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
He delights in his normalcy, his 2-year-old son and his wife, Donna. After his 
marriage in 1984, Hebel wanted what he calls "a respectable life." He holds a 
kindergarten through 12th grade music and multi-subject teaching credential. 
After substitute teaching for 11 years while doing Elvis, Hebel during the last 
four years has taught full time at Chaparral, where he and "Elvis" have been 
responsible for building the chorus to 250 students. 
</P>
<P>
"Once I did a stint at the Silverbird in Las Vegas, and the next day I was 
teaching a special education class. That really brings your feet to the 
ground," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Michael and his band, "The American Legends of Rock 'N' Roll," will 
present "A Tribute to Elvis" at the California Lutheran University Auditorium, 
Thousand Oaks, at 8 p.m. Saturday. Tickets are $10 in advance ($15 at the 
door), $5 children 16 and under. For information, call (805) 493-3170. ROBYN

Two Vietnamese soldiers who defected to Cambodian guerrilla forces said at 
least 300 Vietnamese troops are fighting alongside Cambodian government forces 
in the northwest of the country. Hanoi, which installed the Cambodian 
government in 1979, claims it pulled out its last troops last September.

Luis Alberto Lacalle became president of Uruguay and promised to revive its 
sagging economy. Uruguay, located between inflation-ravaged Argentina and 
Brazil, has grown visibly poorer in the past decade. As Lacalle, a 48-year-old 
lawyer, took the oath of office, jubilant supporters crowded the streets of 
Montevideo to hail the country's first president from the Blanco Party.

Cleanup crews mopped up 30,000 gallons of heavy oil that leaked from a damaged 
tank on a barge at an Exxon terminal, briefly closing the main entrance to New 
Jersey's chief port area, and a second but much smaller spill occurred nearby. 
Coast Guard officials in New York said they had reopened the Kill Van Kull 
waterway, between Staten Island, N.Y., and New Jersey, after Wednesday's spill. 
In the later spill, more than 500 gallons of heavy crude oil spilled from a 
Texaco barge into the Arthur Kill waterway off the Exxon Bayway refinery in 
Bayonne, N.J.

A District of Columbia judge released his legal hold over Dr. Elizabeth 
Morgan's passport, bringing her closer to a reunion in New Zealand with the 
7-year-old daughter she spirited into hiding more than two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The District of Columbia Court of Appeals is expected to agree with the ruling. 
Morgan spent more than two years in jail for refusing to produce her daughter, 
Hilary, for unsupervised visits with her ex-husband, Dr. Eric A. Foretich, whom 
she accused of sexually molesting the child. Foretich is already in New Zealand 
seeking authorization to visit Hilary.

On a 78-19 vote, the Senate approved a $125-million program of grants to 
encourage volunteer work. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would earmark $25 million for school-based programs involving 
teacher aides, tutoring and the teaching of reading. It also would provide $35 
million for a youth service corps, involving park and forest cleanup programs 
for volunteers 16 to 25 years old. A program for individuals 17 and older would 
focus on service in education, the environment, public safety and other fields, 
and would be cleared to receive $25 million.

BACKERS OF ETHICS PACKAGE LOSE FIGHT ON BALLOT LETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Supporters of the Los Angeles City Council's ethics-and-pay-raise package 
failed Thursday in a behind-the-scenes attempt to gain control of the writing 
of the opposition argument that is to be placed on the June ballot along with 
the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The maneuver prompted a bitter complaint from Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, a foe 
of the package, who said its proponents were trying to sabotage the opposition 
"with rank, gutter political maneuvering." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky told reporters that a council member who opposed the package ought 
to write the opposition argument. Instead, backers of the package had enlisted 
Councilman Gilbert Lindsay, who voted for it, to nominate himself to write the 
opposition language, Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
The maneuver was abandoned Thursday when Council President John Ferraro 
selected Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, an opponent of the package, to draw up the 
opposition statement. 
</P>
<P>
According to a source involved in the matter, it was Ferraro who had asked 
Lindsay's staff to write a letter requesting that Lindsay be appointed for the 
task. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Gay, Lindsay's chief deputy, confirmed Thursday that he had been asked by 
another council member to write the letter. Gay declined to say who made the 
request. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay, 89, has suffered a stroke, is in poor health and is not up to the 
task, Yaroslavsky said. Had Lindsay gotten the assignment, the outcome would 
have been a weak opposition argument controlled by supporters of the package. 
</P>
<P>
The measure approved Wednesday would establish public financing of political 
campaigns, ban outside jobs and honorariums for elected officials, restrict 
gifts they may receive and bar them from lobbying for one year after they leave 
office. 
</P>
<P>
The ballot statements, 300- to 500-word explanations, are "pivotal" and will be 
the opponents' "only vehicle to communicate with the voters," said Yaroslavsky, 
who voted against the package Wednesday along with Councilman Ernani Bernardi. 
Galanter did not vote. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky called the tactic "unethical" and said backers of the package 
attempted it "out of fear that a coherent argument would be written against 
this Charter amendment." 
</P>
<P>
"People who are duly qualified and have opposed the measure out of conviction 
and not out of manipulation should have the opportunity to write that 
argument," Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Lindsay in all likelihood would not have been capable of writing an 
argument in the time allotted." 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro denied any role in the matter and said all he knew was that he had 
received a letter signed by Lindsay requesting that he be permitted to write 
the opposition statement. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said: "It's a sad situation and it's having an impact on public 
policy. . . . Gil has been physically incapacitated since his stroke. He is not 
the same Gil he was before." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Thursday, Lindsay said he did not want to write the opposition 
statement. When asked about the letter that Ferraro had received from him, 
Lindsay responded, "I guess I changed my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Told of Yaroslavsky's comments about his health, Lindsay said: "How would he 
know what my capabilities are? I've been doing pretty well all these years." 
Lindsay has served on the council for 27 years.

BILL BOYARSKY: L.A. CREWS STANDING BY FOR BIG ONE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Building inspectors rank high among the most-hated occupations, right up there 
with reporters, lawyers and car dealers. 
</P>
<P>
They're a grating part of the bureaucracy, enforcers who bring government 
regulation directly into the home. No faceless bureaucrat, the building 
inspector personally delivers the bad news that the walls of your new addition 
don't meet standards. 
</P>
<P>
But Wednesday afternoon, I got a different picture. "Find the bureaucrat in 
charge of earthquakes," an editor told me about an hour after the quake. I knew 
what he had in mind. It was something we've talked about here at the paper. 
Many unknown people -- bureaucrats -- make the cities, and county, work even in 
times of calamity. But we never write about them unless they screw up. This was 
a chance to tell another side. 
</P>
<P>
There is no one earthquake czar, it turns out. In the 85 cities in Los Angeles 
County, and in the county government itself, law enforcement officers, 
firefighters, and others share the responsibility for managing things in a vast 
but fragile metropolis built on a network of active faults. 
</P>
<P>
The building and safety inspectors and engineers are some of the most important 
earthquake bureaucrats. As soon as the shaking stops, they check government 
buildings to see whether the police and fire dispatchers and all the other 
implementers of disaster plans must be shifted to emergency quarters. In 
Pomona, just after the quake, inspectors examined shattered windows, stairwells 
and fire escapes, and closed the damaged City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
If the quake is bad, the engineers and inspectors fan out into the 
neighborhoods and check the houses and businesses. When residents were ordered 
to remain out of their houses and apartments in San Francisco's Marina District 
last October, it was the building inspectors who did it. 
</P>
<P>
I took the elevator up to the ninth floor of Los Angeles City Hall to the 
executive offices of the Department of Building and Safety, the building 
inspection agency. By then it was 5 p.m., and it was clear this had not been 
The Big One. With the exception of a few people, the office was empty. 
</P>
<P>
I found two of the earthquake bureaucrats in a back office -- Earl Schwartz, 
the department's executive officer, and Tim Taylor, chief of the building 
bureau, in charge of inspecting commercial buildings. Taylor, alerted I was 
coming, had put on a white hard hat for his earthquake interview. Building 
inspector humor. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor wore a blue blazer, not your tailored Armani but something sturdy enough 
enough for an inspection tour through an old downtown warehouse. Schwartz was 
dressed in a serviceable, wash-and-wear, short-sleeved dress shirt and slacks. 
</P>
<P>
When the quake hit, both were in the office suite. Schwartz turned on the 
radio. Reports from listeners who call KFWB and KNX, the news stations, from 
around the basin are the first indication of the extent of damage. Damage 
seemed light or nonexistent, a finding that was confirmed by telephone calls to 
branch building and safety offices in West Los Angeles and the San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"Within five or eight minutes, we knew we wouldn't have to activate our 
emergency plan," said Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
If the telephone system had failed, they'd have been worried. Schwartz, who's 
been with the department 34 years, and Taylor, a 26-year Building and Safety 
man, recall the Sylmar earthquake of 1971, when communications from the Valley 
were cut off and downtown didn't immediately know the extent of the disaster. 
Wednesday, everything was fine. 
</P>
<P>
I could see I was outstaying my welcome. When I left, Taylor was on the phone, 
talking to someone about construction of a new animal kennel at LAX. He wasn't 
hassling her, just trying to get a kennel properly built. 
</P>
<P>
If I were still a reporter writing news stories, I'd have called in and said 
"no story here." Action makes stories, and there wasn't any in Building and 
Safety on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But actually, I'd seen something worthwhile. I'd been reminded of the 
importance -- the presence, really -- of people like Taylor and Schwartz, and 
thousands more like them. They'd been on the job, shifted into action and were 
ready for the worst when the quake hit. That all went well kept them out of the 
news Wednesday, but they are used to that.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FOUR PLEAD NO CONTEST IN 'SKINHEAD' ASSAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four people accused of making racial slurs and assaulting an Iranian couple 
last May in a La Verne supermarket parking lot have pleaded no contest in 
Pomona Superior Court. Police said the four looked like "skinheads" and were 
carrying "white power" cards. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Robert Zaal, 25, of Glendora was sentenced to a year in County Jail and 
three years' probation and Scott Robert Wilson, 28, of West Covina received 180 
days in jail and three years' probation after each pleaded to a charge of 
felony assault. 
</P>
<P>
William Killackey, 21, of Covina was sentenced to 120 days in jail and two 
years' probation after pleading to a misdemeanor battery charge. His sister, 
Amy, 19, of Yorba Linda was sentenced to 34 days in jail and two years' 
probation on the same charge. 
</P>
<P>
The victims testified that they were walking to their car when the defendants 
followed them, and, apparently thinking they were Jewish, made anti-Semitic 
remarks and fought with them.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CHARGES FILED OVER AERIAL SPRAYING IN 
PASADENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Helicopter pilot Jim Josephson and San Joaquin Helicopters Inc. face 
misdemeanor charges stemming from the aerial spraying of malathion over 
Pasadena last week. 
</P>
<P>
Josephson, 49, lead pilot for the Feb. 22 spraying involving six helicopters 
from El Monte Airport, was charged Thursday with violating a new Pasadena 
ordinance that bans low-altitude formation flying at night. The Pasadena Board 
of Directors passed the ordinance Feb. 20 to stop Mediterranean fruit fly 
eradication efforts over their city. 
</P>
<P>
The charges against Josephson and his Delano-based company were filed in 
Pasadena Municipal Court. The pilot, who must appear for arraignment March 22, 
faces a maximum fine of $500 and six months in jail. His company could be fined 
an additional $500.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PROPOSED METRO RAIL ASSESSMENTS CUT IN HALF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Bradley on Thursday announced a reduction of nearly 50% in the proposed 
assessments to be levied against commercial property owners to pay for the 
Metro Rail line from mid-Wilshire to North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"The reduction of the assessment will enable more property owners to more 
easily contribute their fair share," Bradley said in announcing the reduction, 
which applies to property owners in close proximity to 11 planned stations 
along the 13.3-mile stretch. 
</P>
<P>
The original assessment, set at 33 to 55 cents per square foot, will now cost 
15 to 34 cents, Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
"I commend the community groups, the county and the RTD for coming together in 
an action that will ultimately benefit property owners and the residents of 
this city," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The assessments, to be paid in 29 annual installments, will enable the RTD to 
issue about $75 million in construction bonds over a seven-year period starting 
in 1993.

Students protesting the first day of an anti-gang dress code clashed with 
school officials and sheriff's deputies in the Antelope Valley on Thursday, 
boycotting classes and attacking a patrol car, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Two students were arrested and two others were being sought. 
</P>
<P>
The uproar coincided with similar protests on Los Angeles' West Side. 
</P>
<P>
In the Antelope Valley, students were angered by a ban on all but official 
school baseball caps and by wide-ranging authorization of school officials to 
prohibit any clothing regarded as gang-oriented. 
</P>
<P>
At Antelope Valley High School in Lancaster, a crowd of about 200 student 
demonstrators who had boycotted classes rushed a sheriff's sergeant who had 
detained four young men off campus, pelting his car with rocks and debris and 
chanting "Let them go," deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
The sergeant was questioning four adult gang members who had nothing to do with 
the demonstration, Sgt. Ron Shreves said. 
</P>
<P>
A 16-year-old boy described as a leader of the demonstrators was arrested, 
Shreves said. 
</P>
<P>
At Palmdale High School, an estimated 200 students staged a peaceful but noisy 
walkout for three hours. 
</P>
<P>
But at Quartz Hill High School, a 16-year-old boy was arrested for threatening 
a teacher when school administrators began seizing banned baseball caps from 
students, Deputy Gil Arce said. 
</P>
<P>
Assault and other charges will be filed against the two arrested students, and 
two others were being sought, Shreves said. 
</P>
<P>
The protests reflected widespread student discontent with the dress code 
adopted last month by trustees of the Antelope Valley Union High School 
District. School officials began enforcing the code Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
On Los Angeles' West Side, about 75 University High School students staged a 
similar protest Thursday, gathering on the school grounds and chanting "Hats, 
hats, hats" on the first day of a ban on headgear as "distracting" and symbolic 
of street gangs. 
</P>
<P>
The hat ban at University High School was the first controversial decision of 
the school's newly formed "shared decision-making council" composed of the 
principal, teachers, parents and community members.

TEACHER'S AIDE LINKED TO STEROID SALES FIRED

A Carlsbad teacher's aide will lose his job, even though criminal charges of 
selling steroids to students were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
The Carlsbad Union High School District's board of trustees agreed in closed 
session Wednesday night to fire the suspended aide, Gregory Tirona. 
</P>
<P>
Tirona's suspension will be continued, however, for 30 days. During that time, 
he may appeal the decision to the personnel commission, which would then hold a 
termination hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Tirona had been accused of selling steroids to three students from October to 
December, 1988, after the mother of one of the students found steroids in her 
son's possession and alerted school officials. The charges were dismissed after 
a trial jury deadlocked, 11 to 1 for acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
"The action of the board was that they extended the suspension to give him 
notice that he will be dismissed at the end of 30 days," Supt. Thomas Brierly 
said after the session. 
</P>
<P>
The school board had to act within 10 days of the end of Tirona's trial, and 
had two options, school district counsel Dick Hamilton said before the closed 
session. The other option was to lift Tirona's suspension. 
</P>
<P>
A termination hearing through the personnel commission, Hamilton said, is 
significantly different from a trial by jury. 
</P>
<P>
"In the criminal process, the burden of proof is 'beyond a reasonable doubt,' " 
Hamilton said. A job hearing requires only that the majority of the evidence be 
against Tirona. In addition, hearsay evidence is allowed at job hearings, but 
not at trials, he said. 
</P>
<P>
School board members said they could not comment on the Tirona case because it 
is a confidential personnel matter, but last week board member Ed Switzer said 
that a personnel commission hearing would be "the ideal situation" because it 
would allow the school to "consider all the facts." 
</P>
<P>
"As a board member, I think I have a strong obligation to protect kids, but, by 
the same token, I don't want to falsely accuse an employee," Switzer said. 
</P>
<P>
Tirona, who could not be reached for comment Thursday, had said after his trial 
that he would like to return to Carlsbad High School, where he had been a 
teacher's aide for four years.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE / ANTHONY PERRY: DOGIES, DIRT, HORSE ARE PROVIDED; BRING 
YOUR OWN GREENHORN FANTASY

<P>
Most mothers heed Willie Nelson's advice and don't raise their sons to be 
cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
This makes sound fiscal and anatomical sense (saddle sores can be hell). But it 
leaves an unfulfilled cultural yearning to participate in that Western rite of 
passage: the cattle drive. 
</P>
<P>
Into the breach steps Mike Klarfeld, 62, a Rancho Bernardo attorney and 
executive vice president of Cattle Drive America. 
</P>
<P>
He's convinced there is a desire among the populace to pay up to $450 a day to 
hop on a horse and be part of a weeklong cattle roundup and drive. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer Klarfeld went on a 40-mile drive from Big Hole Basin, Colo., to the 
rodeo at Cheyenne, Wyo. He's been talking about little else since. 
</P>
<P>
"When the boss yelled out, 'Head 'em up, move 'em out,' I got goose bumps all 
over," he said. "All that was missing was the theme song from 'Rawhide.' " 
</P>
<P>
Among Klarfeld's fellow fantasy cowpokes in driving the 475 steers were a 
military pilot, an optometrist, a car dealer, a Federal Express executive, 
insurance salesmen and several schoolteachers. 
</P>
<P>
A chuck wagon followed the drive. Tents were available for sleeping. At night, 
tall tales were swapped around the campfire, naturally. 
</P>
<P>
After the drive, Klarfeld became an officer of Cattle Drive America. Now he's 
taking reservations for several drives from mid-June to mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate interest is high -- there are discounts for groups -- and inquiries 
have come from Japan, the Netherlands and Germany. Klarfeld sees no trouble 
filling all the spots. 
</P>
<P>
And he's still aglow over what happened when he headed for a motel in Cheyenne 
-- grubby, dirty, smelly and dressed in chaps and spurs. 
</P>
<P>
"A woman looked at me and told her friend: 'Look there's a real cowboy,' " he 
said. "That made it all worth it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hands Off Does Fawns and Felines 
</P>
<P>
From here and there. 
</P>
<P>
* Hands off Bambi! 
</P>
<P>
A protest by animal rights' advocates is planned for this morning outside the 
State Building in downtown San Diego during a meeting of the California Fish 
and Game Commission. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Animal Advocates wants the commission to ban the hunting of does and 
fawns in San Diego County. So do the Board of Supervisors and the city's 
Wildlife Advisory Committee. 
</P>
<P>
But the commission staff says the monthlong hunt is needed to thin down the 
deer herd because of dwindling rangeland. 
</P>
<P>
* The La Mesa City Council has scratched plans to license cats. Too hard to 
enforce; too much opposition from cat lovers. 
</P>
<P>
* In "The Hunt for Red October," Sean Connery plays a Russian submarine skipper 
who wants to defect to the United States but first has to trick his own crew. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you get a crew to abandon a submarine?" he ponders. 
</P>
<P>
At a preview this week, a San Diego sailor shouted out a sure-fire solution: 
"Just let water start coming in." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Putting Cork on Alcohol Law 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Councilman John Hartley has an interesting attitude about alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
He was among those council members who at first voted to ban booze at all city 
beaches and parks. But he takes a different approach when his contributors and 
supporters who own liquor stores and groceries are involved. 
</P>
<P>
After receiving contributions from an East San Diego grocery owner, her cousin 
and the cousin's son, Hartley sought to help the owner get a rehearing on her 
rejected bid for a beer-and-wine license. 
</P>
<P>
Now he has voted against a proposal by the city manager to reduce the sale of 
cheap, fortified wines such as Thunderbird and Night Train in several 
middle-income residential neighborhoods east of California 163. 
</P>
<P>
Hartley's vote bottled up the proposal in committee. Judy McCarty and Wes Pratt 
voted in favor, but it takes three "yea" votes to advance to the full council. 
</P>
<P>
That probably will be accomplished at the next meeting. Ron Roberts, who was 
absent for the first vote, is also in favor.

BAJA OFFICER IS INDICTED IN S.D.; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: BRIBERY CHARGES ARE THE LATEST DEVELOPMENT IN THE COMPLEX INQUIRY INTO 
AN INS INSPECTOR'S SHOOTING DEATH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A federal grand jury in San Diego indicted a Baja California state police 
officer Thursday on charges of soliciting a $5,000 bribe from a San Diego-area 
resident who says he is an informer for the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment is the latest development in the increasingly complex 
investigation of the shooting death of a former U.S. immigration inspector, 
Jeffrey William Anderson, whose body was found south of Tijuana on Jan. 13. 
Anderson's wallet, containing cash and credit cards, was found nearby, leading 
police to dismiss robbery as a motive. 
</P>
<P>
The purported informer, Luis Roberto Estrella Solano, a Mexican national who 
lives in El Cajon, was sought for questioning by Mexican police in connection 
with the murder, although what knowledge he might have of the slaying remains 
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
Baja California's top state police official said Thursday that all five 
officers involved in the alleged bribe attempt have been dismissed from the 
force, including the agent indicted Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
An affidavit filed in federal court says Estrella was turned over to Mexican 
authorities Feb. 9 by two U.S. law enforcement officers: an unidentified 
immigration official and Ron Collins, a San Diego police officer who has long 
served as a liaison to Mexican police. Collins was out of town and unavailable 
for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Once turned over to the Mexican police, Estrella told investigators that he 
suffered six days of torture and intimidation. In a court affidavit, Estrella 
said that Mexican officials punched his body, kicked him in the groin and 
almost drowned him, apparently in an effort to make him talk about the murder. 
</P>
<P>
According to the federal affidavit, the Mexican police officers told Estrella 
that "he had better talk because the DEA was not there to protect him anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service in San Diego 
confirmed Thursday that they revoked the immigration status of Estrella on Feb. 
9 in response to a request from unspecified "other U.S. agencies," in the words 
of Rudy Murillo, INS spokesman in San Diego. That revocation opened the way for 
U.S. authorities to turn Estrella over to Mexican police that evening. 
</P>
<P>
Estrella had been admitted to the United States on Jan. 3 under a status known 
as "parole," which is often used for foreign nationals who are material 
witnesses in criminal cases. The INS spokesman indicated that Estrella was 
willing to return to Mexico in order to clear himself of any connection to the 
murder. (Estrella could not be reached for comment Thursday at his El Cajon 
residence.) 
</P>
<P>
James Mavromatis, a DEA spokesman, said Thursday in San Diego that he could 
neither confirm nor deny Estrella's assertion in court papers that he is an 
agency informer. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 14, the Mexican officers released Estrella and vowed not to file 
criminal charges against him in exchange for the anticipated bribe, according 
to Joan P. Weber, assistant U.S. attorney in San Diego. Estrella then returned 
to the United States, court papers say. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, U.S. officials said, FBI agents arrested a Mexican state police 
officer, Carlos Alberto Nunez Amador, when the officer entered the United 
States and attempted to collect the bribe from Estrella at the McDonald's 
restaurant in San Ysidro. 
</P>
<P>
FBI agents were posted at the restaurant and were observing the transaction, 
according to the affidavit, which was submitted by Rene F. Medina, an FBI agent 
in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Word of the case had immediate fallout in Baja California, where a reformist 
opposition governor, Ernesto Ruffo Appel, took office Nov. 1 and pledged to 
clean up corruption in police and other government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The five Baja police officers who reportedly tortured Estrella and solicited 
the bribe from him have all been dismissed, said Rafael Ladron de Guevara, 
director of the state judicial police there. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not tolerate this kind of activity," Ladron said by telephone from 
Mexicali, the state capital. 
</P>
<P>
As for the murder of Anderson, the former INS agent, Ladron would say only that 
the investigation is continuing. No arrests have been made, said Ladron, who 
declined to comment on a possible motive. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Mexican agents out of a job is Nunez Amador, 24, who was arrested by 
the FBI on Feb. 15 after he allegedly received the bribe money in an envelope 
from Estrella. Nunez Amador is charged with six extortion-related counts, each 
of which carries a maximum five-year prison sentence and a fine of $250,000. He 
has already pleaded not guilty to an earlier, related indictment. He is being 
held without bail at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Also dismissed were Armando Avila, chief of the state police substation in 
Rosarito, a community south of Tijuana; Genaro Valle, deputy chief of the 
substation, and two agents, Ricardo Estrada and Feliciano Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, the slain INS inspector, was a 24-year-old part-time employee of the 
service, posted at the Port of Entry at San Ysidro. He began working as an 
intern in July, 1988, and resigned last Nov. 1, citing personal reasons, said 
Murillo, the INS spokesman in San Diego. Anderson was described as affable and 
competent, although he had yet to undergo the extensive training required of a 
full-time inspector. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a nice kid; everyone liked him," Murillo said. "The one characteristic 
that keeps coming up is that he was very naive. . . . I sure hope he didn't get 
in over his head."

RAIL LINE PLAN SPEEDS TOWARD DECISION AFTER YEARS OF STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After years of indecision and seemingly endless study, the question of whether 
a mass transit line should be built in the San Fernando Valley is on the fast 
track. 
</P>
<P>
Within two weeks, the staff of the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission 
is to release its critically important projection of funds available to build 
the next rail line. 
</P>
<P>
And on March 28, the commission, which is building a countywide network of rail 
lines, is to determine if the next line -- the fourth and last to be built in 
this century -- should be the Valley plan or one of two proposed light-rail 
lines: one from downtown to Pasadena, the other a northward extension of the 
Century Freeway line under construction from El Segundo to Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
If the Valley route is selected, design work and land acquisition will take 
about five years, Neil Peterson, the commission executive director, said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Construction "could begin in 1995 and could be completed in 2001," the same 
year that the full downtown-to-North Hollywood Metro Rail subway is to be 
finished, he said. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the commission set the stage for a showdown vote in four weeks by 
voting 8 to 3 to select as the Valley's preferred route the little-used 
Southern Pacific railroad right of way that crosses the Valley from North 
Hollywood to Warner Center, roughly parallel to Chandler and Victory 
boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners also voted to place the line underground, in a subway, in 
residential areas of North Hollywood and Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
The configuration chosen by the commission paves the way for a proposal pushed 
by a coalition of Valley political, business and homeowner leaders to extend 
the downtown Metro Rail subway 5.6 miles west to the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
From there, express buses would carry passengers to high-employment areas, 
including Warner Center and the Chatsworth-Northridge industrial area. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which carries a $1.1-billion price tag and a daily ridership estimate 
of 41,000, would use all the commission's available funds during the 1990s, and 
might also require the sale of bonds to be paid off by sales tax receipts after 
the turn of the century, said state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana), who led 
efforts to form the coalition behind the Metro Rail extension plan. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, Valley residents could board a Metro Rail train at Victory 
Boulevard and the San Diego Freeway and travel all the way downtown without 
changing trains. 
</P>
<P>
At the 7th and Flower streets' station downtown, riders would be able to 
transfer to the Long Beach-Los Angeles light-rail line, which is to open July 
16. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach line also intersects the Norwalk-to-El Segundo Century Freeway 
line, which is scheduled for completion in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
In selecting the Chandler-Victory route for the Valley, commissioners halted 
study of two rival plans for the Valley -- a $1.8-billion elevated monorail 
along the Ventura Freeway from Universal City to Warner Center and a 
$1.1-billion plan for a light-rail line in a shallow trench along the 
Chandler-Victory route, from North Hollywood to Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
Both rival plans that the commission will consider March 28 would cost less 
than the Valley proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The 13.5-mile downtown-to-Pasadena line would cost about $925 million and would 
draw up to 68,000 passengers a day, according to a commission study. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed 5.3-mile extension of the Century Freeway line north from El 
Segundo, past Los Angeles International Airport to Marina del Rey, would cost 
$329 million and have a daily ridership of 14,000, staff planners say. 
</P>
<P>
A question lingering Thursday was what effect, if any, there would be from the 
results of a June 5 advisory vote in the Valley on rail options. 
</P>
<P>
The vote was engineered by County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who represents 
the bulk of the Valley. He had hoped that the results would bolster his nearly 
single-handed drive for a freeway monorail line. 
</P>
<P>
Dawson Oppenheimer, Antonovich's press deputy, said Thursday that the 
supervisor "remains committed to his plan and of course the June 5 vote will go 
forward." 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich said previously that any decision the commission makes "can be 
undone after the voters speak in June." 
</P>
<P>
Voters will be asked to endorse the Metro Rail extension plan or one of the two 
plans apparently killed by the commission on Wednesday -- Antonovich's monorail 
proposal and the plan for a light-rail line on the Chandler-Victory route from 
North Hollywood to Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
Voters also will be able to vote for no rail line. 
</P>
<P>
If the Valley line is selected on March 28, purchase of the right of way is not 
expected to be a problem, commission staff members say. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Pacific announced last year that it wanted to sell the 
Chandler-Victory right of way, which carries only about one freight train a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Last June, the commission authorized the staff to appraise the land as a first 
step to buying it.

STUDENTS, DEPUTIES CLASH OVER DRESS CODE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Antelope Valley high school students protesting the first day of an anti-gang 
dress code clashed with school officials and sheriff's deputies Thursday, 
boycotting classes and attacking a patrol car, deputies said. Two students were 
arrested, and two others were being sought. 
</P>
<P>
The students were angered by a ban on all but official school baseball caps and 
wide-ranging authorization for school officials to prohibit any clothing 
regarded as gang-oriented. 
</P>
<P>
Class boycotts at Palmdale High School and Antelope Valley High School in 
Lancaster drew about 200 students each. 
</P>
<P>
At Antelope Valley High, the demonstration led to an assault on 
</P>
<P>
the patrol car of a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 students rushed a sheriff's sergeant who had detained four men off 
campus about 11:20 a.m., pelting his car with rocks and debris and chanting 
"Let them go," deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
The sergeant was questioning four adult gang members who had nothing to do with 
the demonstration, Sgt. Ron Shreves said, but the demonstrators may have 
believed those being detained were fellow students. 
</P>
<P>
A 16-year-old boy described as a leader of the group was arrested and detained 
at Juvenile Hall in Sylmar, said Shreves. He and two other students will be 
charged with assault, Shreves said. 
</P>
<P>
School Principal Yvonne Healey said she could not confirm the Sheriff's 
Department's version of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
At Palmdale High School, about 200 students staged a peaceful but noisy walkout 
for three hours. Most returned to classes about 10:30 a.m. after deputies 
warned the protesters they could be arrested. No arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
But at Quartz Hill High School, a 16-year-old boy was arrested for threatening 
a teacher when school administrators began seizing banned baseball caps from 
students during a morning sweep of the campus, said Deputy Gil Arce. 
</P>
<P>
The protests reflected widespread student discontent with the controversial 
dress code adopted last month by the Board of Trustees of the Antelope Valley 
Union High School District. School officials began enforcing the code 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Students at the three main campuses, arguing that the policy unfairly infringes 
on their rights and will do little to halt gang violence, said they plan to 
protest again at Wednesday night's school board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
School officials said they did not expect further student class boycotts today. 
</P>
<P>
"People should be able to dress the way they want at a public high school," 
said Scott Welcome, a 16-year-old Palmdale High School junior and one of the 
protesters. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just trying to turn this school into a prison. Why should we suffer 
for what the gang-bangers do?" asked Jason Oster, a 15-year-old sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the arrests and protests, officials in the 10,000-student district said 
they remained content with the new policy and have no immediate plans to change 
it. "All I've said is it's going to take some time for the kids to understand 
what the policy is," said Dist. Supt. Kenneth Brummel. 
</P>
<P>
The new policy outlaws any attire that school officials consider gang-related, 
including all non-high school baseball caps, the policy's only blanket 
prohibition. 
</P>
<P>
Students who violate the policy first get a warning, then a suspension for a 
second offense, and possible expulsion beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
However, the district's decision to not provide a specific list of what it 
considers gang-related clothing and apparel has led to widespread 
misunderstandings of the policy among students. School officials said they 
believe that is partly responsible for the protests. 
</P>
<P>
Students repeatedly ticked off long lists of brands, types or colors of 
clothing Thursday that they said have been banned by the district, including 
British Knight tennis shoes -- called "Blood Killers" in gang parlance, 
referring to one of two main gang groupings -- -- professional sports team 
jackets and even any clothes in solid blue or red. 
</P>
<P>
But school officials insisted that such clothing has not been banned, if it is 
not part of a broader dressing pattern that indicates gang membership. "It has 
to do with the manner, the situation, the combinations of clothing that might 
be observed," said Palmdale Principal Linda Janzen. 
</P>
<P>
No dress-code-related protests or problems were reported at the district's 
three smaller high schools: Desert Winds, the continuation school, and Highland 
and Littlerock schools, two temporary sites with only ninth-grade students in 
attendance.

COLLEGE ALLOWS BOOSTERS TO USE TENNIS COURTS, BARS PUBLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
About 60 financial supporters of Glendale Community College have been given 
exclusive use of the school's publicly owned tennis courts when tennis classes 
are not in session. 
</P>
<P>
In a city where hundreds of tennis enthusiasts often endure long waits to use 
28 public courts, the 60 members of the Glendale College Foundation's El 
Vaquero Racquet Club seldom have trouble finding room on the school's six 
tennis courts, which are kept locked from the public. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 18 months, the racquet club members, who pay the foundation annual 
fees of $200, have been issued keys to the courts, which they are allowed sole 
use of from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, as well as 
Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 5 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
College tennis classes are conducted on weekdays and on Tuesday and Thursday 
evenings. 
</P>
<P>
In response to complaints, the foundation tennis club members will have to 
start sharing the courts with the public, beginning this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"It smacks of elitism," said one faculty member, who asked not to be 
identified. "If you don't have the money, it precludes you from playing. 
Students can't practice on the weekends and they want to know why." 
</P>
<P>
Others have questioned the propriety of restricting use of the tennis courts to 
foundation club members, especially because public funds were used to purchase 
and maintain the college property and pay for the courts, said Robert K. 
Holmes, a college Board of Trustees member. 
</P>
<P>
"The complaint has been that it should be open to the public since public 
dollars paid for it," Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale College President John A. Davitt, who defended the arrangement with 
the foundation, said, "We have no obligation to make the courts available to 
the public at all." 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit college foundation was granted exclusive use of the courts in an 
informal agreement with the Glendale Community College District's Board of 
Trustees after the school's three original tennis courts were razed to make 
room for a three-story classroom building, Davitt said. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation, guided by a 34-member board of directors, raises money for 
campus improvements and social events. 
</P>
<P>
College officials said the campus had $1.16 million to spend for three new 
tennis courts, as well as a planned parking lot project. "But six courts was 
the ideal, educationally, because one instructor can watch six courts," Davitt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
So the foundation offered to raise $250,000 over five years to pay part of the 
cost of building six tennis courts, said Jim Cashion, foundation president. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, the college agreed to grant the foundation exclusive use of the 
courts when tennis classes aren't using them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"My response to complaints is that had it not been for the foundation, those 
additional courts would not even exist, and the chances for people playing on 
the courts would be even less," Cashion said. "Furthermore, members of the 
tennis club are not using the courts the entire time." 
</P>
<P>
College officials said the courts must be kept locked when classes are not in 
session to prevent vandalism. But Cashion said the public can use the courts on 
the weekends when foundation club members are not using them by climbing over a 
barrier. 
</P>
<P>
But signs posted at the courts say: "This tennis court is reserved for the El 
Vaquero Racquet Club." The word reserved is underlined. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation's exclusive-use arrangement will change beginning this summer, 
when a concession stand is built next to the tennis courts, Holmes said. The 
college will hire clerks to take reservations from the public and watch over 
the tennis courts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes pushed for the arrangement to restrict the hours controlled by the 
foundation tennis club to weekends, from 6:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. In addition, 
the foundation would be allowed to control use of only two of the college's six 
courts during those hours, Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
The public will be charged $10 an hour to play on the courts once the tennis 
concession stand is finished, college officials said. City-owned tennis courts, 
which require reservations, cost between $2 and $3.50 an hour, city officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The city courts are "crowded and popular," said Bob MacKay, community services 
supervisor. "There are a lot of tennis players in Glendale." 
</P>
<P>
The foundation paid $50,000 of its $250,000 pledge last June and has raised 
about $16,000 toward this year's $50,000 payment, Executive Director Ann 
Ransford said. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation raises money to pay its pledge through the tennis club 
memberships and by soliciting donors to pay for commemorative tiles that will 
decorate a grandstand at the tennis courts, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The El Vaquero Racquet Club, which last fall had a waiting list of 60, now has 
one or two openings for six-month memberships, each costing $100, foundation 
officials said. By comparison, tennis memberships at the La Canada Flintridge 
Country Club cost $4,000, plus $80 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Ransford said the tennis club arrangement was not intended to exclude the 
public from using the campus facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"Our major concern was to keep them in good condition for the college," 
Ransford said. "They are some of the nicest courts in Glendale."

'SUPER MAX'; 
</P>
<P>
CELEBRATION: PRESIDENT BUSH HELPS THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT DEDICATE A HIGH-TECH 
JAIL IN CASTAIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The maximum-security county jail in Castaic dubbed "Super Max" by President 
Bush when he opened it Thursday is a state-of-the-art facility that was 
designed with the help of the officers who will guard its 2,064 inmates. 
</P>
<P>
A giant security complex consisting of five smaller jails, the $134-million 
North County Correctional Facility is on 34 acres of the Peter J. Pitchess 
Honor Rancho, which already houses about 7,500 minimum-, medium- and 
maximum-security inmates. 
</P>
<P>
The facility will ease crowding at 10 county jails, which, as of Thursday, held 
close to 23,000 inmates. These jails have a state-rated capacity of 13,464, 
said Deputy Rafael Estrada, a department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said the facility's 
electronic surveillance and control system will allow fewer deputies to keep 
watch over more inmates. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the average inmate-to-staff ratio is 3.4 to 1. At the County Jail, 
the ratio will be 5.8 inmates to 1, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A central computer system can lock and unlock all doors in the 
681,422-square-foot complex, from individual cells to the main entrance of the 
administration building. The control center has 28 television monitors hooked 
up to 128 cameras stationed strategically throughout the complex. 
</P>
<P>
A committee of sheriff's deputies helped engineers decide where to place the 
television cameras to avoid blind spots common in other jails, said Deputy 
Gregory Frum, an Honor Rancho guard and committee member. 
</P>
<P>
Frum, who stood guard at the entrance, where Bush arrived by helicopter, said 
deputies particularly wanted cameras stationed in all hallways. "It will cut 
down on inmate fights," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After Bush delivered brief remarks saluting the jail and the Sheriff's 
Department, hundreds of people from the audience of 1,600 toured the facility, 
which is expected to begin receiving inmates March 8. But as one sheriff's 
deputy dryly noted to two women on the tour, "We were supposed to get our first 
prisoners a year ago." 
</P>
<P>
Last spring's opening was delayed when engineers discovered that the complex 
computer system could not lock doors on command. For a time, toilets would not 
flush because soil and particles in the Honor Rancho well water clogged the 
pipes. 
</P>
<P>
The jail was built with $131 million provided by state and county bond measures 
for jail construction. In December, the Board of Supervisors approved an 
additional $2.7 million to complete the latest expansion project at the Honor 
Rancho. Two years ago, the county officials opened a 1,600-bed, medium-security 
jail.

TORRANCE'S STANCE ON MEASURE A 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is an old adage that "politics makes strange bedfellows." 
</P>
<P>
Confusion created by the intense media campaigns generated by both sides of the 
Measure A issue on the Torrance municipal ballot vividly demonstrates the truth 
of this saying. 
</P>
<P>
Measure A is opposed by Mayor Katy Geissert and council members Bill Applegate, 
Dee Hardison, George Nakano, Tim Mock and Mark Wirth. 
</P>
<P>
Measure A is supported by only one council member, its author, Dan Walker. 
</P>
<P>
The council majority is not supportive of the continued use of hydrogen 
fluoride in the alkylation process at the Mobil Oil refinery. 
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, the city has been deeply involved for the past year in 
preparation of a comprehensive public nuisance lawsuit against Mobil. This suit 
is aimed at giving the city greater control over the storage and use of 
hazardous substances, including hydrogen fluoride, at the refinery. We have 
been advised by our attorneys that this legal action is the most effective 
means to assure the safety of our residents. 
</P>
<P>
The city has committed $1 million to date in preparation of this suit, and the 
suit will soon be ready to go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
Passage of Measure A will not only complicate the city's lawsuit, but might 
well delay its going to trial for years to come. In the meantime, a wide array 
of safety issues will go unaddressed by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
The confusion arises in the public's mind because Mobil Oil is also opposing 
Measure A. Their opposition is for totally different reasons than the 
opposition of the City Council majority. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil Oil certainly does not support the city's lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
We urge you to vote no on Measure A so that the full strength of the city of 
Torrance can be put behind court action mandating safe operation of the Mobil 
refinery.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PORT ENVIRONMENTAL DIRECTOR NAMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Port of Los Angeles has a new director of its environmental management 
division -- Donald Rice, who has been the port's second-ranking environmental 
official for the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Rice replaces Lillian Kawasaki, whom Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley appointed 
recently as manager of the city's newly created Environmental Affairs 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Rice, 45, of Huntington Beach, joined the port in 1974 as a marine 
environmental assistant and became its assistant environmental management 
director in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
During that time, he participated in dozens of scuba-dives aimed at gathering 
biological samples, planting kelp beds along the breakwater, and searching for 
historically significant shipwrecks. 
</P>
<P>
Rice's new salary will be $62,619 a year, an official with the personnel 
division said.

OPTIMISTS' RECYCLING PLANT NO LONGER IN THE DUMPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Escondido service club that was forced to close its nonprofit recycling 
center earlier this year has turned its dark cloud into a silver lining. 
</P>
<P>
The Noon Optimist Club announced Thursday that its recycling center on West 
Washington Avenue -- operated by the club for 18 years to earn funds for youth 
groups -- has been sold to the for-profit Escondido Sales Yard, situated about 
a block and a half away. 
</P>
<P>
Club president Stan Oleksy said the Escondido firm "is the best deal we could 
hope for" in gaining continued funding for the many youth groups the club 
sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
Oleksy said the agreement with Escondido Sales Yard "will bring in more money 
for our projects than we made from operating the recycling center." That 
prediction is based on an expected increase in volume because of the yard's 
larger recycling business. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, recycling equipment and vehicles used at the Optimists' 
facility were purchased by the sales yard to be used at the new location. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Hubbard, manager of the Escondido Sales Yard, said the recycling 
business generated by the club will be credited to an account opened for it. 
</P>
<P>
In effect, Noon Optimist Club will be gaining more funds "without all the 
hassle," Oleksy said. 
</P>
<P>
An auditor hired by the Optimists is still trying to piece together the 
financial history of the Optimist recycling operations, which went out of 
business in January after several management changes failed to make the center 
turn a profit. The audit was prompted after club officers raised questions 
about thousands of dollars of recycling center funds unaccounted for in sketchy 
records kept by a club member who operated the center. 
</P>
<P>
The center was the chief source of money for the Optimists' many civic 
projects, ranging from a youth fishing day to an anti-drug program, Oleksy 
said. Sale of the Optimist recycling equipment and "good will" brought in 
enough money to settle current debts of the defunct recycling center, he said. 
He declined to reveal the sale price. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard said that Escondido Sales Yard has been operating in the city for about 
25 years, dealing in new and used building materials. About a year ago, a 
3.5-acre recycling center was added next to the sales yard at 1428 W. Mission 
Ave. 
</P>
<P>
Oleksy said that Hubbard had pledged to reopen recycling bins at all Escondido 
schools where discards finance extracurricular activities and to credit the 
Noon Optimist Club account for all new business members brought into the sales 
yard recycling operation. 
</P>
<P>
Several companies made offers to take over the club's recycling operations, 
Oleksy said, "but this was by far the best for us, better than we could have 
hoped for." 
</P>
<P>
The joint recycling operations began Thursday, Oleksy said. 
</P>
<P>
And, as a bonus, he said, Hubbard plans to become a member of the Noon Optimist 
Club.

PSYCHIATRISTS SAY SUSPECT IN STUDIO GUARDS' SLAYINGS WAS INSANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three court-appointed psychiatrists have concluded that a man who gunned down 
two Universal Studios security guards while stalking actor Michael Landon in 
1988 was insane at the time of the killings, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The conclusions have prompted the Los Angeles County district attorney's office 
to consider a possible plea agreement with Nathan N. Trupp that would avoid a 
trial. Trupp, 43, a former mental patient, has pleaded not guilty by reason of 
insanity. 
</P>
<P>
Trupp allegedly shot and killed guards Jaren Beeks, 27, and Armando Torres, 18, 
on Dec. 1, 1988. He later told investigators that he believed that the guards, 
who manned the main gate, were Nazis. He said he shot them after they refused 
to let him into the studio complex to see Landon, whom Trupp also believed to 
be a Nazi. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the shootings, Trupp was the object of a nationwide manhunt over 
the killings, two days earlier, of three people at an Albuquerque, N.M., bagel 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
Trupp, who had been living in Albuquerque, told investigators that he shot the 
three victims because they sold him poisoned bagels. He then took a bus to Los 
Angeles to look for Landon. 
</P>
<P>
After being charged in the Universal killings, Trupp was found incompetent to 
stand trial by two psychiatrists who diagnosed him as having a psychotic mental 
disorder. 
</P>
<P>
Four months later, after being treated with psychotropic drugs at a San 
Bernardino County mental hospital, he was ruled competent. He pleaded not 
guilty by reason of insanity Dec. 6, 1989, and the three new psychiatric 
examinations were ordered. 
</P>
<P>
If Trupp is found not guilty by reason of insanity he would be committed to a 
state mental hospital for life unless psychiatrists conducting yearly 
examinations determine that his sanity has been restored. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Sterling E. Norris said the psychiatrists who filed reports 
with the court last month were chosen jointly by prosecutors and Trupp's 
attorney, Deputy Public Defender Stephen Lee Hobson. Hobson could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"All the conclusions of all three psychiatrists are that he was insane at the 
time of the offense," Norris said. "Those are the bottom-line evaluations." 
</P>
<P>
Norris declined to acknowledge that the examinations' findings bolster Trupp's 
defense and also stopped short of saying his office is negotiating a plea 
agreement in the case. 
</P>
<P>
"We are communicating in relation to a possible plea," Norris said. "There 
still could be a trial. There might not." 
</P>
<P>
In making the decision on whether to go to trial, Norris said, he will seek 
input from prosecutors in New Mexico, where Trupp faces three murder charges. 
The case in Albuquerque has been on hold while the Los Angeles case proceeded. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing in which a trial date will be set or a plea by Trupp will be accepted 
by the prosecution is scheduled April 3 in Los Angeles Municipal Court.

CONCERNED FRIENDS TOOK LA MESA GIRLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANKI V. RANSOM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two La Mesa sisters who were reported missing by their mother had been picked 
up by family friends who were concerned about the children's welfare, police 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Olivia Silva, 7, called Stan and Layola Adams when her 4-year-old sister, 
Carolyn, became sick sometime after 2:30 a.m. Wednesday, La Mesa police Lt. 
Allan Joslyn said. 
</P>
<P>
The Adamses picked up the children about 3:30 a.m. and took them to their home 
in the Clairemont area, Joslyn said. Olivia told the couple that she did not 
want to live with her mother anymore and instead wanted to stay with an aunt 
who lives in British Columbia, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Joslyn said the aunt was notified, and the Adamses put the girls on an airplane 
that arrived shortly after 11 p.m. in Bellingham, Wash., about 80 miles north 
of Seattle and 18 miles south of the Canadian border. 
</P>
<P>
The aunt had planned to meet the girls at the airport, but sheriff's deputies 
in Whatcom County met them instead, then turned them over to Child Protective 
Services in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The Adamses told investigators that they were concerned that the girls' mother, 
Ester Silva, was not taking good care of them, Joslyn said. 
</P>
<P>
He said they told police that, after watching news accounts of the girls' 
disappearance, they called Silva, and that a friend of Silva's called police. 
When investigators arrived at the Adams home after 9 p.m. Wednesday, the girls 
were already gone, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Child-stealing charges will not be filed against the Adamses, Joslyn said; 
however, child-endangerment charges might be filed against the mother for 
leaving the children unattended early Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Ester Silva, 34, and a friend gave conflicting accounts of the time they left 
the residence on Lake Murray Boulevard, Police Capt. Wayne Beatty said. 
</P>
<P>
Silva told police they left the condominium at 4:30 a.m. to pick up her car 
from the home of a friend who was repairing it, and that they returned at 5:30 
a.m., Beatty said. But the friend told investigators that they left at 2:30 
a.m., returning at 5:30 a.m., he said. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the friend, who refused to give her name, had speculated that 
whoever took the children was probably someone who was owed money by Silva's 
late husband. Anthony Silva was killed in July during a dispute over a drug 
deal, according to a coroner's report. 
</P>
<P>
Silva told authorities that, when she and the friend returned, the doors to the 
residence were still locked and there were no signs of forced entry, Beatty 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Olivia had let the Adamses in through the back door, Joslyn said.

NORTH ISLAND EMPLOYEE BEING QUESTIONED IN PROSTITUTES' SLAYINGS 
</P>

<P>
A young public works employee at North Island Naval Air Station was arrested 
Thursday on suspicion of assaulting a prostitute, and authorities are 
questioning the man in the slayings of dozens of other prostitutes in San Diego 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Jim Cooke of the county Sheriff's Department said after the morning arrest 
at the base that "we're not saying yet" that James Morris Jackson, 23, is a 
suspect in the string of 40 slayings of young street women, most of them 
prostitutes and drug addicts. 
</P>
<P>
"But naturally, because of the nature of the crime, we're going to look at him 
and see if there's any possible connection," Cooke said. "He may have been 
involved in the other cases, but we don't know yet." 
</P>
<P>
The special Metropolitan Homicide Task Force investigating the slaying first 
became interested in Jackson when it was reviewing routine San Diego police 
cases involving prostitutes, Cooke said. 
</P>
<P>
It learned of a case in which a female prostitute was abducted in San Diego 
early Monday morning and assaulted. Investigators identified Jackson as a 
suspect, then began trailing him, Cooke said. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday morning, they arrested him after he drove over the San 
Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge about 6 a.m. on his way to work at the air station, 
where he is a civilian employee. Cooke said Jackson did not resist arrest, and 
he was taken to police headquarters for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
Police declined to release a photograph of Jackson; Cooke said detectives plan 
to have him appear in a lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jackson was taken to County Jail and booked on suspicion of assault 
with force likely to cause great bodily injury, false imprisonment and forcible 
oral copulation in the Monday assault. 
</P>
<P>
The arrest is the seventh made by the task force since it was formed in 1988. 
Five of the cases have resulted in convictions. Cooke said the remaining case 
goes to trial later this month. In that case, Alan Michael Stevens is charged 
with murder in a November, 1988, slaying near Pala-Temecula Road in North 
County. 
</P>
<P>
The task force, composed of city police and sheriff's deputies, was created 
after intense publicity about the series of prostitute slayings. Most of the 
women were abducted in the city and their bodies found in remote parts of the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
The killings began in 1985, just after a similar set of slayings ended in the 
so-called Green River series of prostitute murders in the Seattle area. Those 
slayings also remain unsolved.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GOP ACTIVIST TO RUN FOR LA FOLLETTE'S SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paula Boland, a Granada Hills real estate broker and longtime Republican 
activist, said Thursday that she will run for the GOP nomination for the 
Assembly seat being vacated by Marian La Follette of Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Boland, 50, is the second Republican candidate to jump into the race to succeed 
La Follette, who surprised observers this week by announcing that she will not 
seek reelection in the 38th Assembly District, which arcs across the northern 
San Fernando Valley from Hidden Hills to Tujunga. 
</P>
<P>
La Follette on Tuesday endorsed an aide, Rob Wilcox, 24, to take her seat. 
Wilcox, who also has been on the staff of state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia), has 
been active in La Follette's long-running but unsuccessful campaign to break 
the Los Angeles Unified School District into smaller school systems. 
</P>
<P>
Boland, who is making her first run for public office, is a member of the 
conservative California Republican Assembly and has frequently volunteered in 
GOP campaigns. She has been endorsed by two influential fellow conservatives, 
Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) and Los Angeles City Councilman Hal 
Bernson. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the June 5 GOP primary will face the Democratic nominee in 
November. The district is generally considered GOP turf, and Republicans 
outnumber Democrats 87,000 to 74,500.

KELCO WORKERS PROTEST CONTRACT WITH FIRST STRIKE IN DECADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first strike in a decade at Kelco, the nation's largest harvester of kelp, 
got under way Thursday as nearly half of its San Diego-based workers stayed off 
the job, a company spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Zapoticzny, manager of public affairs for Kelco, confirmed that the 187 
members of Local 501 of the International Union of Operating Engineers voted 3 
to 1 Wednesday to reject the company's new contract. 
</P>
<P>
The old contract expired at midnight. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all very surprised that it was rejected because we felt we had made 
significant improvements in wage, pension and other benefits," said Zapoticzny, 
who declined to discuss specifics of the offer. "We still don't know what 
triggered the rejection. We're still willing to negotiate." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, as pickets began marching at Kelco headquarters in the harbor area 
under the San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge, some machinists refused to cross the 
picket lines formed by the janitors, chemical operators and maintenance 
mechanics that compose the operating engineers' union. Zapoticzny said about 
250 union workers walked out. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the machinists' union had voted to accept a new contract very similar 
to the one the operating engineers rejected. 
</P>
<P>
Kelco, which has harvested kelp since 1929, employs about 600 workers in San 
Diego. Extracts from the kelp are used in the manufacture of some foods, 
cosmetics, oil and chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
The last strike against Kelco was in 1980 and lasted for two weeks, Zapoticzny 
said.

'ALLIANCE' ATTORNEY ADMITS TO INSURANCE FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A seventh figure in the "Alliance" attorney fraud case pleaded guilty to mail 
fraud Thursday, saying he helped a ring of Los Angeles lawyers bilk insurance 
companies by making litigation "as complex, convoluted and extended as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
Gar C. May, 49, a La Jolla optometrist and businessman, pleaded guilty to two 
counts of mail fraud before U.S. District Judge Judith N. Keep. 
</P>
<P>
Each count is punishable by up to five years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement he read in court, May said he got kickbacks from two San 
Fernando Valley lawyers who defended him in lawsuits at insurance company 
expense. And he said he scouted the San Diego area on the lawyers' behalf for 
other insured parties who could be sued and have their legal fees paid by 
insurers. 
</P>
<P>
"The Alliance" is a nickname some of the members of the group purportedly used 
for themselves and which federal authorities now use. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers, from the San Fernando Valley, Beverly Hills and West Los Angeles, 
appeared together in a number of complex civil cases in Los Angeles, Orange and 
San Diego counties from about 1984 to 1988. Prosecutors and insurance company 
lawyers say they may have billed up to $200 million in the cases.

<P>
An East San Diego man was arrested Wednesday night in connection with several 
armed robberies at motels countywide, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Exton Hullaby, 36, is being held at County Jail in lieu of $15,000 bail on 
suspicion of armed robbery and parole violation. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Bill Robinson said an off-duty police officer, James Tucker, 
saw Hullaby about 8 p.m. Wednesday driving a maroon Lincoln Continental that 
fit the description of the car used in several of the robberies. 
</P>
<P>
Since December, at least 23 robberies in what police labeled the "Motel Knife 
and Gun Series" have taken place in San Diego, El Cajon, Chula Vista, 
Clairemont, Carlsbad and Lemon Grove, Sgt. Reggie Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
The robber went to the motels' front offices and ordered the victims to lie 
down, then stole money from the offices.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: NATIONAL CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A National City man was charged Wednesday by a federal grand jury in San Diego 
with four counts of odometer tampering, the U.S. attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
Ernesto Guzman operated the now-defunct Golden Auto Brokers in National City 
for two years. 
</P>
<P>
He was indicted for allegedly tampering with four automobile odometers from 
Nov. 4, 1987, to Aug. 23, 1988. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 
three years in prison, a $50,000 fine or both. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators from the state Department of Motor Vehicles seized several 
vehicles, a large amount of cash, and cocaine and marijuana during a search 
last year of Guzman's home and dealership. Guzman was convicted in San Diego 
Superior Court for possession of cocaine with intent to sell, and is awaiting 
sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, Congress passed a law forbidding alteration of an odometer's reading.

A man charged with holding up 17 businesses, mostly Blockbuster video stores, 
pleaded guilty Thursday to 14 counts of armed robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Cruz Loza, 31, of San Diego changed his plea just before his 
preliminary hearing was to begin. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge Charles Patrick then set sentencing for March 29. Loza faces a 
maximum sentence of 33 years in state prison and a $20,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
The robberies ranged from San Marcos to National City, and lasted from Sept. 26 
to Dec. 26. All but one of the stores were Blockbusters. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Steve Anear had subpoenaed 24 witnesses to testify Thursday 
and today for the preliminary hearing. He said Loza had a prior conviction for 
robbery and was released on parole last April.

TEXAS AIR TOOK EASTERN'S ASSETS, EXAMINER SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: A COURT-APPOINTED OFFICIAL FINDS EVIDENCE TO WARRANT CHARGES. BUT, HE 
SAYS, THE PARENT FIRM HAS AGREED TO REPAY $280 MILLION TO AVOID LITIGATION. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Texas Air Corp. systematically stripped valuable assets from its Eastern 
Airlines subsidiary before Eastern filed for bankruptcy a year ago, the 
court-appointed bankruptcy examiner charged Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The examiner, David I. Shapiro, said in a 500-page report filed with the court 
that in 12 out of 15 such transactions that he investigated, "there is 
sufficient evidence to warrant the bringing of charges that the transactions 
provided Eastern with less than fair consideration or reasonably equivalent 
value." 
</P>
<P>
However, to prevent such litigation, Shapiro said, Texas Air has agreed to 
repay $280 million to Eastern, of which $133 million will be paid in cash. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro, who said he examined more than 300,000 pages of documents from Eastern 
and interviewed 101 witnesses, concluded that the 12 claims would have an 
aggregate value "in the range of roughly $285 million and $403 million." 
</P>
<P>
The asset transfers, all of which occurred before Eastern filed for bankruptcy 
last March 9, had been harshly criticized by Eastern's creditors and especially 
by its unions. 
</P>
<P>
The transactions cited by Shapiro include Eastern's sale to Texas Air of its 
System One computer reservation system in 1987. Texas Air paid Eastern for the 
system with a $100-million note payable in 2012. Shapiro's report said the deal 
was undervalued by between $150 million and $250 million. (Last week, Texas Air 
announced that it was selling half of the CRS system for $250 million to a 
subsidiary of General Motors.) 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro also said gate leases at Newark Airport sold by Eastern to Continental 
Airlines, which is Texas Air's other airline subsidiary, were undervalued by 
between $10 million and $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
He also challenged the 1-cent-a-gallon that Eastern had to pay Texas Air for 
"fuel management," saying it cost the airline $18.8 million from 1986 to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the report completely validates the reason for our strike," 
said Charles Bryan, head of Eastern's machinists union local, which struck the 
airline five days before the bankruptcy filing. The strike is still going. 
</P>
<P>
"We have said all along that Frank Lorenzo (chairman of both Texas Air and 
Eastern) was extorting Eastern and exploiting his control over the airline by 
taking its assets and destroying it financially," Bryan said. "In this way, he 
drove Eastern into bankruptcy. We are disappointed that criminal action was not 
brought against Eastern and that the examiner did not appoint a trustee." 
</P>
<P>
The unions had urged all along that a trustee be appointed to oversee the 
day-to-day operations of the Miami-based carrier, in effect taking over 
management of the airline. 
</P>
<P>
But Shapiro, in his report to the court, recommended against the appointment of 
a trustee, saying it "could so disrupt Eastern's business and its ability to 
sell tickets," he said, "as to make its continued viability . . . untenable." 
</P>
<P>
But Shapiro did recommend that the bankruptcy court not approve a plan of 
reorganization that would allow the carrier to emerge from bankruptcy unless 
some kind of a watchdog is appointed. 
</P>
<P>
"Safeguards against any future sacrifice of Eastern's interests to those of 
Texas Air" are essential, he said, because of "the continuing danger of 
conflicts of interest." He said the plan of reorganization should not be 
approved "unless and until" Texas Air takes steps to protect Eastern's 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
He suggested such steps as establishment of a monitoring method under the 
court's supervision -- such as appointment of a "special independent committee 
of directors" -- to review all intercompany transactions worth more than 
$500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Air and Eastern, in a statement, acknowledged the settlement but took 
issue with the report, saying it "is replete with faulty analyses, hearsay 
evidence, statements taken out of context and misstatements of fact." 
</P>
<P>
Eastern and its creditors, after nearly a year of negotiations, last week 
agreed on a reorganization plan that would pay unsecured creditors a little 
less than 50 cents on every dollar owed. 
</P>
<P>
After Shapiro filed his report with the court Thursday, bankruptcy Judge Burton 
R. Lifland heard arguments on whether a trustee should be appointed. Lifland 
postponed a decision until April 3. 
</P>
<P>
But before the postponement there was heated debate between Shapiro and a 
lawyer representing the Air Line Pilots Assn., which struck Eastern in sympathy 
with the machinists but returned to work in November. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Simon, a lawyer representing ALPA, argued: "Just what does it take for 
the court to understand that this case has been permeated by flimflam. Despite 
the clear rape of this debtor by its parent, (Shapiro) wants the rapist to go 
free." Shapiro countered angrily that the unions had not negotiated in good 
faith to help the airline out of Chapter 11. 
</P>
<P>
"The unions blew it. They blew it," the examiner shouted. "Their people are on 
the street, and now they want to put 17,000 more people on the street and 
jeopardize the pensions of a lot of their own members. I say, enough 
destruction. Let's start building it back." 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the judge Thursday approved a disbursement of $60 million to 
Eastern to enable it to meet its obligations this month. The money will come 
from an escrow fund accumulated from the sale of Eastern's assets. 
</P>
<P>
"If we do not fund Eastern today," a lawyer for the airline told the judge, 
"the company will no longer operate."

ROCKWELL DISPLAYS EXPERIMENTAL JET DESIGNED TO TURN AND AIM QUICKLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ever since Orville Wright flew for the first time, aircraft have faced an 
insurmountable aerodynamic barrier. Known as stall, it occurs when wings fail 
to provide adequate lift and an aircraft plummets. 
</P>
<P>
The new experimental X-31 jet fighter, which is supposed to break that barrier, 
was rolled out Thursday in Palmdale at ceremonies by Rockwell International and 
its West German partner, Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm. 
</P>
<P>
The fighter-type aircraft, built under joint funding by the Pentagon and the 
West German government, is expected to make its first flight late next month. 
The cost of developing the technology and building two planes is put at about 
$200 million, which includes 400 hours of flight testing. 
</P>
<P>
The X-31's capability of breaking the stall barrier should allow it to turn and 
point at targets much more quickly than conventional fighters, which could 
cause revolutionary changes in air combat. 
</P>
<P>
If a current-generation fighter attempted such slow, sharp turns as the X-31 is 
expected to demonstrate, it would be likely to enter a stall, lose altitude and 
fall out of control. 
</P>
<P>
"It is like disconnecting the steering wheel on your car at 65 miles per hour," 
said Sam Iacobellis, Rockwell International executive vice president. "But in 
the X-31, you can get out of it. It is a natural progression in moving past 
that barrier." 
</P>
<P>
If the X-31 succeeds in radically improving an aircraft's turning and pointing 
capability, it will open to question the very costly design philosophy in air 
combat that the military services have embraced for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
That philosophy has been one that favors very high speeds, powerful air radars 
and long-range missiles that allow fighter pilots to enter battle at ranges 
well beyond the range of human eyesight. 
</P>
<P>
But plans to conduct battles at long range are controversial, because missiles 
like the Phoenix, Sparrow and Amraam designed for such battles have yet to 
prove they can successfully destroy targets at medium and long ranges. Missile 
experts say the Sparrow was successful only 10% of the time in the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
An even more basic problem with long-range combat is the inability of 
electronic systems to determine which aircraft are hostile. In 1988, the U.S. 
Navy shot down an Iranian passenger jetliner with a medium-range missile, for 
example. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell is not attempting to become an industry maverick with the X-31, but 
the theory behind the plane suggests that modern jet fighters can benefit by 
having better close-in fighting capability and more agility. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather have a cheap missile on an aircraft that comes back than an 
expensive missile that doesn't come back," said Leonard S. Freeman, a technical 
director at the Naval Air Systems Command, which is managing the X-31 program. 
"The X-31 gives another trick in the bag for the pilot." 
</P>
<P>
But pilots will have to be persuaded to forfeit high speed in combat in 
exchange for maneuverability. "If you run out of air speed, you run out of 
tricks -- that's the conventional wisdom," Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the X-31 different is its ability to quickly restore lost speed. It 
is powered by a General Electric engine with thrust of 16,000 pounds at sea 
level, providing a powerful 1.25 to 1 thrust to weight ratio. The X-31 is 43 
feet long and has a wing span of 24 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The need for highly maneuverable aircraft emerged in the late 1970s, when 
missiles were developed that could shoot down aircraft in head-on engagements. 
Until then, pilots had to maneuver behind an enemy aircraft in dog fights. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Herbst, director for advanced design and technology at MBB, originated 
the concept for the X-31 but could not persuade the West German air force to 
fund it, he said Thursday in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that while long-range combat is important, many engagements 
will quickly degenerate into short-range. Then, the aircraft that can turn and 
point its weapons fastest will win. Herbst said the X-31 will be able to 
execute a 180-degree turn in a diameter of roughly 100 meters at a speed of 
about 150 knots. 
</P>
<P>
The maneuverability is provided by thrust vectoring of the engine, in which the 
exhaust stream from the engine is directed by three paddles. That system, in 
addition to small forward wings called canards, will enable it to fly at high 
angles of attack that enable the sharp turns. An angle of attack is something 
of a controlled slide through the air, in which the aircraft's nose is pointed 
up while the plane continues in a horizontal line of flight. 
</P>
<P>
A key measure of the maneuvering capability of a jet fighter is how sharp an 
angle of attack it can fly. Conventional fighters can fly at up to 35 degrees. 
The X-31 aims to double that. 
</P>
<P>
"I think all future fighter aircraft will have thrust vectoring," said John 
Pierro, president of Rockwell's North American Aircraft unit, which built the 
X-31.

SEC SEEKS A ROLE IN PROCEEDINGS ON DREXEL BANKRUPTCY

<P>
In an unprecedented move, the Securities and Exchange Commission attempted 
Thursday to intervene in Drexel Burnham Lambert Group's bankruptcy proceedings, 
claiming that the federal agency is Drexel's largest creditor. 
</P>
<P>
The claim stems from Drexel's settlement of civil and criminal charges last 
year, in which the firm agreed to establish a $350-million fund to be used to 
pay judgments in civil suits filed by private parties as a result of Drexel's 
admitted illegal activities. Drexel still owed the fund $150 million when it 
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Feb. 13. The SEC said Drexel also 
owes an unspecified amount for taxes on interest that the fund earned from the 
money already paid in. 
</P>
<P>
In papers filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, the SEC demanded a 
role on Drexel's creditors committee. Richard A. Kirby, an SEC lawyer, said 
this is necessary to make sure the SEC's interests in receiving payment are 
taken into account in whatever plan is eventually worked out to pay creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Kirby said one SEC concern is to ensure that Drexel assets weren't improperly 
dissipated in the months immediately before the bankruptcy filing. Members of 
Drexel's creditors committee, formed Tuesday, have made it known that they also 
are concerned about reports that Drexel paid out large bonuses and may have 
made other payments to senior executives shortly before the filing. 
</P>
<P>
"The SEC and any creditor has a concern if there has been money paid by the 
debtor improperly," Kirby said. A. Robert Abboud, chairman and chief executive 
of First City Texas Bancorporation, was elected chairman of the creditors 
committee. First City has already filed papers demanding that an examiner be 
appointed to look into payments to executives, among other issues. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC had asked for full membership on the creditors committee. But after a 
court hearing Thursday, Kirby said the agency may be willing to settle for 
non-voting, ex officio status provided that it could attend all meetings and 
participate fully. A court hearing on the subject is scheduled for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Kirby said the SEC had never before attempted to gain membership on a creditors 
committee in a bankruptcy case. But he said the move was made necessary by the 
amount of money still owed under Drexel's settlement. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC's claim is the largest made public so far. But it is expected that 
claims comparable in size may yet emerge, including one by former Drexel junk 
bond chief Michael Milken, who is said to be owed at least $100 million by 
Drexel and possibly up to twice that amount. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel hasn't paid Milken for the Drexel stock he turned in, as required, when 
he resigned after his indictment on racketeering charges last year. The firm 
also didn't pay him his bonus for 1988 and his salary for 1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Milken himself made no attempt to get on the creditors committee, according to 
Neal Mann, the assistant U.S. trustee who selected the committee members. 
However, sources close to former Drexel employees said one committee member, 
Sylvan Schefler, a former Drexel managing director, is a close friend and 
confidant of Milken and may unofficially represent his interests on the 
committee and act as a conduit of information to Milken about steps the 
committee is taking. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Schefler confirmed that he speaks frequently with 
Milken. But he emphatically denied that he was representing Milken's interests 
on the committee. Schefler said he was named to the committee because he is 
owed more than $5 million by Drexel, from stock he turned in that was converted 
into subordinated debt. He said he represents himself and a group of other 
former Drexel executives in a similar position, but he said the group doesn't 
include Milken. 
</P>
<P>
A Milken spokesman refused to comment on what steps Milken will take in the 
bankruptcy proceedings. But he also denied that Schefler will act on Milken's 
behalf. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington on Thursday, Chairman Alan Greenspan of the Federal Reserve Board 
told a House Judiciary subcommittee that the Fed's decision not to step in to 
prevent Drexel's bankruptcy appears to have been vindicated. The calm, 
post-Chapter 11 reaction by the stock and bond markets "tends to validate the 
judgment that the failure of Drexel, while a tragedy for the many involved, did 
not present undue risks to the orderly functioning of the financial system or 
the economy," Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
In response to a question from Rep. Jack Brooks (D-Tex.), Greenspan said the 
Fed became aware of Drexel's crisis only about a week before the bankruptcy 
filing. He said the Fed and other federal agencies intervened only to the 
extent of monitoring the situation to see that Drexel's problems didn't spill 
over to involve other firms or the securities markets in general.

BOSKIN ADVISES WEST GERMANY TO AVOID RATE HIKE 
</P>

<P>
The White House's chief economist urged the West German central bank Thursday 
not to boost interest rates as part of its strategy for coping with economic 
integration with East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The comments by Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the White House Council of 
Economic Advisers, reflected widespread concerns here that any further increase 
in West German rates would quickly cross the Atlantic, damaging prospects for a 
rebound in the sluggish U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
Interest rates in Europe soared early this year as the political and economic 
turmoil caused by the rush to unify East and West Germany left investors both 
nervous about the prospects for inflation and eager to take advantage of a 
potential capital investment boom. Because markets around the globe are linked 
by virtually instantaneous communication, rate increases here promptly echoed 
those in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're a home buyer, you don't care if the pressure comes from home or 
abroad," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Boston Co., an economic 
consulting group. "The bottom line is higher interest rates." 
</P>
<P>
Boskin, in a breakfast with reporters, acknowledged that upward pressure on 
West German interest rates will continue. 
</P>
<P>
The cause, as it often is in the United States, is inflation. East Germany is 
about to adopt the West German currency. Almost certainly, East Germans will be 
able to convert their cash to West German marks at a favorable exchange rate, 
designed to show them that they can look forward to prosperity if they stay 
home instead of moving to the West. 
</P>
<P>
The sudden large increase in money and the resulting demand for goods will 
inevitably drive prices up in both Germanys. 
</P>
<P>
Some officials at the West German central bank, the Bundesbank, believe that 
the proper response is to force interest rates up. That is the same sort of 
bitter medicine imposed by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker that 
worked to end the inflationary spiral in the United States a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
But Boskin argued strongly against such an approach. West Germany will 
experience nothing more than a temporary inflation shock, he said, and after 
that, prices should level off. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst thing they could do is to tighten and cause a recession," Boskin 
said. "There's no reason a one-time price hike should lead to a wage-price 
spiral." 
</P>
<P>
Boskin's message to the West Germans was unusually blunt. Administration 
officials have generally shied away from talking publicly about German economic 
policy since then-Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III rattled investors with 
tough comments on the subject just before the October, 1987, stock market 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
The West Germans "shouldn't be tightening in anticipation of worrying about a 
temporary increase in prices," Boskin said. "They should accommodate it." 
</P>
<P>
He said that folding the Communist system in East Germany into West Germany's 
vibrant capitalist economy -- a move that is likely to accelerate sharply after 
East Germans go to the polls March 18 -- is like "buying an asset with a huge 
potential future." 
</P>
<P>
Germany's independent central bank, Boskin said, should simply accept the 
"one-time price increase" that will result from currency unification. "That 
would be better for the German economy," he said, "as well as putting less 
pressure on interest rates elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Many U.S. economists are worried that continued uncertainty over how West 
German officials plan to handle the thorny issues of economic integration and 
widespread anticipation of a flood of capital into Eastern Europe will continue 
to drive interest rates up in Europe and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, U.S. officials and outside analysts have argued that such fears 
may be overblown. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told lawmakers last 
week that financial markets probably have already adjusted to anticipated 
changes. Indeed, the German bond market pulled out of its tailspin slightly 
more than a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
John Hekman, an economist at Claremont Economics Institute in Southern 
California, believes that investors "overreacted to the immediate threat of 
inflation in Germany." But even if interest rates remain high in Germany, 
Hekman thinks U.S. rates will gradually recede as investors return money to 
Wall Street in the belief that they can earn a greater real return over the 
long run from U.S. bonds than from West German securities. 
</P>
<P>
Hekman acknowledged that the American economy is becoming increasingly 
vulnerable to developments abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"It's remarkable how much U.S. markets were pushed around by events in Germany 
and Japan," he said. "We've been talking for years about the integration of 
global financial markets. Now we see the results."

Bank of New England Put Under Limits: In trouble because of a large portfolio 
of bad real estate loans, the banking firm handed over significant control to 
federal regulators. The regulators ordered the Boston-based institution to 
suspend all dividend payments and come up with a plan within 30 days to get it 
and its subsidiaries back on sound footing. Meanwhile, all dividend payments 
have been halted.

STATE AGENCIES ESCALATE ATTACK ON LINCOLN S&amp;L; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: REINER ASKS FOR A GRAND JURY INVESTIGATION. THE CORPORATIONS 
DEPARTMENT IS SEEKING THE RETURN OF AT LEAST $200 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Two state agencies, escalating their legal attack in the Lincoln Savings &amp; 
Loan scandal, are pressing for civil fines and criminal penalties against the 
former operators of the failed Irvine-based thrift. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, acting as a specially appointed 
state attorney general, said Thursday that he has asked for a wide-ranging 
state grand jury investigation into the scandal resulting from Lincoln's 
collapse and the loss of investor funds in its parent company, American 
Continental Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner said a special grand jury, which could be approved and impaneled by the 
end of next week, was needed to handle only Lincoln matters because the current 
grand jury's term will expire in June and the investigation is expected to last 
six to nine months. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the state Department of Corporations, stung by claims that it 
mishandled the approval of American Continental's securities offerings, is 
going on the attack by seeking the return of at least $200 million in investor 
funds from the former operators, including Charles H. Keating Jr., the parent 
company's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
The corporations agency plans to seek restitution from Keating and two top 
aides in a civil lawsuit to be filed this week in Los Angeles County Superior 
Court that alleges violations of state securities laws. The agency also will 
ask the Los Angeles and Orange County district attorney offices to launch 
investigations into possible criminal fraud in the sale of those securities, a 
source close to the case said. 
</P>
<P>
What is unusual about the agency's action, the source said, is that it focuses 
on investment fraud charges while the plethora of investor suits center on 
alleged misleading statements and actions by Keating, his accountants and 
lawyers. Federal regulators have sued Keating and other executives on fraud and 
racketeering charges. 
</P>
<P>
Corporations Commissioner Christine W. Bender said her office would make 
available today copies of statements from about 100 of the 22,000 small 
investors who bought American Continental bonds. The agency also will provide 
statements from some Lincoln and American Continental employees who sold the 
securities in Lincoln's 29 Southern California branches. 
</P>
<P>
Federal regulators seized Lincoln last April, a day after Phoenix-based 
American Continental filed for bankruptcy protection. Bailing out Lincoln is 
expected to cost taxpayers $2 billion, making it the costliest thrift cleanup 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy left in the lurch an unusual class of investors. Many of the 
22,000 people who bought nearly $200 million in short-term bonds were not 
accustomed to buying stocks or bonds. They were mostly Lincoln customers with 
large savings deposits. Many claim in lawsuits that they were subjected to 
"bait-and-switch" techniques by overly aggressive salespeople, and were led to 
believe erroneously that the bonds were federally insured. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, their state court lawsuits also name California as a defendant, 
alleging that the corporations department failed to reject the bond sale or, 
later, halt further sales when it knew American Continental could not repay the 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
An additional 1,000 more-experienced investors bought about $55 million in 
bonds in the normal manner -- through brokerage houses. It was unclear Thursday 
if the corporations department will be seeking $250 million for all bondholders 
or just the amount for those who bought bonds at Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Executives at American Continental -- already subjected to other state and 
federal civil and criminal probes and to a congressional investigation -- 
seemed unfazed by Thursday's actions. 
</P>
<P>
"Reiner? Isn't he a candidate for something?" asked Bradley J. Boland, an 
American Continental spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner, a Democrat, is running for state attorney general but denied that 
politics have anything to do with the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
He and Sacramento County Dist. Atty. Steve White were appointed in December by 
state Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp, also a Democrat, to look into possible 
criminal charges in the Lincoln case. Van de Kamp decided that he had a 
conflict of interest because he had to defend the state in lawsuits brought by 
bondholders. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner, who hired former aide Lynn Miller to head the Lincoln investigation, 
said his agency was taking the lead role in the investigation and that White, a 
former Van de Kamp aide, was helping. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the grand jury's work will be a review of the role that state 
officials played in the Lincoln debacle, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner said a grand jury was needed because it alone had powers to subpoena 
witnesses and documents and to grant immunity to compel testimony.

SIMMONS AIMS AT LOCKHEED GOLDEN PARACHUTES; 
</P>
<P>
TAKEOVERS: GROUP LED BY THE TEXAS FINANCIER URGES SHAREHOLDER VOTE IN EFFORT TO 
ELIMINATE EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE PAY CONTRACTS.

<P>
A group waging a proxy fight for control of Lockheed Corp. on Thursday asked 
the directors of the aerospace firm to consider a proposal to eliminate "golden 
parachute" severance pay for Lockheed executives. 
</P>
<P>
The group, led by Texas financier Harold C. Simmons, asked Lockheed Chairman 
Daniel M. Tellep to present the proposal to shareholders at the company's March 
29 annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed's severance pay contracts call for special payments to five top 
executives in the event of a corporate takeover. If a takeover had occurred 
Jan. 1, for example, Tellep would have received nearly $5.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal to eliminate the payments was advanced by J. Landis Martin, one of 
15 members of a rival slate hoping to replace Lockheed's current directors. 
Martin is president of N.L. Industries, a Houston-based chemical firm 
controlled by Simmons. With an 18.9% stake, N.L Industries is Lockheed's 
largest shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Tellep, Martin cited Simmons' opposition to the concept of 
golden parachutes. 
</P>
<P>
He quoted Simmons' testimony before a Senate committee in 1987, when Simmons 
called the payments a "serious example of management misusing corporate 
resources" and a policy that "should be prohibited, regardless of when they 
were adopted, because there is no business justification for them. Such a 
prohibition flows from the fundamental premise that management should not be 
entitled to misuse corporate assets in an effort to defeat a change of 
control." 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed spokesman Bob Slayman said the severance payment provisions are 
designed to attract and retain management by providing security. 
</P>
<P>
"We have this (provision) and have had it for several years," Slayman said. 
"Most companies our size have similar arrangements." 
</P>
<P>
The size of Lockheed's severance payments is linked to various formulas 
relating to term of service. One provision calls for cash payments of three 
times the officer's base annual salary. Vincent N. Marafino, chief financial 
officer, would have received more than $4 million had a takeover occurred Jan. 
1. The other three executives would have received payments ranging from $1.2 
million to $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
Martin and Simmons, in an attempt to gain control of Lockheed, plan to solicit 
support for their board slate at the March 29 meeting.

JAPAN STOCKS RISE IN EARLY TRADING; YEN GAINS GROUND

Share prices gained moderately on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Friday morning, and 
the dollar fell from its early highs against the yen amid heavy intervention by 
the Bank of Japan to defend its currency. 
</P>
<P>
The 225-issue Nikkei stock average closed the morning session at 34,057.17, up 
227.59 or 0.67%. 
</P>
<P>
It fell 762.41 on Thursday. A moderate 260 million shares changed hands in 
morning trading. 
</P>
<P>
A Nomura Securities trader said the Tokyo exchange has not recovered from its 
continuing weakness during the past two weeks but added that there was no 
reason to fear a big collapse soon. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar closed the morning session at 149.70 yen, down 0.08 yen from its 
Thursday close. It opened at 150.35 yen and fluctuated between 149.50 yen and 
150.50 yen, as Japan's central bank aggressively sold dollars in an attempt to 
defend the yen's value. 
</P>
<P>
Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst at New Japan Securities Co., said there 
was still a tremendous demand for dollars on the Tokyo market because of the 
rapid increase of Japanese firms investing abroad in real estate and 
securities, he said.

Wall Street stocks advanced for the fourth straight session Thursday as traders 
gained confidence that the U.S. economy might do better than expected this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials rose 8.34 to close at 2,635.59. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume was a moderate 157.9 million shares on the New York Stock 
Exchange, compared to 184.4 million Wednesday. Advancing issues outnumbered 
decliners in New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 843 up, 633 down and 
493 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said buying in cyclical sectors such as machinery and automobiles was 
propelled by increasing faith in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a growing belief that the economy is not in as bad shape as was 
thought a couple of months ago," said Dennis Jarrett, analyst at Kidder, 
Peabody &amp; Co. If interest rates begin to fall, he said, "we could have a 
dynamite market." 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Purchasing Management said the industrial economy 
continued to contract in February but at a slower rate than in previous months. 
But the slight improvement in the manufacturing sector was mainly because of 
one-time factors linked to unusually cold December weather, the private group 
said. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Commerce Department said the economy grew at a 0.9% annual 
rate in the fourth quarter, an upward revision from the initial estimate of 
0.5%. Although growth was still weak, it was stronger than had been expected. 
</P>
<P>
The government said construction spending rose 1.8% in January, the biggest 
increase in more than a year. Some major chain stores reported good February 
sales growth. 
</P>
<P>
Interest rates rose Thursday, driving Treasury bond prices down, as traders 
interpreted the reports as fresh signs that the Federal Reserve will not ease 
credit soon. 
</P>
<P>
The market appeared to be little affected by another sharp drop in the volatile 
Japanese stock market. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's 225-share Nikkei index fell 
762.41, or 2.2%, to 33,829.58, reversing a 694-point gain Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts were uncertain as to how long any rally might last. Kidder Peabody's 
Jarrett predicted that the upward trend could last a month or two.

"That doesn't mean it goes straight up, but it's been a good week so far," he 
said. The Dow index has advanced more than 70 points so far this week, 
recovering last week's 71-point loss.

Harry Laubscher, technical analyst at Tucker Anthony, R. L. Day, said the 
market has given a short-term buy signal, but he expects a selloff soon that 
could continue through most of April. But "in May we expect a very good trading 
rally," he said.

Charles Jensen of MKI Securities noted that seasonal factors have buoyed 
stocks. He said pension funds generally pour new money into stocks on the last 
day of a month and in the first four days of the new month. He saw some 
rotation in the market as stocks that have been lagging the averages started to 
catch up.

Union Carbide was the most actively traded issue on the Big Board, falling 2 to 
22 1/4 after the company said it was not seeking to sell any of its core 
businesses, as had been rumored.

<P>
Digital Equipment fell 3 1/2 to 74 1/2 as rumors about a takeover bid by a 
Japanese company were dispelled.

<P>
Philadelphia Electric eased 2 1/8 to 18 after two Pennsylvania administrative 
law judges recommended a rate hike that was below expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount Communications rose 2 1/4 to 45. A Smith Barney analyst reiterated a 
buy rating on the stock, based partly on expectations that the company's summer 
movies will be well received. 
</P>
<P>
Shares of some retailers responded to strong February results. Wal-Mart rose 
5/8 to 44 5/8, J. C. Penney rose 3/8 to 66 1/4 and Woolworth climbed 1/2 to 60 
1/8.

In London, share prices finished lower after a dreary session on London's Stock 
Exchange, pushed down by a poor performance earlier in Tokyo and an uninspiring

Bond Prices Decline for Second Session 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices retreated broadly for the second consecutive session on signs of 
strength in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, which fell 7/8 point on Wednesday, 
dropped 3/4 point, or $7.50 for every $1,000 face amount. 
</P>
<P>
Its yield climbed to 8.60% from 8.53% late Wednesday. The bond yielded 8.44% 
late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the decline reflected a reaction to strong economic reports. A 
pickup in the economy could lead to stronger demand for credit, which would 
push interest rates higher and bond prices lower. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the economic numbers were relatively strong," said Robert Brusca, chief 
economist for Nikko Securities International in New York. 
</P>
<P>
He said the figures indicated that "there will be no easing soon, and the 
market is trying to come to grips with all of this." 
</P>
<P>
"The (purchasing managers) report raised expectations of a pickup in the 
economy," said Elliott Platt, who follows the bond markets for Donaldson Lufkin 
&amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. 
</P>
<P>
He said many analysts had expected little change in the index.

The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight

News on Economy Helps Boost Dollar

The dollar continued its climb against most major foreign currencies, boosted 
by the reports showing strength in the U.S. economy and by economic uncertainty 
in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Sloane, a currency futures analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; 
Co., said the reports "seemed to paint the picture that the economy is doing 
all right."

Traders said the Federal Reserve sold dollars in an attempt to halt the 
currency's rise against the yen, but the intervention appeared to have limited 
impact.

<P>
Americans started the 1990s with a healthy 0.8% rise in personal income in 
January, while growth in consumer spending slowed and a trend toward greater 
savings continued, the Commerce Department said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Personal income, which includes wages, salaries, interest, dividends and other 
items, rose a more modest 0.5% in December and stood at a $4.60-trillion annual 
rate in January. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending, meanwhile, rose more slowly than income, climbing 0.6% to a 
$3.60-trillion annual rate after a 1.0% rise in December, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the spending gain was for durable goods -- "big-ticket" items such as 
cars and appliances -- which soared 5.2% in January, the department said. 
Spending on services declined slightly. 
</P>
<P>
Despite January's rise in spending, which was largely the result of a one-month 
surge in car sales, economists said consumers appear to be curbing their 
outlays, which could slow the economy. Consumer spending accounts for about 
two-thirds of gross national product, the broadest measure of domestic economic 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
"I would expect weak GNP growth in the first quarter," said economist Kathryn 
Kobe at Joel Popkin &amp; Co. in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan recently told Congress that the 
worst of the economic slowdown was over. 
</P>
<P>
But the National Assn. of Purchasing Management said Thursday that the 
manufacturing sector of the economy continued to contract in February, though 
not as steeply as in previous months. 
</P>
<P>
Tax payments in January were reduced because of the annual "indexing" of 
federal income tax rates to inflation. 
</P>
<P>
But income was also held down by an $8.8-billion increase in social security 
tax payments, reflecting a rate increase, said Lawrence Hunter, a U.S. Chamber 
of Commerce economist. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be a kinder, gentler, no-new-taxes world in the rhetoric of 
politicians, but in the real world it is proving to be nasty and harsh on the 
income of American taxpayers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With tax payments down and income up, consumers' disposable, or after-tax, 
income rose 0.9% in January to a $3.93-trillion rate after a modest 0.4% gain 
in December. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers continued saving their money at an increasing rate, the department 
said. They put 5.9% of their disposable income into savings in January after 
saving 5.5% in December, it said. 
</P>
<P>
The savings rate has been climbing steadily from a 40-year low of 3.2% in 1987 
to 4.2% in 1988 and 5.5% last year. 
</P>
<P>
Many economists say the rate must return to its long-term average of about 6% 
to ease upward pressure on interest rates and stimulate business investment. 
</P>
<P>
Economists said an increasingly cautious, aging population, startled by the 
1987 stock market crash and declines in real estate values, is likely to 
continue to put more of its money into savings. 
</P>
<P>
"We are seeing an increase in the savings rate -- and one would have to say 
it's about time," said Popkin's Kobe. "Baby boomers are moving into an age 
group which tends to save more than younger people." 
</P>
<P>
The January increase in personal income included an $11.3-billion rise in 
private wages and salaries, all of which was in service and retail industries. 
Manufacturing payrolls declined in January, while government payrolls 
increased.

THOROUGHLY MODERN MADONNA; 
</P>
<P>
FASHION: THE WORLD'S MOST FAMOUS CHAMELEON IS ABOUT TO SLIP INTO THREE NEW 
LOOKS FOR THE '90S. COPYCATS TAKE NOTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA FOLEY, Foley, a free-lance writer, often contributes to the Times 
fashion pages. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Madonna watchers, get ready for another eyeful. The woman who has influenced 
the fashion scene more than anyone else in the '80s is about to reveal three -- 
that's right, three -- new looks. 
</P>
<P>
They are all dramatically different, but all basically blond. 
</P>
<P>
"If I have blond hair, I attract attention," Madonna says, after repeated 
switches between light and dark. "Dark hair is for those times when I want to 
be anonymous." 
</P>
<P>
She will unveil her first new image when "Blond Ambition," her world concert 
tour, begins this month. On stage she'll play a tarty blond, dressed in 
costumes that cross 1930s Berlin cabaret outfits with images from "A Clockwork 
Orange," the street-smart sci-fi movie made in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Each change of clothes is built around a bustle-skirted mini with a corset-like 
top designed by Marlene Stewart, who has worked with Madonna on her wardrobe 
through most of her musical incarnations. 
</P>
<P>
"My style is all about irony," explains the songstress, speaking from a 
reclining position on a bare mattress in a room cluttered with other people's 
clothes. She is in a Hollywood studio, resting between rehearsals for her world 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
Madonna's appearance reaffirms her love of contrasts. Except for her black 
fishnet hosiery she is dressed like one of the boys, in a hooded sweat shirt 
under a black denim jacket, shorts, boxer's shoes, and a leather cap worn 
backwards over her light, short hair. But physically, everything about her is 
entirely feminine. She has the complexion of a rose, her voice is a whisper, 
and she moves with the grace of a dancer. 
</P>
<P>
But Madonna wanna-be's would do well not to get too attached to the Blond 
Ambition look, because there's a blond bombshell hot on its vampy heels. In 
early June, Madonna will splash across the big screen as buttery-haired 
Breathless Mahoney, the love interest in the new "Dick Tracy" movie. 
</P>
<P>
She plays the '40s doll her way, of course, wearing Tracy's mall-brimmed fedora 
with her beaded, body- gripping gown. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Beatty portrays Dick Tracy, and for months now, the very public romance 
that blossomed during filming has been the talk of many towns. Late nights, 
Madonna and Beatty show up at Club Louie in Los Angeles. She dances with the 
crowd, he stands back to watch. 
</P>
<P>
Two new Madonnas would be enough. But there is a third one on the way. This is 
an icy blond from the pages of a '50s fashion magazine, a type created for 
"Vogue," the music video that will be released from the "Dick Tracy" sound 
track album. Madonna poses here as a cool mass of waves and curves, dressed in 
goddess gowns that cover everything but cling to almost all of it. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever will the fashion crowd do when their most active inspiration tosses 
them so many images at once? Already they have to hustle to keep up. Even Yves 
Saint Laurent succumbed to Madonna's lead this winter, with a new couture 
collection that is all about Monroe. Or is it all about Madonna playing Monroe? 
She's been updating the role for five years, since she imitated the dress, the 
voice and the hair, and called it "Material Girl," her hit song of 1985. 
</P>
<P>
And what will Jean Paul Gaultier make of the three new Madonnas? The hip French 
designer has had a fashion fling going with her since she starred in 
"Desperately Seeking Susan," her trend-setting movie of 1985. She wore black 
lace bras peeking out from beneath every outfit, and he showed fashion 
collections of underwear as outerwear, with tops that resembled long-line bras 
and bottoms that looked like girdles. Gaultier and Madonna keep trading off 
ideas (he designed several costumes for her Blond Ambition tour). And he is one 
of the few fashion big shots whose clothes she admits to wearing. 
</P>
<P>
Italy's Franco Moschino is another. "They have a sense of humor," she says 
about them. "I hate taking fashion and style seriously." 
</P>
<P>
While she inspires some of the biggest names in the clothing business, she says 
the people from the racially mixed neighborhood in Bay City, Mich., where she 
grew up, still inspire her. They knew her by her full name, Madonna Louise 
Veronica Ciccone, after her mother who died when Madonna was 6 years old. And 
she knew them as people with a flamboyant sense of style. "These people managed 
to look good without money," she recalls. She seems to pride herself on the 
fact that she still wears few designer labels. 
</P>
<P>
Without realizing it, her father influenced her fashion awareness, too. "My 
father would go crazy when I wore pants to church," she says of her strict 
Catholic upbringing. Seeing how potent a certain way of dress could be, she 
says, helped her develop what she refers to as "combinations of strictness and 
rebelliousness." Such Madonna fashion details as crucifix earrings and rosary 
bead necklaces were born of that awareness. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years she has constantly shifted fashion roles from toughie to 
temptress, mixing man-tailored suits with lace underwear, motorcycle jackets 
with tulle dresses and "Boy Toy" belt buckles. At first it was all by 
intuition. Now, she can explain it. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to cross the boundaries between men and women," she says. "That can be 
frightening, but the things I'm most affected by are things that frighten or 
challenge me." 
</P>
<P>
"I like to nudge people, to break through stereotypes. There are too many 
stereotypes. Even liberated women stay in certain categories; no one is too 
threatening." 
</P>
<P>
Madonna has surrounded herself with a trusted group of creative people who have 
worked with her from the beginning, yet rarely allow their names to be 
associated with hers. They all seem to want to stay in the background. 
</P>
<P>
In part that's because she expects to be the the only star in the group. But 
it's also because she has her own eclectic view, a collision of images from 
street fashions, ethnic dances and glamorous old movies that only she could 
combine. 
</P>
<P>
Her definite tastes don't always make her easy to work with. 
</P>
<P>
"She knows she's difficult," says Victor Vidal, one of her regular hair 
stylists. 
</P>
<P>
"But her saving grace is that being difficult is part of being honest, for her. 
She complains for a reason. It might be after 14 hours of rehearsal. She'll 
say, 'Let's get this done,' but everybody else feels the same way." 
</P>
<P>
Despite her strong point of view about absolutely everything, the people around 
her say she respects and trusts them, starting with her art director, 
29-year-old Christopher Ciccone, who is also one of her seven siblings and 
looks remarkably like her. 
</P>
<P>
"She calls me the 'tastemaker,' " Ciccone says. A painter who has worked 
closely with Madonna since the early '80s when she peddled her record demos to 
New York deejays, he is artistic director for the Blond Ambition tour. He is 
also responsible for the interior design of both her California home and her 
New York apartment. He describes both as spacious and serene, punctuated with 
important art. 
</P>
<P>
"She has her own vision, I offer her different ways of looking at things. Other 
people do, too, but it's different with us. We fight a lot, and either she wins 
or I win, but we don't let up. Neither of us is afraid to be direct, and 
Madonna has always known what she wants." 
</P>
<P>
Costume designer Stewart gives Madonna full credit for creating her distinctive 
clothing style. "She's an actress, not just a singer. For costumes she thinks 
in terms of story and character." 
</P>
<P>
Peter Savic, her other hair stylist, created Madonna's flirty hair styles for 
"Desperately Seeking Susan," and has worked steadily with her since then. He 
also designed her glamour girl styles for "Dick Tracy." 
</P>
<P>
Vidal made up the bleached, cropped, chopped look Madonna wore for her "True 
Blue" video in 1986. "I told her about this vision I had of her. I wanted to 
bleach her hair almost white and cut it short. She thought for a moment, said 
yes, picked up a magazine and never looked up until I was finished." 
</P>
<P>
Madonna's two makeup artists, Francesca Tolot and Joanne Gair both say she 
knows what she wants. Their only basic rules are to use deeper shades of color 
when her hair is dark, paler shades when she is blond. And they use less makeup 
now than ever before, because she wants a less painted look these days. But 
neither Tolot nor Gair takes credit for teaching her anything new. 
</P>
<P>
"She is aware of her face, she knows what looks good and what does not," says 
Gair. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987 Madonna added personal trainer Rob Parr to her inner circle. She works 
out with him for two hours daily. 
</P>
<P>
"She challenges herself more than I ever could," says Parr. "Our workouts often 
start at 5 in the morning, when she is filming. We work on stamina and 
endurance for her singing and dancing and we work on the shape of her body." 
</P>
<P>
"I work out for emotional reasons as well as physical," she says. "It makes me 
feel more in control. I can say to myself, 'At least I've accomplished one 
thing for the day.' " 
</P>
<P>
Photographer Herb Ritts and video director Mary Lambert are two others in 
Madonna's stable. 
</P>
<P>
Lambert directed "Material Girl," and "Like a Prayer," perhaps the most 
controversial of all Madonna's works so far, because of its martyr/victim 
overtones. 
</P>
<P>
"Madonna makes no effort to mask any of her feelings," says Lambert. "I think 
part of her appeal is that she personifies the way a lot of people want to be." 
</P>
<P>
Madonna relates that notion to clothes. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm in a bad mood I dress the way I feel," she says. All of a sudden an 
underlying toughness about her shows through and she turns defiant. "I don't 
comb my hair, I put on a cap, a leather jacket, jeans, a T-shirt. It works 
because I'm dressed the way I feel." 
</P>
<P>
Ritts met Madonna five years ago, while photographing an ad campaign for her 
movie, "Desperately Seeking Susan." 
</P>
<P>
"She strutted in dripping in rubber bracelets, crucifixes, carrying armloads of 
clothes and trinkets in a cigar box. I liked the definite way she felt about 
herself." 
</P>
<P>
Concerning the many faces of Madonna the world has seen since then, Ritts says, 
"Her attraction isn't about hair or makeup or clothes, it's about her evolution 
as a person." 
</P>
<P>
Truly, we've all watched her grow up, from the 20-year-old kid still reliving 
Catholic school days to Madonna the MTV star of the decade, the 31-year-old 
mogul in charge of her own music and movie career, who is said to earn $20 
million or more every year. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, including criticisms and counter-criticisms that she can't 
sing, can't act, can't keep her personal life together, no one has questioned 
her reputation as fashion's leading chameleon. And she is the one who decides 
when to change color. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to me to express myself, as an artist, as a woman, as a jerk if 
that's how I feel," she says, putting on a slick black, knee-grazing trench 
coat to go on to another rehearsal. "Nobody has done what I've done quite the 
way I've done it. I don't know what people will be saying about me in 50 years, 
but I know they'll be talking about me."

PERESTROIKA: A SOVIET INTELLECTUAL SAYS THE U. S. MUST TURN ITS ATTENTION FROM 
EVENTS IN THE SOVIET UNION AND DO A LITTLE SOUL-SEARCHING OF ITS OWN.

For Sergey Plekhanov, 1969 was his introduction to a freer form of enterprise 
on the dingier side of capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
Five Brooklyn teen-agers tried to mug him for his watch. 
</P>
<P>
Functioning more on naivete than nerve, Plekhanov told them it was a Russian 
watch. It was the only one of its kind in New York, he added, and therefore of 
little value to any fence. 
</P>
<P>
Impressed by his grasp of the economics of their trade, the Prospect Park 
roughs tossed a few rocks at Plekhanov and left man and watch intact. 
</P>
<P>
Plekhanov continues to impress others with his logic. 
</P>
<P>
Only these days, nobody throws rocks at Sergey Plekhanov -- deputy director of 
the Institute of U. S. and Canadian Studies at the U.S.S.R. Academy of 
Sciences, a television analyst and eloquent spokesman for the democratization 
of the Soviet Union. Not even when he suggests that, with the Soviet Union in 
freer, more peaceful order, it might be time for the United States to exercise 
a little perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever I look at statistics of American society, I see a lot of problems 
which are not solved, and a lot of needs that are not being met," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Plekhanov, 43, knows the essential arithmetic: $295 billion spent by the U.S. 
military in 1989; drug abuse that costs Ameri can taxpayers $200 billion a 
year; an embarrassing illiteracy rate; estimates of more than 1 million 
homeless Americans; and "crime . . . at a much higher level than it is in the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been observing America for 20 years now, and I do not see much progress 
toward solution of those problems. In 1970, when I first came to America, it 
seemed a better and more human place. Although I understand there have been 
some progressive changes, there has also been a regression in the way people 
think about the future of America." 
</P>
<P>
Interviewed after a 14-hour parade of cafeteria meetings with students and 
dinner presentations Tuesday to faculty and guests at UC Irvine, Plekhanov 
acknowledged that the history of the Soviet Union hasn't exactly been a bowl of 
caviar either. 
</P>
<P>
There was Stalin's corruption of Leninism and a dictatorship since proved 
murderous. Chernobyl has become an icon to nuclear negligence, and Plekhanov's 
debit list grows longer: "Persecution of dissidents . . . sending troops to 
Czechoslovakia, sending troops to Afghanistan . . . constraints on immigration, 
and not only Jewish immigration." 
</P>
<P>
But on the other side of the ruble, the U. S. traditionally spends more on 
public health than does the Soviet Union; the Soviet Union doesn't have the 
legacy of Vietnam; the United States has a better record on civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
"Having spent more than a year in New York, I recognize that maybe the United 
States has gone further in coming to grips with a multiracial society than any 
other country," Plekhanov said. "The prejudice is still there. But look at the 
practical experience of living side by side and actually overcoming that 
prejudice, squeezing it out of yourself. 
</P>
<P>
"For that, you need the right kind of a climate, and the civil rights movement, 
I think, was a powerful, liberating thing for the American psychology, for the 
American consciousness." 
</P>
<P>
Now, he believes, that consciousness could be redirected toward an American 
reformation. The nation, he feels, has lost much of its "very healthy . . . 
self-critical attitude" of the late '60s and early '70s. Priorities in federal 
funding remain heavily rooted in "artificial fears, . . . yesterday's agendas." 
</P>
<P>
"But we (in the Soviet Union) are having our perestroika," he continued. "We 
have started attacking the postulates of the old order in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"To some people, it is terrible. . . . They say: 'Oh, this is the end of 
everything because this is radical critique.' But radical critique is like 
surgery, which is necessary when you know that the roots of your disease 
require such a surgery." 
</P>
<P>
When Plekhanov, a graduate of the Moscow Institute of International Relations, 
first came to the United States, it was as an intern for the Soviet delegation 
to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
His stay produced a thesis on the birth and growth of American right-wing 
politics. It also saw development of a passion for the folk music of Pete 
Seeger, playing jazz piano in pursuit of Fats Waller and guitar after Wes 
Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
In the two decades since -- and after his knowledge of Seeger was considered 
credential enough for a junior research post with the Institute of U.S. and 
Canadian Studies -- only Stolichnaya vodka has visited more corners of America. 
</P>
<P>
Plekhanov was hired by CBS for last year's Malta Summit, playing analyst to Dan 
Rather's anchor. He was on Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's team of 
Soviet-American experts at the Geneva Summit. He goes back to CBS in June, when 
Gorbachev meets President George Bush in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The lighter Plekhanov wears Hungarian sport coats, Italian shirts, American 
silk neckties and Spanish slacks. "But the underwear is from the Soviet Union," 
he says. "It is very comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
He knows all the lyrics of Phil Ochs' "Talking Birmingham Jam" and interrupted 
this week's trip to San Diego for two hours of personal pleasure -- prowling 
the tall ship "Star of India." 
</P>
<P>
And his English is so American, so correct to vernacular, buzzwords and mild 
blasphemies, that his boss, Georgy Arbatov, once joked that institute workers 
suspect Plekhanov might be a CIA plant. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, these days, there is little time for fun, even less for a wife and two 
children in Moscow, as Plekhanov is courted heavily and internationally by 
those seeking his rare intellect for focusing a path through entangled 
superpowers. 
</P>
<P>
But even Plekhanov must rush to keep up. Tuesday's news of Gorbachev's proposal 
for a Western-style presidency had passed the Supreme Soviet and was a lunch 
question from his audience before Plekhanov had even heard details of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, he said, democratization was a topic that the wise dared not 
whisper in Moscow. On Sunday, the head of his institute was openly condemning 
Soviet defense expenditures and the futility of attempting political ends by 
military means in an article appearing in the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
Reduced military spending, Plekhanov believes, is key to future progress in 
both countries. "It is obscene for the United States and for the Soviet Union 
to spend so much and to continue to spend so much on defense against each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is a great contradiction of world politics. The Cold War is over, 
but the military budgets are still swollen and we are far too slow in bringing 
them down." 
</P>
<P>
So if there were a perestroika in the United States, he said, it would also 
mean "changing your foreign policy and the way you look at the outside world." 
</P>
<P>
Plekhanov also sees the United States on the cusp of a crisis. There was one in 
the Depression of the '20s and '30s, "but then came Roosevelt and the 
nationwide movement for change." The '70s produced the deep division of Vietnam 
and "a terrible racial problem, a problem of dissent and coping with dissent . 
. . not spending enough on social problems and spending too much on the war in 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"But you pulled out of that." 
</P>
<P>
The '80s and the Reagan era, he believes, created "the illusion . . . that just 
unshackling private initiative" would produce security and prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
"But you've woken up and the world is not as beautiful as it seemed. It turns 
out that many problems have not been solved and many new problems have been 
created, and suddenly the heroes of the Reagan boom are winding up in jail or 
in bankruptcy court." 
</P>
<P>
Concurrently, domestic industry is being crippled by economic competition from 
overseas. The need now, he said, is for the United States to break loose from 
"a tremendous under-investment in human capital. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to become competitive, you have to invest much more in human 
beings in order to retrain the labor force, in order to find new incentives to 
improve productivity." 
</P>
<P>
Then, he said, the United States will be better equipped to join the world 
against a new threat of extinction from global deterioration of the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
Whether nuclear testing in the Pacific in 1946 or malathion spraying in Los 
Angeles in 1990, Plekhanov said, "scientists have led us down the garden path" 
into a "sacred belief in progress and that they are so smart." 
</P>
<P>
Also to blame are "a lot of people who think that producing wealth, producing 
goods and services, becoming powerful in terms of economic power, is the most 
important thing." 
</P>
<P>
His own children, he noted, have developed allergies never suffered by their 
parents. Could it be that in conception, he asked, mother and father 
transferred "some poisons . . . because we drank the wrong kind of water, we 
breathed the wrong kind of air or ate the wrong kind of fruits and meats?" 
</P>
<P>
"The best brains, the most committed people and a great sense of outrage" will 
be required to cease, much less resolve such problems, he said, adding that his 
personal proposal is to divert money from the Soviet-American arms race and 
invest them "into ecology-saving technologies, into joint actions to stop this 
murder of the planet. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see us Russians become leaders in a worldwide green movement, 
if only because the ecological crisis is very severe in the Soviet Union. The 
greening of the Soviet Union. That's what we need." 
</P>
<P>
But his concern about modern foods, the environment and humanity would not 
extend to a ban on Moscow's newest attraction -- a McDonalds restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Plekhanov does not see Beeg Mak Gamburgers as an intrusion of capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
"Fast food for the masses," he said. "Pure Leninism. McDonalds should have been 
there in 1920."

<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Ferrigno vividly recalls the late nights nearly four years ago when he 
would retreat to Alamitos Bay in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Jody, was bedridden, suffering complications during her pregnancy 
with their son, Jake. As a way of coping with his "incredible feeling of 
helplessness," Ferrigno would slip out of their warm Belmont Shore apartment 
after she was asleep and swim in the cold, dark bay. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though they both pulled out of it, and they're both fine, it gave me a 
very powerful sense that life is fleeting," said Ferrigno, 42. "It made me 
realize I had been talking and thinking about writing a book for a long time, 
but I should probably not count on having the rest of my life to finish it." 
</P>
<P>
Ferrigno used the late-night swims, "as a way to strengthen my resolve: I will 
not drown, not in this water and not in the events that were overtaking my 
life. If I can force myself to hit the water -- I can do anything." 
</P>
<P>
So he began rising at 4 a.m. each day to work on "The Horse Latitudes" -- a 
noir Southern California morality tale of sex, drugs and money -- before going 
to work as a feature writer for the Orange County Register. Then he would 
return to his bedroom personal computer in the evening after his infant son was 
asleep. 
</P>
<P>
After 18 months of existing on roughly four hours of sleep a night and with his 
marriage threatened by his compulsive overwork, Ferrigno -- at his wife's 
urging -- quit his newspaper job to devote full time to finish his first novel. 
</P>
<P>
The gamble -- not out of character for a man who spent six years in the '70s 
playing poker for a living in Seattle -- paid off. Handsomely. 
</P>
<P>
Within four months of quitting his job in 1988, the hardcover and paperback 
rights to Ferrigno's incomplete novel were sold to William Morrow &amp; 
Co./Avon for an impressive $150,000 advance. Sales to eight foreign countries 
have earned him nearly $250,000 more and a movie deal is pending. 
</P>
<P>
Early reviews of "The Horse Latitudes," a Book-of-the-Month-Club featured 
alternate for March, praise the romantic thriller. Publishers Weekly labeled 
Ferrigno's first novel "impressive," noting that it is "a perfect escape into 
quirky, sunny, sexy postmodern suspense." 
</P>
<P>
Set on the coast between Long Beach and Newport Beach, "The Horse Latitudes" is 
about retired marijuana wholesaler Danny DiMedici, who is still carrying a 
torch for his beautiful ex-wife, Lauren Kiel, a wealthy corporate psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
When Lauren turns up missing, after the mutilated body of a research scientist 
is found hanging in her blood-splattered Newport Beach living room, Danny sets 
out to find his ex-wife. In the process, he must re-enter the seamy underworld 
he thought he had left behind. 
</P>
<P>
"The Horse Latitudes" refers to an area of the Atlantic Ocean where the trade 
winds die, causing the old sailing ships on their way to the New World to stand 
dead in the water. To get under way, sailors would lighten the ships by 
throwing part of their cargo overboard. During the most severe doldrums, they 
would abandon their most precious cargo -- horses. 
</P>
<P>
The novel's title, Ferrigno explained, is a metaphor for Danny DiMedici. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I see it, my guy is frozen in time and for him to get under way, he's 
going to have to get rid of a lot of emotional baggage," said Ferrigno, whose 
anti-hero, appropriately, is found taking a midnight swim in Alamitos Bay when 
the novel opens. As Ferrigno writes, "He was going to drown one of these 
nights, or he was going to get over her -- it was too early to tell which." 
</P>
<P>
It's the amoral, highly erotic Lauren who has intrigued many reviewers. 
</P>
<P>
"Her very amorality is what gives her part of her erotic charge," said 
Ferrigno, who says he once dated a woman like Lauren. "I mean she's incendiary 
precisely because of that evil component to her. She is dangerous. You touch 
her at your own risk. I think that's part of her appeal to Danny. He doesn't 
like 'safe and sane' fireworks. He likes the stuff that will blow up in your 
hand if you don't handle them carefully." 
</P>
<P>
For a coming issue of Mademoiselle magazine, three male novelists have been 
asked to write about their "dream girls." 
</P>
<P>
Ferrigno wrote about Lauren. 
</P>
<P>
Single until he was 36, Ferrigno no longer leads the kind of exotic life he 
embraced in the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
The Florida-born writer, who earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy and a 
master's in creative writing, moved to Seattle after graduate school in 1971. 
He landed a job teaching English and literature at community colleges but quit 
after two years. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't really like it and I felt like I needed to get my hands dirty," he 
said. "I had been in school my whole life and I wanted to experience a 
non-academic environment." 
</P>
<P>
He moved from his "nice little neighborhood" in the university district to a 
high-crime area in downtown Seattle where he lived in a two-room apartment, 
"with a bathroom down the hall," and started playing "serious poker" for a 
living. 
</P>
<P>
For Ferrigno, who paid for college and graduate school with his poker earnings, 
it was a natural career move. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked the life," he said. "It was very interesting, very intense -- I used 
to get psyched up before the game -- and I liked the hours. You didn't get 
rich, but you always had cash." 
</P>
<P>
One of Ferrigno's neighbors was a young Cuban refugee named Armando, an 
ex-convict who sold heroin out of his window to customers who lined up on the 
sidewalk. Armando served as the model for Cubanito, the drug dealer in "The 
Horse Latitudes." 
</P>
<P>
"In a lot of ways, the criminal environment I was in was very comfortable to 
me," said Ferrigno. "Things were very direct, very up front. And I didn't make 
moral judgments about a lot of the people I hung out with." 
</P>
<P>
He said he wrote his novel, in part, to help understand his own past. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to try to imagine why do I still think of those people as my friends? 
And why do I have trouble connecting with the day-to-day regular world?" 
</P>
<P>
He concedes he is no longer comfortable in the criminal world. "I went back to 
my old neighborhood in Seattle a couple of years ago and it scared the hell out 
of me. I don't belong there any more. I'd get eaten there in an hour." 
</P>
<P>
Ferrigno said there is a lot of himself in Danny DiMedici. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the brink is very seductive to Danny and very seductive to me," he 
said. "There is an eroticism to being that close to the edge and knowing how 
easy it would be to let go of that little bit and to not do it. I derive 
something from not doing it." 
</P>
<P>
After six years of playing poker in pick-up games with everyone from lawyers to 
hustlers, Ferrigno wrote a free-lance review of a photographic exhibit for a 
Seattle alternative weekly newspaper. When he saw his first newspaper byline, 
he was hooked. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an intensity in coming home at 4 in the morning and throwing a couple 
of thousand dollars on your bed and throwing it in the air (and saying), I won 
all of it! But that wasn't even close to getting $10 for an article with your 
name on it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Recalling those days when he was working on his novel in his free time while 
holding down a full-time newspaper job, Ferrigno said he would wake up "before 
4 and my brain would be on fire. It wasn't like I was even tired. My wife 
finally said, 'If you don't quit your job things aren't going to work out' 
because I was becoming a less than pleasant person." 
</P>
<P>
Jody Ferrigno, who had read every draft of each chapter, "had total belief" 
that his novel would sell. "She said, 'It's too good. Someone will buy this.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Ferrignos' lives haven't changed dramatically since Ferrigno sold "The 
Horse Latitudes." Their biggest concession to his literary windfall was buying 
a four-bedroom, lake-front house next to Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
But they're renting out their new house and continue to live in their 
'40s-vintage two-bedroom apartment in Belmont Shore where Ferrigno is working 
on his next novel. 
</P>
<P>
And three mornings a week he teaches a basic reporting class at Cal State 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Like writing a story for the newspaper, Ferrigno believes, a novelist should 
not waste any time in attracting the reader's attention. 
</P>
<P>
"I figure if I can catch you for the first page I've got good odds. And again, 
I'm a good poker player. All I need is good odds."

DESIGNERS GET INTO THE TRENCHES FOR SPRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CINDY LaFAVRE YORKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This week, department stores are filling up with the latest must-have: the 
short trench coat. 
</P>
<P>
We're not talking about utility wear. These are knee-grazing, colorful items 
with full skirts set off by snugly belted waists that have less to do with 
weather conditions than of-the-moment fashion. European designers, including 
Gianfranco Ferre for Christian Dior, Claude Montana and Martine Sitbon for 
Chloe, all show trench coats in their spring collections. As do such 
young-spirited New Yorkers as Isaac Mizrahi, Adrienne Vittadini and Marc Jacobs 
for Perry Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
Mizrahi's coats are vibrant orange. Vittadini went in for a blue plaid version. 
Marc Jacobs for Perry Ellis enlivened his belted trench with a marigold color 
tone. 
</P>
<P>
The look works well with the Los Angeles climate, says Gail Sekiguchi, fashion 
director for Nordstrom Southern California. Customers at her store are picking 
up on the short trench as an accent piece for their wardrobes, primarily 
because it is an ideal topper for cool evenings and it is light enough to be 
worn as a jacket, or even as a dress, by day. 
</P>
<P>
New York designer Donna Karan considers the DKNY short trench coat to be a 
fashion basic for spring, whether it's raining or not. 
</P>
<P>
"Donna considers it as basic as jeans for this season," her spokeswoman, Patti 
Cohen, says. Cohen has definite ideas about how to wear the new fashion item. 
</P>
<P>
"You can dress the short trench up or down. It looks good with pants or alone, 
belted over a full skirt, or unbelted over skinny pants or leggings. You can 
even wear them over bathing suits." She also points out that the length is more 
flattering than ankle-length coats on shorter women. 
</P>
<P>
Karan also added a short cotton poplin trench, shown cinched with a real 
alligator belt, to her pricier signature collection for summer. 
</P>
<P>
Some believe the look will really take off after the summer season. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that it is as major a look for spring as it will be later, moving 
forward into fall," says Sekiguchi, explaining that it takes time for a trend 
to catch on.

THE FRENCHWOMAN WHO DELIVERED A BIG 'BABY' TO HOLLYWOOD; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: HER 'THREE MEN AND A CRADLE' WAS TURNED INTO YOU KNOW WHAT. NOW SHE 
HOPES LIGHTNING WILL STRIKE TWICE WITH 'MAMA, THERE'S A MAN IN YOUR BED.' 
</P>

<P>
With "Mama, There's a Man in Your Bed," which opens the Santa Barbara 
International Film Festival tonight, French writer-director Coline Serreau may 
have another international hit on her hands. Serreau's "Three Men and a 
Cradle," remade as "Three Men and a Baby" by Disney, was such a big success -- 
in both versions -- that Disney's Hollywood Pictures has signed her to both 
direct an English remake of "Mama" and then to write and direct a sequel. 
</P>
<P>
It's no wonder that Disney came calling. "Three Men" and "Mama" are both 
big-laugh comedies with universal themes. But you don't need to wait for the 
American version; in both cases, Serreau got it right the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"Mama" is an offbeat romantic comedy about the relationship between Romuald, a 
harried Paris yogurt mogul (Daniel Auteuil), and Juliette, the black cleaning 
lady (Firmine Richard) who helps him trap the traitors in his midst. 
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old Serreau said the idea for "Mama," which bears the title 
"Romuald et Juliette" in Europe, came to her while she was in California 
preparing "Three Men and a Baby." 
</P>
<P>
"It's more of an American film than a French film, really," Serreau said, 
during a recent interview at a Venice cafe. "Black culture is not as important 
in France as it is in America. Yet, the relationship between the races here is 
so complex, so much a love/hate thing. Ask a Middle American his favorite TV 
show and he'll say 'Bill Cosby.' And who's the biggest star? Eddie Murphy. It's 
crazy!

"I wrote the first 10 lines for 'Romuald and Juliette' here and the rest in 
France. I was working on another movie, but I became obsessed with 'Romuald and 
Juliette' and asked my producers if we could do it instead. I was lucky; they 
agreed. I don't know how Disney got hold of the script, but they wanted to buy 
it. It's still a mystery to me how they got the script!" 
</P>
<P>
The working title for the Disney remake is "Randall and Juliet." Richard 
Dreyfuss will play Randall, Juliet is yet to be cast. It will mark Serreau's 
American directorial debut. 
</P>
<P>
"I was supposed to direct 'Three Men and a Baby,' " she said, "but I got sick 
and had to go back to Paris only three or four weeks before we were to start 
shooting, so I couldn't do it." (Serreau is not involved in the sequel, "Three 
Men and a Little Lady," but she admits with a certain satisfaction that she has 
a share of its profits.) 
</P>
<P>
Serreau brings to film making an extraordinarily rich and varied background. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother was a writer, a novelist, essayist and playwright. My father was an 
avant-garde director who presented Brecht, Ionescu and Beckett -- he introduced 
'Waiting for Godot' and Beckett was a family friend. So I was kind of born in 
the theater, but by the time I was a teen-ager I had had enough of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a pianist and organist for awhile, but I was eventually pulled back to 
the theater. I acted a lot, I wrote, and when the wonderful Fratollini Circus 
opened a school I went there the first day. I learned to work on the trapeze. I 
may not be gifted at other things, but I am very good at that! As an actress, I 
was always concerned with the physical aspects. 
</P>
<P>
"At 13, I started writing and wrote all the time. It was never 'Today, I decide 
to be a writer.' I wrote two successful plays, one a success in Paris, the 
other in Geneva. I never thought that what I wrote should be directed by anyone 
but me! I like to tell stories. Writing is like an instinct with me. It's not 
calculated; people should stop writing if they have to work hard at it. They 
should stay away, it's no good for them. The one thing that makes great movies 
is a great script." 
</P>
<P>
It was just 10 years ago that Serreau's first film, a menage a trois comedy 
starring Sami Frey called "Why Not?," opened in Los Angeles. It showed more 
promise than fulfillment, but it did display a quirky, fresh sensibility and it 
did try to validate unconventional relationships in a crazy world. 
</P>
<P>
Serreau says Charlie Chaplin is her idol. 
</P>
<P>
"There are not many directors whose work I like," she says, "and he is the only 
one I really, really admire. His films are beautiful -- they are always telling 
us so many things about life. Like Shakespeare and Moliere, he was an actor. 
The really great directors were actors, they know how to deal with an audience. 
What I like here in America is that it is normal for an actor to be physical -- 
it doesn't all come out of the brain. The purely cerebral is often just so much 
masturbation. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to do a silent film, I'm fed up with words," she said, adamantly. "I 
already have the script, I've been working on it for 10 years. Maybe it's the 
last movie I'll ever make, I don't know."

EIGHT WORLD PREMIERES SET AT FILM FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The fifth Santa Barbara Film Festival, today through March 11, will present 
more than 75 films in 10 days, including eight world premieres, plus workshops, 
seminars and tributes to actor Rod Steiger, veteran animator Chuck Jones and 
Kenneth Branagh , star and director of the new "Henry V." 
</P>
<P>
There will be a special series of nine new or recent French pictures, starting 
with Coline Serreau's comedy, "Mama, There's a Man in Your Bed," the festival's 
opening-night attraction. Daniel Auteuil stars as a yogurt magnate who 
discovers traitors within with the aid of one of his company's cleaning women 
(Firmine Richard). 
</P>
<P>
The festival closes March 11 with Giuseppe Tornatore's "Cinema Paradiso." 
</P>
<P>
Among the other French films are "Un Amour Interdit" with Fernando Rey and 
Brigitte Fossey; "Australia," with Jeremy Irons and Fanny Ardant; "La Fille de 
Quinze Ans," in which Jacques Doillon stars as well as directs, and composer 
Michel Legrand's autobiographical "Five Days in June," which marks his 
directorial debut. 
</P>
<P>
John Waters' "Cry Baby," billed as a "juvenile delinquent musical comedy love 
story" and starring Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder, heads a lineup of 10 
independent American features that also includes Ghasem Ebrahimian's "The 
Suitors," a haunting film about a young Iranian widow's painful odyssey of 
self-discovery in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Among the films from England are Carlos Sorin's comedy "Eversmile, New Jersey," 
starring Daniel Day-Lewis as an American dentist promoting dental hygiene in 
Patagonia, and Mel Smith's romantic comedy "The Tall Guy," starring Jeff 
Goldblum and Emma Thompson. From Australia there's the thriller "Georgia," 
starring Judy Davis, and from the Philippines Lino Brocka's "Macho Dancer."

TOKYO ENSEMBLE TO OPEN CALARTS FESTIVAL; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: GROUP PLAYS TO THE 'NEW TRADITION' OF CONTEMPORARY COMPOSITIONS FOR 
TRADITIONAL JAPANESE INSTRUMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
There may not be much in the way of contemporary music scheduled for the 
Pacific-themed Los Angeles Festival in September, but other presenters are 
making up the difference. The CalArts Festival of Contemporary Music this 
weekend, for example, is actually subtitled "Contemporary Music of the Pacific 
Rim." 
</P>
<P>
"We knew about the L.A. Festival theme," said Alan Chaplin, acting dean of the 
CalArts School of Music. "We consider our effort complementary, not 
competitive." 
</P>
<P>
The idea of orienting the 1990 CalArts festival around a Pacific theme goes 
back two years, when Chaplin and the school wrote their first grant proposal 
for this event, for the California Arts Council. "A Pacific Rim theme seemed to 
be very much in keeping with the current thinking at CalArts about the kind of 
multicultural world in which we live," Chaplin said. 
</P>
<P>
The festival gained its headliner almost by accident, however. Opening the 
festival tonight is the Tokyo International Music Ensemble. Directed by 
composer-pianist Toshi Ichiyanagi, the ensemble is devoted to the "new 
tradition" of contemporary compositions for traditional Japanese instruments, 
some in combination with Western classical instruments. 
</P>
<P>
The ensemble -- 13 performers plus a manager and stage assistants -- was formed 
specifically for its current tour, which began on the East Coast. With funding 
from a Japanese government agency for the tour already in place, CalArts was 
quite receptive when approached about scheduling a performance. "They fit in 
just perfectly, by coincidence," Chaplin reported. 
</P>
<P>
The program includes works by John Cage, Toshio Hosokawa, Yoshihiro Kanno, Toru 
Takemitsu, Ichiyanagi and Maki Ishii. On Saturday the ensemble moves to the 
Japan America Theatre for a similar program, though the JAT agenda includes the 
local premiere of Ichiyanagi's "Michi (The Way)," a piece incorporating 
gagaku-style dance and music. 
</P>
<P>
In May, ensemble members harpist Ayako Shinozaki and koto player Kazue Sawai 
return with other Japanese performers for the East Meets West-themed Fifth 
Chamber Music/LA Festival at the Japan America Theatre. There, the featured 
composers include Ichiyanagi, Takemitsu and Ishii, plus Isao Matsuhita and 
Tadao Sawai. On April 24, flutist Michiko Akao and members of the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic play other works by Ishii, Takemitsu and Joji Yuasa, on an "Under 
Grand Music" program at the Museum of Contemporary Art. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the CalArts programming is Japanese. Saturday afternoon the bill 
lists music by Chinese and Australian composers, as well as Californians. 
Saturday evening the program features the premieres of hybrid works for chorus, 
gamelan and percussion ensemble by CalArts faculty members -- John Bergamo's 
"Five Haiku," K.R.T. Wasitodinigrat's "Sapta Swara" and Barry Schrader's Tian 
An Men Square tribute "TWO: Square Flowers Red: SONGS." 
</P>
<P>
The chorus for that concert is Cantinova, an ensemble that premiered last 
December in CalArts-sponsored concerts at the Santa Monica Museum of Art. It is 
directed by Paul Vorwerk, who teaches at CalArts. Unlike most of the members of 
other resident ensembles, however, the Cantinova choristers are professionals, 
not students. Though providing its students with vocal ensemble experience, 
CalArts no longer has a voice major program. 
</P>
<P>
"We're gradually increasing our enrollment from the low-water mark, two or 
three years ago," Chaplin said. "Our philosophy of performance study is that 
students should play along with faculty." 
</P>
<P>
The Sunday afternoon program lists pieces by Julio Estrada and Lou Harrison, 
and the premiere of Nyoman Wenten's "Under Current," which merges jazz, 
Balinese gamelan and dance elements. There is a retrospective character to the 
Sunday evening finale, which begins and ends with works by Pauline Oliveros and 
Morton Subotnick that premiered on earlier festivals. 
</P>
<P>
This year the festival is actually a subset of a larger Spring Music Festival, 
which also features campus groups in an all-day "Jazz for the 21st-Century" 
program March 31 and world music components on two weekends in April. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of an umbrella thing we decided to do this year," Chaplin said. Next 
year may be different, but the current Spring Music Festival celebrates the 
school's 20th anniversary with "the integration of one viewpoint. I hope it's 
going to be both a challenging and pleasurable experience."

HOME TECH / VIDEOS: FOREIGN-LANGUAGE FILM SUPPLY LAGGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Home-video enthusiasts know that most movies currently playing in theaters will 
be available to them on cassette within five months to a year. Unless it's a 
foreign-language film they want to see. 
</P>
<P>
In the giant home-video business, foreign-language films are a small, 
specialized division. Even if a foreign-language film is fairly well publicized 
and gets some critical acclaim, there's no guarantee that it will ever show up 
on cassette in this country -- or, if it does, that video retailers will stock 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analyst Dick Kelly, of Cambridge Associates, explained that there's 
been limited research in this area but estimated that foreign-language films 
constitute just 0.5% of the home-video market. 
</P>
<P>
A foreign film that generates orders from retailers and distributors of between 
15,000 and 50,000 units is considered to be a big seller, said Orion Video 
executive Paul Wagner, whereas hit domestic movies sell hundreds of thousands 
of copies. 
</P>
<P>
The foreign films that do make it to home video tend to have what Wagner calls 
a high recognition factor. 
</P>
<P>
"If they have a famous director or cast members, or if they're very 
well-publicized, they're easier to sell to retailers," he explained. "Films 
that get Oscar recognition are more marketable also. Films that are obscure may 
be excellent but they'll be tough to market; they probably won't make it to 
video." 
</P>
<P>
Orion is the only major video company that releases foreign films on a regular 
basis. Its recent releases include Italy's "Devil in the Flesh," Spain's "Women 
on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown" and France's "Chocolat." 
</P>
<P>
Explaining why the majors are so uninterested in the market, retailer Meir Hed, 
whose Videotheque chain is noted for its large foreign-film inventory, 
explained: "They're too busy with hit American movies. They don't seem to care 
about the foreign-film market. It's too small for them to be concerned with." 
</P>
<P>
So the active players in the market are small companies like New Yorker, 
Connoisseur, Corinth, Cinematheque Collection and Video Yesteryear, which don't 
have the resources to give foreign-language films much exposure. 
</P>
<P>
Some industry observers feel that because of subtitles, which are difficult to 
see on small screens and are annoying to many people, foreign-language films 
will never be a major factor in the American home-video market. These observers 
think that dubbed films would get a better reception. 
</P>
<P>
Orion, though, conducted a study that shot down this myth. "It showed that 
people favor subtitles 9-1," Wagner reported. 
</P>
<P>
Why don't most video stores carry foreign films? 
</P>
<P>
"Most retailers stock what's most popular, which means the most recent movies," 
Hed said. "Smaller stores have limited space. They want to stock what does the 
best business. In small towns, there's not much of a market for foreign films 
on video. If you're a (Ingmar) Bergman fan and you live in Iowa, you're in 
trouble." 
</P>
<P>
This idea that there is a limited market for foreign-language films outside Los 
Angeles and New York may also be a myth, Wagner maintained. 
</P>
<P>
Orion conducted a three-month study of rental activity in selected stores in 
493 small cities, supplying foreign-language films to those that didn't usually 
carry them. The results showed that 83% of stores not only wanted to continue 
to stock those films but also indicated that they'd buy additional 
foreign-language films, Wagner said. 
</P>
<P>
"It shows there's an audience out there for foreign-language films that needs 
to be cultivated," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Because foreign-language films are so hard to find, mail-order companies such 
as Home Film Festival have stepped in to fill the void. A rent-by-mail firm, 
Home Film Festival (at (800) 258-3456) offers about 1,300 titles -- 
approximately 65% of which are foreign-language films.

PACS MAKE A REPRESENTATIVE SHOWING IN O.C. 
</P>

<P>
Three Orange County congressmen rank among California's top recipients of 
political contributions from the energy and health-care industries, according 
to a new study by Common Cause. 
</P>
<P>
However, the study indicates that Orange County lawmakers rely less heavily 
than most congressmen on special interest money. It also shows that political 
action committee contributions to the county's conservative Republican 
delegation came almost exclusively from business groups. 
</P>
<P>
The Common Cause report analyzed contributions made by political action 
committees -- called PACs -- to California's 45-member congressional delegation 
from 1983 through 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"What it shows is the extraordinary extent that special interest . . . money is 
involved in congressional campaign financing," said Common Cause President Fred 
Wertheimer. "The lobbying groups that put up the money to finance these 
campaigns are getting special advantages over the average voter." 
</P>
<P>
Common Cause is backing several measures that would restrict PAC contributions. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, Reps. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) and Robert K. 
Dornan (R-Garden Grove) ranked sixth and eighth, respectively, on the list of 
California representatives who received financial support from the energy 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan, however, was near the bottom of the list of overall PAC money 
recipients, when the contributions were calculated as a percentage of their 
total campaign contributions. In dollar terms, though, he was in the middle 
tier, with a total of $400,582 from PACs. 
</P>
<P>
Health-care political action committees contributed heavily to Dannemeyer and 
Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), who represents southern Orange County. 
Dannemeyer ranked seventh on the list of top health PAC recipients, while 
Packard finished in eighth place. 
</P>
<P>
A strong advocate of offshore oil drilling, Dannemeyer is a member of two key 
subcommittees of the House Energy and Commerce Committee -- the energy and 
power subcommittee and the panel on health and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer received $63,500 in contributions from energy PACs during the period 
of the study, including contributions from Standard Oil of California, Shell 
Oil Co., Mobil Corp. and Exxon Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Although Packard does not serve on any health-related committees, he is a 
former dentist and one of the few health professionals in Congress. Between 
1983 and 1988, the American Medical Assn. and the American Dental Assn. alone 
contributed nearly $34,000 to his campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan is not a member of any energy-related committees, but he has supported 
offshore oil drilling in the past. In an interview Thursday, he said he is 
tempering that position in light of the overall reduction in global tensions in 
recent months. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm able to move closer to the position of a (Sen.) Pete Wilson," who opposes 
oil drilling off the California coast, Dornan said. "The issue of our 
dependence on foreign oil is not nearly as critical as it was six months ago." 
</P>
<P>
On the issue of special-interest contributions, Dannemeyer said: "There's no 
doubt in my mind that those of us who serve in the legislative arena will have 
our voting records analyzed, and if we vote consistently with the concerns of a 
particular industry, they're going to help us. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether or not the prospect for support is going to influence how any of us 
vote, I don't make that step in my thinking. There is an appearance, perhaps, 
of a connection. In my case, it doesn't exist," Dannemeyer added. 
</P>
<P>
Packard said he does not emphasize fund raising and is comfortable as long as 
he relies more heavily on individual contributions than on money from political 
action committees. He said he would not object to limits on PAC contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan said he could support legislation limiting the influence of political 
action committees. However, he said he opposes the existing laws which limit 
contributions from individuals. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's limiting freedom of speech to limit individual citizens," Dornan 
said, "but PACs, I don't care what the limitation is, up to and including 
abolition." 
</P>
<P>
The issue of PAC money perhaps is less volatile in Orange County because Orange 
County congressmen generally are less dependent on political action committees 
than the rest of their California colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan, who collected only 10% of his 1983-1988 political contributions from 
PACs, ranked 42nd out of 44 in terms of the percentage of his dependence on 
special interest money. (Rep. Gary Condit who won office in a special election 
in 1989, was not included in the study.) 
</P>
<P>
Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) took in 17% of his total 
contributions from PACs, putting him in 40th place. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher 
(R-Lomita), who represents northwestern Orange County, finished 32nd, taking 
34% of his money from PACs. Packard placed 26th, with PACs contributing 42% of 
his total, while Dannemeyer followed in 25th place, with PACs accounting for 
44% of his contributions. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of actual dollars contributed by PACs in the five-year period, Dornan 
finished 22nd, with PAC contributions of $400,582, followed by Dannemeyer, in 
23rd place, with $380,167. Packard placed 27th, with $338,392. Cox and 
Rohrabacher, who both were first elected in 1988, finished 41st and 42nd, with 
respective totals of $190,648 and $175,074.

LEGISLATOR RAISED $58,429 TO FIGHT FORGERY CHARGES

Assemblyman John L. Lewis (R-Orange) raised $58,429 last year from fellow 
legislators, trade groups, car dealers, hamburger magnate Carl Karcher and 
others to pay for his legal defense against political forgery charges, 
according to his economic interest form filed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, a millionaire, faced felony charges of forging former President Ronald 
Reagan's name on 1986 campaign literature for Republican Assembly candidates 
despite the White House's express refusal to endorse the mailers. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 23, a state appellate court in Sacramento threw out the criminal 
charges, saying Lewis did not deprive anyone of property or money even if he 
ordered the use of the phony presidential signature. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general's office has appealed the ruling to the state Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's report shows that five of Lewis' current and former Republican 
colleagues rallied to his legal defense, chipping in $25,800 from their 
political campaign funds during 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Leading in legislative largess were Orange County Assemblyman Dennis Brown 
(R-Los Alamitos), whose committee gave $9,900, and former Assemblyman Bill 
Duplissea of San Carlos, whose political chest kicked in a matching $9,900. 
</P>
<P>
Others included Assembly Minority Leader Ross Johnson (R-La Habra), $4,000; 
Assemblyman Eric Seastrand (R-Salinas), $1,000, and Assemblyman William P. 
Baker (R-Danville), $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Trade groups or politically active organizations that also helped out included 
the National Rifle Assn.'s Institute for Legislative Action in Washington, 
which gave $500; the Mortgage Brokers Institute, $500; the Pacific Merchant 
Shipping Assn., $500, and the Dental Plan Administrators, $2,000. Carl Karcher 
Enterprises of Anaheim also gave Lewis $500. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis could not be reached for comment Thursday.

STATE DOCTORS GROUP ASKED TO CONSIDER SPRAYING HALT

<P>
Three Southland physicians have asked the California Medical Assn. to consider 
a resolution that calls for the termination of malathion spraying until safety 
concerns have been assessed. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution, which is scheduled to be discussed by the CMA's executive board 
today at the start of the group's annual meeting at the Disneyland Hotel, 
alleges that the state has not proven that the pesticide used to eradicate the 
Mediterranean fruit fly is safe. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George "Deukmejian seems more concerned with fruit flies than with 
humans," said H. Rex Greene, a Pasadena physician who along with two other 
doctors introduced the resolution. "The state has not shown (malathion) to be 
safe. If it's not shown to be safe, they have no business dumping it on 
citizens." 
</P>
<P>
The one-page resolution cites "acknowledged data gaps" in federal and state 
studies of malathion risks, asks if spraying contributes to ground-water 
contamination and points out that Japan has banned the use of the chemical. 
</P>
<P>
The statement calls for the "immediate halt to aerial malathion spraying" and 
asks the other 38,000 members of the medical association to write letters to 
elected officials demanding that spraying be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Wessell, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Health, said Thursday 
that she had not heard about the resolution and could not comment about 
specific parts of it. However, she did compare the resolution to other failed 
legislative and court actions taken by Southern California cities to halt 
spraying. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is doing that. What's so different about that?" Wessell asked. "They 
have a . . . hysteria going on." 
</P>
<P>
The CMA's executive board will decide whether the resolution warrants being 
heard at the association's annual meeting.

DIANNE KLEIN: SOS SENDS THE MESSAGE: THE POOR ARE IN OUR BACK YARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANNE KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The poor are not like us. Or so many of us like to think. 
</P>
<P>
The poor, I hear, bring crime and trash to otherwise pristine neighborhoods, 
places with lawns and driveways and sliding glass doors around the back. 
</P>
<P>
The poor lurk, it is said. They spread fear. 
</P>
<P>
The charities who try to help them -- as opposed to us -- can make things 
worse, I've also heard it said. They attract all sorts of people, the 
down-and-out from someplace else. They bring noise and traffic; they make a 
mess. 
</P>
<P>
These are arguments that many have made about Costa Mesa's Share Our Selves and 
its poor clients, about 20,000 of them a month. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the complaints have a ring of truth, others of ignorance, and still 
others of bigotry and rage. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the arguments seem always the same. Someone has even come up with a 
catchall name. The NIMBY syndrome, they call it: Not In My Back Yard. 
</P>
<P>
So SOS, after months of City Council hearings, has been ordered to move out of 
a city-owned building in a neighborhood on Costa Mesa's west side. The charity 
hopes to buy its new place in an industrial area dotted with structures of 
concrete and glass. They just received an official, albeit temporary, city OK. 
</P>
<P>
Condo owners in Newport Beach are appealing, however, and so are residents of a 
Costa Mesa trailer park nearby. And now the Costa Mesa Chamber of Commerce has 
added its own nay to the seemingly endless fray. 
</P>
<P>
"SOS is a worthwhile organization," said chamber President Russell Gilbert, 
"but if you hurt business, you increase the ranks of poor and unemployed." 
</P>
<P>
From the start, of course, people-getting-hurt has been this dilemma's 
overriding theme. The City Council has been asked, over and over again, to 
decide. Will it be our needs or theirs? Who counts for more and where do we 
draw the line? 
</P>
<P>
SOS has got a good heart, is what many people say. Somebody really should help 
these people out. 
</P>
<P>
Even the Costa Mesa Chamber of Commerce has honored Jean Forbath, the SOS 
director, as its Woman of the Year. Forbath is a fighter, was the message there 
-- someone to admire, a woman with a lot of goodness and guts. 
</P>
<P>
Except now the fine print has come to light. NIMBY, Jean, the chamber says. We 
are sure you will understand. 
</P>
<P>
Many of us are uncomfortable with diversity, and in this, I believe, much of 
the NIMBY problem lies. 
</P>
<P>
We've been raised like this, most of us, living among our own kind. Our 
friends, for the most part, share the same views. Many find it unpleasant to 
spend much time with those of a different ilk. 
</P>
<P>
The other day the news media reported some jolting statistics courtesy of the 
Sentencing Project, a nonprofit group in Washington that has analyzed Justice 
Department crime data. 
</P>
<P>
One out of every four of this nation's black men, ages 20 to 29, are either in 
prison, on parole or on probation, the group said. That compares with one out 
of 10 Latinos, and one out of 16 whites. 
</P>
<P>
Poverty, isolation and neglect are primarily to blame. 
</P>
<P>
"We now risk the possibility of writing off an entire generation of black men 
from leading productive lives," said Marc Mauer, the author of the report. "We 
really don't know what it will mean for the future because we have never had a 
situation like this before." 
</P>
<P>
And earlier this year, the New England Journal of Medicine published a study 
comparing the longevity of men in Harlem with men in Bangladesh. They live 
longer in Bangladesh. 
</P>
<P>
Women in this New York City neighborhood live a little longer than those in 
Bangladesh, but only because fewer girls make it to the age of 5 in Bangladesh. 
</P>
<P>
Both of these studies, certainly, make for shocking headlines. I find them both 
hard to erase from my mind. 
</P>
<P>
Surely politicians, academics, social workers, physicians and anyone else with 
a conscience, will mull them over and heads will move, slowly, from side to 
side. People will say how appalled they are. Can't something be done? 
</P>
<P>
Harlem, of course, might as well be Bangladesh for most of us here. About 96% 
of its population is black, and 41% live below the poverty line. The people of 
Harlem die slow deaths from drink and drugs, or much more quickly, in violent 
bursts of pain. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County is one of the most affluent areas in the nation. This is what we 
boast about to those who live outside. And nobody, as far as I know, has 
thought to compare our pockets of squalor with those of the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
If they tried, we would tell them to concentrate on Harlem, or South Central 
Los Angeles, or Chicago's South Side. In comparison, the poor in Orange County 
are hardly worth mentioning. So we usually don't. 
</P>
<P>
Yet SOS is an exception, feisty and loud. This charity knows that poverty is 
not just somebody else's problem, in Harlem or in South-Central L.A., but one 
in which we all, ultimately, will share. 
</P>
<P>
By sharing ourselves, maybe we can save ourselves, too.

MEDICAL CENTER PLAN FOR UCI APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANICA KIRKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal for a medical research center on the UC Irvine campus will be 
forwarded to Chancellor Jack W. Peltason after receiving unanimous approval 
from the school's Academic Senate on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, a one-page report written by a special committee appointed by the 
Academic Senate last year, urges that "the highest priority be given to the 
planning and implementation" of the research center. 
</P>
<P>
An on-campus hospital has met with stiff community opposition, and in 1983 the 
University of California regents ordered UCI to drop the plan. Community 
concerns centered on the question of whether a new hospital on campus would 
drain resources from UCI Medical Center in Orange, which serves many low-income 
people, at a time when health-care options for the poor are shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
But this time, administrators hope a change in the concept of the medical 
facility and the support of the faculty will turn the tide in favor of the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping that the climate is different because the proposal is fundamentally 
different," said Dr. Walter Henry, vice chancellor of health sciences. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the new plan don't even want to call their proposal a hospital, 
saying that gives a false impression of what the facility would be. Instead, 
they say the proposed On Campus Center for Health Sciences will deal primarily 
with specialized care, such as Alzheimer's disease, and will not include an 
emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
An on-campus facility is also favored by faculty and students who must now 
commute 40 minutes to the UCI Medical Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Arquilla, a professor of pathology and chairman of the committee that 
drafted the proposal, said that people who now need the highly specialized care 
the proposed facility could provide must now drive to UCLA to receive it. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, the proposals have been to build a community hospital," Henry 
said. "We're not proposing that." 
</P>
<P>
Henry also emphasized that the new facility would not compete with UCI Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal now goes to Peltason and to an adminstrative committee which 
discusses priority projects at the university. Another resolution approved 
Thursday calls for regular reports on the status of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The vote came eight months after the a contentious debate in the Academic 
Senate that ended with the establishment of a committee to study the issue.

HOAG HOSPITAL PLANS TO DOUBLE ITS SIZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hoag Hospital officials met with local residents this week to present a general 
outline of a plan that would double the size of the hospital over the next two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
The discussion took place before a regular meeting of the West Newport Beach 
Assn., an umbrella group for area homeowners' associations. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion, which has not yet come before the city's Planning Commission, 
would stretch along West Coast Highway between Newport Boulevard and Superior 
Avenue. Residents say the density of the project is likely to become a source 
of controversy. "What we're concerned about is the massive development of the 
project," said Bill Jennings, a member of the ad hoc committee now being formed 
by the association to study expansion issues. "There are going to be some 
battles, I think." 
</P>
<P>
According to Peter Foulke, senior vice president of the hospital, the expansion 
has been discussed with city officials for more than a year. Rather than 
applying for a conditional-use permit as in the past, the hospital is creating 
a "planned community" concept that would require an amendment to the city's 
General Plan, Foulke said. Within the approved framework, the expansion could 
then unfold over the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Hoag, which officials say treated 127,000 patients last year and has the third 
highest bed capacity of any Orange County hospital, is now building a 
65,000-square-foot cancer center that is expected to open in June. A child-care 
center for children of employees has also already received city approval. 
</P>
<P>
The latest expansion plans would increase the hospital's general capacity and 
would add needed emergency rooms and intensive care beds, Foulke said. However, 
he stressed that the plans are still sketchy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's by no means final," he said. "The documents are just being drawn up. We 
have something we can work with now." 
</P>
<P>
Foulke said hospital officials have met several times in the last four months 
with homeowners in the area. Both Foulke and Jennings say they are hoping for 
more community input on the project. 
</P>
<P>
"There's going to be a lot of traffic, a lot of dirt and a lot of noise," 
Jennings said. "It's going to be a major impact on the city." Foulke said the 
expansion will come before the Planning Commission in the spring. LESLIE

PRESSMAN INJURED BY ERRANT PAPER ROLL

<TEXT>
<P>
A 48-year-old press operator for The Times Orange County Edition escaped 
serious injury Thursday afternoon when a 1,000-pound roll of paper fell off a 
rack and pinned him from the waist down against a partially loaded press, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Leonso Rodriguez, of Pico Rivera, was being held overnight at Fountain Valley 
Regional Hospital and Medical Center after X-rays showed he may have sustained 
two cracked vertebrae in his lower back in the 2:30 p.m. incident, said Helen 
Mitchell, a staff nurse for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said Rodgriguez was conscious and breathing when paramedics arrived 
at the Times' Orange County plant, in the 1300 block of Sunflower Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
According to production manager Tom Atkins, the accident occurred when 
Rodriguez and an assistant were loading a half-roll of newsprint onto the 
press. A second, half-roll, which was waiting to be loaded, fell from a cart 
and pinned Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
Three employees pulled the roll off of Rodriguez, Atkins said. Full rolls of 
newsprint weigh up to 2,200 pounds, pressroom employees said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez has been a Times' pressman for 10 years. WENDY PAULSON

COURT RULES FOR COUPLE IN POLICE SEIZURE OF CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ruling that a Santa Ana couple had a "reasonable expectation of privacy" in 
their back yard, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decided Thursday that 
police conducted an improper search and seizure of two automobiles that they 
owned. 
</P>
<P>
The judges, sitting in Pasadena, ruled 2 to 1 that the city violated 4th 
Amendment rights against unreasonable search and seizure because it did not 
obtain warrants to search the property. Dale and Linda Conner were awarded 
$71,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
The case traces its roots to a 1983 police investigation of complaints that the 
Conners were storing several old and inoperable cars on their property. Santa 
Ana police officers scaled the fence of the Conners' property and inspected the 
automobiles without a warrant and without the Conners' permission, the court 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Conners objected to the search and filed a complaint with the Police 
Department. After conducting a hearing, the department concluded that the 
search was proper and the City Council concurred. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, city officials, again without a warrant, broke down the fence 
surrounding the Conner property and removed two of the vehicles from the 
property. The vehicles were later destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
The Conners filed suit against the city and a U.S. District Court jury ruled in 
1987 that the 1983 search of the Conners' property was unreasonable. The couple 
was granted damages and attorneys' fees were awarded. 
</P>
<P>
But the jury agreed with the city that the 1985 search and seizure of the 
vehicles was reasonable. The city had argued that a warrant wasn't necessary 
for the 1985 search because the Conners had by that time been through several 
hearings on the issue of their cars and were aware that they were in violation 
of city codes. 
</P>
<P>
In ruling on the Conners' appeal of the ruling in the 1985 incident, 9th 
Circuit Judge Robert R. Beezer wrote that the city had the right to confiscate 
the cars but conducted the seizure improperly. Police should have obtained a 
warrant before going onto the Conners' property. 
</P>
<P>
"The Conners had a reasonable expectation of privacy in their enclosed, fenced 
yard. That expectation of privacy remained the same before and after the 
hearings," Beezer wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"The warrant requirement applied to the city when, without the Conners' 
consent, it broke down their fence, entered their property and seized their 
automobiles, regardless of how 'reasonable' the warrantless search appeared in 
light of the pre-seizure process afforded the Conners."

BUSH TO PRAISE ANTI-DRUG ORGANIZATION DURING VISIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
On high school gym shorts and water polo caps, grocery store bags, bumper 
stickers, hamburger wrappers and trucks' mud flaps. 
</P>
<P>
The logo with the message "Drug Use Is Life Abuse" by the organization with the 
same name has saturated Orange County in the year and a half since the group 
was founded by Sheriff Brad Gates. 
</P>
<P>
And because the group is funded completely by private donations, it is exactly 
the kind of volunteer effort that President Bush asked for in his 1989 State of 
the Union address. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the program's success and the White House's campaign against 
drugs, President Bush is traveling today to Orange County for the second time 
in a year to put his stamp on Gates' anti-drug effort. 
</P>
<P>
Last April, the president visited Orange County's Rancho del Rio, a remote, 
213-acre drug-smuggling hide-out that was seized by narcotics agents. The 
president noted the county's effective anti-drug operation when he presented 
the sheriff with a check for almost $4.4 million in money confiscated during 
the raid at the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Bush is expected to focus attention on Orange County's grass-roots 
campaign to coordinate corporations and classrooms in a high-profile battle 
against drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to highlight what we could accomplish without any federal government 
money," said Spencer Geissinger, executive director of the Drug Use Is Life 
Abuse Foundation. "We are the thousand points of light that the president has 
been talking about." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Lt. Orville King added, "This is a partnership between law 
enforcement and private enterprise." 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 of Orange County's largest businesses are now members of the Drug 
Use Is Life Abuse Foundation, officials say. The purpose of the group is to 
maintain public awareness about the issue and to educate schoolchildren -- 
starting in kindergarten -- about the dangers of drug use. 
</P>
<P>
"It's trying to change an attitude," said Ted Wedlake, a founder of the 
organization and a vice president at Western National Properties in Orange. 
"How did we get (people) to change their attitude about smoking, about buckling 
up, about drinking and driving? Those things were all cool 10 years ago. We've 
just got to make this not cool anymore." 
</P>
<P>
The methods employed to bring about this change in attitude have been creative. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsors have asked local clergy to give one sermon every quarter about the 
perils of drugs. They have made film presentations that some movie theaters are 
playing before their features. 
</P>
<P>
And they have put their stamp -- the Drug Use Is Life Abuse logo -- on almost 
every place it will fit. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation also sponsors classroom visits by sheriff's deputies. It 
recently published a booklet that the deputies distribute to students between 
fourth and eighth grade. Titled "Positively No Drugs," it was done with the 
help of Rams quarterback Jim Everett. 
</P>
<P>
According to Sheriff's Deputy Brad Warner, who travels to the Orange County 
classrooms, one out of every 10 sixth-grade students has smoked marijuana. By 
sixth or seventh grade, he said, most children have decided whether they will 
take drugs or not. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, he added, a person dies every 36 hours from heroine or 
cocaine use. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they do not know how much money the foundation has raised since 
it was started in September, 1988. And they declined to provide the public 
records about finances that federal regulations require nonprofit organizations 
to make available.

FULLERTON PROPOSES CUTTING THREE SPORTS 
</P>

<P>
Cal State Fullerton's efforts to resolve a budget crisis and correct inequities 
in the funding of women's sports have resulted in a plan to drop three sports, 
including men's gymnastics, a program that won three national championships in 
the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
A 1990-91 budget proposal that eliminates men's gymnastics and men's and 
women's fencing was passed unanimously by the university's Athletics Council 
Thursday. The budget requires the approval of University President Jewel 
Plummer Cobb. 
</P>
<P>
"I accept that budget changes have to be made," said Dick Wolfe, who has 
coached the men's gymnastics team for the past 22 years. "What I don't accept 
is that my program has to be cut. Why cut my guys so other programs can thrive 
and exist? I'm shocked that men's gymnastics was chosen." 
</P>
<P>
Valerie Berg, a senior on the women's fencing team that went 16-0 this season, 
said the team was "demoralized" as it prepares for NCAA regional championships 
this weekend at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is obviously really upset and disappointed because we always received 
less money than other sports anyway," said Berg, adding that team members hoped 
to continue as a club sport next season. 
</P>
<P>
Cobb was unavailable for comment Thursday, but an aide said she is aware of the 
proposal. Athletic Director Ed Carroll declined to comment, apparently at 
Cobb's request. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed $4.9-million budget includes substantial increases for women's 
sports, the result of a department study that showed that Fullerton was not in 
compliance with Title IX, a federal law that requires women's sports to be 
funded in proportion to the number of women competing on a school's teams. 
Fullerton needed to allocate 31% of its athletic budget to women's teams, 
according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed budget, which is balanced, includes: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 48% increase for women's volleyball, from $113,295 to $167,337. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 28% increase for women's gymnastics, from $190,698 to $244,226. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 20% increase for women's basketball, from $188,453 to $226,726. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 14% increase for women's softball, from $193,613 to $220,476. 
</P>
<P>
The three sports that are proposed to be cut have a combined budget of $130,639 
in Fullerton's current budget of $4.28 million. 
</P>
<P>
If the proposal is approved, Fullerton's athletic program will be reduced to 14 
sports, the minimum required for schools with football programs to compete in 
the NCAA's Division I-A. Men's gymnastics apparently was chosen to be 
discontinued because it was part of only two combinations that would keep 
Fullerton in compliance with NCAA and Big West Conference requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed budget responds not only to the inequities in funding women's 
sports but also to ongoing financial problems in a minimally funded program. 
</P>
<P>
The budget also proposes $42,000 more in scholarship funds for football, the 
result of a pledge of support from Cobb. But football would lose $46,800 in 
coaching salaries. 
</P>
<P>
Preston Dennard, a former Ram receiver who coached at Fullerton last season, 
recently said he lost his position because of budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Murphy said the cuts would affect his program, but not its 
competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to carry on," he said. "We can't complain. We have to figure out 
other ways to get around it." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's response to the Title IX study puts the university "on the cutting 
edge," said Bill Puzo, a professor of geography and a member of the Athletics 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton applied more stringent criteria than legally required by Title IX, 
and many athletic programs around the country are widely acknowledged not to be 
in compliance with the law. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been supporting more than the number of sports required, and perhaps 
more than appropriate to our budget," said Puzo, the chairman of the budget 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton is making cuts to respond to an $81,000 revenue shortfall that is 
contributing to a current deficit of $236,000, the bulk of which is the result 
of a change in accounting procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's effort to correct funding inequities was prompted by a movement 
started by several women's coaches last spring. The coaches praised the 
athletic department's response, and said they had never considered a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a relief that it's finally a reality," said Judi Garman, softball coach. 
"I don't feel good to know that somebody else is being dropped to do it, but 
each of us, like any coach, feels our primary responsibility is to our 
athletes.

UCI CLINCHES BIG WEST CELLAR WITH LOSS

SAN JOSE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mediocrity reigned supreme as UC Irvine and San Jose State met to decide last 
place in the Big West Conference Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
And with an 84-78 loss in front of 1,686 at San Jose's Recreation and Events 
Center, Irvine kept its stranglehold on last place secure. 
</P>
<P>
For weeks, it has almost been a foregone conclusion that Irvine would finish in 
last place. It finally happened Thursday; the Anteaters clinched the bottom 
spot. 
</P>
<P>
When Irvine's Ricky Butler was called for charging with 25 seconds left and the 
Anteaters trailing, 80-78, things looked grim. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose guard Tom Desiano made four for four free throws to seal the 
Anteaters' fate. 
</P>
<P>
And Desiano's free throws saved the Spartans the distinction of blowing an 
11-point lead with 10:34 left. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine rallied as first Dylan Rigdon, then Justin Anderson made three-point 
baskets, cutting the Spartans' lead to 68-63. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Butler made two free throws and a layup, and Irvine trailed, 73-70, with 
4:59 left. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Craig Marshall's free throw with 2:17 left tied it at 75. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose's Andre Brooks and Rigdon matched three-pointers. Kevin Logan then 
gave the Spartans the lead for good with a 10-foot jumper with 1:14 left. 
</P>
<P>
After a timeout, Irvine worked the ball inside to Butler, who slipped the ball 
outside to Rigdon for an open three-pointer. The ball went in and out, but 
Irvine's Rob Doktorczyk rebounded. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters worked it inside to Butler again. He crashed into three Spartans 
as he tossed in an off-balance, five-foot shot along the baseline. 
</P>
<P>
Butler was called for charging, wiping out the basket and giving San Jose the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not coaching that well, how the hell can I ref?" Irvine Coach Bill 
Mulligan said when asked about the call. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I (charged)," said Butler, who had a game-high 19 points. "I 
was trying to catch my balance and I dipped my shoulder. I don't think it was a 
charge." 
</P>
<P>
Rigdon added 18 points, but was only three of 11 from the field. He also had 
seven assists. Jeff Von Lutzow added 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
Kenne Young led San Jose with 18 points. Terry Cannon, a freshman who led 
Crenshaw High School to the state Division I championship last season, added 
15. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose improved to 8-18, 5-12 in the Big West. Irvine (4-22, 2-15) ends the 
regular season at Utah State Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost it by not defending all night," Mulligan said. "We just decided we 
weren't going to defend anybody." 
</P>
<P>
He paused a moment, then said, "I could have put more shooters into the game at 
the end, but I was afraid they were going to give up layups all night." 
</P>
<P>
San Jose's quickness, notably Cannon and Troy Batiste, made it difficult for 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Cannon swept by the defense repeatedly, freeing himself for layups and short 
jumpers. 
</P>
<P>
But speed had nothing to do with one easy layup Cannon got early in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
After an Irvine turnover, Cannon slipped behind the Anteaters, who seemed 
frozen at midcourt for no apparent reason. No one was within 25 feet as he 
dropped the ball into the basket. 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan signaled for time and ripped into his team. 
</P>
<P>
"Just a bad game," Mulligan said. 
</P>
<P>
Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
Guard Dylan Rigdon caught an elbow from Tom Desiano late in the game and was 
taken to San Jose Hospital for X-rays. "He got me right where the jaw bone 
starts (near the ear)," Rigdon said. "My teeth were chattering and I couldn't 
stop it. I can't bite down." That didn't stop Rigdon from carting off with a 
slice of pepperoni pizza as he headed for the team bus. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave San Jose State a sweep of Irvine for the first time since the 
1982-83 season. . . . Irvine's record dropped to 1-11 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine shot 46.7% from the field to San Jose's 54.1%.

<P>
Yugoslavia has the water polo world on the run. Winners of two consecutive 
Olympic gold medals and a world championship in between, the Yugoslavs have 
built a water polo dynasty near the Adriatic Sea. 
</P>
<P>
The United States water polo team won silver medals in the 1984 and '88 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"They're good because they have good athletes, they're well-coached and they 
have a great club system over there," U.S. Olympic Coach Bill Barnett said. 
</P>
<P>
That's one reason United States Water Polo, Inc., the national team's governing 
organization, has helped bring one of those clubs over here. 
</P>
<P>
For the past two weeks, Club Partizan, the leader midway through the Yugoslav 
national championship season, has been training in California with the U.S. 
national and junior national teams and playing matches against local club 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
Partizan, sporting a number of current and former members of the national team, 
will finish its tour with three exhibition matches against three Southern 
California club teams at 7 tonight at the Newport Harbor High School pool. 
Partizan will play the Beach, Bruin and Harvard clubs in consecutive two-period 
matches. 
</P>
<P>
Partizan is coached by Ratko Rudic, who was coach of the Yugoslav national team 
during its Olympic and world championship successes. 
</P>
<P>
After the victory in the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, Rudic stepped down as coach of 
the national team. Rudic, who competed in more water polo matches -- 297 -- 
than any other Yugoslav player, took over Partizan, a club for which he once 
played. 
</P>
<P>
In Yugoslavia, the club water polo season runs from October through June and 
the sport is third in popularity to soccer and basketball, Rudic said. The 
system allows players to continue competing into their prime water polo years 
-- 25, 26, 27 -- Rudic said. 
</P>
<P>
Rudic said the current tour is helping his team get used to playing against 
different competition in unfamiliar surroundings. He said U.S. water polo was 
also benefiting. 
</P>
<P>
"Yugoslavia is the best in the world in water polo but also the USA is second," 
Rudic said. "For me, we want to stay first and if the USA wants to be first, we 
have to be (compete) together. It's very important. I don't know if the people 
from the United States understand." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently they do. In preparation for the Goodwill Games this summer in 
Seattle and the world championships in 1991 in Perth, Australia, U.S. Water 
Polo is bringing in as many foreign teams as possible. Teams from Cuba, 
Australia, Hungary and the Soviet Union have commited to practice with the U.S. 
team here later this year.

Sophomore Jerry Aschoff allowed four hits and an unearned run in seven innings 
to help Rancho Santiago College to a 12-4 victory over Cypress Thursday in an 
Orange Empire Conference baseball game at Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress' first run came in the fifth inning and was helped along by an error 
and wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Aschoff walked two and had five strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
"He was definitely the key today," Rancho Santiago Coach Don Sneddon said. "He 
did a good job of getting his breaking ball over the plate. That is something 
he has struggled with in earlier games this season." 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago took a first-inning lead on a home run by Steve Grack. The Dons 
added a run in the fourth on back-to-back doubles by Conrad Colby and Marty 
Neff. Rancho Santiago (13-2 and 3-0 in conference play) scored three more in 
the fifth, one in the seventh and six in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Grack had three hits and scored three runs. Terry Tewell had three hits, 
including a double, for Cypress (11-5, 0-2). STEVE KRESAL

CHILDREN OF DIVORCE FORCED UP IN THE AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE SCHLOSBERG, Schlosberg is a contributor to View. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Bullard belongs to three frequent flier clubs and has accumulated 
enough miles in the air, he says, for "oh, about 43 free trips to China." 
</P>
<P>
So excuse him if he's a little tired of flight attendants who think they're 
teaching second grade. 
</P>
<P>
"They squeak their voices, and they say, 'Now, this is how you fasten your seat 
belt,' " says Michael, a guy with an earnest, freckled face and glasses perched 
on the tip of his nose. "Then they make you read the safety instruction card. 
I'm like, I've read it a million times. I could draw the card for you." 
</P>
<P>
"God," he says, rolling his eyes, "they treat me like I'm 7 years old." 
</P>
<P>
Since Michael turned 11 last December -- well, the magnitude of the insult is 
evident. Michael, who lives with his mother and stepfather in Sherman Oaks, 
flies several times a year to visit his father in upstate New York. He's one of 
a growing segment of the passenger population: kids who commute by themselves 
between divorced parents. 
</P>
<P>
Airline officials are reporting a dramatic increase in the number of children 
between 5 and 11 who fly unaccompanied by an adult. United Airlines carried 
200,000 unaccompanied minors in 1989, up from 100,000 in 1987. Based on 
conversations with the young passengers, United estimates that more than half 
are flying between divorced parents. Other major airlines, including American, 
TWA and Delta, report an increase but say they don't keep written statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Carlson, a child psychologist who practices in Tarzana, says he has 
noticed more of his young clients are commuting by themselves between parents. 
Until a few years ago, he says, "a parent would either go along with the kids 
or send an aunt or a nanny along. Now, kids have a great amount of 
responsibility placed on themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Some, like Michael, handle it well. They're grateful for the chance to visit 
the other parent, and they seem to gain a sense of independence from traveling 
alone. To them it's as easy as traversing the Valley on the Ventura Freeway, 
only a bit more exciting. "Especially the turbulence," Michael says. 
</P>
<P>
But for others, the commute isn't so simple. Some kids are afraid of flying, 
some are intimidated by strangers in an unfamiliar setting, and some don't want 
to leave the parent they're living with. 
</P>
<P>
Still others do want to leave. In January, a 12-year-old boy, tired of bouncing 
between his mom in Boston and his dad in Ft. Lauderdale, decided that he wanted 
to live with his dad instead of his mom. He was such a veteran of air travel 
that -- without his mother knowing -- he was able to catch a cab to Logan 
Airport, slip past gate attendants and stow away on a Delta Air Lines flight to 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Michael isn't planning an escape from Sherman Oaks, but he's no slouch either 
when it comes to airport knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
"O'Hare, that's the worst," says Michael, who has commuted since age 5. "They 
have H1, H2, H3, H4, H5 and they go all the way through the alphabet with 15 
numbers for each gate. But I like LAX because it's organized, and in Austin 
there's just 12 gates. Atlanta and Pittsburgh, you can handle them because 
there's no one there. But a place like Dallas-Ft. Worth, there's too many 
people -- it's crazy." 
</P>
<P>
So many kids are flying alone these days that in some cities many airlines, 
including United, TWA and American, have established special rooms where they 
supervise kids during layovers. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Taylor, who supervises the unaccompanied minor room at United's Denver 
hub, has seen many children of divorce pass through. 
</P>
<P>
"I had one little boy who had just come from visiting his dad in Florida, and 
he started telling me, 'I'm gonna move back with my Dad. My Dad wants me.' He 
was just on cloud nine." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the older kids resent having to stay in the room with younger kids, 
Taylor says. "They say, 'I'm big enough. I know what I'm doing.' I think a lot 
of it has to do with the kids feeling like they're being used. . . . And I'm 
sure they're frustrated with the fact that mommy and daddy can't be together." 
</P>
<P>
Because air travel can be such a hassle, airlines prohibit kids under 5 from 
flying alone. And those between 5 and 7 can take only direct flights. Some 
airlines charge $30 for escorting kids to connecting flights. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the adult who brings the child to the airport must provide the 
name, address and telephone number of the adult on the other end. The person 
picking up the child must show identification, which is especially important if 
there's a custody dispute, says United spokeswoman Sara Dornaker. 
</P>
<P>
Carlson says parents need to prepare their children for the experience or 
problems are bound to occur. 
</P>
<P>
"Many kids don't know they ought to be drinking liquids and snacking, and they 
sometimes forget to go to the bathroom," Carlson says. 
</P>
<P>
And some of them end up very fatigued. "Adults have trouble understanding the 
time perception of kids," he says. "A 5 1/2-hour flight can seem like a 15 
1/2-hour flight to a kid." 
</P>
<P>
Carlson says it's helpful to explain the concept of air travel in a concrete 
manner, perhaps with a toy airplane. It's also useful, he says, to make a 
cassette tape "saying aunt so-and-so is going to meet you at LaGuardia." 
</P>
<P>
While flying alone can be troublesome, for some kids it also has benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Jenna Ferer, 20, thinks commuting alone gave her an unusual sense of 
independence, which later fueled her desire to travel worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
"It gave me traveler's blood," says Ferer, who spent last year traveling alone 
through Israel, Egypt, India and Nepal. 
</P>
<P>
From the time Ferer was 5, she flew to see her dad in San Francisco and to 
vacation with him in Cabo San Lucas. While traveling as a child in the United 
States was no problem, she says, "The airports in Mexico were just a big mess. 
I remember going through customs. It felt like being in a movie, with bamboo 
and palm leaves on the roofs and a dirt floor in the terminal. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was really cool," says Jenna, who often traveled with her 
brother, who is a year older. 
</P>
<P>
But Jenna often feared her father wouldn't be there to pick her up. 
</P>
<P>
"We were put on a plane without anything being explained, and we were expected 
to intellectualize it. I learned not to trust my feelings. . . . I think I was 
upset about it, but I stuffed it down," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Some kids don't hide their feelings. Dornaker, United's spokeswoman and a 
former flight attendant, says she saw a 7-year-old girl and her 5-year-old 
brother break into tears just after takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
"They just sobbed their little eyes out after departure. I think it was the 
first time they had been separated from the parent they were living with. It 
was heart-rending." 
</P>
<P>
The flight attendants tried to comfort the kids by serving their meal as 
quickly as possible, and they soon cheered up. After the meal, Dornaker says, 
the girl came up to her and said, "Did you find the tip we left on your tray?" 
</P>
<P>
Michael is anything but anxious on a Thursday in February when he's flying to 
Austin, Tex., to meet his dad for a short vacation. 
</P>
<P>
Carrying a big black bag full of "junk my mom packed," Michael trudges through 
the Continental terminal at LAX. "It's just a regular thing to me," he says. 
</P>
<P>
While his mom, Laverne Maule, checks him in, Michael sits on a bench and draws 
cartoons. A few minutes later, Maule gives him his ticket and pins an orange 
badge onto his shirt, signifying that he's flying alone. Michael isn't pleased. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes you feel really geeky," he says, scrunching his face. 
</P>
<P>
When it's time to board, Michael and his mom walk up a ramp that leads to the 
door of the plane. 
</P>
<P>
"Guess I'll see ya Monday," Michael says, shrugging his shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," Maule says, giving her son a kiss on the cheek. "Guess I'll see ya 
Monday." 
</P>
<P>
Michael acts as if he's going no farther than the bathroom. He's planning to 
pass the time reading, playing Nintendo and talking to the other passengers. 
</P>
<P>
For Maule, the trip is tougher. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be better if he didn't fly so much," she says. "It's time consuming 
and expensive, and there's some fear of problems happening. I worry until he 
gets there, and I worry until he gets back."

MANY ELDERLY WOMEN LIVE ALONE IN POVERTY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a tiny apartment in a run-down Philadelphia neighborhood, Daisy Thomas lived 
alone. Pictures crowded the walls of her living room, a memorial to a past 
life. A copy of the Lord's Prayer hung above the door. Artificial flowers, 
faded with age, decorated the coffee table. 
</P>
<P>
A few hundred miles from Daisy's place, down the coast in Columbia, S.C., 
69-year-old Mattie Collins lived in a tired old house on the edge of town. She 
moved there after being evicted from her apartment three months before. Health 
problems, a son-in-law who stole from her and a string of bad luck drove her 
into poverty. 
</P>
<P>
Daisy and Mattie represent just two of the 8.3 million older Americans who live 
alone. More than 40% live at or near the poverty line. Most of the elderly poor 
receive only enough help from social workers and volunteers to survive -- 
occasional visits from social workers or home health aides, a meal a day from 
Meals on Wheels or a few dollars' worth of food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
Elderly women make up 80% of those who live alone. While Social Security and 
Medicare have helped to halve the poverty rate among senior citizens over the 
past 25 years, millions remain destitute. 
</P>
<P>
Daisy Thomas and Mattie Collins recently gave a visitor a glimpse into this 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Daisy's hands shook and her voice wavered as she spoke about growing old and 
living alone in a city that she once loved. Her neighborhood, where children 
once played in the streets, is now home to drugs, poverty and violence. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I'm afraid of being robbed. I got my Social Security check stolen right 
out from under me one day," she said, her eyes filled with fear, as if the 
incident had just happened. "I had just cashed my check and that boy grabbed 
most of it and I never saw him again. Getting old is not for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
After the robbery -- which took place nearly a year ago -- she kept the 
dead-bolts on her front door locked tight. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get robbed, that's it. Nobody is there to return it to you. You just 
have to get by on what's left." 
</P>
<P>
To her visitor, it seemed hot in her cramped living room, but to Daisy, it 
still felt cold. Her eyes wandered nervously around the room, reflecting the 
discomfort she felt having someone there. She didn't want people to know how 
poor she really was. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to ask people for money, but if you get hungry enough, you'll ask," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Two days after that conversation, Daisy died, alone in her final moments just 
as she had been in the final years of her life. 
</P>
<P>
Daisy, who suffered from diabetes, high blood pressure and chronic heart 
failure, survived on a Social Security check and some food stamps. Not much was 
left after she paid her rent and utility bills. 
</P>
<P>
And she received little outside help. Underfinanced and short-staffed, the 
nearby office on aging could only afford to send someone by once every 8 weeks 
to tell her she was still on the waiting list for a home-care program. 
</P>
<P>
In a deteriorating neighborhood in Columbia, Mattie slowly ate the meal 
delivered once a day by the local office on aging, pretending not to notice the 
cockroaches crawling on her TV tray and couch. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to sound like a preacher," she said quietly, "but people 
shouldn't be treated like this. You work hard all your life and then you get to 
the point where you can't do it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
From a wheelchair in her cold, empty living room, she told of being evicted by 
her last landlord without even a chance to move her belongings. 
</P>
<P>
"They threw away all of my things," she said. "My baby pictures, clothes, 
washing machine. Everything went out on the trash pile. What wasn't stolen got 
ruined in the rain." 
</P>
<P>
Worse, the grandson that she loved and cared for was recently taken away by the 
social services department. Just barely able to take care of herself, she could 
not take care of the child. Noting that her daughter was too poor to care for 
him herself, Mattie said, "That boy has been my life." 
</P>
<P>
Mattie has been hit hard with health problems in recent years. Two strokes, 
four heart attacks, arthritis, kidney disease and respiratory problems have 
left her nearly helpless. Dentures are not covered by Medicare, so she does 
without. 
</P>
<P>
Her sole support comes from a monthly Social Security check and food stamps. 
With that, she manages to give some money to her daughter, who lives nearby. A 
social worker stops by occasionally to update her file. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how she gets by, Mattie smiled and said, "It takes a lot of strength."

NOBLE RED-CROWNED CRANE ON COMEBACK; 
</P>
<P>
BIRDS: CHINESE CONSERVATIONISTS USE CREATIVE TACTICS TO PROTECT THE NATION'S 
ANCIENT AND MAJESTIC BIRD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
XIN YANGGONG, China 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There it stood, about 13 feet tall, red crown high above its black-and-white 
body -- a red-crowned crane. I had traveled more than 7,000 miles to see this 
sight. The reality took my breath away. 
</P>
<P>
From Taoist art to modern slipcovers, the red-crowned crane has symbolized 
longevity in China for centuries. Visit any of China's ancient cultural sites 
and you will surely see a statue, a tapestry, a painting, a pebble portrait 
embedded in a walkway or some other representative of the Celestian Crane, as 
it is also known. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the same is true for modern sites. Visitors to the State 
Meteorological Administration in Beijing, source of national weather reports, 
find statues of cranes in front of the main building. They also decorate useful 
everyday items. 
</P>
<P>
After seeing the crane on tea canisters, bath towels, a funeral sheet, even a 
railroad overpass, I could believe Zhou Yuansheng, deputy director of the 
Forestry Technology Extension Service of the Jiangsu Agricultural and Forestry 
Department, who said: "The red-crowned crane is the most important animal in 
our country," adding that China's National Protection Law identifies it as 
such. 
</P>
<P>
This bird was referred to by one Chinese friend, a young office worker, as "the 
noble among creatures." Renditions of the crane are so ubiquitous that one 
might expect it to be, like China's human population, abundant. 
</P>
<P>
Not so: Between this traditional symbol of long life and China's burgeoning 
population has arisen competition for food, for space and, so far as the cranes 
are concerned, for life itself. 
</P>
<P>
The red-crowned crane is found only in China, Japan and the Soviet Union. 
According to scientists from Jiangsu's Environmental Protection Agency, the 
world's largest known flock winters in China's Jiangsu Province. 
</P>
<P>
There, amid tall tan grasses and reeds drying in Yancheng township's autumn 
sun, these striking birds with their scarlet pates find cover when they fly 
south from Heilongjiang Province in autumn. They come seeking this cover and 
open water for their winter foraging. In shallow salt waters at the edge of the 
Yellow Sea and in the muddy marshes, they hunt the small fish, tiny shrimps, 
frogs and crabs that make up their basic diet. 
</P>
<P>
But everything that the crane seeks in Yancheng is also used by human beings. 
The reeds and grasses are cut by villagers for baskets and mats. The shrimps, 
crabs, frogs and fish are food for humans as well. As a result, crane habitat 
is dwindling. 
</P>
<P>
To learn more about the red-crowned crane's prospects, I traveled to Xin 
Yanggong, the small fishing and agricultural village where the headquarters of 
the roughly 100,000-acre Yancheng Precious Birds Natural Conservation Area is. 
Established in 1983 by Jiangsu Province, this is China's first coastal nature 
reserve. Here, along with more than 200 other species of birds, the red-crowned 
crane is being studied and protected. 
</P>
<P>
With obvious love for their work, ornithologists at Xin Yanggong introduced me 
to their beloved cranes. And what a dramatic introduction it was! Chen Lan, a 
young woman from the village who is employed at the preserve, opened the door 
of a screened runway at the edge of the marsh. One after another, out stepped 
four stately birds that had been transferred by train as chicks from Zhalong 
Nature Preserve in Heilongjiang and hand-reared in Yancheng. 
</P>
<P>
Only one bore the red badge of adulthood, but the clean, white bodies of all 
glistened in the cold winter sunlight. When the adult spread its wings in 
warning against anyone approaching too closely, it was a startling sight. Black 
markings etched the lower edges of the wings, making them resemble mountain 
peaks against a cloud bank. Truly a living work of art. 
</P>
<P>
Out in the marsh a river flows. On our side, villagers from Xin Yanggong worked 
quietly, some cutting and stacking the vegetation that grows head high, others 
probing for succulent little crabs that hide under the surface just within 
reach of crane bill or crabber's stick. On the other side of the river, 
half-hidden by uncut grasses in the central refuge, someone spied a group of 64 
cranes gleaming in the noonday sun. 
</P>
<P>
Liu Xiping, deputy director of the Yancheng reserve, explained that in the 
secondary refuge, a 328-foot-wide border of the marsh, such activities are 
permitted, although no one may live there. The central refuge is devoted 
entirely to the cranes and other waterfowl. 
</P>
<P>
One important duty of the nature preserve staff is enforcement of these 
regulations. It was as though the cranes understood this, for they seemed 
oblivious to the workers beyond the narrow strip of water. Their brilliant 
bodies against the beige background seemed remote as they methodically foraged 
for food. 
</P>
<P>
With crane numbers so low, the need to be creative is apparent. Along with 
educational programs to alert local people to the need to protect the birds, 
scientists use other tactics that go beyond mere protection. One involves a bit 
of ornithological larceny. A red-crowned crane couple (the birds mate for life) 
normally produces two eggs per year, but if something happens to both eggs, the 
female will lay again. Eggs are systematically removed from nests for 
incubation at preserve headquarters. The mother crane then lays two more. 
</P>
<P>
How long will she put up with this? George Archibald, director of the 
International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wis., one of several international 
organizations cooperating to protect cranes, says that in captivity she may lay 
up to 12 eggs. According to Zhu Chengyao, director of the Department of Biology 
at the Jiangsu Education Institute, Chinese experience has been that in the 
wild, she will lay six or seven. In any case, this willingness to work overtime 
to perpetuate the species gives scientists a valuable tool in their work. 
</P>
<P>
Liu described a feeding program that researchers at the Yancheng reserve 
believe is causing changes in characteristics of the crane population. "We put 
fish, corn and other food in far places in the refuge, but we can't guarantee 
that it will all be found," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Conservationists hope that spreading supplementary food in remote regions will 
enable more birds to survive on smaller areas. Yancheng ornithologists are 
encouraged by the appearance in recent years of some family groups of four 
birds, two adults and two fledglings, instead of the usual groups of three. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1988, a Beijing Review reported: "According to the United Nations 
Crane Fund, in 1987 there were 1,080 red-crowned cranes in the world. . . ." By 
February, according to Liu, the number had grown to 1,100. 
</P>
<P>
Bird and egg transfers between nature reserves within China and between 
countries, as well as field studies and public education, have contributed to 
the continued existence of this treasured bird. Will the program be successful? 
Zhou is hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
"Because the life of the people in the area has improved, it's not necessary 
for them to shoot the birds for food. Before, when they were hungry, they did. 
Now even those who hunted for fun know they must not because there are so few, 
and the government protects them." 
</P>
<P>
It is too soon to be sure that the program will succeed, but as I watched those 
elegant creatures high-stepping through the marsh, it was clear that this world 
would be a poorer place without them.

PATIENTS' FEELINGS LEAK OUT IN THEIR ARTWORK; 
</P>
<P>
THERAPY: TO THE TRAINED EYE, THE COLORS AND SHAPES AND THEMES OF THE DRAWINGS 
SPEAK VOLUMES.

The man had made a monster, evil-looking, crouching, with forked tail and 
claw-like hand. When the clay dried, he painted it black, with red eyes and red 
mouth. Along its side, he made finger-fitting indentations -- he said they 
allowed him to get a grip on it, gave him some control over it. But into its 
claw, he put a tiny representation of himself. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you want to call it?" art therapist Ruth Ross recalls asking him. 
</P>
<P>
"Mother," the man said. 
</P>
<P>
To the therapist, the monster spoke volumes about the roots of the patient's 
present problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Verbally, we're skilled," says Ross, president of the Maryland Art Therapy 
Assn. "We know how to go around and avoid what we don't want the other person 
to know. But we don't know how to cover up with art, so it all hangs out." 
</P>
<P>
In art, people "reveal what they're feeling that they don't consciously know," 
adds art therapist Gail Fenster of Walter Reed Army Medical Center in 
Washington. Fenster has been using art to help AIDS patients express the 
emotional turmoil that comes with the diagnosis, the occurrence of new 
infections, a change of medications, and uncomfortable procedures. Feelings of 
fear, anger, isolation, loss -- and, eventually, peace -- come out in the 
artwork, she reports. 
</P>
<P>
In private offices and hospitals, in psychiatric care and general medicine, in 
diagnosis and treatment of children, adults, individuals and families, and in 
enhancement of work relationships, art therapy -- just as traditional 
psychotherapies -- requires talking. 
</P>
<P>
Art therapy is, in some cases, a springboard to communication, helping patient 
and therapist see what they're going to be talking about. If the topic is too 
painful and the patient too reticent, art therapy can allow them to focus on 
what's represented in the art before they aim, more directly, at what's 
happening in life. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes it helps patients clarify issues for themselves. For instance, says 
Linda Gantt, a West Virginia art therapist who is president of the American 
Assn. of Art Therapists, asthma patients can sometimes draw their concept of 
how they feel as an attack begins. The illustration triggers recognition of an 
impending attack, and the patient can do whatever the doctor has recommended to 
avert or minimize it. 
</P>
<P>
Ross tells of a child caught in a custody battle who drew himself on a fence 
between a powerful father and a mother who seemed to have more symbols of 
growth -- plus the jury -- on her side. A week or two afterward, the child 
decided he'd rather stay with his mother. 
</P>
<P>
Art is believed to be empowering: If you make something, you can control it -- 
and then you can use it. At Walter Reed, where the nine art therapists on staff 
are believed to be the largest such group at any one institution in the 
country, formal goals include having angry people draw themselves taking part 
in peaceful activity, encouraging people stuck in repetitive behavior to use 
different kinds of art materials and having addicts draw themselves involved in 
more responsible activities. 
</P>
<P>
The base on which art therapy builds is Freudian. 
</P>
<P>
"Human beings operate on a symbolic level, sometimes on many layers of 
symbolism," Gantt says. In art -- as in dreams, stories, body language, 
clothing and other nonverbal communications -- we create symbols and receive 
messages that are less guarded, less self-serving and sometimes more basic than 
the overt messages of our normal language, she says. 
</P>
<P>
Or, as Ross points out, "One picture is worth a thousand words." 
</P>
<P>
It's only worth it if you decode it, of course. Images -- such as monster 
mothers -- are fairly obvious, but Sigmund Freud once said, "Sometimes a cigar 
is just a cigar." Art therapists also warn about the dangers of 
overgeneralizing: "You can't make a big case out of every airplane," Ross says, 
pointing to the planes and rockets on her "graffiti wall," a large canvas where 
child patients have put their pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Because she knows the youngsters, however, she can point to the expression of 
power in this or that rocket, the powerlessness of the figure in the spider web 
cage, the anger in the knives and guillotine. There's a little house on the 
canvas, in which the child artist has written, "No Budy Home." There's a 
bulbous, tentacled alien, which one child drew and another copied, but the copy 
is clearly weaker than the original, and that tells something about the artist 
too. 
</P>
<P>
To the therapist, process is as important as product. In the ways that people 
create art works, experts can find clues to their general work habits, their 
sense of organization, their relationships and general dominance.: Does one 
person lead and others follow? Does one person impose bizarre images on the 
others, or does the group try to produce a rational pattern? 
</P>
<P>
For the patient the process can also be therapeutic. "It's kind of 
self-soothing," Gantt says. "Sometimes chronically ill patients go almost into 
a trance; they focus their attention on something other than the body." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, too, it's a release. The acquired immune deficiency patients Fenster 
works with face losses no one can ever make up. In their art, she says, "They 
make restitution to themselves. The creative act allows for restitution, 
healing, regeneration. With the art, you're tapping into emotion. They're 
hurting inside; they get the hurt out on the paper, and they can leave it 
there, all nasty, or they can turn it into something beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
The nastiness is hard to miss: Short, angry color strokes; sterile trees, 
storms and coffins appear as disease first strikes, and as it worsens. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as acceptance comes, there's beauty: An angel rises, flowers bloom, peace 
returns in remembered pleasures and love transcends despair.

LINK? How to account for two joint appearances of George Bush and Brad Gates in 
less than a year? The missing link may be Eileen Padberg, Bush's 1988 
California primary campaign manager. . . . She's a planner of Bush's visit 
today (B1) and is also Gates' campaign manager. . . . When Bush asked in his 
1988 State of the Union address for volunteerism in the drug effort, Padberg 
sent a report on Gates' Drug Use Is Life Abuse Foundation, which led to Bush's 
April visit. Said Padberg: "It's just a matter of letting the White House know 
what's going on out here." Kristina Lindgren and Mark I. Pinsky

DOZENS OF PROTESTERS REPORTED SLAIN IN KASHMIR;

INDIA: TROOPS OPEN FIRE IN CLASHES AFTER NEARLY A MILLION PEOPLE RALLY FOR 
INDEPENDENCE.

<P>
The Indian army shot and killed dozens of demonstrators in the embattled 
Himalayan state of Jammu and Kashmir on Thursday after nearly 1 million 
protesters gathered in the state capital for the largest-ever rally for 
Kashmiri independence. 
</P>
<P>
State-run television and radio announced from the strategic border state that 
at least 29 people were killed and scores injured after demonstrators stoned an 
army convoy, attacked buses and tried to grab weapons from the soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
Partisan sources in Srinagar, the state capital, described the day's carnage as 
a "massacre." They said women and children were taken off buses and shot in the 
head by soldiers. They put the death toll at 70 and charged that none of the 
secessionist protesters were armed. 
</P>
<P>
The Indian government expelled all foreign journalists from Srinagar last month 
after the Indian army was deployed to suppress a growing independence movement 
in the state, which borders Pakistan, India's traditional foe. 
</P>
<P>
All requests by journalists to visit Kashmir have been denied in New Delhi, and 
the only news from the state has been from official government media or 
long-distance telephone conversations with Srinagar residents, most of whom 
appear to support the secessionist drive. 
</P>
<P>
One such source said by telephone this morning that the army "massacred" 16 
civilians, among them women and children, in a bus near the Srinagar airport 
and that an additional 48 demonstrators near the city's Zakura district were 
gunned down in cold blood. 
</P>
<P>
Several other sources reported that the day's death toll exceeded 60, although 
official radio and television asserted that the army had killed the 29 and 
injured 45 others in firing aimed at thwarting "a well-knit plan" by Kashmir's 
underground secessionists. 
</P>
<P>
Quoting from "intelligence sources," the state-run media said the 
pro-secessionist Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front was trying to kidnap 
schoolchildren from the buses when the army opened fire near the airport, 
killing eight. 
</P>
<P>
The official account added that the army killed an additional 14 in Zakura 
after protesters stoned an Indian army convoy and "tried to snatch arms" from 
soldiers attempting to break up the demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of Kashmiris are Muslim, and they have enjoyed considerable 
autonomy from Hindu-dominated India since deciding to join the Indian nation in 
1947, when the subcontinent was divided along religious lines to create an 
independent India and the Islamic state of Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
India has accused Pakistan of supporting the Kashmiri secessionists, who have 
gained far-reaching support since New Delhi reacted to months of growing street 
demonstrations by sending in thousands of Indian soldiers and barring outside 
journalists. 
</P>
<P>
Sources in Srinagar said that Thursday's huge demonstration included engineers, 
doctors, lawyers, educators and laborers, reflecting an expanding grass-roots 
support for the movement. 
</P>
<P>
Indian authorities, though, have labeled all of the secessionists "terrorists." 
</P>
<P>
Jammu and Kashmir, which has long ranked among India's most lucrative 
international tourist destinations, is also one of its most strategic states. 
Two of the three wars India has fought with neighboring Pakistan stemmed from 
their dispute over the region, and the third involved fighting there. The 
United Nations is still charged with policing the cease-fire line through it.

MIKE PENNER: TONY C.'S LEGACY: THE LONG GOODBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tony Conigliaro's career as an Angel was as short as it wasn't sweet, just 74 
games and 226 at-bats, barely enough time to say hello. 
</P>
<P>
His legacy, instead, was the long goodby. 
</P>
<P>
Conigliaro's last game as an Angel began on July 9, 1971. It ended on July 10. 
In between, the Angels and the Oakland Athletics played 20 innings -- the first 
19 1/2 without a run -- before the game was won by an Angel. 
</P>
<P>
But not the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
At 1:05 in the morning, Angel Mangual, a reserve outfielder with the A's, 
finally lined an RBI single to right field, coming with two outs in the bottom 
of the 20th and more than five hours after the opening pitch. 
</P>
<P>
The hit gave Oakland a 1-0 victory and ended the longest scoreless tie in 
American League history. The game remains the longest played by the Angels, 
sharing the distinction with another 20-inning affair against Seattle in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
It was even longer for Conigliaro. He went 0 for 8, struck out five times and, 
in an act of mercy by home-plate umpire Merle Anthony, was thrown out of the 
game in the top of the 19th. 
</P>
<P>
Less than five hours later, at 5 in the morning, Conigliaro summoned traveling 
Angel beat writers from their sleep for a motel lobby press conference, where 
he announced he was retiring from baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something I had to do or I'd end up in a straitjacket with the other 
nuts," Conigliaro said. 
</P>
<P>
"I almost lost my mind out there tonight. I was doing things on the field and 
saying things on the bench that I didn't know I was saying or doing." 
</P>
<P>
The late Lefty Phillips, then the Angel manager, couldn't argue with his 
ex-player. 
</P>
<P>
"The man belongs in an institution," Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
A sympathetic group, those Angels. During Conigliaro's struggles that season -- 
he batted just .222 and took 20 cortisone injections for a pinched nerve in his 
neck -- some of his teammates grabbed his uniform and a pair of crutches and 
laid it all out on a stretcher in front of his locker. For added effect, they 
then splashed the whole thing with ketchup. 
</P>
<P>
That passed for humor on a team that featured Alex Johnson, who thought it 
great fun to dump coffee grounds into a reporter's typewriter, and Chico Ruiz, 
who kept a gun in his locker. 
</P>
<P>
Conigliaro should have heeded the clues. This was a relationship doomed from 
the start. 
</P>
<P>
In 1967, the Angels nearly killed Conigliaro. It was an Angel, Jack Hamilton, 
who threw the pitch that beaned Conigliaro in the left eye, an injury that 
should have ended his career then and there. 
</P>
<P>
But Conigliaro came back in 1969 and hit 20 home runs for Boston. The next 
year, he hit 36 more and drove in 116 runs. The Angels, finishing a close third 
in the AL West in 1970, figured the 1971 pennant was only a Tony C. away, so 
they traded a couple of Tatums -- Ken and Jarvis -- and Doug Griffin for him 
during the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
But by early July, Conigliaro had four home runs and 15 RBIs and the Angels 
were on their way to finishing 25 1/2 games out. The weight of fallen 
expectations hung heavy on Conigliaro, and on July 9 in Oakland, he finally 
gave way. 
</P>
<P>
Conigliaro had already had one run-in with Anthony -- after an 11th-inning 
strikeout -- before he stepped to the plate with Ken Berry on first base in the 
top of the 19th. Phillips ordered Conigliaro to bunt. Conigliaro tried. 
</P>
<P>
He missed all three attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Called out again on strikes, Tony C. saw red. Protesting that he hadn't bunted 
on the third strike, Conigliaro shouted and stomped after Anthony, flailing his 
arms in the air. Soon to follow were his batting helmet and his bat, both 
landing 50 feet down the first-base line. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony immediately ejected Conigliaro, who retired to the visitors clubhouse 
and, then, retired. 
</P>
<P>
"I was on the ledge tonight," Conigliaro would tell bleary-eyed writers before 
the next sunrise. "When I came back to the (hotel) room, I was twitching and my 
stomach was in knots. I thought, 'What am I doing here?' " 
</P>
<P>
Conigliaro also divulged, for the first time, that the sight in his left eye 
had begun to deteriorate again. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a hole that will always be missing dead center in the eye," he said. 
"When the pitcher holds the ball, I can't see his hand or the ball." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels responded coldly, placing him on the voluntary retired list and 
terminating his salary. Conigliaro, claiming the eye injury had forced him to 
quit, had to file a grievance to receive his full 1971 pay. 
</P>
<P>
Tony C. sat out three seasons before attempting one more futile comeback with 
the Red Sox. He lasted just 21 games. He batted just .123. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, when kidney failure claimed Conigliaro, reams were written about 
what he had represented to the Red Sox. He was the embodiment of that 
franchise's cursed fortune, the Boston slugger who had the strength, the 
skills, the personality and the looks -- everything he could possibly want, 
except luck. 
</P>
<P>
With the Angels, Conigliaro represented the first broken promise. Before 
Conigliaro, any success the Angels encountered was a pleasant surprise. But his 
acquisition legitimized the Angels. In 1971, for the first time in their 
history, the Angels were preseason favorites. 
</P>
<P>
That year's failure set a trend the team hasn't lived down since. Be it 20 
years or 20 innings, the Angels haven't yet disappointed in their ability to 
disappoint. 
</P>
<P>
Tony C.'s eyesight was bad, but by his lead, we should have seen what was 
coming.

It is never easy replacing a well-liked coach. Ken Ezratty was well aware of 
that last November when he started his first season as coach of the Dana Hills 
High School girls' soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
Ezratty, who had never been a varsity head coach, came to Dana Hills to replace 
Chuck Hoover, the man responsible for starting the Dolphin girls' soccer 
program 10 years ago and for bringing it to prominence in recent years.

In his first week of practice this season, Ezratty already was faced with 
challenges from his players: 
</P>
<P>
"Chuck wouldn't have done it that way." 
</P>
<P>
"Why should we do that?" 
</P>
<P>
"I'm quitting!" 
</P>
<P>
Now, the story -- and the team's attitude -- is quite the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills will meet South Coast League rival El Toro at 6 tonight in the 
Southern Section 4-A championship match at Gahr High School in Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
For the Dolphins, who before this year had never gotten past the first round, 
the turnaround -- in spirit as well as success -- has been tremendous. Dana 
Hills started its season by winning the Irvine tournament -- a tournament in 
which it had never advanced past the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in their first league game, the Dolphins upset perennial power Mission 
Viejo -- another first. 
</P>
<P>
Was Ezratty surprised? Shocked? Overwhelmed at his team's success? 
</P>
<P>
"If you'd asked me when I first took the job, I would've said, 'Yes, I'd be 
surprised,' " Ezratty said. "But once we won the Irvine tournament -- and blew 
everyone out -- I knew we were going to be good. Especially since before the 
season, everyone had said El Toro would be the team to beat, and then we beat 
them, 2-1, in the (Irvine tournament) final. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a big help. I mean, if we had lost our first four or five games, it 
would've been disastrous. But we had a 10-0 start before we lost our first 
game. . . . The girls were on a high." 
</P>
<P>
That's not what they were feeling like months earlier, when Hoover announced he 
was leaving the area to buy a home in Vista. "He told the girls he was leaving 
during summer league," said Ezratty, 24. "They were devastated. Some of the 
girls didn't even show up for his last two games (during summer). . . . 
</P>
<P>
"When I took over, yeah, it was tough. Chuck Hoover was loved by everyone. The 
faculty liked him, the girls liked him, the community liked him. . . . But I 
knew I could only coach the way I knew how. I told the girls we would spend 
this year learning about each other. And that's what we've done." 
</P>
<P>
Although he is only 24, Ezratty, who teaches advanced placement history at Dana 
Hills, has the poise and patience of a coaching veteran. Ezratty, who grew up 
in Torrance, started playing in the South Bay-based American Youth Soccer 
Organization at 5, before becoming an AYSO referee at 13 and an AYSO coach at 
15. 
</P>
<P>
Before Dana Hills, his only high school coaching experience was as an assistant 
at San Diego Crawford and as a junior varsity coach at Dos Pueblos. But those 
were boys' teams. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time I've coached girls' soccer," he said. "It is different. 
But now, I think I've learned how." 
</P>
<P>
Based on this season's success, few would dispute that. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Section Soccer Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's match will be the fourth meeting between El Toro (20-3-3) and Dana 
Hills (22-3-1) this season. Dana Hills has a 2-1 edge, having beaten El Toro in 
the Irvine tournament final, and then splitting their league meetings. The two 
shared the South Coast League title this year. . . . Junior midfielder Shawn 
Viloria leads the Chargers with 30 goals this season, but has been held 
scoreless in her last two games. Jen Koenig has 17 goals to lead Dana Hills.

WESTENDORF PROVIDING SWEET DREAMS; 
</P>
<P>
PREP BASKETBALL: ST. MARGARET'S 6-7 JUNIOR CENTER IS MAKING A BIG IMPACT AT A 
SMALL SCHOOL.

Ryan (The Dream) Westendorf. No, it doesn't flow from the tongue quite as 
easily as Akeem (The Dream) Olajuwon. 
</P>
<P>
But listen to Coach Rick Bauer of St. Margaret's High School as he practically 
gushes about his 6-foot-7 center, and the nickname seems to fit. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a recruiter's dream because of his academic side," Bauer said. "He's a 
coach's dream because he's got a tremendous attitude and a great work ethic. 
And he's a player's dream because when you play with him, he inspires you and 
has an unselfish attitude." 
</P>
<P>
After such a dreamy endorsement, what else is left to say about Westendorf? 
Plenty. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, there are Westendorf's statistics, which Bauer called 
"staggering." He is averaging 25.6 points and 19.6 rebounds a game entering the 
Small Schools championship game against top-seeded Ribet Academy at 7:30 
tonight at Saddleback College. 
</P>
<P>
But the number Bauer talks of most often is Westendorf's 3.9 grade-point 
average last semester. "He's the perfect profile of a student athlete," Bauer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Can Westendorf play at the Division I college level -- a rarity for a player in 
the Small Schools division? Yes, Bauer said emphatically. But Westendorf shrugs 
his shoulders and hardly seems concerned about the question. 
</P>
<P>
His reaction to the major-college question reveals another aspect of the 
16-year-old that Bauer brags about. At a time when many think sports receives 
too much attention, Westendorf said he has his priorities set. He works Sundays 
as a box boy at a grocery store and concentrates on academics, calling sports 
the "extra stuff." 
</P>
<P>
The lanky junior will be the center of attention in tonight's game. Ribet Coach 
Mark Miller said his team must slow Westendorf, who is averaging 26.5 points in 
the playoffs, to win. 
</P>
<P>
Westendorf handles the ball well, intimidates on defense, has a soft touch 
inside and is capable of shooting from three-point range, Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's had a great year for us in so many different ways: leadership, offensive 
productivity, defensively," Bauer said. "He has not had one slump." 
</P>
<P>
Such attributes have enabled Westendorf to start for three seasons and earn the 
Academy League's player of the year award this season, despite facing 
double-team and sagging zone defenses in most games. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the question remains: Would Westendorf dominate against teams from bigger 
schools with more talent and depth? The Small Schools division consists of 
schools with enrollments of 149 students or fewer; St. Margaret's has an 
enrollment of 124. 
</P>
<P>
"It's how hard he plays and how he progresses and not about the size of our 
school," Bauer said. "Ryan is a big fish in a small school. He'd be a big fish 
in a big school." 
</P>
<P>
Said Westendorf: "It gets frustrating. I think I have the ability to play at a 
bigger school, but you're not going to change schools just for sports. It's 
hard sometimes, but I'm not going to cry about it." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Westendorf wishes he played tougher competition during the high school 
season, when he seldom faces a player of equal size. To meet better players, 
Westendorf competes in the Slam-n-Jam league in the spring and becomes a 
"basketball beach bum" during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I still face good players," he said, "just not during the league." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Bauer envisions Westendorf with a few more pounds on his 185-pound 
frame and improved power moves, and he sees a Division I forward. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been around basketball all my life and I think he's a definite Division I 
prospect," he said. "If he continues to improve and work on fundamentals, it 
doesn't matter if he comes from a small school or a big school. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this year has been great for him, all the accolades and publicity he's 
received. I think it's made him focus on what kind of future he has to go on to 
college and play basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it has. But whether the future includes college basketball, Westendorf 
said, is not a great concern. 
</P>
<P>
Westendorf, who has received letters from Notre Dame, USC and Loyola Marymount, 
said he will not attend a junior college or small college to continue playing 
basketball. Instead, he will go to a major college, for academic purposes, and 
perhaps try to walk on to the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to college regardless," he said. "If I get a scholarship, that's 
great and wonderful and I'll use it to its fullest. But if I don't, it's not 
anything heartbreaking. I don't plan on playing pro basketball. The sports will 
end somewhere. You need something afterwards."

ORANGE INDEPENDENT OWNER TO ADD PAIR OF COMMUNITY PAPERS TO CHAIN;

PUBLISHING: THE DEAL TO ACQUIRE THE BUENA PARK NEWS AND THE CYPRESS-LA PALMA

NOW OWNS THEM.

Robert L. Cashman, owner of the weekly Orange Independent newspaper, has agreed 
to purchase the Buena Park News and the Cypress-La Palma News from Southern 
California Community Newspapers for an undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
Cashman said the deal involves a partnership agreement under which SCCN will 
continue to print and distribute the two free weeklies and Cashman will be 
responsible for the editorial and advertising operations. Cashman said he 
intends to rent new offices, hire a staff of five and use the resources of the 
Orange Independent to put out the two papers. 
</P>
<P>
Current employees will remain with SCCN, which operates 24 papers in the Los 
Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement also includes an arrangement under which Cashman's publishing 
company, City Communications Corp., will sell advertising in Orange County for 
the SCCN titles, and SCCN will do the same for City Communications. 
</P>
<P>
Ric Trent, SCCN chief executive officer, said his aim was to find a partner who 
knew the Orange County market so that his company could focus on the Los 
Angeles area. SCCN plans to expand into San Gabriel, Whittier and Rosemead, 
boosting the number of titles to 27. 
</P>
<P>
Those towns had been served by weeklies owned by Golden West Publishing Inc., 
the chain that publishes newspapers in Orange and Los Angeles counties. Media 
General Inc. has agreed to sell Golden West to Freedom Newspapers, owner of the 
Orange County Register, for $20 million. Golden West recently closed eight 
money-losing weeklies in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper officials say North County is a difficult market for community 
weeklies. But Cashman, who owns two printing businesses and a metal fabrication 
company in Orange County and is also a member of the airport commission, said 
he plans to acquire at least three more papers in the area over the next three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Cashman said he is aiming to break even on his newspaper operations rather than 
"pushing them to be profitable. We take the revenues and put them back into the 
community."

<P>
Enticed by a multimillion-dollar Lotto jackpot, struggling writer Lanny Turner 
grabbed $50 worth of blank game cards three years ago, went home to his small 
Greenwich Village apartment and filled in his picks. 
</P>
<P>
While tediously blacking the required six boxes per game, "I started going 
nuts" thinking of lucky numbers, he recalled recently. "Once you begin filling 
in those squares, you see patterns and start brooding: 'No, I used this number 
too many times already.' 
</P>
<P>
"So I figured there had to be a better way" to mark Lotto slips, Turner said. 
"And I sat down and came up with a better way." 
</P>
<P>
Turner's solution is a hand-held, less-than-$5 mechanical device he calls 
"Lotto Luck." The lucky charm, which recently received a U.S. patent, generates 
six random numbers and can instantly blacken the corresponding boxes on a bet 
slip. The inventor has crafted a working model and is searching for a 
manufacturing and marketing partner. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Turner fantasizes no more about winning millions through betting. He 
believes he is going to strike it rich via his betting gadget. 
</P>
<P>
"I see myself making a substantial amount of millions," the 47-year-old 
inventor said recently as he heated up a cup of instant coffee in his 
microwave. On one kitchen counter sat his tidy lab: a lathe, a vacuum cleaner 
and assorted design implements. 
</P>
<P>
A Chicago native with a strong hometown accent, the shaggy-haired and laid-back 
inventor moved to New York more than 20 years ago to study film writing. Odd 
jobs since have included taxi driver, department store clerk and 
"gofer-chauffeur." 
</P>
<P>
His numerous screenplays, poems and short stories remain unpublished, but in 
recent years, Turner said, he has made a living as a business consultant, 
linking friends with deals. 
</P>
<P>
Turner remembers vividly the night the Lotto Luck idea flashed. "My mind just 
flies when I consider how to solve a problem," he said. "I stopped filling out 
the bet slips, and drew sketches. It was probably late, after midnight. It took 
me 40 minutes to think the problem out, and only a short time to draw it." 
</P>
<P>
Waking the next morning, the inventor vowed to himself that he would persevere. 
Over the next six months, Turner labored to build a working prototype of his 
dream. He taught himself about tools, plastic and adhesives. He went to the 
library, consulted experts. While in his kitchen lab, "sometimes I'd work 18 
hours straight, from 8 in the morning to 2 in the morning, and listen to opera" 
all the while, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The final design is rather simple. Lotto Luck is a small, plastic box that 
consists of upper and lower chambers. The top chamber has a floor with 54 holes 
-- corresponding to the 54 possible numbers in the weekly New York Lotto. Six 
BBs are locked in the chamber. The bottom portion, or main body, has 54 
cylindrical holes -- each one filled with a thin rod tipped with ink. 
</P>
<P>
To use, the bettor first shakes the box, causing the BBs to fall randomly 
through six holes into shallow slots. Then the bettor holds the device exactly 
over a blank betting slip and presses down: The top chamber descends to push on 
the balls, and the balls, in turn, force down a series of rods in the lower 
chamber so that the tips mark the card at contact points. 
</P>
<P>
The box is sized to fit over the Lotto 54 game slip, and the holes and pins are 
spaced to mimic the betting grid -- six rows of nine. A container with a stamp 
pad houses the entire reusable unit. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are other gadgets on the market that generate random series of 
numbers -- such as calculators, pens, watches and even vending machines -- none 
automatically prints the numbers on an official betting slip, Turner said. He 
said he also considers his device "a hands-on, fun experience." 
</P>
<P>
True, last April New York State did introduce "Quick Pick," a computer that 
generates random numbers for Lotto players who do not have the time to select 
their own digits. Quick Pick instantly prints the numbers on a Lotto ticket 
too. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Turner believes many players do not trust the state's we'll-pick-for-you 
option. "Quick Pick is too impersonal, too high tech," the inventor said. 
</P>
<P>
Lottery experts' reaction to Turner's idea is mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Herb Whiton, a New York-based licensing executive, thinks it is a potential 
winner. Whiton's company, Licensing Development Group, has invested in its 
development and is seeking to interest a liquor, cigarette or card company that 
distributes in New York State Lotto outlets to manufacture and sell the device. 
"They could sell it at a nitty-gritty price of $2 to $5 -- it's a 'no-brainer' 
to use," he said. A company also might give it away as an advertising gimmick, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no need for Lotto Luck whatsoever," philosophized Whiton. "But there's 
no need for someone to have the same shirt in 40 colors, either. It's desire. 
And I think there's a desire on the part of many gamblers for a rabbit's foot 
to help them." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Carr, president of the North American State and Provincial Lotteries 
Assn. and commissioner of Michigan's lottery, is more negative: "I don't see 
any real rush to buy that kind of product. Most people don't have problems 
marking six numbers." 
</P>
<P>
Carr added that many bettors like to play lucky numbers -- birthdays, telephone 
numbers, addresses -- or find an idiosyncratic approach. One player in Michigan 
"scattered papers with numbers on them on his floor. The first six numbers his 
cat stepped on, he wagered. He hit, then he rented the cat out." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Turner remains confident of his eventual windfall. He believes 
variations of his product can be marketed to the 31 states with lotteries, as 
well as foreign countries. Last year, more than $17 billion was wagered on 
state lotteries, Carr said. 
</P>
<P>
Turner said he will buy a boat and a larger apartment if Lotto Luck clicks, but 
win or lose, he will continue to write and invent. "I like making things," he 
said. Current projects: an improved loudspeaker, an anti-wobble table leg and a 
spill-proof ice tray.

EAST VILLAGE IMPROV FROM THE ORDINAIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a sound level more appropriate to Motley Crue at the Forum than to fiddle 
players in the tiny Cafe Largo, the Ordinaires' show on Tuesday seemed to be in 
the classic jammin' amateur mold of second-level East Village improvisation: 
eight bars of fake Schubert leading into 24 of something that sounds like -- 
but isn't -- Hendrix's "Manic Depression"; fake Indian film music with fake Cab 
Calloway breaks. 
</P>
<P>
The all-instrumental New York nonet (a couple of violinists, a cellist, two 
reed players, two guitarists, a bassist and a drummer with a deep Mitch 
Mitchell fixation) inspired the kind of frisson in the audience that the Kronos 
Quartet usually gets with its version of "Purple Haze." 
</P>
<P>
The Ordinaires are famous for their screeching version of Led Zeppelin's 
"Kashmir," which got some MTV play last year and proved beyond a shadow of a 
doubt that real strings can indeed sound like a Mellotron instead of the other 
way round. (The band sounds a lot better on paper than it does in concert.) 
</P>
<P>
But somehow, for all of the Ordinaires' willful, record-collector eclecticism, 
the band usually sounded like the score to a quickie European sex flick . . . 
when it wasn't mired in the noisy Captain Beefheart surfisms common to any art 
band anywhere.

ST. PATRICK'S SHOW TO TURN INTO TRIBUTE; 
</P>
<P>
CONCERT: THE ORANGE COUNTY FOLK MUSIC SOCIETY AND PADDY WEST WILL HONOR TRIO'S 
FOUNDER, PATRICK KENNEDY, WHO DIED IN DECEMBER. 
</P>

<P>
Orange County's popular Irish folk group Paddy West will give its annual St. 
Patrick's Day concert at Orange Coast College on Saturday, but this year's 
affair will be a bittersweet celebration. 
</P>
<P>
In December, the group's founder, Irish-born singer and songwriter Patrick 
Kennedy, died in his sleep at age 45, apparently of heart failure. 
</P>
<P>
The group's remaining members, Jessie Kelly and George Kavanaugh, will perform 
as a tribute to Kennedy. The pair will be joined by seven members of the Orange 
County Folk Music Society, of which Kennedy was a member. 
</P>
<P>
Paddy West, whose name derives from the title of an Irish folk song, has played 
around the Southland for years in all seasons but was predictably in greatest 
demand each March, when all Americans seem to turn a wee bit Irish. 
</P>
<P>
But Kennedy never let the day's reputation for lush pseudo-sentimentality 
overpower his respect for the music of his homeland, which he left in 1975 to 
settle in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1987 Times interview, Kennedy told how he deftly fended off requests for 
such St. Patrick's Day tear-jerkers as "Danny Boy" and "Mother Machree": "I 
tell people, 'I don't know that song well enough to play it right. But I'll 
tell you what -- I'll play another song that I know you will like.' " 
</P>
<P>
He preferred to play his own songs and, especially, the Emerald Isle's 
traditional jigs and reels -- what he called "the real stuff. I'm playing what 
I would be playing in Ireland." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy worked by day as a structural engineer and kept his music as a serious 
hobby, rather than as a profession. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its college appearances, the trio, whose membership has varied 
over the years except for Kennedy, had been a favorite at local bars. But 
Kennedy expressed little interest in trying to strike commercial gold: 
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing against the commercial music. I like a lot of it. I just can't 
perform it myself and feel at home with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Paddy West will perform Saturday at 8 p.m. in Fine Arts Recital Hall at Orange 
Coast College, 2701 Fairview Road, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $6.50 advance, $8 at 
the door. Information: (714) 432-5880.

SECOND HELPINGS;

GUSTAV ANDERS NOW SERVING UP EXCELLENT FOOD, GOOD SERVICE

<P>
Last summer, I experienced mild disappointment at Gustav Anders, the La Jolla 
transplant that was expected to become one of Orange County's best restaurants. 
Today, I'm happy to say that it has begun to realize its potential. 
</P>
<P>
The sparse, rustic design makes for one of the area's most striking dining 
rooms, and the outdoor patio is a pleasant place to have lunch. Maitre d' Bill 
Magnuson (Gustav is his middle name) is a solicitous, able host, and he 
obviously has solved any problems with his staff. Service here, once spotty and 
indifferent, is now nearly perfect. 
</P>
<P>
Ulf Strandberg (the Anders in the equation) is a creative and original chef, 
and he seems to have ironed out the inconsistencies as well. The same good 
breads such as Swedish limpa, Italian country white, brown crispbread and the 
world-class onion rolls still accompany all meals, and the menu still changes 
daily. But the food is more self-assured now, far more reliable. Apparently, 
Strandberg just needed time to settle in. 
</P>
<P>
At lunchtime, the dining room is airy and elegant, usually full to the brim 
with a well-dressed, professionally proper crowd. Wonderful appetizers like 
house pickled herring (served with Vasterbotten cheese from the north of 
Sweden) and a puffy wild rice pancake with smoked salmon, golden caviar and 
creme fraiche are fine al fresco choices. Salads of minced parsley with 
sun-dried tomatoes, garlic and parmesan have irresistible lightness. 
</P>
<P>
A wide variety of main dishes, French, Italian and Scandinavian-inspired, are 
available to tempt you, but I would go with Strandberg's strong suit, the 
cooking of his native Sweden. His sugar-and-salt-cured salmon is sheer delight, 
with creamed, pearl-sized bits of steamed potato, speckled with fresh dill, 
that are a revelation. The good desserts, Swedish cakes and homemade ice 
creams, are by Piret's of San Diego.

<P>
FOR THE RECORD: 
</P>
<P>
In my March 2 column titled "Second Helpings," I incorrectly reported that the 
breads and desserts served at Gustav Anders restaurant in South Coast Plaza 
Village were made by Piret's of San Diego. Gustav Anders makes all its own 
breads and desserts, and I regret the error.

O.C. ARTS GROUPS PETITION NATIONAL FUND 
</P>

Several Orange County arts organizations have begun preliminary negotiations 
with the National Arts Stabilization Fund, a private, New York-based 
organization that has given millions of dollars to arts institutions around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Stabilization Fund, which awards grants to groups of arts 
organizations in distinct communities, look at prospective recipients and their 
communities to determine their ability to match grants (of up to $1 million per 
arts organization) on a 2-to-1 basis. 
</P>
<P>
The fund's current "local stabilization projects" aid arts groups in Phoenix, 
Seattle, Boston and Kansas City, Mo. "We are discussing possible projects with 
several other communities, with Orange County no more on the top of the list 
than a number of others," said Marcia Thompson, president of the nonprofit 
organization, which was established in 1983 with $9 million from the Ford, 
Andrew W. Mellon and Rockefeller foundations. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't even established . . . whether the community has the capability to 
put up the (matching) funds," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
Henry T. Segerstrom, chairman of the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 
started negotiations with the fund to find additional sources of support for 
the county's arts organizations, Center President Thomas R. Kendrick said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Late last year, Segerstrom and Kendrick requested financial data from the 
Orange County Philharmonic Society, South Coast Repertory, the Pacific Symphony 
and Opera Pacific. Together with the Center itself, those groups raised a total 
of $122 million over the past decade, according to Kendrick. 
</P>
<P>
Segerstrom and Kendrick then met with officials from the groups (and the 
Newport Harbor Art Museum) in January and are now supplying more information to 
the Stabilization Fund, Kendrick said. It can take between one and five years 
to determine eligibility for funding, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
While the Center could receive money from the fund, the grants would 
principally benefit arts groups "less (financially) stable than we are," 
Kendrick said, specifically citing Opera Pacific and the Pacific Symphony, 
which reportedly has an accumulated deficit of at least $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Stabilization Fund, designed in large part to increase organizations' 
working capital, allows no more than half of any single grant to be used to 
reduce a current (not accumulated) deficit, Thompson said. The rest is intended 
to increase cash reserves. None of the grant may be used for annual operations. 
</P>
<P>
Louis G. Spisto, Pacific Symphony executive director, said: "Our five-year 
financial plan calls for us eliminating our deficit by 1994 without the 
assistance of this fund. With the fund, we'd be able to retire the deficit and 
then build a cash reserve of what would probably be in excess of $1 million by 
that year." 
</P>
<P>
Shoring up the fiscal strength of local groups that use the Center could 
provide indirect benefits to the Center as well. Officials there say they plan 
to build an additional concert hall and a smaller theater, both reliant on the 
financial stability of local groups that would use them and possibly help pay 
for construction.

STYLE: ANTIQUE SCAVENGER'S NEWFANGLED 'EARLOOMS' HAVE A BEADY PAST 
</P>

Leslie Allen recycles old jewelry the way some people collect aluminum cans and 
newspapers, turning trash into treasure. She'll pull apart unwanted necklaces, 
brooches, bracelets, handbags, buckles and buttons and rearrange the pieces 
into glitzy, rhinestone-studded earrings that she calls "Earlooms." 
</P>
<P>
"I can take two of anything and turn them into a pair of earrings," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Because she uses antique findings, her earrings are a curious combination of 
old-fashioned trinkets set in contemporary, geometric designs. 
</P>
<P>
"They're like heirlooms. Each pair has a history. These came off of a 1920s 
movie costume," says Allen, pointing to a pair of triangle-shaped earrings with 
a row of red rice-shaped beads. 
</P>
<P>
To adorn her earrings, she has retrieved black beads from a necklace worn by 
her grandmother in the 1800s, cut beaded applique flowers from a 19th-Century 
wedding gown and dismantled a set of her late husband's cuff links. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't throw anything out," she says. 
</P>
<P>
A resident of Los Alamitos, the 60-year-old Allen commutes three times a week 
to the Rag Street Consignment Apparel shop in Laguna Beach, where she has set 
up a small workstation loaded with plastic trays of beads, pearls, sequins and 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I can do 20 pairs at a time," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Her tools are simple: cement glue and a gall-bladder remover. The latter, which 
looks like a pair of oversize tweezers, came from a friend who underwent a 
gall-bladder operation. Allen will recycle anything. 
</P>
<P>
She makes most of her earrings by gluing her treasures on black triangles or 
geometric-shaped mirrors that reflect the sparkling gems. For instance, she 
will take the flowers from a pair of 1940s clip-ons, glue them on small round 
mirrors and add clusters of crystals and seed pearls. 
</P>
<P>
"These earrings will be much bigger when I'm finished." 
</P>
<P>
She calls her larger, more lavish earrings "entrance makers." 
</P>
<P>
"When you walk in a room with those on, people notice." 
</P>
<P>
Most of her gem-encrusted earrings cascade two or three inches from the 
earlobe. Some pairs have a single tassel that sweeps the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"I like glitz," she says. 
</P>
<P>
A scavenger, Allen combs the bead shops of Laguna Beach, antique stores and 
costume shops for anything that sparkles. She's made earrings from a pair of 
old buttons painted with roses, dangles pulled off of chain belts worn by 
flappers in the '20s, brown-bead appliques from a '30s evening dress and the 
embroidered trim from a blouse collar. She pulls out a pair of triangle-shaped 
mirrors adorned with blue glass balls. 
</P>
<P>
"They're from my marble period," she says laughing. 
</P>
<P>
She'll also make earrings out of earrings, creating what she calls a "redo" by 
pulling the pieces apart and adding more sparkles. 
</P>
<P>
"If I only have one of something, I make it into a pin. I've done watches and 
belts, but earrings are my first love." 
</P>
<P>
She refuses to part with her favorite earrings, including those made from 
rhinestone buttons taken from a dress she wore to a high-school dance in the 
'40s. "That's like selling my children," she protests. 
</P>
<P>
A belt she made from watches once worn by her family will never make it to 
market. "This was my dad's," she says, pointing to a watch with a square yellow 
face. "And this is one I won in a beauty contest long ago." 
</P>
<P>
Many of her mementos come from costumes she wore while working as an actress. 
Allen has played assorted roles on television shows and soap operas, including 
"Another World," "As the World Turns," "Streets of San Francisco," "Days of Our 
Lives" and "Divorce Court." She's also acted in theater and films, including 
the role of Mabel in "The Candidate" starring Robert Redford. 
</P>
<P>
Until she started making Earlooms, she had no experience in design. "I never 
worked with my hands," she says. 
</P>
<P>
She made her first pair of earrings out of a tiny cameo that belonged to her 
mother, two pearls she found pearl-diving on her honeymoon and five stick pins 
that belonged to her grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know what to do with the stick pins. Who wears stick pins in this day 
and age? So I decided to make them into earrings." 
</P>
<P>
She showed the earrings to Jeannie Quaintance, a friend and owner of Rag 
Street, and Quaintance suggested she make more. Allen then raided a pair of 
two-foot-high cones that had been trimmed 40 years ago with old jewelry to look 
like Christmas trees. Friends brought her unwanted baubles from their jewelry 
boxes. 
</P>
<P>
She also began picking off the sparkles from her old costumes and others she 
bought at the Screen Actors Guild Cinema Glamour Shop in Los Angeles. She made 
10 pairs of earrings from a beaded dress worn by Elizabeth Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
"I've now made about a thousand pairs, and no two are alike." 
</P>
<P>
Allen sells Earlooms in six boutiques in Orange County and Los Angeles, 
including Rag Street, Santa Fe by the Sea in Seal Beach and Notorious on 
Melrose Avenue. Earlooms cost $30 to $85. 
</P>
<P>
"It's turned into a semi-paying proposition," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Allen custom designs earrings to match her customers' wardrobes and tastes. She 
recently made personalized earrings for members of a widows' support group. 
</P>
<P>
"One lady liked cats, so I went to a miniatures shop and found tiny bags of cat 
food and bowls. Another liked sweets, so I found some miniature candy," she 
says. "The group leader later told me, 'You should have seen all the joy it 
brought to those ladies.' " 
</P>
<P>
For her, the real reward comes in giving old, beautiful things a new life. 
</P>
<P>
"A woman brought a bunch of her old broken jewelry for me to make into earrings 
so she could leave them for her daughter," she says. Now her Earlooms have 
become family heirlooms.

4.7 AFTERSHOCK TRIGGERS SLIDE ON MT. BALDY, NO NEW DAMAGE 
</P>

<P>
A wide area of Southern California rolled today with a 4.7 aftershock of 
Wednesday's earthquake, triggering a rockslide on Mt. Baldy Road but no reports 
of significant damage or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The quake shook Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego counties. 
It also hit Orange County before President Bush addressed a noon anti-drug 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
The aftershock had a magnitude of 4.7 and struck at 9:26 a.m., said Robert 
Finn, spokesman for CalTech in Pasadena. An aftershock at 2:52 a.m. measured 
2.5. 
</P>
<P>
"It was scary and I'm shaking. But nothing fell or flew this time," said Melina 
Manning of Ontario, two miles south of the epicenter. "All the pans and the 
lights swayed back and forth. It was mild compared to the other day but very 
scary, especially because your nerves are shot from the other day." 
</P>
<P>
The aftershocks came as Southern Californians bounced by Wednesday's 5.5 quake, 
the largest to hit the region in more than two years, were sweeping up after 
millions of dollars in damage.

BUSH URGES TV WAR ON DRUGS; 
</P>
<P>
PRAISES O.C. ANTI-ABUSE CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
President Bush took his anti-drug campaign to Los Angeles and Santa Ana today, 
urging television producers to fight drug abuse through their programs and 
praising Orange County for its "Drug Use Is Life Abuse" campaign. 
</P>
<P>
While addressing members of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences in 
Century City, Bush was heckled briefly by two people, one of them shouting: 
"Why don't you ever talk about AIDS? Why don't you lead the country on AIDS?" 
Bush smiled and waited while hotel security officers hustled the two out of the 
ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
But in Santa Ana, where about 16,000 people jammed the municipal stadium, 
Bush's reception was uniformly adoring. The crowd, mostly schoolchildren and 
their teachers, were shouting and cheering even before Bush appeared at 12:20 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who thinks America lacks the will to win the drug war better take a 
look at the spirit we have here today in Orange County," Bush said in prepared 
remarks. "I know we'll win the war on drugs, because you have what a longtime 
resident of Orange County, John Wayne, had: true grit." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking earlier over breakfast in the Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles, Bush 
told TV producers that glorifying drug use is "fading fast" and called on them 
to be "a force for positive change." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not asking you to compromise your art" by portraying "a fantasy world 
where drugs don't exist," he said. Instead, "show in the real world how drugs 
destroy." 
</P>
<P>
He lauded an upcoming cartoon program called "Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue," 
a collaboration of several cartoon producers telling of a boy who turns away 
from drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Bush was flown to the Marine Corps Air Station at Tustin, then driven to 
the stadium, which had been full for nearly two hours. 
</P>
<P>
The audience was boisterous after more than an hour of pep rally, including 
Marine Corps and high school marching bands, cheerleaders and speeches from 
national and local celebrities, including actor Chuck Norris, who plugged his 
next film, and TV preacher Robert Schuller. 
</P>
<P>
In prepared remarks, Bush singled out Orange County's "Drug Abuse Is Life 
Abuse" campaign for praise. 
</P>
<P>
"Just two nights ago, right in Orange County, two cars were pulled over 
carrying nearly 900 pounds of cocaine. Thanks to your courageous anti-narcotics 
effort, 4 million doses with a street value of $30 million won't poison our 
kids. That's desire. That's determination." 
</P>
<P>
Bush was referring to a seizure Thursday morning in the Anaheim area by Orange 
County Sheriff's Department narcotics investigators. About 900 pounds of 
cocaine was taken from three vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Bush named two Orange County residents as heroes in the war against drugs: 
Henry Cousin, a Santa Ana police officer severely wounded three years ago in a 
drug raid, who as a federal officer was involved in the biggest drug raid in 
Orange County history, and Rosa Perez, a Santa Ana woman who has campaigned for 
six years to rid her Santa Ana neighborhood of drug trafficking.

The U.S. Army today said it has cut the number of patrols along West Germany's 
borders with East Germany and Czechoslovakia, which for decades formed the 
boundary line of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was the first sign of change in the traditional vigilance 
along the border and reflected the democratic change sweeping the East Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the Americans are responsible for a 630-mile stretch of the border, 
Staff Sgt. Elayne Venema said. Several hundred of the 250,000 U.S. troops 
stationed in West Germany have been involved in the day-to-day patrols in the 
area.

FULLERTON POLICE SHOOT ALLEGED ROBBER AFTER HIGH-SPEED CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Service Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who allegedly robbed a gasoline station's mini-market was in critical 
condition today after a shoot-out with police officers, a Fullerton spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
None of the officers were injured during the gun battle, which started about 
2:30 a.m. outside the AM-PM Mini Market at the intersection of Raymond and 
Orangethorpe avenues in Fullerton, city spokeswoman Sylvia Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
The man, who has not yet been identified by police, is suspected of being the 
robber who entered the market and held a clerk and two customers at gunpoint as 
he took money from the register, Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
Several minutes later, an officer, using the clerk's description of the car and 
robber, spotted the empty vehicle at a parking lot of another convenience store 
several miles away, she said. The man left the store and was beginning to get 
into the car when the officer flashed his red lights, the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The man moved away from the car and fired two shots at the officer, she said. 
The officer ducked and returned fire with two shotgun blasts, neither of which 
struck the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
The man got into the car and drove off, with the officer pursuing at speeds 
reaching 80 m.p.h., Palmer said. Another officer joined the chase, which ended 
when the man turned down Rolling Hills Drive -- a dead-end street -- and hit an 
embankment, she said. The man got out of the car and appeared to be reaching 
for a gun when the officers shot him several times, Palmer said.

KREMLIN TARGETED POPE, EX-KGB OFFICIAL SAYS

<P>
A former Soviet KGB official whose defection had remained secret for a decade 
says the Kremlin asked in 1979 for information that could be used to 
assassinate Pope John Paul II, according to an interview published today. 
</P>
<P>
The defector, Victor Sheymov, also told the Washington Post that the KGB once 
discussed whether to break the legs of ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev, who made 
anti-communist statements after his defection to the West in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
Sheymov, a KGB major in charge of communications security for the Soviet spy 
agency, had intimate knowledge of the KGB's most closely guarded coding 
systems, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
Allegations of Soviet involvement in a plot to assassinate the Pope surfaced 
after an attempt on the pontiff's life in 1981 by a Turkish gunman, but no 
connection to Moscow was ever firmly established. 
</P>
<P>
Sheymov said that during a trip to Poland in 1979, he learned of a cable from 
Yuri V. Andropov, at the time the head of the KGB and later general secretary 
of the Communist Party, that said, "Obtain all the information possible on how 
to get physically close to the Pope." 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone knew what it meant," Sheymov said. "It meant they wanted to 
assassinate the Pope." 
</P>
<P>
The idea of killing the Pope upset a KGB general who, according to Sheymov, 
complained, "If we do that, we'll have to kill them all (the Poles) or get out 
of here." 
</P>
<P>
Sheymov, who defected in May, 1980, with his wife and children, said that he 
told what he knew about Andropov's interest in the Pope to the CIA but that he 
does not know what the CIA did with it. 
</P>
<P>
For all his information, Sheymov was given a medal.

The political fortunes of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher plunged further 
today with the release of an opinion poll showing her Conservative Party 18.5% 
behind the opposition Labor Party, its lowest standing in 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
The survey undertaken by Gallup for the Daily Telegraph newspaper indicated 
that Thatcher's slide is due to a controversial new tax and her refusal to 
lower interest rates to spur economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
It showed 65% of people are dissatisfied with Thatcher as prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
The poll put the Labor Party of Neil Kinnock at 49.5%, a rise of 1.5% from two 
previous polls. 
</P>
<P>
It placed the Conservatives at 31%, their lowest standing since September, 
1971. 
</P>
<P>
The centrist Liberal Democrats have 7%, the environmentalist Green party 5.5% 
and others 7%.

<TEXT>
<P>
The trial of 21 former secret police and others opened today with the 
prosecution charging that, to cover up their crime, they stole and burned the 
corpses of 40 protesters they had killed. 
</P>
<P>
Local residents jeered the 21 defendants in this Transylvanian city, birthplace 
of the December revolution that swept dictator Nicolae Ceausescu from power in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
Official figures released at the hearing showed 94 people died in Timisoara 
during the pro-democracy demonstrations, 300 others were badly wounded and 23 
simply disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
The 21 defendants -- former Securitate officers, senior police officials and 
two Bucharest cemetery supervisors -- were led into the dock wearing 
beige-and-brown striped uniforms, the dress of convicts. Their heads were 
shaved. 
</P>
<P>
A small crowd booed and jeered as they pulled up in a police van flanked by 
armored cars. The courthouse was ringed by armored personnel carriers and about 
100 soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
The most senior Securitate officer on trial is Gen. Emil Macri, head of the 
security police's counterintelligence. He was sent from Bucharest to Timisoara 
by Ceausescu to quell the pro-democracy demonstrations, military prosecutor 
Mihai Radulescu said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Macri's first orders on arriving in Timisoara were effectively to 
isolate the city of 320,000 from the rest of the world. All roads around the 
city were blocked off, foreigners were barred and all telephone links were cut. 
</P>
<P>
The 21 face charges of complicity in genocide and assisting in genocide, and 
all face maximum terms of life imprisonment if found guilty by the three-man 
military tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
Reports that thousands of people had been killed by the Securitate in Timisoara 
in mid-December spread around the country, triggering the revolution. 
</P>
<P>
The initial figures were grossly exaggerated, but there were gasps in court 
today as prosecutors described how the bodies of 40 demonstrators had been 
disposed of. The corpses were reportedly stolen, cremated and their ashes 
tipped down a drain. 
</P>
<P>
On the night of Dec. 18, Timisoara's deputy chief of the Securitate, Maj. Ioan 
Corbodeanu, acting under Macri's orders, went to the district hospital where 
the bodies of protesters shot a day earlier were being kept, Radulescu told the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
Saying the Securitate was helping the hospital to make more space, Corbodeanu 
loaded the bodies into a truck that was driven to Bucharest, 300 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
All electricity in the hospital was switched off during the three-hour 
body-snatch. 
</P>
<P>
In Bucharest the bodies were taken to the city's main crematory where four 
workers were paid the equivalent of $20 to "forget" what they had seen.

FORECASTING GAUGE IN JAN. UNCHANGED; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: CURRENT SLUGGISHNESS BELIEVED LIKELY TO EXTEND INTO MIDYEAR.

<P>
The government's chief economic forecasting gauge was flat in January, the 
Commerce Department said today in a further indication that the economy's 
current sluggishness will extend into midyear. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of change in the index of leading economic indicators, designed to 
forecast economic activity six to nine months in advance, followed a revised 
0.6% gain in December and a 0.1% advance in November. The index fell 0.4% in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
Many economists had expected a slight increase in the January index. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the 11 forward-looking statistics helped keep the index stable, led by 
a sharp increase in building permits during the warmest January on record. 
</P>
<P>
Others showing strength were slower business delivery times and an increase in 
the backlog of manufacturers' unfilled orders. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest drag on the index in January was a decline in orders for consumer 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
Other negatives were a drop in the money supply, a decline in plant and 
equipment orders, lower stock prices, a decrease in the price of raw materials, 
a drop in an index measuring consumer confidence and an increase in weekly 
unemployment claims. 
</P>
<P>
One indicator, the length of the average workweek, was unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
The various changes left the index at 145.3% of its 1982 base of 100. The index 
rose 0.8% from August through January after falling 0.7% the previous six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
The December index originally was reported to have risen 0.8% but was revised 
downward to 0.6%, largely because of lower orders for consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the sluggishness, recent surveys indicate that business executives and 
economists generally believe the Federal Reserve is driving the economy down 
the right road, steering it away from a recession while braking the growth of 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy-two percent of the professional forecasters responding to a poll by the 
National Assn. of Business Economists said the central bank is on the right 
track. 
</P>
<P>
And 56% of the business leaders participating in a survey by the National Assn. 
of Manufacturers said Fed policies are "just about right." 
</P>
<P>
But most of the business leaders and economists surveyed project continued 
sluggish growth in 1990 as the Fed keeps interest rates relatively high to slow 
the economy and keep prices under control.

JAPAN POSTS $636-MILLION TRADE DEFICIT, ITS FIRST IN SIX YEARS

<P>
Japan reported a trade deficit for the first time in six years today with a 
current account shortfall for the month of January, but economists said Tokyo 
is expected to return to a trade surplus soon. 
</P>
<P>
The current account, the broadest measure of trade in goods and services, was 
$636 million in deficit after a $2.51-billion surplus a year earlier, the 
Finance Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's last deficit, of $562 million, was recorded in January, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said factors involved in the decrease, such as the initial depressing 
effects of a weaker yen on trade, higher oil prices and slowing auto exports, 
will continue at least for the first quarter of 1990. But they saw no cause for 
alarm. 
</P>
<P>
"The drop was largely due to seasonal factors," said Nobuyuki Saji, senior 
economist at Nikko Securities Research Centre. "It's nothing to get excited 
about."

Sales of new homes plummeted 7.1% in January to the lowest level in nearly a 
year, as both mortgage rates and prices continued to climb, the government said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said new single-family homes were sold at a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 589,000 units in January after falling 8.4% in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
December sales originally were reported to have dropped 9.6%. It was the worst 
performance since sales fell to 556,000 homes on an annual basis last March. 
</P>
<P>
It marked an ominous start for the new year after new-home sales slowed to 
650,000 units in 1989, down 3.8% from 1988 and the lowest level since 639,000 
homes were purchased in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Realtors reported Wednesday that sales of existing homes, 
which represent about 80% of the housing market, dropped 2.2% in January. The 
real estate group blamed higher mortgage rates and the usual January buying 
lull for the drop. 
</P>
<P>
Interest rates rose from 9.83% to 10.05% in January. Rates continued to rise in 
February, reaching 10.31% by last Friday.

Bob Newhart said today that he'll say goodby to Vermont after eight seasons as 
innkeeper and talk show host Dick Loudon on CBS' Monday night comedy "Newhart." 
The series will end production in April with the filming of its 184th episode. 
</P>
<P>
CBS advised both Newhart and MTM that it wished the series to continue into a 
ninth year, but demands made by MTM, the British- owned television company 
which produces "Newhart," complicated the deal, according to an MTM spokesman. 
Discussions are already underway between CBS and Newhart's representatives for 
a series commitment to be activated within a year or two. 
</P>
<P>
"Our series was the perfect example of how much fun episodic television can be. 
We've had a wonderful cast, great writers and the spirit of family which made 
coming to work a pleasure," said Newhart. 
</P>
<P>
"If my experience in ending this series is similar to one I had upon completion 
of 'The Bob Newhart Show' (1972-1978), I know that first I'll miss the 
comraderie of the group, second, I'll enjoy several months of rest and playing 
stand-up performances around the country, and then I'll be anxious to develop 
another project that brings me back to television." 
</P>
<P>
Newhart has starred in other television series: The original "The Bob Newhart 
Show," comedy and music series in the early '60s; "The Entertainers," an hour 
variety program in the late '60s; the previously mentioned "The Bob Newhart 
Show," where he played Chicago psychologist Bob Hartley.

Malcolm Forbes' memorial services in New York at St. Bartholomew's Church on 
Thursday included most of the things he had liked best -- the swirl of 
bagpipes, the choral hunting horns and the men in red coats imported from 
France to play them, the discipline and devotion of his four adult sons and his 
daughter, each of whom spoke the only personal words in the epic-long (1 hour 
and 45 minutes) Episcopal service. Malcolm would have been proud of these 
children because not one of them broke down, though others watching did as they 
said their farewells to the man they called "Pop." 
</P>
<P>
A baby cried through some of the service -- one of Malcolm's progeny, I have no 
doubt. He'd have liked that, too. His huge family filled seven rows in front on 
the right, and behind them were hundreds of Forbes' employees. And Malcolm 
would have, of course, liked the titans of industry who came to say goodby, men 
such as John Kluge, Allen Neuharth and Lee Iacocca. And the presence of the 
former mayor of New York, Ed Koch. Malcolm would have adored all the police 
uniforms, as well as the claque of booted motorcycle bikers in the back of the 
church. Then there was the soft, ongoing click and whir of cameras from an 
overhanging balcony crammed with "social historians." Malcolm would have 
insisted on it, in fact. 
</P>
<P>
THE PUBLISHER, editor, writer would have enjoyed the Rev. Thomas Bowers' 
reminder that we are all dust and that John Dunne's bell tolls not just for 
Malcolm, but for you and me, too. 
</P>
<P>
There were lots of famous women, and Malcolm liked famous women. There was 
Katharine Graham of the Washington Post and Barbara Walters of television and 
Brooke Astor of philanthropy and Joan Rivers of fun, games and comedy. Malcolm 
would have embraced a service where we got to sing all six, full verses of "The 
Battle Hymn of the Republic" (it's never done) with all the "Glory, Glory, 
Hallelujahs" in between. He loved music. 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm would have smiled over the waiting crowds, the police barricades, the 
fanfare on Park Avenue and the snarl of Manhattan traffic. 
</P>
<P>
AND I think, most of all, he'd have loved the fact that he had a President of 
the United States and one of the greatest film legends who ever lived sitting 
next to each other in the front row. Former President Richard Nixon came with 
his daughter, Tricia Cox, and they were joined just before the service began by 
a subdued Elizabeth Taylor, who appeared from a side door. She looked quite 
beautiful and smiled sadly at the children's remembrances. 
</P>
<P>
But as the service ended and Glenn Ellison's bagpipes, playing "Amazing Grace," 
faded away, I saw Nixon lean toward Taylor and heard him say, "I want to thank 
you for the joy and beauty, the help and companionship, the enthusiasm and 
wonderful times you brought to the latter part of Malcolm's life as a friend." 
</P>
<P>
If this was eavesdropping -- and it was -- I couldn't help it. And I know 
Malcolm would want every such scrap recorded for posterity. Oh, Malcolm, you 
canny Scot, we'll never see your like again! 
</P>
<P>
THE CBS rumor mill is agog over the newcomer co-host of "CBS This Morning" -- 
Paula Zahn -- and "her extraordinary contract," plus the fact that her start-up 
has been so sensational. Plus the fact that she'll get to sub for Dan Rather 
when he is anchors away. Plus the fact that she has two specials written into 
her future.

Jerry Hall made her London stage debut this week in a revival of "Bus Stop," 
playing singer Cherie, the role Marilyn Monroe made famous in the 1956 movie 
version of the William Inge play. Hall's boyfriend, Mick Jagger, didn't make 
the show because he's touring Japan with the Rolling Stones, but Jade Jagger, 
the singer's daughter from his marriage to Bianca Jagger, was on hand. Hall 
also played the Cherie role in a New Jersey theater and Jagger caught her act 
there.

Davey Allison passed out today after an impromptu wrestling match with a crew 
member during a rain delay at North Carolina Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
Allison, 29, the son of longtime NASCAR Winston Cup star Bobby Allison, quickly 
regained consciousness and was checked out at the track's infield care center. 
</P>
<P>
He walked out of the care center, but, at his father's urging, was taken by 
private plane to Charlotte Memorial Hospital, about 75 miles away, for further 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Yates, the owner and manager of the younger Allison's team, said, 
"During the rain, Davey was playing around, wrestling with one of the guys, got 
held in a headlock, and a couple of minutes later, Davey passed out." 
</P>
<P>
Hut Stricklin, who does not have a ride for Sunday's Goodwrench 500 here, was 
asked to drive Allison's Ford Thunderbird in the afternoon practice session.

PETE ROSE JR. TAKES OPTIMISTIC VIEWPOINT;

<P>
Pete Rose Jr., ever the optimist, says there's a bright side to the lifetime 
suspension given his famous father. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll get to see me play more," said the 20-year-old Rose, who plays in the 
Baltimore Orioles' minor-league system. "I hope he gets to see me play every 
game. I want to show him my appreciation for him. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to say, 'Hey, Dad, look what you did, you made me into a great 
ballplayer.' He knows I'm a good player, but I'd like to open his eyes more 
than I already have." 
</P>
<P>
The younger Rose expects to hear hecklers this season, along with more 
questions about his father's August, 1989, ban from baseball on gambling 
allegations. Rose Jr. said he also anticipates remarks from people who say his 
name, not his skills, got him to pro ball. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm always going to hear it," he said. "Guaranteed." 
</P>
<P>
But Rose, who reports March 12 to Miami for his second season as a minor 
leaguer, isn't worried. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm ready to go," Rose said. "I'm a little bit bored. I'm ready to go down to 
spring training and get started, then get the season under way." 
</P>
<P>
The younger Rose began his pro career just as the investigation of his father's 
gambling came to a head last year. He struggled in his rookie season with 
Frederick, Md., a Class A team. By mid-May, he was hitting .133 and had lost 
his spot in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"We asked an awful lot of him to put him in Carolina league," Baltimore Player 
Personnel Director Doug Melvin said. "That was an error in judgment on our 
part." 
</P>
<P>
"Ninety percent of the kids out of high school are going to struggle," said Roy 
Krasik, assistant player development director. "It's a big adjustment, with 
travel and being away from home." 
</P>
<P>
Rose reduced the problem to baseball terms: "I had one problem, getting my 
hands started. And I wasn't playing every day. That was a bigger problem than 
my swing." 
</P>
<P>
After extended spring training and reassignment in June to Erie in the New 
York-Penn league, he hit .276 in 58 games and led the team with 15 doubles, 
five triples and 26 RBI. His father played his first pro season in the same 
league 29 years earlier, hitting .277 for Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball America, a guide to minor-league baseball, picked the younger Rose as 
the eighth-best prospect in the N.Y.-Penn league. 
</P>
<P>
"He kept improving," Krasik said. "He's aggressive and he comes to the ballpark 
ready to play every day." 
</P>
<P>
Krasik said Rose Jr. is a hard worker who could make it in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who works that hard has the potential to make it," Krasik said.

ALLEGATIONS ADD PRESSURE ON VALVANO; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: EDITORIALS CALL FOR N.C. STATE COACH TO QUIT. MEANWHILE, THE STATE 
STARTS A FORMAL INQUIRY INTO REPORTS OF POINT-SHAVING.

<TEXT>
<P>
Calls for Coach Jim Valvano's resignation intensified today as North Carolina 
State basketball players and their possible ties to point-shaving allegations 
became subjects of a formal state inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
The State Bureau of Investigation acknowledged that its preliminary look into 
rumors of gambling and point-shaving has turned into a full investigation, 
initiated at the request of Wake County Dist. Atty. Colon Willoughby. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, ABC News reported that "inside sources" had said that as many as 
four Wolfpack players, including Charles Shackleford, now of the New Jersey 
Nets, conspired to hold down the scores of four games for betting purposes 
during the 1987-88 season. Shackleford's lawyer and agent, Sal DiFazio of 
Bridgewater, N.J., has said his client never shaved points. 
</P>
<P>
ABC said that one of the games was against Wake Forest on March 6, 1988. State 
defeated Wake Forest by four points after being favored by 16. 
</P>
<P>
Shackleford has admitted accepting $65,000 from two men during the 1986-87 and 
'87-88 seasons at N.C. State. One of the men, Robert Kramer of Denville, N.J., 
acknowledged giving Shackleford money, but said it was a loan that was repaid. 
</P>
<P>
Though Valvano is not mentioned in the allegations and has denied knowledge of 
point-shaving, two state newspapers and the student paper called for his 
ouster. 
</P>
<P>
"For the sake of a great sport and a great institution, Jim Valvano has to go. 
Now," The Charlotte Observer said today. 
</P>
<P>
"For Coach Jim Valvano, it's only a matter of time. The game is over," said the 
Winston-Salem Journal. 
</P>
<P>
Some faculty members also circulated a petition urging his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
N.C. State already is on two years' probation for violations that included the 
sale of complimentary tickets and sneakers. Those infractions already cost 
Valvano his job as athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
Valvano was expected to return to the Raleigh campus from New York by late 
afternoon today for a team practice. His agent, Art Kaminksy, was unavailable 
for comment but an associate, Pat Gibbons, said the coach "obviously is 
disturbed and shocked by what he's hearing. Other than that, he's not 
commenting. It's all pretty disturbing on the heels of all that's happened in 
the last 12 months. He's a tough guy. He'll handle it." 
</P>
<P>
But some people in North Carolina think something should be done before the 
investigation ends. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is, there are just too many unfortunate things that have 
happened during his tenure," William Johnson, a member emeritus of the 
university system's Board of Governors, told The Observer. "I think in order to 
wipe away the stain, there's got to be a general cleaning out." 
</P>
<P>
Acting Chancellor Larry K. Monteith said he would not suggest any action be 
taken against Valvano until a review of the basketball program -- started about 
a year ago -- is completed.

DERBY HOPEFULS HARD TO PEG THUS FAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The yellow brick road to Louisville looks like the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway 
with a lane closed. Intriguing 3-year-olds, it seems, are everywhere; there is 
great congestion and a smattering of anxiety but little forward motion. No 
horns blare but the sound of guessing and second-guessing is beginning to 
build. 
</P>
<P>
With traffic stalled and only nine Saturdays left before the Kentucky Derby, 
the rumor mill is agush. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall, who will be absent from the Fountain of Youth Stakes on Saturday 
at Gulfstream Park, either bled mildly in a recent workout or gushed like a 
sieve, depending upon whom you speak to. Similarly, Summer Squall, who was 
undefeated in five races at 2, is either completely sound after knee surgery or 
training more tenderly every day. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing that seemed certain on the eve of the Eastern season's first 
graded two-turn stakes for 3-year-olds was that it will be some time before 
anything is certain. Undefeated Champagneforashley has yet to enter the picture 
and undefeated Mister Frisky must be watched in the California preps. With 
luck, the traffic will begin to break up soon, perhaps Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen were entered for the 1 1/16-mile Fountain of Youth, four of them major 
Triple Crown figures. Another important ingredient in this melange, Red Ransom, 
is entered at Gulfstream for the second consecutive Saturday and will make his 
long-awaited 3-year-old debut in a seven-furlong allowance race. Well, maybe. 
It might rain. 
</P>
<P>
Red Ransom was scratched from an allowance race against older horses Saturday 
when trainer Mack Miller decided his final pre-race work had been too fast to 
allow complete recovery. The colt, sensational in his two races last season, 
worked a much more conservative 48 1/5 half-mile under a heavy exercise rider 
Thursday and is one of 13 late nominees to the Grade I Florida Derby in two 
weeks, a race not in the conservative Miller's original plan. 
</P>
<P>
Slavic, who won a 1 1/16-mile allowance race in a solid season's debut, is the 
favorite to win the Fountain of Youth over a field that includes 1989 
2-year-old champion Rhythm, Remsen champion Yonder and Young America winner 
Roanoke, who will make his first start of the year. It is a race that mirrors 
the division, since it would be no surprise if any of these colts won the 
Fountain of Youth and only mildly surprising if none of them won. 
</P>
<P>
Late-running Yonder comes off a big move into a slow last quarter, finishing 
second in the seven-furlong Hutcheson. Trainer Woody Stephens expects a repeat 
performance, but frets over the pace. "He won't get any better," Stephens said. 
"He was dead fit for the Hutcheson, fittest horse in the field. But he needs a 
fast pace." 
</P>
<P>
Rhythm was a disappointing seventh in the Hutcheson but has since worked well. 
Trainer Shug McGaughey will likely learn much about the colt's Derby prospects 
Saturday. Roanoke, a huge, rangy colt, will probably need a race or two before 
coming into form. And Slavic, whom trainer Scotty Schulhofer said is "as good a 
3-year-old as I've ever been around," may be a step or two away from his best 
form.

<P>
CELEBRATION: PRESIDENT BUSH HELPS THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT DEDICATE A HIGH-TECH 
JAIL IN CASTAIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The maximum-security county jail in Castaic dubbed "Super Max" by President 
Bush when he opened it Thursday is a state-of-the-art facility that was 
designed with the help of the officers who will guard its 2,064 inmates. 
</P>
<P>
A giant security complex consisting of five smaller jails, the $134-million 
North County Correctional Facility is on 34 acres of the Peter J. Pitchess 
Honor Rancho, which already houses about 7,500 minimum-, medium- and 
maximum-security inmates. 
</P>
<P>
The facility will ease crowding at 10 county jails, which, as of Thursday, held 
close to 23,000 inmates. These jails have a state-rated capacity of 13,464, 
said Deputy Rafael Estrada, a department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said the facility's 
electronic surveillance and control system will allow fewer deputies to keep 
watch over more inmates. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the average inmate-to-staff ratio is 3.4 to 1. At the County Jail, 
the ratio will be 5.8 inmates to 1, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A central computer system can lock and unlock all doors in the 
681,422-square-foot complex, from individual cells to the main entrance of the 
administration building. The control center has 28 television monitors hooked 
up to 128 cameras stationed strategically throughout the complex. 
</P>
<P>
A committee of sheriff's deputies helped engineers decide where to place the 
television cameras to avoid blind spots common in other jails, said Deputy 
Gregory Frum, an Honor Rancho guard and committee member. 
</P>
<P>
Frum, who stood guard at the entrance, where Bush arrived by helicopter, said 
deputies particularly wanted cameras stationed in all hallways. "It will cut 
down on inmate fights," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After Bush delivered brief remarks saluting the jail and the Sheriff's 
Department, hundreds of people from the audience of 1,600 toured the facility, 
which is expected to begin receiving inmates March 8. But as one sheriff's 
deputy dryly noted to two women on the tour, "We were supposed to get our first 
prisoners a year ago." 
</P>
<P>
Last spring's opening was delayed when engineers discovered that the complex 
computer system could not lock doors on command. For a time, toilets would not 
flush because soil and particles in the Honor Rancho well water clogged the 
pipes. 
</P>
<P>
The jail was built with $131 million provided by state and county bond measures 
for jail construction. In December, the Board of Supervisors approved an 
additional $2.7 million to complete the latest expansion project at the Honor 
Rancho. Two years ago, the county officials opened a 1,600-bed, medium-security 
jail.

ARABIAN TAKES OATH FOR STATE HIGH COURT; 
</P>
<P>
JUDICIARY: THE COLORFUL LOS ANGELES JURIST WAS AN EARLY ADVOCATE OF RAPE-LAW 
REFORM. HE GIVES ASSURANCES THAT HE WILL NOT SOON LEAVE THE BELEAGUERED PANEL. 
</P>

<P>
Appellate Justice Armand Arabian, a combative and colorful Los Angeles jurist 
and an early advocate of rape-law reform, was sworn in Thursday as the 105th 
member of the California Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Nominated by Gov. George Deukmejian, his longtime friend, Arabian took the oath 
of office from Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas moments after he was confirmed 
unanimously by the three-member state Judicial Appointments Commission, meeting 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old Arabian, the son of Armenian immigrants who lived in a tenement 
on New York City's lower East Side, joins four other Deukmejian appointees who 
have helped form the moderately conservative majority that has led the court 
since the defeat of Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird and two others in the 
November, 1986, election. 
</P>
<P>
Arabian gave strong assurances he would not soon leave a high court that is 
struggling with a heavy backlog of death-penalty cases -- 185 by recent count 
-- and that has seen two justices resign recently after less than three years 
in office. Rumors persist that even more court members are considering 
resignation, threatening further disruption. 
</P>
<P>
He told the commission -- composed of Lucas, Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp and 
Senior Presiding Court of Appeal Justice Lester W. Roth -- that he had assured 
Deukmejian he would not accept the appointment had he planned to spend only "a 
couple" of years on the high court. 
</P>
<P>
Later, he told reporters that if confirmed by the voters next fall, he expects 
to stay on at least through his remaining eight-year term. "In my present state 
of mind, I intend to serve as long and as well as I can," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In his own brief remarks to the commission, Arabian gave repeated assurances 
that he had made no commitments to the governor on how he might rule on cases 
and asserted he is looking forward to service on the high court despite its 
demanding workload. 
</P>
<P>
He likened his appearance before the commission to the moments before 
parachuting from an airplane -- an allusion to his military service as an Army 
paratrooper. Arabian said afterward that he has continued in recent years to 
make occasional jumps with an international organization of airborne veterans. 
"People have asked me why I continue to do that," he said. "I think it's good 
to get out of the ivory tower, get the cobwebs out of your brains, go out with 
the boys and have a little adventure." 
</P>
<P>
Arabian's seven years on the state Court of Appeal in Los Angeles were marked 
by a broad variety of rulings that reflected his fondness for expansive, 
stylish judicial writing. In one decision, he quoted both William Shakespeare 
and Harry S. Truman.

Legal observers say they expect Arabian to fit comfortably with the court's 
moderate-to-conservative majority. But the experts do not rule out the 
possibility that he will emerge on occasion as a somewhat unpredictable "wild 
card" -- similar to the man he succeeded, retiring Justice Marcus M. Kaufman. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times, Arabian himself cautioned against applying 
either the label conservative or liberal to his 18-year record as a Municipal, 
Superior and Appeal Court judge. He cited, for example, a range of cases where 
criminal defendants had both won and lost. 
</P>
<P>
"On any given day, the case will dictate the label," he said. "I know there's a 
great thirst, especially in the journalistic community, to label somebody -- 
but these labels are relatively meaningless. . . . Depending on the case, call 
me what you will." 
</P>
<P>
Arabian declined to state a personal position on the death penalty, but noted 
that as a former Los Angeles deputy district attorney and, later, a criminal 
defense lawyer, he has both prosecuted and defended those accused of capital 
crimes. Twice, as a judge, he sentenced defendants to the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is resigned to accepting a heavy workload that stems from the 
court's extensive backlog of pending capital appeals. But he joined other legal 
authorities who have urged a change in the law to permit such cases to go first 
to the Court of Appeal -- where the voluminous case records and complex issues 
can be reviewed and clarified -- instead of being sent directly to the high 
court, as they are now. 
</P>
<P>
Arabian's friendship with Deukmejian dates back to the 1960s when, as lawyers, 
the two became acquainted while representing opposing sides in a divorce case. 
Arabian became a member of Deukmejian's unofficial "kitchen cabinet," meeting 
periodically to discuss the future governor's political plans. 
</P>
<P>
Later, after he was appointed to the bench in 1972 by Gov. Ronald Reagan, 
Arabian worked with then-legislator Deukmejian on bills that mandated prison 
for first-time rape offenders and strengthened the penalty for rape by an 
instrument. 
</P>
<P>
Arabian won wide attention for a pioneering decision in which he refused to 
give jurors a since-abandoned instruction to view a rape victim's testimony 
with added caution. The instruction later was invalidated by the state Supreme 
Court. To have given the instruction, he said in the interview, "would have 
plunged a dagger into the heart of the lady of justice." 
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's hearing, Arabian's nomination drew enthusiastic support from 
Appellate Justice George Danielson of Los Angeles; Encino attorney Ellis J. 
Horvitz; Los Angeles County Public Defender Wilbur Littlefield, and attorney 
Janice Reznik, past president of the California Women Lawyers Assn.
