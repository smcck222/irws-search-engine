A Swiss newspaper report suggested that Romania is secretly trying to sell off 
Western shipments of humanitarian food aid to get U.S. dollars. Neue Zuercher 
Zeitung, a Zurich newspaper, said its information came from documents received 
from Romania. It said they indicated that a foreign trade agency in the 
Romanian capital had offered North Korea, a Communist ally, a discounted 
shipment of rice, flour and other foods for payment in dollars. Romanian 
authorities thus stand accused "of seizing Western aid shipments for the 
starving, freezing population and bartering them away for hard currency," the 
newspaper said. Officials at the Romanian Embassy in Bern said they were not 
aware of any problem.

President Bush, who must be doing his homework, faced a room full of 53 
educators and wasn't sent to the blackboard once. In a White House ceremony, 
Bush saluted the outstanding 53 teachers selected by the National Endowment for 
the Humanities for a year of independent study in their respective fields, and 
even got a few laughs from the bunch. "When I read about the subjects you'll be 
studying next fall I had two feelings -- one respect, and the other delight 
that I already graduated," quipped Bush, who has vowed to be the "education 
President." "I'm flattered to be in the company of the most important members 
of the most important profession." The teachers, one from each state, the 
District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, were selected from 
615 applicants and will receive grants of up to $27,500.

 -- Has the mutt become a couch potato? Sherry Wall of Brown Deer, Wis., is 
exhorting dog owners to pay the same attention to their canines' fitness as 
they do to their Jane Fonda tapes. Wall, a veterinary technician, has received 
dozens of calls since she began advertising her aerobic exercise course that 
includes doggy push-ups and sit-ups. Soon she will be pushing the pooches to 
feel the burn in regular classes at a suburban Milwaukee shopping mall. The 
desired result? A dog-tired dog. Can quadruped aerobics shoes from Reebok be 
far behind?

 -- Her babies come into the world with a strike against them. But that doesn't 
daunt Clara Hale, who has taken in and nurtured more than 600 drug-addicted 
babies at her Hale House in New York City. In recognition of her work with the 
infants, born chemically dependent because of their mothers' addiction, Hale, 
83, has been named the 1989 winner of the Truman Award for Public Service. As a 
foster parent, Hale raised more than 40 children in Harlem from 1941 to 1968. 
The following year, she took in her first addicted baby. The Hale House 
provides a temporary home for the children, who are usually reunited with their 
mothers after the parent has undergone drug rehabilitation.

 -- The Smithsonian Institution in Washington, one of the more eclectic 
repositories of the noteworthy, acquired 466,181 items last year, including 
jazzman Buddy Rich's drums, a 12.3-pound golden-yellow topaz and the complete 
skeleton of a shark from Kansas. The acquisitions joined the Smithsonian's 
collection of 134 million objects, most of them scientific specimens housed in 
the National Museum of Natural History for study by researchers. One of the 
more unusual items was the Kansas shark skeleton, which dated from a time when 
the state was submerged by ocean waters between 65 million and 100 million 
years ago, said Dr. Nicholas Hotton, a research curator at the Natural History 
Museum. Also finding shelf space in the collection were bumper stickers, 
posters and lapel buttons from the 1988 Democratic and Republican presidential 
campaigns, and the skulls and skins of five wombats, the small bear-like 
creatures of Tasmania. ANN CONNORS

South and North Korean officials met for nearly three hours but failed to make 
any progress toward setting up a meeting of their prime ministers because of 
differences over joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises. But they agreed to 
meet again April 12 at the truce village of Panmunjom, 35 miles north of Seoul. 
The north wants the annual exercises scrapped.

Britain said it has received two Iranian requests for a meeting in Geneva to 
resolve the furor over author Salman Rushdie and his novel "The Satanic Verses" 
but that it will reject any such request until Tehran renounces violence over 
the book. Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe said there could be no justification 
for Iran's death threats against the author, even though the book is "deeply 
offensive" to Muslims. Iran denied proposing a meeting, saying that the 
overtures for conciliation came from Britain and the Rushdie remains subject to 
"divine offensive." Howe plans to meet in Vienna on Monday with Soviet Foreign 
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who has indicated a willingness to mediate the 
dispute.

OXNARD DROPS BUSING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oxnard School District trustees decided to dismantle an 18-year-old, 
court-ordered busing plan despite objections from parents and teachers. School 
board members, who approved the move by a 3-2 vote, argued that returning to 
neighborhood schools will save money and stem white flight in the district, 
where the Anglo population has been dropping steadily over the last two 
decades. The new plan's opponents contended that it will result in a return to 
segregated schools. Oxnard was one of five California cities under a U.S. 
District Court mandate to integrate its schools, but the district won a 
judicial release from the order in 1987.

Soviet Jewish emigration continued at a high rate in February with 2,226 
arrivals in the West, the Intergovernmental Committee for Migration reported in 
Geneva. The figure brought to 4,842 the total for the first two months of 1989. 
Although down slightly from the January figure of 2,616, the number of Soviet 
Jews allowed to leave by Moscow in February was still far higher than last 
year's monthly average of 1,673. By contrast, the monthly average in 1987 was 
668, and it was only 79 in 1986. Meanwhile, in Moscow, a group of about 20 
Soviet Jews staged their first protest in half a year, gathering near the 
Kremlin to accuse the government of violating global human rights agreements by 
barring their emigration. Police made no move to halt the protest.

A flight attendant and a passenger of ill-fated United Airlines Flight 811 have 
filed lawsuits in Honolulu over the Feb. 24 disaster that killed nine 
passengers who were sucked out of a gaping hole in a jumbo jet. Flight 
attendant May Sapolu sued Boeing Co., the plane's manufacturer, in state court 
and passenger Edwin Tudor of Australia filed suit against United Airlines in 
federal court. Tudor was sitting in row 27 and "could see the hole" but was not 
close to it, said his attorney, John Carroll. Tudor has complained of 
pulmonary, hearing and post-trauma disorders. Sapolu, the flight attendant, was 
smashed to the floor and hung onto the leg of a chair to keep from being swept 
out of the plane, said her lawyer, Rick Fried Jr.

Emergency legislation to provide $24.5 million to keep open 21 centers for the 
mentally retarded and developmentally disabled was signed by Gov. George 
Deukmejian. The funding crisis developed as a result of a dispute between the 
Deukmejian Administration and the federal government over funding of the 
centers. The legislation sponsored by Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) provides 
that the Administration can use money from the state General Fund or borrow it 
from another state-controlled fund until there is a resolution of the dispute.

IRAQ DEATH SQUADS ASSAILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amnesty International accused Iraq and five other countries of the widespread 
use of death squads. The London-based group told the U.N. Human Rights 
Commission in Geneva that most death squads, while appearing to operate 
independently, actually are set up by government security forces and are 
directed and manned by soldiers or police. The human rights group singled out 
Iraq as having the worst reputation for use of the squads -- "clearly and 
incontrovertibly, (it) presents a situation of the most flagrant and massive 
violation of human rights" -- but it also named Colombia, El Salvador, Peru, 
Ethiopia and Burma.

 MAN SENTENCED FOR POCKETING DONATIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
A Westwood man has been sentenced to nine months in jail for pocketing 
contributions he solicited on behalf of the Society for the Prevention of 
Cruelty to Animals and a Fairfax district temple. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Lonberger, 38, was sentenced by Municipal Court Commissioner Joseph 
Spada after pleading no contest to one count of forgery and two counts of false 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Lonberger was hired on Dec. 29 to organize a fund-raising event for the SPCA, 
which advanced him $2,000 for expenses, Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn 
said. The agreement was canceled a week later, but Lonberger continued to use 
the group's name to solicit contributions, Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
The forgery charge involved Lonberger's alteration of a check to Temple Beth 
Am, he said. Spada scheduled a March 23 hearing to determine what restitution 
Lonberger should pay.

Driving examiner Ramona Gonzales had already decided to flunk the novice behind 
the wheel for failing to change lanes properly. But the worst maneuver of the 
test was yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
The upset driver, a 28-year-old woman, was executing a turn into the parking 
lot of the Department of Motor Vehicles headquarters in Glendale when the car 
suddenly accelerated, crashing into the building. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I knew it, we were in the wall and she was crying," said Gonzales, 46. 
"We didn't even get to the parking part of the test." 
</P>
<P>
"I think she already knew she failed the test," the examiner said. "I guess she 
was nervous. She couldn't speak English, and she had trouble telling her left 
from right." 
</P>
<P>
The failed driver was uninjured, but Gonzales suffered a sprained right wrist. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the examiner learned that the novice had flunked two previous tests over 
the last eight months. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody warned me," Gonzales said. "Usually other examiners will tip each other 
off." 
</P>
<P>
It's no doubt a sign of the times that the "D.A. Crossword Puzzle" in the 
latest newsletter of the Los Angeles County district attorney's office is 
preoccupied with drug-oriented clues, including "Major Narcotics or Hardcore" 
(9 down), "Pro-Marijuana Organization" (7 down) "Carole of Major Narcotics" (15 
across), "Quantity of Cocaine" (14 across), and, of course, "Nose" (4 down). 
</P>
<P>
Lady Who? has been replaced by the Goddess Pomona in the seal of the Los 
Angeles County assessor's office. But the old emblem remains a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
"It pictured a woman holding the scales but it wasn't Lady Justice," said 
Robert Knowles, a spokesman for the office. "We couldn't figure out who it was, 
or what she was supposed to represent. The seal also pictured a church, and we 
don't tax churches." 
</P>
<P>
Knowles redesigned the emblem, which depicts "oil wells, industry, the harbor 
and other things that we tax. And we added the phrase, Equitas Est Libertas 
(Equality, or Fairness, is Freedom)." 
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece of the new assessor emblem, which is used on department 
stationery, is the county seal, which features Pomona, the Roman goddess of the 
orchards. 
</P>
<P>
And the woman in the old seal? 
</P>
<P>
"We asked around," Knowles said, "and it seems that she was a red-haired 
secretary who worked for a previous assessor." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History should send someone 
next door to the Poison Prevention Exhibit when it opens at the California 
Museum of Science and Industry in two weeks.

A dozen employees were evacuated from the natural history museum Thursday after 
some containers holding poisonous granules of sodium arsenite and arsenic 
trioxide fell to the floor and broke. There were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Museum spokeswoman Maryann Dunn said a workman was moving a box containing the 
granules when the bottom gave way. "Employees are under specific directions to 
move such materials in plastic containers," Dunn said, "but the rule was not 
observed this time." 
</P>
<P>
Radio talk show host Tom Leykis doesn't plan to burn old Cat Stevens records, 
after all. 
</P>
<P>
He says he's going to crush them. 
</P>
<P>
Which may or may not make any difference to the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. 
</P>
<P>
The KFI radio personality deferred to air pollution laws and on Thursday 
advised his listeners to send in their Stevens records for a public crunch-out 
(rather than a bonfire) next Wednesday as a demonstration against Stevens' 
support of Khomeini's death sentence against novelist Salman Rushdie, author of 
"The Satanic Verses." 
</P>
<P>
Stevens became a Muslim convert in 1979 and changed his name to Yousuf Islam. 
</P>
<P>
Fellow KFI talk show host Geoff Edwards has been suspended by the station for 
refusing to promote the Leykis stunt on the grounds that censorship is 
censorship.

<P>
More proof that a few hundredths of an inch of rain brings Los Angeles to a 
virtual standstill: A scheduled tour by Mayor Tom Bradley of a new attraction 
at the Los Angeles Zoo was postponed Thursday because of the wet stuff. 
</P>
<P>
The attraction, we're sad to say: Adventure Island.

<P>
VAN PLUNGES INTO RAVINE; DRIVER DIES

<P>
A Van Nuys man who drove to the top of a mountain in Angeles National Forest to 
make repairs at a communications facility was killed when his van plunged 2,000 
feet into a ravine, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Fish, a 57-year-old General Telephone equipment installer and repairer, 
did not return Wednesday from a late afternoon repair run to a microwave 
facility on top of Mt. Lukens, north of La Canada Flintridge, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
GTE reported him missing Thursday morning, and a Los Angeles County sheriff's 
rescue team began a search of the rugged terrain, Sgt. Ernie Roop said. 
</P>
<P>
The van and Fish's body were found below Mt. Lukens Road at 10:50 a.m., about 
two hours after the search began. 
</P>
<P>
Roop said it appeared that Fish was returning from his assignment when the van 
went off the dirt road about two miles from the unmanned GTE facility and 
plunged into the ravine. 
</P>
<P>
The van went off the road at the 4,000-foot elevation, and officials reported 
that it was likely that that elevation was shrouded in fog late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol is investigating why the van went off the road. 
Fish's body and the van could not be removed Thursday because weather 
conditions made it unsafe, CHP Officer Dave Padgett said. The removal is 
expected to take place today, weather permitting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2,000-Foot Plunge 
</P>
<P>
"It is more than 2,000 feet down off the road," Padgett said. "It was too wet 
and miserable to attempt to bring the victim out. We will try again." 
</P>
<P>
GTE is also conducting an investigation of the accident, spokesman Larry Cox 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Fish, a 19-year employee who had a wife and two sons, had been 
dispatched from GTE's work yard in San Fernando to the Mt. Lukens facility to 
repair microwave circuits. 
</P>
<P>
Although employees routinely call after completing an assignment, it was 
unclear whether Fish called in Wednesday, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
Cox did not know if workers routinely ask for or are provided weather reports 
before going to facilities at high altitudes, but he said GTE employees are 
instructed "to never do anything that is going to jeopardize their safety."

EL SEGUNDO TO VOTE ON 2 TAX HIKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two ballot measures aimed at bailing El Segundo out of its fiscal crisis by 
increasing taxes for all property and business owners will go before the city's 
voters Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The city is broke, basically," Mayor Carl Jacobson said in an interview this 
week. "It's either we get new tax revenues or we cut services drastically." 
</P>
<P>
The first, Measure E, would affect only business owners. It would double the 
utility-user tax to 4% and raise an estimated $3.5 million a year in new 
revenues, city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The other, Measure F, would impose an excise tax on property and cost each 
homeowner about $60 a year. Businesses would also pay the tax under a formula 
based on the size of the buildings they occupy. The measure would bring in more 
than $2.5 million a year, according to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
Both measures require a simple majority to pass. 
</P>
<P>
Council members voted last November to hold a spring election specifically to 
deal with the city's financial troubles. For the past six years, the city has 
been forced to draw from a dwindling reserve fund to balance its budget, which 
this year is about $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the controversy over the election has centered on Southern California 
Edison Co.'s efforts to pass on the cost of the tax it would pay under Measure 
E to El Segundo residents by adding a surcharge to their electric bills. 
</P>
<P>
The El Segundo Chamber of Commerce, which has a political action committee and 
has taken stands in previous city elections, has not taken a public position on 
either measure, a chamber official said. Nevertheless, some if its members 
would see their tax bills increase significantly if both measures pass. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, under Measure F, Rockwell International would be taxed $45,672 a 
year on its 346,000-square-foot building on Douglas Street. Hughes Aircraft 
would pay $131,769 a year on its 2-million-square-foot building on El Segundo 
Boulevard. No figures were available for the impact of Measure E on these two 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Lose Exemption 
</P>
<P>
Edison has campaigned against Measure E because it would lose its longtime 
exemption from the local utility-user tax. Darcy Skaggs, Edison's area manager, 
said municipalities usually grant such an exemption to utility companies. 
</P>
<P>
"If this measure passes, this will be the first time in the state that a 
utility company would not be exempt from a user's tax," Skaggs said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Kenneth Chew, a financial analyst with the state Public Utilities 
Commission in San Francisco, said it is "very common" for companies such as 
Edison to be subjected to utility-user taxes. Usually, the PUC grants the 
utility permission to raise rates to recover the cost of the tax, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all part of the operating costs," Chew said. 
</P>
<P>
Skaggs said Edison has already applied to the PUC for permission to levy the 
surcharge, which would cost the average El Segundo homeowner $10 to $15 a year. 
</P>
<P>
If Measure E passes and Edison fails in its bid before the PUC, the utility 
will try to pass the added cost on to all its customers, Skaggs said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Be Restored 
</P>
<P>
Edison's action has prompted Mayor Jacobson and Councilman Jim Clutter to say 
they will make sure that residents are not stuck with higher electric bills. If 
the utility prevails before the commission, they said, they will restore 
Edison's exemption. 
</P>
<P>
Because Measure E's intent is not to impose an extra fee or tax on residents, 
the council is within its legal right to take such corrective action, Jacobson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo officials trace the city's money problems back to 1982, when the 
local Chevron refinery lost a major fuel oil contract as Edison switched to 
natural gas, and millions of dollars in sales tax revenues stopped flowing to 
the city. For example, El Segundo earned nearly $13 million in sales taxes in 
1980, at least $10 million of which came from Chevron, city figures show. 
</P>
<P>
Sales tax revenues plummeted to about $2.3 million in 1982 after Chevron lost 
the contract and are expected to total about $3.5 million for the 1988-89 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The city has about $3 million in reserves, enough to cover an expected general 
operating budget deficit of $1.6 million in fiscal 1989-90, officials said. But 
if capital improvement projects planned for the same year are included, they 
said, the deficit jumps to $8.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Philosophical Differences 
</P>
<P>
Council members have conceded that efforts to solve the city's financial 
troubles have been stymied by their own philosophical differences. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Alan West and Bob Anderson have generally taken the unpopular stance 
that residents should be asked to pay higher fees or taxes, while Jacobson, 
Clutter and Councilman Scot Dannen have insisted that businesses should be 
required to contribute more to the city's treasury. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the decision to put two measures on the ballot was reached only after 
weeks of haggling among council members. In the end, the council decided to 
compromise and put measures on the ballot that affect the pocketbooks of both 
residents and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Of the five council members, only Anderson supports both measures. West, who 
also favored both at first, now opposes them. Jacobson and Clutter support 
Measure E, the utility-user tax measure, but refuse to take a stand on Measure 
F, the excise tax on property. Dannen supports Measure E but opposes Measure F. 
</P>
<P>
West, in an interview, said he flip-flopped and finally chose to oppose the 
measures because the council has not determined exactly how much new revenue is 
needed and for what purposes. Asking voters to approve either measure is like 
asking them to sign a blank check, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"My sincere hope," West said, "is that this council will stop the personal 
bickering and hatchet jobs towards each other and realistically look at our 
needs."

SECOND TO WRIGHT IN TOTAL AMOUNTS FROM GIFTS, FEES; 
</P>
<P>
KATZ REPORTS $8,950 FROM SPEAKING ENGAGEMENTS IN 1988 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) received $8,950 in speaking fees in 1988 -- 
more than the combined totals of eight other San Fernando Valley-area 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
Katz reported in his 1988 financial disclosure statement that he donated $2,200 
in honorariums from three speeches to charities but, reversing his past 
practices, retained the remaining $6,750 from five lectures. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to give some of them away if I can," Katz said Thursday of the lecture 
fees. "Sometimes, frankly, they help my personal cash flow at the time we 
receive them. We'll still continue to give as many away as we can." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, he had steered his entire $2,100 from six speeches to nonprofit 
groups. "There's a cloud over honorariums that is subject to 
misinterpretation," he said last year. 
</P>
<P>
Katz's economic interest report was one of four filed with the state Fair 
Political Practices Commission by Valley-area lawmakers that became available 
Thursday. Each was postmarked before Wednesday's midnight deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) reported that he accepted $500 
each for speeches to the Assn. of California Life Insurance Companies and the 
California Automatic Vendors Assn., as well as gifts totaling $787. State Sen. 
Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) received $1,408 in gifts, and Assemblyman Terry B. 
Friedman (D-Los Angeles), $1,708. Both said they took no honorariums. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the nine Valley-area legislators accepted a relatively modest $23,706 
in gifts and travel expenses and $16,036 in fees for speeches and conference 
panels, primarily from special interests pushing bills in the Legislature, 
according to the reports. The five other lawmakers' filings were the focus of a 
story in Thursday's Times. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) received the greatest amount, with 
a total of $15,241 in gifts and speaking fees. Katz, who took $4,690 in gifts 
in addition to his honorariums, was second with $13,640. The other seven 
received lesser amounts. Four lawmakers reported that they accepted no 
honorariums -- a commonplace but often-criticized practice. A fifth lawmaker 
said he gave all his speaking fees to charities. 
</P>
<P>
Valley lawmakers fell far short of the tallies of Assembly Speaker Willie Brown 
(D-San Francisco), who reported collecting more than $100,000 in speaking fees, 
gifts and travel expenses. He is the undisputed leader in these realms. 
</P>
<P>
There were no limits last year on such monies; a $1,000-a-year limitation on 
gifts and speaking fees from any source went into effect in January under 
Proposition 73, passed in June, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Katz's speaking fees included $2,500 from Tutor-Saliba Corp., a large Sylmar 
construction firm that is widening the Ventura Freeway; $2,000 from the San 
Francisco law firm of Stone &amp; Younger; $1,500 from Carl Terzian Associates, 
a Los Angeles public relations company, and $1,000 from the California Council 
for Environmental and Economic Balance. 
</P>
<P>
Katz, chairman of the Assembly Transportation Committee, said most of his 
speeches focused on the state's transportation crisis. This included the 
Tutor-Saliba address before more than 100 community leaders at a Los Angeles 
luncheon in September. 
</P>
<P>
"The honorariums I take are for speeches that are given, and I can justify that 
and show what went into them and the benefit," Katz said, apparently 
contrasting his practices with those of legislators who take fees for attending 
seminars or conferences. 
</P>
<P>
Katz added that he would support a ban on honorariums as well as other outside 
income if legislators' salaries were significantly raised, a position advocated 
by Brown. Lawmakers are paid $40,816 a year as well as a daily allowance of $88 
for legislative business. 
</P>
<P>
Katz also reported that he earned from $1,001 to $10,000 from printing, layout 
and design work for both RK Graphics, his Sepulveda business, and Tee Graphics 
in Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran lawmaker gave $1,700 from two speeches to Johnnie Carpenter's 
Heaven on Earth Ranch in Lake View Terrace and $500 from another to the 
Planning and Conservation League. John Carpenter is a retired Hollywood stunt 
man who uses his stables and Western sets to do shows for developmentally 
disabled children from the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an opportunity for the kids who never get to see a Hollywood stunt man or 
a cowboy up close," Katz said. "It's fantastic for them."

WEEKENDER: GO FLY A KITE IS AN INVITATION, NOT AN INSULT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Redondo Pier Assn. hopes a few hundred people will want to go fly a kite 
Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
That's the opening day of the three-weekend Festival of the Kite. It will 
celebrate kite flying as the festival has done for 14 years, while raising some 
money to help restore the pier, partially destroyed by storms and fire last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to public kite flying at the pier from noon to 5 p.m. each Sunday, 
the free festival will offer a precision stunt-kiting show, Japanese drum 
dancers, a kite-flying Garfield the cat, and aerial kite combat. This event 
will raise money for the pier through contributions by South Bay-based 
businesses sponsoring the fighting kites. 
</P>
<P>
The star attraction on Sunday from 1 to 4 p.m. will be the Top Of the Line 
acrobatic kite team from San Diego. The four-member team flies delta-shaped 
nylon kites with eight-foot wingspans. Each of the big kites are controlled 
with two lines, enabling the kites to fly in formation, move in opposing 
directions, loop around each other, all 150 feet above the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing what they do," said Randy Joe, owner of the kite shop on the 
pier. He has been staging the festival for 14 years. "It's like the Blue Angels 
with kites." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the maneuvers of the famed U.S. Navy precision fliers were the model 
for the team, said manager Michael Dvorak. "It's stunt flying, but with kites," 
he said. Team leader Don Taber also does kite ballet to classical music, flying 
three to five kites at a time. 
</P>
<P>
Before and after the entertainment, the main attraction will be an abundance of 
kites. 
</P>
<P>
"We get people who are kite nuts," said Joe. "Our philosophy is to get the 
entire family to come out and enjoy the day. When you see a lot of kites in the 
air, it's really colorful." 
</P>
<P>
He said if the weather is good, 700 to 800 kites should be aloft on Sunday on 
the beach south of the pier, with hundreds of people watching and taking 
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Those who don't bring kites may purchase them for as little as $3.50. Kite 
experts will be on hand to help assemble the kites and to offer flying tips. 
</P>
<P>
On the second Sunday of the festival, March 12, 100 kites donated by a kite 
company will be given to senior citizens, who will fly them on the beach. "A 
lot of them wouldn't normally take part in something like this," Joe said. 
</P>
<P>
A walking, talking Garfield the cat will also put in an appearance and fly a 
kite, and the Kinnara Taiko Group, Japanese percussionists, will dance and do 
precision drumming at 2:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
To sponsor a kite in aerial combat, companies donate $750 to the Redondo Pier 
Reconstruction Fund. The businesses get their logos on a kite and something to 
cheer for during the event, March 19 from 1 to 4 p.m.. 
</P>
<P>
Joe said the six-foot-tall, six-sided fighting kites are maneuvered by pulling 
and releasing control lines. "It's like a tug of war," he said. "When the lines 
cross, bringing the rope in can create a friction to cut string. The idea is to 
bring down the other kite." 
</P>
<P>
On all three Sundays, a parasailer will cruise by the festival, suspended above 
the water on a parachute and pulled by a boat. 
</P>
<P>
Festival-goers, too, will be able to parasail if they win one of the periodic 
free drawings for the five-minute rides. 
</P>
<P>
Today's kites -- no longer simple string and paper affairs -- are all shapes, 
sizes, colors and designs. They are triangular or diamond shaped; they look 
like sharks, birds and even Mickey Mouse. Joe himself will be flying a 
three-dimensional life-sized flying crane that looks like a real bird. 
</P>
<P>
Said Joe: "The beach lends itself to kite flying because there's always a wind. 
Kites are so well-made today, anyone can fly them and get a sense of 
accomplishment." Gerald Faris

EMPTY SCHOOL BUS CRASHES INTO HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A school bus with no students on board careened out of control on a 
rain-slicked street Thursday morning and crashed into the front door of a home 
in Reseda, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The bus driver, Cynthia Hankins, 24, of Los Angeles, was slightly injured in 
the 8:15 a.m. accident in the 18600 block of Victory Boulevard, authorities 
said. A startled resident wrenched her knee when the bus crashed into her home. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sitting on the couch by the window, and I saw this bus make a 90-degree 
swing and start coming toward our house," Linda Ballard said. "I kept thinking 
it was going to stop. But not even the house stopped it. I jumped up at the 
last second, and I guess I wrenched my knee." 
</P>
<P>
The bus crashed through the front porch, shattered front windows and knocked 
down the door of the house. Ballard's mother, Ruby Cartwright, was in a rear 
bedroom when she heard the crash. 
</P>
<P>
"I was asleep, and I thought it was an earthquake," she said. "I came out and 
saw a school bus had kind of slid right in my front door." 
</P>
<P>
Hankins was taken to Northridge Hospital Medical Center where she was listed in 
stable condition. The extent of her injuries were not immediately released. 
Ballard was not hospitalized after the accident.

STUDY OF RENEWAL NEEDS OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council voted Tuesday to spend $100,000 to conduct a study 
of renewal needs in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
The study, proposed by harbor-area Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, will look 
into economic conditions, population trends and other factors that affect 
industrial, commercial and residential development in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
"It will . . . determine future development opportunities, providing the city 
with valuable planning information, possibly leading to expanding 
revitalization efforts in Wilmington," Flores said in a press release. 
</P>
<P>
The study, to be conducted by the Community Redevelopment Agency and the 
Community Development Department, will focus on potential commercial growth on 
portions of Avalon Boulevard and Anaheim Street. It also will look into 
potential industrial development on the north side of Anaheim between Lakme 
Avenue and Alameda Street.

NEWHALL PROJECT GETS 2ND PLANNING OK; 
</P>
<P>
PROTESTERS ARRIVE 2 YEARS TOO LATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

When a handful of Newhall residents learned that a 510-unit apartment complex 
was planned near their neighborhood, they collected more than 100 signatures of 
protest and marched down to the Los Angeles County Regional Planning Commission 
this week to state their case. 
</P>
<P>
The residents discovered, however, that the battle was already over. In fact, 
it ended two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The issue before planning commissioners Wednesday was not whether to let a 
developer build the 510 apartments. The plans were approved in May, 1987. The 
issue was whether to approve a conditional-use permit to change the project's 
design, but not its size. 
</P>
<P>
"What really bothers me is that none of us knew that," homeowner Eric J. Parde 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a total surprise," said Victoria Maw, one of Parde's neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners, saying it was too late to make major changes in the development, 
approved a conditional-use permit for the project by Saunders Development Co. 
of Santa Monica. It will include a 267-room hotel, offices and a shopping 
center near Pico Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
Residents did not accuse the county or Saunders of keeping the development a 
secret. They even praised the design approved Wednesday, saying it provided 
more open space. 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners said afterward they were victims of poor timing. The project had 
been approved just before many of the residents moved to the area. When they 
received public notices about the project recently, they assumed it was 
starting from scratch, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the project faced no opposition. "I was really dismayed when I 
found out that nobody had fought it before," Parde said.

UCLA'S BIG MEN DO THE JOB; 
</P>
<P>
BRUINS GAIN 19TH VICTORY BY BEATING CALIFORNIA, 81-73

While the sellout crowd of 6,578 in Harmon Arena taunted UCLA forward Trevor 
Wilson with its familiar sing-song chant of "Tre-vor, Tre-vor, Tre-vor," a 
couple of other big Bruins, namely Kevin Walker and Don MacLean, set about the 
business of helping Wilson shut them up. 
</P>
<P>
MacLean scored 27 points and had nine rebounds. Walker scored 21 points, made 
five of six shots from three-point range and held California star Leonard 
Taylor to 22 before Taylor fouled out. Wilson had 17 points and 12 rebounds 
while, at times, being called upon to play guard. 
</P>
<P>
It all added to an 81-73 victory for UCLA Thursday night, a victory that gave 
UCLA a 19-7 record going into its final regular-season game against Arizona 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins would love to reach the 20-victory plateau. But they were thrilled 
with No. 19 because that probably means they will gain a berth in the National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to think that we have taken the decision out of the committee's 
hands now," UCLA Coach Jim Harrick said. "I hope it's a lock." 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins had a lock on the game with five minutes left when Wilson scored 
inside to give the Bruins a 72-58 lead. But there were a lot of fouls called 
over the final minutes as the Golden Bears kept scrapping, and the Bruins 
missed the front end of a string of free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, as Wilson pointed out, "They made a couple of runs at us, but we always 
seemed to come up with a big play when we needed it." 
</P>
<P>
Once again, Walker got the Bruins off to a great start with his three-point 
shooting -- four for four in the first half. That forced Cal out of its zone. 
</P>
<P>
"After Walker shot 'em out of the zone, and we made them play us man-to-man, 
we're almost impossible to defense man-to-man at the forward spots," Harrick 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Walker just played a tremendous game for us. He played the total, consummate 
team game, He sacrificed himself to play defense on Leonard, and he's a great 
player. We did as good a job as we could playing him. And Walker still managed 
to get his points." 
</P>
<P>
Also, when guard Darrick Martin started to struggle and Harrick found his bench 
a little short on guards with the absence of the injured Kevin Williams, Wilson 
did a good job of switching positions. 
</P>
<P>
"Putting Wilson at guard confused them a little," Harrick said. "I think that 
caused them some matchup problems. They didn't have anyone to stop him." 
</P>
<P>
Sending backup forward Charles Rochelin in for Martin put Pooh Richardson at 
guard alongside Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
"They tried to box and chase Walker," Harrick said. "But then Trevor hits or 
MacLean hits. And Walker was willing to pass the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Walker had four assists. 
</P>
<P>
Cal never led, but the Golden Bears did manage to pull into a tie early and cut 
the Bruins' lead from six points to one point midway through the first half. In 
the second half, the Golden Bears made a couple of runs to get within striking 
distance before UCLA scored seven straight points to take a 60-50 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Don MacLean played the entire game and did not seem to be bothered by 
the sprained arch in the top of his left foot. His 27 points were a conference 
high for him. The only game in which he scored more (41) was against North 
Texas. . . . UCLA has won nine of 11 . . . Pooh Richardson went zero for three 
from the free-throw line, all misses on the front end of one-and-ones. Darrick 
Martin was zero for six from the field. . . . Cal, 18-11 overall and 9-8 in the 
conference, has one game left, against USC Saturday, but will finish in fifth 
place in the Pac-10 season standings.

MORNING BRIEFING: HE GETS BACK INTO THE SWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dar-ryl ... Dar-ryl . . . Dar-ryl. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Mets' talented and turbulent right fielder, Darryl Strawberry, is 
already in postseason form. Strawberry, the National League's top home run 
hitter last season, walked out of the Mets' camp Thursday in Port St. Lucie, 
Fla., because of a contract dispute after taking a swing at teammate Keith 
Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble began as Strawberry sat between catcher Gary Carter and Manager 
Davey Johnson for the team picture on camera day at the park. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Strawberry exchanged words with Hernandez, sitting on the other side 
of Johnson. The two jumped up and pointed fingers and Strawberry swung at 
Hernandez before they were restrained by teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Add Strawberry: His problems center on the demands of him and his new agent, 
Eric Goldschmidt, to renegotiate and extend a five-year contract signed in 1985 
that pays the right fielder $1.4 million this year, with an option for $1.8 
million in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
More Strawberry: Johnson said he was kind of surprised that Strawberry and 
Hernandez got into a fight because they usually get along and he was kind of 
sorry it happened with so many media types around. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, it happened on camera day so you got some good shots," Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Last add Strawberry: He said that the problem is less the money than his status 
and pride as the team's leading hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Uh, huh. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Five other Mets make more money than Strawberry. Who are they? 
</P>
<P>
This was the 55th spring training for Birdie Tebbetts, a Baltimore Orioles 
scout. 
</P>
<P>
"One difference between when I came up and now is that I look out here and I 
don't see any fat guys . . . but I haven't seen (Bob) Horner yet," Tebbetts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Horner, by the way, is not only expected to make the team, he may get as many 
as 500 at-bats and hit anywhere from fourth to sixth. 
</P>
<P>
But back to Birdie's fat story: "Years ago, if a player came to camp 
overweight, they would have a big stove in the back of the clubhouse. They 
would get it real hot. The player would put on all his clothes, then put 
blankets on himself, go in there and sweat it off." 
</P>
<P>
Bad Barry update: In a Tulsa newspaper telephone poll, 76% said that Oklahoma 
football Coach Barry Switzer should not resign. And 77% said the same thing in 
another poll by a Tulsa television station. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Hernandez, Gary Carter, Dwight Gooden, Ron Darling and Kevin 
McReynolds. 
</P>
<P>
How hard is Sugar Ray Leonard training for his rematch against Thomas Hearns? 
According to Wallace Matthews of Newsday, so far not very hard, but then the 
fight is more than three months away. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard did some leg training after the Tyson-Bruno fight: He danced at a disco 
until about midnight at a Las Vegas nightclub and had sipped a pink concoction 
through a straw between rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook 
</P>
<P>
From Larry Holmes on Mike Tyson's decision to drop manager Bill Cayton and join 
forces with promoter Don King, Holmes' former nemesis: "You don't get off the 
horse that brought you over the bridge to get on another horse. Especially not 
that horse. I know that horse too well."

VINTAGE GOLF TOURNAMENT; 
</P>
<P>
CHARLES HAS 68 IN WIND AND LEADS BY 2 SHOTS

<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Charles grew up in New Zealand and learned to play golf under windy 
conditions. But he doesn't like the wind. In fact, one of the reasons he plays 
so much golf in this country is to avoid it. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, some of the left-hander's best golf has been played under difficult 
conditions. He won the first senior tournament, at Wood Ranch in Simi Valley 
where the 50-and-over group doesn't play anymore, mainly because high winds are 
a way of life on the course. He also won here two years ago when the wind blew, 
although not as hard as it did Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
There were steady winds of 20 m.p.h., with gusts to 40 for the first round of 
the Vintage Chrysler Invitational tournament at the Vintage Club. 
</P>
<P>
And you guessed it. The leader is Charles, who shot a 68, four under par, for a 
two-stroke lead in the 72-hole event in which the winner picks up $55,500. 
Miller Barber, the leading money winner this young season, was second at 70. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Player, although he had to go to a doctor immediately after his round 
because the wind caused problems with a contact lens, led a group of five at 
71. Tom Shaw and Lou Graham, J.C. Goosie, former champion Dale Douglass and Don 
January were also one under. January, once the top player on the senior tour, 
is not often a factor anymore because his schedule only allows him to play 12 
tournaments a year 
</P>
<P>
Orville Moody, who won the Vintage by 11 shots a year ago, and Larry Mowry were 
at par 72. But for the most part, scores were high on a course in perfect 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
"Under the circumstances, that was a good round," Charles said. "I know I play 
well in the wind, but I don't enjoy it. I was fortunate to have pretty good 
control of my shots and was around the green all day. I made a 25-foot putt for 
an eagle on the 15th and an eight-foot putt to save a par. Otherwise, all my 
putts were short, even the 2 1/2-footer I missed for a bogey on the 13th." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the birdies were on downwind holes, although Harold Henning, who soared 
to a 77 after consecutive second-place finishes, had trouble finding downwind 
holes. As he teed off on a hole halfway through his round he asked, "Why is it 
we seem to be hitting into the wind on every hole?" 
</P>
<P>
Most of the golfers figured it to be a two- or three-club wind, but Barber said 
it was swirling and changing directions 
</P>
<P>
"For instance, on the 15th (515 yards), it usually takes a driver, three-wood 
and a sand wedge to reach (the green)," he said. "But today, I hit a driver and 
was amazed when the next shot called for a five-iron. Under normal conditions, 
I can't reach in two." 
</P>
<P>
There were other unusual shots and rounds. Mowry, who won the Suncoast 
tournament at Tampa, Fla., two weeks ago, started on the back nine. In his 
first six holes, he needed only five putts. Three saved pars and two were for 
birdies. He went to three under when he sank a 25-footer from the fringe. 
</P>
<P>
On the 435-yard 14th, he hit a career drive, although it appeared he was 
hitting into a crosswind. Al Geiberger, in the foursome ahead of him, heard the 
ball hit behind him, turned and shook his head in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
Mowry's caddie figured the ball stopped 95 yards from the hole, making it a 
340-yard drive. This from a man who was doing exercises between shots to try to 
loosen a stiff back. 
</P>
<P>
"My putting saved me from disaster," he said. "The ball just wouldn't go where 
I was aiming it. Maybe the back had something to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
He shot a strange par round. He needed only 23 putts, but he made only six 
greens in regulation and had three birdies and three bogeys. 
</P>
<P>
"I missed a sub-par round because I failed to sink a 15-foot putt for a par on 
the last hole," he said. "I didn't miss many during the day." 
</P>
<P>
Hardly anyone had a worse time with the wind than Geiberger. One of the 
favorites, he started on the back nine and shot a 38. On the front side, he had 
a pair of sevens en route to an 80, eight over. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the biggest surprise among the leaders is Goosie. He runs the Space 
Coast mini-tour for pros in Florida and doesn't have time to play many 
tournaments. He will be 60 in May. He was mostly retired from 1961 to 1986.

Tom Byrum, the first man off the tee, made nine birdies for a seven-under-par 
65 that gave him the lead Thursday in the storm-disrupted first round of the 
$800,000 Honda tournament. 
</P>
<P>
None of the afternoon starters -- including defending champion Joey Sindelar, 
Paul Azinger, Mark O'Meara and Bruce Lietzke -- had completed 18 holes when the 
first of a series of thunderstorms swept over the TPC course at Eagle Trace. 
</P>
<P>
The 72 players stranded by the storms marked their positions and are scheduled 
to return this morning to complete first-round play. 
</P>
<P>
PGA Tour Tournament Director Tom Shea said second-round play will begin at 10 
a.m., EST, with a last starting time of about 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no chance of finishing second-round play tomorrow," he said. "But 
we'll finish the second round on Saturday, make the cut, then play the third 
round Saturday afternoon and be back on schedule -- weather permitting," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The high humidity and morning fog, which delayed the start of the day's play 
for 45 minutes, combined with the rare absence of wind to produce exceptionally 
good scoring conditions for the early starters. 
</P>
<P>
Three of them, South African Fulton Allem, Fred Couples and Ted Schulz, are 
tied at 66.

BIG WEST ROUNDUP;

<P>
IRVINE LOSES TO UTAH STATE IN OVERTIME

<P>
UC Irvine blew a 14-point second-half lead and lost in overtime, 95-94, to Utah 
State Thursday night in front of 3,361 in the Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters, 11-5 overall and 8-9 in Big West play, will probably have to 
play in the qualifying round of the Big West tournament next Wednesday at the 
Long Beach Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters are currently tied for seventh place with Fresno State. However, 
they still could end up in a three-way tie for sixth with Fresno and Cal State 
Fullerton. In that case, they would avoid playing a qualifying-round game 
because they would be seeded No. 6 due to tiebreaker rules. 
</P>
<P>
Utah State (12-14, 10-7) outscored Irvine, 14-0, in a span of less than three 
minutes late in the second half after trailing, 74-60, with 7:07 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Irvine had a chance to win the game in regulation when Ricky Butler, who 
scored 22 to lead Irvine, missed a 10-foot baseline jumper with two seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine trailed by as many as six, 92-86, in the overtime when the Aggies had 
their biggest lead of the game, but Justin Anderson's three-pointer with six 
seconds left pulled the Anteaters to within one, 95-94. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine quickly fouled guard Reid Newey, the conference's best free-throw 
shooter at 81%, but the senior guard missed the front end of the one-and-one 
and Irvine freshman Elgin Rogers grabbed the rebound, dribbled to midcourt and 
flung the ball out of bounds on what was either a poor shot or an errant pass. 
</P>
<P>
Newey, who had 26 points in Utah State's 104-71 victory earlier this season, 
picked up his fourth foul with 16:24 left but managed to keep from fouling out. 
</P>
<P>
Three Anteaters weren't as fortunate. Senior Mike Doktorczyk, Irvine's leading 
scorer, andguard Kevin Floyd and Butler fouled out. 
</P>
<P>
With Rod Palmer ill, Irvine's Mike Labat got his first start since the team's 
Big West opener at UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Labat scored eight first-half points and did a good job of defending Newey, who 
had only 15 points. JOHN WEYLER

CS FULLERTON'S LATE MAGIC DISAPPEARS IN A 60-56 LOSS

<P>
With this same script, Cal State Fullerton had won other games this season. 
</P>
<P>
They had won by coming from 13 points behind. They had won after John Sykes 
picked up a loose-ball and stuffed it in the late going. They had won when 
Wayne Williams made a long-range three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
But this time, the comeback failed, Sykes' shot rimmed out, and Williams' 
three-pointer bounded off the heel of the basket just before the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
Not that even the three-pointer would have been enough. Fullerton got the ball 
back for the final time trailing by four with four seconds left. It ended that 
way, with New Mexico State taking a 60-56 victory Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
With that, New Mexico State clinched second place in the Big West Conference, 
winning its 19th game of the season. The Aggies 12-5 in the Big West, 19-8 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans (14-12, 9-8) can clinch at least sixth place with a victory over Cal 
State Long Beach Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Like several other Big West teams, the Titans are trying to finish sixth or 
better to earn a first-round bye in the conference tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies, who nearly let this one get away with poor free-throw shooting (16 
of 30), ultimately won it at the line. 
</P>
<P>
William Benjamin, a freshman who is averaging just five points a game, hit both 
ends of a one-and-one with four seconds left to put the Aggies ahead by four. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton trailed by five at halftime, then fell behind, 44-31, when Jeff 
McCool hit a three-pointer with 13 minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
But Fullerton cut the margin on back-to-back inside baskets by David Moody. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans, only one for 12 from three-point range, hit their one when Mark 
Hill connected to cut the lead to 52-49 with 4:20 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton, fouling New Mexico State inside, watched as the Aggies missed free 
throws -- 10 of 19 in the second half. But the closest Fullerton got was 57-56 
with 1:27 left. 
</P>
<P>
Sykes blocked a shot, and Cedric Ceballos came up with the ball and broke 
downcourt, but his on-the-move shot in the lane didn't fall. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton had one more solid chance, trailing, 58-56, with 33 seconds left. 
Mark Hill tried a three-pointer with about 12 seconds left. Sykes picked up the 
loose-ball rebound, but also missed. Van Anderson tried once more for the 
Titans, but his shot also went in and came out.

RUSH LEADS VALLEY PAST SAN MATEO INTO STATE JC SEMIFINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH NICHOLS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tisa Rush landed on her backside but came up smiling. The Valley College 
freshman guard was so happy about sinking a layup that she felt little pain 
from the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been bricking on my layups tonight, so I was relieved just to get one 
in," Rush said. 
</P>
<P>
Rush scored a game-high 21 points to lead the Valley women's basketball team to 
an 84-68 victory over College of San Mateo in a California junior college 
championship quarterfinal game at Valley on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Monarchs (30-3) will play Fullerton College (27-1), a 87-70 winner 
over Contra Costa, in the semifinals at 8 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
College of the Sequoias (34-3) will play American River College (27-4) at 6 
tonight in the other semifinal game. Sequoias defeated Golden West, 80-61, and 
American River was a 77-62 winner over Los Angeles Trade Tech in earlier games. 
</P>
<P>
By virtue of the play of Rush and Christine Rumfola, who added 16 points, 
Valley had a relatively easy time dispatching San Mateo. The Lady Monarchs led, 
42-33, at halftime and did not allow the Bulldogs (29-2) within 10 points in 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Yet despite the Lady Monarchs' lead, Valley Coach Doug Michelson remained wary 
of the Bulldogs, who had won 21 consecutive games before Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been around basketball long enough to know that a 10-point lead in the 
second half is not enough," Michelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Rush broke open a close game with a three-point shot as time ran out in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a huge momentum play for us," Michelson said. "She had a great 
offensive game, but she also did a great job defensively on a big-time point 
guard, (Eleanor) Wells." 
</P>
<P>
San Mateo led for the first seven minutes until Valley pulled even, 11-11, on 
Rush's first three-point basket. Rush added a basket 28 seconds later to put 
Valley ahead to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Rush, who averages 11.5 points and 3.8 assists a game, was three for three from 
three-point range and made nine of 14 field-goal tries. 
</P>
<P>
Shagarro Lattin added 14 points for Valley and Sandrine Rocher scored 12 points 
off the bench. Center Ruth Aguilar, who averages a team-high 14.7 points a 
game, sat out part of the second half because of foul trouble and added only 
seven points. 
</P>
<P>
Lattin filled in for Aguilar on the boards with six rebounds to lead Valley, 
which has won 14 games in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia Hedgebeth scored 21 points for San Mateo and center Pauline Manu added 
15.

NORTHRIDGE WOMEN TOP CHAPMAN IN TOURNAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bridgette Ealy finds it difficult to clearly define her role on the Cal State 
Northridge women's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
"I do what I have to do," the sophomore guard says. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night against Chapman, Ealy did plenty. 
</P>
<P>
She brought the ball upcourt, drove the lane and posted defenders down low en 
route to posting big numbers for the Lady Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
Ealy scored 20 of her game-high 23 points in the first half as Northridge 
rolled to an 89-73 win in the opening round of the four-team California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. tournament at Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
The victory improved Northridge's record to 21-7 -- establishing a school 
record for most wins in a season -- and avenged two defeats to Chapman during 
the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, ranked 14th in Division II, will attempt to win its first 
conference title on Saturday at 6 p.m. when the Lady Matadors play third-ranked 
Pomona, a 73-72 winner Thursday over Cal State Los Angeles, in the tournament 
final at Riverside City College. 
</P>
<P>
"We're feeling good about the way we're playing, our confidence is real high 
and we're executing," Northridge guard Vicki Mallett said. "We're doing the 
things we need to win ballgames. So if we can just stay with that we should be 
OK." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge concluded the regular season last week with wins over Pomona and UC 
Riverside. And Thursday night the Lady Matadors again demonstrated that they 
are peaking at the right time. 
</P>
<P>
"I think losing to them (Chapman) two times in conference really bothered us," 
said Northridge Coach Leslie Milke, the CCAA coach of the year. "I think deep 
down we felt we were the better team but we didn't show it." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge players complemented Ealy's first-half performance. They made 12 of 
13 free throws to help offset Chapman's 65% shooting from the field that 
enabled the Panthers to take a 39-38 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman increased its lead to 43-38 less than a minute into the second half 
before Ealy orchestrated a 17-0, six-minute run that put Northridge ahead, 
55-43. 
</P>
<P>
"During the first half, they got impatient and took some bad shots," Milke said 
of her players. "In the second half they became patient and executed what we 
needed to do. That was the difference." 
</P>
<P>
Said Ealy, who had 11 rebounds and four assists: "I think they thought I was 
going to come out and shoot the ball and play like I did the first half. But I 
just did what I have to do. Everyone on this team can score." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, forward Julie Arlotto (19 points, six rebounds), center Chris Cavalin 
(15 points, 11 rebounds), forward Paula Lucas (19 points, seven rebounds) and 
Mallett (13 points) keyed the second-half surge. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman pulled to within 60-53 with a little more than 10 minutes left, but 
that was as close as the Panthers could get. 
</P>
<P>
"In the second half, we had too many turnovers, we didn't block out or play 
good post defense," said Chapman Coach Paul Kahn, whose team committed 26 
turnovers and finished the season 13-13. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge will face a Pomona team that lost to the Lady Matadors, 67-61, last 
Thursday. The Northridge victory snapped Pomona's 26-game win streak in the 
CCAA and also ended Northridge's own 29-game losing streak against the Lady 
Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge lost to Pomona in the CCAA tournament and West region final in 
1985-86 and also lost to the Lady Broncos in the conference tournament final in 
1986-87. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge players are eager to prove that last week's victory was no fluke. 
"If we play like we did against them last week, we'll beat them," Ealy said.

TOROS' SHARPSHOOTER BLACKMON HAS SHOT AT ALL-AMERICAN HONORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anthony Blackmon has received his share of attention this season. 
</P>
<P>
The senior center at Cal State Dominguez Hills was the subject of a half-time 
radio talk show in a game at Sonoma State, front-page in the sports pages of 
the Bakersfield Californian and the reason for a mailer sent out this week to 
Division II coaches by Dominguez Hills officials touting him as "a candidate 
for All-American recognition." 
</P>
<P>
He has been scouted by at least three professional basketball teams because he 
has led the 19-8 Toros in scoring and rebounding 17 times this season. 
</P>
<P>
At this point in his career, could candidate be an unnecessary word for the 
6-foot-7 post who leads the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. in scoring and 
rebounding? He's been named to the first team All-Western Region team for the 
second consecutive year, and because he has been voted CCAA Player of the Week 
three times this season, he is expected to be a unanimous choice as the 
conference most valuable player when the coaches vote today. 
</P>
<P>
Blackmon's credentials will be on the line tonight at 6 when the Toros open the 
CCAA tournament at Riverside City College against Chapman, and the big senior 
from L.A. Wilson High insists the Toros can shake the mini-doldrums they had in 
losing two of their last three games. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing is to focus on what we have to do to win (the tournament) 
outright," he said. "In a game like this, records don't mean much." 
</P>
<P>
Chapman (16-11), the hottest team in the conference, has won four consecutive 
games, including an upset victory over visiting Bakersfield last week, a 
victory that propelled it into a third-place tie with the Roadrunners and 
gained the right to meet Dominguez Hills. In two previous meetings Dominguez 
Hills had easy times in wins over the much more physical basketball style of 
the Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
But "this is a new season," Blackmon asserted. "Everyone is pumped up and ready 
to go out and win. We can't take Chapman for granted." 
</P>
<P>
The winner plays Saturday night against the winner of the Bakersfield-Riverside 
contest at 8 tonight. Riverside (23-4) is ranked sixth in the nation. Dominguez 
Hills is 19th. 
</P>
<P>
There's no doubt Blackmon and his teammates would have preferred to play 
Bakersfield (20-6) tonight, especially since it was the Roadrunners' 52-50 
upset win Feb. 23 that cost Dominguez Hills a chance to host the postseason 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"No question. We can play with anybody," Blackmon said. "As for Bakersfield, 
we'd love to play them again." 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills had to settle for second place, a game behind Riverside, after 
blowing a 10-point lead in the Feb 23 game. Earlier in the year the Toros beat 
Bakersfield, 68-56. 
</P>
<P>
Losing seemingly safe leads has plagued the Toros this year, which Blackmon 
blames on complacency. 
</P>
<P>
"We come out in the second half with those leads and we play not to lose," he 
said. "As a team we forget how we got those leads. You have to attack the other 
team." 
</P>
<P>
Blackmon said the Toros were "too tentative" in the Bakersfield loss, but there 
have been other incidents. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills led NAIA power Biola University by 14 points in its opener and 
lost in double overtime, 69-67, saw a 15-point spread disappear in a 66-63 
overtime loss to hapless Cal Lutheran, blew a 10-point lead and lost to 
Riverside, 59-58, in their first meeting and coughed up a 14-point margin but 
hung on to win the rematch, 72-67, in overtime. In the second game with 
visiting Bakersfield, the Toros led by 10 points midway through the second half 
but did not score in the final 4:21. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Toros work so hard on defense (they are ranked third in the 
nation), some have suggested that the team has trouble maintaining its 
concentration at both ends of the floor for 40 minutes. That is not true, 
according to Blackmon. 
</P>
<P>
"All season I feel we have been the better-conditioned team," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Blackmon does not appear to dominate games like another Toro standout, William 
Alexander, who was the CCAA Co-MVP in 1987. Alexander was a leaper who could 
jump over people, a power player who wanted the ball in the paint. Blackmon is 
more subtle and so his presence doesn't always stand out. Then you look at the 
box score at the conclusion of the game and it reminds you of what a force he 
has been. In four seasons at the school he has become its second-leading scorer 
behind Alexander and, with 25 rebounds last week, the Toros' top rebounder of 
all time. 
</P>
<P>
Three inches taller than Alexander, Blackmon is most comfortable off the 
dribble, preferring to get a lot of his 19.3 points a game from the top of the 
key. He seems most comfortable under the basket on defense, where many of his 
9.9 rebounds a game come from. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't do too many things that look flashy," he said, "I just try to be 
consistent." 
</P>
<P>
As for his rapidly rising star status, a pair of wins this weekend would 
virtually assure that the candidate will become an All-American.

PREP BASEBALL: NEW SEASON -- NEW FACES; 
</P>
<P>
ST. BERNARD'S MELENDEZ COULD REPLACE SCOTT DAVISON AS BRIGHTEST STAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Welcome to 1989 AD (After Davison). The prep baseball season gets under way 
today, weather permitting, without several familiar faces who inhabited South 
Bay ballparks for the better part of the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
Gone but not forgotten are: 
</P>
<P>
* Scott Davison, the Redondo pitcher-shortstop who led the Sea Hawks to four 
league championships and set three Southern Section records in a remarkable 
prep career. 
</P>
<P>
* Heath Jones, the El Segundo pitcher-first baseman whose stellar play over 
four years was the impetus behind the Eagles' continued success. 
</P>
<P>
* Royce Clayton, the flashy St. Bernard shortstop who culminated a dazzling 
career by being a first-round draft choice of the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
* Redondo Coach Harry Jenkins, who stepped down after guiding the Sea Hawks to 
10 league titles and 13 playoff appearances in 18 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"Without Harry there, it's going to leave some kind of void," said El Segundo 
Coach John Stevenson, one of Jenkins' chief competitors through the years. 
"It's hard for me to point to any really strong teams. I think St. Bernard 
could be strong because they have the one superstar." 
</P>
<P>
If there is an heir apparent to Davison in the area, it could be Dan Melendez 
of St. Bernard. The senior left-hander, who pitches and plays first base, won 
the South Bay triple crown last season by hitting .563 with 14 home runs and 51 
RBIs. On the mound, he was 7-2 with a 1.52 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's great," said Stevenson, who coached Melendez last summer on El 
Segundo's American Legion team. "He's a hitter, an excellent defensive first 
baseman and a very, very capable pitcher. He doesn't throw exceptionally hard, 
but his ball moves and he's got a good curveball." 
</P>
<P>
Melendez figures to make a run at the Southern Section record for career 
homers. With 19, he is within striking range of Simi Valley's Scott Sharts, who 
hit 32 from 1986 to '88. 
</P>
<P>
Finding a No. 1 team to replace Redondo, which was 30-3 and reached the 4-A 
semifinals last year, is considerably more difficult. The leading candidates 
appear to be North Torrance, El Segundo, St. Bernard and San Pedro, but there 
are no teams regarded as highly as the 1988 Davison-led Sea Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
That's just fine with Stevenson, beginning his 30th season at El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sick of him," he said of Davison, tongue in cheek. "Nobody should have 
to play a guy like that for four years." 
</P>
<P>
Following is a rundown of the top 10 teams in the South Bay. Last year's record 
is in parentheses: 
</P>
<P>
1. North Torrance (18-9) -- All the signals point to North enjoying a fine 
season. The Saxons return four starters from last year's Bay League champion 
team and they have a good group of players coming up from the junior varsity 
squad that won the league title. Heading the list of returners are all-league 
outfielder Brian Dessert, who will also play first base and pitch; catcher Tony 
Pruett, an all-league outfielder last season as a sophomore; left-handed 
pitcher Leo Cheatham, who posted a 5-2 record in 1988, and shortstop John Clem, 
who moves over from third base. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Mike Neily will also count heavily on right-handed pitchers Scott 
Diekmann and Ty Tout, newcomers to the varsity. But offense figures to be 
North's strength. "We seem to be swinging the bat real well," Neily said. "And 
we run well." The Saxons, who could meet El Segundo on Saturday in an 
attractive second-round game in the El Segundo Tournament, won their division 
in the Culver City summer league. Look for North and Culver City to battle for 
the Ocean League title. 
</P>
<P>
2. El Segundo (22-9) -- Although El Segundo returns only one starter, the good 
news for Eagle fans is that a promising group of players from last year's 26-2 
junior varsity team will fill out the squad. The bad news is that arguably the 
most promising of the newcomers, left-handed pitcher Jason Wayt, is sidelined 
indefinitely with an injury to his throwing arm. With Wayt out of the picture, 
El Segundo will count on a pair of right-handers -- junior Rob Croxall and 
senior Rick Clark -- to carry the pitching load. 
</P>
<P>
Center fielder Erik Evans returns after hitting .349 last year. An all-CIF 
running back who signed to play football for Hawaii, Evans figures to be the 
spiritual leader of a young El Segundo team. Junior Mark Lewis, a transfer from 
Rolling Hills, will start at shortstop. Coach Stevenson is also high on catcher 
Garret Quantance, a junior with a strong arm and bat. Inexperience is the main 
concern. "I never had a team that is totally new like this," said Stevenson. 
"It's kind of exciting to see what's going to happen." El Segundo and St. 
Bernard are considered the favorites in the Camino Real League. 
</P>
<P>
3. St. Bernard (22-4) -- Melendez showed Saturday that he hasn't lost his 
touch. In a scrimmage with University of West L.A., he homered to center field 
against all-City pitcher Eric Alexander. His coach, Bob Yarnall, says Melendez 
has made greater strides as a pitcher. "I would say his pitching has improved 
more than anything," he said. "With an off-season weight program, he picked up 
eight to 10 miles per hour on his fastball. He also picked up a knuckle ball, 
which looks pretty good. With a curveball and change-up, he's got four good 
pitches." 
</P>
<P>
Melendez's supporting cast lacks experience -- none were varsity starters last 
year -- but they are talented, Yarnall said. Right-handed pitcher Al Ibarra 
could not play for the varsity last season because his family did not move 
after he transferred from Culver City. So, he terrorized junior varsity teams, 
pitching two no-hitters and carrying an 0.12 ERA. He'll be the Vikings' No. 2 
pitcher and cleanup hitter. Big things are also expected from catcher Greg 
Pennell, center fielder Chris Richardson and freshman shortstop Grant Hohman, 
whom Yarnall compares to Clayton at the same age. 
</P>
<P>
4. San Pedro (20-6) -- Coach Jerry Lovarov is back for his 28th season with a 
seasoned team that returns five starters and seven lettermen from last year's 
league co-championship squad. Senior right-hander Joey Camello, who posted a 
6-0 record and perfect 0.00 ERA in the Marine League last year, heads the 
pitching staff. Other returners are junior catcher Dale Johnson (.313), 
outfielders Matthew Rasband (.383) and Joey Miller and second baseman Ken 
Stapleton. Willie Sanchez, a varsity starter as a sophomore who did not play 
last season, is penciled in at shortstop, where Rasband played in 1988. San 
Pedro and Banning are expected to battle for the league title, but what else is 
new? They tied for the crown last season. 
</P>
<P>
5. Banning (21-8) -- The Pilots, who have built a reputation as overachievers, 
won't be able to sneak up on anybody this season. They boast an experienced 
team headed by five returning starters. All-leaguer Chico Limas is the top 
pitcher and will catch when he's not on the mound. Second baseman Eric Fierro 
and shortstop Jesse Espinoza, first-team all-league picks last year, will add 
to Banning's strength up the middle. Coach Syl Saavedra is also counting on 
third baseman Julian Pardo and Jesus Olea, who will split time at pitcher and 
first base. 
</P>
<P>
6. Redondo (30-3) -- Many coaches are overlooking the Sea Hawks because of the 
loss of Davison and six other starters, but first-year Coach Tim Ammentorp says 
that could be a mistake. "When we started, I was concerned," he said. "But 
things have really improved." Redondo will rebuild around second baseman Brian 
Davison and catcher Robbie Zeller, the lone returning starters. Brian, a 
junior, is Scott's brother. Others who look promising are shortstop-pitcher 
Mike Houck, center fielder Ronnie Brooks and two young pitchers: sophomore 
Brian Fitzgerald and freshman Frank Bignami, both right-handers. 
</P>
<P>
7. Serra (14-16) -- The Cavaliers ended a 14-year drought last season by 
qualifying for the Southern Section playoffs. Now, second-year Coach Darren 
Fleming says they are ready to make a run for the Camino Real League title. 
Serra's experienced team is led by seven returning starters. Most notable are 
all-league outfielder Torrie Sweet (.480), third baseman Chris Jones (.340), 
catcher Mack Davis (.300) and second baseman Kevin Kay (.330). But do the 
Cavaliers have the pitching to challenge El Segundo and St. Bernard? Jeff 
Hazelitt and Anthony Williams will answer that. 
</P>
<P>
8. Westchester (8-6-1) -- Coach Ron Kasparian says the Comets' hopes are riding 
on a nucleus of four returning starters. Left-handed pitcher Victor 
Darensbourg, an all-league outfielder last season, heads a group that includes 
catcher Steve Raack, first baseman Damon Slack and shortstop Jason Frank. 
Westchester figures to have its hands full in league play against Palisades, 
Venice and University. 
</P>
<P>
9. Torrance (3-18) -- Although the Tartars may have lost their top pitcher, 
left-hander Dennis Miller, for the season because an arm laceration suffered in 
a car accident, new Coach Jeff Phillips remains optimistic. Sophomore third 
baseman Antone Williamson, who batted .400 and was named all-Bay League last 
season, heads seven returning starters. Pitching will be the key. Sophomore 
left-hander Kris Radcliffe, son of former Torrance Coach John Radcliffe, and 
senior right-hander Ryan Siebert need to come through. 
</P>
<P>
10. Leuzinger (12-16) -- The Olympians expect to rally behind ace left-hander 
Tyrone Scott, who pitched several fine games last season but unfortunately 
found himself overshadowed in a league that included Redondo's Scott Davison 
and El Segundo's Heath Jones. Derrel Thomas, the former Dodger, returns for his 
second season as head coach. 
</P>
<P>
Other teams to watch: 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes could make waves in the Bay League with the return of two 
first-team all-league selections: second baseman Lance Haworth and outfielder 
Spuds Powell. On the other side of the Peninsula, Miraleste boasts first 
baseman Chad Somers, who hit .444 with 11 homers and 41 RBIs last year. 
</P>
<P>
First-year Coach Jim Beaumont of Mira Costa has five starters back, including 
all-Ocean League catcher David Jund (.400). Lester Sakurai, the new coach at 
Hawthorne, will rely on standout shortstop Ken Alexander (.413) in the Bay 
League. 
</P>
<P>
A young Bishop Montgomery team will find the going tough in the Angelus League, 
but senior right-hander Erik Russell should keep the Knights close in games 
that he pitches. South Torrance, under new Coach Marc Gerhardt, returns 
all-league shortstop Andy MacTaggart. 
</P>
<P>
Chadwick is considered a challenger in the Prep League with the return of 
left-handed pitcher Greg O'Riordan and catcher Todd Seneker, both all-league 
picks in 1988.

Bell-Jeff 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Hal Krug, 11th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 5-14-1; fifth in league at 5-9 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Seniors Mike Cesta and Rod Arancibia will be the only 
seasoned players on a young, inexperienced and rebuilding team. Cesta, one of 
six Bell-Jeff players to hit .300 or better last season, is the only returnee 
-- four graduated in June and the other, Paul Izquierdo (.353), is academically 
ineligible. Cesta hit a team-high .406 last season and will be counted on for 
more this year. Arancibia was 4-5 with a 2.75 ERA and nine complete games. The 
only other seniors expected to crack the lineup are Russ Pisa or Tony 
Armendariz, who are competing in left field. Otherwise, the starters are apt to 
be underclassmen, including sophomores Tony Cesta, Mike's brother, behind the 
plate and left-hander Brett Lindsey on the mound. Jason Stanley will replace 
his graduated brother, Tom, at shortstop and fellow juniors Kurt Pitino and 
Marvin Martinez are expected to start at second and third base, respectively. 
Steve Knezevich, a fast player with a good arm, according to Krug, will start 
in center field. Freshman Iggy Castro should also see plenty of time in the 
outfield. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Krug had no qualms about his team's chances. "We're very young and 
inexperienced," he said. "We're going to need magical seasons from our seniors 
in order to challenge for a playoff spot. We know we have an uphill battle, but 
it should be an interesting and challenging season." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chaminade 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Steve Costley, second season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 18-7-1; second in league at 11-2-1 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: With five starters -- including its top starting pitcher -- 
returning from a team that advanced to the second round of the Southern Section 
2-A Division playoffs, Chaminade should be more balanced and experienced this 
season and capable of challenging Notre Dame for the league title. Seniors Tony 
Collatos, J.D. Choy, Greg Baumgartner and Pete Miller all started last season. 
Collatos, a center fielder, led the team in hitting (.417), was tied for the 
lead in runs scored (22) and doubles (five), and was second in steals (10). He 
also had 15 RBIs. Second baseman Choy hit .277 -- despite a slump at the end of 
the season -- was tied with Collatos in runs scored and stole a team-high 16 
bases. Choy, Collatos, Miller (.283) and junior Colin Havert should also give 
the Eagles improved baserunning. Baumgartner, a right-hander, was 4-2 with a 
2.70 ERA last season. He also batted .317 and drove in 23 runs. Chris DeCristo 
is projected as the No. 2 pitcher and will be backed up by fellow left-handers 
Steve Sacchetti and Greg Galloway. Left fielder Jeff Burdick and catcher Justin 
Stark, up from the junior varsity, should give Chaminade potent three, four and 
five hitters sandwiched around Baumgartner. Sophomore Aaron Weiss will start at 
first base. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "I think it's between us and Notre Dame," Costley said of the league 
race. "I think Notre Dame would have to be considered the favorite, but I don't 
see why we can't challenge them for the league title. We've got a good 
combination of speed and power this season. I'd like to see it come down to the 
last game of the season."

<P>
COACH: Jim Brink, ninth season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 10-10-1; fourth in league at 7-6-1 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Although the Saracens don't have any great players, according 
to Brink, they'll possess an abundance of good players, including the No. 1 and 
No. 2 pitchers from last season as well as their No. 2 hitter. Bryan Jacobsen 
was 6-5 with a 2.58 ERA in 1988 and David Lee was 1-2 with a 3.82 ERA. Jacobsen 
is a power pitcher with a good fastball and an improved curve while Lee is a 
superb breaking-ball pitcher, according to Brink. Marty Holly, a three-sport 
star in football, soccer and baseball, hit .365 with four doubles, two home 
runs and 18 RBIs last season. The center fielder also scored 17 runs and stole 
10 bases. Robby Thayer (.329, five doubles, 16 RBIs, 12 steals and 16 runs 
scored) will return at catcher. Adam Rowins, Jimmy Jun and Robert Moffitt will 
vie in left and David Nichol and John Lurvey will compete in right. Tony Choi, 
a junior, will start at third until senior Oscar Rodriguez recovers from a 
dislocated left elbow injured during the wrestling season. Jay Borenstein will 
start at shortstop and juniors Chris Stone and Mike Wolf will battle at first. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "Although we don't have any outstanding players, we've got a lot of 
solid players who can do different things," Brink said. "The key to our season 
may depend on how well each player plays his particular role." Though Brink 
said Notre Dame should be favored for the league crown, he gave the Saracens a 
good shot at second.

<P>
COACH: Bob Mandeville, third season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 18-10; tied for first in league at 8-4 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: With five starters returning from last year's team -- which 
lost to Culver City, 7-6, in the first round of the 5-A Division playoffs -- 
the Knights are favored to win the inaugural San Fernando Valley League (4-A) 
title. Chad Ratliff, Kevin Crosby, Bobby Hughes, Chris Loman and Kevin Milligan 
all return to give Notre Dame a potent offense. Ratliff, the shortstop, batted 
.442 with five doubles, 17 RBIs and 28 runs scored. Crosby, the center fielder, 
batted .441 with eight doubles and 10 stolen bases. Hughes, a highly regarded 
catcher, hit .348 with seven doubles and 12 RBIs. Milligan, a junior, is a 
two-year starter at first base who drove in 20 runs last season. Senior Steve 
Martinez, sophomore Vinnie Orlando and junior Chris Prince will start at second 
base, third base and right field. Pitching is one of the few areas where the 
Knights are inexperienced, but Mandeville expressed confidence in sophomores 
Cary Wichman and Steve Colella. Both are hard-throwing right-handers. Juniors 
Mickey McGuigan, Anthony Fanara and Greg Andrachick will vie for the 
designated-hitter spot. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "We're very balanced offensively," Mandeville said. "Last year, the 
upper part of our lineup had a tendency to carry us. This year, we're going to 
be strong all the way through." Despite the improved hitting, Mandeville 
doesn't expect to waltz through league play. "We're not going to take the 
league lightly," he said. "To say we're going to walk away with the league 
title would be ridiculous."

<P>
COACH: Kevin Kane, second season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 20-3-1; first in league at 13-0-1 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Although the Valiants lost seven of nine starters to 
graduation in June, their top pitcher and hitter return. Roland De La Maza and 
Joe Cascione, both selected to Cal-Hi Sports' all-state medium schools team and 
to the Southern Section 2-A Division first team, are back. De La Maza (6-0, 
180) had 126 strikeouts in 79 innings last season and posted an 8-1 record. The 
right-hander's ERA of 0.80 led the Valley area and he pitched eight complete 
games, allowing only 49 hits and 23 walks. De La Maza also batted .426 with 
four triples, four home runs and 23 RBIs. Cascione, a shortstop, was a 
dangerous leadoff hitter with a .500 average, nine doubles, five triples, 30 
runs scored and 29 RBIs. Both players have improved, according to Kane, but the 
rest of the starters will be new faces. Herman Merchan, a junior, will start at 
catcher and be the No. 2 pitcher behind De La Maza. Mike Cassidy and Steve 
Perez will start at second base and center field, and sophomores John Smith and 
Carlos Concha will battle at third. Junior Mike Hoffman will start in left 
field. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "We're going to be good up the middle, but questionable on the 
corners," Kane said. "We're going to have a lot of inexperienced players at 
several positions. How they develop could determine how well we finish in 
league." Despite the presence of De La Maza and Cascione, the Santa Fe League's 
most valuable pitcher and player, Kane said the Valiants will be fighting with 
La Salle and Harvard for the third playoff spot behind Notre Dame and 
Chaminade.

<P>
Agoura 
</P>
<P>
COACH: John Crow, fourth season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 10-10-2; tied for second in league at 5-5-2 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Crow expected to have a solid pitching staff with returning 
senior Dave Aronowitz and junior Ken Teasley up from the junior varsity. But 
Teasley is academically ineligible, leaving Crow with a big void. "That really 
hurt us," Crow said. "I thought our pitching would be OK, but now I'm not so 
sure." Aronowitz, a control pitcher, was 1-3 with a 3.47 earned-run average 
last season and has improved, according to Crow, but he cannot pitch every 
game. Therefore, much of Agoura's success will depend on its offense. But the 
Chargers lost three of their top four hitters to graduation, including Mike 
Maggiora, an all-league selection who batted .465 with seven doubles, five home 
runs and 18 runs batted in. Brian Smith (.431), however, will return. Smith, a 
junior third baseman, had 12 doubles and a team-high 27 RBIs last season for 
the Chargers, who lost to Duarte, 6-5, in the first round of the Southern 
Section 2-A Division playoffs. Other returning starters include junior Josh 
Smaler at catcher and senior Mark Costas in left field. Seniors Nelson Townes 
(second base) and Chris Pittinger (outfield) also started last year, but both 
players just finished playing in the 1-A soccer playoffs and will have to work 
their way into the lineup. For the moment, seniors Zac Miller and Steve Klein 
will start in center and left fields. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Because of their lack of pitching depth, the Chargers will need to 
score an abundance of runs to be successful. "We're going to have to put a lot 
of guys on base and score a lot of runs," Crow said. "We're going to have to be 
very efficient when we get guys on base. We can't expect to win games by scores 
of 3-2 or 4-3." Crow added that Santa Clara should be the league favorite and 
that Calabasas is vastly improved.

<P>
COACH: Bob Wade, second season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 9-11-2; tied for second in league at 5-5-2 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: With only three starters -- catcher Dave Kalman, third 
baseman Eric Umemoto and pitcher Dan Glassman -- returning from last year's 
team, the majority of the lineup will be composed of underclassmen promoted 
from the junior varsity. Kalman, an all-league selection, hit .442 and stole 
eight bases last season. Umemoto batted .333. Glassman, another all-league 
selection, was 4-4 with a 2.80 ERA and had 70 strikeouts in 50 innings. Wade is 
searching for a No. 2 starter among freshman Brett Farlow, junior Eric Rothman 
and senior Scott Faer. Second baseman Brett Resnick will provide short relief 
for the Coyotes, who lost to California, 17-0, in the first round of last 
year's 3-A playoffs. Tom Lynch and Jody Wimmer will round out the infield at 
first base and shortstop. Lynch is expected to bat fifth in the lineup behind 
Kalman and Glassman. The outfield will consist of sophomore Tom Hoover in 
center, senior letterman Mark Hansen in left and junior Cary Brous in right. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "Our battery will be the nucleus around which we'll build our team," 
Wade said. "I think we can be better than last year's team, but we're going to 
be much younger. We don't have a lot of experience or depth, so that could hurt 
us. It's not like I've got a solid backup for every position out there."

<P>
LAST SEASON: 2-12-2; sixth in league at 1-8-1 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The Knights are led by Shane Wright at shortstop, who is 
probably the best athlete in the school, according to Phillips. Other returning 
starters are senior Mark Phillips at first, junior Reid Chobanian at second and 
senior Bryant Lykes at third. Junior Colyn Van Buren will get the start at 
catcher. The outfield consists of junior Chris Robinson in left, junior Paul 
Berry in right and senior Dave Garcia in center. The pitching staff will 
consist of seniors David Ophus, Dave Unter, and Wright. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "Our team speed is great with Garcia, Wright and Van Buren in the 
lineup, so we should do very well offensively," Phillips said. "We hit .375 as 
a team in summer ball and we have the pitching to keep us in the ballgame."

LAST SEASON: 11-10; first in league at 9-1 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Keyaan Cook, a junior, returns for his third varsity season 
and is the cornerstone of the offense. Sophomore Chad Knighton will replace Pat 
Houston at shortstop. Two other sophomores -- Brent Polacheck at catcher and 
Andy Shaw at first base -- are also likely starters. Senior Chad Calabria 
anchors the young infield at second. The outfield features speedy J. T. 
Billingslea in left and Leleen Sparks in center. David Shmaess or Jason Gerber 
will start in right. The pitching staff will consist of senior Chris Anderson, 
junior Kevin Grant and junior Scott Saklad. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "With a young, but talented team, we look to have a good season," 
Steele said. "I look for us to be better in pitching."

COACH: Mike Henzie

<P>
LAST SEASON: 9-11; fourth in league at 4-6

<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Village Christian has its entire infield back except at 
third, where sophomore Matt Smay takes over. Other starters include junior 
David Brownfield at catcher, senior Kevin Ebenhoch at first base and senior 
Scott Danielson at second. Danielson batted .390 last season. The all-senior 
outfield will have Paul Heater in right, Greg Lloyd in center and Mike Curl in 
left. The pitching staff consists of Matt Bates, Smay, Curl and Drew Martenson. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "Everyone is pounding the ball," Henzie said. "We should win 15 to 18 
ballgames this year with the talent we have returning and the pitching we 
have."

</P>
<P>
Buckley 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Dan Gilmartin, first season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 2-17; sixth in league at 0-10 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Despite Buckley's winless league season a year ago, Gilmartin 
is brimming with optimism. Fourteen of his 16 players are seniors and 11 have 
varsity experience. The players had talent enough to win last season but lacked 
proper instruction and motivation, according to Gilmartin. "We actually can 
play with anybody in the league," he said. "I think we can finish better than 
.500." Catcher John Molina batted .464 in league play last season and will lead 
the offense along with Adam Glickman, a first baseman who hit .310 and drove in 
seven runs in 10 league games. Gilmartin is counting on improvement from third 
baseman Ponti Lambros (.285) and right fielder Spencer Rosen (.250). Gilmartin, 
who was the junior varsity coach two years ago, has coaxed second baseman Jesse 
Stills and shortstop Grant Chang, who didn't play last season, back to the team 
for their senior seasons. The pitching staff is thin. Center fielder Luka 
Pecel, who has never pitched before, may become the No. 1 starter. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Gilmartin, 28, expects to call upon his own playing experience as a 
motivating tool. Gilmartin was signed as a shortstop out of Monroe High in 1978 
by the Milwaukee Brewers and played for 5 1/2 years in the minors. "I think 
this team has the talent and tools, so it's just a matter of putting it in the 
right direction," he said.

<P>
COACH: Harry Morgan, first season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 14-9-1; fourth in league at 6-4 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Graduation cost the Contenders their top two pitchers from a 
year ago -- Shaik Nabi and Richard Leon. A year later, the two most important 
arms on the team belong to freshmen: right-hander Darren Wyre and left-hander 
Jeremy Pop. "I have to use them," Morgan said. "We don't have enough arms." 
Junior third baseman Wesley Doll has been asked to pitch, too. And 6-4 junior 
Bob Reed, who has never pitched, will become the top reliever. Fortunately, the 
team's best player will handle the untested staff. In a fit of overstatement, 
Morgan calls senior Peter Lutz, a league wrestling champion at 165 pounds, one 
of the Valley's premier catchers. He also likes senior center fielder Daniel 
Montgomery. "He's got an excellent arm and good speed," he said. The strength 
of the infield is up the middle in sophomore shortstop John Miller and senior 
second baseman James Kim. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Morgan, who has an .800 winning record in 10 years as coach of the 
school's 8-man football program, concedes that his team shapes up as a question 
mark. "Expectations? I have no idea. We're a mystery," he said.

LAST SEASON: 7-13; fifth place in league at 4-8 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Leading the offense is junior Frank Fernandez, an all-league 
selection last year who will play both first base and shortstop. Fernandez 
batted .397 last year with 17 stolen bases. Junior Robert Hernandez, who hit 
.388, will share time at first and also pitch. At second base will be junior 
Mike Zamrock, who should add to a strong infield. Playing primarily third base 
will be junior Mike Granderson and senior Jamie Kohls will handle the catching. 
Senior Scott Semer will head a young outfield. Hernandez and Keith Orford will 
handle the pitching. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "I've got some good talent and the kids from JV will make for one of 
the best teams we've had in a while," Porto said. "We will definitely improve 
over last year's finish if we can keep our pitchers healthy. I have a good 
group of kids and we should be in the top two at the end of the year."

<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Returning all-league players Scott Ziegler (senior pitcher) 
and Todd Creason (senior shortstop) and Gary Silverman (senior third baseman) 
form the backbone of this year's team. Expected to lead a young outfield is 
Jason Kane, who started last year as a freshman. Senior Mark Karr, a relief 
pitcher last year, will move into the starting rotation. Senior Mike Benjamin 
will handle the catching duties. Expected to contribute from last year's junior 
varsity are Todd Bachmeier, Erikk Cass, Ron Schaffer, and Dan Schaffer. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "We'll be strong with two returning pitchers," Veres said. "Fillmore 
and St. Bonaventure will be the teams to beat probably, but we'll be in the 
hunt if things fall into place."

DIGEST: ARIZONA'S COOK JOINS SELECT TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Van Nuys High standout Anthony Cook has been selected All-District 15 in 
Division I by the National Assn. of Basketball Coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Cook, a 6-foot-9 senior forward, is averaging 17.2 points and 7.1 rebounds for 
top-ranked Arizona. He is the Pacific 10 Conference's all-time leader in 
blocked shots with 261. Other players on the first team are Sean Elliott of 
Arizona, Hank Gathers of Loyola Marymount, Pooh Richardson of UCLA and Stacey 
Augmon of Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Second-team selections include UCLA forward Trevor Wilson, a junior from 
Cleveland High, and Bruin freshman Don MacLean, from Simi Valley High. 
</P>
<P>
Among those chosen for the Division II All-West team was Cal Lutheran guard 
Steve deLaveaga, who made the second team. Three players from California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. teams made the first team: Maurice Pullum of UC 
Riverside, Anthony Blackmon of Cal State Dominguez Hills and Troy Price of Cal 
State Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
John Keister of Occidental College was a second-team choice on the Division III 
All-West squad. 
</P>
<P>
Larnell Bush, a starting defensive back on the Moorpark College football team, 
has pleaded innocent to charges of assault in the beating death of John Flores, 
19, a Moorpark student, outside a party in Thousand Oaks on Jan. 20. Bush, 19, 
from Gardena, entered his plea in Ventura Municipal Court on Monday and was 
released on his promise to return to court March 20 for a preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
John Yurek, the brother of Moorpark football player Scott, was charged with 
manslaughter, battery and assault in connection with the incident. Flores died 
from a brain injury after a fight in the 2900 block of Avocado Court. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark Coach Jim Bittner said that Bush, a second-team All-Western State 
Conference selection last season, had planned to transfer from Moorpark to 
Allan Hancock College in Santa Maria. 
</P>
<P>
Another Raider player, linebacker Ken Haefliger of Thousand Oaks, was arrested 
along with Bush and Yurek but later released. 
</P>
<P>
Bittner said that Haefliger would not be disciplined. "To my knowledge, he 
hasn't done anything wrong," Bittner said. "It is my understanding that several 
people were arrested but not charged. He was just one of those people." 
</P>
<P>
Leslie Milke, women's basketball coach at Cal State Northridge, has been 
selected coach of the year in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. Milke 
guided the 14th-ranked Lady Matadors to a 20-7 regular-season record. Included 
was a 67-61 upset of conference champion Pomona, CSUN's first win over the Lady 
Broncos in 30 games. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Bridgette Ealy and center Chris Cavalin of Northridge were All-CCAA 
selections. Ealy averaged 14 points and six rebounds during the conference 
season. Cavalin averaged 15 points and 10 rebounds. Cathy Gooden and Niki 
Bracken of Pomona, Lupe Quintana of Cal State Los Angeles and Patti Held of UC 
Riverside were the other first-team selections. Gooden, an All-American in 
1988, was player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN's Julie Arlotto and Vicki Mallett received honorable mention.

LA JOLLA COUNTRY DAY WINS ON SCHOEPFLIN FREE THROWS

It was only fitting that Isabel Schoepflin got the winning free throws in La 
Jolla Country Day's 49-47 victory over Calvin Christian in the Division V 
girls' basketball championships Thursday at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Jack Wigley said no one wanted the victory more than Schoepflin, who had 
played every minute the past two games. 
</P>
<P>
"She's got tremendous timing for a sophomore," Wigley said. 
</P>
<P>
Schoepflin, who started last year as a freshman, was a first-team all-league 
selection this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Torres (17-5) not only defended their division championship, they also got 
revenge on the Crusaders (23-2), who had defeated them twice this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we won it because we wanted to win it after they beat us twice," 
Schoepflin said. 
</P>
<P>
With less than a minute to play, Betsy Wilgenburg made a steal and drove 
downcourt for a layup to put Calvin Christian ahead, 47-46. Schoepflin was 
fouled with 35 seconds left and made one of two free throws to tie the score, 
47-47. Nine seconds later, Schoepflin was fouled again and this time made both 
free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Calvin Christian, which led most of the game, had a chance to win but missed 
two layups in the final 10 seconds. The Crusaders led throughout the first half 
but the Torres' Julie Corbo scored at the buzzer to tie the score, 22-22, at 
halftime. Calvin Christian's Betsy Wilgenburg scored at the third-quarter 
buzzer to tie the score again, 34-34. Schoepflin, who had only two points in 
the first half, led the Torres with 13 points. Nancy Dickerson and Robin 
Chatman each added 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Torres' goal was to stop Calvin Christian's 5-9 guard, Wilgenburg, who led 
her team with 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
"We went more man-to-man and tried to shut Betsy down," Wigley said. "She's 
tough to stop."

IN LONG HAUL, CALIPATRIA IS A TITLE TEAM

After stepping on the court together five times this season, Calipatria and 
Imperial high schools from the Desert League traveled about 120 miles Thursday 
for a sixth meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the site was a bigger than usual -- the San Diego Sports Arena. And 
the stakes were higher -- the San Diego Section Division V boys' basketball 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
But the Calipatria whammy was still in place. The Hornets won, 56-45, to earn 
their second consecutive Division V title and fifth victory over Imperial this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a natural rivalry for the kids," Calipatria Coach Wallace Williams said. 
"Our kids get more pumped up when they play Imperial." 
</P>
<P>
Especially 120 miles from home, in a championship game in the Sports Arena. And 
particularly when Calipatria (17-7) was seeded No. 4 and Imperial (13-10) No. 2 
in the tournament despite their regular-season meetings. 
</P>
<P>
The tone was set early for Calipatria, when Vince Coleman nailed two 
three-point shots in the first quarter to help the Hornets to a 16-12 lead. 
</P>
<P>
It continued through the second quarter, when a full-court press helped 
Calipatria increase its lead to 28-18 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the third quarter, Calipatria had a 44-29 lead, and it was all 
over. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman led Calipatria with 17 points, Mike Moss had 15 and Enrique Barraza 13. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach told me to shoot if I had the open shot, so I did," said Coleman, a 
5-foot-10 senior. "The first three-pointer I hit, I didn't even know I was in 
three-point territory." 
</P>
<P>
The Calipatria press forced 17 Imperial turnovers, but Imperial coach Kerry 
Legarra pointed to missed free throws as the difference in the game. Imperial 
made just five of 13 attempts, a bad enough percentage made worse by the fact 
that seven of its misses were the front ends of one-and-ones. 
</P>
<P>
"They outplayed us and outhustled us," Legarra said. "The game was lost at the 
free-throw line." 
</P>
<P>
Brian Williams scored 12 points for Imperial, which played without 6-foot-5 
center Fabian Diaz. The Desert League's most valuable player this season, Diaz 
averaged 15 points and 11 rebounds a game. He sprained an ankle in Imperial's 
semifinal victory over Marian.

PEOPLE: EDWIN MAJOR FILLS MANAGING DIRECTOR POST AT WELLS FARGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Edwin F. Major has joined Wells Fargo Bank in the newly created position of 
managing director. He will be responsible for developing new corporate and 
private banking business in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
For the past seven years, Major was executive director of Merrill Lynch Private 
Capital in Los Angeles, a unit of the New York brokerage that provided loans 
and other financial services for individual investors. It was merged into other 
parts of the brokerage last year. 
</P>
<P>
Major, 62, also spent 17 years as an executive with Union Bank in Los Angeles, 
where his colleagues included Carl E. Reichardt, now chairman and chief 
executive of Wells Fargo, and Paul Hazen, president of Wells Fargo. 
</P>
<P>
One of Major's employees at Union was John F. Grundhofer, who is now his boss 
as Wells Fargo's vice chairman for Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Bringing in Major is a clear attempt by the San Francisco-based bank to expand 
its presence in two highly competitive banking areas in Southern California -- 
services for medium-sized companies and private banking, which offers special 
financial services to wealthy individuals. 
</P>
<P>
"We have decided to rifle-shoot various target businesses and these are two," 
Grundhofer said in an interview Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
A number of large banks from outside the state are competing with California 
institutions for customers in those two areas. Among them are New York's 
Citibank, two Chicago-based institutions, Contintental Bank and Northern Trust, 
as well as such foreign banks as Credit Suisse and Swiss Bank Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Wells has been trying to beef up its private banking division during the past 
three years. A key selling point has been the expertise that the bank has 
gained managing $60 billion in assets for institutional investors. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo recently became one of the few banks in the country to open a 
full-service brokerage, and it is using that new network plus its private 
banking division in an attempt to market new services for individual investors. 
</P>
<P>
Major, who has extensive contacts among middle-market businesses from his days 
at Union, said he plans to divide his time equally between developing new 
corporate business and expanding the private banking operation. DOUGLAS FRANTZ

<P>
The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply rose in the week ended 
Feb. 20, the Federal Reserve Board reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed said the measure known as M2 increased to a seasonally adjusted 
$3,076.7 billion from $3,069.5 billion the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted $3,945.9 
billion from $3,926.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a seasonally adjusted 
$789.5 billion from $784.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank 
travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts such as savings deposits and money 
market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less liquid accounts such as certificates of 
deposit in minimum denominations of $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated that it is monitoring the 
value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short- and 
long-term interest rates.

'LEAN ON ME' LEANS HEAVILY ON FREEMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, Times Film Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After its prologue, "Lean on Me"(citywide) opens on a maelstrom of 
choreographed violence at Eastside High School in Paterson, N. J., which 
practically guarantees that no one will glance at the credits below. As the 
camera prowls hallways and bathrooms of this predominantly black and low-income 
school, a sea of kids are picking fights or buying dope at the school door, and 
a teacher is being beaten into insensibility. 
</P>
<P>
This, the film assures us, was standard behavior until the arrival of tough new 
principal Joe Clark, who would turn the place around through flamboyantly 
radical behavior. Clark is played by Morgan Freeman, possibly the most 
formidable actor on the American scene. 
</P>
<P>
As anyone who has seen him on stage in "Driving Miss Daisy" knows, he is 
boundlessly gentle. He can also suggest menace so dangerous that you shiver 
("Street Smart"). He has a seemingly limitless range, quicksilver modulation, 
surprise, a dry humor and a watchful intelligence. Using words alone, he can 
pound another actor right into the ground. Morgan Freeman is not an actor to 
mess with. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't for his gentle side that he was chosen as Joe Clark. If the 
bullhorn-and-baseball-wielding educator was going to have his inning on the 
screen, he couldn't have prayed for better casting than Morgan Freeman. And it 
is Freeman who will give thoughtful audiences their thorniest problems in "Lean 
on Me." When director John Avildsen ("Rocky," "The Karate Kid") turns up the 
heat, staging scenes like that high-school-from-hell opener, or a massive rally 
at the close, or the many moments of confrontation that dot the film, and then 
sends Freeman in, against the action, to impose his strength by sheer force of 
will, it's thrilling. If ever an actor needed a bullhorn less, it's Freeman. 
</P>
<P>
He makes you forget -- want to forget -- the words that Michael Schiffer's 
script puts so clearly in the mouth of a music teacher: that Clark is a bully, 
a despicable man, and one who seems to be threatened by any opinion that runs 
counter to his own. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with "Lean on Me" is a stripped-down script with no room left in it 
for complexities, and revved-up direction that makes it move anyway. Schiffer 
trots out some of the arguments of Clark's opponents, then drops them. But even 
more crucially, he doesn't suggest that there is any educational alternative to 
invective, to the expulsion of 300 students Clark characterized as "hoodlums," 
and to the baseball bat. 
</P>
<P>
The choral music teacher, played feelingly by Robin Bartlett, is fired before 
the film is a third over. Every person who opposes Clark is either 
power-hungry, like Lynne Thigpen's leader of the parents group, or corrupt, 
like the fictionalized mayor. There's no middle ground to take. 
</P>
<P>
As in "Stand and Deliver," everything is geared to previously unmotivated 
students taking a test crucial to the survival of the school. And the producers 
have chosen cannily; Avildsen is masterly at mounting a slow-building 
school-wide frenzy leading up to a minimum basic skills exam. 
</P>
<P>
Clark's only ally is his friend of more than 20 years, Frank Napier (Robert 
Guillaume), now Paterson's superintendent of schools. (Guillaume has a 
sympathetic presence, but years of television have left him no match for 
Freeman's crackle and authority, and scenes in which he must dominate Freeman 
are awkward.) 
</P>
<P>
Clark's vice principal, Joan Levias (Beverly Todd), hates his methods but not 
his objectives. A few of the students are characterized: stocky young Thomas 
Sams (winning newcomer Jermaine Hopkins), and Kaneesha Carter (Karen Malina 
White), as the daughter of a young welfare mother whose upward progress is 
marred by a sudden personal crisis. 
</P>
<P>
You may remember none of the actors, because almost no meat has been put on 
their characters' bones. Then, in the middle of all this forgettability, there 
is Regina Taylor as Mrs. Carter, that young welfare mother, explaining why she 
has seemingly turned her back on her daughter. It is a scene of such power, 
variety and observation as to send you away shaken. This is an actress to 
watch. 
</P>
<P>
The real Joe Clark has very nearly created more problems than he has solved. 
True, his students work in graffiti-free and drug-free halls, prowled 
tirelessly by Clark himself. But, glossed over by the film makers are some of 
the statistics of his administration: Reading scores among his seniors are 
still in the bottom third of the country, and the overall dropout rate has 
risen from 13% to 21%. 
</P>
<P>
Those details are not on the screen, which rocks with positive messages of 
uplift and self-pride. Those are marvelous qualities, not reinforced often 
enough in mass-audience films with nearly all-black casts. But should it be too 
much to ask that a film with this much of a lock on its audience's emotions 
also challenge their minds? Clark's way or anarchy: It's not much of a choice.

STRONG CAST, BUT LITTLE WARMTH IN 'OUT COLD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, Times Film Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To watch nifty actors try to breathe a little life into torpid, tacky material 
is bad enough. When, in the case of "Out Cold" (selected theaters), the talents 
squandered are those of John Lithgow, Teri Garr and Randy Quaid, it feels like 
a criminal offense. 
</P>
<P>
"Out Cold" clearly sees itself as black comedy of the "Blood Simple" vein, when 
it's really only misfired situation comedy with a little dirt under its 
fingernails. From the stylishness of the titles comes a note of hope that this 
may be something promising -- a photo collage it's telling us that Garr, 
Lithgow and his buddy, Bruce McGill, have been pals since high school, through 
the Army and back into civilian life; that Garr and McGill have married and 
that the men have opened a modest butcher shop together. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, that's it for the charm. Picking them up a decade or more later, Lithgow 
is a wimp, McGill a bully and Garr a ditzy version of a James M. Cain dangerous 
dame. When McGill slaps her around, Garr hires Quaid, the lowest rent detective 
on the San Pedro docks, to document her husband's philandering. The inept Quaid 
gets something more; photos of what he thinks is a liaison, but is actually 
evidence of a murder, involving Lithgow, Garr and McGill, only one of them 
innocently. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of the humor in the George Malko, Leonard Glasser script comes from the 
appearance and disappearance of the corpse, frozen -- in the butcher shop 
locker -- into a sort of permanent Highland fling. It's about this time you 
realize that this enterprise (rated R for language and grisly situations) has 
not a single character to care about. And also that, thanks to Malcolm 
Mowbray's flaccid direction, the corpse isn't the only one around to seem 
trapped forever. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, but audiences can be out, in the twinkling of an eye, an escape you might 
devoutly wish for this cast. Incidentally, this is the second film to mix Quaid 
and raw meat of very dubious origin. If this is a trend, it should be nipped in 
the bud, now.

BLAKE EDWARDS' LATEST ONLY 'SKIN DEEP' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Blake Edwards' "Skin Deep" (citywide) has a couple of the funniest moments 
Edwards ever devised; it has John Ritter's easy-to-take charm, but it ends up 
living up to its title far too closely. 
</P>
<P>
Ritter's Zach has it all. He's a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, a novelist 
and screenwriter. He has a bright, attractive wife (crisply played by Alyson 
Reed), who's a TV newscaster, a profession that in the movies defines the 
successful contemporary woman. He lives the Southern California life style at 
its most sybaritic. You have the feeling that this is a man who hasn't stepped 
outside Beverly Hills, Brentwood and Malibu for year, except possibly to escape 
to other equally luxe locales; by the end of the film you're left feeling that 
this may be true of Edwards as well. 
</P>
<P>
The film opens with a hilarious double whammy that starts Zach spinning out of 
control even before the laughter starts fading. From then on it's a downhill 
slide for Zach. Already plagued by writer's block, he gives in to compulsive 
womanizing, followed by incipient alcoholism and eventual impotence. 
</P>
<P>
"Skin Deep" is a film of moments, some of which are terrific, others 
considerably less so. The glamour girls, with their great sheafs of shining 
hair, are interchangeable, but there are nice turns by Vincent Gardenia as 
Zach's barkeep pal and by Nina Foch as his chic mother-in-law, perhaps the only 
woman in the world who has never been charmed by him. There's real sweetness 
and humor in Raye Hollit's body builder, and once again Edwards proves himself 
one of the few American film makers able, or willing, to present a gay couple 
(in this instance played distinctively by Peter Donat and Don Gordon) without a 
fuss. 
</P>
<P>
As adept as Edwards is at using humor to set off Zach's self-destructiveness, 
to capture the dark undertow of high living, he ends up letting Zach off the 
hook shamelessly. It's as if Edwards said to himself: "The poor guy has 
suffered long enough, and, besides, we're running out of time." 
</P>
<P>
Never has a happy ending been so thoroughly unearned. For all his charm, 
honesty and intelligence -- you have no trouble understanding his appeal to a 
wide variety of women -- Zach does nothing to help himself as he gives in to 
epic self-indulgence. Then in his turnaround, we're given the impression that 
stopping drinking and turning out a best seller are snaps for Zach. (That his 
wife would even consider taking him back after his progressively outrageous 
behavior is also confounding.) 
</P>
<P>
In short, "Skin Deep" is a male sex fantasy that says that if you're 
sufficiently rich, famous and good-looking, you can go into the most 
self-destructive of tailspins and still land on your feet without any real 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
It's chilling to imagine "Skin Deep" (rated R for sex and language, adult 
situations) without Ritter, who through sheer dint of his own likability, never 
quite loses our sympathy for Zach. (This admittedly may not be true for some 
women in the audience; NOW is unlikely to choose the film for a benefit 
premiere.) Ritter and Edwards clearly have a strong rapport and plan to work 
together again. Perhaps the next time will rate a "10."

JOHNNY OTIS COOKS UP A POTPOURRI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Johnny Otis, who opened Wednesday at the Vine Street Bar and Grill in 
Hollywood, has had more careers than most cats have lives: Drummer, pianist, 
vibraphonist, composer, music publisher, record producer, singer, journalist, 
disc jockey, author, but mainly talent scout and catalyst in the rhythm and 
blues world. 
</P>
<P>
The group he is now fronting constitutes a virtual retrospective of his musical 
career, with a cast that includes three brass, three saxes, a rhythm section 
and three vocalists. It's an unclassifiable cocktail of blues, mainstream jazz, 
soul music and pop singing, with Otis sometimes pitching in as an additional 
voice, though he functions mainly as pianist (usually in a Basie bag) and as a 
capable Lionel Hampton style vibes soloist. 
</P>
<P>
His first record hit, the 1945 "Harlem Nocturne," was revived as a solo vehicle 
for the fluent alto sax of Clifford Soloman. "Flying Home" was another bow to 
the past: Otis played drums on Illinois Jacquet's version, also in 1945. Of 
course, "Willie and the Hand Jive," a novelty hit for Otis in the 1950s, is 
still in the book. 
</P>
<P>
The Basie, Hampton and Ellington instrumentals constituted the backbone of the 
show. The singers, heard singly and collectively, did not reveal another 
potential star (Otis discovered Esther Phillips among others). 
</P>
<P>
Otis's Hampton tribute on vibes, an hour into the program, would have been a 
fine place to stop, but there was another half hour to come. Inexplicably, a 
male quartet, brought on as guests, sang three doo-wop numbers in a style that 
went out of fashion with the Ink Spots. La Dee Streeter made her way 
conventionally through "Lover Man," assisted by Larry Douglas, a tasteful 
fluegelhornist. Two male singers dueted on "Soul Man," with three more numbers 
still to come. 
</P>
<P>
Otis' son Shuggie, always an impressive guitarist, should have been given more 
to do. In fact, there may be more than enough talent in the orchestra to 
compensate for the vocal shortcomings. But the Johnny Otis Show has always been 
just that, a potpourri of diverse elements that aims to entertain rather than 
conquer the world with innovation. 
</P>
<P>
Otis moves out Saturday, but will be back for another run March 15-18. LEONARD

DONALD O'CONNOR KEEPS STUDIO CITY THEATER IN THE FAMILY -- LITERALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Show business was always a family business for Donald O'Connor. Now it says so 
on the door. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, he will join his daughter Alicia O'Connor and his son Freddie 
O'Connor on stage at the newly rechristened 68-seat Donald O'Connor's Family 
Theatre (formerly the "Show" Place in Studio City) in a revival of Brandon 
Thomas' comedy "Charley's Aunt." 
</P>
<P>
"They picked this one because they thought I knew it," lamented O'Connor, who 
performed the play 17 years ago at Chicago's Drury Lane Theatre. "But I don't." 
</P>
<P>
At 63, O'Connor's energy is still infectious, and after six decades as a 
performer, his career is going strong. The proliferation of videocassettes has 
brought his movies to a new generation; his club dates are often SRO. So why 
take on the costly, demanding, risky proposition of running a small theater? 
</P>
<P>
"The lady who owned the space passed away," O'Connor said. "Her son and 
daughter came to me and asked if I wanted to keep it. 
</P>
<P>
"Right away, I thought of my Freddie and Alicia, struggling in this business, 
trying to get somewhere -- and the lack of places to work. And when they do 
work, lots of times they have to pay for it. So rather than close the place, I 
felt it was better to keep it open, keep everyone going." (In "Charley's Aunt," 
O'Connor plays Lord Fancourt Babberly; Alicia is Ella Dela Hay; Freddie plays 
Charlie Wykeham.) 
</P>
<P>
Though he's happy helping the theater get on its feet, O'Connor is also looking 
forward to giving up the reins to his board of directors (which includes his 
son Kevin O'Connor, daughter Donna Quigley and son-in-law Mickey Quigley) and 
retreating to the sidelines in a supervisory capacity. 
</P>
<P>
He admits that a lot of aspects remain unresolved. Will there be a subscription 
audience? Will they give acting classes? Will patrons brave the bowling alley 
downstairs to venture into the unorthodox (yet soundproof) setting? 
</P>
<P>
Since O'Connor took over the lease 1 1/2 months ago, the activity has been 
nonstop. His children have refurbished the theater, painted walls, laid new 
carpets and built an office and dressing rooms. "The place is really up for 
grabs," he said. "We can do anything we want to in here. I'm sure Freddie and 
Alicia will want to do things that are daring: new stuff, new authors. That'll 
all be totally up to them." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, O'Connor has a career to tend to. After the play's three-week 
run, O'Connor will return to his life on the road; he is booked through the 
summer -- after which he'll start to put together a new act. 
</P>
<P>
"I come from a vaudeville family," he said, "one of seven kids. When I was 3 
days old, I was on the stage with my mother; she was at the piano till she 
could get back to the heavy dancing. My mother ran away from home and joined 
the circus when she was 13, met my father and had her first kid when she was 
14. That started the first act of the O'Connor Family." 
</P>
<P>
At age 12, O'Connor was tapped for his first film, "Sing, You Sinners." Between 
stints on the road, he racked up a dozen others -- including "Beau Geste," "On 
Your Toes," "Singin' in the Rain" and "No Business Like Show Business." 
</P>
<P>
When it came to raising his own family, O'Connor has also kept the kids close 
at hand. 
</P>
<P>
He has been married 32 years to his wife, Gloria, who he says "handles my 
books, handles my publicity, is my bouncer." Before the children started 
school, the family always traveled together; the youngsters would often join 
him on stage. 
</P>
<P>
He says of his enduring popularity: "There's an element out there that wants to 
be entertained -- and they can't find this kind of thing I do. And yeah, I 
think I wear well. I sing, I dance, I do comedy. I'm not threatening. 
</P>
<P>
"When you grow up in a circus family, the more things you learn, the more you 
get paid. So I can do straight comedy without the song and dance; I can do all 
kinds of combinations. Whatever's in at the time, I can fit into." 
</P>
<P>
Right now, O'Connor's content to wear the hat of theater proprietor. 
</P>
<P>
"Over 300 people showed up to audition for this play," he said. "If this place 
folded, there'd be one less theater for them to go and be seen. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I want to help my kids. But the point is, it's not just for them. 
It's for the neighbors' kids -- all the talented people out there. And we're 
trying to select plays with large casts, so we can use as many people as 
possible. Now hopefully, some talent agent will come in and discover them."

MUSIC A FAMILY AFFAIR FOR DAVID JACK; 
</P>
<P>
EVEN 4-YEAR-OLD SON HELPS CHILDREN'S RECORDING ARTIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, Heffley is a Burbank free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Children's recording artist David Jack tries out new songs on a discriminating 
audience -- his 4-year-old son Benjamin. "If Benjamin likes it, it's a go," 
Jack says. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Benjamin is on a roll: His dad's "Don't Wake Up the Baby" and "Dance in 
Your Pants" audiotapes were hot enough to be picked up by national 
distributors; "Dance in Your Pants" won the 1988 "Parents Choice Award" for 
excellence. 
</P>
<P>
Jack, a Philadelphia native, is CBS's manager of music operations, working on 
in-house programming and license negotiations. In his free time, he performs 
his songs. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday afternoon at 2, children and parents can hear Jack in concert at Kids 
Gym, 12526 Riverside Drive, Studio City, (818) 343-7116. Tickets are $2.50 per 
child, $5 per adult. 
</P>
<P>
For ages 1 and up ("a 9-year-old won't be bored," he says), it will be 40 
minutes of music and audience participation: singing, clapping and dancing. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Canadian children's singer superstar, Jack describes himself 
as "like Raffi, only hipper." (Raffi often sings familiar children's standards 
as well as folk and contemporary songs.) 
</P>
<P>
"I want to separate myself from the people who do the same 'Old MacDonald' 
stuff," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Jack, 29, dark-haired, wide-grinned and irrepressible, may or may not be hipper 
than Raffi, but his work has contagious appeal. "Dance in Your Pants" is a 
bouncy, professional mix of styles from jazz and gentle rock to Hawaiian 
ukulele. 
</P>
<P>
Lyrics, by older sister Susan Jack Cooper, a San Diego-based writer, are 
guaranteed children-pleasers: 
</P>
<P>
 "Suppose I said my tuna fish was calling on the phone? Or at my door was a 
dinosaur with a chocolate ice cream cone?" and "Are there 'tee-hees' in your 
T-shirt? Are there 'ha-ha's' in your hat? Do your shorts just hop and never 
stop? Well, what you gonna do about that?" 
</P>
<P>
The collaboration with Cooper, who "still calls me her kid brother," started 
when Jack graduated from UCLA with a degree in music education. It became 
serious when Benjamin was born. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking for some good children's music," Jack says, "and I found the 
same old rehashed stuff we grew up with. So we wrote our first song, 
"Sleepies." From there, we decided to do an album of lullabies that would give 
a child a sense of family. ("I like us, I like this family, I like this house I 
live in, I'm glad I'm me.") 
</P>
<P>
After that, writing a second album that "little kids could dance to" seemed a 
natural progression. Jack and Cooper are now working on a third, "Gotta Hop!" 
</P>
<P>
Since Cooper lives in San Diego, it means working on the phone and through the 
mail, but Jack says he always looks forward to their face-to-face collaboration 
"because I know we're going to laugh." 
</P>
<P>
Jack's Ta-Dum Production company is definitely a family affair. Jack's father, 
a retired music teacher, plays oboe on the tapes, and brother Louis plays 
piccolo. Jack supplies drums and keyboard as well as vocals. 
</P>
<P>
His mother, also a music teacher, serves as marketing manager. She took "Don't 
Wake Up the Baby" "to nursery schools and small stores until it was eventually 
picked up by the Columbia House Record Club" and other national distributors. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Vicky, a former nursery school teacher who is expecting their second 
child this summer, serves as educational consultant. Even Benjamin makes a 
vocal appearance on both cassettes. 
</P>
<P>
Jack says he writes his music not only for children, but for parents who "are 
looking for entertaining music that doesn't drive them crazy to hear over and 
over, music with a message in it somewhere that a child can extract without 
knowing it." 
</P>
<P>
But "first and foremost," he says, "our music says, 'Enjoy yourselves, be happy 
with yourselves and with the things that you can do.' " 
</P>
<P>
After the Studio City concert Saturday, Jack will do two free concerts: one in 
Pasadena at 1 p.m. March 11 at A Child's Fancy, 140 W. Colorado Blvd. (818) 
793-4085, and one in Santa Monica at noon March 25 at Quinby's, 1109 Montana 
Ave. (213) 394-1141.

KITCHEN KITSCH GOES HIGHBROW: CSUN SALUTES ART OF TOASTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Starting March 13, 43 different types of toasters will be on display in 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
This event will not be at the Broadway, J.C. Penney or any other department 
store. It neither marks the debut of a new concept in retro diners nor does it 
kick off a new retail concept a la "Toasters R Us" or "Toasters 'n Dinettes." 
</P>
<P>
The unadorned, off-the-shelf toasters will be exhibited in an art gallery. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not saying that these are high art," Philip Morrison, curator of the 
"The Toaster" show coming to the Cal State Northridge Art Gallery, said as he 
stood in a workroom amid the toasters being readied for display. "But I think 
that they do reflect architecture. They are like little buildings." 
</P>
<P>
The man who collected all these toasters isn't willing to go quite that far. "I 
think that they can be used as an index in thinking about American design," 
said Joseph Krause of Long Beach, who teaches design and other topics at Cal 
State Long Beach. "But I'm not sure they should be given more importance than 
that. Any aesthetic quality that gets assigned to them happens because some 
people simply like the way they look." 
</P>
<P>
Krause is one of those people. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they are damned interesting," said Krause, 65. "I think they are 
really neat." 
</P>
<P>
That assessment is tough to dispute. The stars of the exhibit with two 
subtitles -- "A Design Metaphor: 1905-1945" and "From Burned Fingers to Perfect 
Toast" -- are whimsical variations on the theme of a basic kitchen appliance. A 
Toastmaster pop-up toaster circa 1930 has a gleaming Art Deco design on its 
side that would look appropriate in the classic buildings of the period. Others 
come in a variety of shapes and sport imaginative geometric designs stamped 
into the metal or have a sleek streamlined look. One 1910 flat-top model is 
supported by Grecian columns and has all the ambiance of a funeral pyre. 
</P>
<P>
Krause began collecting them in about 1958 in the aftermath of a fire that 
destroyed the house that he and his wife shared on Mount Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like store-bought bread and my wife is a wonderful bread baker," he 
said. But he could not find a toaster that would accommodate anything other 
than the standard thickness of store-bought sliced bread. "The sleek pop-up 
toaster models that were popular in the '50s would only accommodate thinly 
sliced bread. Soon bread bakers put out only bread sliced thin enough to fit 
into them and eventually the toaster makers didn't have to worry about 
accommodating anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Krause found a solution and a new hobby in a St. Vincent De Paul thrift shop 
near Chinatown. "I was looking for 78 records, which I collected at the time, 
when I saw this neat old-time toaster that could adjust to different sized 
slices. It worked fine. I think I paid 10 or 15 cents for it." 
</P>
<P>
The type he found had a flap-type holder that closed over the bread and held it 
close to the electric filaments. The flap had to be turned to toast both sides 
of a piece of bread, but Krause was more than willing to put up with the 
inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
In looking at other toasters when he visited thrift shops, he noticed that this 
flap-type arrangement came in a variety of designs in the years before the 
product was standardized. He began to buy the models that caught his eye and 
had plans to include them in a book that he would write on American design. The 
toasters would show how the look of everyday products evolved. 
</P>
<P>
His two favorites are a sleek model with black handles that Krause 
characterizes as having a "classical form" and an ornate toaster that flips the 
toast over with the touch of a button. The latter is shaped like a heart and is 
called the Sweetheart model. "My wife gave it to me one year for Valentine's 
Day," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually Krause became involved in other projects and dropped the idea of 
doing the book, but he kept on collecting toasters until about 15 years ago. 
"It was sort of fun," he said, and they were not expensive. Krause said he paid 
less than a dollar for most of the toasters in his collection. "But they do 
take up a lot of space." 
</P>
<P>
When he and his wife moved into a former ballroom atop an old Long Beach hotel 
and renovated it into a unique living space, there was room for neither his 
toasters nor the many waffle irons and other vintage electrical appliances that 
he had gathered. 
</P>
<P>
He happened to be going through his boxes of stuff when Morrison, who knew 
about the collection, called with the idea of mounting a toaster show. 
</P>
<P>
These days, Krause said, he and his wife use a toaster oven when they desire 
well-done toast. But it's not as if he is completely deserting his old hobby. 
"I got that toaster oven for $4 at a thrift shop," he said proudly. He did 
admit, however, that he recently bought one of the newfangled plastic-covered 
toasters with what he called a "quasi high-tech" look for when he craves less 
crisp toast. 
</P>
<P>
"The Toaster" show will be on display until April 14.

For the Young Disabled, Studying Dance Can Be a Saving Grace 
</P>
<P>
In the dance "The Rose," the rosebud struggles to reveal a full blossom, as its 
petals slowly unfold. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen-year-old Sarah Anderson, who will perform "The Rose" Sunday, knows the 
struggle of blossoming. Since birth she has suffered with osteogenesis 
imperfecta, a condition in which her bones are easily fractured. 
</P>
<P>
Although the disease prevents Anderson from walking, it has not stopped her 
from dancing. "The Rose" will be part of "Michael Roberts: Patterns in Music," 
to be presented Sunday at the Pierce College Performance Arts Center by members 
of Bethune Theatredanse.

"I want to show people that people in wheelchairs can dance," said Anderson, an 
eighth-grader from Rancho Cucamonga. Her performance will represent Dance 
Outreach, in which she has been involved for the past six years: an educational 
program conducted by Bethune Theatredanse that teaches dance to disabled 
children, with performance as a goal. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson also will be among the Dance Outreach students who will perform at the 
White House in June, and proceeds from Sunday's concert will help finance that 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
"Dancing can be scary, but it makes me feel good. It makes me forget all my 
problems -- at least for the moment. I have to concentrate on what to do next," 
Anderson said. She dances by moving her upper body. 
</P>
<P>
Other dances to be performed by Bethune on Sunday will be excerpts from 
"Galileo, Jupiter and Apollo," a contemporary ballet choreographed by Zina 
Bethune, founder and artistic director of Dance Outreach and Bethune 
Theatredanse; "Patterns," performed in part by an actress who reads a poem; and 
"Magic Dancer," which tells the story of a magician who brings a mannequin to 
life, with performances by several young children. 
</P>
<P>
Bethune, whose dance company is known for incorporating multimedia special 
effects, views the concert as another opportunity for what she calls 
"collaborative art" -- a blending of various creative and artistic expressions. 
</P>
<P>
A former soloist with the New York City Ballet, Bethune introduced young 
Anderson to dance. Like her protege, Bethune has suffered from several physical 
ailments -- scoliosis, a curvature of the spine; lymphedema, a lymph gland 
disease that causes swelling of the legs; and dysplastic hips, which ultimately 
forced her to have two hip-replacement surgeries. 
</P>
<P>
"I had years of pain," Bethune said. "Dancing saved my life -- the passion, the 
art form and the obsession. I may well have been a cripple if it wasn't for my 
dancing. Most people are crippled by these medical problems." 
</P>
<P>
But if there is one thing that Bethune hopes Dance Outreach will instill in 
Anderson -- and the 600 other disabled children in California who are in the 
program -- it is the idea of "making all possibilities possible." 
</P>
<P>
"Most people underestimate their potential," she said. "Through their 
participation in Dance Outreach, many children exceed what they've been told 
they can do. So if we see potential as this vast open space, it becomes 
unlimited. Discovering your potential means you keep going forward." 
</P>
<P>
"Michael Roberts: Patterns in Music" will be presented at 2 and 7 p.m. at the 
Pierce College Performance Arts Center, 6201 Winnetka Avenue, Woodland Hills. 
Tickets from $8 to $15. For information, call (818) 719-6473 or 719-6474.

NAVY UNVEILS NEW PLAN TO REDEVELOP DOWNTOWN BASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMANDO ACUNA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a long-awaited unveiling, the Navy on Thursday showed off its preliminary 
plan for a sweeping redevelopment of its 16-acre downtown base and supply 
center just yards from the water's edge on San Diego Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, one of the key elements in the continued resurgence of downtown, 
envisions the construction of two hotels, three office buildings, a maritime 
museum and a 5-acre ceremonial park at the foot of Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic aspect of the proposed development is its size. However, it 
is significantly smaller -- by almost 40% -- than the proposal the Navy made 
public public three years ago in a concept that shocked city officials. 
</P>
<P>
But, even with the reduced size, it is a sprawling project of 3.25 million 
square feet. Instead of being gigantic, however, it is merely enormous. 
</P>
<P>
Another indication that the Navy has listened to the concerns of the city is 
that the proposed high-rise buildings, some potentially reaching as high as 26 
stories, are slender towers grouped away from the waterfront and confined to 
the rear of the Navy's property along Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
And, in contrast to the off-limits nature of the current Navy facility, the 
plan calls for three streets, E, F and G, to be punched through to Harbor 
Drive, providing pedestrians and vehicles more access to the bay. A 
180-foot-wide public promenade would be built on G Street as it cuts through 
the project between Harbor Drive and Pacific Highway. 
</P>
<P>
In two further changes, the Navy has converted 71% of what was previously 
above-ground parking into underground parking for a project that, in all, will 
handle 3,000 vehicles and has scaled back the idea of having a major retail 
center. Instead, the complex would have only minor retail uses. 
</P>
<P>
"The community spoke and we have listened," said Capt. Wayne Goodermote, the 
officer in charge of the so-called Broadway Complex project. 
</P>
<P>
Later, in comments to the Broadway Complex-Bayfront Coordinating Group, a 
committee of local officials and developers formed largely in response to the 
Navy's original proposal, Goodermote said, "What we have now is a wall . . . 
where no pedestrians can get through the site and there are no views. The wall 
that is there now is what we're preparing to tear down . . . for pedestrians, 
views and public use." 
</P>
<P>
Reaction to the Navy's plans were generally favorable, though some said the 
proposal is so large and complicated that it will take some time to properly 
analyze it. Given the fine-tuning, approvals and selection of a developer yet 
to be done, the first spade of dirt on the project wouldn't be turned until 
1992, at the earliest. And the project is so large that Navy officials say it 
will take 8 to 15 years before all phases of the project are finished. 
</P>
<P>
"The heartening thing is the sensitivity of the Navy," said Ernest Hahn, head 
of the Centre City Planning Committee and developer of Horton Plaza. He said 
the thin towers called for in the plan will preserve view corridors to the bay. 
"What we've found is that it's the bulk of the buildings as opposed to height" 
which tend to wall off the waterfront, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"For a first blush," Hahn said, "it's pretty well done." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego City Councilman Ron Roberts, who is chairman of the Broadway Complex 
committee, said the concept represents "far greater sensitivity than 
</P>
<P>
any of the private projects so far that we've seen." 
</P>
<P>
But Roberts said he is "hesitant to endorse it in every respect" until he has 
studied it more. He said there is the possibility of making it better by, for 
example, making the proposed 5-acre park bigger and more specialized. 
</P>
<P>
The park, dubbed "Harbor Green" by Navy planners, will require the San Diego 
Unified Port District to contribute about 1.5 acres of its Lane Field property 
across Broadway from the Navy buildings. If such an arrangement isn't possible, 
the Navy's project will be more dense, by about 250,00 square feet of office 
space, and will have only half an acre of open space. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Details to Be Worked Out 
</P>
<P>
Don Nay, the port's director, said such an arrangement is possible, but said 
details of the "contribution" must be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anything here (in the Navy's plan) is impractical or impossible 
to do," Nay told reporters. "I don't think anything that they show here is a 
sticking point." The park would also require a narrowing of Harbor Drive and 
the closing of Broadway at the bay. 
</P>
<P>
The concept proposed by the Navy is the work of ROMA Design Group of San 
Francisco, the same architectural and land planning firm the city of San Diego 
hired to study alternative sites for a new City Hall. ROMA has recommended that 
the city build a monumental Civic Center complex called "Capitol on the Hill" 
at the eastern end of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
ROMA president Boris Dramov said Thursday that many of the design and land-use 
concepts the city is trying to implement for downtown went into the Navy's 
proposal. Among those elements, he said, was concern for inland areas of 
downtown, such as the Marina residential neighborhood, and how they relate to 
the bay. 
</P>
<P>
Dramov said another planning concern was that the Navy property be redeveloped 
as an activity center for all the public, not just tourists. "The keynote is 
better access to the whole waterfront," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Value of $400 Million to $500 Million 
</P>
<P>
The entire project will have a value of $400 million to $500 million, Capt. 
Goodermote said. Originally, the idea behind the entire plan was for the Navy 
to trade development rights on its 16 acres to private developers, who in turn 
would develop for the Navy 1 million square feet of free office space. 
</P>
<P>
But the scale of development required to make that happen was called 
"unreasonable" by a previous Navy official responsible for the project, Cmdr. 
Eugene Talmadge. Instead, the Navy will pick up 20% to 25% of the cost to build 
its offices, an amount that Goodermote said Thursday is roughly equal to what 
its now paying in rent. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, Goodermote said, the Navy will need the city's help to keep the 
density down, primarily by the city giving the Navy some of the taxes generated 
by the private development, and to improve to the proposed park. 
</P>
<P>
The breakdown of the project -- bounded by Broadway on the north, Pacific Coast 
Highway on the east and a realigned Harbor Drive on the west and south -- is as 
follows: 
</P>
<P>
* Hotels -- The Navy's original plans called for 2,650 hotel rooms built over 
about 2 million square feet. The new proposal envisions 1,500 rooms 
encompassing about 1.2 million square feet. The hotels probably would be built 
first on two square blocks at the southern end of the project, between E Street 
and Harbor Drive, closest to Seaport Village. 
</P>
<P>
Height of the hotels would range from about 4 stories to 18 stories, with a 
maximum height of 250 feet. 
</P>
<P>
* Navy offices -- The Navy wants 1 million square feet on the block between E 
and F streets, across from its deep-water pier on Harbor Drive. While 
structures on the Navy's 16 acres would be razed, the Navy has proposed keeping 
one, called Building 12. The idea is to essentially gut the 450,000-square-foot 
structure and renovate it, mainly because it would be expensive to demolish. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is to build a 24- to 26-story building away from the waterfront and on 
the part of the block next to Pacific Coast Highway. The maximum height of the 
building would be 350 feet. At the bottom of the Navy building would be a 
55,000-square-foot maritime museum. 
</P>
<P>
* Private offices -- This is where size of the development will be contingent 
on creation of the 5-acre park. If the park is built, requiring the Navy to 
contribute a little more than an acre to the project, the private high-rise 
office will be about 650,000 square feet. This would put it at a maximum height 
of 300 feet, or 20 to 22 stories. 
</P>
<P>
If, however, the park isn't built, the size of private offices would expand to 
about 900,000 square feet, the extra office space being built on the reclaimed 
parkland. The original plan called for about 1.1 million square feet of private 
office space. 
</P>
<P>
The new plan has traveled a quite a distance since 1986, when the Navy's first 
consultant, the Goodkin Group of San Diego, proposed that the Navy consider a 
total development of 5 million square feet, including eight 400-foot-tall 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
For several years, the Navy has wanted to consolidate many of its far-flung 
regional administrative operations into a "corporate headquarters" on its 
choice bayfront land. But the Navy buildings on the property, including offices 
and warehouses, are squat, old and in disrepair. One building was constructed 
in 1921, and the most recent one in 1946.

NATIONAL URBAN LEAGUE IGNORES CALL FOR BOYCOTTING CONVENTION CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN and ARMANDO ACUNA, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Urban League will ignore a local black activist's call for a 
boycott of San Diego and hold its 1992 national convention in the San Diego 
Convention Center, a spokeswoman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The prominent black organization is reserving the right to change its plans 
between now and its July, 1992, annual meeting, but "at the present time, our 
plans are to hold our convention in San Diego as scheduled," said Janet 
Stewart, an Urban League spokeswoman in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The decision appeared to be a blow to the Rev. George Stevens' call for a 
boycott of the city and the convention center in the wake of the San Diego 
Unified Port District commissioners' Feb. 21 refusal to name the $160-million 
bayfront edifice for the late Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
However, an 85,000-member black fraternity has agreed to withdraw San Diego 
from consideration for its 1993 annual convention as a direct result of 
Stevens' call for a boycott. The organization, Kappa Alpha Psi, holds an annual 
national meeting that attracts about 5,000 people, said Randall Bacon, its 
immediate past president. 
</P>
<P>
"Our feeling is that San Diego is just not giving appropriate consideration to 
(a tribute) in memory of Dr. King," said Bacon, a Los Angeles city official who 
until four months ago was a deputy chief administrative officer for San Diego 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Bacon said the group's Western region will vote this month to nominate Seattle 
instead of San Diego for the 1993 national convention. That year's convention 
is likely to be held in a Western city, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens, an aide to Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) launched his "Tell a Friend" 
campaign the day after the Port District vote, urging people not to vacation or 
book conventions here until the convention center is named for King. He 
appeared on radio talk shows in several cities and contacted the Urban League 
about boycotting San Diego. However, no other San Diego black leader has 
publicly joined the effort. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Bookings Canceled 
</P>
<P>
None of the 344 organizations with conventions tentatively or definitively 
scheduled for the convention center from 1990 through 2012 has canceled because 
of Stevens' call for a boycott. Only one organization has a formal contract, 
which is usually signed within 12 months of the date desired. 
</P>
<P>
The Port District declined to vote on the tribute to King, instead deciding to 
convert the building's bayfront terrace into an "Avenue of Honors," whose first 
inductee would be the slain civil rights leader. 
</P>
<P>
That decision must now be reviewed by the San 
</P>
<P>
Diego City Council, which had supported the name change. Rudy Cervantes, an 
aide to Mayor Maureen O'Connor, said the Port District's suggestion probably 
will come before the full council during the third week in April. Both panels 
must agree on a tribute for it to become official. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens termed the Urban League decision "unfortunate," but said his campaign 
has attracted the support of the fraternity and the Unitarian Universalist 
Assn., along with local minority groups, which he declined to name. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's unfortunate, because (the Urban League) of all people should be 
sympathetic to the problem that we're having in San Diego, and, as a national 
Afro-American organization, they should be supportive even when others are not 
supportive." 
</P>
<P>
Erv Miller, a member of the board of trustees of the Unitarian Universalist 
Assn., said his 200,000-member organization has a policy forbidding conventions 
anywhere that discrimination is evident based on race, age, gender, disability 
or "affectional orientation." 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say for sure that they would not go there, but I know they would look 
very carefully at something like that," Miller said from Rochester, Minn. 
Miller said he was contacted by his daughter, who he said is a Bates staff 
member. She was not available for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Al Reese, spokesman for the San Diego Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau, 
welcomed the Urban League's commitment, which he estimated will mean $3.78 
million in income to the city. Stewart said that convention will draw 4,000 
delegates from across the United States and 12,000 others who would be on hand 
for daily events. 
</P>
<P>
"We are, of course, glad that they will be coming here," Reese said. "We put 
quite a little effort into getting them to bring the convention here, so we're 
naturally glad that they're going to be coming." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego City Councilman Wes Pratt, who opposes an economic boycott, also 
endorsed the Urban League's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I think San Diego has to come to grips with the fact that it should provide an 
appropriate tribute to Dr. King, but an economic boycott only exacerbates an 
already difficult situation," Pratt said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Pratt said the Urban League decision should not be viewed "as an 
indication that it's all right not to name the convention center" for Dr. King, 
noting that plans for national conventions are made years in advance and are 
difficult to cancel.

CHACON GOT $7,500 FROM CHECK CASHERS AFTER DROPPING BILL TO REGULATE THEM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblyman Peter Chacon was paid $7,500 by the California Check Cashers Assn. 
last year, more than half of the payment coming on the same day he abandoned 
legislation to cap the fees that check-cashing businesses can charge their 
customers, state records show. 
</P>
<P>
Chacon, in his annual statement of economic interests filed Wednesday, reported 
receiving $4,000 of the money from the check cashers' trade group, which had 
opposed the bill, on April 14, the day the bill was shelved in the Assembly 
Finance and Insurance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Democrat received another $3,500 from the organization three 
months later, according to the statement. 
</P>
<P>
Chacon said Thursday that the group paid him the money as an honorarium to 
compensate him for touring several check-cashing stores in Los Angeles and 
meeting with the association's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
"My visits were very revealing in terms of the difference between a 
check-cashing facility and a bank," Chacon said. "I believe now that most of 
them are charging a fair fee. There are probably some that charge excessive 
fees." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Nix Jr., president of the Check Cashers Assn., said the group invited 
Chacon to take the tour because his bill could have put many of the group's 300 
members out of business. 
</P>
<P>
"He knew nothing about our business," Nix, whose company owns 19 check-cashing 
locations, said. "He came in and talked to managers and employees and actually 
observed the whole process. We did our best to educate him to the vital 
services we are providing at reasonable rates." 
</P>
<P>
Nix said the amount of the group's payments to Chacon were "arbitrary." 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to show our thanks for him spending a couple of days with us, so we 
provided those honorariums," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chacon said he saw nothing wrong with being paid by a group that would be 
affected by his legislation. He said he got the idea for his bill by reading 
newspapers and had no qualms about taking money to be educated about the 
industry he was proposing to regulate. 
</P>
<P>
"They offered an honorarium, and I accepted it," Chacon said. "It's not 
illegal. I reported it." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the $7,500 for his two appearances with the check cashers, Chacon 
was paid $2,250 for seven other speeches last year, averaging $321 for each of 
those events. 
</P>
<P>
The state's political reform act 
</P>
<P>
prohibits legislators from participating in a decision that would have a 
material financial effect on any individual or business that paid the 
legislator more than $250 in the 12 months before the decision. 
</P>
<P>
That prohibition would not apply in the Chacon case if the money hereceived 
came after, not before, he participated in the decision affecting the check 
cashers. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the Fair Political Practices Commission, which enforces the act, 
has ruled that payments from trade associations are exempt unless the decision 
in question actually affects the association, not the individual businesses 
that are members of the trade group. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 73, a political finance measure approved by California voters last 
year, limits honorariums of the kind Chacon received to $1,000 a year from each 
source. The new rules took effect Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Chacon said the payments from the trade group did not prompt him to drop the 
bill. He said he abandoned the measure at the urging of Assemblyman Patrick 
Johnston (D-Stockton), chairman of the Finance and Insurance Committee. 
Johnston confirmed that he advised Chacon to drop the bill so that the issue 
could be studied in more depth between legislative sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"Only the author was supporting it," Johnston said. "The Department of 
Corporations was opposed to the bill. I felt the bill would not be successful 
in the form it was in, and there was not time to amend it and have sufficient 
hearings to consider it." 
</P>
<P>
As introduced Feb. 18, 1988, Chacon's bill would have limited the fees to 1% on 
government checks, payroll checks, traveler's checks, money orders or cashier's 
checks. Fees for cashing other checks would have been limited to 1.5%. Nix, of 
the Check Cashing Assn., said most check cashers now charge 1.5% to 2%. 
</P>
<P>
Chacon amended the bill April 11, three days before it was scheduled for a 
hearing in the Finance and Insurance Committee. The amendments raised the 
allowable fees to 1.75% and 3%, depending on the kind of check being cashed. 
</P>
<P>
In its amended form, the usefulness of the bill was questioned by the 
committee's staff, an analysis of the bill shows. 
</P>
<P>
"The allowable fees seem excessive and probably not warranted by the risks 
associated with items offered by the payees," the analysis said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Betty Yearwood, the committee's secretary, the committee voted 19 
to 0 April 14 to shelve the bill and hold it for further study after the end of 
the legislative session. Chacon said he agree with the action and didn't push 
the bill any further. 
</P>
<P>
The interim hearing that was scheduled to study the issue was canceled because 
not enough committee members could attend, Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
Chacon said he may resurrect the bill at some point. 
</P>
<P>
"There is probably a need to look into the issue further," he said. "The issue 
is not dead yet." 
</P>
<P>
The fees gave Chacon a total of $9,750 in honorariums for 1988, more than was 
collected by any other legislator representing San Diego, according to the 
delegation's financial disclosure statement. Sen. Marian Bergeson, a Republican 
who represents part of North County, collected $7,500. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Sunny Mojonnier (R-Encinitas), who was criticized a year ago for 
accepting $10,000 from a prison guards group after leaving her sickbed to vote 
for a bill the organization supported, reported accepting no honorariums in 
1988.

PILOT KILLED IN CRASH AT SEA WAS POW IN VIETNAM WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Retired Navy Capt. Charles Gillespie Jr. of San Marcos, who was shot down over 
Vietnam and spent 5 1/2 years in the "Hanoi Hilton" POW prison, was identified 
Thursday as the pilot killed in a civilian plane crash, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie, 60, was flying a turboprop plane 80 miles northwest of San Diego for 
Flight International Inc., a defense contractor, at the time of Tuesday's 
accident. He had retired from active duty in June, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred minutes after Gillespie finished maneuvers intended to 
simulate hostile aircraft during war games involving Navy air traffic control 
students tracking planes from ships, Navy officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was doing what he loved," said his wife, Helen. "I used to tease him about 
always having to flag him out of a plane, get him to land, just so I could see 
him. He was always flying." 
</P>
<P>
Wreckage and the pilot's remains were found just before dusk Tuesday, seven 
hours after the plane plunged into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"We really know very little. It went into a dive and just never came out," 
Gordon James, a Flight International executive vice president, said from the 
company's headquarters in Newport News, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie was a native of Meridian, Miss. He won his wings a year after 
graduating from the Naval Academy in 1951. He was a pilot assigned to the 
aircraft carrier Coral Sea when his F-4 Phantom jet was shot down over North 
Vietnam on Oct. 24, 1967. He bailed out and was captured. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie endured 5 1/2 years in the North Vietnamese prison before being 
released March 17, 1973. In the years afterward, he sometimes talked about the 
harsh prison existence in appearances before church and civic groups and about 
how his religious faith sustained him. 
</P>
<P>
During his military career, Gillespie won a Silver Star, the Legion of Merit 
and two Purple Hearts. 
</P>
<P>
Besides his wife, Gillespie is survived by a daughter and a son.

<P>
An early-morning fire Thursday in two abandoned buildings, at the corner of 
Kettner Boulevard and Broadway in downtown San Diego, is believed to have been 
caused by transients, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
It took firefighters 15 minutes to bring the fire, which began in vacant 
one-story businesses, under control, said Larry Stewart, Fire Department public 
information officer. 
</P>
<P>
The Metro Arson Strike Team suspected that the fire was set by transients who 
frequent the building. Two transients, who returned to the scene and claimed 
they were sleeping inside the building when the fire broke out, were treated 
for smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
There was no estimate of damages to the buildings, which are scheduled to be 
demolished, fire officials said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: ENCINITAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two of four suspects have been arrested in connection with the robbery of three 
illegal aliens early Thursday in the hills near the 700 block of Encinitas 
Boulevard in Encinitas, the San Diego County Sheriff's Department said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In custody are Daniel Lopez Bojorquez, 21, and Cuachtemoc Pennelas Parra, 19, 
both gardeners. Both men are from Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
The victims, laborers Jose Luis Orduno Gutierrez, 25; Santiago Castanedo 
Avendano, 33, and Eliseo Jarquin Zarate, 28, told authorities that four men, 
two of whom had 10-inch knives, robbed them of jewelry and clothing about 1 
a.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
One of the victims, Avendano, was beaten and suffered a fractured nose. He was 
taken to Scripps Memorial Hospital-Encinitas, where he was treated and 
released, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies sealed off the canyon and called in a helicopter to search 
for the two remaining suspects and other possible victims. Because of the 
amount of blood found in the area, deputies suspected there may have been other 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
Bojorquez and Parra are being held in County Jail on suspicion of three counts 
each of robbery, one count each of possessing stolen property and one count 
each of battery with injury, authorities said. Each is being held in lieu of 
$22,000 bail.

A 30-year-old man was in good condition after being shot early Thursday as he 
fled a burglary, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Wilson was shot in the left arm after a burglary at the home of Joseph 
Schimka, 55, in the 5000 block of Hilda Road, police said. Schimka told police 
he heard sounds from the garage just before 3 a.m. When he went onto the porch, 
he saw a man carrying a vacuum cleaner and yelled for him to stop. 
</P>
<P>
The man dropped the vacuum cleaner and was running away when Schimka fired a 
shot from a .45-caliber semiautomatic, police said. When Schimka went to call 
police, he said, his wife saw a second man run from the garage. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, who was taken to UC San Diego Medical Center to be treated for the 
wound, will be arrested in connection with burglary, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police found a truck about half a block away that contained Schimka's tools, 
food that was stored in a garage freezer and an electric floor buffer. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego County district attorney's office will determine whether Schimka 
was justified in shooting, police said.

LOW TURNOUT FOR PHASE 2 OF AMNESTY WORRIES INS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal officials warned Thursday that many applicants for amnesty may have a 
false sense of security about their long-term status in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego and elsewhere in California, authorities said, only about 13% of 
eligible amnesty seekers have submitted paper work for the program's so-called 
Phase II, which allows aliens who entered the United States illegally to remain 
permanently as legal immigrants. Most applicants have only been granted 
temporary legal status in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Amnesty seekers who do not apply for the second phase within 12 months revert 
to illegal status and are subject to deportation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Widespread Concern 
</P>
<P>
Most applicants still have at least eight months to apply, but there is 
widespread concern about the small number of applications, a shortfall that 
appears to be related to misunderstandings about the process and a false sense 
of long-term security. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our feeling that there's a lot of confusion in the amnesty world," said 
Harold Ezell, Western regional commissioner for the U. S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service, who addressed the issue during news conferences in San 
Diego and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Word of the low turnout comes at a time when educators in San Diego and 
elsewhere have already expressed concern about their ability to provide needed 
English-language and U. S. government instruction to large numbers of amnesty 
applicants, most of whom are required to demonstrate basic knowledge of the 
language and U. S. civics. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, about 1.8 million people applied under the general amnesty program, 
which was limited to foreigners who had been living illegally in the United 
States since 1982. Included are about 42,000 applicants in San Diego and 
Imperial counties. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't bring these folks this far just to lose them now," said James 
Turnage, INS district director in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the problem, INS officials announced a series of steps. Among 
other things, authorities said they plan to launch an "aggressive" public 
information campaign in newspapers and on radio and television, and will also 
establish information booths at amnesty offices, which, under an extended 
schedule, will now be open Thursdays from 7 to 9 p.m. and on Saturdays from 11 
a.m. to 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INS Criticized 
</P>
<P>
Some critics suggest that the INS itself has done an inadequate job of 
informing recipients about the importance of the second phase. Charges of poor 
community notice and outreach have dogged the service throughout the program, 
although officials have dismissed such allegations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"I think there could be a a lot more outreach and publicity," said Roberto 
Martinez, a community activist in San Diego who works with the American Friends 
Service Committee, the social action arm of the Quaker Church. "I have a 
feeling that people don't recognize the seriousness of following up on the 
second phase." 
</P>
<P>
In another step, the INS said it will allow recognized social service agencies 
to administer a 15-question civics test -- taken via video screens -- that is 
designed to comply with the English-language and U. S. government requirement. 
</P>
<P>
Those who pass the multiple-choice test -- which includes basic questions such 
as identifying major U. S. political parties and the U. S. capital -- are 
deemed to have met the standard. (Exempt from the requirement are those 15 or 
younger, 65 or older, U. S. high school graduates and those who received at 
least 40 hours of English and government instruction during a full academic 
year at a state-recognized school.) 
</P>
<P>
Those whose English skills are so rudimentary that the test is beyond their 
skills may meet the language/civics requirement by completing at least 40 hours 
of an INS-certified course, but some educators have expressed concern about the 
ability of school districts to provide the needed instruction. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, as in other areas, fears have emerged that federal funds designed 
to offset the costs of providing the classes to tens of thousands of amnesty 
applicants may not be available in time. Such delays could prevent school 
districts from hiring the needed instructors, causing some students to be 
turned away. San Diego educators say they have been able to meet the demand 
thus far, but they are uncertain about beyond this month. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to determine what we can offer based on the funding," said Ed Spies, 
principal of Montgomery Adult School in southern San Diego County, one of a 
number of facilities offering language and civics classes to amnesty seekers.

CONTROVERSY OVER TOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nomination of John Tower has gone too far. With wild accusations, Tower's 
detractors have tried to portray him as a man unfit for the job of secretary of 
defense. In fact, there is nobody better qualified than Tower for this 
position. 
</P>
<P>
Tower's history of alcoholism has been brought up numerous times as a reason 
for denying his nomination, despite the fact that there is no evidence to 
support the accusation that he is an alcoholic now. In case you haven't heard, 
alcoholism is curable. I wonder how an alcoholic can be chairman of the Senate 
Armed Services Committee, can chair the U.S. delegation at the strategic arms 
reduction talks, can effectively lobby for major defense contractors, and can 
provide "senior management" for several major defense contractors. This 
experience makes Tower the best qualified person for nomination by President 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Tower has also been accused of seldom meeting a weapons system he didn't like. 
He is being condemned by the very same people who have voted to fund those very 
same weapons systems. During the Reagan years, Tower was afforded the luxury of 
being able to fund any weapons system he liked, but this doesn't mean that he 
cannot function with a restrictive budget. It is not enough reason to deny the 
nomination because Tower may fail somehow to budget. 
</P>
<P>
John Tower has nothing against him and everything for him; his confirmation 
should not be delayed any longer.

COUNTY CONTRACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was angered and amazed upon reading about the severe problems afflicting the 
county's contracting-out program ("Delays in Repairs of County Vehicles May 
Cost Contractor," Metro, Feb. 17). Angry, because the problems so often 
associated with contracting public services to private companies were predicted 
and could have been avoided. My amazement stems from the new heights of 
arrogance that have apparently infected the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
When Proposition A (the passage of which allowed the county to contract with 
private vendors for services provided by county employees) was being debated in 
1978, the public was inundated with claims of increased efficiency and 
million-dollar tax savings that would result from contracting-out. Conservative 
supervisors and their ideological friends assured us that the private sector, 
by definition, was superior to the public sphere at providing goods and 
services. 
</P>
<P>
The County Federation of Labor argued against contracting-out based on 
practical experience, not abstract theory. Time and time again contractors have 
lined their pockets at public expense while providing inferior service. In the 
current case of county vehicle maintenance, the contractor, Holmes and Narver 
Services Inc., has given a whole new definition to the term "corporate 
arrogance." When faced with a backlog of unrepaired buses caused by their own 
incompetence, they responded by asking the county to purchase newer, easier to 
maintain vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The drive to contract-out public services has never really been based on 
economic decisions. Numerous independent studies have demolished the 
exaggerated claims of contractor cost savings. The decision to contract-out is 
and has always been a political decision -- a right-wing loyalty to an outdated 
ideology and a mean-spirited attack on the public domain. 
</P>
<P>
We need to preserve the noble ideas of public service and community in this 
country. The only virtue of this fiasco is that people will begin to realize 
that the work of community preservation will not be done by the likes of Holmes 
and Narver Inc. The public will come to know what those of us in organized 
labor learned long ago through confrontation with hard reality. It is easy to 
call forth the gods of profit to create a kinder and gentler nation. It is much 
more difficult to make them do our bidding.

Wouldn't it be neat if Tower was appointed secretary of defense and on the same 
day Ollie North was acquitted of all charges? And the two events were 
celebrated on a national scale as a reaffirmation of the fact justice still 
reigns in the U.S.? That would surely be evidence of the "kinder, gentler 
society" President Bush has promised us. Only a terrible cynic could fail to 
recognize that truth, honesty, decency and sobriety still prevail when we 
select leaders to admire.

In the matter of Tower, President Bush is behaving like a petulant child. His 
having to picture a future without Tower, the arrogant gnome from Texas, really 
shouldn't be all that difficult. Millions of us, after all, have had to accept 
the fact that Michael Dukakis isn't President. If we can live with our 
disappointment, George Bush should be able to live with his.

I don't know if Tower is qualified to be secretary of defense, and I certainly 
can't tell based on innuendo reported in the media whether he has a drinking 
problem, but I think his pledge to abstain from alcohol was poorly made (Part 
I, 27). The question regarding Tower's drinking is, does he have a problem 
serious enough to make him unfit for office? By now, the Senate should have 
sufficient evidence to determine if he does. 
</P>
<P>
We don't need the precedent of someone swearing to a code of moral behavior to 
prove his suitability for public service. What we need is competence, 
experience and integrity in our leaders, not a willingness to promise never to 
drink, take drugs, smoke cigarettes or take the Lord's name in vain.

JAILS: FAST TURNOVER

Surely the word is spreading as fast as though it were being advertised: 
"Lawbreakers, listen up. Got a couple of warrants hanging over your head? Been 
busted for drunk driving, petty theft, possession of a couple of rocks of 
cocaine or some other misdemeanor? Don't worry. The Los Angeles county jails 
are so crowded that sentences of up to 33 days can be served and satisfied with 
only one day behind bars." What a travesty. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block has no choice but to release 
relatively minor offenders early. He must hold the jail population to 22,157 
inmates, tops. That's the limit imposed by a federal judge to relieve years of 
severe overcrowding. At that, the court-imposed cap is nearly double the 
intended capacity of 13,400 inmates for the entire jail system. 
</P>
<P>
The early releases began last May, with a few days being shaved from short 
sentences. Since then, nearly 86,000 inmates convicted of misdemeanors have 
gotten out early. Meanwhile, the number of days shaved off a sentence has grown 
from 1 or 2 to up to 32. What began as an emergency stopgap solution is 
becoming a more permanent remedy. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's main jail also is under court order to control crowding. Last 
year 43,000 people who were arrested either were turned away or given early 
release. 
</P>
<P>
Building more bunks behind bars is the obvious long-term remedy. But the best 
efforts to find new money for jails and to find places to build them when and 
if the money turns up have failed. 
</P>
<P>
California voters approved a $500-million state bond measure for jail 
construction, expansion, maintenance and rehabilitation in November. A total of 
$1.5 billion has been approved for jail construction in four bond measures 
since 1982. That's a lot of money, but it's not enough to keep pace with the 
surging jail populations throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, shortsighted county voters failed to provide a two-thirds 
majority for a $195.7-million local measure for jail construction in Los 
Angeles. That money was intended for several projects, including a 2,400-bed 
expansion of the mammoth Men's Central Jail near downtown and the 1069-bed 
Lynwood Regional Justice Center. Without these additional beds, more inmates -- 
including men accused of more serious crimes -- will quickly go free. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County, which needs to double its jail capacity by 1995, also is 
thinking of asking voters for money to pay for more cells in the form of a 
half-cent increase in the sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
As things stand today, a man convicted of a misdemeanor and about to start a 
jail sentence need not give up his civilian clothes and change into a 
regulation jumpsuit. No matter what the judge intended, the inmate will spend 
only a matter of hours -- just long enough to be fingerprinted, processed and 
booked -- in jail. Meanwhile, the standard 30-day sentence has become just 
another way of saying freedom.

CONTROVERSY OVER TOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So, the Democrats voted against the confirmation of Tower. Imagine, he has 
received large amounts of money from the defense industry. They must have been 
deeply shocked. And it was great to see Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) vote nay, in 
righteous indignation -- those rumors about Tower's sinning -- wine, women and 
song. Good for you, boys!

A COMMON CAUSE FOR PACIFIC BASIN; 
</P>
<P>
NATIONS SHOULD FINALLY ORGANIZE TO TACKLE TRADE, DEBT ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By W. W. ROSTOW, W. W. Rostow is a professor of political economy at the 
University of Texas at Austin. This is adapted from a speech delivered March 2 
at the Pacific Basin Symposium in Honolulu. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is now more than 20 years since a distinguished Japanese citizen, Prof. 
Kiyoshi Kojima, proposed that a Pacific Basin organization be set up. For a 
generation, a great deal of thought, technical skill and good will have been 
invested in elaborating the concept. It is proper that we have allowed time to 
turn the problem around in our hands, identify the interests that such an 
organization must satisfy if it is to be successful and identify the problems 
it must overcome. This interval also provided the time to develop an underlying 
sense of community. But there comes a time when symposiums and learned essays 
should give way to action. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, what the Pacific Basin requires now is an economic, not a political or 
military, organization. Existing security treaties and understandings appear 
adequate, at least for the present. On the other hand, there is much for a 
sound economic organization to do. But what kind of organization? 
</P>
<P>
Evidently, one cannot envisage right now a Common Market or free-trade area for 
a region with economies at such different stages of growth. In fact, a basic 
requirement for success is that countries at early stages of growth feel not 
merely unthreatened in such an organization but also look upon it as a source 
of support. 
</P>
<P>
What should such an organization do? And, especially, how should it begin? 
</P>
<P>
Clear thinking about the Pacific Basin has, by and large, been obstructed by 
analogies with the European movement toward economic unity. But the European 
experience does hold one good lesson for the Pacific Basin nations: The 
European movement acquired credibility when it proved capable of solving what 
was then the most important political-economic problem in Western Europe. The 
problem in 1948-1949 was how to ensure equitable access to the dominating coal 
and steel resources of West Germany. The solution -- fair to Germans and to all 
others -- was the Coal and Steel Community. The success of that enterprise was 
the political and psychological basis for the Common Market. 
</P>
<P>
In light of that lesson, the first thing a Pacific Basin organization should do 
is come to grips with the two biggest problems now obstructing political 
harmony and sustained economic prosperity in the region: the related problems 
of trade and the debts of many developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
So far as advanced industrial countries are concerned, I define the trade 
problem as the development of large, chronic surpluses and deficits, inducing 
in the deficit countries -- notably, the United States -- mounting pressures 
for extreme protectionist solutions. 
</P>
<P>
Before I make a concrete proposal on trade policy in the Pacific Basin, let me 
say something about Third World debts, for they are a substantial part of the 
trade problem of the developed nations as well as the critical barrier to 
economic growth in important parts of the developing world. (Incidentally, I 
assume a future Pacific Basin organization will include some of the major Latin 
American countries.) 
</P>
<P>
Just as we can't solve the surplus-deficit trade problem by exchange-rate 
manipulation without relinking domestic and foreign economic policy over a wide 
front, we can't solve the debt problem wholly by conventional financial 
measures. It is an integral part of problems of trade and growth in the world 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
For six years, we have dealt with Third World debts as primarily a financial 
matter: Creditor banks in advanced industrial countries lent the debtors enough 
each year to pay interest and pushed the principal down the road. 
</P>
<P>
The results have been appalling. In the heavily indebted countries, gross 
national product per capita declined between 1980 and 1986 at an average annual 
rate of 1.8%; gross capital formation as a percent of GNP fell by one-third; 
imports fell by 20%; the ratio of interest payments to exports doubled. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of this tragic episode of regression on the advanced industrial 
countries has been, of course, a significant loss of export markets. U.S. 
exports, for example, are estimated to be between 20% and 40% below the level 
they would have been if the heavily indebted countries had enjoyed normal 
growth rates. 
</P>
<P>
Proposals to resolve the Third World debt problem are of four broad types: 
Procedural reform (such as multi-year debt rescheduling and extension of 
maturities); changing the nature of claims (debt-equity conversions and 
interest capitalization); new institutions (an inter-governmental institution 
that would take over the direct claims of banks on borrowing countries and 
provide relief to debtors), and direct debt relief (a reduction in debt 
servicing charges). 
</P>
<P>
The time has come for bold, decisive action to end the Third World debt crisis, 
with Western Europe taking the lead in dealing with the African debts and the 
advanced industrial countries of the Pacific Basin taking the lead with the 
Latin American and Asian debts, notably those of the Philippines and Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
In a matter of this kind, bold, decisive action pays off, as the Marshall Plan 
proved. That plan was completed in a shorter time and at less cost than 
originally envisaged. In part, this happened because its scale and decisiveness 
raised morale in Europe and encouraged vigorous action by Europeans. In this 
case, an additional factor argues in the same direction: A bold, decisive plan 
to end the Third World debt crisis could induce a return of a large part of the 
flight capital that has complicated the task of the debtor countries. I suggest 
the answer lies in a new institution within which the World Bank and 
International Monetary Fund would play an important but not exclusive role, 
plus a substantial measure of debt relief. 
</P>
<P>
As a first step, therefore, I propose that a meeting of governments interested 
in exploring the possibility of setting up a Pacific Basin organization take 
place soon at the ministerial level. Its five-point agenda might look something 
like this: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Measures to end within three years or less chronic trade surpluses and 
deficits in ways consistent with high-growth rates, minimum protectionism and 
avoidance of major crisis in the international financial system. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Long-run rules for trade that would avert in the future the buildup of 
large, chronic trade surpluses and deficits and unmanageable debt levels, 
including rules relating the domestic economic policies of nations to their 
external trade and financial positions, taking into account variations 
appropriate to their stages of growth. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Measures to deal decisively and promptly with debt problems of developing 
nations in Latin America and the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Other possible Pacific tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Organizational issues. 
</P>
<P>
For each item, relatively small, expert groups -- well-balanced between 
advanced industrial and developing countries -- might be appointed to develop 
proposals for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
It is often forgotten that the pre-1914 world economy -- on which we sometimes 
look back with nostalgia -- was not held together by free trade. The United 
States, the European continent and Japan all mounted and sustained substantial 
tariff and other barriers to trade. What held the pre-1914 system together was 
the political acceptance of the rhythm of the business cycle as a kind of act 
of God. 
</P>
<P>
But severe, protracted depressions are no longer politically acceptable. 
Therefore, we shall have to manage our way out of the unsupportable current 
trade surpluses and deficits; and the rules of the game for the long run must 
accept a higher degree of management than our rhetoric -- especially the 
rhetoric of politicians and after-dinner speeches -- allows. 
</P>
<P>
It is time to invoke the great rule of Jean Monnet, one of the founders of the 
Common Market: Do not come together to argue and negotiate; come together to 
solve a common problem. And the problem is much deeper than free trade or 
protectionism.

Cleveland 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Ray Todd, fourth season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 7-13; third in league at 6-9 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Todd touts the Cavaliers as "the best hitting lineup I've 
ever had." Last season, Cleveland managed only five home runs -- three by Mike 
Bergren, who led the team with 18 runs batted in. Bergren graduated, leaving 
behind junior center fielder Pat Bryant, an all-league wide receiver on the 
football team who batted .346 with a team-high seven doubles and 15 steals. 
Senior Sean Burwell (.326) moves from center field to left. Senior shortstop 
Mario Valencia (.250) also returns and "can throw strikes when we need him to," 
Todd said. Senior Tony Holiday (.400), who underwent off-season arthroscopic 
arm surgery, is a newcomer to the mound. Senior Herman Rodriguez, who totaled 
just three innings last season, is the most experienced member of a pitching 
staff composed entirely of right-handers. Also expected to pitch are juniors 
Alonso Yeverino and Bob Macias and Bobby McRae. Senior catcher Bill Wickert 
missed last season because of arm trouble. Sophomore first baseman Tony Rangel 
(6-2, 200) could be an offensive surprise. Todd also expects senior Mike 
Morley, a reserve catcher, and junior outfielder Jason Thorne, a transfer from 
North Carolina, to make an impact on offense. OUTLOOK: Cleveland cries out for 
a power hitter. But if young hitters come through, the Cavaliers may have the 
last laugh. "Depth, pitching-wise, may present a problem," Todd said. "But I 
think we're going to surprise a few people." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Darryl Stroh, 19th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 15-5; third in league at 11-4 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Last year's team was one of the most disappointing in Stroh's 
career. The Highlanders had pitching, hitting and seniors at key positions, but 
something never clicked. "We had all the talent, physically, but we never came 
together," Stroh said. "This year's team is completely the opposite." While the 
Highlanders do not have the experience or talent of their predecessors, the 
team boasts a strong work ethic, Stroh said. "They aren't the best players, but 
they work hard." Only catcher Nile Bloom and part-time designated-hitter Glenn 
Hoppe (.323) return. Hoppe will start at third base. Right-hander Eric Clark 
and left-hander Mike Komsky are the projected starting pitchers. Clark, 
however, has had a long battle with elbow problems this winter and will be 
sidelined indefinitely. He will play first base when he is not pitching. Billy 
Biers will start at second and Gabe Miller at short. Miller also will pitch if 
needed. The outfield is considerably less stable. "We're not really set at all 
out there," Stroh said. "We really need to strengthen it." 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "It's a young group and it's not super-talented," Stroh said. "But 
it's as good a group of kids as I've been around in a long time." It may be a 
season of few runs. "It's one of the best bunting teams here in years," Stroh 
said. "And it's not going to be a team that scores a lot of runs -- we'll have 
to work for them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kennedy 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Manny Alvarado, first season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 19-10; first in league at 12-3 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Senior shortstop Gino Tagliaferri, a two-time Times' 
All-Valley selection, batted .375 last season with five home runs, five triples 
and 32 RBIs. Tagliaferri and senior second baseman Pat DeBoer (.313, 17 RBIs), 
both three-year starters, anchor the infield. "We're really tough up the 
middle," Alvarado said. Junior catcher Lazaro Campos, who played sparingly last 
year, "will surprise some people," Alvarado said. Senior center fielder Shawn 
Madden (.403), another three-year player, had five home runs with three triples 
and 21 RBIs. Four pitchers from last season have graduated, leaving senior 
right-hander Mitch Cizek the probable No. 1 starter. Junior left-hander Denny 
Sharp (3-2, 2.78 with the junior varsity), who has a good curve ball, should 
earn a starting role. Sophomore right-hander Cody Beaumaster is a likely 
reliever. Senior Travis Bourne (.333) will play first base. Third baseman Mike 
Murray, another senior, batted .259 with 20 RBIs. Danny Gugler (.270) returns 
in right field. Senior Jason Campbell, who batted a team-high .390 for the 
junior varsity, is fighting for an outfield position. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: No doubt the Golden Cougars can hit. "We have quite an offensive 
attack," said Alvarado, a former assistant at San Fernando. "We've been beating 
the hell out of people, offensively." The same fate may be in store for Kennedy 
if no proven pitchers emerge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
San Fernando 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Steve Marden, 11th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 14-7; second in league at 11-4 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: After three consecutive 11-4 league finishes, San Fernando 
again fields a strong contender for a championship. But after advancing to the 
City final last season, a league title is insufficient. "Last year our goal was 
to make it to Dodger Stadium," Marden said. "We did that. Now winning at Dodger 
Stadium is the goal." The Tigers have the tools to make a return trip. Senior 
right-hander Frank Serna (3-1, 2.78 ERA in league play) returns along with 
junior left-hander Hector De La Cruz (4-0, 1.66 ERA in league play) and 
three-year letterman Rudy Sanchez (three doubles, 11 RBIs), an all-league 
catcher. "If I'm starting a team, I know I'd like to have an ace righty, your 
best lefty and an all-league catcher back," Marden said. "And we got that." 
Five position players also return, led by all-league second baseman Richard 
Ortiz (.454, 11 RBIs) and late-season standout Bobby Corrales (.371, 13 RBIs), 
who helped beat Chatsworth in the City semifinals with a home run. Corrales 
will move from third to short. "He has as good a hands as any shortstop we've 
had in a long time," Marden said. Outfielder Jesse Romero (.294) is also back 
and will start in center. Junior John Najar, who played as a reserve as a 
sophomore, is possibly San Fernando's best power hitter. Richard Avalos, an 
all-league player for the junior varsity, will start at third. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Take a team to the City final and its appetite is whetted. Marden said 
the Tigers are hungry for another trip to Dodger Stadium. "We are very well 
motivated this season," he said. "To come so close, and to have so many 
returning players, we want another shot. We don't think the better team won 
last year." If Serna and De La Cruz come through as they did last season, 
another chance is very possible.

WEST VALLEY LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Canoga Park 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Jim Smith, first season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 13-8; second in league at 10-5 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Only two years after capturing the City Section 4-A Division 
championship, the Hunters appear far from winning it this season. Only two 
players return from last year's team that reached the semifinals before losing 
to eventual champion Monroe. Senior right-hander Jason Mitchell, who pitched 
only 1 2/3 innings last year, is the probable No. 1 starter. Mitchell also will 
play third base in place of Del Marine, who transferred to El Camino Real. 
Senior right-hander Mike Moses, who played sparingly last year, is the No. 2 
starter. The remaining players are all new to the varsity. Junior Michael 
Bruce, who was ineligible last year, has a good arm and will play atcatcher. 
Senior left-hander Mark Ferris, who is recovering from a groin injury suffered 
during soccer season, will pitch and play first base. Senior Mike Tanis and 
junior Doug Kreider are battling for the second base job. Junior Freddy 
Gellogos is the shortstop. Other newcomers include senior Brad Hodge, an 
infielder, and outfielders Terry Smith, a senior, and Mike Lewis, a junior. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: New coach, new players. "We haven't got too much varsity experience," 
Smith said. "If our pitching comes around, we'll be competitive." Canoga Park 
lost a leader in Marine, as well as four home runs and 16 RBIs. Could be a long 
season in a tough league. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Bob Lofrano, 10th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 25-2; first in league at 15-0 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: So what if the Chancellors lost eight starters to graduation? 
Chatsworth's junior varsity last year posted its eighth consecutive league 
title and five key players return from the powerhouse varsity. Senior 
relief-pitcher-turned-starter Derek Wallace (7-0, eight saves, 1.33 ERA), who 
has made a verbal commitment to attend Pepperdine, might be the best pitcher in 
the City. Junior right-hander Reed McMackin (2-0, 1.49) gives the Chancellors a 
solid rotation. Senior switch-hitter Jason Evans, a transfer from Loyola, will 
double as the shortstop and top reliever. With several strong arms graduating 
from the junior varsity, "We can throw six kids," Lofrano said. Senior 
switch-hitting catcher Eric Johnson (6-3, 190) transferred from Michigan. 
Senior second baseman Vince Simili (.380, four doubles) quarterbacks a tight 
infield. "He does a lot of things right," Lofrano said. Senior third baseman 
Rich Aude (6-5, 185) batted just .272 last year but is much improved, Lofrano 
said. Senior Kevin Chong (.324) is the only returning outfielder. Seniors Ron 
Niemi, Chris Husted and Nick Schultz, and juniors Mike Mancuso and Rodney Bloom 
-- all up from the junior varsity -- will compete for outfield positions. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "I think we're going to be very strong offensively," Lofrano said. 
"Last year, we would win games, 5-2, 5-1. This year, we've pretty much been 
hitting the heck out of the ball." The pitching is solid. The hitting is, too. 
Don't expect many Chatsworth losing streaks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Mike Maio, sixth season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 9-11; third in league at 6-9 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Junior Ryan McGuire, Cal-Hi Sports' sophomore Player of the 
Year last season, might emerge as the top offensive threat in the conference. 
McGuire, a left-handed batter who moves from third base to first, batted .397 
with eight extra-base hits and 14 RBIs. "The main thing about him is his 
hustle," Maio said. Senior Del Marine, a transfer from Canoga Park who batted 
.370, probably will play catcher. Marine hit four home runs while playing home 
games at Lanark Park, a field with no outfield fence. That number should 
increase in El Camino Real's cozy confines. Junior right-hander Patrick Treend 
(3-1, 5.76), who had a team-high 30 strikeouts, is the No. 1 starter. Senior 
Steve Smith (.300, two home runs) will pitch and play outfield. Senior Donny 
Chelius, a reserve outfielder last year, will start. Senior Paul Geller (.240) 
and sophomore Greg Sharen will play second base and shortstop. Marine might 
play third base, a position he held at Canoga Park, leaving junior Bobby Kim 
(.305, 12 RBIs) to return at catcher. Kim can also play outfield. Junior Jason 
Cohen (.233) will be the designated-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: The Conquistadores, as the saying goes, were a better team than their 
record indicated last year. "If that's true," Maio said, "I have to do a better 
job coaching." Lack of a proven relief pitcher is El Camino Real's only 
apparent weakness. But if McGuire and Marine hit consistently, the 
Conquistadores won't need to nail down many late-inning leads. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taft 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Rich McKeon, second season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 9-15; fifth in league at 5-10 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: McKeon supervised a predominantly junior team last season, 
hoping a squad of seasoned seniors would emerge. Presto! Eight players and a 
pitcher return, seven of them seniors. Their collective batting average, 
however, was only .298 and four batted less than .230. "But we're going to have 
a good lineup," McKeon said. Pitching, however, is a question mark. Senior 
right-handers Chris Brown (3-4, 4.31), a returning starter, and Scott Tiano, 
who was 0-5 in 27 1/3 innings, will form the starting rotation. Junior 
shortstop Benji Belfield, the team's best player according to McKeon, will bat 
third and be used as a reliever. Outfielder Glenn Nahmias batted .406 with 21 
RBIs and seven doubles, all team highs. Senior first baseman Doug Kougher 
missed last season because of shoulder surgery. Adam Zutler (6-2, 225, .386), 
who moves from first base to catcher, has excellent power. Jason Shapiro, a 
three-year starter, batted .359 with a team-high four home runs. Seniors Mike 
Kimelman (.344), Richie Shapiro (.179) and Rich Cosentino (.228) will compete 
for the remaining infield positions. Junior Brett Reisner, another returning 
player, and seniors Greg Peck and Geoff Ruch will compete for an outfield 
position. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: With more good fielders than positions to fill, "a little bit of 
competition is going to be good for us," McKeon said. Though long on fielders, 
Taft is short on pitching. Anyone know how to throw a curve? "Pitching depth is 
a weakness," McKeon said. "We can't have any injuries or we're going to be in 
trouble. But we expect to have a great year. We really do."

<P>
COACH: Tom Lucero, 13th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 12-11; tied for third in league at 10-8 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: For all-around talent, senior right-hander Javier Delahoya 
might be the best in the area. He certainly seems to be a player to watch. "We 
scrimmaged Westchester a couple of weeks ago and there were 15 scouts out to 
see him," Lucero said. If they were not impressed with his arm -- he had 101 
strikeouts in 69 innings en route to a 13-9 mark and 2.54 ERA last season -- 
they are sure to like his bat. Delahoya, who will start at third base when he 
is not pitching, will bat third. Last year he hit .403 with six home runs, 
three triples and 27 RBIs. Grant has veterans at other positions as well. Among 
the returning starters are Jim Tumbeiro at shortstop, fourth-place hitter 
Manual Toledo at catcher, Jeff Boado in left field and Sean Goldman, who 
returns in center and will bat second. All are seniors. "We're very set at our 
first five or six positions," Lucero said. Delahoya will have support on the 
mound. Senior left-hander Jason Parker, who started last year and was 3-6, is 
one likely starter. But Lucero said he will not hesitate to use relievers Hugo 
Valenzuela and Cody Williams, a pair of capable right-handers. "They may be 
calling me Captain Hook," Lucero said. "If the starter doesn't have it, he'll 
be out of there." 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Lucero said the Lancers have the best talent since they won the City 
title three years ago. "We've certainly got our best pitching since 1986," he 
said. "We've got a stopper in Delahoya and several others who can do the job 
behind him -- it looks pretty good." If Lucero can fill a few holes, Grant is a 
legitimate challenger for the league title.

<P>
COACH: Brian York, fifth season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 10-13; tied for third in league at 10-8 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: York confidently predicts that the Huskies will finish last. 
He says it with an air of certainty. And because six of his starters are 
academically ineligible, it's hard to argue with him. "We're decimated," says 
York, who called up seven sophomores to round out the roster. "We lost a lot." 
Included among the missing are all-league selections Duane Braxton (.388) and 
Bennie Valdez (6-4, 3.11 ERA), who at best are ineligible until after the 
spring break -- by which time the team will have played eight conference games. 
The Huskies' three top pitchers are gone, so it will mean some ad-libbing for 
York on the bench. "It'll be like Little League," York said. "An inning from 
the second baseman, one from the shortstop, that type of thing." York's best 
eligible players are Russell Greene, a three-year letterman and All-City 
linebacker who will play at first base and right field. Greene batted .367 last 
year. Erik Martinez (.323), who started at short last year as a sophomore, also 
returns. Craig White and Matt Farmer, a pair of inexperienced sophomore 
right-handers, will probably be the starting pitchers. The news isn't all bad: 
Mike Lewis, another sophomore, will play at third. "One day he'll be among the 
finest players in the Valley," said York, a one-time scout for the White Sox, 
A's and Phillies. "He's a terrific athlete. And even better, he's eligible." 
OUTLOOK: As if losing several players wasn't bad enough, the Huskies will soon 
lose their coach, who will have surgery on an ankle he injured in November. 
"We're hurting. We're a crippled program with a crippled coach," York cracked. 
And releaguing did not help the Huskies' chances any. "They took away Hollywood 
and Verdugo Hills and that usually meant three wins apiece right there," he 
said. "It will be a long year."

Poly 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Jerry Cord, 14th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 19-3; first in league at 17-1 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: For two seasons, Cord's pitching rotation was set with Greg 
Nealon and Nick Lymberopoulos. But they're gone now so this season, not 
surprisingly, the Parrots' main question mark centers on pitching. Last year's 
No. 3 pitcher, right-hander Mario Gomez, returns after posting a 3-0 mark in a 
league championship season. But Gomez, who was effective during summer American 
Legion play, must improve on last season's 6.10 ERA. Right-hander David Giatti, 
the junior varsity MVP, will be the No. 2 starter and right-hander Eddie Chavez 
and left-hander Eddie Castellanos are the bullpen options. "Our pitching is 
unproven," Cord said. "We'll have to see how fast they adapt out there." 
Three-fifths of the infield is back. Harold Whiteside, a three-year letterman 
who played in the outfield last year and batted .348, will catch after serving 
as a back-up catcher on Poly's 1987 City finalist and playing in the outfield 
last year. Adulfo Hernandez (seven steals) returns at second and Gabe Chavez 
moves from third to short. Chavez (.327, 16 RBIs), who also had a fine American 
Legion season, and Shad Martinez return in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: After winning the league title two years running, Poly is again a 
favorite to make the playoffs. Duplicating last season's success might be hard, 
however. "We'll be very adequate defensively and we're capable of hitting the 
ball," Cord said. "If we can get the pitching to be consistent, we'll be in 
good shape." If not, the Parrots, who appear to lack the long ball, will have 
to scratch and claw to score runs. 
</P>

<P>
Sylmar 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Gary Donatella, first season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 12-10; second in league at 11-7 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Donatella returns to his alma mater after several successful 
seasons at Marshall. Donatella coached the Sylmar junior varsity in 1978 and 
1979, so he knows the area and he knows the competition. Fortunately for him, 
so do several of his players. The Spartans have five returning starters and one 
of the area's best pitchers in senior right-hander Nino Romo (8-5, 2.77 ERA). 
Romo is one of the wiliest pitchers in the City, and he baffles hitters with an 
assortment of pitches in the strike zone -- as exhibited by a strikeout-to-walk 
ratio of 2-1. Tom Ball, a left-hander who saw limited action last year, is 
expected to be the No. 2 starter. "He had a heckuva winter," Donatella said. 
"He's really progressed." Either Romo or Ball will play first base when the 
other is pitching. Catcher Bruce Gomez (.319, 16 RBIs) is back to handle the 
pitchers. Jose Gallegos (.342) moves from second to short and will bat cleanup, 
and Joe Contreraz (.261, 10 steals) moves from first to third. Brad McGahan 
(.377, seven doubles, nine steals, nine RBIs) returns to anchor the outfield in 
center and bat third. "Brad has good range, a good arm, a good bat and decent 
speed," Donatella said. The verdict? "He's a very good ballplayer." Sylmar 
looks thin in relief pitching, with junior Danny Garcia and sophomore James 
Encinas backing up Romo and Ball. Youth may be served in other ways, however. 
Sophomores Dereck Ornelas and Robert Garcia are both battling for starting 
slots. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Donatella insists that defense will be the key of his team's success, 
something former Coach John Klitsner (now at Mission College) told him was 
spotty last year. "John said they had a tendency to throw the ball away at 
times," Donatella. "We have taken care of that. I really emphasize defense, and 
we have really improved." If Romo and Ball hold up, Sylmar has the senior 
leadership to challenge for a playoff berth, if not a league title. "If we get 
any kind of pitching, I think we'll be right there," Donatella said.

MID-VALLEY LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Birmingham 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Wayne Sink, 12th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 6-12; tied for fourth in league, 5-10 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The Braves have only four seniors and two -- catcher Diego 
Arcos (6-0, 175) and first baseman Ernesto Alvarez (6-1, 170) -- are exchange 
students from Ecuador. "They're super kids and good workers," Sink said. 
Right-hander David Grisar (2-5, 4.09 earned-run average), who throws an 
assortment of pitches, is the only returning pitcher. Left fielder Brian Barry 
is the fourth senior. Junior center fielder Danny Larson (.342, two doubles), a 
three-sport athlete, has improved power, Sink said, and sophomore catcher Seth 
Rosenzweig batted a team-high .414 for the junior varsity. Second baseman 
Justin Bass, a returning starter, and shortstop Ruben Flores, are both 5-foot-7 
juniors. "They're kind of the Billy Barty boys up the middle," Sink said. 
Junior Matt Mowry (third base) and sophomore Mike Belasco (first base) leave 
the Braves inexperienced at the corners. Junior Josh Brown will either start or 
be the top reliever while another pitcher, sophomore left-hander Jason 
Mansfield, will rely on a split-finger fastball. Junior Bob Bookatz, up from 
the junior varsity, will start in right field. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Sink must contend with a roster that numbers only 14, but he is 
ecstatic about the prospect of leaving the Mid-Valley League. "I'm tickled to 
death at getting away from Granada Hills, Kennedy and San Fernando," he said. 
"We're sitting here looking pretty even." Sink concedes, however, that the 
Braves are "an average ballclub" as the season begins. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Monroe 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Kevin Campbell, fourth season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 13-16; fourth in league at 5-10 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: For Sean Henson and Tim Costic, 1988 was the kind of season 
every player dreams of having as a senior. Henson, a left-hander, pitched a 
five-hitter in Monroe's 3-2 win over San Fernando in the City Section 4-A 
championship game, striking out 10. Costic finished with a .426 batting 
average, 11 doubles, six triples, five home runs, 37 runs batted in and Times' 
Valley Player of the Year honors. Yet neither was a senior. Costic was a junior 
and Henson a sophomore, and now both must try to duplicate -- or improve upon 
-- last year's improbable feats. Early signs are not positive. In winter-league 
play, both Costic (back) and Henson (elbow) suffered injuries, although both 
will be ready for the regular season, Campbell said. Henson and Costic will 
lead the team offensively and defensively -- one will play at first base when 
the other is on the mound. Henson (4-4, 4.02 ERA), Costic (3-2, 2.75 ERA) and 
senior right-hander Henry Valdez (3-2, 4.57 ERA) form the core of the mound 
corps. "Our strength is going to be pitching," Campbell said. "We'll build 
around that until the offense gets there." Senior catcher Adam Clark (19 RBIs), 
infielder Mike Enriquez (.260), outfielder Ernesto Echeveste (.368 in 19 
at-bats) and junior shortstop John Langley -- all returning starters -- likely 
will play pivotal roles if the offense takes off. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Campbell admits that Monroe will be hard-pressed to mirror last year's 
success. "We're not going to blow many people away offensively," Campbell said. 
And if that means playing little ball, so be it, he says. "We'll put the ball 
on the ground and make people react to that." Yet if Monroe makes it through 
the league season, and if the offense finally jells. . . . As 1988 showed, 
anything is possible in a single-elimination playoff format. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reseda 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Mike Stone, 10th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 7-12; sixth in league at 4-11 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Reseda lost several key players from last year's team, which 
finished last in the highly competitive West Valley League. Outfielder Kevin 
Ogle (.421, seven home runs, 25 RBIs) is now playing at Cal State Northridge, 
right-hander Steve Brody (6-5, 3.79 ERA) is playing at Arizona State and Damon 
Lantz (10 RBIs) and Mike Shwartzer (.370) are playing at Pierce. But the 
Regents have their entire infield back. Twins Ron and Rod Stricklin, seniors 
and three-year lettermen, will start at first and short, respectively. Rod hit 
.272 with six steals and Ron hit .306 with six doubles and six steals last 
year. Eric Perry, "our best hitter for average," Stone says, will play at 
second after batting .400 with six steals last season. Joey Arnold will be the 
designated-hitter and chief utility man. Darin McGrath and Mark McLain, a pair 
of junior right-handers, will be the starting pitchers. McLain is a transfer 
from Pomona and McGrath pitched for the junior varsity last year. McGrath will 
start in center when McLain is pitching. Sophomore Louis Vanacore, brother of 
1987 graduate Mike, will play in the outfield. Junior Joey Tushnet, the league 
player of the year for the B football team, will play somewhere. "He's an 
excellent hitter," Stone said. "I'll find a place to play him." 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: As usual, the Regents will have few problems scoring. But also, as 
usual, pitching will be the focal point. "It's our main problem," Stone said. 
"If we can get a couple of guys to do the job, we'll be competitive. Other than 
that, I'm not going out any further on a limb. We'll show up 17 times, I can 
guarantee that." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Van Nuys 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Kenji Mochizuki, fourth season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 5-19; sixth in league at 1-14 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Two key offensive players return, both needing to deliver 
improved performances if the Wolves are to improve upon last year. Senior 
pitcher-center fielder Melvin Baltrez batted .288 -- third highest on the team 
-- with three doubles. Baltrez will bat second or third and serve as the No. 1 
starter on the mound. Senior catcher Keith Quigley had a team-high five RBIs 
last year. "He'll supply us with offense," Mochizuki said. Shortstop Mike 
Engler, who batted just .200 last year, will bat third. Senior first baseman 
Richard Hanna also returns. All of the above are three-year varsity players. 
Senior Elton Teng will return as a starting pitcher and junior right-hander 
Lorenzo Morales as the top reliever. Senior John House returns in right field. 
Senior outfielder Kevin Gilbert, who batted a team-high .325 last year, is the 
best of several junior varsity players joining the varsity. Senior outfielder 
Carlos Bejines is another newcomer. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: This year marks an anniversary of sorts: Van Nuys has not won a City 
championship since 1959. The 30-year drought is likely to continue unless 
several players perform well beyond their capabilities. "I think we should do a 
little better in this new league," Mochizuki said.

NORTHEAST CONFERENCE 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Verdugo Hills 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Curt Yarrington, third season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 6-15; sixth in league at 6-12 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: For Masaaki Yamashita, playing at Verdugo Hills has become a 
have-visa-will-travel prospect. Yamashita, an exchange student from Japan, 
first attended Verdugo Hills as a sophomore. "Then he came back last year," 
Yarrington said. "And then he showed up again this year." It seems Yamashita 
was told that if he wants to attend college in Japan, he must now graduate from 
Verdugo Hills. Under any circumstance, Yarrington is glad to have him. 
Yamashita will be in the pitching rotation and play third base. Luis Rodriguez, 
a senior right-hander who started at third last year, is another probable 
starter. Verdugo Hills, which plays in the Northeast Conference, also has the 
services of Ryan Paskwietz and Jamie Valentine, both returning infield 
starters. Paskwietz will play second or shortstop, and Valentine will share 
time at shortstop and pitch in relief. Bob Yerby (.275), who also returns, will 
start in center field and bat third. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: If Verdugo Hills is to make the playoffs, the key lies in beating 
opponents from the other side of the conference -- Hollywood, Marshall, Belmont 
and Lincoln. "We've got to basically sweep the other side," Yarrington said. 
"We're probably the third-best team in our league." The Dons need to improve in 
many areas but primarily on defense. "We've got a long way to go defensively," 
he said. "That may determine a large part of how well we do."

Camarillo 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Ken Wagner, eighth season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 12-14-1; fourth in league at 5-7 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The Scorpions have the deepest pitching staff in the league. 
Five pitchers, including Steve Biggs, a returning all-league right-hander who 
was 7-4 with a 3.74 ERA, make Camarillo a legitimate contender for the league 
title. "You never have enough pitching," Wagner said. "But we're fortunate to 
have five guys coming back who throw hard." Right-handers Matt Tackett, Eric 
Raba and Vaughn Wechsberg and left-hander Charlie Constantine give Wagner 
plenty of options. Catcher Chris Johnson (.365) will provide power on offense, 
as will Tackett, who will play first base when not pitching. Brothers A.J. and 
Mark Lindbloom will play the outfield. The rest of the defense is not set. 
Aurelio Flores, who is recovering from knee surgery, and sophomore Mike Muncy 
will battle at shortstop, as will Bill Lynch and Mitch King, a left-handed 
hitter, at second. At third, Johnny Barroso, Biggs and Flores will share time. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Wagner said that the Scorpions have the pitching and defense, along 
with the potential to hit well. "I'm pretty encouraged right now," he said, 
"especially with our pitching and defense. I think we can be right in the thick 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Don Cardinal, 23rd season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 10-14; fourth in league at 5-7 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Although it was rumored that John Johnson, Channel Islands' 
All-American running back, would not play baseball, it was news to Cardinal, 
who has moved Johnson from second base to shortstop. "He can hit the ball out 
any time this year," Cardinal said. Juniors Jimmy Davis and Mark Contreras will 
share catching duties and three players will share time at second base. Junior 
Richard Tetezano has won the first base job and Patrick Avila, a four-year 
varsity player, is at third. Sophomore Jacob Cruz, a second-team all-league 
player as a freshman, is back in center field, with senior Ben Castillo to his 
right and Manny Padilla to his left. Cruz likely will bat second behind 
Johnson. The pitching staff is untested. David Lucio, a senior left-hander, has 
the only varsity experience. Right-handers Padilla and George Alvarado are 
juniors, and John Bogges and Angel Aragon, a sophomore and freshman, 
respectively, are also right-handers. Aragon has perhaps the best arm. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: As usual, Channel Islands will hit well but pitching could be a 
problem early because of inexperience. "If we wanted to, we could probably 
start six or seven underclassmen," Cardinal said. "But I think offensively, 
we'll probably be pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Gary Fabricius, third season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 13-13; fourth in league at 5-7 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Jeremy Dewey and Tim Beal must pick up where Rob Teasdale and 
Jeff Berman, pitchers who threw nearly 95% of the Panthers' innings last 
season, left off. Especially in the pitching-rich Marmonte League. Dewey and 
Beal are senior right-handers. In the wings, juniors Jason Kernan, Andy Moffat 
and Matt LaBelle will fill in. All are right-handers. "We may be in some 
high-scoring games," Fabricius said. "But my pitchers are out to prove me 
wrong." One guy Fabricius would like to see on the mound occasionally is senior 
Wayne Cook, but he has signed a letter of intent to play quarterback for UCLA, 
The Bruins would prefer he not pitch, according to Fabricius. Cook, a 
first-team all-league selection last season when he batted .337, will move from 
first base to center field and bat third. Junior Brian Smith and senior Geoff 
Black, a second-team all-league selection, will play left and right fields 
respectively. Black, a speedy No. 2 hitter, batted .301. In the infield, Jeff 
O'Brien, a left-handed hitter, will play first, Brad Cleveringa will play 
second and Eric Greene, an outfielder last season, will be the shortstop. 
Playing time at third base will be divided among three juniors, although Shane 
Gallimore appears to have the inside track. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Fabricius at first was concerned with what he called the "Charlie 
Brown things" the Panthers were doing. But the team played better in recent 
scrimmages and might be able to use its hitting as a security blanket. "We're 
definitely coming around from earlier," Fabricius said. "You don't make routine 
plays, you're going to get buried. We should be competitive, but how 
competitive I don't know." 
</P>

Royal 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Mike McCurdy, fourth season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 10-15; seventh in league at 2-10 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The Highlanders have only five seniors on their 17-man roster 
and just one senior pitcher, so success will depend on the maturation of the 
underclassmen. Senior James Jones, a starter in left field last season, will be 
counted on to pitch extensively. Left-hander Bill Egan has the staff's best 
velocity, and McCurdy also will turn to right-handers Shane Hendrixson, Gilbert 
Renteria, Tim Delmonte and Jim Tosh. Senior Ron Bauer and sophomore Steve 
Talafuse will handle the young pitching staff at catcher. Egan also will play 
first base and Sean Swearinger, Dennis Gildehause, Richard Naranjo and Sean 
Mitchell, a transfer from Newbury Park, will fill in around the infield. 
Naranjo, a sophomore, likely will bat cleanup. When not pitching, James Jones 
will play left field. Jason Jones, who hit .333 overall but had a .404 average 
and all six of his home runs in league games, will be in center field. Jason 
Jones also had six doubles, 16 RBIs and 11 stolen bases. Junior Robert Campos 
will be in right field. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "We're awfully young," McCurdy said. "But if our pitchers can keep us 
in games, I think we have a chance to surprise some people." McCurdy thinks the 
league is becoming more oriented toward speed and defense, and his team has 
taken a turn in that direction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Mike Scyphers, 11th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 23-6; first in league at 10-2 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Simi Valley lost Scott Sharts and his Southern Section-record 
32 career home runs to the University of Miami, but the Pioneers are unlikely 
to face a power shortage in their quest for a fourth consecutive league title. 
"We don't have the one guy like Scott, but up and down the lineup we've got 
guys capable of hitting three to five home runs," Scyphers said. He expects 
even more from Jeff Sommer and Terry Hill, who will bat Nos. 3 and 4 in the 
order. Sommer, a right fielder, set a school record for sophomores last season 
with seven home runs and also batted .370. Hill, an all-league third baseman, 
batted .299 with five home runs and hit two in a scrimmage against Rio Mesa 
last weekend. Second baseman Jesse Anguiano hit three home runs last season and 
will move to the leadoff spot. Kenny Hood, a junior up from the junior varsity, 
will supply power at first base. Senior Andy Hodgins will play shortstop and 
Chadd Johnson will do the catching. Scyphers claims that the strength of the 
team lies with a pitching corps that is three deep. Senior Rich Langford has 10 
varsity wins in two years and senior Mike Jenkins was 4-0 with a 2.80 ERA last 
season. Hood, a 6-4 left-hander, prompts Scyphers to call this group his 
strongest rotation in 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Scyphers has a 198-66 record in 10 seasons and is shooting for an 
unprecedented fourth consecutive league title. The Pioneers are ranked seventh 
in the Southern Section's preseason Division 5-A poll and enter the season as 
the league favorite. "It's our title to lose," he said. "Somebody has to come 
take it away from us and I hope it won't be easy." 
</P>

<P>
Thousand Oaks 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Jim Hansen, 15th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 17-7-1; second in league at 9-3 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The Lancers didn't get 48 hours into their season before 
losing two of their three best pitchers. Scott Barkman, a junior left-hander 
and the No. 2 starter, tore ligaments in his ankle Monday and could be out 
three weeks. On Tuesday, Jim Diehl, the center fielder and No. 3 pitcher, tore 
ligaments in his left thumb and might miss the season. That puts more pressure 
on John Bushart, the Lancers' senior left-hander who was 6-2 and All-League 
last season. "If he has a good year he should get drafted or have an excellent 
opportunity at some colleges," Hansen said. "He is definitely expected to carry 
the load for us." In the meantime, seniors Chris Grodell and Brian Higgins and 
junior Brent Christenson will have to pick up some of the pitching slack. 
Defensively, Scott Haffner is at first base, David Kuenstle at second, Todd 
Lang at shortstop and Brian Higgins at third. Junior Lance Martin, who has 
spent parts of the past two seasons on the varsity, Christensen and Grodell 
appear to have won outfield positions. Senior Judd Schlimgen will catch. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: The injuries might take their toll, especially in the early part of 
the season. Defense -- a Lancer weakness last season -- is a concern of 
Hansen's. "If the kids come together and can play with confidence, we can play 
with anybody," he said. "We're going to work very hard at playing sound 
defense. If we make a lot of errors it's going to unravel some of our plans." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Westlake 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Rich Herrera, first season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 15-11; third in league at 6-6 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Herrera inherited a young team rich at nearly every position. 
Nowhere is that more evident than in the outfield where seven players will see 
time until Herrera settles on a regular threesome, if he does at all. Seniors 
Bryan Lubash, a left-handed hitter, and Shayne Kline, and juniors Sean Howard, 
Keenan McAluney and Matt McHenry are in the plans. Still, the Warriors' best 
players appear to be up the middle, especially at catcher and shortstop. Derek 
Tamburro (.309, six doubles, three home runs, 20 RBIs) is an adept defensive 
backstop who probably will bat cleanup. At shortstop, Mike Lieberthal returns 
from an impressive sophomore season in which he batted .320 and hit three 
homers. Pairing with Lieberthal on the double play will be junior Tim Falsken. 
Chuck Foster, a senior who hit .361 last season, is at third base and J.R. 
Johnson and Steve Susco likely will split time at first. Along with being a 
good offensive team, the Warriors could have the pitching staff to challenge 
Camarillo and Simi Valley. Left-hander Mike Eby (6-3, 2.97), a junior with 
three effective pitches, could be dominant. "He's going to be our guy," Herrera 
said. Eby is joined by seniors John Brookman (three saves) and John Wandzilak, 
both right-handers, and junior right-hander Scott Lerner, the junior varsity 
ace last season. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Westlake should challenge for the league title, especially if the 
pitching is as strong as it appears. "I think Simi Valley is going to have a 
tough team like they normally do and Camarillo will be good," Herrera said. 
"We'll need timely pitching and timely hitting, and I don't mean separately. I 
mean at the same time."

DEL REY LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crespi 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Scott Muckey, third season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 17-11; tied for first in league at 8-4 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The most pressing problem Muckey faces is finding a way to 
make opposing pitchers throw to John Dempsey. John, the son of Dodger catcher 
Rick Dempsey and a catcher himself, hit .430 last season with nine doubles and 
25 RBIs. A line-drive hitter, Dempsey needs a formidable hitter behind him. The 
leading candidates are seniors Chad Nichols, Chris Romero and Don Calabria 
(.324, 15 RBIs). Nichols, probably the Celts' best pitcher, batted .380 with 21 
RBIs. When he isn't pitching, Nichols (4-6, 3.94 ERA) will play the outfield. 
Romero is expected to start at third base and Calabria will be an outfielder. 
Regardless of where they fit in, the foursome's presence will give Crespi punch 
in the middle. Left-hander Mark Kurtz will join Nichols on the pitching staff 
and Dempsey will be used primarily in short relief. Contending for starting 
positions are Kurtz and junior Scott Barton at first base, junior Pat Bennett 
at second, junior Mark Maurizi at shortstop and seniors Andy MacDonald and Mark 
D'Antonio in the outfield. "I think there's probably a little bit of balance in 
the lineup," Muckey said. "We're going to play the game fairly well and 
understand the game fairly well." 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "I think we're going to be tough to beat," Muckey said. "But I don't 
think we're going to blow anybody out. There will be a lot of close games." In 
successive seasons, Crespi has struggled early before rallying to win at least 
a share of the league title. The Celts tied for the championship last season 
with Notre Dame, which has since departed for the San Fernando Valley League. 
"It looks like a five-team race," Muckey said. "All the teams seem to be fairly 
strong." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alemany 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Jim Ozella, sixth season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 15-11; fourth in league at 6-6 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: A couple of weeks ago, Joey Rosselli would have been tops in 
this category. But the junior left-hander broke his pitching hand in a fall in 
his home and broke Ozella's heart in the process. "That's not bad news, that's 
real bad news," Ozella said. "With Joey, I think we can win it. Before his 
injury, he raised his level. He was throwing bullets. We're talking pro 
material here." In Rosselli's place, senior right-handers Damon Paikos, Tom 
Daniels and John Lite will have to pick up a few extra innings of work. 
Defensively, Mike Sims returns at catcher, as does Jon Beauchemin at third. 
Sims hit .324 last season and Beauchemin had a good winter after struggling at 
the plate last year. Lite (.377, 17 RBIs) is learning to play second so Ozella 
can get his bat in the lineup when Lite isn't pitching. Three different Indians 
could eventually start at shortstop. Brian Swanson and Leo Tjada are fighting 
for first base and Ray Cano, Jeff Ordona and Daniels will play the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Bosco Tech has left for the Camino Real League, leaving the Del Rey 
with five teams. Under a new format, Del Rey teams will play one another three 
times. "The key now is to win the league series," Ozella said. "Sweep people 
and you start to run away with it." If Alemany can weather Rosselli's absence, 
it has a chance to challenge. "I think we're going to score some runs," Ozella 
said. "Even if Joey's not around, we're still going to score some runs." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
St. Francis 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Tom Moran, first season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 5-12; fifth in league at 4-8 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: After assisting for six seasons, Moran takes over a program 
in need of direction. The Golden Knights should be strong up the middle with 
returning first-team all-leaguers Gregg Zaun at catcher and Mark Loretta, who 
is moving from second base to shortstop. Zaun, who Moran calls, "a Division I 
prospect," batted .410 and has the potential to hit with power. Loretta, a 
three-year starter, hit .405 in league and is being recruited by Stanford and 
Notre Dame. In center field, junior Matt Jones is a returning starter. Zaun, a 
nephew of Rick Dempsey, will be counted on to handle a pitching staff that 
needs to perform well. Erik Hagge (1-3 in league) is a returning starter and 
senior Mike Weisenberg was used primarily in relief last season. Also on the 
staff, juniors Mitch Bowen and Manny Fernandez have been promoted from the 
junior varsity. "We really need them to step forward and take charge for us to 
have any chance at all," Moran said. The starter at second base has yet to be 
found, but Derek Bedell is back at first base, and Bowen and John Knighton are 
at third. In the outfield, Scott Enriquez, a part-time starter last season, has 
returned to right. Left field is unsettled. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Moran mentioned Crespi, on the basis of consecutive league titles, as 
a favorite, but not a lock. "The Del Rey League is wide open," he said. "I 
don't perceive that anybody will come in and take command of the league." For 
St. Francis to challenge, it will have to find consistent pitching. Said Moran: 
"I think all the kids have the potential to play at this level."

<P>
COACH: Rich Duran, third season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 18-6-1; first in league at 11-2-1 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Dmitri Young returns after one of the finest freshman seasons 
the Valley-area observers have ever seen. Young, who will play third base, 
batted .420 (37 for 88), scored 21 runs and had six doubles, three triples, 
seven home runs and 29 runs batted in. Young, just 15 years old, is also the 
quickest Spartan, said Duran, who plans to run his team more than in the past. 
"He has all the tools," Duran said of Young. "We've timed him in 4.1 seconds to 
first, from the right side. He is so gifted." Young will bat third in the 
lineup, ahead of Steve Soliz, who batted .355 last season. Soliz is also a 
talented defensive catcher. "This year, I don't think anyone's going to pitch 
to Dmitri," Duran said. "I know I wouldn't." Defensively, Carlos Rios is at 
first base, David Frazier (.320) is at second, Shea Freeman at shortstop, and 
Daric Dicus, Tom Deardorf and Carlos Cendejas are in the outfield. Somewhere 
among his pitchers, Duran will have to find an extra 12 wins, which Bobby Ayala 
took with him when he graduated. Anthony Espinoza, a senior left-hander, and 
Jon Rust, a senior right-hander, appear to be the best bets. Espinoza, however, 
has experienced arm problems and might not be available for several weeks. 
Right-handers David Soliz, Henry Wilson and Frank Tinoco will need to fill in. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Buena and Dos Pueblos appear to have the most talent returning and 
will be the biggest challenges in the Spartans' quest to repeat. "I think down 
the road, our offense might be one of our strengths," Duran said. "And we have 
more team speed. We have four or five guys who can run real well." Rio Mesa's 
pitching, however, will have to come around. "Last year it was our strength," 
Duran said. "This year it's a question mark."

<P>
Crescenta Valley 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Tony Zarrillo, first season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 10-13; fifth in league at 5-10 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: To hear Zarrillo tell it, if Crescenta Valley's pitching 
falls in line, the Falcons' time has come. But shaping up the team's pitching 
staff is no fait accompli. Zarrillo has lost starters Trey Pogue and Dominic 
Gonzalez so Scott Gleason, a shortstop who was used sparingly on the mound last 
season, will be called on more often. Gleason is a control pitcher and Zarrillo 
says his fastball is "good but not blazing." Junior pitcher Eric Berger moves 
up from the JV team to help and first baseman Shane Cowsill, who hit .390 with 
39 RBIs last season, will also pitch. Hyok Chang, who played quarterback on the 
football team, will move from catcher to second base. Mike Johnson will play 
shortstop and Dan Sanchez, a part-time starter last year, will play third. 
Utility infielder Ernie Diaz might have the best hands on the team and Zarrillo 
hopes to groom him for the second base job. Victor Ramirez, a two-year starter, 
returns in center field, David Bayles returns in right and Mike Starkey, who 
was the left fielder and designated hitter last season, completes the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: The Falcons return some good players but they might find wins 
difficult to come by unless their green pitching staff can find the strike 
zone. "We'll only go as far as our pitching," Zarrillo said. "And that's our 
greatest area of inexperience." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Glendale 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Chris Axelgard, second season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 14-8; first in league at 12-3 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Axelgard, The Times' All-Glendale coach of the year last 
season, will have a tough time coming up with an encore thanks to graduation. 
"I walked into kind of an nice situation last year," Axelgard said, "(but) 
everybody loses players." Not everybody loses a pitcher like Bob Moser (6-3, 
1.28 ERA) and Jeff Sofro, who hit .397 in Pacific League play, though. Axelgard 
will look to all-league shortstop Swain Wukelich who led the Dynamiters with 28 
RBIs. Ian Somerville, used sparingly last season, will replace Sofro at third 
base. Junior John Strauss, who was slated to catch last year but was bumped 
after a bad case of the sophomore jitters, will get another chance. Danny Gray 
and Curtis Jung will vie for the starting job at first. Glendale returns its 
entire outfield, led by all-league player Brent Overfelt and including center 
fielder Felipe Perez and Marco Rivas. Axelgard hopes oft-injured pitcher Robert 
DeTolve can fill Moser's cleats. DeTolve played center on the basketball team 
but spent much of the season nursing an injured knee. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: The Glendale roster isn't deep and, according to Axelgard, "there 
isn't a left-hander in the whole school. . . This year I'll have to earn my 
money." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hoover 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Bob Cooper, 14th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 12-12; third in league at 8-7 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Cooper says David Berkey should fill the void left by the 
departure of Sean Regan, last season's standout pitcher who posted a 7-5 record 
and now pitches at College of the Canyons. "With him pitching I have no 
question mark," Cooper said of Berkey, who will split time at shortstop. "He 
probably throws as hard as Sean. Maybe even harder. He's got a live arm." 
Questions arise, however, with the rest of the inexperienced staff: Eric 
Asselin, Paul Derrick and Bryan Day. "They have got to prove they can play at 
this level," Cooper said. Berkey, who batted .431 last season and led the team 
in doubles (nine), home runs (three) and steals (11), has proved himself, as 
has first baseman Mickey Moreno, who hit .414 last season and had a team-high 
12 RBIs. Peter Kim returns for his third season at catcher and should 
contribute offensively. Junior Jose Robles will play third and Mike Regan, 
Sean's brother, will start at second. Reggie Marcado, Adam Wiggins and Asselin 
make up the outfield. Cooper's expectations are fairly modest. "They can hit it 
out of any park," he said. "But I don't expect them to hit it out too much. If 
they can hit two or three (home runs) that's big production. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Cooper says he is not sure about the team's ability to overcome 
adversity. "We could have a fairly good team but anything that happens to 
hinder the team will hinder our win-loss record," he said. But Cooper was 
impressed with the Tornadoes' 14-3 win over La Canada last Saturday. "We were 
in midseason form," he said.

<P>
Canyon 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Rich Montanio, second season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 5-15; fifth in league at 4-11 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Senior right-hander Sean Nichols, who was 3-4 with a 3.46 ERA 
last season, is the best of a battered pitching staff. Junior Don Moody (0-2, 
5.67) recently underwent surgery on his right shoulder and is likely to be out 
for six weeks. Senior Rod Baltau, the school's quarterback, decided to throw 
fastballs this spring. "He looked real good, he was around the plate," Montanio 
said. Baltau, however, broke his right thumb in practice and also is lost for 
six weeks. Junior righthander Ben Ely begins the season academically 
ineligible, but should be eligible next week, Montanio said. Three-year starter 
Jason Stanley, who moves from third base to first, batted .306 but had only 
five RBIs. Second baseman Tim Rorick (.300), another three-year starter, and 
senior third baseman Cory Byars, who batted .423 with a team-high three home 
runs and 16 RBIs, add to "a good-looking infield," Montanio said. Senior 
shortstop Chris Flecher is unproven. Center fielder Kevin Backes (six RBIs) is 
a returning starter. Senior Ric Gombos returns at catcher. Sophomores Chris 
Stark (left field) and Roy Djorklund (right field) have earned starting 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Wanted: One starting pitcher, righty or lefty. "We need to come up 
with another starter real quick," Montanio said. The Cowboys also need to 
replace the offensive output of Gary Morgan, who batted .508 with 13 doubles 
last year before graduating. "We'll be in the hunt for second or third place if 
we get the pitching," Montanio said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Saugus 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Doug Worley, 14th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 18-8; second in league at 11-4. 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Senior right-hander Roger Salkeld (6-foot-5, 210) might be 
the best high school pitcher in the state. Salkeld's career record: 17-7 with 
212 strikeouts in 151 2/3 innings. "He's going to be outstanding," Worley said. 
Sizable senior right-handers Glenn Terry (6-foot-3, 200), who was 1-0 last 
year, and Chad Keene (6-foot-4, 220) also throw hard. Senior left-hander Scott 
Warr (2-0, 2.39) is the probable No. 2 pitcher and will also start in left 
field. "We're pretty good on the mound, not just with Roger," Worley said. 
Junior power-hitting catcher J.B. Johnson (6-0, 210) will bat cleanup. "This 
kid's gonna be heard from," Worley said. Senior center fielder Darrell Davis, 
who runs from home to first in 3.9 seconds, stole a school-record 29 bases in 
32 attempts last year while batting .373 in the leadoff position. Senior second 
baseman Tom Burges has quick hands and junior Walter White "is the shortstop 
we've been waiting for," Worley said. Senior Trevor Rice replaces slugger Tom 
Dodson at third base. Senior first baseman George Lopata (.325, six doubles, 
three home runs) also returns. Twins Jeff and John Albert, both juniors, are 
battling for outfield postions. Returning senior Matt Tull will play right 
field. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: The Centurions committed 96 errors last season, so defensive 
improvement is a must. A lot will depend on the play of Rice and Walters, both 
newcomers to the left side of the infield. Saugus is pitching-rich, but Worley 
insists the Centurions are more than a Salkeld fastball. "I think we'll be at 
least a good team, maybe a real good team," he said. "We may do something 
special this year."

</P>
<P>
Hart 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Bud Murray, third season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 26-1; first in league at 15-0 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Although the Indians lost center fielder Joe DeShryver, who 
hit .470, and pitcher Chris Matkin (9-1), they return eight starters. 
All-Southern Section pitcher Jason Edwards (11-0) returns to head a staff which 
includes left-handers Andrew Lorraine and David Margraves and right-handed 
reliever Keith Halcovich, a sophomore. First baseman Ray Gardocki, who hit .376 
and had a team-high 38 RBIs, should make a big contribution to the already 
powerful offensive arsenal. All-league second baseman Darin Tsukashima (.321), 
who stole a team-high 13 bases, and catcher Casey Burrill (.392), who hit six 
home runs and had 30 RBIs are part of that arsenal. Murray says senior third 
baseman David Toledo is probably the team's most improved player. Center 
fielder Jay Sanford hit .367 and stole six bases in limited play last season 
and might be the fastest player. Junior Lance Migita hit .403 and will start in 
left. Right fielder Chris Vasquez is also solid. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Murray says the disappointment of last season's loss to Fullerton in 
the second round of the playoffs could aid this year's team. "I think it was a 
good lesson for us," Murray said. "We wanted to win the CIF championship and we 
weren't tough enough to get it done." Though he cannot point to a reason why 
there might be a letdown from last season, Murray isn't expecting a command 
performance. "We're not going to do what we did last year," he vowed. "That 
just doesn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Burbank 
</P>
<P>
COACH: John Downum and Ray Moore, first season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 7-16; fifth in league at 2-13 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Downum and Moore, who took over for Gabe Margve, will have a 
tough time rebuilding Burbank in the difficult Foothill League. They are, 
however, starting with a solid pitching staff led by left-handed senior Steve 
Trainor. Junior Brian Gordon, a defensive end on the football team, and Anthony 
Valento, the Bulldogs' quarterback, will also pitch. Kevin Kruse returns in 
center field and adds some bat strength, as does left fielder Jim Cafferty. 
When he's not pitching, Gordon will play right field. Sophomore William Rivera 
starts at shortstop and though Rivera has no varsity experience, Downum says he 
has potential. "He's not a great shortstop but he's got good lateral movement 
and great hands," Downum said. "He's just a workaholic." Even better hands 
belong to third baseman David Fabienke, who returns at the hot corner. Jess 
Richardson will probably start at second base and junior Steve Kelly will take 
over at catcher. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "It's not like a total reconstruction year for us," Downum said. "I 
know that we're not a last-place team. Really, I think we can contend for a 
playoff spot." Because of the Bulldogs' inexperience, however, other league 
coaches might disagree. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Burroughs 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Ed Knaggs, second seasons 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 7-16; fifth in league at 2-13 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Burroughs was hit hard by graduation, but the Indians do have 
five returning players and a strong pitching staff. Senior Brian Forth was 6-4 
with a 2.33 ERA last season. "We will not be totally out of games with our 
pitchers," Knaggs said. Chris Westbury will split time between the mound and 
third base and Knaggs calls southpaw Mitch Megas, "Our primary stud out of the 
pen." The team's best infielder is probably Mario Joy, who moved from second to 
shortstop. Joy, batted .318 last season, will have to fill the void left by E. 
J. Pape, now playing at Valley College, who led Burroughs with a .420 average, 
four home runs and 17 RBIs. Among those returning is center fielder Rob Arroyo, 
who will probably be the leadoff batter, and Tom Phillips, a catcher and 
outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "Our ballclub is not real strong," Knaggs said. "We're pretty much 
starting from scratch." Knaggs says if the pitching fares as well as he 
expects, his team's chances of making the playoffs are good but adds Hart 
should dominate league competition. "If I were sitting there in practice 
telling (the team) we are going to win league, I wouldn't be too up front," he 
said.

OPERATIC CLOWN HAS SERIOUS SIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bass-baritone Francois Loup sees comic opera as serious business. But, although 
the Swiss-born singer has made his musical mark as an adept basso buffo, he 
cannot help but absorb the societal second-class stigma that brands the 
comedian. 
</P>
<P>
"When I sing a comic role, I have to fight against the feeling that I am just a 
clown in life, because the comic part is often the mirror of somebody who was 
not successful in life, somebody society makes fun of," he said. "But, when I 
sing some serious role, I feel more important." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday at Civic Theatre, Loup will sing the title role of Donizetti's "Don 
Pasquale" in San Diego Opera's production of this classic opera buffa. His 
local debut two years ago in another typical comic role, Dr. Bartolo in 
Rossini's "Il Barbiere di Siviglia," brought him both critical acclaim and a 
return invitation to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
If operatic comic roles do not have the cachet of serious roles, they are still 
harder to bring off, according to Loup. 
</P>
<P>
"It is easy to make people cry -- I know, I do serious roles," he said. Before 
his arrival in San Diego last week, Loup had sung the role of Schigolch in 
Alban Berg's bleak Expressionist tragedy "Lulu." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm always surprised that just by opening my mouth and singing a serious role, 
I can reduce people to tears," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But to make people laugh is another thing. Loup compared his task as a comic 
singer to telling a joke to friends. They may laugh the first time, he noted, 
but, if you tell the joke again, there's usually no response. The trick in 
singing a comic role is to get the audience to laugh every time, even when they 
know what the joke or the comic situation is. 
</P>
<P>
In "Don Pasquale," among the last of Donizetti's 66 operas, the composer's wit 
and dramatic skills make the singers' task easier. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, when you have early 19th-Century music, even Bellini, you can foresee 
much of what is going to come," Loup said. "Donizetti, however, is much less 
predictable. When I revived the role of Don Pasquale, I had forgotten that we 
go from one surprise to the next, which keeps the opera alive for the 
listener." 
</P>
<P>
Politicians have given Loup unintentional models for his comic 
characterizations. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to watch political characters," he said. "When I sing, sometimes I take 
things from them, although someone like Francois Mitterrand is a bit too 
humorless to be much of a model." 
</P>
<P>
According to Loup, it is the politician's calculated sincerity that is the most 
applicable trait for the comic opera singer. 
</P>
<P>
"Politicians have to please the public," he said. "They cannot become too 
involved; they need some distance and a certain amount of objectivity. If you 
are too sincere, you don't know what you are doing with your hands and eyes. 
The politicians watch themselves and their words." 
</P>
<P>
"I am happy and proud to be a comic basso," he said. "I have worked years in 
front of a video camera to develop my attitude, my looks, my reactions to comic 
situations." 
</P>
<P>
Among the 40 roles Loup performs, his comic roles are nearly all from the 18th- 
and 19th-Century opera repertory. The successful comic opera, he noted, is rare 
in this century. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a typical modern attitude. They do not want to laugh anymore -- 
everything has to have a philosophical bent," Loup said.

<P>
Contemporary musical styles have not been particularly conducive to the comic 
muse, either. Loup cited Frank Martin's 1962 opera, "Monsieur de Pourceaugnac," 
which the noted serial Swiss composer based on a Moliere comedy. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a well-written opera, but, when I sang it, I felt no comic feeling 
coming out of the opera. Whenever Poulenc is comic, for example in his 'Les 
Mamelles de Tiresias,' his style is tonal." 
</P>
<P>
Loup comes from a long line of educators. His father, writer and educator 
Robert Loup, founded the school Francois attended in his native 
Estavayer-le-Lac, Switzerland. Although Loup's performing prevents him from 
carrying on the family pedagogical tradition, he does run an informal summer 
school for singers at his home in Bourges, 120 miles south of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
"During the summer, I have five or six students who come and live at the farm. 
Completely abandoned from the rest of the world, they can concentrate on 
singing. They sleep well and eat well, because I like to cook," Loup said.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: STAGE / NANCY CHURNIN: NEW PLAYS SPROUTING AS SPRING 
APPROACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Spring is coming, and with it the inky aroma of new plays. Some will venture 
forth in the Old Globe Theatre's Play Discovery Series -- a farm club for Globe 
shows -- which continues Monday with a reading of Mark Lee's "Paradise," and 
Teatro Meta's Latino Play Discovery Series, which presents a workshop of "The 
Granny" at the Progressive Stage Company March 10-12. 
</P>
<P>
Terrence McNally's "Up in Saratoga" will bypass early developmental stages when 
it springs up as a full production Thursday at the Globe. And even Edward Albee 
will get into the act when he comes to town to tape an introduction to the 
California Young Playwrights Project winner, "Simply Maria, or the American 
Dream," to be shown on KPBS-TV. Albee will read from his latest work, "Marriage 
Play," Sunday morning at the Hahn Cosmopolitan Theatre. The show is already 
scheduled for Broadway and London engagements. 
</P>
<P>
But the big news at the Gaslamp Quarter Theatre is that contracts have been 
signed and money has exchanged hands on "The Debutante," a twist on the 
"Pygmalion" story that re-imagines the tale in upper-class black society in the 
1920s. 
</P>
<P>
It is not the nonprofit Gaslamp that commissioned the play but a new, 
for-profit company, Debutante Inc., set up by Gaslamp managing director Kit 
Goldman. The company plans to hire the Gaslamp to produce the play early next 
year. This doesn't mean Goldman, president of Debutante, has yet signed her 
hoped-for star, Cleavon Little, or director, Oz Scott, both of whom now have 
the script. It means she fell in love with the writing by Elmo Terry-Morgan and 
decided to go with her instincts, which told her she has a hot property on her 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
"I work on the Cortez theory of doing business," Goldman said. "They came on 
shore and burned the ships so there was no choice but to go ahead and conquer. 
I went ahead and burned the ships. This is new territory for me. I have never 
commissioned a script. But I'm very excited. The characters are wonderful and 
the story is excellent. Mark Loigman, production manager at La Jolla Playhouse 
for two years, is working with me to make up budgets and sell shares." 
</P>
<P>
Goldman said the Gaslamp's financial struggles this year only fueled her 
determination to press ahead with the project. Like other theater directors 
taking a gamble on new plays, she knows that launching an untested project may 
prove to be a disastrous expense, but she is buoyed by the hope that, if the 
show takes off, the Gaslamp may reap heaps of critical and financial rewards. 
</P>
<P>
"This project had a life and schedule of its own. I hope I'm never so 
distracted by the present that I miss entrepreneurial opportunities," Goldman 
said. "We have a plan for financial stability and stature, and part of the plan 
is 'The Debutante.' " 
</P>
<P>
The audience may not be captive, but the performers certainly will be when 
seven minimum-security inmates from the Richard J. Donovan Correctional 
Facility in Otay Mesa will present three one-act plays at the Lyceum Space in 
Horton Plaza April 15-16. 
</P>
<P>
The warden and a handful of guards have already made their reservations. 
</P>
<P>
This outside venture is a first for California prisoners, according to Spike 
Sorrentino, a local director and actor who has been directing the inmates 
toward this goal for four months. 
</P>
<P>
Sorrentino voiced a familiar directorial complaint about the job: "It was hard 
to get good talent and hard to hold onto it." 
</P>
<P>
While other directors lose actors to the competition, he lost his as they 
finished their jail sentences. 
</P>
<P>
Another challenge, he said, was building trust. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys in minimum figure they aren't going to be in there that long, so they 
wonder why they should put their faces out there and show everyone they're 
prisoners." 
</P>
<P>
One powerful motivation for them, he said, is that ticket sales from "The Actor 
and the Invader," by Robert Patrick, "Rats," by Israel Horovitz, and "The 
Scam," by local playwright Christopher R, will benefit the San Diego Crime 
Victims Fund. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Havis, a professor of playwrighting at UC San Diego, was one of six 
playwrights to win the McKnight Fellowship in Playwrighting, a national award 
given by the Minneapolis Playwrights' Center to writers who are judged to have 
had a significant impact on the field of theater. Havis, who received his MFA 
from the Yale School of Drama, has had his plays produced in a variety of 
theaters across the country from the American Repertory Theatre to the WPA to 
the South Coast Repertory Theatre, which most recently produced his works "Haut 
Gout" and "Morocco." 
</P>
<P>
Local actors David Novak, Courtney Flanagan and Philip Sneed will tour "The 
Kingdom of Midas," a new one-act children's play written by Novak and Flanagan, 
to several San Diego schools March 16-May 24. Under the auspices of the San 
Diego Institute for Arts Education, the actors will assign the students to the 
supporting roles of courtiers, farmers and attendants in the story of the king 
who wanted everything he touched turn to gold -- until his wish was granted. 
Call Ann Chase, program director, at (619)452-3840 for further information. 
</P>
<P>
PROGRAM NOTES: Nearly half the 25 recipients of the semiannual COMBO (Combined 
Arts and Education Council of San Diego County) awards went to theaters this 
year. Some of the much-needed pennies from heaven went to the Bowery Theatre, 
which is planning on a June opening for its new Gaslamp-area space and 
Diversionary Theatre, which received backing for a production of Charles 
Ludlam's "Reverse Psychology." . . . The San Diego Actors Co-Op will hold its 
second annual All-City Audition March 6-7 and 13-14 at the San Diego Repertory 
Theatre's Lyceum Space, where they will do their monologues on the set of 
"Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You." . . . The North Coast Repertory 
Theatre will follow up "The Mandrake" with "Cat's Paw," a story about 
terrorism, in its two-play summer series. . . . The Marquis Public Theatre, 
which had to cancel plans for "Waiting for Godot" when it learned that the Old 
Globe had the rights and "The Marriage of Bette and Boo" when it found out the 
San Diego Repertory Theatre had the rights, is trying again with August 
Strindberg's "A Dream Play," opening April 13.

 AGENT LOSES PLEA ON TAX ASSESSMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles federal judge has rejected a request to overturn a $566,000 
jeopardy assessment by the Internal Revenue Service against the holdings of 
former federal drug agent Darnell Garcia, a fugitive since Nov. 22 in a major 
drug corruption probe. U.S. District Judge William J. Rea rejected a petition 
by the ex-agent's wife, Adeline Garcia, despite noting that he had "many 
questions about the government's case" in moving to seize Garcia's assets. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing on the tax matter produced testimony that IRS agents filed the tax 
lien after being told that alleged associates of Garcia and "somebody" 
resembling Garcia had 150 kilograms of cocaine for sale in 1985. The IRS 
estimated the income from the sale at $3.4 million and based the assessment on 
that figure. Attorney Mark Borenstein, representing Adeline Garcia, had urged 
Rea to "at least" reduce the assessment to $49,000 allegedly owed in taxes for 
1985. Borenstein said the case will be taken to the U.S. Tax Court. At issue is 
whether the government can seize Garcia's $581,000 home in Rancho Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
The former agent is charged with conspiring to sell cocaine and heroin with two 
other former U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents, John Anthony Jackson 
and Wayne Countryman.

 NO RULING ISSUED IN VIDEOTAPED ARREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge declined Thursday to issue a ruling that defense lawyers had hoped 
would lead to dismissal of a charge of resisting arrest against a black 
activist, whose confrontation with a Long Beach police officer was videotaped 
by an NBC television crew. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Municipal Judge Gary R. Hahn refused to find that Don Jackson's 
constitutional rights were violated when police officers pulled over the car in 
which he was riding Jan. 14. The videotape appears to show a white police 
officer pushing Jackson's head through a plate-glass window. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn said that matter can be brought up at Jackson's trial, scheduled to start 
March 15. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's attorneys said that if the judge had ruled in their favor, the 
misdemeanor charge would have to be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
At the pretrial hearing, Long Beach city prosecutors disclosed they are trying 
to obtain Jackson's personnel records from the Hawthorne Police Department. 
Jackson, a police sergeant, is on administrative leave. Jackson's attorney, 
Hugh Manes, said the attempt is "a ploy to intimidate and discredit" his 
client.

 $2-MILLION BAIL SET FOR TODD BRIDGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Municipal Judge David Horwitz set bail in the amount of $2 million 
Thursday for actor Todd Bridges, who is charged with the attempted murder of a 
man inside a reputed "rock house." 
</P>
<P>
Bridges, 23, the former child star of NBC-TV's "Diff'rent Strokes," had been 
held without bail since his arrest a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges remained in custody and faces a March 9 preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges is also being held in an unrelated case in Compton in which he is 
charged with stealing his BMW automobile at gunpoint from a South Los Angeles 
repair man without paying a $500 bill. The alleged robbery occurred about two 
weeks before the shooting.

PLAN TO SPUR AMNESTY PROCESS IS UNVEILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARITA HERNANDEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Immigration officials in Los Angeles, acknowledging that response to the second 
stage of the amnesty program has gotten off to an alarmingly slow start, on 
Thursday unveiled measures aimed at easing the application process. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not quite sure if it is confusion or procrastination," but only about 
13% of eligible applicants have bothered to file for permanent resident status 
so far, Harold Ezell, western regional commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service, said at a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the reason," Ezell added, "it is a very serious problem." 
</P>
<P>
About 1 million immigrants applied for amnesty in the Western states -- more 
than half the nation's total -- and most have gained temporary resident status. 
But in order to retain their legal status, amnesty recipients must apply for 
permanent resident status in the program's second phase that began last fall. 
(Nearly 800,000 additional immigrants in the West applied for amnesty under a 
special farm workers provision, but they are exempt from the second phase's 
requirements.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Have Applied 
</P>
<P>
Only about 40,000 of the more than 300,000 amnesty applicants in the region who 
are eligible so far have filed for permanent resident status. The others will 
become eligible as their staggered deadlines come due over the next nine 
months. 
</P>
<P>
The deadlines are part of the confusion, INS officials and immigrant advocates 
agree. Starting on the date an immigrant filed for temporary resident status, 
the applicant must remain in that category for 18 months before becoming 
eligible for permanent resident status. Applicants then have one year to apply 
for permanent residency. If they fail to do so, they revert to illegal status. 
</P>
<P>
To encourage the timely filing of applications, INS officials announced a 
fundamental change in the process. Applicants may now file permanent resident 
applications immediately. Application forms are available at all INS 
legalization offices. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're confused as to when to file . . . or in doubt, file now," said 
Ernest Gustafson, Los Angeles INS district director. 
</P>
<P>
Gustafson said the INS will then notify these applicants as their eligibility 
deadline approaches and their permanent resident interviews come up. 
</P>
<P>
Other steps aimed at clearing the confusion over the law's requirements include 
establishing full-time information booths at all INS legalization offices and 
increasing publicity, Ezell said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Church Group Exams 
</P>
<P>
Officials also announced that the "proficiency exam" -- which applicants may 
now take at INS legalization offices in lieu of a required English, U.S. 
history and government course -- will soon be offered by community and church 
organizations as well. 
</P>
<P>
The first of many groups expected to offer the test, beginning in about two 
weeks, are: Catholic Charities of the Los Angeles Catholic Archdiocese; St. 
Simon's Episcopal Church in San Fernando; The Private Immigration Agency based 
in Huntington Park, and the Bellflower chapter of the League of United Latin 
American Citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Although immigrant advocates generally lauded the INS' latest efforts at 
encouraging a greater response from amnesty applicants, they urged the agency 
to go even further in its efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to use many different creative ways," said Stewart Kwoh, 
director of the Asian Pacific American Legal Center of Southern California. 
"There is a great need for a stronger and more concerted outreach effort." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Absolute Confusion' 
</P>
<P>
Susan Alva, a spokeswoman for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los 
Angeles, said that members of the group report "absolute confusion" among 
applicants over the complicated filing deadlines, as well as the varied 
alternatives for fulfilling the program's educational requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Many people, she said, are unaware that they do not need to take a test or 
special classes; those exempted include the very young, the elderly and those 
with some formal education in the United States. Some applicants also are 
having trouble finding English classes in which to enroll, she said. 
</P>
<P>
While encouraged by the INS' "positive steps" for making more information 
available at its legalization offices, Alva urged officials to make sure the 
measures are implemented. Too often, she said, officials' pronouncements are 
not followed through at the legalization offices. "Expectations are raised and 
when the service is not there, the frustration among applicants is doubled," 
she said.

2 ARMORIES ADDED TO HOMELESS SHELTER LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH LU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because of a surge in the number of homeless people seeking county vouchers for 
motel rooms this winter, two National Guard armories in the San Gabriel Valley 
have been added to the list of facilities available for use as emergency 
shelters on cold and rainy nights. 
</P>
<P>
An armory in Pomona was opened to the homeless Thursday, when Los Angeles 
County's cold weather shelter program was activated for the first time since 
Feb. 15. A Monrovia armory had also been scheduled for use but remained closed 
because Salvation Army workers expected to operate the facility were out of 
town, a county spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"They assured us by (Friday) they will be available," said Larry Johnson, a 
spokesman for the county's homeless coordination office. 
</P>
<P>
The expanded use of armories comes as homeless program officials are preparing 
to request extra funds from the Board of Supervisors for the second time this 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the recent stretch of warm weather, the number of homeless people 
seeking emergency shelter from the county has nearly tripled from last year. 
The shelter program has already received one supplemental allocation from the 
supervisors -- $325,000 on Jan. 31 -- but only $50,000 remains, and officials 
are planning to ask the board for another $125,000 on Tuesday, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the new allocation will bring funding for for the cold weather 
program this season to $775,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the $125,000 will be ample to get us through," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-year-old shelter program runs from Nov. 1 to March 31. After that date, 
officials will review the operation, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to redesign the program so we can bring the cost down," he said. "It 
really is much more expensive than anyone had envisioned." 
</P>
<P>
The county provides emergency shelter when the overnight temperature is 
expected to dip below 40 degrees or when the forecast calls for temperatures 
below 50 degrees with a 50% chance of rain. 
</P>
<P>
The county has offered shelter at National Guard armories in Long Beach and 
Culver City since last winter and in West Los Angeles since December. The 
county also houses homeless people at a federal shelter in Bell. 
</P>
<P>
The armories accommodate from 150 to 300 people each, and those in Long Beach 
and Culver City have been filled to capacity when opened. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the two San Gabriel Valley armories were made available after 
word spread among homeless people that two social service agencies there -- in 
El Monte and Pomona -- would provide them with free housing in motels, rather 
than in the mass shelters available elsewhere. Hundreds of people flocked to 
the two agencies. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, only homeless families with children now will get the motel 
vouchers in the San Gabriel Valley, officials said. The Pomona office is 
directing single adults to the armory in that community, while the El Monte 
office will send homeless singles to the Monrovia armory. 
</P>
<P>
In downtown Los Angeles and coastal communities such as Santa Monica, where 
there are high concentrations of homeless adults, the county from the start of 
the program has housed single adults in the armories, while giving families 
motel vouchers, according to Verta Nash, coordinator of the county's efforts to 
help the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
But in the San Gabriel Valley, where last winter 85% of the homeless seeking 
assistance were families, the county had been issuing motel vouchers to all 
homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that group shelter is not conducive to families, so we voucher them to 
hotels," Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
The problem in the San Gabriel Valley this winter apparently arose when 
homeless adults in a wide area learned that they could get the more desirable 
motel housing there, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drawn From Afar 
</P>
<P>
The voucher applicants have come from as far as Long Beach, Santa Monica and 
San Bernardino County, authorities said. In contrast to last year, more than 
90% of the homeless served in the San Gabriel Valley this winter have been 
single men and women, Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that the numbers have increased significantly out there due to 
people coming from San Bernardino County," which has no shelter program for the 
homeless, Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
In the El Monte service center operated by Catholic Charities, the staff 
processed more than 300 voucher applications a day when the bad weather program 
was activated. At the Pomona Neighborhood Center, which also has a contract 
with the county to administer the program, an average of 50 adults and 10 
families streamed through each day. 
</P>
<P>
Paying $16 a night a person for motel rooms, county officials discovered that 
the cost for the voucher program was escalating faster than they had expected. 
Complicating matters is an unusually cold winter, which triggered more frequent 
demand for emergency shelter, despite the recent warm spell. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Cold Days 
</P>
<P>
For example, in the San Gabriel Valley, the county had to activate the cold 
weather program for only 24 days last winter. This winter, the program has been 
activated on 57 days. 
</P>
<P>
So far this season, the county has made available more than 20,000 bed spaces, 
nearly double the 10,264 for all of last winter, Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
Housing the homeless in armories, at $9 to $10 a person a night, is a more 
cost-effective alternative, Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
The county's decision to make use of the extra armories was welcomed by the 
directors of the service centers. 
</P>
<P>
Alma Vielma said her El Monte office has been overwhelmed by the logistics of 
administering the voucher program. With just one full-time staff member, Vielma 
has had to recruit some of the homeless clients to help her issue the vouchers, 
telephone motels to check for vacancies and distribute free food. 
</P>
<P>
The El Monte office, which has a $49,000 county contract to administer the 
shelter program, has already spent more than $143,000, Vielma said. The agency 
is scheduled to amend its contract with county officials today, said Greg 
Fitzgerald, associate director of Catholic Charities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agencies Back Out 
</P>
<P>
Running the shelter program is so demanding that nearly a dozen agencies that 
helped administer the program last year backed out this winter, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Its' a very difficult program without having armories open," Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
Caught off-guard Thursday when the county announced that the Monrovia armory 
was not ready for use, Vielma had to refer homeless clients to the Pomona 
armory. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Kumar, director of the Pomona Neighborhood Center, a nonprofit 
community service organization, said use of the Pomona armory will help bring 
costs under control. 
</P>
<P>
Last winter, her office distributed $13,000 in hotel vouchers. This year, the 
cost is above $100,000, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the limitation on distribution of motel vouchers in the San Gabriel 
Valley, all homeless people seeking assistance in Lancaster -- where the county 
has been unable to find a social service agency to oversee an armory shelter -- 
will continue to be issued such vouchers in cold weather, Nash said. But there 
has been no flocking of the homeless to that area because it is remote, 
officials said.

BONUSES THREATENED BY BILINGUAL POLICY RIFT 
</P>

The president of the Los Angeles teachers union said Thursday he will oppose a 
group's efforts to rescind proposed bonuses for the district's 4,000 bilingual 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Johnson, president of United Teachers-Los Angeles, said the vote to 
rescind the bonuses, sought by Learning English Advocates Drive, a group of 
teachers seeking to end bilingual education, "will divide teachers at a crucial 
time." The union represents a majority of teachers in the Los Angeles Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
The English advocates group has said it will try to reverse the union's policy 
of demanding higher pay for the district's 4,000 bilingual classroom teachers. 
But the group said Thursday it now may delay the referendum until after the 
teachers settle their contract dispute with the district. 
</P>
<P>
District officials said passage of the proposal would make it difficult to 
continue bilingual education in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Bad for Teachers' 
</P>
<P>
"The referendum at this time is bad for teachers and it is bad for our 
organization," Johnson said. "I hope that it will either be withdrawn or the 
membership will reject it." 
</P>
<P>
Bilingual education has been a controversial issue in Los Angeles and 
throughout the nation. Advocates say it is the best method for teaching 
students who are not fluent in English; opponents say it slows the learning 
process. The Los Angeles school district now uses bilingual teachers to 
instruct students in basic subjects in languages other than English. Learning 
English Advocates Drive has advocated using English with interpreting help from 
a bilingual aide. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and the union's executive board are engaged in a campaign urging the 
union's 22,000 members to reject, in a vote next week, the district's current 
offer of a 20% pay raise over three years. The union has asked for a 21% raise 
over two years. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the English advocate group's proposal is causing internal fighting 
that could jeopardize the union's position. The executive board late Wednesday 
agreed to oppose the English group's proposal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Latino Parents Angry 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's rejection of the referendum comes amid growing pressure from 
bilingual teachers and Latino parents angry over the proposal. The school 
district has the nation's largest number of limited English-speaking students, 
mostly Latino. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 teachers and parents met Wednesday at the Eastman Avenue School 
in East Los Angeles to sign petitions and write letters on behalf of the 
district's bilingual program. Teachers at the meeting said they were critical 
of their union for failing to reject the English group's proposal immediately. 
</P>
<P>
A second meeting at the union's downtown headquarters has been planned for 
Wednesday, said Mark Meza-Overstreet, a bilingual teacher and leader of the 
union's Chicano Education Committee. His committee has begun fund-raising 
efforts to pay for mailers and other materials to fight the referendum. 
</P>
<P>
Sally Peterson, president and founder of Learning English Advocates Drive, said 
the group is not an English-only organization. But she acknowledged that it 
receives financial support from two national English-only organizations: U.S. 
English and English First. Peterson said she is disappointed that the union 
leadership opposes the group's referendum. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bonuses Called Essential 
</P>
<P>
School district officials and other supporters of bilingual education say the 
annual bonuses are essential for recruiting and keeping qualified bilingual 
teachers. Without the pay incentives, bilingual teachers would go to other 
districts that pay more money, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The district and union negotiators have tentatively agreed on bonuses of up to 
$5,000 a year for fully certificated bilingual classroom teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers and district officials say the referendum will have a big effect on 
how schools will teach the more than 160,000 Los Angeles students who speak 
only limited English, most of them Spanish-speaking. Some studies contend that 
elementary pupils tend to progress faster if they are taught academic subjects 
in their native language while they are learning English. 
</P>
<P>
But Peterson, a kindergarten teacher at Glenwood Elementary School in Sun 
Valley, disputes those studies and said her group favors English-speaking 
teachers with bilingual aides.

MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO MOLESTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The former music director of classical radio station KUSC-FM has pleaded guilty 
to molesting an 8-year-old girl while posing as a physician and pretending to 
examine her for an infection. 
</P>
<P>
David Jay Letterman, 40, entering his guilty plea in Los Angeles Superior Court 
on Tuesday, was charged with one felony count of lewd conduct with a child 
under age 14. 
</P>
<P>
Letterman, who remains free, was scheduled to be sentenced April 4. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said the molestation occurred after Letterman went to the victim's 
house and, posing as a doctor, asked her mother for permission to examine the 
child for an infection. 
</P>
<P>
A station spokesman said Letterman no longer works at KUSC. The spokesman was 
unsure whether Letterman was fired or had quit.

200 SOLVENT S&amp;LS EXPECTED TO FAIL IN NEXT 2 YEARS; 
</P>
<P>
400 OTHERS IN JEOPARDY IF THEY CAN'T RAISE CAPITAL, ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES

<P>
White House Budget Director Richard Darman, giving a preview of a drastically 
altered savings and loan industry, said Thursday that the Bush Administration 
expects 200 currently solvent S&amp;Ls to fail within the next two years, in 
addition to the 345 insolvent institutions already slated for shutdown or sale. 
</P>
<P>
Another 400 thrifts face likely extinction if they cannot raise additional 
capital to meet the tough new financial standards proposed by the 
Administration as part of its S&amp;L rescue package, Darman told the Senate 
Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts have been predicting a drastic shrinkage of the troubled 
S&amp;L industry, which totaled about 3,000 institutions as of mid-1988, before 
the closure or merger of 223 of them. 
</P>
<P>
But Darman is the first Administration official to offer such a forecast, and 
independent analysts said he might be underestimating the potential industry 
shakeout. Bert Ely, a consultant in Alexandria, Va., predicted that as many as 
800 to 900 more S&amp;Ls could be wiped out, compared to Darman's 600. 
</P>
<P>
Darman also warned that the ultimate costs of the Bush program to dispose of 
insolvent S&amp;Ls and guarantee deposits up to $100,000 could balloon beyond 
the current estimate of $94 billion from taxpayers during the full 33-year 
period of paying off the bonds that would finance the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
If the Administration had to offer higher-than-estimated interest rates on the 
bonds, Darman said, that could add substantially to repayment costs. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald W. Reigle Jr. said the Administration 
seemed to be asking Congress to write "a blank check" to finance the bailout. 
</P>
<P>
Darman responded: "That obligation and the (deposit) insurance are already 
there." 
</P>
<P>
The exchange demonstrated the only certainty in the fast-changing S&amp;L 
debate: The federal government will honor its promise to protect deposits up to 
$100,000. The disappearance of hundreds of S&amp;Ls from the beleaguered 
industry, accompanied by the closing of thousands of branch offices, will not 
jeopardize depositors with insured savings. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, federal regulators continued their campaign of seizing control of 
insolvent institutions. The thrifts are placed under conservatorships, allowing 
regulators to have ultimate control of key business decisions on interest 
rates, mortgage charges and investment policies. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. took control of 37 institutions in six 
states, bringing to 73 the total number of thrifts brought under the agency's 
control since President Bush announced his bailout plan last month. 
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's action, the biggest to date, the FDIC seized 12 S&amp;Ls in 
Texas, 10 in Kansas, eight in Arkansas, four in Louisiana, two in Alaska and 
one in Maryland. They have total assets of $7.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Darman's disclosure before the Senate committee set the stage for a fierce 
political battle between the S&amp;L industry and the banking business. 
</P>
<P>
The healthy S&amp;Ls, already burdened by a heavy premium for their federal 
deposit insurance, want extra time to meet the new capital standards that would 
take effect in 1991 if Congress approves the Bush plan. Under the plan, 
S&amp;Ls would have to maintain capital reserves equal to 6% of assets, 
compared with 3% now. 
</P>
<P>
But the bankers, which will also face a 6% capital requirement in 1991, want 
Congress to show no mercy to the thrifts, their rivals for consumer savings. 
They argue that federal regulators have been too soft on S&amp;Ls for too long. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope lawmakers won't go soft with sympathy on new S&amp;L capital 
standards," Thomas Rideout, president of the American Bankers Assn., said 
Thursday. "Misplaced sympathy got the S&amp;Ls into this mess in the first 
place by avoiding tough regulation." 
</P>
<P>
After hearing a pep talk from Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, 450 bankers 
enthusiastically endorsed the Administration plan and descended on Senate and 
House offices in a lobbying blitz. The Bush plan would offer banks a chance to 
buy sick S&amp;Ls for two years and healthy ones after that. 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;L industry says the new capital rule would be an impossible burden in 
the short run. 
</P>
<P>
Forcing all S&amp;Ls to amass 6% capital in two years is "obviously 
unreasonable," said James Grohl, senior vice president of the U.S. League of 
Savings Institutions. "The time period is far too short. It's got to get phased 
in, and Congress understands that." 
</P>
<P>
Darman said about 770 solvent S&amp;Ls now fall short of the proposed capital 
standard. Some 170 will have no trouble meeting the standard, he told the 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
Another 200 undoubtedly "will fail, with or without a capital requirement," 
Darman said. 
</P>
<P>
And 400 more, he said, "need new outside capital to make it." This group has 
about 10% of the industry's total deposits of about $1 trillion.

AGREEMENT WITH GM CRITICIZED; 
</P>
<P>
STOCK DEAL MAY HURT HUGHES EMPLOYEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In signing a sweeping $975-million accord to mend a contentious dispute with 
its largest shareholder earlier this week, General Motors may have struck a 
financial blow at thousands of employees of its Hughes Aircraft subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like the little guys got left out," one knowledgeable Hughes insider 
said. 
</P>
<P>
GM announced Tuesday that it had agreed to a major restructuring of its 1985 
acquisition of Hughes Aircraft from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the 
previous sole owner of the Los Angeles-based aerospace firm. 
</P>
<P>
That agreement, however, did not specifically cover Hughes Aircraft or other GM 
employees, even though they constitute one of the largest groups of individual 
holders of a special class of GM stock known as GM H. The auto maker created 
H-class stock and issued most of it to the medical institute to help finance 
GM's $5.2-billion acquisition of Hughes four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, however, many employees have chosen to receive H stock in various 
company incentive and savings plans in the belief that they could piggyback on 
a stock price guarantee that GM gave the medical institute. But the guarantee 
was nullified by the restructuring agreement announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, GM H stock has dropped sharply this week. Moreover, securities 
analysts say the stock is still overvalued and could drop even further, eroding 
the value of Hughes employees' retirement and incentive accounts. It closed 
Thursday at $25.375, down another 62.5 cents. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview earlier this week, GM Treasurer Leon Krain said the company is 
"responsible to all stockholders to make sure they are fairly treated" and that 
employees "don't constitute a special class of stockholders." 
</P>
<P>
Krain asserted that the restructuring plan is beneficial to all shareholders, 
including employees. But GM agreed to buy 35 million H shares from the medical 
institute for $975 million, which amounts to $27.86 or 9.8% above the current 
trading price. Krain said the payment is part of a package that included other 
concessions, however. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hughes Vice President Lucius Gregg said Thursday that the revised 
agreement will benefit employees in the long term by creating a more orderly 
market for H shares. "It is in GM's interest to keep the value up," he added. 
</P>
<P>
GM will not say how many of the 27 million H shares in public hands are owned 
by employees. GM itself owns 308 million H shares and the medical institute 
owns 64.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Based on GM financial disclosures, company executives hold at least 9.7 million 
H shares, not counting those in employees' savings plans. That represents about 
36% of the publicly held shares. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of stock was issued for only $20.03 a share to employee savings, bonus 
and incentive plans, so employees may not be losing money even at current 
prices. But until this week it appeared that the stock would be worth $30 a 
share at the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
That is because GM had guaranteed to the medical institute, as part of the 1985 
purchase of Hughes, that the H stock would trade at $30 a share at the end of 
1989 or that GM would make up the difference up to $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The sudden nullification of that guarantee, even though it was never officially 
extended to employees, could depress the price of H stock. 
</P>
<P>
GM has helped to prop up the value of H shares by purchasing shares on the open 
market. During the last two years, the company has purchased 3 million shares. 
That represents an average of about 6,000 shares every business day. 
</P>
<P>
Since trading volume is frequently under 12,000 shares per day, GM has 
essentially been the biggest buyer of its own stock. GM spokesmen declined to 
discuss these trading activities. 
</P>
<P>
But Krain, the GM treasurer, said, "I am totally against the assertion that we 
propped up the stock." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Krain said the automotive giant would continue to buy back its H 
shares. At the same time, GM pledged in its restructuring agreement to increase 
public holding of H stock to 50 million shares by 1994 to help create a viable 
market. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear how GM can repurchase shares while also increasing public 
ownership by 23 million shares. Krain acknowledged that there is an apparent 
contradiction, but said the decision to sell or buy shares is a "matter of 
timing." 
</P>
<P>
Securities analysts are uncertain why GM would be buying H shares now in any 
case, since it appears that they are overvalued. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Wall Street's leading experts on H stock, Paul Nisbet of Prudential 
Bache Securities and Jack Modewleski of Paine Webber, both estimated that H 
shares are worth no more than $20 on their fundamentals. 
</P>
<P>
In an advisory to Paine Webber clients, Modewleski wrote earlier this week, " . 
. . the current agreement eliminates one of the primary reasons for holding GM 
H stock -- that somehow the $30-per-share guarantee to the institute by GM 
would also benefit the other shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the H stock held by employees was issued as part of an extraordinary 
$250-million incentive plan set up in March 1985, which itself has left bitter 
feelings among many Hughes management and technical staff employees who are 
unhappy over how the money was distributed. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is known as the Long Term Incentive Plan (known inside Hughes as 
"L-Tips") and included 1,000 Hughes senior employees. The fund was charged 
against earnings that year, resulting in a loss the first year that GM owned 
Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, L-Tip participants were allowed a one-time opportunity to convert 
their awards into GM H stock. They received a total of 7.4 million H shares, 
according to a footnote in GM Hughes Electronics Corp.'s annual report. GM 
Hughes Electronics is the GM subsidiary that includes Hughes Aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The 7.4 million shares are being distributed in three equal annual 
installments, the first being last year. The second installment of about 2.5 
million is due this month and the final installment in March, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
At least some of the selling pressure on GM H has come from L-Tip shareholders, 
according to members of the plan, and the additional 2.5 million shares about 
to be issued could increase that pressure. 
</P>
<P>
(The effect may be mitigated by a provision under which GM may buy L-Tip shares 
directly from employees at the average market price in the 20 days preceding 
the award. But GM officials declined to discuss those details.) 
</P>
<P>
Many L-Tip participants are unhappy about the awards because they believe that 
the very highest executives have received a disproportionate share of the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
The fund was described in 1985 as an incentive for key scientists and engineers 
to stay with Hughes for at least three years. But it has since become apparent 
that another purpose was to reward top executives, many of whom were ready to 
retire. 
</P>
<P>
Interviews with several participants in the L-Tip program indicate that the 27 
corporate officers of Hughes Aircraft may have received as much as $100 million 
of the $250-million fund. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$6.5-Million Bonus 
</P>
<P>
GM disclosed in 1985 that former Hughes Aircraft Chairman Allen E. Puckett, for 
example, received $6.5 million. A group of other top officers, including group 
presidents and top corporate staffers, received $3 million each, according to 
knowledgeable sources. Meanwhile, many lower-ranking scientists and engineers 
at Hughes received awards of $50,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
"I was personally disgruntled," one scientist said. "It was a situation where 
the first guy at the dinner table took a heaping helping of mashed potatoes, 
and the next guy took what he wanted, and by the time the potatoes got to the 
end of the table, there wasn't much left." 
</P>
<P>
Another former executive observed, "It was a gift horse, so how could you 
complain? But once people found out how much the guys at the top were getting 
there was a lot of disgruntlement." 
</P>
<P>
Hughes Chairman Malcolm Currie sharply disagreed with that assessment in an 
interview last October, saying that senior management pushed for broad 
participation. 
</P>
<P>
"The real intent of it was to build for the future," Currie said. But he 
acknowledged that the plan also sought to reward past service of senior 
executives.

GAF Holders OK Bid: GAF Corp. shareholders overwhelmingly approved a 
$1.47-billion buyout by a group led by the specialty chemical company's 
Chairman and Chief Executive Samuel Heyman. Of 27.8 million outstanding shares, 
more than 19 million were voted in favor of the management buyout. GAF 
shareholders will receive $46 per share in cash plus subordinated debentures 
designed to have a value of $7 per share. Heyman told shareholders that Morgan 
Stanley &amp; Co. will establish an interest rate for the debentures at the end 
of next week or the following week. A special committee of independent 
directors approved the offer in October, 1988, after Heyman's group sweetened 
the offer from about $1.4 billion.

SALES OF NEW HOMES UP 4.9%; WEATHER CITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sales of new, single-family homes posted their biggest gain in seven months 
during January, the government reported Thursday, but analysts attributed the 
4.9% increase in part to unusually mild winter weather. 
</P>
<P>
Sales reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 704,000 in January, after a 
2% increase in December, the Commerce Department said. New sales were bolstered 
by strong activity in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Seiders, chief economist for the National Assn. of Home Builders, said 
much of January's increase probably occurred because warm weather brought more 
people out to shop for homes, borrowing sales from future months. 
</P>
<P>
The increase also may reflect a temporary dip in mortgage rates during the 
month, which gave home buyers a "window of opportunity to move into the 
market," Seiders said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rising Rates Predicted 
</P>
<P>
January's strong showing aside, analysts are still forecasting a decline in 
construction of single-family homes this year, based on expectations that 
mortgage rates will rise during the first half of 1989 and the economy will 
slow. 
</P>
<P>
New home sales had edged up a slim 0.9% during 1988 after plunging 10.5% in 
1987, when the drop was blamed on increased interest rates and a slowdown in 
demand after five strong sales years. 
</P>
<P>
After temporarily sliding during January, fixed-rate home mortgages resumed 
their climb in February and last week were averaging 10.78%, up from 9.87% a 
year earlier, according to a national survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Economists predict that rates could reach 12% this year, although the 
increasing popularity of adjustable-rate mortgages that offer lower initial 
interest rates could mitigate damage to the single-family housing market. 
</P>
<P>
As the Federal Reserve Board continues to push up interest rates in an effort 
to slow economic growth and restrain inflation, higher rates "are really going 
to bite into the housing market," said economist Richard Peach of the Mortgage 
Bankers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to start to see some modest declines in housing market activity 
once we get the numbers for March, April and May," Peach predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Seiders said that with financial troubles plaguing the nation's savings and 
loans, which are the largest lenders of adjustable-rate mortgages, "we're kind 
of worried about the funds situation as we go out through 1989." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Median Price Slips 
</P>
<P>
January's increase in home sales was the biggest monthly jump since a 5.4% 
increase last June. 
</P>
<P>
The strength was concentrated in the Midwest, where sales rose 22.2% to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 110,000. 
</P>
<P>
Seiders said the increase was largely because of mild weather in that region, 
although the Midwest's housing market also has been aided by the strength of 
manufacturing industries experiencing rising export sales. 
</P>
<P>
Sales last month were up 8% in the West and rose 0.9% in the Northeast but 
declined 1.9% in the South. 
</P>
<P>
The median price for a new home, meanwhile, declined 6.9% in January to 
$113,000, meaning that half the homes sold for more and half for less. The 
average price, which is pulled up by sales of very expensive homes, was down 
8.2% to $137,100.

Visa Linkage With Discover: Credit card processor Visa USA has agreed to an 
electronic linkup with Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.'s Discover card that could lead 
to greater acceptance of Discover by merchants, a Sears spokesman said. The 
arrangement will enable merchants to run Discover cards through their Visa 
processing machines, sparing them the hassle of installing separate Discover 
authorization and computer terminals, a Sears division spokesman said. Sears 
said the electronic link will be established later this year.

Oil Price Soars: Energy futures headed higher, paced by rising prices for crude 
oil and wholesale home heating oil. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the 
April contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, settled 
44 cents higher at $18.72 a barrel, adding to Wednesday's gain of 13 cents. 
Contracts for more distant months posted slightly smaller increases. Among 
other refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, April unleaded 
gasoline rose to 52.21 cents a gallon from 51.56. Chris Gohler, in the energy 
group of Elders Futures Inc., said a combination of fundamental and technical 
factors pushed up crude prices.

Credit Repair Firm Settles: In what may be one of the largest monetary 
settlements ever obtained from a so-called credit repair firm, Action Credit 
Systems Inc. and two individuals agreed to repay customers $1.2 million to 
settle a Federal Trade Commission complaint. The FTC estimated that the amount 
was the total consumer injury arising from the activities of Action Credit, a 
California concern that misled consumers by falsely claiming it could improve 
customers' credit records and help them obtain credit cards.

SUTRO OFFICER IS ARRESTED IN BOOKMAKING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A high-ranking officer of a California stock brokerage has been arrested in 
connection with a bookmaking operation that allegedly handled hundreds of 
thousands of dollars worth of bets on horse racing and sporting events from 
brokers and others nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Juda, 42, executive vice president and head of institutional trading in Los 
Angeles for Sutro &amp; Co., a regional firm based in San Francisco, was 
arrested Wednesday on felony charges following a three-month investigation by 
the Los Angeles Police Department, Detective Michael Wixted said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Also arrested and charged was Vince Carsillo, 51, of Los Angeles, who allegedly 
ran the bookmaking operation out of a duplex in Hawthorne, Wixted said. 
Carsillo is not believed to be connected to Sutro. 
</P>
<P>
Juda -- a Hancock Park resident who also serves as a Sutro director and is said 
to earn as much as $1 million a year -- denied the allegations through his 
Century City attorney, Arthur Barens. 
</P>
<P>
"We categorically deny any wrongdoing on Mr. Juda's part, and we, like the 
police, are investigating the matter," Barens said. "Mr. Juda is a person of 
substance and is very significant in the brokerage community and hardly needs 
to be engaged in bookmaking." 
</P>
<P>
Barens, who called the case "bizarre," said Juda may be a victim of a "mistake 
in fact." He refused to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
According to Wixted, Juda is alleged to have handled individual bets at his 
office of as much as $400 on horses and thousands of dollars on sporting 
events. Juda then allegedly fed the wagers to Carsillo. The bets came from 
brokerage employees from as far away as Chicago, Wixted said. 
</P>
<P>
The bookmaking ring, all told, may have handled as much as $150,000 a week in 
bets, taking a cut of as much as 10%, Wixted said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was of the magnitude to warrant felony prosecution," Wixted said, noting 
that prosecutors usually don't seek felony charges against bookmakers unless 
their weekly volume totals more than $15,000 in horse wagering and more than 
$100,000 in sporting events. Police are still investigating to determine if 
others were involved, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Sutro said Juda still remains employed at the firm. They said they 
were cooperating with authorities and were conducting their own investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"The activities that are in question are unrelated to Sutro's business," said 
Susan Freund, a Sutro senior vice president and general counsel. "Sutro itself 
is not implicated in any wrongdoing, which isn't related to securities trading 
or any other brokerage activities of Sutro." 
</P>
<P>
Carsillo, who authorities said was under investigation previously for 
bookmaking but was never charged, could not be reached for comment. Both Juda 
and Carsillo were arrested and released on $500 bail, Wixted said. They will be 
arraigned on March 24, he said.

<P>
A drop in interest rates helped the stock market stage a broad advance 
Thursday, recouping Wednesday's losses. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 15.35 on Wednesday, climbed 22.67 
to 2,265.71. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide trading 
of New York Stock Exchange issues, with Big Board volume retreating to 161.98 
million shares from Wednesday's 177.21 million. 
</P>
<P>
A steady showing by the dollar against leading foreign currencies helped push 
bond prices higher in the credit markets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worries Seem to Be Easing 
</P>
<P>
That, in turn, seemed to encourage buying in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the worries about increasing inflation and Federal Reserve credit 
tightening that swept through the markets last week apparently were easing. 
</P>
<P>
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said he expects the increase in the consumer price 
index for February, which will be announced later this month, to be smaller 
than the 0.6% gain reported for January. 
</P>
<P>
On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, stock prices closed mostly higher Thursday in a 
combination of bargain hunting and profit taking. The key Nikkei 225-share 
index added 109.43, to close at 32,073.73. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices also closed higher on the London Stock Exchange, boosted by relief 
that the West German central bank, the Bundesbank, left its leading interest 
rates unchanged and by a strong performance on Wall Street. The Financial Times 
100-share index closed 18.4 points higher at 2,039.7. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
The dollar strengthened Thursday against most major currencies in thin trading 
after turning mixed overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices declined. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid of 
$383.50 an ounce, down 50 cents from late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Traders attributed the dollar's rise largely to technical factors, although 
they said the currency got some support from the West Germany's decision to 
keep interest rates unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
European traders said the dollar came under pressure against the British pound 
after the Bank of England intervened to support the weak currency by selling 
dollars for sterling. The pound had fallen because of unexpectedly bad figures 
on Britain's trade performance during January and persistent doubts about 
Britain's overall economic health. 
</P>
<P>
The pound closed in London at $1.7270, higher than Wednesday's late $1.7243. 
Later, in New York, sterling fetched $1.7125, down from $1.72325. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
closed at 128.07 Japanese yen, up from 127.68 yen. The dollar traded at 127.90 
yen in London and at 128.435 yen in New York, up from 128.225 yen late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to Wednesday's levels, included: 
1.8474 West German marks, up from 1.83675; 1.5824 Swiss francs, up from 1.5690; 
1.19485 Canadian dollars, down from 1.19875; 6.2880 French francs, up from 
6.2495, and 1,361.33 Italian lire, up from 1,354.25. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CREDIT 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices turned sharply higher Thursday on the strength of the dollar and on 
Greenspan's remarks on inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 23/32 point, or about $7.20 per 
$1,000 face amount, while its yield sank to 9.12% from 9.17% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 9.813%, up from 9.75% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
A mere hint of Soviet interest in buying sent the jittery soybean futures 
market into a powerful rally Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade and sparked 
some of the most active trading so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
Corn and oat futures also advanced, but wheat futures retreated after 
Wednesday's run-up on rumors, which were confirmed Thursday, that the Soviet 
Union had purchased 485,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets Thursday, energy futures surged, livestock and meat advanced, 
copper futures gained and precious metals were narrowly mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Soybeans settled 11.50 to 20.50 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in 
March at $7.675 a bushel; wheat was 2 to 3.75 cents lower, with March at 
$4.3625 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 3.75 cents higher, with March at $2.755 a 
bushel; oats were 2.25 to 6 cents higher, with March at $2.0875 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed rumors of Soviet plans to purchase U.S. corn and possibly some 
soybean meal touched off the late rally on the Board of Trade, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
The reaction was especially pronounced in the soybean market, which has become 
increasingly sensitive to demand factors as soybean supplies have tightened -- 
a function of last summer's drought.

BANK REGULATORS ISSUE WARNINGS ON 43 FACILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS FRANTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal authorities warned banks across the country on Thursday to exercise 
caution in dealing with 43 entities that may be conducting banking business 
illegally. 
</P>
<P>
Four institutions in Los Angeles and one each in San Diego and San Francisco 
were among the names on a list sent out by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., 
which regulates banks and insures bank deposits. 
</P>
<P>
The FDIC notice said these "banks" apparently were operating illegally and 
added: "Any proposed transactions involving any of the listed entities should 
be viewed with extreme caution." 
</P>
<P>
A federal banking regulator said a bank in the Southwest discovered Thursday 
morning that it had lost $36,000 in a scheme involving a fraudulent cashier's 
check drawn on one of the institutions, located on Montserrat in the West 
Indies. The regulator declined to identify the victimized bank and asked that 
his name be withheld. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Legitimate Uses 
</P>
<P>
The regulator said the number of entities operating as banks in the United 
States without proper authorization or license has increased substantially in 
recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Many banks on the FDIC warning list are located in Montserrat, where 
authorities have sold more than 200 bank charters in recent months, according 
to U.S. regulators. The names on the charters sound official and are often 
similar to those of established institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The charters are re-sold at high mark-ups by organized businesses to U.S. 
citizens, who then operate them in this country, according to testimony at 
congressional hearings conducted in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Although neither selling nor buying such a charter is illegal, experts told 
Congress there are few legitimate uses for these banks and they said many are 
used in illegal schemes, including issuing worthless cashier's checks and other 
types of financial instruments. 
</P>
<P>
In the case that came to light Thursday, a customer at the Southwestern bank 
cashed a $36,000 cashier's check drawn on Lux International Bancorp in 
Montserrat. The U.S. bank held the check for several days, assumed that it had 
cleared and gave the customer the cash. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the bank discovered that no funds had been received to honor the 
check, the customer had disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
For several months, federal law enforcement officials in California and other 
states have been investigating similar schemes involving worthless certified 
drafts drawn on nonexistent Mexican banks, including two of the 43 entities 
cited by the FDIC. 
</P>
<P>
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in Washington also is 
investigating off-shore banks and provided the names that the FDIC issued 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
James R. Dudine, an enforcement official with the FDIC in Washington, said the 
number of successful frauds pulled off using the questionable banks is 
relatively small. 
</P>
<P>
"Most banks are astute enough not to get caught with this sort of stuff. But 
there are some real dangers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the U.S. names on the list were not listed with telephone operators. 
</P>
<P>
One institution on the list is Banco Commercial Arabe in Los Angeles. Robert M. 
Talcott, an attorney for one of the institution's principals, said it does not 
function as a bank, but as a financial services company that arranges loans and 
joint ventures. He said the company is in compliance with appropriate 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
No telephone listings could be found for the three other Los Angeles entities 
-- Churchill International Bank, European Industrial Development Bank and 
Western Pacific Overseas Bank. 
</P>
<P>
There also was no listing for First International Bank &amp; Trust in San 
Diego. Officials said that entity should not be confused with a licensed, 
FDIC-insured bank with a similar name, First International Bank in Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several in the West 
</P>
<P>
A woman who identified herself as Julie Bone said Midcontinental Bank &amp; 
Trust in Atlanta, another name on the list, is a legal entity, but she refused 
to provide any more information. 
</P>
<P>
Below are the institutions on the FDIC list: Banco Commercial Arabe, Los 
Angeles; Banque Commerciale D'Haiti, Jamaica, N.Y.; British Bank of Commerce, 
Plymouth, Montserrat; British Bank of Commerce, Reno, Nev.; Caribbean Bankers 
Trust, Philipsburg, St. Maarten; Cayman Overseas Bank &amp; Trust, Georgetown,

A major American oil company confirmed Thursday that it had conducted 
exploratory business talks with Vietnam, even though the U.S. government has a 
trade embargo against the Southeast Asian nation. 
</P>
<P>
"A representative of Unocal Corp. did visit Vietnam in an exploratory meeting 
several weeks ago," said Art Bentley, a spokesman for the Los Angeles-based 
company. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no plans to proceed any further. That's about all I want to say 
about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the U.S. government has maintained an embargo on trading with the 
former enemy since the end of the Vietnam war in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, a senior Vietnamese economic official said two U.S. oil companies 
had begun investigating the possibility of investing in oil exploration in 
Vietnam with approval of the U.S. State Department. 
</P>
<P>
The two companies were identified as Unocal and Sun Co., headquartered in 
Radnor, Pa., by Nguyen Xuan Oanh, a member of the Vietnamese National Assembly 
and an economic adviser to the government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Venture With Soviets 
</P>
<P>
Sun denied sending any representative to Vietnam for talks. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam, in a joint venture with the Soviet Union, currently produces about 
15,000 barrels of oil a day from the Bach Ho (White Tiger) field off the coast 
of southern Vietnam, a field that was discovered by American oil companies in 
the waning days of the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
The Southeast Asian nation has signed exploration contracts with British 
Petroleum, the French company Total, Royal Dutch-Shell of the Netherlands and 
Petrofina of Belgium in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, a State Department official, who spoke on the condition that he 
not be identified, said Wednesday that many U.S. companies call and are told 
the U.S. embargo against Vietnam still stands. 
</P>
<P>
"We tell them it's all right to go and talk business. But it's against the law 
to do business," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese withdrawal from Cambodia is the main roadblock to U.S. normalization 
of relations and lifting of the embargo, he said.

3 WEST GERMAN 'HACKERS' HELD AS KGB SPIES 
</P>

Authorities have arrested three West German computer "hackers" on suspicion 
that they carried out international electronic espionage and sold sensitive 
data to the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB, judicial officials said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The ARD television network -- which made public the breakup of the spy ring 
after one of its affiliates carried out a 10-month investigation -- said the 
hackers helped the KGB gain access to computer data banks of the Pentagon, the 
nuclear arms laboratory at Los Alamos, N.M., and the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The KGB also received computer passwords and other materials from nuclear, 
space and commercial electronic data banks in West Germany, France, 
Switzerland, Britain and Japan, ARD said. 
</P>
<P>
"If current suspicions are confirmed, what we very surely have is a new quality 
of espionage against our data systems," Gerhard Boeden, Bonn's chief of 
domestic counterespionage, said in an interview with ARD. 
</P>
<P>
Existing Western computer systems are "not sufficiently" secured, said Boeden, 
who is president of the Federal Constitutional Protection Office. The agency is 
roughly equivalent to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the Interior Ministry and the federal prosecutor's office did not 
deny the detailed ARD report. But they provided only sketchy information on 
grounds that an investigation is still under way. 
</P>
<P>
A government spokeswoman in Bonn on Thursday evening declined to comment on a 
report by the West German news agency Deutsche Presse-Agentur quoting 
unidentified government security sources as saying the case is "extremely 
grave." 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the Pentagon issued a one-sentence statement saying: "Until 
possibly affected components of the Department of Defense have had a chance to 
analyze the report, we have no reaction." 
</P>
<P>
The hackers apparently provided the Soviets with opportunities to obtain North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization military secrets and information about sensitive 
high technology, the German news agency quoted the sources as saying. 
</P>
<P>
ARD described the affair as the most serious case of Soviet Bloc espionage to 
be discovered in West Germany since 1974, when Chancellor Willy Brandt resigned 
after a close personal aide was found to be an East German spy. 
</P>
<P>
Two men have been arrested in Hanover and a third in West Berlin, judicial 
officials said. Authorities have searched at least six residences in West 
Berlin, Hanover and Hamburg and confiscated a substantial quantity of evidence, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
ARD reported that two KGB agents obtained top-secret computer data from the 
three hackers in exchange for money and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The KGB is believed to have used computer passwords and other information 
obtained from the hackers to penetrate the U.S. Defense Department staff data 
bank OPTIMIS and U.S. military supply depot computers, ARD said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Penetrations 
</P>
<P>
It also was suspected that the Soviets penetrated computers of the West 
European nuclear research center CERN in Geneva; the European Space Agency; the 
Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, West Germany; the 
French arms and electronics company Thomson, and other West European and 
Japanese electronics companies, ARD said. 
</P>
<P>
It said the hackers are believed to have helped the Soviets obtain access to 
Western technology for manufacturing silicon chips, which are the central 
components of modern computers. 
</P>
<P>
The group of hackers first met in Hanover in 1985, ARD said. Later they began 
cooperating with two KGB agents, at first freely and later under pressure and 
threats from the Soviets, it said.

W. EUROPEANS TO BAN GASES DESTROYING OZONE LAYER

<P>
European Community environment ministers Thursday agreed on a surprise pact to 
virtually eliminate household gases used in refrigerators and spray cans that 
are destroying the Earth's protective ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
A community spokesman said the ministers have agreed to eliminate 
chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) production and consumption by the year 2000 and to 
impose an 85% cut as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William K. Reilly 
called on the White House to adopt a policy seeking to end the use of 
ozone-depleting chemicals by the end of the century. (Story, Page 15.) 
</P>
<P>
"This is a quantum leap forward," Lord Caithness, a senior official in the 
British Environment Ministry, told reporters. The ministers had originally 
expected to agree on an 85% cut by the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement would apply to CFCs covered by a treaty signed in Montreal in 
1987, but this excluded a number of other CFCs as well as environmentally 
dangerous halon gases used in fire-fighting equipment. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 countries, including the United States, agreed at Montreal to halve 
the production of CFC production by 1998. Diplomats said the 12-nation European 
Community wanted to take the lead in pushing the world toward total cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a global problem," said French Environment Minister Brice Lalonde. "It's 
important to get the rest of the world behind us as the EC only accounts for 
half the problem." 
</P>
<P>
The European Community produces 400,000 metric tons of CFCs a year out of the 
world's total output of 1.1 million tons. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists say it is vital to eliminate CFC and halon production as soon 
as possible because damage already inflicted on the ozone layer will take 
decades to reverse. 
</P>
<P>
"No delay can be afforded. Depletion of the planet's protective ozone layer is 
an unprecedented global threat to life on Earth," the Greenpeace 
environmentalist organization said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
London Conference Set 
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is staging a 100-nation conference on 
the ozone layer in London next week. Diplomats say a major objective is to 
persuade major producers such as India and China to at least sign the Montreal 
protocol. 
</P>
<P>
"We are talking about millions of people who have refrigerators stuffed with 
CFCs which will be exploded into the atmosphere when the fridges are thrown 
away," one diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
Signatories of the Montreal accord will meet in Helsinki in May to consider 
ways of toughening the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Some developing countries have been reluctant to agree to cuts for fear their 
budding industries will suffer and make them rely on the West for CFC 
substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
CFCs are used as coolants in refrigerators and air-conditioning systems, in 
some spray cans, and for cleaning micro-electronic circuits. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists blame the release of CFCs into the atmosphere for the depletion of 
the ozone layer, which helps shield the Earth from the sun's harmful 
ultra-violet rays. Unfiltered, the rays can cause skin cancer and damage plant 
life. 
</P>
<P>
CFCs are also branded as a major cause of the "greenhouse effect," or heating 
up of the Earth's atmosphere. Scientists say this could change weather patterns 
with disastrous consequences over large parts of the globe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Compounds Banned 
</P>
<P>
Several countries, including the United States, have banned the use of the 
compounds in aerosol propellants. 
</P>
<P>
Over the Antarctic, an ozone hole -- an area where ozone has been seriously 
depleted -- is worsening, according to the British government's Stratospheric 
Ozone Review Group. The group reported that ozone concentration was reduced by 
more than 95% in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
An international expedition warned in February that the atmosphere over the 
Arctic region is also primed for a large destruction of ozone. 
</P>
<P>
Producers of foam plastic trays for grocery stores and containers for fast food 
restaurants are the first to be heavily affected by the worldwide campaign 
against CFCs. Business, Page 1.

U.S. SECRECY KEEPS CLOUD OF DOUBT OVER MENGELE DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly four years after remains unearthed from a Brazilian cemetery were 
identified as those of Dr. Josef Mengele, the notorious Auschwitz death camp 
doctor, the U.S. government refuses to close its books and make public its 
final report on the case. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations has rejected requests 
by a Holocaust survivors group and by the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los 
Angeles to release the lengthy report under the federal Freedom of Information 
Act. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed," said Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Wiesenthal Center, who 
believes the remains are those of Mengele. "Keeping the report a secret 
perpetuates a conspiracy theory." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, fueled in part by government secrecy, theories persist that Mengele may 
still be alive. 
</P>
<P>
Those who subscribe to this view say the bones dug up from a cemetery near Sao 
Paulo, Brazil, in 1985 and examined by six renowned forensic experts were not 
those of Mengele after all, but were part of an elaborate hoax. 
</P>
<P>
The experts, however, insist that the evidence is clear: Mengele died in 1979 
and those are his bones. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who dispute the experts are: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal, who once agreed with the experts but who now 
says, "I see the whole matter of Mengele in absolutely another light. . . . It 
was too perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Menachem Russek, chief Nazi war crimes investigator for the Israeli 
government, who reportedly has written a 60-page memorandum contending that the 
experts who examined the remains were misled by a sophisticated 
sleight-of-hand. Like the United States, the Israeli government has kept its 
casebook on Mengele open and has refused to make its report public. 
</P>
<P>
Wiesenthal, in public, and Russek, in private, point to a meeting that is said 
to have taken place in Bavaria in 1982 at the home of Dr. Hans Munch, a Mengele 
associate at Auschwitz. Present were Mengele's longtime friend and courier, 
Hans Sedlmeier, and a Mengele nephew, Dieter Mengele. 
</P>
<P>
At the gathering -- which occurred three years after Mengele's family said he 
had died -- Sedlmeier asked Munch what would happen if Mengele turned himself 
in to authorities, according to an intelligence source account of the meeting 
provided to the United States, Israel and West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"That does not fit into the logical conclusions" about Mengele's reported 
death, said Hans-Eberhard Klein, who heads the Bonn government's investigation 
of the case. Klein said Munch and Sedlmeier were questioned about the meeting, 
but he declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany, however, is eager to resolve the matter. In a telephone interview 
from his Frankfurt office, Klein told The Times that he has invited Russek and 
Neal Sher, head of the Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations, 
to meet with him in Frankfurt the week of March 20 in an effort to sort out the 
Mengele controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Klein also disclosed that he is considering trying to use a new DNA genetic 
"fingerprinting" test to determine if the skeleton is Mengele's. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sample of Cells 
</P>
<P>
The new technique relies on the fact that everyone's DNA (deoxyribonucleic 
acid), the biologic makeup of genes, is unique. To make a "fingerprint," 
scientists take a sample of cells from an organism -- a single hair or a bone 
-- and then extract the DNA for analysis. 
</P>
<P>
Klein talked of taking "bones, parts of teeth or hair roots," taken from the 
remains disinterred in Brazil and now in the hands of German forensic experts, 
and analyzing them with a view toward determining if genetic tests can be 
performed. 
</P>
<P>
Although he said he has "no great doubt" that Mengele is dead, Klein said that 
if Simon Wiesenthal and the Israelis "have serious doubts, then I will 
investigate them." 
</P>
<P>
The OSI's Sher, who also believes that Mengele died in Brazil, declined to 
discuss in any detail why he will not close the case and make public his 
report, except to suggest that diplomatic considerations are among his reasons. 
He would not elaborate. In the meantime, the ghost of Josef Mengele, the 
infamous "Angel of Death," lives on. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Born in Bavaria 
</P>
<P>
Born in 1911 in the small Bavarian community of Gunzburg, Mengele was the 
eldest of three sons of Karl and Walburga Mengele. His father prospered in the 
farm machinery business and, today, Karl Mengele &amp; Sons is the town's 
primary employer and one of West Germany's largest firms. 
</P>
<P>
After studying philosophy at Munich University, Mengele went to Frankfurt where 
he studied medicine. Attracted to Adolf Hitler's racial purity theories, he 
joined the Nazi party and, at 22, was on the staff of the Institute of 
Hereditary Biology and Race Research. 
</P>
<P>
According to the records of the Wiesenthal Center, in 1939 Mengele joined the 
Waffen SS, the military arm of the Schutzstaffel, which had been formed as 
Hitler's personal bodyguard. In 1943, he was promoted to captain and appointed 
chief medical officer at the Auschwitz prisoner camp in southern Poland. 
</P>
<P>
By any historical measure, Auschwitz was a ghastly killing ground. Although 
exact numbers will never be available, about 4 million men, women and children 
-- the vast majority Jews -- were systematically exterminated at the camp 
through gassing, shooting, lethal injections and disease. Piles of corpses were 
burned daily in the camp's crematoria. 
</P>
<P>
It was Mengele, according to survivor accounts, who often met the cattle 
car-like trains filled with prisoners. Standing at attention and immaculately 
dressed in his SS uniform, he would wait on Auschwitz's train ramp as the cars 
unloaded and, with a flick of his index finger to the right or left, determined 
who would live and who would die. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Twins a Passion 
</P>
<P>
Twins, however, were another matter -- and Mengele's passion. Survivors recall 
him yelling, "Zwillinge, zwillinge" ("twins, twins"), as he sought to cull 
young twins from their mothers. It was on these twins that Mengele performed 
some of his most horrific experiments in the name of genetic engineering in his 
quest to produce a super Aryan race. 
</P>
<P>
In the prison camp's archives, there are accounts of children being strapped to 
operating tables while Mengele probed their inner organs, injected their bodies 
with chemicals and pierced their eyes with dyes in an attempt to change their 
color. Survivors recall times when he treated them kindly, as if they were his 
own children, but they say there was no telling when he would execute a twin on 
the spot with the same emotion as swatting a fly. 
</P>
<P>
After the war, he was briefly in American hands but was released, a subject 
that reportedly takes up part of the still-secret U.S. report. Mengele's 
postwar odyssey ultimately took him to several South American countries, 
including Argentina, Paraguay and, finally, Brazil. It was in the Sao Paulo 
area, where, for about 25 years, he lived under an assumed name in the secret 
care of two European-born couples -- Wolfram and Liselotte Bossert and Gitta 
and Geza Stammer. 
</P>
<P>
By 1985, Mengele's memory burned only in the minds of death camp survivors and 
a handful of Nazi-hunters. But on Jan. 27 of that year, he was suddenly thrust 
into prominence as Auschwitz's survivors roamed the camp's frozen, wind-swept 
ground, marking the 40th anniversary of its liberation by the Soviet army. 
</P>
<P>
As the still-standing wooden watch towers, the red-brick barracks, the 
underground torture cells, the gas chambers and the crematoria came into view 
on television screens around the world, a crescendo of public opinion demanded: 
"Where is Mengele? Why hasn't he been arrested?" 
</P>
<P>
The following month, U.S. Atty. Gen. William French Smith ordered the Justice 
Department to make a determined effort to find Mengele. Leading the search was 
Sher's Office of Special Investigations. The bounty for capturing Mengele 
jumped to several million dollars with new reward money offered by West 
Germany, Israel and private donors, such as the Wiesenthal Center. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on May 31, 1985, a surprise raid by West German police on the Gunzburg 
home of Hans Sedlmeier uncovered letters and documents leading authorities to 
the Bosserts and the Stammers in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
The Bosserts led Brazilian police to Grave 321 at the Embu Cemetery near Sao 
Paulo, declaring that Mengele had drowned at a nearby beach on Feb. 7, 1979. To 
cover his identity, investigators were told, Mengele had been buried under the 
name of Wolfgang Gerhard, a Nazi who had befriended him and who died in Austria 
in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
U.S., Brazilian and West German experts proceeded to authenticate the skeleton 
along with photographs and handwriting samples found at Mengele's Brazilian 
hideaways. The chain of evidence, in their opinion, was complete. In a June, 6, 
1985, report, they declared: 
</P>
<P>
" . . . The exhumed remains are definitely not those of Wolfgang Gerhard. It is 
further our opinion that this skeleton is that of Josef Mengele within a 
reasonable scientific certainty." 
</P>
<P>
The document was signed by three consultants hired by the Justice Department: 
Ali Z. Hameli, chief medical examiner for the state of Delaware; Ellis R. 
Kerley, now-retired anthropology professor at the University of Maryland, and 
Dr. Lowell J. Levine, forensic odontology consultant for the New York State 
Police. 
</P>
<P>
Also signing were three experts hired by the Wiesenthal Center: Dr. John J. 
Fitzpatrick, chairman of the radiology division at Cook County Hospital in 
Chicago; Dr. Leslie Lukash, chief medical examiner of Nassau County, N.Y.; and 
Clyde Collins Snow, forensic anthropology consultant to the Oklahoma state 
medical examiner's office. 
</P>
<P>
In recent interviews with The Times, all six said they were as sure today as 
they were in June, 1985, when they told journalists that the skeleton was 
Mengele's. 
</P>
<P>
"Scientifically," Hameli said, "it couldn't have been" a hoax. "As far as I am 
concerned, Mengele is dead." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, all six expressed surprise when informed that the Justice Department 
had not closed the case. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me," Snow said, "unless there's something new, it's time for 
someone to come to a conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
Among their decisive points in identifying Mengele was a photographic 
comparison in which pictures of the exhumed skull were matched on a video 
terminal to known photos of Mengele from his Nazi SS file, compiled in 1938. 
</P>
<P>
Also matched was a comparison by West German experts of features of Mengele's 
SS photos and what was believed to be Mengele's picture on a 1956 passport 
application in Argentina and a picture Wolfram Bossert had taken of the man who 
lived in his house between 1975 and 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, a 30-page report on the skeletal remains underscored that 
although 29 bones were missing (the normal human skeleton has 206 bones), there 
were still too many similarities to Mengele's physical characteristics for the 
remains to be someone else's. 
</P>
<P>
For example, according to the report, Mengele's records showed that he stood 
5-feet 8 1/2-inches tall, or 174 centimeters, when measured in October, 1938. 
Height calculations from the skeleton performed by Snow and Kerley ranged 
between 167.5 centimeters to 179.4 centimeters, with an estimate of 173.5 
centimeters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Determination of Age 
</P>
<P>
A bone analysis to determine age, conducted by Kerley, resulted in "a 86.7% 
probability that the age of this individual at death was between 64.25 and 
74.25 years and that the most probable age at death was 69.25 years," according 
to a copy of the report in the Wiesenthal Center archives. When he reportedly 
drowned, Mengele would have been nearly 68. 
</P>
<P>
Examination of the skull, which had only 10 remaining teeth, showed that the 
dead man had a wide gap between his upper front teeth before their removal -- 
similar to a gap that was shown clearly in a 1938 SS photo of a smiling 
Mengele. 
</P>
<P>
For OSI's Sher, though, there was still ground to be covered. 
</P>
<P>
Two months after the Embu Cemetery findings, he told a congressional panel that 
based on the experts' conclusions, "I am convinced" the remains are Mengele's. 
But, privately, he knew there were doubts -- especially in Israel, a nation 
with a substantial population of death camp survivors who had an emotional 
stake in the Mengele case. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, Sher said, he believed that if Mengele's dental X-rays could 
somehow be recovered, they would be as good as fingerprints and would be final 
proof that the Embu remains were indeed those of the death camp doctor. 
</P>
<P>
As forensic odontology consultant Levine recalled, the problem was that "the SS 
dental record was not sufficiently specific to allow positive identification" 
of the remains. "It just showed what teeth were filled" and contained no 
X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diplomat's Investigation 
</P>
<P>
That is when Stephen Dachi, the U.S. consul general in Sao Paulo in 1985 and a 
dental expert in his own right, came into the picture. After the experts had 
packed their bags and left Sao Paulo, Sher turned to Dachi and asked him to 
further investigate the case. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, in what was purported to be one of Mengele's diaries, Dachi 
discovered that the writer had told of receiving root canal and upper molar 
work by a Brazilian dentist in a town next to Sao Paulo in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery excited Dachi because handwriting experts had already 
authenticated the Mengele diary notes. Ultimately, Dachi said, "that was the 
key to the whole question" -- the vital link to the X-rays. "We were 100% sure 
the writing in the diary was Mengele's," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with this information, Dachi located the Brazilian dentist, who had a 
dental chart belonging to a Pedro Hochbichler, a Mengele alias. Hochbichler had 
been referred to a nearby dentist and his X-rays turned up in that dentist's 
files. 
</P>
<P>
Odontology consultant Levine, in a telephone interview from his office in New 
York State Police headquarters in Albany, said the X-rays "matched up 
perfectly" with dental X-rays he had taken of the skull found at Embu. "They 
matched up with the person named Wolfgang Gerhard," the name under which 
Mengele had been buried, he said. 
</P>
<P>
If the remains exhumed at Embu were part of a hoax, Levine concluded, a Mengele 
"clone" was in the grave. 
</P>
<P>
But troubling the critics -- and evidently irksome to Sher -- are other events 
linked to Mengele's medical history. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Sher sent a Smithsonian Institution anthropologist, Donald J. Ortner, 
to Brazil to examine the exhumed remains for evidence of osteomyelitis, a bone 
disease from which Mengele suffered as a teen-ager, according to Waffen SS 
records. 
</P>
<P>
Because there was no antibiotic to combat the disease at that time, Ortner knew 
that osteomyelitis could leave bone scars. But Ortner could not find an obvious 
trace of the infection. "The clear evidence wasn't there," he recently 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Until this day, the Mengele family of Gunzburg has never asked Brazil for the 
remains, only serving to further fuel suspicions of the skeptics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Group of Survivors 
</P>
<P>
One of these doubters, Eva Mozes Kor, of Terre Haute, Ind., an Auschwitz 
survivor who, as a twin, was one of Mengele's guinea pigs, has devoted much of 
her life to searching for the Auschwitz doctor. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Kor formed a group called CANDLES -- Children of Auschwitz Nazi Deadly 
Lab Experiments Survivors -- consisting of twins who had been Mengele's 
subjects. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, she filed a Freedom of Information Act request seeking OSI's final 
Mengele report. Last fall, the Justice Department responded: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Report Issued 
</P>
<P>
"To date, the United States has not issued a forensic report which either 
accepts or rejects the premise that the body located in Brazil was that of 
Mengele. . . . The Department has reached no final determination with respect 
to Mengele. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Simon Wiesenthal says he has information about "a new possible 
man in a South American country. They say this is Mengele." He would not 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
The OSI's Sher said he is proud of the way his office conducted itself during 
the Mengele hunt. "This office has earned a reputation all over the world as 
being professional and aggressive in pursuing Nazis," he said. "There's no 
person more eager to get his hands on a live Josef Mengele than me." 
</P>
<P>
But given the preponderance of evidence declaring that Mengele is dead, he 
said, "I don't think it's fair to survivors . . . to inflict on them false 
hope. . . . That would be cruel." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about Wiesenthal's new hoax theory, Rabbi Hier said he respects the 
Nazi-hunter's position -- but firmly believes that he is wrong. "Simon is very 
much his own man," Hier said. "He's been that way for 45 years." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing has changed, Hier underscored in an interview. "There has not been 
developed a single solid lead since the reported death (of Mengele) by any 
authority in the world," he said. "I think that would be the most decisive 
reason to conclude (the case)." 
</P>
<P>
As for the position of some death camp survivors who contend that the wool was 
artfully pulled over the world's eyes, Hier said: 
</P>
<P>
"I find it difficult to accept what CANDLES is saying. . . . (But) maybe they 
are entitled to that hope. They live with these dreams. Mengele is alive in 
them. The Mengele who appears every night in their dreams, he has become a 
living person even if the scientists tell us he's dead."

JOGGING THE MEMORY; 
</P>
<P>
MAKING THE EYE A BETTER WITNESS 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
One intruder had on a blue backpack. The other was wearing tan slacks. Or was 
it a green backpack and brown slacks? 
</P>
<P>
It happened so quickly -- less than a minute -- that 42 witnesses could not 
agree on such vital details when asked about the robbery two days later through 
conventional police interview techniques. The witnesses had been assembled by 
UCLA psychologists ostensibly to view a slide show. But during the viewing, two 
participants in the experiment barged into the room, turned on the lights and 
made off with the projector. 
</P>
<P>
Then the interviewers changed tactics, with remarkable results. They didn't 
just ask, "What happened?" Rather, they told the witnesses to first recall the 
physical setting and their own frame of mind at the time of the robbery. They 
told the witnesses to omit no detail, no matter how trivial. They told them to 
reconstruct the crime in a variety of orders, not just from start to finish. 
Finally, they told the witnesses to re-create the incident not only from their 
own perspective but also from that of the robbers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Cognitive Interview' 
</P>
<P>
This "cognitive interview" technique, pioneered by UCLA psychologist R. Edward 
Geiselman, elicited up to 35% more details about the crime -- all of them 
accurate and many of them crucial, according to the researchers. 
</P>
<P>
With little notice, psychologists have been developing new and relatively 
simple ways to jog the human memory, raising the potential of making eyewitness 
testimony far more reliable than previously thought possible. 
</P>
<P>
These advances may also prove useful well beyond the world of criminal justice, 
they say. For instance, such memory-enhancing tools can aid public health 
officials in tracing partners of people with venereal diseases, said Ronald 
Fisher, a psychologist at Florida International University. The techniques can 
even help a person locate a missing wallet or keys, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Enhance Recall' 
</P>
<P>
"We've known for a long time how to increase learning, but until now little has 
been known about how to enhance recall," Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
The cognitive interview, in particular, has been adopted by many law 
enforcement agencies, including the FBI, the U.S. Secret Service and the 
Metro-Dade Police Department in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"I really believe in this technique," said John S. Farrell, chief of detectives 
at the Metro-Dade Police Department. "This is a whole different ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
Researchers in Florida and Minnesota have also found that false identifications 
at police lineups can be reduced by as much as half when witnesses view 
suspects one at a time instead of six simultaneously, which is the prevalent 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists elsewhere have shown that memory can be significantly affected -- 
for better and worse -- simply by the way a witness is asked about crime 
details. 
</P>
<P>
These emerging insights are timely because many scientists now believe that 
hypnosis is far less reliable than most people assume. And courts across the 
country, including in California, are placing severe restrictions on its use in 
criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
New ways to increase eyewitness reliability are especially important because 
juries tend to give great weight to eyewitness testimony -- sometimes without 
realizing how unreliable such witnesses can be. 
</P>
<P>
"The confidence of the eyewitness is the most powerful predictor of verdicts," 
said Brian L. Cutler, a Florida International University psychologist. Yet 
research shows that confidence is "only weakly correlated with identification 
accuracy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Cause of Wrongful Conviction' 
</P>
<P>
"Faulty eyewitness testimony, in my opinion, is the major cause of wrongful 
conviction in this country," added Elizabeth F. Loftus, a University of 
Washington psychologist. She estimated that as many as half of such wrongful 
convictions may be due to faulty eyewitness testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Loftus has found in experiments that 18% of mock jurors voted to convict in a 
case involving only circumstantial evidence; but after a positive eyewitness 
identification is introduced, the conviction rate shot up to 72%. 
Interestingly, a third jury voted to convict by nearly the same proportion -- 
68% -- even after it was told that the eyewitness had "very poor vision" and 
was not wearing glasses at the time of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
Any memory-improving techniques would be a welcome addition in the fight 
against crime, especially in places such as California, where many criminal 
cases drag on for years without adjudication. 
</P>
<P>
With every court delay, prosecutors and defense lawyers alike are faced with 
the problem of fading memories on the part of key witnesses, making cases 
increasingly difficult to prosecute or defend. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, in the current Night Stalker murder trial in Los Angeles Superior 
Court, numerous witnesses have been unable to recall potentially important 
details. One woman, who survived a shooting from point-blank range in a 
darkened garage nearly four years earlier, was unable on the witness stand to 
positively identify her assailant, as she had done during pretrial proceedings 
years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
In another much-delayed Los Angeles case involving the 6 1/2-year prosecution 
of Virgil Byers for two fatal drive-by gang shootings, two key eyewitnesses now 
have such conflicting accounts of the killings that they seem to be describing 
entirely different events, Deputy Dist. Atty. Loren Naiman said. 
</P>
<P>
How the human memory process operates is still much debated. Some believe that 
it operates much like a tape recording or video recorder that can be stopped or 
played back, perhaps aided by tools such as hypnosis. Others say memory is an 
incomplete abstraction that can be highly susceptible to distortion. 
</P>
<P>
"Models of the mind in general, and theories of memory specifically, seem to 
follow the latest advances in gadgetry," such as the telephone switchboard or a 
computer, according to Loftus. 
</P>
<P>
She said recollections not only fade with time but also become increasingly 
susceptible to alteration by subsequent information or subtle cues, including 
questions posed by investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Her own research has shown that witnesses to a complex event, such as a crime 
or accident, often make serious mistakes, including misidentifying the color of 
a car, remembering a yield sign where a stop sign had been and even placing 
non-existent items at the scenes, something as conspicuous as a barn. 
</P>
<P>
Such distortions, she added, can cause "ripple" effects that lead to wholesale 
contamination of the original memory. And once such alterations occur, it is 
almost impossible for a witness to retrieve the original memory, Loftus said. 
</P>
<P>
She and other researchers, including Steve Penrod, now at the University of 
Minnesota, have found that the accuracy of identifications is also 
significantly affected by the value of a stolen object. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, research subjects who learn that an offender may be treated severely 
are more likely to make positive identifications than those who learn that the 
offender may be treated mildly. 
</P>
<P>
Other scientists have confirmed in recent experiments that cross-racial 
identifications generally are more difficult than same-race identifications, a 
little-understood phenomenon, according to Cutler. 
</P>
<P>
Another major factor that influences recall is the stress associated with 
witnessing a violent event, which alone can lead to poor retention of details. 
Loftus and others demonstrated this phenomenon in a series of experiments 
involving the viewing of two short films depicting a shooting, one graphically 
violent, the other far less so. 
</P>
<P>
In the violent version, which portrayed a boy being shot in the face, only 5% 
of the viewers could recall the number on the boy's jersey. But almost 28% of 
those who saw the less-graphic version could recall it. 
</P>
<P>
All these findings come at a time when hypnosis is generally falling into 
disrepute as a courtroom tool. 
</P>
<P>
"Hypnosis does not lead to accurate recall," said Dr. Martin T. Orne of the 
University of Pennsylvania. "Indeed, the memories obtained prior to hypnosis 
are considerably more reliable than those obtained during hypnosis." 
</P>
<P>
Hypnosis can induce "pseudo-memories" that can become "extremely dangerous in 
the courtroom" because they can make "honest liars" out of well-meaning 
witnesses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Orne agreed with hypnosis proponents that hypnosis can still be a valid 
investigative tool under certain, limited circumstances, such as when it might 
lead to evidence that can be independently corroborated. 
</P>
<P>
One promising alternative to hypnosis involves research on how police lineups 
can be more effective. Cutler and Penrod, for instance, have found that 
sequential lineups, in which one suspect is viewed at a time, can reduce false 
identifications by 50%. 
</P>
<P>
In their study, published in the Journal of Applied Psychology last May, they 
had hundreds of college students view videotapes of staged robberies. 
Afterward, when the lineup included six suspects appearing simultaneously, 39% 
identified an innocent person. But the error rate dropped by half when the same 
suspects were viewed one at a time. 
</P>
<P>
As a way to enhance accurate identifications, Cutler and Penrod suggest that 
suspects in a lineup be asked to move about and to speak. 
</P>
<P>
These methods may become even more effective if enhanced by the cognitive 
interviews, especially in cases in which suspects wore disguises, the 
scientists found. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the most promising memory-enhancing tool appears to be the cognitive 
interview, a technique developed by UCLA's Geiselman. It already has been 
incorporated into the training programs of the U.S. Secret Service and the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Geiselman has given training sessions on the technique in Chicago 
and throughout California, including to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Other hallmarks of the cognitive interview include asking whether a suspect 
reminds the witness of anyone he or she knows and, if so, why. If a name had 
been mentioned during a crime, a witness is asked to think of the first letter 
by going through the alphabet, and then repeat the process with syllables. 
</P>
<P>
If numbers come into play, a witness is asked whether the number had been high 
or low, and how many digits. Witnesses are also asked about a suspect's speech 
characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
Geiselman and his colleagues have demonstrated the efficacy of the technique in 
numerous experiments, many of them using students at UCLA as well as people 
from all walks of life. 
</P>
<P>
Often, the technique is more effective than taking a witness back to a crime 
scene because such scenes rarely remain unchanged, Geiselman said. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, the interview technique, with further refinements, was 
field-tested by Miami detectives investigating more than 70 actual armed 
robberies in 1988. It produced 50% more details than conventional techniques, 
researchers reported. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Geiselman's latest research also suggests that the technique can help 
witnesses recall license plate numbers, when used in conjunction with a 
license-plate simulation device. 
</P>
<P>
In one study, Geiselman found that witnesses on average were able to recall 
3.85 (out of seven) characters on license plates. Without these tools, study 
subjects could recall only an average of two characters. 
</P>
<P>
Such improvement would dramatically reduce the number of possibilities from 
676,000 license plates to 260, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In other studies related to the cognitive interview, psychologist Martin Safer 
at Catholic University of America in Washington has shown that eyewitnesses are 
able to recall significantly more details when questioned several times within 
the first 48 hours of a crime rather than in just one sitting. He said the 
findings challenge the assumption that witnesses are able to recall all the 
first time around. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Effective, Efficient' 
</P>
<P>
The best thing about the cognitive interview, Geiselman said, is that it is "a 
viable memory-enhancement technique that is effective, efficient and legally 
acceptable." And it is easy to teach; his workshops typically take four to six 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Cutler and Penrod believe that the emerging memory-enhancing experiments 
provide sound justification for courts to allow experts to testify more 
frequently on the unreliability of eyewitness identifications. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to minimize these errors, courts and lawyers must familiarize 
themselves with the developing knowledge base provided by the social sciences," 
Loftus said.

FELANDO WINS FIGHT FOR CLEAR AIR IN ASSEMBLY

<P>
To the cheers and applause of his colleagues, Assemblyman Gerald N. Felando 
(R-San Pedro) on Thursday won his two-year fight to ban smoking on the floor of 
the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
On a voice vote, the Assembly overwhelmingly approved the proposal after 
Felando urged lawmakers to take a step to improve their own health. The 
legislator's appeal was tinged with emotion because Felando, 54, last month 
disclosed that he is being treated for a blood-related cancer. 
</P>
<P>
In the last year, he noted in an interview, at least three other members of the 
80-member Assembly have been treated for various kinds of cancer and two others 
have died. Assemblyman Richard E. Longshore (R-Santa Ana), a heavy smoker, died 
last June of pneumonia and Assemblyman Curtis R. Tucker (D-Inglewood) died last 
October from liver cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Those deaths, Felando suggested, have prompted lawmakers to "be more conscious 
about health and about cancer." 
</P>
<P>
During a brief floor debate, Felando admonished his colleagues: "I think for 
the health of the members of this Assembly and for the visitors who visit us 
every day we ought to ban smoking." 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the ban was approved, freshman Assemblyman Willard H. Murray 
(D-Paramount), who opposed the proposal, crushed out his cigarette, cracking, 
"We're ruled by the tyranny of the majority." 
</P>
<P>
But Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd (D-Carson), one of a handful of smokers in the 
Assembly, kept right on puffing on his cigarette. "If I slip sometimes, I guess 
they can have me arrested," he groused to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Felando, a dentist, said he quit smoking in 1962. When he began pushing the 
prohibition in 1987, he maintained that the air quality in the Assembly chamber 
was "hazardous to everyone's health." 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1987, Assembly members ducked taking action on Felando's proposed 
smoking curb in the chamber, but had no hesitation about voting to ban smoking 
on public transportation in California. 
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, the right of lawmakers to smoke has not been restricted. Cliff 
Berg, executive officer of the Senate Rules Committee, said the upper chamber's 
members have informally discussed establishing a smoking section, but have not 
considered an outright ban. 
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by his victory, Felando said Thursday he now may seek to prohibit 
smoking in the entire Capitol.

HEARINGS PLANNED ON BORDER DITCH; 
</P>
<P>
BACKERS FEAR THAT GROWING OPPOSITION COULD DERAIL PROJECT 
</P>

<P>
Growing opposition to a ditch to be constructed along the U.S.-Mexican border 
in San Diego has led to plans for congressional hearings on the project and 
prompted concerns among supporters that it may be derailed. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) has written letters to Secretary of State James A. 
Baker III and to a key House subcommittee chairman, noting that the Mexican 
government has registered opposition to the planned project. "In the interest 
of positive U.S.-Mexican relations," Bates wrote, the State Department should 
"intervene in this matter immediately." 
</P>
<P>
In his letter to Rep. George W. Crockett Jr. (D-Mich.), chairman of the Foreign 
Affairs Committee's subcommittee on Western Hemisphere affairs, Bates requested 
hearings "on U.S.-Mexico relations as soon as possible," urging that the 
hearings be broadened to include the idea of a free-trade zone near the border, 
security matters and other bilateral issues. 
</P>
<P>
In response, Crockett said he has instructed his staff to schedule hearings 
this spring. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to elevate the whole question of border issues to a higher level," 
Bates said in an interview, asserting that discussion of such issues usually 
degenerates into hostile accusations, leaving participants in "a quagmire." 
</P>
<P>
The Immigration and Naturalization Service's plan to build the five-foot-deep, 
four-mile-long concrete and earthen ditch has been the center of controversy 
since it was revealed in January. The agency has commissioned an environmental 
impact study for the ditch, which would cost the United States $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
INS officials assert that the ditch would assist drainage in the Otay Mesa area 
and help stop the frequent passage of vehicles carrying smuggled immigrants and 
drugs across the border. But many immigrant rights activists charge that the 
ditch would be as symbolically offensive as the Berlin Wall in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 20, the Mexican government formally protested the project, declaring: 
"In the spirit of cooperation and friendship that characterizes the relations 
between the two nations, that option (the ditch) must be discarded." 
</P>
<P>
At the State Department an official said the agency is still coordinating a 
response to the Mexican government. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the avalanche of criticism, INS officials Thursday continued to defend 
the plan and stood firm on it. "It makes sense," said INS spokesman Duke 
Austin, "because it addresses border drainage concerns and protects Mexican 
nationals from injury by high-speed entrance to the United States. It makes 
sense on both sides." 
</P>
<P>
However, there is a rising concern among advocates of the ditch that because of 
the mounting criticism, it may never be built. 
</P>
<P>
This concern centers on the possibility that the State Department, thinking of 
the international image of the United States, will order the project halted. "I 
do see the State Department coming down real hard, because opponents are 
screaming," said one Bush Administration official. 
</P>
<P>
Asked when the department will reply to Mexican complaints, one State 
Department official said, "It'll happen; there's still time. Not a single 
shovel has been turned on the project." 
</P>
<P>
The INS environmental impact study is expected to be completed by April. 
Officials have said they hope the ditch can be built this summer. 
</P>
<P>
But an official at the Justice Department, parent agency of the INS, said that 
if the environmental assessment is overwhelmingly favorable but contains "just 
one negative sentence," the project might be killed. "If you're looking for a 
reason not to do something, you can always find it," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
The planned congressional hearings may only complicate its fate. 
</P>
<P>
"I agree that such a hearing is necessary," Crockett said in a letter replying 
to Bates' request. 
</P>
<P>
At the Mexican Embassy here, a spokesman hailed the planned hearings as 
"fantastic." He said they will be "extremely positive" if they lead to 
increased attention to bilateral issues. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Martha Jimenez of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational 
Fund, while assailing the ditch as an example of "isolation mentality," said 
the hearings "should go beyond the ditch and get at core problems like fear and 
intolerance and see how we as a nation have been sensitive to immigrants. They 
should deal with reasons that people are trying to come here."

BUDDHIST SECT ALARMED BY REPORTS THAT LEADER KEPT HIS AIDS A SECRET 
</P>

The biggest branch of Tibetan Buddhism in America has been stunned with reports 
that its spiritual leader, whose homosexual activity was known to the 
movement's insiders, has been infected with the AIDS virus since 1985 but did 
not acknowledge the problem until last December when a companion was also found 
to be infected. 
</P>
<P>
Called by one official a "tragic catastrophe" in ethics, the scandal 
surrounding Ozel Tendzin, 45, American-born regent of the international 
Vajradhatu Buddhist organization, has been compounded by his recent decision to 
resume teaching and ceremonial duties in defiance of a request by the 
movement's board. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On Retreat in La Jolla 
</P>
<P>
Tendzin went on retreat early this month at a private residence in La Jolla. 
Though he described his situation in special mid-December meetings at Berkeley 
and Los Angeles, several members said he was vague about his condition and why 
he did not alert others. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to senior officials of the sect confirmed in interviews that a 
male companion of Tendzin and a woman friend of the young man have tested 
positive for the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
"All we know is who slept with whom and that all three have tested positive for 
HIV," said one source, referring to the human immunodeficiency virus that leads 
to AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Some knowledgeable sect members are outraged by the situation. Lisa Goldblatt, 
coordinator of the Portland, Ore., study group and a board member of an Oregon 
AIDS coalition, wrote to other Vajradhatu leaders Dec. 31 that a "grave 
mistake" was made in not informing the organization about the regent's 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
"The results of this situation -- a tragic catastrophe -- are that individuals 
have been infected and will die. Our community is seriously injured and even 
the dharma (Buddhist teaching) in the West has been marred," Goldblatt said in 
a letter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Membership of 3,500 
</P>
<P>
"All this would not have happened if the regent or his colleagues had informed 
our sangha (community) in 1985, which was the only responsible action to take. 
That the regent has AIDS is tragic," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The Vajradhatu network of about 35 meditation centers in North America and 
Europe has about 3,500 members. It was founded in 1970 in Boulder, Colo., by 
the Venerable Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche, who named Tendzin as his successor 
before he died in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Though rather traditional in doctrinal teaching, the two leaders were not 
celibate monks as is common in Tibetan and other Buddhist branches. Both 
Trungpa and Tendzin married but engaged in other sexual liaisons -- a practice 
that is not considered immoral in the organization. 
</P>
<P>
The Vajradhatu movement has been influential in the spread of Buddhism among 
Caucasians. It was a principal founder of the fledgling American Buddhist 
Congress and also publishes a newspaper read widely by Buddhists and edited in 
Boulder by Rick Fields, a popular historian of U.S. Buddhism. 
</P>
<P>
In its latest, long-delayed issue, the Vajradhatu Sun newspaper depicts a 
transparent broken heart drawn over the sect's logo -- symbolizing the disorder 
and impasse evident in the organization. Accompanying the drawing was a 
statement, which one reader called "pathetic," that the regent and the board 
have prohibited the newspaper from reporting on its dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
Tendzin went into retreat without responding to the request by the Vajradhatu 
board to withdraw from duties for an indefinite period. 
</P>
<P>
Vajradhatu is part of the India-based Kagyu tradition -- one of four wings -- 
of Tibetan Buddhism. The regents of Kagyu had also advised Tendzin to withdraw 
for the sake of harmony and avoiding "negativity" toward Buddhism, according to 
a Vajradhatu board document dated Jan. 10. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Attended by Physician 
</P>
<P>
Tendzin, at times said to be "very sick," apparently has hoped he could improve 
his health while on retreat. The San Francisco Chronicle and the Boulder Camera 
quoted from a Jan. 17 letter the newspapers said Tendzin wrote to his 
followers, saying, "In working with disease, dharma (Buddhist teaching) is the 
best medicine." 
</P>
<P>
A one-time disciple of Trungpa Rinpoche who is close to senior Vajradhatu 
officials said he was told Tendzin is being attended by specialists in "the 
healing arts" but no medical doctor. A board member confirmed that no physician 
is with Tendzin but declined to elaborate or say where in La Jolla the regent 
is staying. 
</P>
<P>
In his Jan. 17 letter, Tendzin was oblique about his culpability, referring to 
the "faults of myself and others. . . ." The Chronicle said a person who was at 
the Berkeley meeting with Tendzin said the regent apologized for his ignorance, 
saying that "he somehow believed that he and the people in contact with him 
were protected from AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
In telephone calls last week to various leaders, Tendzin said that after he 
ends his three-month retreat, he will resume teaching and perform the abhisheka 
ceremony. That "empowerment" rite, in which advanced students are said to get a 
glimpse of the "enlightened" mind, is scheduled May 16 at the organization's 
contemplative center near Barnet, Vt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Painful Point' 
</P>
<P>
If Tendzin does insist on doing the ceremony, "that would force things to a 
painful point," said an influential figure in the organization who spoke on the 
condition of anonymity. "Some people on the board hoped it would be a long 
leave," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Vajradhatu board, based in Halifax, Nova Scotia, has declined to say what 
its next step will be. It has repeatedly refused to confirm or deny that 
Tendzin has a health problem, citing in a statement Friday that "overriding 
principles of medical confidentiality" were at stake. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in general terms the statement also said, "Although there have been a 
few cases of HIV infection among our worldwide membership, the number of cases 
is in fact lower than would be expected" in a group of its size. Members who 
fear they are at risk were advised to be tested for the virus, the statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Martin Janowitz, in a telephone interview, denied speculation 
within the movement that the board fears it may be held liable for Tendzin's 
actions. He said there was no concern, despite the $21.75-million award this 
month by a Los Angeles jury to Marc Christian, a lover of Rock Hudson who said 
the late actor did not tell him he was dying of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Tendzin, who was born Thomas F. Rich in Passaic, N.J., has a wife and children 
living in Halifax, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that he made love to men and women outside of wedlock," said an East 
Coast source. A Los Angeles center member who did want to be identified said, 
"(Tendzin's) bisexuality has been considered an open secret for as long as I've 
known him, since 1974." Another Los Angeles member, interviewed separately, 
concurred: "It is fairly common knowledge that he has had homosexual 
relations." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, homosexual relations are not the issue, said board member Janowitz. "We 
don't have a view within our religion of moral or immoral sexual practices. We 
don't view, as do some other religions, homosexual relations as any kind of 
sin," he said. "If anyone has AIDS, our concern would be for their health." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Show Compassion 
</P>
<P>
Many officials in the organization, reluctant to comment at all, mostly say 
they want to show Buddhist compassion to Tendzin and preserve the unity of the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"His actions have caused a lot of pain, chaos and confusion. (But) people are 
working with the situation and practicing more than ever now," said Marcy Fink, 
a Vajradhatu representative in Los Angeles. "There is a lot of chaos, and it 
would be silly to deny it." She added that none of the 100 members of the Los 
Angeles center have quit. 
</P>
<P>
Some Vajradhatu members, however, have sought the counsel of the Buddhist AIDS 
Project in Los Angeles. Recent events "have caused a great deal of pain and 
questioning for many people," Steve Peskind and Ken McLeod, the project's 
coordinator and spiritual adviser, respectively, said in a joint statement.

for AIDS virus. A translucent heart, below, was superimposed over logo of 
sect's newspaper, Vajradhatu Sun, to symbolize sadness and turmoil from

wishes of other leaders by returning to leadership activities. The newspaper 
has been prevented from reporting on the situation.

DROUGHT EXPERTS SAY RAIN IS ONLY A DROP IN BUCKET 
</P>

<P>
As a major storm swept across Northern California, providing a glimmer of hope 
for relief from drought, state and federal officials warned Thursday that at 
least five more just like it are needed to ease a three-year siege. 
</P>
<P>
The storm soaked the Sierra and Central Valley just as officials were releasing 
figures showing a near bone-dry February had exacerbated the drought. 
</P>
<P>
"February was very disappointing," said Maurice Roos, chief of hydrology for 
the state Department of Water Resources. "We're all smiles today to see the 
kind of storm that we had (but) we're going to need about five more to get us 
really out of the woods this year." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Horrible, Just Terrible' 
</P>
<P>
State officials reported that rainfall in February, a critical rain month, was 
40% of normal in their tracking areas. In the areas that feed federal 
reservoirs, officials gauged it at a "horrible, just terrible" 18% of normal. 
</P>
<P>
To maintain water deliveries to urban and farming areas supplied by the federal 
and state governments, officials said March would have to produce double the 
normal precipitation. Federal officials, who predict that the chances of 
sustained heavy downpours are slim, have already begun cutting back deliveries 
to Central Valley farmers and some Northern California cities served by federal 
water projects. 
</P>
<P>
William J. Helms, drought response coordinator for the state Water Resources 
Department, said his agency will decide by May 1 -- the official end of this 
rainy season -- if it needs to order cutbacks. In that case, he said water 
deliveries to agricultural regions will be reduced by 40% and there will be no 
reductions to cities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Classified as Critical' 
</P>
<P>
"All this still hinges on what happens -- how much rainfall we're going to 
get," he said. "Even if we do get enough water to make our deliveries, the 
water year will still be classified as critical because it won't have restored 
the reservoirs." 
</P>
<P>
He said the three-year drought, the first in 400 years of such long duration, 
had continued to siphon away reservoir reserves. At the beginning of 1987, the 
state's reservoirs were full because of an exceptionally wet season in 1986. By 
the beginning of 1988, they were 93% of normal. At the end of February this 
year, they had dropped to 65% of normal. 
</P>
<P>
Both state and federal officials said the problems in 1988 were heightened not 
only by a smaller amount of rainfall but an even lower level run-off to feed 
reserves. When soil is dry, they noted, it absorbs most of the rainfall, 
leaving little run-off to replenish reservoirs. At the same time, they said, 
the dry powdery snow in the Sierra that produced wonderful skiing conditions 
had a below-normal water content. 
</P>
<P>
Roos said he is still hoping that rainfall in March can prevent water delivery 
cutbacks. He said the latest storm had produced about three inches of rain in 
the Sacramento Valley, soaking the soil mantle so that any additional storm 
will produce a heavy run-off. He said another storm system is expected to hit 
the area Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the best thing we've seen this year as a single storm. Now we're hoping 
and praying we get a couple of follow-ups in the next week or 10 days," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But John B. Budd, a spokesman for the federal Bureau of Reclamation, did not 
share the state official's optimism. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of things working against being positive about what's going to 
happen the remainder of the year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Three-quarters of the rainy season is already over, he pointed out, and last 
year March, like February, was exceptionally dry. 
</P>
<P>
Cutbacks in water supplied by state and federal governments will not directly 
affect Los Angeles and other cities in Southern California. Los Angeles, 
however, may experience its own shortages because of reduced snowpack in the 
eastern Sierra Nevada, one important source of the city's water.

TALKS WITH POLISH REGIME GIVE SOLIDARITY A LIFT; 
</P>

OUTLAWED TRADE UNION HAS NEW-FOUND LEGITIMACY, BUT PROBLEMS REMAIN

<P>
The Solidarity spokesmen are on television every night, giving their version of 
events. They are interviewed in exhaustive detail, and they provide measured 
analyses of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
The state-run television does not call them Solidarity spokesmen, for the 
movement is still illegal, or at least unofficial. But the spokesmen generally 
hold sheaves of paper or file folders with the union's name clearly in sight. 
</P>
<P>
The matter under examination is the recently opened dialogue, the so-called 
round-table discussions, between the outlawed independent trade union and 
Poland's Communist government. For three weeks now, in almost daily sessions, 
negotiators for the two sides have been meeting in an effort to work out a plan 
for Poland's future. 
</P>
<P>
The plan's details are indistinct, and concrete accomplishment remains distant, 
but the talks have brought about changes that could be difficult to reverse. 
</P>
<P>
The regular, commonplace appearance of Solidarity officials on television -- 
impossible four or five weeks ago -- is an example. Journalists from Poland's 
"unofficial" press, once accurately described as "underground," show up for 
briefings of government spokesman Jerzy Urban and are designated 
"representatives of Lech Walesa's press center." Solidarity negotiators at the 
table are referred to by the government as "Lech Walesa's organizational 
bureau." 
</P>
<P>
In the process, Walesa and the union movement he heads have been legitimized by 
the authorities -- even if official sanction of the movement has yet to be 
announced. It is a calculated gamble on the part of the authorities, who hope 
that Solidarity can be made to share the blame for the country's current mess 
while being deprived of the power to significantly change it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Snags Encountered 
</P>
<P>
The round-table talks have run into snags in recent days as groups discussing 
such issues as youth and the mass media have found themselves in sharp 
disagreement. Working groups discussing the economy and politics have also run 
into obstacles, with the two sides speaking what sometimes seem like different 
languages and pressing toward different goals. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa met Thursday with Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, minister of the interior and 
head of the government delegation at the round-table talks, in an apparent 
effort to smooth out the differences. Neither side made public any details of 
the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
While the talks have gone on, Solidarity activists in factories all over Poland 
have been getting organized and, in some cases, reclaiming offices that were 
occupied by the state-sanctioned unions after Solidarity was outlawed in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
There is a feeling that time is on Solidarity's side, while the government, by 
contrast, is in a race with the calendar and growing public and labor 
discontent. 
</P>
<P>
"The pressure now is on the government," a Solidarity activist said. "They want 
to get something done in the next two weeks because they are afraid of strikes. 
They are also afraid of the students, who are getting more daring and more 
impatient. They want to get elections held as early in the summer as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"On our side, we are interested in agreement, but we know from experience that 
we have to press for every inch. The authorities do not surrender anything 
easily. We have to fight for it. And while the arguing goes on, we get our 
organization in shape and we see the sweat on their foreheads." 
</P>
<P>
Since the talks started, Walesa has been touring the country, talking to youth 
groups and factory workers. Somewhat ostentatiously, he has been preaching 
patience to all audiences, urging activist students to restrain their 
demonstrations and workers to resist striking for higher wages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Are Quickly Settled 
</P>
<P>
Small, sporadic strikes have become an almost daily feature of life in Poland 
in the last six months, most of them quickly settled by grants of more money 
for the workers. And although the threat of large-scale strikes in major 
factories has put pressure on the government, an actual outbreak of strikes 
could shake the Solidarity leadership as well, possibly eroding Walesa's 
moderating influence. 
</P>
<P>
A student demonstration last weekend in Krakow, in which the students ridiculed 
the Soviet Union and wound up in a violent clash with the police, brought 
expressions of concern from both Solidarity and the government. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa, calling for calm, told the students that Poland could be built "only 
through work -- wise, well-organized work." 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in Lodz, Walesa asked: "Is there any other solution besides the 
round-table? What will happen if the agreement doesn't work out? For me, this 
is the question: Shall we go the peaceful way, or shall we break heads with 
stones, as the young ones want?"

DESPITE RIOTS, VENEZUELA WILL STRESS AUSTERITY

CARACAS, Venezuela 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shaken by four days of bloody price riots that left more than 200 dead and 
thousands injured, Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez vowed Thursday to 
stick to the tough austerity measures that triggered the violence and called on 
the industrial nations to work out "decent and rational" debt arrangements with 
Latin America before more such social explosions occur. 
</P>
<P>
Although calm prevailed throughout most of the nation, sporadic disturbances 
continued in the shantytown slums of western Caracas where another 20 people 
reportedly were killed in armed clashes with army troops and police during the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
In one daylight confrontation Thursday, a crowd of about 100 slum-dwellers 
poured down a shantytown hillside, throwing rocks at waiting police who fired 
back with undetermined results. Occasional shots could be heard elsewhere 
throughout the day as police and army marksmen aimed fire at suspected snipers 
on the tops of buildings. 
</P>
<P>
As night fell and the 6 p.m. curfew began, there were prolonged bursts of 
automatic weapons fire in the plush downtown district called Parque Central, 
where the city's cultural center and major hotels are located. 
</P>
<P>
But only a few hours earlier, as he boarded a helicopter to survey the 
strife-torn slums, Perez said that except for the "pockets of disorder" in the 
slums, the country "is returning to normal." 
</P>
<P>
By implication he blamed "remnants" of extreme left revolutionaries for some of 
the disorder. "These phantasmagoric remnants of subversives are still not 
convinced that this is a democratic country," said Perez, who was inaugurated 
only a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
Although many social scientists and foreign diplomats here believe the rioting 
and looting were leaderless and began spontaneously in response to sharp 
government-announced price increases, Perez insisted that at least some acts 
"were induced, and this has to be punished severely." 
</P>
<P>
Emotionally, he described one incident in which army Maj. Felipe Acosta Caries, 
36, was killed in an ambush on the Pan American Highway near the Caracas 
working-class district of El Valle late Wednesday or early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Perez said that he was "preoccupied with and ashamed of" the violence and 
called the heavy loss of life "an absurdity" that happened "without any 
understandable reason." 
</P>
<P>
Economists here said that one of the major reasons for the rioting can be 
traced to the fact that 40% to 50% of the people of Caracas live beneath the 
poverty line of 5,000 bolivars ($143) a month and simply cannot survive the 
price boosts. 
</P>
<P>
Upon returning from his helicopter tour of the capital city, the beleaguered 
president vowed to stand fast with his belt-tightening measures, which included 
substantial increases in the prices of long-subsidized goods. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to keep on with the measures that we have proposed in order to get 
Venezuela out of this economic situation," Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a $33-billion foreign debt burden which his government is trying to 
refinance, Perez called on the major lending countries "to find decent and 
rational formulas in order that Latin America can respect its debt 
commitments." 
</P>
<P>
The alternative, he said, is to "face a grave social situation such as the one 
which provoked the explosion here." 
</P>
<P>
The rigid austerity measures were required as a condition of a new agreement 
with the International Monetary Fund, which was signed in Washington while 
rioters looted stores in Caracas on Tuesday. The agreement will give Venezuela 
an immediate $453 million with another $4.3 billion on tap over the next three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Venezuelan air force moved into its second day of an 
around-the-clock airlift of food to the capital in what may be a futile attempt 
to stave off severe shortages by the weekend. As many as 95% of the grocery 
stores and food markets in some parts of the city were destroyed by looters 
Monday and Tuesday, further exacerbating shortages that had been developing in 
anticipation of price increases. 
</P>
<P>
"This weekend there may be some hunger in the city," said an economist who has 
been following the crisis. He said that even before the rioting, there had been 
sporadic shortages of milk, rice, bread, salt, soap and toilet paper in the 
stores as merchants withheld goods in anticipation of higher prices.

MEXICAN ENVOY ACCUSED OF IGNORING STOCK FRAUD 
</P>

Opposition congressmen are accusing Mexico's ambassador to the United States, 
Gustavo Petricioli, of having "turned a blind eye" on illegal trading in the 
Mexican stock market while he served as secretary of finance in the Cabinet of 
former President Miguel de la Madrid. 
</P>
<P>
The congressmen charge that the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) 
is covering up for Petricioli by blocking their efforts to bring action against 
him for failing to act on complaints that major brokerage houses provoked a 
1987 market crash that wiped out tens of thousands of investors here. 
</P>
<P>
In February, after being in power for less than three months, the government of 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari jailed four prominent stockbrokers for 
alleged irregular operations in the stock market. Officials are said to be 
investigating 152 other brokers. 
</P>
<P>
The jailed brokers, including financier Eduardo Legorreta, who reportedly 
contributed heavily to Salinas' presidential campaign last year, are accused of 
trading expired treasury certificates, buying and selling stock without the 
authorization of their clients and other violations. 
</P>
<P>
"Petricioli knew of these irregularities and allowed them to pass; he turned a 
blind eye," said Ciro Mayen Mayen, a Socialist member of the Chamber of 
Deputies. 
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry issued a statement Feb. 22 saying that Petricioli 
"energetically and categorically rejects the unfounded insinuations that 
authorities of the past government may have been negligent or avoided or 
covered up irregular activities of some stock brokerages and their officials." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Laws Tightened 
</P>
<P>
Petricioli said that the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit took a number of 
steps against brokerage houses from mid-1986 to the end of his term in 
November, 1988. He said the government tightened laws regulating the market and 
initiated the investigation that led the Salinas administration to make the 
arrests. 
</P>
<P>
PRI leaders charge that the opposition is trying to discredit Petricioli 
because of his role in helping to renegotiate Mexico's foreign debt. During 
last year's presidential campaign, the leftist parties called for a moratorium 
on debt payments. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican Socialist Party led the move this week in the Chamber of Deputies 
to charge Petricioli with negligence under a law governing public servants. 
Violation of the law is considered a political rather than criminal offense, 
and the penalty is to be barred from public service. 
</P>
<P>
To support their case, the leftist deputies produced three documents, including 
a May, 1988, report by the Federal Securities Commission recommending that the 
secretary of finance impose sanctions against two firms, including Legorreta's 
house, Operadora de Bolsa, for illegal transactions with treasury certificates. 
</P>
<P>
They also produced a November, 1988, letter from Sergio Garcia Ramirez, who was 
then the attorney general, informing Petricioli of apparently illegal 
activities in the stock market. Enclosed with the letter was a list of 35 
complaints against brokerages. The letter said federal attorneys had informed 
Garcia Ramirez that there was sufficient evidence to file criminal charges. By 
law, the secretary of finance must ask the attorney general to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
Petricioli responded to the letter on Nov. 28, two days before the end of the 
presidential term, saying that stock market operations are complex and that the 
diverse charges require further study. 
</P>
<P>
At the urging of the Mexican Socialist Party, the Chamber of Deputies formed a 
subcommittee to study the case. 
</P>
<P>
A PRI majority on the subcommittee determined that there was not enough 
evidence to charge Petricioli, but the opposition called the PRI resolution 
unilateral and drafted a resolution of its own. The two resolutions are to be 
considered later by the full Constitutional and Judicial Committee, and the PRI 
majority is expected to approve its own resolution.

EPA CHIEF MAKES APPEAL TO WHITE HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
U.S. ACTION URGED TO END CFC USE

Responding to concern about the ozone layer, Environmental Protection Agency 
Administrator William K. Reilly called on the White House on Thursday to adopt 
a policy seeking to end the use of ozone-depleting chemicals by the end of the 
century, according to Administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, made during a meeting of the Domestic Policy Council, came just 
hours after a surprise agreement by members of the European Community to take 
similar action. 
</P>
<P>
If endorsed by President Bush, the move would double the pace at which 
production and consumption of chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs -- the household 
gases that are destroying the Earth's ozone layer -- would be restricted under 
U.S. law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Step in Effort 
</P>
<P>
EPA officials see the proposal as a first step in a wider effort to strengthen 
the Montreal Protocol, an international agreement signed by about 40 nations 
that calls for a 50% reduction in production and consumption of CFCs by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was hailed as historic when it was signed in November, 1987, but 
the discovery since that time that the ozone depletion problem was far worse 
than imagined has led to wide spread concern that the treaty was not 
sufficiently strict. 
</P>
<P>
Since the treaty was signed, scientists have reported that during part of the 
year, the ozone levels in the stratosphere over Antarctica decline by nearly 
50% and that the ozone layer over parts of the Northern Hemisphere have been 
depleted since 1969 by as much as 6%. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, scientists warned last month that accumulations of the man-made 
pollutants high above the North Pole had left the ozone layer in the Arctic 
stratosphere "primed" for destruction. 
</P>
<P>
An EPA official said Thursday night that Reilly hoped for an Administration 
decision on the proposal as early as today, when he leaves for London to attend 
a 100-nation conference. 
</P>
<P>
The talks, headed by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, will deal with 
the threat to the ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
White House approval would give U.S. negotiators attending the meeting a head 
start in seeking revision of the Montreal Protocol, which is due to be 
officially reconsidered for the first time in May at a meeting in Helsinki. 
</P>
<P>
CFCs are used as coolants in refrigerators and air conditioners and as 
propellants in some spray cans. When in the atmosphere, they break down into 
chemical components capable of destroying ozone at a rapid rate. The process is 
exacerbated in the polar regions because of cold temperatures and other 
meteorological characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
Ozone, which is found in the stratosphere between 9 and 15 miles above the 
Earth's surface, shields the planet from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers believe that a mere 1% depletion in the ozone layer can increase 
the risk of skin cancer by 4% to 5%. 
</P>
<P>
At the London meeting, European and U.S. negotiators hope to persuade 
less-developed nations, including China and India, to restrict their CFC 
production. Neither nation has yet signed the Montreal Protocol. 
</P>
<P>
But the European decision Thursday and the Reilly proposal to the White House 
represent decisions by the developed nations to proceed with efforts to end CFC 
production even if other nations do not follow their lead.

Police Thursday began arresting organizers of ethnic Albanian unrest in 
Yugoslavia's turbulent Kosovo Province, and the official news agency Tanjug 
said that former Kosovo party chief Azem Vlasi was among those held. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests followed widespread protests against planned constitutional changes 
that ethnic Albanians fear will limit their autonomy in the southern province, 
bordering Albania. 
</P>
<P>
Tanjug said that Vlasi, one of the most popular Communist Party leaders among 
ethnic Albanians in the province, was arrested along with two directors of a 
mine whose workers' strike helped set off the wave of protests. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-day strike led the Yugoslav State Presidency to clamp a partial state 
of emergency on the province. Troops and tanks were deployed in Kosovo for the 
first time since ethnic Albanian riots in 1981.

REVERSES FOR THATCHER GIVE FOES A RAY OF HOPE

<P>
To the traditional measures of inevitability, death and taxes, a third has in 
recent times been axiomatic in Britain: another election victory for Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher and her Conservative Party. 
</P>
<P>
Now about halfway through a third term, Thatcher has been regarded by most 
political analysts as a shoo-in for a fourth. But in the last week or so, she 
has suffered a series of reverses that some of her political rivals claim give 
them a ray of hope -- although the Tories profess not be worried and are quick 
to explain why. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher's recent reverses began with poor showings in two by-elections to fill 
vacancies in Parliament. In one, the Conservative candidate finished a distant 
third; in the other, the Conservative won but only by an eyelash in a 
constituency that had been considered safe. 
</P>
<P>
Then, last weekend, two public opinion polls showed the Labor Party running 
neck-and-neck with the Conservatives, or even slightly ahead. It was Labor's 
strongest showing in more than two years, wiping out a 10% gap that had existed 
only weeks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The polls showed that a key factor in the swing is disillusionment with 
government economic policy, which has boosted interest rates to their highest 
level in eight years -- 13% on mortgages, for example. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday there was more bad economic news as Britain reported a 
higher-than-expected trade deficit for January. The figures suggested that 
interest rates are still not high enough to dampen consumer spending, and a 
six-column, page one headline in Thursday's Independent newspaper suggested 
what the political implications might be. "Trade Gap Puts Lawson on Trial," it 
said, referring to Nigel Lawson, chancellor of the exchequer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Midterm Patch 
</P>
<P>
Yet a senior Thatcher aide told an interviewer: "I don't think you should worry 
too much about this (the reverses). It's a typical mid-term patch." 
</P>
<P>
To be no worse than even is really a victory at this stage, the aide said, and 
added, "We always thought 1989 would be sticky and difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Many independent analysts agree, pointing to even worse mid-term slumps in 
Thatcher's two previous governments. 
</P>
<P>
"This is nothing," Robert M. Worcester, director of Market &amp; Opinion 
Research International (MORI), said of the poll results. "This is a slight 
cold, whereas before they had pneumonia and still recovered." 
</P>
<P>
The polls showing Labor narrowing the gap were conducted by the Harris and 
Gallup organizations. The results of the next MORI poll are to be published 
this weekend in the Sunday Times of London. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Thatcher's greatest strength is the disarray among her rivals, what 
Peter Jenkins, a columnist for the Independent, referred to this week as "this 
crisis of opposition." 
</P>
<P>
Despite its improved showing in the polls, Labor is still considered by many to 
be unelectable because of the nature of its support and because of Britain's 
electoral system. The party has overwhelming backing in many constituencies but 
seems to be unable to mount a real challenge in the more populous southeast of 
the country, where Thatcher dominates. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two center parties, the Social Democratic Party headed by David Owen 
and the Social and Liberal Democrats, headed by Paddy Ashdown, effectively 
cancel each other out. 
</P>
<P>
In last week's Richmond by-election, a Conservative won with only 37% of the 
vote, while the two centrist parties split 54%. 
</P>
<P>
In the general elections of 1987, the Conservatives won 375 of the 650 seats in 
Parliament with only 42% of the vote. Labor finished second with 30% of the 
vote but only 229 seats. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Tory share isn't below 42% or 43%, then everybody else is whistling in 
the dark," Worcester said. 
</P>
<P>
Ashdown has been pushing for a merger of the two centrist parties in hopes of 
mounting an effective challenge to Thatcher. But Owen notes that this approach 
failed miserably in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Capricious, Whimsical' 
</P>
<P>
Owen advocates a "constitutional coalition" in which the two centrist parties 
and Labor would form an electoral pact to mount a unified, 
constituency-by-constituency attack. But Labor leader Neil Kinnock has rejected 
the idea. He says Owen is "so capricious, so whimsical, so egotistical (that) 
what he says this week might be entirely different next week." 
</P>
<P>
That apparently leaves a revitalized Labor Party as the only potential hope for 
defeating Thatcher. Kinnock, whom some were writing off as party leader as 
recently as last fall, has been more adept lately at capitalizing on 
Conservative weaknesses. His revamped shadow cabinet has hit hard and 
apparently effectively at such controversial government programs as reform of 
the National Health Service and privatization of the utilities. 
</P>
<P>
Kinnock has sharpened his polemics, keeping his parliamentary challenges 
shorter and more to the point than previously, and injecting a touch of humor. 
A source who saw the Labor leader at a party the other night said, "He's really 
feeling extremely bullish." 
</P>
<P>
At this early stage, only the most foolhardy would suggest that it is time to 
begin writing Thatcher's political obituary. Analysts say they will be watching 
three upcoming tests before even acknowledging that the opposition might have a 
chance of ending her domination. 
</P>
<P>
The first will be another by-election, at the Vale of Glamorgan in Wales, and 
it is expected to be hard fought between Labor and the Conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
Next come elections to local government councils -- long a stronghold for Labor 
candidates. And finally there are elections for the European Parliament in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
Given the importance of momentum, one analyst noted, the Conservatives could be 
vulnerable if Labor makes a series of stronger-than-expected showings. 
</P>
<P>
"Then her people could get panicky, start running around and put their foot in 
it," the analyst said.

A needed expansion of the National Crime Information Center will proceed 
without the inclusion of what commonly are called "investigative files," FBI 
Director William S. Sessions wrote Thursday to Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose), 
chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on civil and constitutional 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, who had questioned the proposal to expand the computer network with 
the investigative information, supports the revised FBI plan and said Sessions 
had made the "right decision." 
</P>
<P>
An advisory board representing the 64,000 federal, state and local law 
enforcement agencies using the national crime computers had proposed a year ago 
to expand the system to list suspects. Whenever any law enforcement agency then 
asked about them, the original agency listing them also could be notified. 
</P>
<P>
But computer experts from the Computer Professionals for Social 
Responsibilities -- at Edwards' request -- said last month that the plan would 
turn the crime network "from a public records system . . . into a surveilance 
system." The computer experts, working with the American Civil Liberties Union, 
also said the changes, whose potential benefits they called questionable, would 
"raise serious constitutional issues." 
</P>
<P>
Janlori Goldman, an ACLU attorney, said the group was "thrilled" with Sessions' 
decision. "We think that this reflects (his) sensitivity to privacy and civil 
liberties concerns. There was too much at stake here to move forward," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The federal computer system now lets law enforcement agencies exchange 
information across state lines, handling almost 20 million individual records 
on missing persons, stolen property and criminal histories. It has grown 
substantially from the 300,000 records it had when created in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
The system's expansion, which will cost an estimated $30 million to $40 
million, now will include what Sessions has described as technical 
enhancements.

SENATE CONFIRMS DERWINSKI UNANIMOUSLY FOR VETERANS POST DESPITE 'TIP-OFF' ISSUE 
</P>

<P>
The Senate Thursday unanimously confirmed Edward J. Derwinski to be the first 
head of the Cabinet-level Department of Veterans' Affairs despite his admitted 
1977 mistake in tipping off South Korea that one of its intelligence agents was 
about to defect to U.S. authorities. The vote was 94 to 0. 
</P>
<P>
Derwinski acknowledged that it was "rather stupid" of him to inform a South 
Korean diplomat of the impending defection of the agent amid the Capitol Hill 
investigation of influence-peddling known as "Koreagate." 
</P>
<P>
At that time, Derwinski was ranking Republican on a House subcommittee that was 
making the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Federal sources familiar with the incident said the defector and his family 
could have been harmed if the FBI had not escorted them to safety only 30 
minutes before Korean CIA agents arrived at his home in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) of the Senate Veterans' committee was more 
critical, saying that Derwinski's actions -- and later silence and conflicting 
accounts of what he did -- raised "significant ethical questions." 
</P>
<P>
But Cranston -- and the Senate -- decided to overlook what he called "mistakes" 
and "dissembling" by Derwinski and approve his nomination because they said his 
record otherwise was without blemish. 
</P>
<P>
Interrupting the sharply polarized debate over the nomination of John Tower to 
be secretary of defense, the Senate approved Derwinski within hours after its 
Veterans' committee endorsed him by a vote of 10 to 0. 
</P>
<P>
During committee consideration, Cranston said Derwinski's dissembling over the 
episode continued into this year. "I find that these actions raise significant 
ethical questions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Cranston said he decided to vote for Derwinski, adding: "I do not find 
his indiscretions as to this one incident to be disqualifying. I am optimistic 
about Mr. Derwinski's potential to rise above this unattractive episode, to put 
it behind him once and for all." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Frank H. Murkowski (R-Alaska), ranking GOP member of the committee, told 
Derwinski at Wednesday's hearing that he showed a "seeming lack of directness" 
in replying to FBI inquiries about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
In his first public testimony about the event, Derwinski said he did not think 
his remarks about the defector to a South Korean diplomat in 1977 "endangered 
anyone . . . or obstructed justice in any way." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Impromptu Meeting 
</P>
<P>
He said he gave the information about the pending defection to a South Korean 
Embassy political officer during an impromptu meeting outside a House office 
building. Derwinski said he made the comment in the "supercharged atmosphere 
involving anything Korean" and in hindsight should never have said it. 
</P>
<P>
Derwinski's tip became known to federal authorities through U.S. surveillance 
of the South Korean embassy that picked up a reference to his conversation with 
the Korean diplomat, according to a source familiar with the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Derwinski refused to answer questions before a federal grand jury, 
citing his congressional standing as grounds for his silence. At the hearings, 
he said he refused to testify on the advice of his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Although for years he denied tipping off the South Koreans about the defector, 
Derwinski acknowledged his role during 1983 confirmation hearings for a senior 
State Department post but they attracted little attention at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh declined to back a committee request for information 
from that federal grand jury, which ended its inquiry without taking action. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the surreptitious electronic monitoring and other classified 
matters, the Senate panel questioned Derwinski in closed session for 90 minutes 
Tuesday in a special bug-proof room in the Capitol.

MINORITY GAINS FOUND SLIGHT ON HARVARD FACULTY

Almost a decade after Harvard faculty members applauded a report criticizing 
the school for hiring too few women and minorities, a new study issued Thursday 
indicated that little progress has been made. 
</P>
<P>
The report by a 10-member panel reviewed affirmative action in the university's 
Faculty of Arts and Sciences. The faculty of about 900 teachers is the liberal 
arts heart of the school founded in 1636 to educate young men. 
</P>
<P>
"If Harvard as the premier institution that trains the best and the brightest 
is a place that is absent of the best black men and women, it sends a message 
that we are not very good. And many of us are," said Dean Lawrence Watson, 
co-chairman of the Assn. of Black Faculty and Administrators at Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
Watson, who works at the Graduate School of Design, noted that his organization 
represents only 190 people, the total number of black teachers and 
administrators. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard President Derek Bok declined to comment on the report. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that there would be symbolic importance to minority and women 
students at Harvard and in the nation as a whole if there were a more visible 
presence at Harvard of faculty who share their social characteristics," the 
authors of the 18-page report wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Although noting that women face difficulty finding openings at Harvard and 
moving up the faculty ladder, they said blacks, Latinos and American Indians 
need the most help and attention.

EARTH DATA SATELLITES MAY SHUT DOWN FOR LACK OF FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Landsat, the private U.S. satellite system that provides photographs of Earth 
for government and private industry, may shut down this month because the 
government has cut off funding. 
</P>
<P>
The system, owned by a joint venture of Hughes Aircraft and General Electric, 
operates two satellites in low Earth orbit and markets the photographs to a 
variety of customers, such as major oil exploration firms and environmental 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"This is beyond belief," Peter M. P. Norris, executive vice president of Earth 
Observation Satellite Co. (EOSAT), the joint venture, said in a statement. "The 
Landsat program provides important environmental data that touches on projects 
throughout the world, and Landsat data continuity is critical." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
System Is 'Privatized' 
</P>
<P>
The system was formerly owned and operated by the federal government, but the 
Reagan Administration decided in the early 1980s to "privatize" the system by 
turning over the existing satellites to EOSAT. 
</P>
<P>
That effort is now widely regarded as a failure, since it gave competing 
nations an opportunity to overtake U.S. leadership in the technology. Reagan 
Administration officials also wanted to sell the nation's weather satellites, 
but Congress blocked that effort. 
</P>
<P>
Under the privatization plan, EOSAT was supposed to receive annual subsidies to 
operate the system for 10 years, but Norris asserted the government has not 
lived up to that commitment. 
</P>
<P>
"They reneged on their contract," he said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Funds Expire March 31 
</P>
<P>
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has advised EOSAT that 
funding for Landsat operations will expire March 31 and that "no funding will 
be requested for the operation of the satellites." 
</P>
<P>
EOSAT reportedly needs about $10 million to keep Landsat operating for the rest 
of the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, Norris said. 
</P>
<P>
Under a proposed schedule for the shutdown of the system, the two satellites 
would be put on internal control and communication with Earth would be 
terminated on March 27. Government officials cautioned that re-establishing 
contact may be impossible afterwards. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to shutting down the existing satellites, more than 2 million 
archive images of Earth will no longer be available to users because the 
company will cease marketing operations, it said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plans to Testify 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, however, the House Science, Space and Technology Committee has 
called a hearing for Tuesday to look into ways of saving the satellite system. 
Norris said he plans to testify at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
EOSAT operates two satellites, Landsats 4 and 5, which provide photos for such 
purposes as mineral exploration, checking soil conditions and vegetation, urban 
and rural planning, monitoring volcanoes and tracing ocean currents. Norris 
said $1 billion has been invested in the two satellites scheduled to be shut 
down. 
</P>
<P>
EOSAT has struggled financially in recent years, however, facing strong 
competition from the French SPOT-Image satellite system and also the 
possibility of civilian sales of Earth-sensing satellite images by the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. Landsat system is considered superior in technology to either the 
Soviet or French system. Landsat's satellite sensors, built by Hughes Aircraft, 
are capable of capturing images in seven infrared light bands, compared to the 
French system that essentially operates only in the visible light spectrum, a 
Hughes spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the federal government has run out of money to operate the system. 
</P>
<P>
"We simply do not have the funds at this point to continue their operation 
beyond the end of this month," Thomas N. Pyke Jr., head of NOAA's satellite 
office, told the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
"We have gone to the other federal agencies who make use of Landsat data and 
asked them if they can help with the continued funding of Landsat operations, 
but as of today we have received no additional funds from any source," Pyke 
said. 
</P>
<P>
An improved satellite, Landsat 6, is under construction, a Hughes official told 
The Times. That project will continue because funds were provided to complete 
and launch that satellite. 
</P>
<P>
Under the original plan, the government would subsidize EOSAT until Landsat 6 
is launched, which is scheduled for July, 1991. By cutting off funding now, the 
government wants EOSAT to discontinue service for two years until Landsat 6 
begins operation, Norris said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is crazy," he said.

The city's affirmative action-minority enterprise program was overturned 
Thursday by the state Supreme Court, which said officials failed to produce 
enough evidence of past discrimination to justify it. 
</P>
<P>
The court also unanimously found that the Minority-Female Business Enterprise 
program, begun in 1975, was too broadly drawn and failed to consider 
alternatives to a yearly minority participation goal in city contracting. 
</P>
<P>
The program sets a goal that 35% of city contract dollars go to minorities. 
City officials declined comment on the ruling and its implications for the 
program, one of the nation's most recognized and most emulated. 
</P>
<P>
"It is apparent the city had available to it less intrusive means of 
accomplishing the MFBE's race-conscious purposes but had not fully explored 
those," Justice Willis B. Hunt Jr. wrote for the seven-member court. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear whether the ruling on behalf of the American 
Subcontractors Assn. effectively dismantles the program. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Marva Brooks said an appeal is unlikely, but she said unspecified 
steps would be taken to save the minority program.

DEATH SENTENCE REVERSED IN '81 SLAYING OF SUNDAY SCHOOL TEACHER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A closely divided state Supreme Court reversed on Thursday the death sentence 
of the convicted killer of a widowed 76-year-old Pasadena Sunday school teacher 
in an attempted rape and robbery in 1981 that netted the assailant $5. 
</P>
<P>
By a 4-3 vote, the justices held that Bronte Lamont Wright, 34, was entitled to 
a new penalty trial because jurors had improperly heard testimony that Wright 
had threatened to kill several people and had said he liked to do "freaky 
things" to women. 
</P>
<P>
In another capital case, the court unanimously upheld the death sentence of 
Calvin Coleman Jr., 32, for the shotgun slaying of a Sonoma County woman during 
a robbery and burglary in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
In the Wright case, the justices were sharply split over whether the 
impermissible testimony was significant enough to warrant overturning the death 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Important Consideration' 
</P>
<P>
The majority, in an opinion by Justice John A. Arguelles, concluded that there 
was a "reasonable possibility" that the evidence caused jurors to vote for a 
sentence of death, rather than for life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
"To a penalty phase jury . . . the potential danger (Wright) poses to others in 
the prison setting -- guards, counselors, other inmates -- must have been an 
important consideration," Arguelles wrote in an opinion joined by Justices 
Stanley Mosk and Allen E. Broussard and Appellate Justice Keith F. Sparks, who 
was assigned temporarily to the case. 
</P>
<P>
Dissenters, in an opinion by Justice David N. Eagleson, said the erroneously 
admitted testimony of threats was of little importance in view of properly 
received evidence of the brutal slaying and Wright's history of six armed 
robberies and two violent assaults. 
</P>
<P>
"I credit jurors with being able to distinguish between threats and proven acts 
and to weigh their respective evidentiary value accordingly," Eagleson said in 
an opinion joined by Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas and Justice Edward A. 
Panelli. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1981 Murder 
</P>
<P>
Wright was found guilty of the May, 1981, murder of Patricia Hunter, whose body 
was found in her blood-spattered living room by friends who were concerned 
about her absence from a meeting of Sunday school teachers at Pasadena's 
Lincoln Avenue Baptist Church. An examination determined that she had died of 
multiple blows to the head. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence found at the scene led police to Wright, who admitted fatally beating 
the woman. After the beating, he took $5 and some change from her purse, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Wright was sentenced to death, and the verdict was appealed automatically to 
the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
The decisive issue in the appeal was the improper admission of testimony from 
nine witnesses -- most of them prison employees -- who said that when Wright 
was previously in custody, they had heard him make numerous violent threats, 
including a threat to kill several people when released from prison. 
</P>
<P>
The court, as in past rulings, agreed that such threats should not have been 
disclosed to the jury. By statute, only specific factors -- including the 
circumstances of the crime and a defendant's previous felony convictions -- may 
be considered by jurors deciding whether to impose the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Convicted of Murder 
</P>
<P>
Coleman was convicted of the murder of Patricia Neidig and the stabbings of two 
other women in a robbery at the slain victim's rural home in Windsor. Coleman, 
who had just been released from prison after serving time for armed robbery, 
was also found guilty in the rape of one of the survivors in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
The court has upheld 50 death sentences while overturning 21 since the 
departure of Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird and two other court members, who 
were defeated in the 1986 fall election.

INDIAN COURT TO HEAR CHALLENGES TO BHOPAL PACT

The Bhopal compensation case became entangled in legalities Thursday when 
India's Supreme Court agreed to hear a petition challenging the government's 
authority to reach a settlement with Union Carbide. 
</P>
<P>
The court also agreed to hear four other petitions that called for either an 
increase in compensation or asked for court guidance on how relief should be 
distributed among victims of the world's deadliest industrial disaster. 
</P>
<P>
The decision came two weeks after the Supreme Court announced a settlement with 
Union Carbide. 
</P>
<P>
In February, the American company agreed to pay damages of $470 million to 
victims of the Dec. 3, 1984, leak of methyl isocyanate from the pesticide plant 
operated by Union Carbide's Indian subsidiary in Bhopal. 
</P>
<P>
Union Carbide has already deposited the money with the court. 
</P>
<P>
The key petition filed Thursday challenged the Indian government's authority to 
represent the 3,300 people who died in the tragedy or the estimated 20,000 
others injured by the deadly gas. 
</P>
<P>
Under a 1985 act, the Indian government was given sole authority to represent 
all victims of the tragedy after hundreds of Indian and U.S. lawyers said they 
would represent victims in separate cases. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a very strong case," said Charanlal Sahu, a Bhopal attorney who said he 
and his family were affected by exposure to the gas. "The act goes against the 
Indian Constitution. The victims have no confidence in the ability of the Union 
of India." 
</P>
<P>
"You can't snatch away an individual's fundamental right to be heard in a court 
of law," he said. "But the Indian government, by a stroke of a pen, became the 
sole representative of all the victims." 
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice R. S. Pathak said he would hear Sahu's case. 
</P>
<P>
"There is urgency in the matter. . . . It is a case involving the country's 
constitution," Pathak said. 
</P>
<P>
A court official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said four other petitions 
from two gas victims' associations and two human rights lawyers may come up for 
hearings today. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to delay the matter any more," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
But Sahu said that if the court agrees to give the petitions a full hearing, it 
will take at least six months to reach any decisions.

Top jazz musicians are rallying to the aid of Woody Shaw, 44, the blind and 
ailing jazz trumpeter whose left arm was amputated earlier this week after he 
tumbled from a subway platform in Brooklyn, N.Y., into a train's path. 
Musicians around the country have begun organizing a concert to benefit Shaw, 
whose deteriorating health forced him to return last fall to his parents' home 
in Newark, N.J., from the European jazz circuit. "The fact that he is still 
alive -- we're very thankful for that," said alto saxophonist Bobby Watson, who 
shared the bandstand with Shaw during their years as sidemen with Art Blakey's 
Jazz Messengers. ALEENE MacMINN

Choreographer Michael Shawn has filed a $2.75 million lawsuit against the 
producers of "Legs Diamond," saying he was fired from the Peter Allen musical 
after he tested positive for the AIDS virus. The suit, filed in State Court in 
Manhattan, named Marvin Krauss, James M. Nederlander and several other 
producers of the flop musical which closed Feb. 19 at a loss of more than $5 
million. Shawn, who had done the workshop production of the show in 1987, was 
hired to create new dances for "Legs Diamond" last April and had completed most 
of the choreography before entering the hospital Aug. 10 for tests. He was 
fired a week later after the producers confirmed he had tested HIV positive. He 
was replaced by choreographer Alan Johnson when the show went into rehearsal

Meanwhile, the Woody Herman Foundation has announced plans to provide financial 
assistance to ailing and needy professional musicians, especially those with a 
jazz background. The foundation has received donations from several jazz 
organizations and will augment the coffers with fund-raising activities and a 
benefit performance later this year. Herman, a big band leader for more than 50 
years, died Oct. 29, 1987, at age 74. ALEENE MacMINN

MEYER'S 'KINGFISH' TO HAVE NEW YORK PRODUCTION

<P>
Marlane Meyer's "Kingfish," which received its much-applauded world premiere as 
part of the 1987-88 season of the Los Angeles Theatre Center, will receive a 
production at New York's Public Theatre in December. The news was confirmed 
Thursday by the Public's Barbara Carroll who said rehearsals will begin in 
November under the direction of David Schweizer, who staged the play at LATC. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer recently moved to New York but retains her Southern California 
connection. Her latest play, "The Geography of Luck," was given a staged 
reading at LATC last weekend as part of the center's annual Festival of 
Premieres, with Schweizer directing. 
</P>
<P>
In May, "Luck" will be staged at South Coast Repertory by Roberta Levitow. It 
was the winning play of that theater's California Play Festival or CalFest. 
"Luck" then returns to LATC where it will be mounted as a regular season 
production, with Schweizer directing for an Aug. 26 opening. SYLVIE DRAKE

RICHARD RESTORING CAJUN'S BLACKENED NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Accordionist Zachary Richard once was known as the "bad boy of Cajun music." 
Now he's trying to be its good example. 
</P>
<P>
A long-time crusader for the preservation of the French culture and language 
from which Louisiana's Cajun communities sprang, the 38-year-old Richard 
(pronounced Ree-SHARD) earned a reputation for stridence in his campaign, both 
on stage and off. It had a particular intensity in the mid-'70s when Richard 
returned to his Lafayette, La., home after living for several years in Quebec 
and Nova Scotia, where the French vs. English controversy has been especially 
divisive. 
</P>
<P>
"I would go to bars and hang out and insult people I knew were Francophones, 
but who were too lazy to speak to me in French," said Richard, who will bring 
his band to the Music Machine tonight and the Belly-Up in Solana Beach on 
Saturday. "You've got a culture that has been considered worthless. My father 
was beaten in school for speaking French. I was brought up in a very 
traditional family environment. I was obliged to speak French as a child and I 
thank my parents and grandparents for that every day. But there is also still a 
great sense of shame associated with speaking French." 
</P>
<P>
Today, though, Richard has mellowed somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
"I am still militant," he said during a recent phone interview from San 
Francisco. "But you learn and understand things as you go along and your 
militancy alters. I speak French at home and with my friends and read and write 
in French, but I'm not going to go to a shopping mall and try to intimidate 
people into speaking French. The thing I can do is make it attractive to kids, 
show you can be hip and cool and speak French anyway." 
</P>
<P>
That's where the music comes in. Never a Cajun music traditionalist, Richard -- 
who began his career playing folk-rock and progressive country before taking up 
the accordion in the mid-'70s -- mixes churning originals with rocked-up 
versions of Cajun standards like "Jolie Blonde" with a fire comparable to that 
fellow Cajun accordionist Jo-El Sonnier. And both on stage and on albums like 
his latest, "Zack's Bon Ton," he sings at least as much in English as in 
French. 
</P>
<P>
"I never considered Cajun music a museum piece," he said. "Within the last 
couple of years we've been able to create the right songs that fit into both 
the Cajun and rock 'n' roll camps -- rock 'n' roll so heavily influenced by 
Cajun that it really is Cajun, although the purists would probably fall out of 
their chairs." 
</P>
<P>
Richard is somewhat cautious, though, about all the attention Cajun culture has 
received recently through movies such as "The Big Easy" (Richard contributed a 
song to the score), music and cuisine -- specifically about the way elements of 
the culture have been co-opted for commercial value. 
</P>
<P>
"If you talk about Cajun spice potato chips, how much relevance can that have 
to peoples' lives?" he said. "None in Louisiana." 
</P>
<P>
Richard himself has been affected by that. One writer, impressed with his 
energetic performances, dubbed him the "Mick Jagger of Cajun music." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really the Tina Turner of Cajun music," Richard joked. "Whoever came up 
with that, I'm not sure if he thought he was doing me a favor or just lacked 
imagination. I'm flattered, but it's an unfortunate thing to be compared to. 
I've been called the Cajun this and the Cajun that and I just scratch my head. 
I don't think it puts the Cajun culture in perspective, because we don't need 
to be compared to anyone." 
</P>
<P>
But on the other hand, he believes that Cajun culture's recognition throughout 
the country is a positive step. 
</P>
<P>
"It has caught on as a fad, which will pass," he said. "But it has made Cajun 
people proud of what they are. Until someone from the outside said that Cajun 
is hot, for the first time in their lives these people realized the importance 
of the culture for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
And he's happy that Cajun music's increased visibility has given him more of a 
platform to further his cause. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to maintain oneself as a standard bearer, as an example, as one 
who still exists even if we are the vestiges of a culture that has become 
assimilated."

Against the limitless black of the night sky British artist John Murphy sets 
out on a lyric search for the essence of life. It's a romantic venture, rich in 
metaphor and philosophic contradiction where titles like "At Evening an Odour 
of Violets and Clay (Sagitta)" reach for the sensation that forms the thrill 
and chill of mortality itself. 
</P>
<P>
If the ideas are complex, the paintings in the "Constellations" series can so 
simple they seem too easy. Murphy covers huge canvasses with thick, blue-black 
impasto and sparsely flecked dots that appear like tiny warm stars shining in 
cold infinity. In one small portion of this whipped blackness, dots are joined 
with white lines to form a fragment of a star map. The constellation's name is 
written in. 
</P>
<P>
The uncomplicated nature of the imagery forms something of a demanding, visual 
keyhole onto Murphy's distilled ideas. The longer you look at the rectangular 
patch of deep space, the more meaning seeps through. Once comforting, the night 
sky becomes overwhelming. The ancient assignment of astrological names and 
zodiac shapes to the vastness of the universe is reduced to an arbitrary and 
somehow futile gesture of relative order. It's a faintly nostalgic realization 
brought on by an art that licks at the bittersweet essence of self-awareness 
and then tries to describe the flavor. (Asher/Faure, 612 N. Almont Drive, to 
March 18.)SUVAN GEER

Some years back Daniel Douke switched from painting trompe l'oeil cardboard 
cartons to non-figurative canvases. These have the same alchemical yearning to 
turn one thing into another. In this show, Douke transforms acrylic, plastic 
and bondo into chameleon textures resembling everything from troweled on, 
whip-cream-thick finger paint, to lacquered, technicolor metal. 
</P>
<P>
His earlier penchant for making paint look like actual objects may have 
reflected a frustrated sculptural bent. He gives this impulse full rein in 
works like "Incident" with its three uppermost horizontal bands of raw, frothy 
color and "aged metal" stakes protruding out a foot or more from a densely 
layered square field. 
</P>
<P>
Abstract compositions caged behind faux-metal grates are so convincing they 
invite a touch test. Douke has so thoroughly mastered the nuts and bolts of 
painting that he can keep thrashing around at its frontiers. However, the works 
that stay with us keep the three-dimensional pyrotechnics in check, opting for 
pure, clear abstract emblems close in feel to Jasper Johns. In spite of 
considerable technical facility, too many works leave us wondering what the 
point is. (Tortue Gallery, 2917 Santa Monica Blvd., to March 11.) MARLENA

'BOY DETECTIVE': A CASE OF A MISSING STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The popular children's book series by Donald J. Sobol, "Encyclopedia Brown: Boy 
Detective," makes it to the small screen in "The Case of the Missing Time 
Capsule," a one-hour special airing on HBO at 8 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
It starts out with a few unexpected chuckles -- a sort of kids' version of the 
slapstick satire "Police Squad"; unfortunately, its obnoxiousness and dumbness 
increase in direct ratio to the time it's on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
The limited acting expertise of some of the cast becomes more obvious as well. 
</P>
<P>
Encyclopedia Brown (Scott Bremner) is a small 10-year-old genius with his own 
detective agency ("No Case Too Small; $1 a Day, Plus Expenses") who habitually 
solves mysteries that his helpless, vacuous elders cannot. 
</P>
<P>
When someone steals a buried time capsule that was due to be opened at the 
Idaville centennial celebration, Brown has several suspects, including a rock 
guitarist, a bad kid named Bugs Meany and the local auto mechanic, Buddy (Rick 
Overton). 
</P>
<P>
With vast superiority -- much easier to take in Sobol's books than in D.J. 
McHale's uneven teleplay -- Brown saves the day. 
</P>
<P>
Questions: Why have Brown's mom look into the camera and utter a rude street 
expression? Why have the rock star make a reference to certain tests at a 
health clinic? And do we really need to see all the threatening gun play? 
</P>
<P>
Sobol's books are for kids, but McHale and director "Savage" Steve Holland seem 
to be confused about their target audience. LYNNE HEFFLEY

'RESCUE RANGERS' NOT UP TO DISNEY STANDARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Chip 'n' Dale: Rescue Rangers," which debuts on the Disney Channel Saturday at 
9:30 a.m., is the least impressive animated series Disney has offered since it 
entered the television cartoon market in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Like the successful "Ducktails," "Rescue Rangers" elevates minor characters 
from old theatrical cartoons to central roles. But the "Ducktails" writers had 
Carl Barks' imaginative comic book stories to draw on for material; although 
Chip and Dale appeared in 23 shorts, they were rarely more than foils for 
Donald Duck's temper. The mischievous chipmunks never exhibited much 
personality. 
</P>
<P>
The creators of the new series have added little to the characters aside from a 
few changes in wardrobe. Chip now wears an Indiana Jones hat and leather 
jacket, while Dale is tricked out in a "Magnum, P.I." Hawaiian shirt. They're 
joined by Monterey Jack, a burly mouse with a "G'day mate" Australian accent; 
Zipper, a nondescript bug, and the spunky Gadget, who looks a bit like Pearl 
Pureheart on "Mighty Mouse." 
</P>
<P>
The premiere episode, "Pirates Under the Sea," fails to explain who the Rescue 
Rangers are and what they're supposed to do. Are they adventurers? Detectives? 
Thieves? No one seems to know, including writer Mark Edens and directors John 
Kimball and Bob Zamboni. 
</P>
<P>
"Rescue Rangers" boasts the rich production values that have marked other 
Disney programs, but the adventures aren't exciting and the attempts at humor 
aren't funny. Given the weakness of this material and its poor execution, it 
seems unlikely that this show will duplicate the success of "Ducktails" when it 
moves to syndication this fall, even with the Disney name attached to it.

INDEPENDENT LAB REPORTS 60 HORSES MAY BE POSITIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A report by an independent New Mexico laboratory indicates that as many as 60 
horses that ran at Santa Anita last year had suspicious postrace urine samples. 
</P>
<P>
International Diagnostics Systems of Las Cruces, N.M., which analyzed almost 
500 urine samples from the 27-day Oak Tree meeting at Santa Anita last fall, 
found that the horses had possibly run with a variety of illegal drugs, 
including cocaine. The laboratory identified 16 chemical products that are 
banned by state racing officials. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas a suspicious test might not necessarily stand up in court, it could 
lead to a positive result with further analysis. Some of the samples have been 
sent to Cornell University, which tests New York race horses, to see if they 
can be proven positive. 
</P>
<P>
The New Mexico report is the result of a contract the laboratory has with the 
California division of the Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Assn. and some 
other horse groups. The laboratory has been testing California samples for the 
last six months. 
</P>
<P>
The report is scheduled to be presented at a general meeting of the HBPA later 
this month. The group contracted International Diagnostics to test split urine 
samples because of rumors that illegal medications were being used by trainers, 
and because of fears that Truesdail Laboratories in Tustin did not have the 
sophisticated testing equipment necessary to detect the substances. 
</P>
<P>
Truesdail, the state's main testing laboratory, has found cocaine in the 
systems of six horses, dating to last summer at Del Mar. There was a 12% 
incidence of suspicious tests from the Oak Tree meeting, International 
Diagnostics found. The laboratory also analyzed hundreds of urine samples from 
horses that ran at Del Mar last summer and found a similar percentage to be 
suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
Some members of the HBPA, which represents most of California's trainers and 
owners, have described the use of a backup laboratory as a "witch hunt." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Ken Maddy (R-Fresno) has introduced a bill in the state legislature that 
would allow the School of Veterinary Medicine at UC Davis to test at least 25% 
of the horses that run in California. 
</P>
<P>
Len Foote, the executive secretary of the California Horse Racing Board, has 
been critical of International Diagnostics, which was an unsuccessful bidder 
for the state's horse testing last year. 
</P>
<P>
Foote also said a couple of weeks ago that he thought Truesdail would find more 
cocaine positives. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman in Foote's office said Thursday that Foote had "no direct 
information" about the International Diagnostics report. She also said that 
Foote did not know if Truesdail has been able to re-test the Oak Tree samples 
analyzed by International Diagnostics.

In the 11 months after he broke the 100-meter world record at the World 
Championships at Rome in August, 1987, Ben Johnson used anabolic steroids 
during three different periods, his coach, Charlie Francis, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But since it does not seem likely that Johnson would have tested positive at 
the Summer Olympics in September, 1988, as a result of those injections, 
because they had occurred so long before, the question of whether the Canadian 
sprinter used anabolic steroids in the two months before his competition at 
Seoul was left unanswered when Francis ended his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Whether he will make that allegation, or stand by his original claim at Seoul 
that Johnson was sabotaged, probably will be answered Monday, when Francis 
returns for his fourth day of testimony before the Canadian government's 
Inquiry into the Use of Drugs and Banned Practices Intended to Increase 
Athletic Performance. 
</P>
<P>
Francis might have provided a hint when he said that Johnson had his own bottle 
of Winstrol tablets, prescribed for him a few years previously by his 
physician, Jamie Astaphan. Winstrol contains stanozolol, the banned steroid 
discovered in Johnson's urine after he had won the 100-meter race at Seoul. 
Johnson was disqualified after the positive drug test, losing his gold medal 
and the world record he set in that race. 
</P>
<P>
Francis' testimony Thursday was nowhere near as dramatic as it had been the day 
before, when he revealed that Johnson, 27, began using performance-enhancing 
drugs, including steroids, in 1981, named 10 other athletes coached by him who 
used drugs between 1979 and 1986 and implicated several other prominent 
athletes from eight countries, most of them from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But Francis did name two additional Canadian athletes, also coached by him, who 
began taking drugs in the fall of 1987 as they began preparation for the Summer 
Olympics, prominent high hurdler Mark McKoy and long jumper Tracy Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Francis, an Olympic sprinter for Canada in 1972 and a full-time coach since 
1978, also revealed in detail, complete with graphs, the elaborate training 
plan that he and Astaphan, who is from the Caribbean island of St. Kitts, 
devised to propel Johnson toward his existing world-record time of 9.83 seconds 
at the 1987 World Championships. That beat the previous record by a full 10th 
of a second. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is now apparent that the plan included the use of steroids, which 
have been banned in track and field since 1974, Johnson passed his drug test in 
Rome. John Holt, secretary general of the International Amateur Athletic 
Federation, which governs the sport, said there is no legal way to strip 
Johnson of the world record. 
</P>
<P>
Francis said that the first phase of their program for 1987 began in the fall 
of 1986, when Francis injected Johnson with a steroid, Furazabol. Johnson was 
supposed to visit Francis' Toronto apartment three times a week for three weeks 
to receive the injections, but Johnson apparently was not the most dedicated 
patient. 
</P>
<P>
"He seemed fairly random," Francis said. "So he never had the full amount he 
was supposed to have (during that period)." 
</P>
<P>
But Francis said that he and Astaphan were better able to monitor Johnson's 
drug use at a training camp later that fall at St. Kitts, where the doctor gave 
the sprinter two shots a week of Furazabol for two weeks. Francis said that 
Johnson also took one tablet -- four milligrams -- a day of Winstrol for at 
least a week during that fall. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's drug use, Francis said, resumed for a six-week period in the spring 
of 1987, when, back in Toronto, he resumed going to his coach's apartment for 
injections. Francis said he gave Johnson three shots a week for three weeks and 
two shots a week for the next three weeks, adding that the sprinter also took 
Winstrol during one of those weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"He was pretty regular at that time," Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-summer, two months before the World Championships, Francis said that 
Johnson began another drug cycle, receiving two injections a week of Furazabol 
for two weeks at the coach's apartment. Francis said that he did not believe 
that Johnson was taking Winstrol at that time. 
</P>
<P>
It was during three separate training periods during the year that Francis' 
athletes used drugs, he said, adding that it usually amounted to 14 weeks a 
year, six weeks between October and December, six weeks between March and May 
and two weeks in July. 
</P>
<P>
It was obvious that their program was working as early as January, 1987, when 
Johnson broke the world record in the 60 meters in an indoor race at Osaka, 
Japan. He tied that record twice during the winter before again breaking it, 
running a 6.41 in March at the indoor world championships at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also had an outstanding summer, running faster than 10 seconds in the 
100 meters three times before arriving in Rome to beat his archrival, Carl 
lewis, in a world-record time of 9.83. Francis was not surprised. Only days 
before, he had predicted that Johnson would run 9.85. 
</P>
<P>
Neither was Francis surprised that Johnson did not test positive for steroids 
at Rome. Although he said that he and Astaphan believed that an athlete could 
stop using Furazabol 14 days before a competition and test clean, they advised 
their athletes to quit at least 28 days in advance. That gave them a two-week 
cushion. 
</P>
<P>
Francis said that he had been optimistic about 1988. Considering Johnson's 9.83 
in 1987, and the program that was planned for 1988, Francis predicted a 9.80 
for Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Johnson ran a 9.79 at the Olympics. Francis said that it would have 
been a 9.73 if Johnson had not begun celebrating before he reached the finish 
line. 
</P>
<P>
But the road to Seoul was filled with potential disasters. 
</P>
<P>
First, there was Johnson's increased popularity, a double-edged sword. It made 
him wealthy, but it also interrupted his routine. During the fall, 1987, 
training period, Francis said that Johnson was able to work out for only three 
weeks because of his travel schedule. That meant, Francis said, that Johnson 
took Furazabol for three weeks, three times a week, instead of six. 
</P>
<P>
It did not seem to affect his performances initially in 1988. He set world 
records in two of his first three indoor races. But then he pulled a hamstring 
in his left leg during a race in mid-February at West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson decided to take a two-week vacation to St. Kitts. 
</P>
<P>
In March, Johnson returned to Toronto in better shape than Francis expected to 
begin another six-week training period. Again, Francis said, Johnson was not 
able to take the Furazabol for the entire six weeks because of his travel 
commitments. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by the inquiry's co-counsel, Robert P. Armstrong, whether Johnson took 
Winstrol during that period, Francis said, "I don't believe so." 
</P>
<P>
When the outdoor season began in the spring, Francis said that he did not 
believe Johnson was completely recovered from the hamstring injury. Still, he 
entered Johnson in a race at Tokyo on May 13, although Francis said that it was 
arranged through the promoter for there to be no valid competition. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted the field to be as soft as we could reasonably get away with," 
Francis said, describing a practice that is often suspected but seldom 
confirmed in track and field. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea was to ease Ben back into competition. We felt that he would still 
win the race and stay undefeated (as he had been since 1986)." 
</P>
<P>
But May 13 fell on a Friday. Johnson did not finish the race, stopping short 
with a pull in the same hamstring that he had injured during the indoor season 
three months before. 
</P>
<P>
Francis and his athletes, including Johnson, returned to Toronto and were 
supposed to leave two days later for a training camp and several meets in 
Europe. Although Johnson would not be able to compete for several weeks, 
Francis wanted the sprinter in Europe to work with a physical therapist, 
Waldemar Matuszewski. Johnson wanted to go to St. Kitts. 
</P>
<P>
They argued, Francis said, before Johnson relented. But when the plane left for 
Europe, Johnson was not on it. Francis said that Johnson went to St. Kitts to 
recuperate under Astaphan's care. It was in St. Kitts that Johnson began his 
third steroid cycle in the year leading to the Olympics, Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
Since Francis was not present, he was asked by Armstrong how he had become 
aware of that. 
</P>
<P>
"From talking to Ben," Francis said. "He said he had the same sequence of shots 
he would have had (in the summer). He had it sooner than he would have mostly 
because of the injury." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the injections were of Furazabol, Francis said, "That's what I expect 
he was doing." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if steroids would have helped Johnson recover from his injury, Francis 
said, "Yes. One of the reasons they were invented was to speed up the healing 
process." 
</P>
<P>
Although Johnson was expected in Europe on several occasions, he and Astaphan 
did not arrive until almost a month after the injury. They caught up with 
Francis and the other Canadians in Padua, Italy, in mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
The tension evident, Francis said that he and Johnson barely spoke to each for 
two days. When they finally sat down together, they decided to part, 
interrupting an 11-year relationship. Francis said that he did not believe that 
Astaphan came between them, although it was apparent that Johnson relied 
heavily on the doctor's advice. 
</P>
<P>
Francis was upset because Johnson had not joined the team in Europe when he 
promised. Johnson was upset because Francis had not called to check on his 
progress in St. Kitts. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he didn't want to work with me again," Francis said. "I told him to 
come back a year from then and tell me if he made the right decision." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson returned to St. Kitts with Astaphan, who soon would be on the 
sprinter's payroll at $10,000 a month. Francis remained in Europe, taking his 
athletes to several track meets. 
</P>
<P>
At a meet in Lille, France, Francis decided that he and Johnson needed each 
other. His inspiration, he said, was Carl Lewis. Or rather his distaste for 
Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him racing without competition and then mugging and carrying on in the 
stands in what I saw as his usual fashion," Francis said. "I couldn't conceive 
at that point of walking away and allowing Carl Lewis to win (at Seoul) without 
opposition when Ben was a far superior athlete." 
</P>
<P>
Within days, Francis and Johnson, who both had returned to Toronto in 
mid-summer, were working together again. 
</P>
<P>
"He looked very ragged technically," Francis said. "But his speed was 
excellent. It was clear that with a little work on his technique, he would 
quickly round into shape. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no question in my mind he would win in Seoul."

CHRB FILES FORMAL ACCUSATIONS AGAINST LUKAS AND LAZ BARRERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Horse Racing Board Thursday lodged formal accusations against 
trainers Wayne Lukas and Laz Barrera in its continuing crackdown on drug abuse 
in thoroughbred racing. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas and Barrera each are accused of running horses last summer at Del Mar 
that subsequently tested positive for cocaine. Both have denied the charge. 
</P>
<P>
Under racing's "absolute insurer" rule, the trainer is ultimately liable for 
the condition of his or her horse, however, and Lukas and Barrera are "subject 
to discipline, including revocation or suspension" of their licenses, according 
to CHRB papers filed Thursday at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
The next step in the process is for each trainer to have a hearing before the 
board of stewards, probably within the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The horse in question in the Lukas case is Crown Collection, who won the 
seventh race at Del Mar last Aug. 29 and was unplaced in another race there 
Sept. 14. Initial tests conducted by Truesdail Laboratory in Tustin showed "no 
prohibited drug substance" in the post-race urine and blood samples on either 
occasion. More sensitive retesting last month revealed traces of cocaine in 
each sample. 
</P>
<P>
Barrera's horse, Endow, is involved in the same scenario, winning the sixth 
race at Del Mar on Aug. 31, at first testing negative and then retesting 
positive for cocaine last month. 
</P>
<P>
In another drug-related case at Santa Anita, trainer Richard Mulhall was fined 
$500 by the stewards and his horse, Its Royalty, has been disqualified from its 
Jan. 11 victory. Its Royalty's postrace test showed the presence of procaine.

AS CLIPPERS LOSE AGAIN, TALK TURNS TO COACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Is there a V in the Clippers' future? 
</P>
<P>
A victory should come, sometime, but it didn't Thursday night as Clyde Drexler 
scored 31 points to lead the Portland Trail Blazers to a 119-113 victory before 
10,213 in the Sports Arena. It was the Clippers' 11th consecutive defeat. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was overshadowed by owner Donald T. Sterling's confirmation that the 
Clippers have held discussions with Jim Valvano -- the North Carolina State 
coach -- about taking over the team next season. Don Casey has coached on an 
interim basis since Gene Shue was fired Jan. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling said that "there's been some communication" with Valvano and that 
"there is some interest on both sides." 
</P>
<P>
Sterling also said it is too early to determine Casey's chances of being named 
permanent coach. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the process of compiling a list of possible candidates," he said. "We 
are also watching the present interim-coach situation. Valvano has to be on the 
top of anyone's list." 
</P>
<P>
He would not say how serious the Valvano talks have been. But when asked about 
an unconfirmed report that Valvano and Clipper representatives had two 
discussions earlier in the year and agreed to talk again at the end of North 
Carolina State's season, Sterling said: "That's only half right." He would not 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Valvano was unavailable for comment Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the San Antonio Light reported Thursday that -- according to Spur 
Coach Larry Brown -- Spur owner B.J. (Red) McCombs and Sterling have discussed 
Brown's availability after the season. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling denied the report. McCombs, although expressing disappointment over 
Brown's first coaching season at San Antonio, where the Spurs are 13-43, said, 
". . . I don't see any changes." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Glass, one of Brown's closest friends and his financial adviser, has said 
that Clipper president Alan Rothenberg inquired twice last season about Brown, 
who was coaching the University of Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, after coming close to returning to UCLA, signed a five-year, 
$3.5-million contract to coach at San Antonio. He has said he does not want to 
leave the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
Casey, meanwhile, would like to remain with the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
The loss to the Trail Blazers Thursday night dropped his record to 1-19 in his 
first try as a National Basketball Assn. Seven of the losses have been by seven 
or fewer points. 
</P>
<P>
Most Clippers say they are comfortable with Casey, and some say he should be 
retained. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an optimist," Casey said. "But I'm also a realist." 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Charles Smith, who averaged 18.4 points and 8.2 rebounds in February, despite 
playing the last four games of the month with a dislocated left index finger, 
was named the NBA rookie of the month. He beat out Golden State's Mitch 
Richmond. "It's something positive with all the other stuff going on," said 
Smith, who went into Thursday's game averaging 15.5 points and 6.5 rebounds 
overall. "It makes me feel good that something good is happening around us." . 
. . Reggie Williams missed his second straight game with a hip pointer and will 
not play Saturday at Phoenix.

UCLA'S JOHN SMITH CHALLENGES FRANCIS' TESTIMONY IN TORONTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Smith, the assistant UCLA track and field coach who Wednesday was 
implicated in the Canadian drug hearings, said he is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony by sprint coach Charlie Francis implied that Smith had been a 
supplier of drugs to athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Francis, disgraced sprinter Ben Johnson's coach, said that a former world 
record-holder at 440 yards had given a bottle of Dianabol, an anabolic steroid, 
to a prominent female coach who worked with a prominent female sprinter. 
Francis was apparently referring to Smith, who held the 440 record, former 
coach Pat Connolly and Evelyn Ashford, the former world record-holder at 100 
meters. 
</P>
<P>
"I, John Smith, can refute anything being said, but it's not me alone," Smith 
said Thursday. "It's about two other dear friends of mine. I want to clear 
their names. I'm concerned about them. They have stood against this. As long as 
I've known Pat over the last 20 years, she's been anti-drug." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he knows Francis and has some sympathy for him in his current 
predicament. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to take shots at Charlie, he has his own cross to bear," Smith 
said. "(But) No. 1, I want to clear my name. I want to clear the name of my 
school. I don't take steroids and I don't advocate my athletes to take them. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never made a public statement about it, but it's been known that I would 
give my athletes blood tests. When we (the Santa Monica Track Club) go to 
Europe, the promoters love us. We don't have to make a deal. I train drug-free 
athletes. That's a fact." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that the allegations were worse for him and Ashford, because they 
are still active in the sport. Connolly no longer coaches. "He's messing with 
my profession," Smith said. "Charlie has nothing to lose by singing his song. 
Evelyn and I sit here because we are still in the sport. I'd like to meet with 
him face to face and then we'd deal with it." JULIE CART

VED MEHTA RUMINATES ON RUSHDIE FUROR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARRY ABRAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ved Mehta is a man of the world because he had no choice. 
</P>
<P>
Blind since age 4, rootless since his teens, Mehta, a California-educated 
native of India and author of 18 wide-ranging books, has lived on three 
continents through the whims of history and personal fate. Rootlessness is a 
kind of home, he believes, one that he shares with many other modern writers, 
including his fellow countryman, novelist Salman Rushdie, under a death 
sentence from Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini for his novel "The Satanic Verses." 
</P>
<P>
"In order to feel dislocated, you have to belong somewhere," says Mehta, 
currently a visiting fellow at England's Oxford University. "I feel I really 
don't belong anywhere. I really belong to the 20th-Century population of 
displaced persons, refugees." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Mehta, a naturalized American citizen, has maintained connections with his 
past, occasionally visiting his native country and other wellsprings of his 
long-running autobiography, "Continents of Exile," whose sixth volume has just 
been published. This option, he fears, may never again be open to Rushdie, who 
is in hiding somewhere in Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of this reaction (to "Satanic Verses") was predictable from square one -- 
not the death sentence," Mehta said in an interview while on a visit to 
Southern California. "But I wish someone had told him along the way that you 
just can't write this particular way because certainly he's going to be cut off 
from the very source of his creativity." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Considered Blasphemous 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie's bitter, satirical, allegorical novel -- the spark of riots, bombings 
and more than a score of deaths in India and Pakistan -- is considered 
blasphemous by many Muslims because it casts doubt on central tenets of the 
Muslim religion. Among other things, it suggests that the Prophet Mohammed 
wrote the Koran, Islam's holy book, rather than receiving it through the divine 
inspiration of God. 
</P>
<P>
Mehta, a Hindu who met the Muslim Rushdie when the two were doing a series of 
television appearances, seemed more saddened than angered by the furor. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a great tragedy because I can't imagine his ever being able to 
live and move freely the way I can or the way any writer must because even if 
he repents or the Ayatollah withdraws his sentence, there are enough fanatic 
Muslims that sooner or later somebody will try to kill him," he said. "So I 
think that there's practically no place he can go unless he gets a new identity 
like some of these FBI witnesses do. But what kind of life is that?" 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Mehta's life is a study in freedom of movement -- despite his 
blindness. This week he came back to California, to one of the places he has 
called home in 40 years of exile. 
</P>
<P>
The autobiographer, biographer, novelist and journalist recently returned to 
Pomona College to be honored as a globally respected author and a distinguished 
alumnus -- he's a member of the class of 1956 and has just published the 
memoirs of his college days. 
</P>
<P>
Now 54, Mehta wore a gray suit, blue-striped shirt and a red tie as he stepped 
back on campus for a series of lunches, lectures, interviews and other events 
to officially mark his passage into Pomona stardom. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fierce Independence 
</P>
<P>
Clearly he was no longer the uncertain, shy, desperate young man he portrays in 
"The Stolen Light," published this week by Norton. Just as clearly, Mehta 
retains the determination, aloofness and fierce independence of the young man 
who walked around the campus unassisted, often going so fast he passed his 
sighted classmates like a speeding train. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the six volumes of the extended tour of his life have been published in 
the New Yorker, where he has long been a staff writer. The other volumes are 
"Daddyji," "Mamaji," "Vedi," "The Ledge Between the Streams" and "Sound-Shadows 
of the New World." The books are profiles of his family, himself and chronicles 
of the events that shaped all their lives as refugees from what is now Pakistan 
following the partition of India in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
The best-known aspects of Mehta's life probably are his meningitis-induced 
blindness and his subsequent struggles to deal with his handicap. That struggle 
took him to America, to a school for the blind in Arkansas and, through a chain 
of events reported in the current volume, to Pomona where as a blind, 
dark-skinned foreigner he was more than exotic, perhaps almost 
extraterrestrial. 
</P>
<P>
But in the 33 years since he graduated, Mehta said he has become at ease with 
the once strange culture of California and the rites of passage he experienced 
at Pomona. In fact, he has come so far from his beginnings that he no longer 
feels the pull of nostalgia for his native country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rode Bicycle on Campus 
</P>
<P>
"My experience is totally English and American, so what would I miss anymore?" 
he asked as he strolled across the campus quadrangle where he once rode a 
bicycle to the consternation of his classmates. "I don't particularly like 
Indian food that much; I find it very debilitating. I love it when I am in 
India. But outside I'd rather eat western food; it's lighter and I can work 
longer hours on it. I miss my family. . . . But now I have my own children and 
my own family. So, you know, one moves on." 
</P>
<P>
By moving on, writers such as himself and Rushdie have become a part of the 
20th Century's millions who have become cultural hybrids through their 
dislocation, Mehta said. 
</P>
<P>
"To be an artist is to be alienated from the society in which you live. 
Alienation is built into the artistic temperament, I think," Mehta said. "What 
we are now talking about is an alienation that is kind of an overlay on top of 
being an outsider, which I think has to do with being outside the national 
tradition, of belonging to a community of expatriate writers and artists." 
Rushdie, himself and other prominent expatriate Indian writers "might be said 
to belong to English tradition more strongly than to Indian tradition because, 
after all, we write in English," he added. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that many of us perhaps have a double vision. We have the vision of 
our antecedents and then we have another vision that has to do with our 
education. After all, Rushdie was educated at Rugby and Oxford, I believe. His 
sensibility has been honed by his English experience. It's true the antecedents 
have been important because his parents live in Pakistan and he was born in 
India. But in a way his cultural experience is not that different from 
(Indian-born British novelist Rudyard) Kipling, most of whose adult educated 
life was outside India." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Novel Is Extension of His Story 
</P>
<P>
In "The Stolen Light," Mehta said, the story of a fellow student called "K" who 
committed suicide is "by extension also my story. We were both culturally 
maladjusted. We belonged neither to East nor West. He belonged neither to Japan 
nor America. I belonged neither to India nor America. . . . How did cultural 
maladjustment lead in his case to suicide while I somehow escaped it? . . . I 
was from India, where marriages were arranged like real estate transactions, 
and found myself in the car culture of California where in order to have dates 
you had to have cars." 
</P>
<P>
In Mehta's view, "The Stolen Light" is "ruthlessly honest." Besides "K's" 
suicide, Mehta tells of his own sexual involvement with a woman that leads to 
an abortion, and of his romantic longings for other female students. It also is 
a litany of the additional labors of a blind student -- finding people to read 
books to him, finding others to type his papers, the constant race just to stay 
current in his classes. 
</P>
<P>
In moments of frustration and stress, Mehta -- who refuses to use a cane or a 
seeing-eye dog -- recalled that he sometimes would ride a bicycle around the 
college, one of many fetes that he has taught himself in the struggle for 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
As he arrived at Pomona this week, he swiveled his head around the campus, 
trying to recall those moments. 
</P>
<P>
"I would ride along College Way and then -- is that 3rd Street down south 
there? -- and then I would go right, or left to Kenyon House," he said, 
summoning up a mental map. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Books Stand on Their Own 
</P>
<P>
How he gained his skills, the sacrifices his family made to educate their blind 
son, the often funny daily events of his extended family, are told in the 
volumes of "Continents of Exile." But Mehta stressed that they can all be read 
independently and that each book is meant to stand on its own. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently responding to the assertions of some critics that he has gone on at 
too much length about his life, Mehta stressed, too, that he has written many 
other books in between the volumes of autobiography, which began appearing in 
1972. His other works include a biography of Mahatma Gandhi, a novel, a book on 
television and several books of intellectual reportage, a genre he is credited 
with inventing. 
</P>
<P>
Although he thinks "my books don't get the attention that I think they 
deserve," Mehta believes that ultimately he will be vindicated. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always hard when you're living to get the attention," he said. "There are 
50,000 books published every year and it's very difficult for critics and 
people to sort out. What I do know is that there is a body of readers and 
critics that is slowly building up. When that will come to some kind of 
maturation, I don't know. But it doesn't matter." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Mehta certainty wavers when he's asked why he has chosen to explore 
his life in such great detail. He talks about the subject for a time and then 
concludes: "Anyway, I'm not quite clear why I'm doing it at this length. All I 
can tell you is that I've lived on three continents and I'm exploring myself, 
but by extension I'm exploring the continents of India and America and, now, 
England." 
</P>
<P>
To an observer the answer seems obvious: Ved Mehta has made a home by writing 
books.

MEET THE EQUITY EMIGRES, L.A. HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE CASHING IN AND BAILING OUT; 
ONLY THEY'RE FINDING PARADISE HAS ITS THORNS, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
You hear it all over Los Angeles. It's a perennial topic at dinner parties, 
while waiting for the Versateller, in muted conversations in elevators and 
bars: Housing prices are increasing so fast, they can't possibly be real! 
</P>
<P>
And when the neighborhood disgrace -- the dumpy little corner cottage with the 
sagging roof and crooked fence -- sells for $300,000, all the neighbors are so 
astonished they stand on the sidewalk in hushed groups, look back at their own 
houses with unnaturally bright eyes and make plans to leave Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The good news for Los Angeles property owners is that -- thanks to equity 
appreciation -- they now have the means to fulfill their fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, the median price of housing in Los Angeles County has increased 
40%, according to the California Assn. of Realtors. For some houses in the 
$200,000-to-$400,000 range, prices rose 40% in the last year alone. These are 
"unprecedented windfalls," says Tony Contratto, a Manhattan Beach tax lawyer. 
"People become millionaires by virtue of owning property in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Even when they don't actually become rich, they at least have options that 
ordinary people with ordinary incomes never dreamed of having. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bigger and Better Homes 
</P>
<P>
After as little as three or four years of owning a home in Los Angeles, people 
can sell their houses and use the profits to buy bigger and better houses -- 
often with no mortgages -- in cleaner and quieter parts of the country where 
children can play outside without danger of crime, traffic, smog and itinerant 
malcontents. 
</P>
<P>
"A guy at the end of the street put up a little handwritten sign," says Kathryn 
Rowley, a lawyer who lives in Silver Lake. "We thought he was trying to sell a 
lawn mower. He sold his house in three hours, picked up his new baby and went 
back to New Jersey." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Sawyer, a Santa Monica businessman who decided his hometown was no longer a 
place to raise children, sold his home on a busy street adjacent to a 
commercial lot for $400,000. He moved to Asheville, N.C., where he bought a 
four-bedroom, three-bath, trilevel on a one-acre wooded lot for $145,000. 
</P>
<P>
In 18 years, lawyer George Caton saw his two-bedroom-and-a-den stucco home near 
Century City appreciate 1,200%. Since he had had it, he says, with crime and 
the inability of people here to form "quality friendships," he bought a 
6,000-square-foot home last year in a quiet, tree-lined residential area of 
Spokane, Wash., for $120,000. "And my house," he says, "is one of the smaller 
houses on the street." 
</P>
<P>
Although about half the residents of Los Angeles, according to a recent Times 
poll, say they have considered leaving the city in the last year, relatively 
few will go ahead and do it. Despite the crime, traffic and growing sense that 
the city is slipping downhill, for most people, the money to be made here and 
the career and life-style options are just too enticing. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, says USC urban planner Dowell Myers, most people talk about quality of 
life here the way they talk about the weather: Just because they have strong 
opinions on it doesn't mean they are planning to leave. For most people, it's 
consolation enough to know that when push comes to shove they have options. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if you don't go," UCLA family psychologist Irene Goldenberg says, "the 
sense of freedom is wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
But for those determined to get out, the opportunities can be stunning. Peter 
Parnegg, a former Los Angeles musician, traded in a two-bedroom 
1,500-square-foot house in Studio City for a four-bedroom, 4,000-square-foot 
house on an acre lot with a swimming pool in Albuquerque, N.M. "You can 
increase your standard of living right out of the gate," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Housing prices -- with the exception of cities like Boston, New York and San 
Francisco -- are usually one-half to one-third of what they are in Los Angeles. 
Car insurance is 50% to 75% less. Restaurant prices are dramatically cheaper. 
In Asheville, N.C., says Sawyer, the former Santa Monica businessman, "you can 
buy a ticket to a first-run movie for $1.50." 
</P>
<P>
More important, compared to Los Angeles, the air is cleaner, the pace less 
harried, the traffic unbelievably light. There's an exhilarating sense of 
freedom and space. Supermarkets are less crowded. The sky is darker at night. 
Instead of having to leave an hour early to meet someone for lunch across town, 
you can get there in 10 minutes. No one panhandles you. There are parking 
spaces in front of the library. 
</P>
<P>
Jill Hearing, a Garden Grove resident who moved to Seattle, still can't believe 
how lush and green everything is there. "The air is cleaner," she says. "You 
can smell the green trees. There are ducks on the lakes. The sky is really 
blue." 
</P>
<P>
For many people, small-town life takes them back in time to the innocence of 
the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
When Caton, the lawyer, bought his house in Spokane, he suddenly found himself 
in the midst of a 19th-Century, New England-style white Christmas. "Every 
house," he says, "had a candle in every window," and the neighbors walked 
around singing Christmas carols. "It was like a Currier &amp; Ives painting." 
</P>
<P>
For other people, the best thing about leaving Los Angeles is the sense of 
spaciousness they now have. In Irvine, Don Smeller, a civil engineer, lived in 
a tract house right against his neighbor's lot line. "All our windows," he 
says, "faced a blank wall." 
</P>
<P>
But after selling his Irvine house for $207,000, he bought a $157,000 house on 
a hillside in an apple-growing region 150 miles east of Seattle where he now 
has "enormous picture-window" views of the mountains, the Columbia River, the 
town of Wenatchee and the mainstay of the local economy -- endless orchards. 
His nearest neighbor is a quarter-mile down the road, he says, and the main 
road is so far away his two sons ride their motorcycles to pick up the mail. 
</P>
<P>
As to what drives homeowners to cash in and bail out of Los Angeles, it isn't 
just the opportunity to live in a bigger house. If that was all there was to 
it, they would have stayed here. Instead, many people say, it was the city 
itself that drove them out with its crime, stupefying traffic, smog, stress and 
those important but hard to quantify items lumped together under the category, 
"quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
"It was all so homogeneous," Smeller says of his former life in Irvine. "All us 
40-year-old parents with our 2.1 kids. I missed having grandmas around. I 
didn't know any poor people." 
</P>
<P>
Materialism was so rampant that people were driving themselves crazy trying to 
cover big mortgages and carve out high life styles. "I know people trying to 
support $1,500 and $2,000 (monthly) mortgages," he says. "They just worked and 
worked and worked and worked." 
</P>
<P>
Some expatriates cite earthquakes as the cause of their leaving. "I have a 2 
1/2-year-old," says Parnegg, who is now an Albuquerque real estate agent. "I 
began thinking if you were 6 or 8 miles apart during a terrible earthquake, the 
whole freeway system shuts down and you can't get to your children for a couple 
of days." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Ruccione, an irate Silver Lake resident who worked in brokerage 
management in Century City, says one reason he quit his job and made plans to 
move to Puget Sound was crime: "Every house on my street has been broken into. 
My brother has been robbed twice and mugged once." 
</P>
<P>
Jill Hearing says her Garden Grove home was robbed twice: "I never met such 
brazen criminals. We couldn't leave the (front door unlocked). They would cut 
through the screen door and walk right into my house." 
</P>
<P>
Once, while she was out shopping, someone snatched her purse. At the shopping 
mall where she worked, "they were losing 12 cars a day" to thieves. Finally, 
when her husband's oil company began checking his blood for possible industrial 
toxins, she threw in the towel: "I was getting frightened for our lives. I 
said, 'Gee, we lived here all my life and they've finally chased me out.' " 
</P>
<P>
Another thing most equity emigres cite as a reason for leaving Los Angeles is 
the frustration of dealing with traffic in an increasingly frantic and 
gridlocked city. "I swear I spent half my life at red lights," Smeller says. 
</P>
<P>
Ruccione complained that three years ago he could commute from his Silver Lake 
home to his Century City office in 20 to 22 minutes. Now, he says, even at 5:30 
a.m., it takes him 40 minutes. Anytime after 3:30 p.m., his return drive took 
75 minutes, by which time he was so stressed out, he says, it took him two 
hours more to unwind. 
</P>
<P>
Ruccione says he was making great money: $140,000 a year himself, with his wife 
bringing in $50,000 more. But one-third of that sum went to taxes; 25% more 
subsidized his business. Everything was expensive. Even a cheap Century City 
lunch, he noted, cost $12. 
</P>
<P>
"I was lucky if I had $35,000 left to live on," he says. "I'd have been better 
off flipping hamburgers." 
</P>
<P>
By the time he hit 40, he also began to suffer an upset stomach and headaches. 
So he quit his job in December, put his house up for sale and began preparing 
for his move to Puget Sound. "That was Dec. 31," Ruccione says. "I haven't had 
a headache since." 
</P>
<P>
In comparison with Los Angeles, not all small-town life is paradise. Housing 
costs and insurance rates may be lower, Smeller says, but retail stores like K 
mart still charge the same prices. And anytime you need an out-of-the-ordinary 
item, it has to be brought in by special order. "If your car is laid up in 
Orange County, no problem," Smeller says. "Someone would have a part just down 
the block. Here (in Wenatchee, Wash.) they call around and call around and 
finally locate a part in Reno. Then there's a snowstorm in the mountains and 
who knows when the truck will get in." 
</P>
<P>
Many people who leave Los Angeles find they miss its sunshine. Marion Kaire, a 
former Los Angeles restaurateur who traded her $140,000 home in Sylmar for a 
$50,000 home in the pine forests of the central Oregon coast, says that the air 
is "sparkling clean" but it's also so cold and rainy there that "a lot of 
people come up here, stay for two years and then go someplace else." 
</P>
<P>
Crime in Los Angeles has always seemed worse than it is because with the city's 
huge population there's always someone somewhere pulling off a no-brainer. But 
even in smaller Portland, Ore., emigre Crips and Bloods now stage drive-by 
shootings on green tree-lined streets. 
</P>
<P>
And while some Los Angeles residents initially move out to flee the city's 
fast-paced life, they then discover to their chagrin that they miss the city's 
dynamism and drive. 
</P>
<P>
"L.A. lives, eats and breathes on change," says Parnegg, the Albuquerque real 
estate agent. "We had a real rough time adjusting. We missed the action. There 
is not that sense of infinite economic hope that you have in L.A. -- although 
you might not have gotten your screenplay or book deal signed this week, the 
possibility exists that it can happen any time." 
</P>
<P>
Even the more sophisticated towns seem provincial in comparison to Los Angeles, 
some say. "Seattle is a closed society," Ruccione says. "If you want to make it 
there, you better have a connection to the University of Washington." 
</P>
<P>
Further, big-city sophistication, far from always giving newcomers an edge, 
sometimes works against them in small towns. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to adjust yourself to a more sedate pace," Ruccione says. "Things up 
there happen on their time table, not yours, and if you push too hard, you turn 
people off." 
</P>
<P>
Jill Hearing says she lived in Washington six months before her neighbors would 
talk to her: "I didn't know when I first moved up here that Californians were 
the hated enemy. Just mention the name California and the hair goes up. In 
California, we always had more of an open mind. People accepted you as long as 
you were honorable or hard-working. Here (the attitude is), 'If my aunt doesn't 
know you and want to give you a good recommendation, we don't want to know 
you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Because of stagnant housing markets in other parts of the country, where even a 
comfortable well-built house on a friendly tree-lined street can go begging for 
a buyer for as long as a year, people who leave Los Angeles for quieter, less 
frenetic places sometimes find that the way out of town is a one-way street. In 
the time they were gone, prices have gone up so fast they now can't qualify to 
buy the house they once lived in. 
</P>
<P>
(Although Los Angeles homeowners can make big profits when selling their 
houses, unless they are 55 or older and thus eligible for a one-time deferment 
of the first $125,000 in capital gains, they must pay up to a third of their 
net gain in taxes. The only way around the IRS rule is to buy a house as 
expensive as the one you sold. The problem with that is that you end with the 
same size mortgage at a higher interest rate in a part of the country where 
wages are lower.) 
</P>
<P>
Because the economy in Los Angeles is so strong, many people make the mistake 
of projecting that vitality on the rest of the country. In fact, in many small 
towns, it can be a terrible problem finding a job. 
</P>
<P>
Smeller, who is looking for engineering work in central Washington, observes: 
"You don't see ads for professional people in the newspaper in Wenatchee. 
There's a good ol' boy network. You get your job because you know somebody." 
</P>
<P>
Despite 20 years of experience as a pipe fitter and a good work record, it took 
Hearing's husband almost a year to find work in Seattle. And when he did, it 
was a two-hour commute by bus and ferryboat from their Bellevue home. He had to 
leave at 4:30 a.m. and often didn't get back till 7 p.m., assuming there were 
no accidents on the bridge or traffic jams on the narrow two-lane roads. 
</P>
<P>
Many prices are higher in the Seattle area. Hearing pays 79 cents a pound for 
bananas, twice what she did in Garden Grove. And to heat her house with 
electricity costs $50 a week, she says, though she keeps the thermostat at a 
brisk 60 degrees and turns off the heat at night. 
</P>
<P>
If she and her husband had it do over, Hearing says, "I would not, knowing what 
I know now, come up here." 
</P>
<P>
And lots of people who need jobs, she says, apparently feel the same way. When 
she tells people she is from Los Angeles, "People say, 'Why did you ever leave 
California?' Everyone wants to go there."

INSIDE NANCY REAGAN'S WHITE HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
FORMER FIRST LADY SHARES ANECDOTES AT BLUE RIBBON LUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You imagine life in the White House has its ups and downs. But what was the 
bane of former First Lady Nancy Reagan's existence? 
</P>
<P>
"Seating State Department dinners are the bane of everyone's existence," she 
said Wednesday during an informal question-and-answer session, followed by a 
luncheon sponsored by the Blue Ribbon of the Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Topic of Discussion 
</P>
<P>
While she planned the flowers and the entertainment, the guest lists for such 
dinners, she said, were set by "a combination of a lot of people's input: the 
political department, the press, the State Department. I have a few says in 
there, but I think people usually think I have the whole say. Not true, not 
true." 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Reagan was speaking about "Inside the White House," the topic of the 
discussion. Although she has appeared at other events since she and former 
President Ronald Reagan moved back to Los Angeles, this is the first time she 
has spoken here about life in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
According to Music Center sources, she did not receive the $30,000 fee that was 
recently reported to be the charge for her speaking engagements, but she was 
made an honorary board member of the Blue Ribbon. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagans' rustic weekends at Camp David, adjusting to life outside of 
Washington and other inquiries about domesticity were among the questions asked 
by about 350 members of the Music Center support group that had gathered at the 
Mark Taper Forum in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
And while she handled the personal inquiries smoothly, Mrs. Reagan was thrown 
by the last question: What characteristics do you most admire in your husband? 
</P>
<P>
"Just a minute!" boomed a voice off stage, and out strode Ronald Reagan, 
totally surprising his wife and bringing the audience to its feet. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some things I don't tell you," he teased, as Nancy greeted him with 
a kiss. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to thank you for recognizing Nancy," he said. "I don't know of 
anyone who's more deserving of it. Being married to Nancy is like a dream come 
true, my adolescent boy's dream of what marriage should really be like. As a 
matter of fact, I have to tell you she just goes into the next room and I find 
myself missing her." 
</P>
<P>
That last sentimental anecdote drew a chorus of "Awwwwwws" and a round of 
applause. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Honest and Steadfastness 
</P>
<P>
And what does she admire about her husband? 
</P>
<P>
"His ability to surprise me," she said. "Seriously, I admire his integrity, his 
courage, his honesty, his steadfastness. I admire everything he did during the 
eight years, and before. And I'm glad he misses me when I'm in the next room." 
</P>
<P>
Sitting on stage, with the set of the Taper's "Dutch Landscape" as a backdrop, 
Reagan was joined by Blue Ribbon president Joanne Kozberg, former Blue Ribbon 
president Nancy Livingston and event chairman Marion Jorgensen. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Reagan, wearing a teal-and-black checked jacket and black skirt, was stuck 
in freeway traffic and arrived half an hour late. But her peers, who have been 
welcoming her back into the fold at other events, didn't seem to mind. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Close Call 
</P>
<P>
She asked what it was like to be in Washington when they first arrived and to 
always be accompanied by Secret Service. 
</P>
<P>
"If you remember," Mrs. Reagan said, "we'd only been there three months when by 
husband was shot. And that was a very close call, closer than most people 
realized. So I never really had perhaps the feelings that other people had 
about the Secret Service. I was glad to have them there." 
</P>
<P>
About the presidential Camp David retreat, Mrs. Reagan recalled that it's "very 
simple, really, that's its charm. Absolutely no press can come in, and very few 
people have seen Camp David. We used it as a retreat. You put on blue jeans and 
no makeup and it's a wonderful, wonderful house." 
</P>
<P>
But, she added, "The phone is always there and you're always President. It's a 
change of scenery. But it's different, the whole atmosphere is different." 
</P>
<P>
Moving out of the White House was a "bittersweet" time for Mrs. Reagan, as she 
has said on other occasions. "In all I had done, I felt that I was leaving so 
much of me there, you know what I mean?" 
</P>
<P>
Jorgensen asked if the White House had a ghost. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a saying that Lincoln's ghost is around," Mrs. Reagan replied. "The 
butlers who have been there for many, many years swear it's so, and who's to 
say?" 
</P>
<P>
She also revealed that there were few chances to really relax while her husband 
was in office. They never did putter around in the kitchen, she said, but 
eating dinner on trays in front of the TV was a treat until the President was 
called back to work. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing her work against drug abuse is still paramount, although "everything 
is a bit on hold now," she explained, "and I'm not doing as much as I'd like to 
because I'm writing a book. But I feel very, very strongly about it as you all 
know." 
</P>
<P>
What piece of advice would she give to a future White House occupant? 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it would be to be yourself, do what you're interested in, and hang in 
there." 
</P>
<P>
The luncheon drew Blue Ribbon members Jane Weintraub, Annette O'Malley, 
Rosemarie Stack, Lee Minnelli, Andrea Van de Kamp, Jane Eisner; event committee 
members Harriet Deutsch, Joan Hotchkis, Dorie Pinola (with husband Joe), Jean 
Smith, Erlenne Sprague, Chardee Trainer and Betty Wilson.

EXCLUSIVE PHOTOS CARRY THE MESSAGE OF 'ROMANCE' FOR FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTIJANE LEVINE, Times Fashion Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When fall showings begin in Europe this weekend, the world's great designers 
will once again etch their fantasies in cloth, drape them on some of the 
world's skinniest women and send them down runways to be observed by the most 
sophisticated retailers on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
It will be, as it is twice each year, an exercise in artistry rather than 
commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from these exclusive advance photos of new styles from Milan, the mood 
for fall is romantic. Shoulders are rounded; shapes are soft; draping and 
pleating and lavish use of fabric implies an overall opulence reminiscent of 
bygone eras. 
</P>
<P>
Of course buying a new look for each new season seems an antiquated notion to 
most U.S. women. 
</P>
<P>
But the idea of dressing beautifully, dramatically, distinctively or simply 
appropriately retains its allure. The business of fashion may ebb and flow, but 
the romance of it remains constant. 
</P>
<P>
How else to account for the increasing use of clothing as an indicator of 
character, status, even political leanings in the films and literature of the 
'80s? How else to account for the public's unceasing interest in all things 
related to fashion and personal style? 
</P>
<P>
And clothes as appealing as some of those shown here may just prove to be the 
catalyst needed to start U.S. women shopping again. 
</P>
<P>
Relatively few will be able to afford the real European clothes once they are 
imported by American retailers to U.S. stores. But eventually the mood and 
shape of these exquisitely crafted and expensive outfits will become the basis 
for fashions that show up at all price levels in stores around the country.

DEMOCRATS' ATTACK ON PRINGLE GETS $10,000 SHOT IN ARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA LUTHER, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County Democrats got a $10,000 boost this week in their effort to stage 
a recall of Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), who won his 72nd 
District seat last November by less than 900 votes after a bitter $1.9-million 
campaign that remains under a legal cloud. 
</P>
<P>
County Democratic Party Chairman Michael J. Balmages said Thursday that a 
couple who donated the money -- and who want to remain anonymous for the time 
being -- were upset at the hiring of uniformed security guards on Election Day 
at 20 largely Latino Santa Ana precincts in the 72nd District. The guards were 
hired by the county Republican Party at the request of Pringle's campaign 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
"They pretty much expressed outrage at the thought that Pringle would have 
hired these security guards," Balmages said of the donors, whom he described as 
a married couple. Their names will eventually have to be declared on the 
party's political finance report later this year. "They said, 'We want to do 
anything we can.' " 
</P>
<P>
Balmages said the donation -- huge by county Democratic Party standards -- will 
provide seed money for a feasibility study of a recall effort. 
</P>
<P>
The guards incident, which was widely criticized not only by Democrats but by 
Republican Party leaders around the state, has resulted in two ongoing law 
enforcement investigations. Also pending is a civil lawsuit seeking to overturn 
the election on grounds the guards allegedly intimidated first-time Latino 
voters and kept them away from the polls. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas A. Fuentes, the county GOP chairman who also is a defendant in the 
lawsuit, has said the guards were hired because of rumors that Democrats would 
bus in illegal voters to tip the election in favor of Democratic candidate 
Christian F. (Rick) Thierbach. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats were upset when Pringle topped Thierbach in the only legislative or 
congressional district in the county where it is thought a Democrat has a 
chance of winning. Thierbach lost despite voter registration favoring Democrats 
53% to 35% over Republicans -- nearly the reverse of the two parties' margins 
in the county as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
The security guard issue has provided a powerful rallying point for county 
Democrats, who last month won support at a state Democratic Party convention in 
Sacramento for the recall effort. Declaring "never again" in English and "nunca 
jamas" in Spanish, delegates to the convention agreed to provide money to 
recall Pringle or prepare to unseat him in the 1990 election. 
</P>
<P>
And, in what amounted to a test of the effectiveness of the security guard 
issue as a local fund-raising tool, the county Democratic Party raised more 
than $2,000 in small donations in December from a letter sent to only a few 
hundred Democrats around the county. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is a powerful emotional issue, and I think if we don't use it to 
raise money, we're making a mistake," Democratic activist Mike Ray said. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic stalwart Richard J. O'Neill of San Juan Capistrano said he thinks 
that about $100,000 will be needed for a recall effort, not counting the money 
to be spent by candidates running in a simultaneous special election to replace 
Pringle. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill said the $10,000 donation gives new life to the recall effort. "It 
means it's for real," he said. "If people are that much excited about it, we 
can raise that $100,000 easy enough." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Democratic candidates are lining up to run against Pringle, either 
in a recall or in the 1990 election. Santa Ana Councilman Miguel A. Pulido said 
he is considering a run. And Santa Ana businessman Jerry Yudelson, who lost his 
congressional race against Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) last 
November, said Thursday that he will announce the formation of an exploratory 
committee in 2 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's going to be a firestorm of protest votes over the Republicans' 
actions in Hispanic precincts," Yudelson said. "A lot of people who supported 
Pringle last time are going to sit on their hands this time. . . . So I think 
it's a very winnable seat for a Democrat." 
</P>
<P>
Even Thierbach would not rule out another run in the 72nd District. 
</P>
<P>
"It's in my blood," said Thierbach, who added that he is still recovering from 
the last election. "If I had to make a decision today, obviously I wouldn't do 
it. In the next 3 months, I would say no. But 6 months from now, who knows?" 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic primary may even attract a couple of Republicans willing to 
switch parties, including Robert R. Thompson, 71, associate director of the 
Golden State Mobile Home Owners League. Thompson has said he is upset about the 
security guard and other issues and will stage a candidacy if there is a recall 
against Pringle.

UCI MURAL IS NOT EVEN FINISHED YET BUT GENERATES AN UPROAR OVER IMAGES OF KKK 
AND A CHAINED WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CICCHESE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Judy Baca's intermediate art class decided to paint a mural at UC Irvine, 
students hoped it would provoke thought about social issues. 
</P>
<P>
But what the artwork on a temporary construction fence sparked were complaints 
that the mural -- which includes images of a nude woman in chains and Ku Klux 
Klan members -- is sexist and racist, plus counter-complaints of censorship. 
</P>
<P>
Since work began 2 weeks ago on the 50-foot-long, 8-foot-high mural near the 
new Physical Sciences Building and facing Aldrich Park, questions and 
complaints have rolled in to university officials. The dean of students has 
scheduled a campus forum next week to discuss the competing concerns of 
artistic freedom versus prejudice and sexism. 
</P>
<P>
The image that has received the most attention is the depiction of a line of 
KKK members following their leader, a grand wizard. Next to them is a group of 
protesters, symbolizing minority groups who have been victimized by the Klan, 
said Baca, an assistant art professor. On the chest of the lead Klansman are 
the words "Hello My Name Is Ignorance." 
</P>
<P>
Another scene some have criticized as offensive is the image of a nude woman 
chained to a house, which bears the words "Home Sweet Home." The chains are 
locked by a diamond wedding ring; over the woman's head is a key with the top 
portion in the form of an artist's palette. 
</P>
<P>
"It shows the role art plays in our life," said Neda Pourang, a senior art 
student who painted the scene. "It symbolizes the threat of (women) being 
chained down by marriage, being a housewife, and the key to unlock the chain is 
art. 
</P>
<P>
"Most women don't understand that they don't have to do that," Pourang said 
about traditional roles. "I painted her naked as a symbol of being defenseless 
and exposed." 
</P>
<P>
Since the students began to outline the mural, Ron Wilson, assistant vice 
chancellor and campus ombudsman, said he has received 17 calls complaining 
about either the KKK members or the nude woman. That is the biggest reaction to 
a visual artwork in his 11 years on campus, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"People have confronted this with an adversarial point of view," Wilson said. 
"Some people, about five or six, have called to complain, and they haven't even 
seen it yet. They have just heard about it. I had one lady call, and she said 
the depiction of a nude woman is a sin." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the callers have criticized the KKK scene. Wilson said most of the 
critical callers were black students, and some Jewish students. 
</P>
<P>
He theorized that people were reacting quickly to the mural because they have 
seen a growing number of incidents of racism and sexism across the country. 
</P>
<P>
When one woman called, he said, and told him that "she had just heard about 
David Duke being elected to the Louisiana state Legislature and read about 
Richard M. Daley (who won the Democratic primary for mayor) in Chicago saying, 
'You want a white mayor,' and 'now I see a picture of the Ku Klux Klan on 
campus. When is this crap going to stop?' " 
</P>
<P>
"They're translating it (the mural) as, 'Now it (racism) is happening here,' " 
Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that most of the complaints came before the words "Hello My Name Is 
Ignorance" were painted on the mural last week. 
</P>
<P>
However, complaints have continued since then, with callers saying that the 
mural might be glorifying the KKK, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the complaints, work started Thursday to design and distribute 
flyers to advertise an open forum at the mural at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
UCI's dean of students, Sally Peterson, said all students and faculty are 
invited to attend and to direct questions to the student artists. 
</P>
<P>
Baca and her students, however, said they would not make any major changes but 
would consider altering the mural so their message is more clear. 
</P>
<P>
She said some changes being discussed are enlarging the phrase "Hello My Name 
Is Ignorance," including a puppeteer who would be pulling the strings of the 
grand wizard and adding two figures in the Klan scene, a skinhead and a 
neo-Nazi, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Baca said this would show that prejudice continues today. 
</P>
<P>
She added that the controversy is proving educational for her students. 
</P>
<P>
But both Baca and Wilson said they are concerned by a suggestion that temporary 
works such as the mural should win approval of a special committee before the 
work starts. That is seen by some faculty members and students as a form of 
potential censorship. 
</P>
<P>
"There is discussion in that area," Wilson said. "We're talking about taking an 
elephant gun to a mouse. I'm urging that they move very carefully. 
</P>
<P>
"When you talk about something like that, you are talking about the censorship 
of the creative mind. And the way I see it, once you open up the Pandora's box 
it's very hard to get it closed again." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Black Student Union and the Women's Resource Center 
could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Bergman of the Jewish Student Union declined comment, saying she had not 
seen the mural. She did say, however, that her group would have a 
representative at Tuesday's forum. 
</P>
<P>
Baca said the purpose of the project, which should be completed in 2 weeks, is 
to give her students a venue to display their work in public. 
</P>
<P>
"No artwork is complete until someone has seen it," Baca said. "If someone's 
art is kept in the studio and seen by no one, then it is not complete."

REX, NON-SEXIST POLICE DOG, SNIFFS OUT HIS MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Ana police dog Rex got his man Thursday. Or was it a woman? 
</P>
<P>
The incident began about 9 a.m. when a patrolman spotted a suspect from a Feb. 
1 robbery driving outside a check-cashing store. The suspect slowly pulled over 
and stopped. Suddenly, he jumped from the car and ran, disappearing in the back 
yards of homes along the 2300 block of South Olive Street. 
</P>
<P>
Maureen Thomas, a Santa Ana Police Department spokesperson, said the suspect 
ran to his home at 2306 S. Olive St. 
</P>
<P>
Officers called for police dogs, but the suspect slipped out the back of his 
house and made his way through yards until he reached 2302 S. Olive. There he 
broke a window and went in, where he was spotted by officers and their dogs. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly afterwards, police spotted a person dressed in a blouse, skirt and 
panty hose leave through the back door. 
</P>
<P>
Officers might had been fooled for a second, but not Rex, who cornered the 
suspect in a nearby back yard. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested Jaime R. Perez, 18. He was treated at UCI Medical Center in 
Orange for bites on both arms. 
</P>
<P>
Police booked Perez on suspicion of strong-arm robbery in the Feb. 1 incident. 
Officers alleged Perez approached a woman outside the ABC Check Cashing store 
on South Grand Avenue in Santa Ana, shoved her against a car and took $1,500 
from her. He also was booked on suspicion of resisting arrest Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Rex, who has been on the police force for 2 years, suffered a paw injury, but 
Thomas said he was doing fine. GEORGE FRANK

JAIL TERM FOR EX-OFFICER ON SEXUAL BATTERY CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former police officer for the city of Orange who pleaded no contest to 
fondling a woman during a pat-down search while he was still a policeman has 
been sentenced to 60 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Three counts of felony sexual battery were filed against Gordon Whaley, 29, of 
Moreno Valley in October. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregory L. Prickett said Whaley pleaded no contest in 
December. A no-contest plea is tantamount to admitting guilt but can not be 
used as evidence of guilt in a civil dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Whaley left the Orange Police Department in June, one month after the alleged 
fondling occurred during a roadside search. The officer searched the 
22-year-old woman after he saw marijuana fall from the glove compartment while 
she was looking for her car registration. 
</P>
<P>
Whaley was sentenced by Superior Court Judge Myron S. Brown earlier this week.

SAN CLEMENTE VOTES TO RETAIN EMERGENCY STAFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nelda Beeuwsaert, a San Clemente police sergeant, never knew how much she was 
appreciated until the City Council in January ordered a study into whether it 
would be cheaper to do away with her job. 
</P>
<P>
The council was considering whether money could be saved by disbanding the 
city's police, fire and lifeguard departments and contracting instead with the 
county and a private company for those services. The proposal sparked a 
communitywide furor, with hundreds of angry residents calling City Hall in 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't be more grateful for the community support," said Sgt. Beeuwsaert, 
who, along with about 100 city emergency personnel, has been wondering since 
then whether she will still have employment. 
</P>
<P>
A reprieve came Wednesday night when the council, bowing to overwhelming public 
pressure, voted unanimously to drop consideration of contracting for public 
safety services. About three dozen police, firefighters and lifeguards who were 
present in the council chambers burst into applause at the voting outcome. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the 5-0 vote, Mayor Brian R. Rice warned that the issue could come up 
again, since the city is seeking ways to raise more money to provide essential 
services for its fast-growing population. The city's population has grown from 
30,000 to 37,500 since 1980, with more development on the way. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to go with the county unless there is an extreme situation," 
Rice said. "But the budget is getting tight, and that's the reason it's being 
brought up." 
</P>
<P>
Rice added that when San Clemente hires a new city manager to replace James B. 
Hendrickson, who announced his resignation several weeks ago, the manager would 
be asked to examine ways to cut the budget, and that could include doing away 
with the local emergency services. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente has operated its own police, fire and lifeguard departments since 
the city was founded in 1929. San Clemente and Laguna Beach are the only cities 
in rapidly growing south Orange County that do not contract with the county for 
emergency services. 
</P>
<P>
The cities of Dana Point, Mission Viejo and San Juan Capistrano all rely upon 
the Orange County Sheriff's Department and County Fire Department for emergency 
protection. The county contracts for beach lifeguards with a private company, 
Lifeguard International Beach Services. 
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's meeting, San Clemente Councilman Scott Diehl adamantly opposed 
even discussing about doing away with the local police, fire and lifeguard 
services, and asked that the issue not be brought up again. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Lot of Disruption 
</P>
<P>
"I am extremely happy with the organizations we have now," Diehl said. "I think 
there's been a lot of disruption to our departments (by even considering a 
change)." 
</P>
<P>
Many residents agreed emphatically with Diehl. 
</P>
<P>
"The personnel of these departments are the only city employees many of us 
recognize," Bob and Maxine Beasley wrote in a letter to the council. "Their 
badges, uniforms and vehicles identify them as being part of San Clemente. We 
like that." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Candace Haggard, who fielded more than 200 calls from like-minded 
residents, heaped praise on the uniformed emergency workers present in the 
council chambers and extended them an apology. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry this study created such morale problems," Haggard said. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Fire Chief Tom Dailey described the anxiety his 28 full-time 
firefighters had gone through in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just totally devastated us for 3 weeks now," Dailey said. "They were just 
concerned whether they'd have a job or not." 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente Police Chief Al Ehlow said his 65-member force also had been 
sweating it out. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of people anxious, wondering, 'Where am I going to be? What am I 
going to do?' " Ehlow said. 
</P>
<P>
As he spoke outside City Hall Wednesday night, an on-duty patrolman drove up in 
a squad car and gestured anxiously at Ehlow, inquiring about the outcome of the 
council's vote. He drove on when Ehlow gave him a smile and a thumbs up. 
</P>
<P>
Although police, fire and lifeguards currently employed by the city probably 
would be offered jobs under a contractual arrangement with the county Sheriff's 
and Fire departments, as happened last year in the city of Stanton, Sgt. 
Beeuwsaert said that working for a city is preferable. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just the idea of working in a small community," she said. "With the 
county, we could go to the jail or another part of the county. We would have 
less control over our assignments." 
</P>
<P>
The issue of contracting for emergency services has come up repeatedly in San 
Clemente in recent years as the city has struggled to maintain essential 
services for its rapidly growing population. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Hendrickson said the city is trying to come up with more money to 
finance such items as additional workers for parks and streets maintenance, as 
well as a new paramedic unit. The city has only one paramedic unit, and the 
cost to bring in another is estimated at about $300,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Since police, fire and lifeguard services now account for about 40% of the 
city's $16-million budget, Hendrickson said the council has focused much of its 
budget-trimming efforts there. 
</P>
<P>
At a retreat in mid-January, the council directed its staff to research the 
advantages and disadvantages to contracting out for services. Hendrickson, 
Police Chief Ehlow and Lifeguard Director Michael L. Sorg submitted reports 
which concluded that while the city could save some money by contracting out, 
it would not have as high a quality of emergency services, nor would it retain 
local control. 
</P>
<P>
Exact cost comparisons between contracting for services and keeping existing 
public safety departments were not made. Those comparisons would have to come 
from the county government, and Wednesday night, the council considered asking 
the county to conduct such a study. Instead, the council voted 5 to 0 to drop 
the matter altogether.

UNDERCOVER AGENT: GATES 'PUT BOUNTY' ON YOUNGBLOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
An undercover agent who worked with Orange County Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates' 
intelligence unit said the sheriff had "a bounty" out on then-Municipal Judge 
Bobby D. Youngblood and would "pay handsomely" for evidence that could convict 
the judge of involvement with cocaine, an attorney testified Thursday in U.S. 
District Court. 
</P>
<P>
Youngblood was a harsh critic of Gates in the mid-1980s and eventually ran 
against him for sheriff. He and other Gates election opponents sued the sheriff 
for using his intelligence unit for political harassment and won a $375,000 
settlement from the County of Orange in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's testimony came during the fourth week of a $5-million suit against 
Gates that was filed by Youngblood's former private investigator, Preston 
Guillory. Guillory alleges that Gates arranged trumped-up charges against him 
in 1985 as harassment. He later was acquitted of the charges -- impersonating a 
law officer and illegally carrying a concealed weapon. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney, James L. Ripley, who was suspended from law practice last 
February, said his friend, client and employee, Richard Wilder, had told him of 
his undercover work with the Sheriff's intelligence unit. Wilder had said he 
was "very well compensated" for that work, but had not said what the 
compensation was, Ripley testified. 
</P>
<P>
Wilder had told him that attorneys familiar with Youngblood "knew" that he was 
involved with cocaine, Ripley said. Wilder told him that "the sheriff will pay 
a very large sum of money, you could get a gun permit, all sorts of crazy 
things," if one could provide evidence, Ripley testified. 
</P>
<P>
Ripley said he thought Wilder had said "the sheriff" in his statements, but may 
have said "the sheriffs." 
</P>
<P>
In another development, U.S. District Judge Richard A. Gadbois had asked for a 
statement of Gates' financial assets, which will be submitted to the jury as a 
basis for assessing possible punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
Gates attorney, Eric L. Dobberteen, submitted the accounting Thursday but 
objected to preparations by Guillory's attorneys to dispute the statement as 
undervaluing Gates' fortune. 
</P>
<P>
Gadbois said he would not yet release the list to Guillory's attorneys, 
remarking that even by Gates' own accounting, his fortune was worth "seven 
figures" -- at least $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
"That's enough" to cover punitive damages, he told Michael J. Cisarik, one of 
Guillory's attorneys. "What do you want, blood?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," responded Cisarik, adding that he wants "whatever he (Gates) has" as 
punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
Gadbois said he would consider the matter later. 
</P>
<P>
Before testimony began Thursday, Gadbois had complained that the case had 
dragged on much too long. "We want to start to draw the string on this case," 
he said. "We have to bring this case to a close." 
</P>
<P>
But as Meir J. Westreich, another of Guillory's attorneys, bore down on 
Sheriff's Lt. Daniel J. Martini, trying to show that Martini had pressured 
witnesses to change their stories in order to incriminate Guillory, Gadbois 
sent the jury out of the courtroom and angrily rebuked the lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
"This is so damned cumulative (repetitive of previous testimony)," Gadbois 
said. "It's just totally absurd. These people (the jury) are going to rise up 
in rebellion." 
</P>
<P>
He told Westreich that if he wanted "to hash over 10 years of foolishness in 
Orange County," he should choose "some place other than Courtroom 16," Gadbois' 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any interest in spending the rest of this year trying this case. 
You'd better square around, young man," he said, glowering at Westreich. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just trying my case as best I can," Westreich replied. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys said they expect the jury to begin deliberations next Friday.

JUDGE GIVES 10-YEAR PRISON TERM TO ORGANIZER OF BOGUS TAX SHELTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Huntington Beach tax adviser who orchestrated a bogus, multimillion-dollar 
tax shelter scheme drew a 10-year prison term Thursday, maintaining until the 
end that he didn't realize that he was doing anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"I should have known better. I didn't," 68-year-old Charles D. Spurrier told a 
federal judge just before his sentence. "I'm just what I say I am -- just an 
ordinary guy who can't see how I got myself into this." 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. District Judge J. Spencer Letts drew a different portrait of the 
gray-haired Mormon as about four dozen relatives of Spurrier and his six 
co-defendants in the tax scheme listened in silence in a Santa Ana courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
"These crimes are heinous crimes," Letts declared as he railed against what he 
described as a tolerance on the part of some judges to white-collar crime. 
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, the judge said, "this was a scheme calculated to help 
criminals achieve their objective without criminal risk." On the other, he 
added, Spurrier duped "gullible victims" who believed that they were joining a 
legitimate tax-shelter program. 
</P>
<P>
Spurrier was convicted by a federal jury in December of tax evasion, fraud and 
helping others file false income statements. 
</P>
<P>
With associates in his Trust Management Group, Spurrier attracted 5,800 people 
into bogus and illegal tax shelters. One of his major operations took in $11.2 
million in clients' income, then returned $10.1 million of that total in 
nontaxable "gifts" and kept a fee for the company. 
</P>
<P>
Spurrier maintained throughout his trial that he did not realize what he was 
doing was illegal and pointed as a defense to his deep religious beliefs. He 
and his attorney, William A. Dougherty, maintained that Spurrier was convinced 
of his operation's legitimacy by the teachings of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. 
</P>
<P>
But the jury did not believe him. Spurrier faces a maximum possible sentence of 
39 years in prison and a $50,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Letts handed out a sentence that fell short of the maximum but exceeded the 
recommendation of probation officials. He declined to impose a fine against the 
now-penniless Spurrier to go along with his 10-year prison term. 
</P>
<P>
The six other family members and associates implicated in the tax scheme each 
received lesser sentences, ranging from a month in jail to several years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutor John C. Belcher said he found Letts' sentence to be fair but 
somewhat lenient -- especially in light of the sharp rebuke against 
white-collar crime delivered by the judge just before sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
"He prepared everybody for very tough sentences, but it didn't really end up 
that way," Belcher said. 
</P>
<P>
Spurrier, who remained free on bond, said in an interview after the judge's 
decision: "I think it's a fair sentence. I expected to do better, but I have no 
complaints. I'm not discouraged, and I'm not frightened." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, in a pre-sentencing statement to the judge, Spurrier continued to 
claim innocence, but added: "I'm not pleading for mercy or anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Letts said he would give him none, adding that crimes in pursuit of money are 
among the most dangerous to society. 
</P>
<P>
Of the defendants' assertions that they were ignorant of their wrongdoing, the 
judge said, "It is not uncommon for people committing a fraud to have a very 
high capability for self-delusion, as well as the ability to defraud others." 
</P>
<P>
Also sentenced Thursday on a variety of tax-fraud-related charges were: 
Spurrier's son, Dennis C. Spurrier, 34, to 3 years in prison and 5 years' 
probation; Spurrier's nephew Wayne Hill, 34, to 30 days in jail, 5 years' 
probation, a $2,000 fine and community service, and Spurrier's nephew Leon G. 
Hill, 44, to 3 years in prison, 5 years' probation and an $8,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Also sentenced were Thomas R. Smith, 37, who was given 6 months in prison and 5 
years' probation; Hyrum J. Amundsen, 75, given 3 years in prison and 3 years' 
probation, and Amundsen's wife, Eva, 64, given 30 days in jail, 5 years on 
probation and community service. 
</P>
<P>
All the defendants remained free on bond pending appeals. 
</P>
<P>
In taking the case to a higher court, defense lawyers plan to argue, in part, 
that the prosecution was tainted by information that one juror gained from 
outside the trial.

COSTA MESA SUED OVER GROWTH CURB; 
</P>
<P>
BUILDERS SAY MEASURE VIOLATES THEIR RIGHTS AND CREATES DELAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH T. YAMADA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A third local slow-growth measure came under legal attack when a builder and a 
building association filed a lawsuit Thursday against Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs believe that the city's Measure G -- passed in November, 50.2% 
to 49.8% -- is unconstitutional, a spokeswoman for the association said. 
</P>
<P>
Measure G requires developers to pay to maintain pre-development levels of 
service or a level deemed adequate by the city for police, fire and paramedic 
services and flood control. They must also not increase pre-existing traffic 
levels around their projects or, in some cases, make improvements in traffic 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's suit was filed on behalf of Frank McGavern of Corona and the 
Building Industry Assn. of Southern California Inc. in Santa Ana Superior 
Court, said Camille Courtney, a spokeswoman for the two plaintiffs and 
chairwoman of a Costa Mesa builders' advocate group called Mesa Pride. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confusion Causes Delay 
</P>
<P>
The city's confusion over how to implement Measure G, she said, caused an 
indefinite delay in approval for an industrial building that McGavern wants to 
build on Placentia Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The measure is unconstitutional because it forces property owners to pay the 
cost of improving traffic conditions that they did not create, Courtney said. 
</P>
<P>
About six other builders have contacted her with similar complaints, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Two other initiatives to control growth in local cities have been struck down 
by the courts in recent months. Measure X in San Juan Capistrano was struck 
down Feb. 21 by a county judge, who declared that it placed an unfair burden on 
future developers to solve problems with traffic, sewer and other public works 
facilities. In October, a judge struck down a San Clemente slow-growth 
initiative that had been approved by voters. 
</P>
<P>
The courtroom defeats for the local measures followed the June 7 defeat of a 
countywide slow-growth initiative by 56% to 44%. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas C. Rogers, president of Citizens for Slow Growth and Traffic Control, 
which supported the countywide measure, said the lawsuit against the Costa Mesa 
measure is unreasonable. 
</P>
<P>
The Costa Mesa plaintiffs "don't want any restrictions to build," he said. 
"They want no checks on growth. . . . The building association would file a 
lawsuit against the Ten Commandments if it inhibited them against building." 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa Councilwoman Sandra L. Genis, who supported the measure, said she 
believes that there is not enough support among other council members to 
pressure the city staff to approve the building applications in a timely way. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have political support behind (a measure), you'll find a way to 
implement it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Genis said she is confident that the initiative can withstand legal 
challenges because it differs from other county initiatives: "We don't require 
improvements over existing levels of city services or flood control. We say 
just clean up your own mess." 
</P>
<P>
Approval of about six to 12 projects have been delayed because the city could 
not assess their effects on city services, Assistant City Planning Director 
Perry L. Valantine said. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic and engineering studies can determine flood and traffic effects, he 
said. But determining a development's effect on other services is difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the technology or the methodology to see how the project will 
impact the area," Valantine said. "I don't know of anyone that has the 
capability to assess the impact of police and fire on individual projects." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Small Projects May Be Exempt 
</P>
<P>
Some small projects, such as those of less than 10,000 square feet, will not 
affect city services, traffic or flood conditions and may be exempt, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Impact studies can be conducted by the city with information at hand, he said, 
but otherwise developers are responsible for producing impact studies. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to lay the responsibility on the applicant to comply with the 
measure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A city panel is discussing ways to conduct impact studies, City Atty. Thomas C. 
Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, McGavern, who owns a glass company, is anxious to start his 
project. He said he is not interested in winning money from the lawsuit: "All I 
want is a building permit."

NEW MEXICO STATE SPOILS TITANS' STORYBOOK ENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LAS CRUCES, N.M. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With this same script, Cal State Fullerton had won other games this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans had won by coming from 13 points behind. They had won after John 
Sykes picked up a loose ball and stuffed it back in. They had won when Wayne 
Williams launched a long-range three-pointer, and sank it. 
</P>
<P>
But this time, the comeback failed. Sykes' shot rimmed out, and Wayne Williams' 
last-second three-pointer bounded off the heel of the basket just before the 
buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
Not that even the three-pointer would have been enough. Fullerton got the ball 
back for the final time trailing by four with 4 seconds left. It ended up the 
same way, with New Mexico State taking a 60-56 victory Thursday night in the 
Pan American Center. 
</P>
<P>
With that, New Mexico State clinched second place in the Big West Conference, 
winning its 19th game of the season. The Aggies are 12-5 in the Big West, 19-8 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans (14-12, 9-8) can clinch at least sixth place with a victory Saturday 
over Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"That game becomes much more important for us now, unless you start looking for 
other people to help you out," Fullerton Coach John Sneed said. 
</P>
<P>
Like several other Big West teams, the Titans are trying to finish sixth or 
better to earn a first-round bye in the conference tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Although 19 victories is the most for the Aggies since 1979, they have played 
in front of unusually small crowds, this one 7,182. The season average of 6,276 
is the lowest in 13 years, a phenomenon attributed here to everything from 
Coach Neil McCarthy's speaking fee to the flu bug to ticket-office etiquette. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the Aggies, who nearly let this one get away with poor free-throw 
shooting -- 16 of 30 in the game -- ultimately won it at the line. 
</P>
<P>
William Benjamin, a freshman who is averaging five points a game, hit both ends 
of a one-and-one with 4 seconds left to put the Aggies up by four. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was holding their breath when the little freshman walked to the 
line," McCarthy said. "But he's shooting 76%. I figured he was going to get 
these." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton trailed by five at halftime, then fell behind, 44-31, when Jeff 
McCool hit a three-pointer with 13 minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
But Fullerton pulled back into it, thanks in part to back-to-back inside 
baskets by David Moody. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans, only one for 12 from three-point range in the game, hit their one 
when Mark Hill cut the lead to 52-49 with 4:20 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton, fouling the Aggies inside, watched as the Aggies missed free throws 
-- 10 of 19 in the second half. But Fullerton never got closer than 57-56 with 
1:27 left. 
</P>
<P>
Sykes blocked a shot, and Cedric Ceballos came up with the ball and broke 
downcourt, but his on-the-move shot in the lane didn't fall. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton had one more solid chance, trailing, 58-56, with 33 seconds left. 
Hill tried a three-pointer with about 12 seconds left. Sykes picked up the 
loose-ball rebound, but also missed. Van Anderson tried once more, but his shot 
went in and out. 
</P>
<P>
As is the custom between these teams, this was a defensive game. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the best matchup zone we've seen all season," Sneed said. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy, surveying shooting percentages below 40% for both teams, also cited 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought our defensive effort wasn't too shabby. They shot 34%," he said. 
"Their's was pretty darn good, too, though. We shot 39%." 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State could be particularly proud of its success against Ceballos 
and Hill, who are the top two scorers in the Big West in conference games, 
averaging 21 and 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
Ceballos scored only 11 points, and Hill only 16. Hill made just six of 18 
shots, one of eight from three-point range. Derek Jones picked up some of the 
slack, finishing with 12. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good we held Ceballos to 12 and 11 points in our two games this year," 
McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State also managed to do a number on Fullerton on the boards, 
especially in the first half, when the Aggies outrebounded the Titans, 23-16. 
Fullerton did better in the second half, and eventually reduced the margin to 
four.

VALENCIA TAKES CARE OF CANYON WITH STIRRING DEFENSIVE EFFORT 
</P>

<P>
It was more of the same for Valencia High School Thursday night, only the 
stakes were a little higher this time around. 
</P>
<P>
Relentless determination carried Valencia past Canyon, 56-45, in the Southern 
Section 4-AA girls' championship game before 3,675 at Chapman College's Hutton 
Sports Center. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia just wouldn't give up defensively, forcing Canyon into a dismal 
20-of-59 (34%) shooting performance. 
</P>
<P>
No less impressive was senior center Kristen McDonald's work on the boards 
against a substantial height disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald was dwarfed by Canyon's 6-foot-3 Sheri Rhyne and often outnumbered, 
what with Canyon's Keri Erkenbrack and Anne Herzog draped all over her. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the 5-11 McDonald led Valencia with 23 points to go with 12 
rebounds, eight of which came on the offensive end. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Amoroso, the Tigers' feisty point guard, added 21 points, including nine 
of 11 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Amoroso had a great night," Canyon Coach Bill Fitzgibbons said. "Not 
to take anything away from their big gal (McDonald), but Amoroso is the glue 
that holds them together." 
</P>
<P>
Valencia (20-9) advances to the state regional playoffs, which begin next 
Tuesday. Canyon (22-5) must wait for an at-large berth. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers won their first girls' basketball title despite finishing in a 
second-place tie with Savanna in the Orange League. 
</P>
<P>
League champion Brea-Olinda plays for the 3-A title tonight against Atascadero. 
</P>
<P>
"We played very good man-to-man defense and made their players take some very 
bad shots," Valencia Coach Debi Woelke said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, only Rhyne, who had 10 points, shot better than 50% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
Erkenbrack also had 10 points, but was four of 12 from the floor. Christa 
Ramirez also had 10, but made four of 16 shots, including just two of 10 from 
three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia was able to connect on 20 of 45 from the field (44.4%). 
</P>
<P>
"Keri and Christa have been very consistent with that shot (three-pointers) all 
year," Fitzgibbons said. "I told them in the huddle if you have it, take it. We 
needed to score a lot of points in a hurry." 
</P>
<P>
McDonald and Amoroso had personally extended a 29-24 halftime lead to 44-30 by 
the end of the third quarter. McDonald had eight, all from within 2 feet of the 
basket, and Amoroso had seven on a mix of jumpers and twisting drives to the 
basket. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon relied on three-pointers in order to try to catch up, but the shots 
never fell and the Comanches fell further behind. 
</P>
<P>
But Canyon also had trouble when it tried to work the ball inside and exploit 
the height advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"They played a tough man-to-man and we had a lot of trouble dealing with it," 
Fitzgibbons said. "I think we should have done better." 
</P>
<P>
Amoroso's jumper to begin the second quarter put Valencia ahead for good, 
17-15. McDonald added a three-point play on an inside move and a free throw a 
moment later and the Tigers' lead was up to five. The advantage varied from 
between four and six points until the third-quarter surge led by McDonald and 
Amoroso. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia outscored Canyon, 15-6, in the third quarter as the Tigers' defense 
really clamped down. 
</P>
<P>
"We were a little worried about their size," Woelke said. "Sometimes we ended 
up with a 5-3 girl guarding a 6-footer. I don't know how we did it, but it 
worked. Maybe we wanted it more."

EASTERLY GETS SOME HELP, KATELLA TAKES TITLE;

VANCE COMES OFF THE BENCH TO PROVIDE SPARK IN OVERTIME VICTORY OVER MUIR

<P>
Joni Easterly entered Thursday's game averaging 22.8 points and 11.0 rebounds 
per game. 
</P>
<P>
She's the undisputed star of the Katella High School girls' basketball team and 
one of the best players in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Connie Vance? Well, she had made nine field goals during the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights couldn't do without either of them in the Southern Section 4-A 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
With Easterly and Vance leading the way, Katella (26-3) came from oblivion to 
defeat Muir, 54-48, in overtime in front of 3,675 at Chapman College's Hutton 
Sports Center. 
</P>
<P>
Easterly scored nine of her team's 13 points in the overtime, including three 
free throws in the final 28 seconds to clinch the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Some ball hog, huh?" Easterly said. "I was hot and I wanted the ball. When 
someone's unconscious like that, you have to get them the ball." 
</P>
<P>
The Knights rallied from a 10-point third-quarter deficit. They did it because 
of a 34-point, 12-rebound performance by Easterly and the steady play of Vance, 
a little-known, little-used point guard. 
</P>
<P>
Vance entered the game with 4 minutes 30 seconds left in the third quarter and 
the Knights trailing, 27-17. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights hadn't scored a point for 9:23 and had thrown the ball away six of 
its first nine possessions of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Connie to go in," Katella Coach Barbara Bausch said. "I didn't have to 
say anything else, she could see what was happening." 
</P>
<P>
Vance, who replaced Angie Gomez, calmed the Knights down and, even more 
importantly, got the ball to Easterly. 
</P>
<P>
Vance was responsible for only one of the Knights' 22 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Once Vance entered the game, Easterly got hot. She had scored only nine points 
in the first half, but finished the third quarter with a flurry, scoring six of 
Katella's eight points in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Easterly shot at every opportunity of the fourth quarter. She made four of six 
shots and scored 11 points, including a three-point play to put the Knights 
ahead, 40-38, with 4:19 left in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Easterly, who was doubled- and tripled- teamed most of the night, made 11 of 22 
field goals for the game. She also sank 12 of 16 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just trying to work the ball to whoever got open off the pick," Bausch 
said. "Joni just happens to be the best at that. She handles the pressure much 
better now than she did the last two years." 
</P>
<P>
After Muir's Lisa Salsman scored to tie the score, 40-40, Easterly fed Vance 
for a five-foot jumper to put the Knights ahead, 42-40. The basket nearly 
doubled Vance's scoring average (1.2) for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Salsman, who had a team-high 23 points and 15 rebounds, sent the game into 
overtime when she tied the score, 42-42, with a short jumper with 51 seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I had to play the best ball of my life in the overtime," said 
Easterly, a senior. 
</P>
<P>
Neither team was at its best in the first half, as both appeared nervous. 
</P>
<P>
Muir (23-4) tried to work the ball inside, but had little success. The Mustangs 
had 10 turnovers in the half and 15 for the game. 
</P>
<P>
Katella appeared on the verge of breaking the game open early in the second 
quarter. The Knights went on a 7-0 run to take a 17-9 lead with 4:46 left in 
the half. 
</P>
<P>
But they wouldn't score again the rest of the half. 
</P>
<P>
Following a Muir timeout, the Mustangs ran off 10 consecutive points. Salsman 
and Rose Jong each had four points during that stretch.

JOHNSON LEADS FULLERTON PAST CONTRA COSTA, 87-70 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forward Kelli Johnson scored 22 points to lead the Fullerton College women's 
basketball team to an 87-70 victory over Contra Costa in a California community 
college championship quarterfinal game Thursday night at Los Angeles Valley 
College. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (27-1) plays Los Angeles Valley, an 84-68 winner over San Mateo, in 
the semifinals tonight at 8. College of the Sequoias, an 80-61 winner over 
Golden West (14-17) earlier Thursday, plays American River in the other 
semifinal at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Hornets, who have won 18 games in a row, jumped ahead, 34-26, at halftime 
after making 14 of 32 first-half field goals. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson scored 14 points in the second half and teammate Heidi Shikuma, who 
came off the bench, scored 16 of her 17 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton led, 42-40, with 14 minutes left but went on a 9-2 run and led, 
51-42, with 11:30 left. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton Coach Colleen Riley, in her 20th season with the Hornets, said her 
team will have to play better to defeat Los Angeles Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to play very good defense because they shoot well from the outside," 
Riley said. "When you get to the semifinals, you cannot expect to play an 
average game and win." 
</P>
<P>
Steffi Strauss added 17 points for Fullerton and Lisa Crosskey had 13 points 
for the Hornets, who converted 34 of 65 field-goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
In another quarterfinal: 
</P>
<P>
Sequoias 80, Golden West 61 -- Sequoias, the top-seeded team from the north, 
led, 34-31, at halftime before going on a 8-2 run at the start of the second 
half. Golden West closed to within seven points on sophomore guard Kim Wilson's 
two free throws with 3:56 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
Sequoias outscored Golden West, 17-5, down the stretch to oust the Rustlers 
from the eight-team tournament.

CHAPMAN RESETS GOALS FOR PLAYOFFS;

<P>
PANTHERS TRY TO STAY HOT AGAINST DOMINGUEZ HILLS TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Less than a month ago, Chapman College basketball Coach Rich Prospero said it 
would be a successful season if the Panthers qualified for the California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Well, it has been a successful season. 
</P>
<P>
Now what? 
</P>
<P>
"I told our guys they've had a great season and they did much better than 
anyone expected," Prospero said. "Now, we've set new goals." 
</P>
<P>
Those goals include a victory over second-place Cal State Dominguez Hills in 
the first round of the conference playoffs. The Panthers play the Toros at 6 
tonight at Riverside Community College. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very comfortable with playing Dominguez Hills," Prospero said. "We're 
playing really good ball right now. And although Dominguez is good, they have 
not been playing at their best recently." 
</P>
<P>
Chapman (16-11) is indeed hot, having won five of its past six games to finish 
tied for third place with Cal State Bakersfield. Both teams had 9-5 conference 
records. 
</P>
<P>
Because Chapman beat Bakersfield twice, it is the third-seeded team in the 
four-team playoff. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the Panthers get to play the Toros on a neutral court, rather than facing 
first-place UC Riverside in front of a partisan crowd. Bakersfield and 
Riverside play in the 8 p.m. game. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Panthers couldn't even beat Dominguez Hills at Chapman this 
season, so the neutral court theory might not mean much. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still better than playing Riverside in front of their people," Prospero 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Prospero said the Panthers need two things in order to upset Dominguez Hills 
(19-8). 
</P>
<P>
 -- A good game from Bryan Richetto, Chapman's point guard. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A bad game from Anthony Blackmon, the Toros' 6-foot-7 center. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackmon problem might be out of the Panthers' hands. He leads the 
conference in scoring (19.3 points per game) and rebounding (9.9 per game). 
</P>
<P>
Blackmon is supported well by guard Robert Barksdale, who averages 13 points a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we did a pretty good job on Blackmon the last time we played them," 
Prospero said. "Barksdale killed us." 
</P>
<P>
The Richetto matter might be more crucial. When he plays well, the Panthers 
usually win, or at least they stay close. 
</P>
<P>
A 6-foot-4 sophomore point guard, Richetto was second in the conference in 
assists, averaging 5.6 a game. He also is a good outside shooter, plays tough 
defense and runs the transition game well. 
</P>
<P>
Trouble is, there are nights when he does none of that. 
</P>
<P>
Against Bakersfield on Saturday, Richetto so infuriated Prospero that he was 
benched for nearly 5 minutes in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Bryan Richetto of that night shows up, we're in trouble," Prospero 
said. "If the Bryan Richetto who played against (Cal Poly) San Luis Obispo or 
(Cal State) Northridge is there, we'll be all right. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone else is playing real well right now. We just have to wait and see 
which Bryan shows up." 
</P>
<P>
In the second game, Riverside (23-6) could have problems against Bakersfield 
(20-7). 
</P>
<P>
Although Riverside was ranked No. 1 in the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
Division II poll most of the season, the Highlanders lost two of their final 
five games -- including one to Bakersfield two weeks ago.

WITHOUT A WILL, THERE'S LITTLE WAY; 
</P>
<P>
MAKING ONE NOW SAVES MAJOR TROUBLE LATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALBERT B. CRENSHAW, The Washington Post 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Where there's a will there's a way -- to leave your property to those you want 
to have it after you die and to minimize the tax bite in doing so. 
</P>
<P>
But where there isn't a will, the way is set by state law, and the courts 
decide who gets what. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't make a will, the state has one for you," said H. Lynn Hopewell, a 
financial planner based in Falls Church, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Although the term "estate planning" often is used to mean estate tax planning, 
Hopewell and other planners and accountants emphasize that non-tax 
considerations are just as important. 
</P>
<P>
"Wills don't avoid taxes per se," Hopewell said. "They just guarantee that what 
you want to happen to your assets actually happens." 
</P>
<P>
Contemplating death, which wills force you to do, is never pleasant. This, and 
the complexity of the subject, means that many people, even very well-to-do 
ones, don't have wills. If you are among these, you should have one prepared 
without delay. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Job for an Expert 
</P>
<P>
And remember, this is a job for an expert. There are some do-it-yourself guides 
to will-writing, but state laws and personal circumstances differ so much that 
it is much safer to have a lawyer do it. If you don't know a lawyer, your local 
bar association can provide you with names of qualified practitioners. 
Financial planners and accountants can be helpful also, especially in the tax 
aspects of estate planning. 
</P>
<P>
If you have young children, a will is particularly important. Suppose you and 
your spouse are killed in a car crash tomorrow -- who will raise your kids? 
Absent a will, a court will decide. Do you want your relatives fighting over 
your children, or worse yet, fighting to unload them on one another? 
</P>
<P>
While the likelihood of both parents dying at once is relatively remote, it is 
a contingency you should deal with. If you are a single parent, a will becomes 
even more important for the sake of your children. 
</P>
<P>
Think about who among your relatives gets along well with your children and is 
physically and financially able to bring them up. Talk to those you think best 
suited. Are they willing to take on this responsibility? Such a decision should 
be a fully informed one on both your parts -- you don't want your children 
going either where they aren't wanted or where they weren't expected. 
</P>
<P>
Planning for the disposition of your assets is a related question. Such devices 
as trusts and powers of appointment can provide survivors with the protection 
and-or flexibility you desire. Your relatives may be more willing and able to 
take care of your children if the little ones come with a trust fund to help 
pay some of their expenses. And you may rest more easily knowing that if the 
worst were to happen, your relatives wouldn't be able to blow your kids' money 
and leave them penniless. 
</P>
<P>
"The proper view of estate planning is to find out how you want your assets to 
flow and what types of control you want to exercise, basically, from the 
grave," said David M. Bradt Jr., a tax expert with the accounting firm of 
Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Who Owns What 
</P>
<P>
The first step, he said, is to "find out what everybody (in the family) owns 
and how they own it" because "the form of ownership will dictate the flow of an 
asset even if there is a will to the contrary." 
</P>
<P>
For example, assets owned jointly with someone else -- a spouse, for instance 
-- will move directly to the surviving joint owner despite what the will may 
say. 
</P>
<P>
Bradt said it is not uncommon to find couples with everything in joint 
ownership -- house, bank accounts, stocks, the whole works. Although there is 
an unlimited marital deduction -- assets pass from one spouse to the other 
without tax -- if everything ends up in the name of the surviving spouse there 
can be a big tax hit when that spouse dies unless adjustments are made. 
</P>
<P>
It is also necessary to try to figure out what your assets are worth -- and not 
merely what they are worth today in cash, but also what additional assets gain 
value at death. 
</P>
<P>
Kathryn Ioannides of the College for Financial Planning in Denver points to 
life insurance as such an asset. A whole-life policy that might have a modest 
current cash value blossoms into a large asset at death. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, she said, one should make sure to include any annuities, pension 
survivor benefits and other items that may not come to mind right away in a 
list of one's assets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sharp Tax Reduction Possible 
</P>
<P>
Federal law provides a credit for estates that effectively exempts from 
estate-taxation the first $600,000 of assets. By judicious use of the marital 
deduction and various kinds of trusts, it remains possible to eliminate or 
sharply reduce taxes on most small-to-medium-size estates. 
</P>
<P>
But as Ioannides said, "Don't let the tax tail wag the (estate) dog." The 
proper goals of any wills, trusts and other devices should be first to make 
sure that assets go to the heirs you choose and that no loved one is left 
without adequate assets or income simply to avoid taxes. 
</P>
<P>
And Hopewell noted that with people living longer, they more often need ways of 
protecting their assets before they die. "In many states it's all too easy (for 
an ill or elderly person) to be declared incompetent," he said.

WEST NEWPORT OIL CO. WANTS TO BE MORE CONSIDERATE TO ITS NEIGHBORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In the beginning -- which for purposes of development pretty much means the 
1950s in Orange County -- nobody really cared where developers laid out 
subdivisions or erected stores. There was plenty of room, traffic was not a 
problem and most people thought all those new houses and stores and factories 
were a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, putting a convenience store in some neighborhoods -- let alone an 
office building -- can mean a pitched battle with the neighbors. After years of 
growth, many of those neighborhoods are fighting back. 
</P>
<P>
So the smarter developers are defusing the opposition by listening to neighbors 
and, in some cases, compromising by scaling back their plans. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes West Newport Oil Co., which wants to head off the controversy before 
it gets started. West Newport, you see, owns a piece of land with a lot of 
potential for controversy, a 500-acre coastal oil field between the western 
edge of Newport Beach and the Santa Ana River. The oil company has been talking 
to Orange County officials for a year about getting permission to build 
something on the land once the oil is gone in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
This week, in an unusual move, the company had its market research firm send 
out 2,500 questionnaires to homes in nearby neighborhoods in Costa Mesa and 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Be assured that your opinions, and those of your neighbors, will be considered 
before any plan is proposed to the community," the questionnaire assures 
readers. 
</P>
<P>
The five-page questionnaire asks neighbors to rate how interested they are in 
what happens to the land and also asks whether they would prefer offices, light 
industrial, houses, condos, a shopping center, a park or -- in what seems like 
the unlikeliest possibility of all -- restoration of the wetlands.

SILVERCREST AGREES TO SELL UNIT MANUFACTURING MOBILE HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Silvercrest Industries Inc. of Santa Ana said Thursday it has agreed to sell 
its mobile home manufacturing subsidiary, a move that would reduce the 
company's interests to the ownership and operation of mobile home parks. 
</P>
<P>
First Capital Acquisitions Inc. in Los Angeles has agreed to pay $1 million for 
the operation and assume $14 million of debt, according to Silvercrest. 
</P>
<P>
Silvercrest placed the manufacturing subsidiary on the block last year. The 
unit accounts for more than three-quarters of Silvercrest's sales and profits. 
</P>
<P>
Without the subsidiary, Silvercrest will "not have any significant ongoing 
business operations," the company said, although it will continue to own and 
operate some mobile home parks. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Silvercrest sold its interest in a big mobile home 
subdivision in the San Fernando Valley after being accused of fraud in a 
lawsuit by its partner, giant Los Angeles home builder Kaufman &amp; Broad Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Publicly held Silvercrest lost $2.1 million on sales of $55.3 million last year 
and has had a recent series of financial setbacks.

GARDEN GROVE COUNCIL VETOES GROUP'S TAX PLAN TO SUPPORT THE ARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Confusion among members of an arts advisory committee over the city of Garden 
Grove's taxing policies has put in limbo the issue of municipal support of the 
cultural arts. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, the City Council voted to "receive and file" recommendations of 
a 15-member Blue Ribbon Committee for the Arts, at the same time rejecting the 
report's key provision: a 1.5% increase in the hotel and motel occupancy tax 
with proceeds allocated to permanent funding of the arts. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing that's going to happen now until we get direction from the 
(City) Council," Michael D. Fenderson, assistant city manager, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, some committee members learned for the first time that city law 
requires all new tax measures whose proceeds are designated for a particular 
purpose to be placed on the ballot and passed by two-thirds of those voting. 
Citing the present anti-tax mood of the electorate, at least one council member 
who supports municipal-arts funding joined opponents in voting 3 to 2 against 
putting the measure on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The tax measure was designed to provide a permanent, annual fund of $172,000 to 
support the Grove Shakespeare Festival, the Garden Grove Symphony and other 
community arts organizations. 
</P>
<P>
With such an annual fund and a new panel responsible for administering 
subsidies, individual groups would not have to appear before the City Council 
each year to request support. In the past, such requests have divided the 
council, sometimes with considerable acrimony. The council majority has voted 
over the last 2 years to steadily reduce funding to the arts. 
</P>
<P>
After Tuesday night's action, according to Richard Hain, president of the 
symphony board, "It's all back to what we've done in the past -- going to the 
City Council to ask for funds. That's what we were trying to get away from." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor W. E. (Walt) Donovan said he voted against the proposal because he 
"didn't want to lock in a revenue source just for the arts." 
</P>
<P>
Donovan pointed out that if the measure became law and additional hotels were 
built in the city, the fund might automatically jump to $500,000 or more, 
without the approval or control of the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Frank Kessler, one of the council's strongest supporters of the 
arts, said Thursday that he voted against the tax proposal because he believes 
that "there is a more realistic way to address the thing than the ballot. . . . 
A lot of the arts committee was unaware that it would take a two-thirds vote." 
</P>
<P>
But Kessler said he was concerned that if the City Council did not act in some 
way on the issue of municipal support for the city's arts groups, "we could 
lose some of these very fine organizations to other cities who are willing to 
support them." 
</P>
<P>
"The greatest disappointment," Hain said, "is that after all the time and 
effort and research put in (to) making the report, we didn't seem to receive 
any kind of vote of appreciation from the City Council for what we had done."

PACIFIC SYMPHONY TACKLES ROSSINI, MOZART, SHOSTAKOVICH AND BOCCHERINI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HETTMANSBERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pacific Symphony gave its patrons a healthy dose of the music-making basics 
-- an acceptable stylistic approach, correct balance and all the right notes -- 
plus that intangible X-factor -- artistic charisma, or call it what you will -- 
on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Guest conductor Vakhtang Jordania opened the program at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa with a robust reading of Rossini's 
Overture to "La Gazza Ladra." The Segerstrom Hall acoustics revealed bracing 
tuttis and charming wind solos, but ragged ensemble mitigated against this 
being anything more than a warm-up. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Viktoria Mullova, to essay Mozart's Violin Concerto in A, K. 219. She 
possesses a fluent technique, with telling command of articulation. The tone is 
sweet and the intonation impeccable. 
</P>
<P>
Yet when it was over, one was left with the feeling that this was not Mozart -- 
just the notes Mozart wrote. Everything was in its proper place, including the 
standard 19th-Century cadenzas, but the interpretation was soulless. 
</P>
<P>
Using appropriately reduced forces, Jordania accompanied neatly. Only the 
famous Turkish section of the rondo added spice. 
</P>
<P>
Given his background (defecting from the Soviet Union to the United States in 
1983), it came as no surprise that Jordania has an affinity for Shostakovich, 
in this case the Symphony No. 5. However, it was not simply a matter of an 
artist feeling at home with a compatriot's work. 
</P>
<P>
The polished ensemble playing, the bite and soar of the strings and the overall 
intensity of the group attested to the fact that Jordania had communicated his 
convictions to the players -- and thus to the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Conducting imperiously, he even managed the near-impossible: persuading the 
listeners that the finale is not cheap, special-effects bombast, but a logical 
resolution of the work. 
</P>
<P>
Lacking only more finely honed brasses (though the horns on several occasions 
produced sonic thrills), the ensemble sounded like a new orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
An arrangement for the full strings of Boccherini's Minuet from the Quintet, 
Opus 13, No. 5, proved a stylish encore.

CHICAGO ENSEMBLE IN BEVERLY HILLS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Select," in the sense of choice and stylish, would be a good comprehensive 
term for the concert that the Chicago Symphony Chamber Ensemble performed in a 
ballroom at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The sponsor was the Chamber Music in Historic Sites series. The erstwhile 
ballroom may not be precisely a historical site, but considering how well it 
all worked, some semantic flexibility may be allowed. The music was choice, the 
performances were choice, and the room seemed to suggest a new and eventually 
popular site for music. 
</P>
<P>
The program will be repeated Sunday afternoon at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
The five members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra Chamber Ensemble are: David 
Taylor, violin; Robert Swan, viola; Gary Stucka, cello; Michael Henoch, oboe, 
and Andrea Swan, piano. Plainly these musicians derive from a substantial 
tradition. Their tones blend easily, they phrase with unanimity and there are 
no jarring individual opinions as to tempo, dynamics and general interpretive 
conception. 
</P>
<P>
Dire traffic on roadways approaching the Four Seasons precluded a complete 
hearing of the opening Quartet for Oboe and Strings in B-flat, by Haydn. In 
what was heard, the oboe sound of Henoch was crisp, clear and neatly modulated. 
</P>
<P>
The oboe also became a leading voice in two Rhapsodies for Oboe, Violin and 
Piano by the once highly respected turn-of-the-century American composer 
Charles Martin Loeffler. The music owes considerable debt to Debussy and his 
followers and is craftsman-like and agreeable to the ear. 
</P>
<P>
The violin and viola of Taylor and Swan came together in Mozart's Duo in G, K. 
423, a bit more scholarly than lighthearted, but nicely adjusted by the two 
string players. 
</P>
<P>
The towering masterpiece of the agenda, however, was Mendelssohn's magnificent 
Trio No. 1 in D minor, which was given a superior reading by Taylor and Stucka 
with Swan supplying an uplifting piano part. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago Symphony Chamber Ensemble will play Sunday at 2 p.m. at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $6 
to $20. Information: (714) 556-2787.

2 COUNTY ESTABLISHMENTS METE OUT SOME PRETTY GOOD VEGETARIAN FARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Max Jacobson

<TEXT>
<P>
Vegetarian friends visited me last week, and with them came the problem of 
finding a restaurant where they would be comfortable. It's not that vegetarian 
dishes are hard to find; any Chinese, Indian or Middle Eastern restaurant, for 
example, has a good variety of meatless specialties. But for many lacto-ovo, 
vegan, macrobiotic and other label-specific vegetarians, variety is not the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
Rutabegorz in Fullerton looks as if it belongs on an ivy-covered New England 
campus -- a dark, wooded shed-like dining room on a quiet, tree-lined street 
just a block or two, in fact, from the campus of Fullerton College. It's a 
casual place; you seat yourself, and all the waiters wear T-shirts and 
comfortable shoes. Our waiter had a pony tail, and a calming, professional 
demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
The menu is a 15-page paper booklet that includes several non-veg items, mostly 
of the salad/sandwich variety. My friends, David and Caren, begged me not to 
try them -- and a misbegotten seafood salad, topped with a tasteless mixture of 
crab and shrimp, told me I should have listened. Meanwhile, David and Caren 
busied themselves with crisp tossed greens with tomato, sunflower seeds, 
alfalfa sprouts and sliced cucumber. The dressings on their salads -- tahini 
poppy seed and a sesame honey ginger -- were delicious. 
</P>
<P>
Next came main courses, and more points for their side. I bit into a sandwich 
called "the walnut that kissed the chicken" (chicken, walnuts, sprouts and 
lettuce on squaw bread) and wondered why I could barely taste the large hunks 
of chicken. When I asked the waiter if the chicken had been frozen, he replied, 
"Yes, but it should be thawed by now." 
</P>
<P>
David just smirked as he enjoyed a simple, well-prepared vegetarian chili: 
pinto beans with two cheeses, sliced onion and fresh olive in a strong, hot 
sauce. Caren sympathetically offered me some of her giant stuffed mushrooms 
with vegetable-bread crumb filling; I accepted gratefully. 
</P>
<P>
And that's about what to expect: The restaurant's meatless dishes are a far 
better indicator of the kitchen. Stuffed squash and vegetarian lasagna make 
filling, tasty meals. The tostada, enchilada and Mexican casserole, despite a 
surfeit of gooey cheese, have a nice mix of flavors. My advice is not to bother 
with the restaurant's frozen turkey breast, tired cubed chicken or tasteless, 
shredded seafood. They will only serve to make your veggie friends say "I told 
ya so." 
</P>
<P>
Desserts at Rutabegorz taste like goodies from a church bake sale. Cheesecake 
is light, lemony and fresh. Carrot cake, a tall square piece cut out of a giant 
loaf pan, has lots of nuts and a moist, springy texture. Apple pie is served in 
a gigantic slice, with a dry crumb topping and finely chopped fruit, 
Pennsylvania Dutch country-style. There is an interesting assortment of creamy 
cappuccino drinks (heavily doctored with ice cream and/or chocolate and/or 
cinnamon) and ciders, too, even if they are not entirely in harmony with the 
purists. Caren smiled beatifically when I kept my order simple and had a nice 
cup of herbal tea instead. 
</P>
<P>
The Greenery Natural Kitchen looks more like what my friends are used to: a 
modest, unadorned restaurant with abundant potted plants, a few plain tables 
and some scuffed-up wooden chairs. This time, I promised them that our dinner 
would be entirely meatless. 
</P>
<P>
The first things to arrive via the sluggish service were the fresh-pressed 
juices. Carrot juice was sweet and fresh, but aloe vera juice was less 
appealing -- it may be great for sunburns but as a drink, well, it tastes 
vaguely like a cranberry-flavored health tonic. 
</P>
<P>
The salads were next, and, as at Rutabegorz, they were fresh and crisp. But 
this time, the tomato was remarkably flavorful and the dressing, a delightful 
creamy herb, was virtually oil-free. A side order of cottage tofu with abundant 
dill made an interesting if eccentric side dish. 
</P>
<P>
David tried the unburger (a throwback to his days as a meat-eater) and seemed 
to like it. It's large patty made from ground nuts, brown rice and seasonings, 
topped with a grilled slice of onion and a thin slice of melted cheese. I found 
it interesting and a bit on the heavy side, with a texture at once crunchy and 
creamy. It does not taste remotely like the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
Caren, meanwhile, busied herself with the lentil burrito, a savory mixture of 
stewed, spiced lentil with guacamole, salsa and melted cheese on a whole-wheat 
tortilla. I tasted it and it was delicious. I would happily forswear most meat 
dishes in its place. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Greenery is more subtle in its use of cheese than most vegetarian 
restaurants, I noticed that, as at Rutabegorz, cheese was present on almost 
every entree. Perhaps this is because the kitchens are trying to satisfy the 
richer diets of non-vegetarians like me. But I, for one, could do without it. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in fact, whenever I drop by these restaurants, I look for cheeseless 
dishes. The Greenery has a few: eggplant quiche, light and custardy with a 
thin, buttery crust on the bottom; Popeye salad -- fresh spinach, mushroom, 
carrot, tomato, green onion and egg with a tangy lemon and honey dressing, and 
steamed vegetables with brown rice. That last one is best; pinto beans are 
cooked together with the rice, like a Cuban congri, and the vegetables are 
fragrant with clear tastes. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen here is considerably more accomplished than the one at Rutabegorz. 
Most of the dishes are delicate, and someone behind the stove has a real way 
with combining flavors. As at Rutabegorz, there are tuna, chicken, and turkey 
salads, but I didn't taste them. Sorry, Caren. Next time I want a protein-rich 
meal, I'm going out for a steak. 
</P>
<P>
Both restaurants are inexpensive, with few dishes over $5. Rutabegorz has beer 
and wine; the Greenery does not.

ANN CONWAY: WILSON FETE DELAYED BY TOWER BATTLE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Due to his detainment in Washington to participate in the debate on John 
Tower's nomination for defense secretary, Sen. Pete Wilson's "Special Evening 
in Orange County to Retire the 1988 Debt" has been postponed until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The two-part gala fund-raiser, originally planned for last night, will be held 
at the Emerald Bay homes of builders Jim and Al Baldwin. A $250 per-person 
cocktail bash will be staged at Jim and Nancy Baldwin's granite-smothered manse 
at 4:30 p.m. At 7 p.m., just a few doors away, Deeann and Al Baldwin will host 
the $1,000-per-person sit-down dinner. 
</P>
<P>
On the pricey menu (besides dreams of Wilson someday becoming governor of 
California): romaine lettuce with mandarin orange sections, almonds, avocado, 
mushrooms and poppy seed dressing; grilled herb bread; filet mignon with 
rosemary-laced cognac sauce and chicken breast with tarragon sauce; wild rice 
pancakes and a dessert to campaign for -- flambe of bananas and oranges with 
Grand Marnier, all spilled over vanilla ice cream and crepes. 
</P>
<P>
The benefit for Wilson was the hot topic at a recent party in the Laguna Beach 
area. "It's interesting to me that the fund-raiser is being staged in the heart 
of Ueberroth country," said one guest, referring to the fact that Baseball 
Commissioner Peter Ueberroth resides in Emerald Bay. "Wonder if Ueberroth will 
run for governor," asked another. "If he does, I'll vote for him," said one 
Emerald Bay resident. "I think he's going to wait four years," ventured 
another. "Well, I'd say his time has come," said another. 
</P>
<P>
On Wilson's Emerald Bay benefit committee: George Argyros, Donald Koll, Kathryn 
Thompson, Michael Parker, William Lyon, John Lusk, Donald Bren, Gavin Herbert 
and Gene Autry. 
</P>
<P>
How sweet it is: The Irvine Co. has offered restaurateur Rex Chandler a cool $2 
million to open a nightclub-version of his ultra-popular The Rex restaurant -- 
one of Donald Bren's favorite hangouts -- at Newport Center Fashion Island. 
Chandler will serve up an additional one million and the eatery-cum-dance floor 
(with live entertainment) will open sometime next year. Earlier this week, 
Chandler said he plans to hang onto the existing Rex, located near the Newport 
Pier. "But we'll give it a new name and make it more casual," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Would he miss its romantic ocean view? "The new place will have an incredible 
view," Chandler said. "It will be built on the second story and during the day 
guests will be able to see Newport Bay and at night, city lights. At our 
present spot, there is no night-time view." The boyish-looking Chandler began 
his restaurant career in Hawaii where he operated the Rex and Nick's Fish 
Market in the Waikiki Beach area. 
</P>
<P>
Taking Manhattan: There were only smiles at Dan Camp's going away party on 
Tuesday night at the Newport Beach home of good friends Scott and Mary Lou 
Hornsby. "But I'm sort of laughing on the outside and crying on the inside," 
whispered one guest. Camp, the extremely affable manager of the Four Seasons 
Hotel in Newport Beach for the past 2 1/2 years, has been named managing 
director of the Carlyle Hotel in New York. "The hotel where Nancy Reagan is 
checking in tomorrow night," said Camp, who added he was sad to be leaving so 
many good Orange County friends but "pretty excited about the Carlyle." 
</P>
<P>
Among guests toasting Camp's good fortune (the Carlyle, Camp said, has the 
highest repeat patronage of any hotel in Manhattan and its only Mobile Five 
Star rating) were Mary and James Roosevelt, who frequently dine at the Pavilion 
restaurant at the Four Seasons; Maruja and Dr. George Hodges (who plan to hole 
up at the Carlyle and hang out at its famous Bemelman's bar in September); Bill 
Voit (of rubber company fame); Ileane and Nick Doolin; Susan and Kevin Consey, 
director of the Newport Harbor Art Museum; Maria Crutcher; Sandra Brodie; Dori 
and Jack deKruif; and Paul and Virginia Knott Bender.

Almost 20 years have gone by since parents collected funds to fight the Tustin 
School District dress code. In 1971 there were very strict dress codes 
throughout the county school system. Boys' hair could not extend over the 
collar or ears and girls' skirts could not be above the knee. 
</P>
<P>
Now the emphasis is more on learning and attending classes and less on hair 
styles and attire. Rules and regulations that might have kept some students 
</P>
<P>
from attending classes because of their clothing or hair no longer exist. 
</P>
<P>
The final word of what is acceptable and what is not lies with the principal of 
each school. Some schools are willing to accept purple, green and orange hair 
and skirts at any length, while in a few schools that would be taboo. Here is a 
list of all Orange County school districts and their current dress codes:

AUTUMN CROCUS (Colchicum autumnale): 
</P>
<P>
The toxic properties of this flowering bulb -- not a true crocus at all, but a 
lily -- have been known since medieval times, and the plant has been used in 
folk remedies and in witches' potions. Today, the toxic alkaloid colchicine 
found in the plant is used to combat gout and in treating a kind of cancer, 
granulocytic leukemia. Concentrated in the bulb, the toxic element in the 
autumn crocus can cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, trembling, 
paralysis, coma and even death if enough is ingested.

Participating high school students in grades nine through 12 will be tested on 
their knowledge of American history, geography, current events and issues, 
American government, economics and American culture in California Citizen Bee 
regional competitions Saturday. The Citizen Bee is a nationwide competition

facing it. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
Participating students receive cash awards and certificates of commendation. 
Cash awards in various sizes are presented to school, regional and state

national winner will receive a $7,000 scholarship, and second- and third-place 
finishers will receive $5,000 and $3,000 scholarships, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The national Citizen Bee was developed in 1985 by the Washington-based, 
nonprofit, nonpartisan Close Up Foundation, the nation's largest civic 
education foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos High School senior Kathy Fitzer has been named winner of the 
California Youth Services Network Roger Injayan Youth Participation Award. 
</P>
<P>
The award is given to young people who participate in volunteer activities that

BONSAI -- TRICKY, DEMANDING; 
</P>
<P>
IT TAKES A CERTAIN FEELING, LOTS OF TENDING AND INFINITE PATIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bonsai is not a hobby for everyone. The art of dwarfing and shaping trees in 
shallow pots requires a certain feel for each tree's possibilities, as well as 
an artistic appreciation of form and, most of all, patience. 
</P>
<P>
Practitioners of bonsai must water and tend to their plants daily, and it may 
take years for a plant to attain its optimum form and beauty. 
</P>
<P>
Bonsai trees cultivated by masters of the art will be on display from 10 a.m. 
to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday at Bowers Museum, 2002 N. Main St., Santa Ana. 
The bonsai show will feature a demonstration at 1:30 p.m. Saturday by Miyaji 
Nakata, a visiting bonsai master from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
If you are interested in trying your hand at the ancient art of bonsai, joining 
a club is perhaps the easiest way to start. 
</P>
<P>
There are three clubs in Orange County that belong to the Golden State Bonsai 
Federation, an educational organization composed of 60 clubs with more than 
2,500 members. 
</P>
<P>
The three local bonsai clubs -- Kofu Bonsai Kai, the Orange County Bonsai 
Society and the Orange Empire Bonsai Society -- together have an estimated 300 
members. All three clubs sponsor events to introduce people to bonsai. 
</P>
<P>
On March 25 at 6 p.m., Kofu Bonsai Kai will hold a free workshop for beginners 
at Mercury Savings, 7812 Edinger Ave., Huntington Beach. Three bonsai teachers 
will show techniques to beginners and intermediate students. For more 
information, call Larry Ragle at (714) 497-5626. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Bonsai Society, which meets monthly in Costa Mesa or Garden 
Grove, will present a bonsai show from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. May 20 and 21 at the 
Orange County Buddhist Church, 909 S. Dale St., Anaheim. The show will include 
a plant sale and bonsai demonstrations at 2 p.m. each day. For more 
information, call Corrine Woods at (213) 596-7922. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Orange Empire Bonsai Society, which meets monthly in La Habra, 
will show their works at "The Green Scene" from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. April 22 and 
23 at Cal State Fullerton's Arboretum. For more information, call Harold 
Blumberg at (213) 947-4860. 
</P>
<P>
Community colleges also offer courses in bonsai. For example, Cypress College 
will offer a 10-week bonsai course during the spring quarter beginning March 
27. The instructor will be Ernie Kuo, a student of bonsai masters Harry Hirao 
and John Naka. The class is open to beginning, intermediate and advanced 
students. For more information, call (714) 995-2771. 
</P>
<P>
If you would like to enjoy the fruits of bonsai, but don't have the patience to 
invest years of effort, you might consider buying a bonsai tree. But remember, 
this is a living art form, and the plants require constant care. Also, bonsai 
trees usually cannot survive more than a few days indoors. 
</P>
<P>
There are at least three nurseries in Orange County that offer a wide variety 
of bonsai trees and a colorful selection of bonsai pots from Japan. They are: 
</P>
<P>
Murata Bonsai Gardens, 13631 Beach Blvd., Westminster, which sells only bonsai 
trees. Owner Jim Murata says many of his customers purchase the trees as gifts 
for weddings or other holiday occasions. Bonsai specimens in Japanese maple, 
Chinese elm, Japanese elm, junipers and Japanese black pines are available. 
Most of the trees sold by Murata are in the $30-to-$100 range, but more 
expensive bonsai trees are also available. Murata Gardens offers monthly 
classes in bonsai and, according to Murata, provides individualized 
instructions to bonsai purchasers on how to care for their plants. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills Nursery, 23002 El Toro Road, El Toro, which offers bonsai trees 
ranging from small junipers at $30 to Japanese pines at $1,000. The nursery 
sells books on bonsai care. 
</P>
<P>
Roger's Gardens, 2301 San Joaquin Hills Road, Corona del Mar, which sells 
bonsai trees ranging from $15.99 to $250. Varieties of junipers, maples, 
azaleas and even eucalyptus are available. Roger's Gardens provides written 
instructions on bonsai care at no charge.

UCLA track Coach Bob Larsen said Thursday that Francis' remarks were erroneous 
when he said it was impossible to compete in track and field at the world-class 
level without the aid of chemical substances. 
</P>
<P>
Larsen said that four of his athletes, Steve Lewis, Danny Everett, Mike Marsh, 
and Kevin Young, represented the United States in the Seoul Olympics and were 
tested extensively during training and while competing, especially Lewis, the 
gold medalist in the 400 meters. 
</P>
<P>
"We're on e of the few schools that test for anabolic steroids, or any 
performance-enhancing drugs," Larsen said. "It's random unannounced (testing) 
all during the training phases and going into the competition phases. When 
Francis said it was impossible to compete at a world-class level without 
performance enhancing drugs, I know that's wrong. I don't know how many people 
are clean, but I know our four people were clean." MAL FLORENCE

SHERMAN OAKS PUPILS AID FUNERAL

<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Classmates of an 11-year-old girl killed in a drive-by shooting were collecting 
money today to help pay for her funeral, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators and students at Riverside Drive Elementary School in Sherman 
Oaks decided earlier this week to help pay for the funeral of Jasmine Guevara, 
who was gunned down last Saturday as she and two family members walked along a 
street in the Pico-Union area of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Principal Gary Parks said letters were sent home with students on Tuesday 
asking parents for their help in assisting the victim's family with the cost of 
the services, which were conducted this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Parks said he got the idea to raise money for the family after talking with the 
victim's mother, Emilia Quintanilla. "The family could use some economic help," 
Parks said. "We decided it was appropriate to do this under the circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Parks said students who rode the bus with Jasmine from her Los Angeles 
neighborhood to the Sherman Oaks school as part of a voluntary transfer program 
had informed a teacher's aide about the incident.

GIRL LOSES ARM IN CAPISTRANO CRASH

A 14-year-old girl's left forearm was amputated this morning after a car she 
was riding in crashed into the center divider and rolled on the Santa Ana 
Freeway in Capistrano Beach, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The girl, whose name was withheld because of her age, was with four other 
teen-agers, including an unlicensed 16-year-old boy who was driving, when the 
accident occurred about 12:25 a.m. north of Pacific Coast Highway, California 
Highway Patrolman Ken Daily said. 
</P>
<P>
Daily said the Dodge was traveling about 70 m.p.h. when the driver lost control 
of the car and crashed. After the accident, he and two other boys 16 fled, 
leaving the injured girl and another girl, also 14, in the wreck. The two 
girls, who may have been sitting in the back seat, were not wearing seat belts, 
Daily said. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics amputated the girl's arm at the scene. A spokeswoman at Mission 
Hospital Regional Medical Center said she was in serious but stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
About 4 a.m., the three boys arrived at San Clemente Hospital, where police 
arrested them. Daily said police would seek felony hit-and-run charges against 
the driver for leaving the scene of the accident. The others were released to 
their parents.

TOXIC SPILL CLOSES STREETS IN IRVINE

Two 55-gallon drums filled with an ether-based substance fell off a chemical 
truck in Irvine this morning, forcing authorities to close off the intersection 
at Von Karmen and McGaw avenues and evacuate two businesses, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Fire Department spokeswoman Kathleen Cha said passers-by 
discovered the drums, which were leaking into a flood control channel, about 
9:45 a.m. The drums fell off a truck from Cypress Chemical Co., based in 
Anaheim, Cha said. 
</P>
<P>
Two hazardous materials teams and a fire engine company were sent to the scene 
to identify the chemicals and stop the spill in the largely industrial and 
commercial area. 
</P>
<P>
Cha said that "because it is open air and because there are no winds," the 
situation appeared to be under control. The ether-based substance is moderately 
combustible and causes skin irritation, Cha said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials also advised area businesses to shut off air-conditioning units 
to prevent fumes from entering buildings. No injuries were reported.

A judge today blocked Saturday's white supremacist "Aryan Woodstock" rock 
concert, but refused to deny the skinheads the right to gather as planned on 
private land in the lush wine country of Napa County. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge W. Scott Snowden said the gathering, which organizers said 
could draw as many as 2,000 skinheads and racists, "demonstrated no clear and 
present danger to the public." 
</P>
<P>
County attorneys, in asking for a restraining order blocking the concert, had 
argued that the organizers failed to obtain the proper permit and would be a 
public nuisance. Organizer Tom Metzger, a former Ku Klux Klan leader, had 
argued that since the concert is on private property and by invitation only, no 
permit was needed.

BUSH REFUSES TO INTERVENE IN MACHINISTS' THREAT OF STRIKE AGAINST EASTERN 
AIRLINES

<P>
President Bush today refused to intervene in the threatened Eastern Airlines 
strike, rejecting a National Mediation Board recommendation and leaving the 
problem to company and machinists' union negotiators who face a midnight 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Bush refused to use his authority under provisions of the Railway Labor Act to 
appoint a presidential review panel to investigate the labor strife, a step 
that would have automatically delayed a strike for 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
"The President has decided not to accept this recommendation," White House 
Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"The National Mediation Board has for many months attempted unsuccessfully to 
bring the parties to an agreement," he said, "and the President has no reason 
to believe that an additional investigation or the 60-day delay that would be 
entailed would produce such an agreement." 
</P>
<P>
In light of the well-publicized threats of a strike and related activities, 
Fitzwater said, the Transportation Department "will monitor the situation and 
will, in addition, take whatever steps are needed to protect the safety of the 
traveling public." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Secondary Boycotts 
</P>
<P>
"The President urges responsible labor officials not to try to influence 
resolution of this dispute by disrupting the nation's transportation system 
through secondary boycotts against uninvolved parties," he said. "Such boycotts 
would unfairly burden millions of citizens, not only affecting necessary travel 
but also affecting shipments of consumer goods and the ability of workers to 
earn a living." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater noted that secondary boycotts are not permitted in other areas of the 
economy. He said that if the Eastern Airlines dispute threatens to disrupt 
essential transportation services, Bush will ask Congress to pass legislation 
"making it unlawful to use secondary picketing and boycotts against neutral 
carriers." 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot allow an isolated labor-management dispute to disrupt the nation's 
transportation system," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern, meanwhile, sent its machinists home this morning, citing "significant 
amounts of vandalism" and saying the action was intended to prevent sabotage in 
the hours before the strike deadline. A federal court order allowed the action. 
</P>
<P>
Federal mediators, who were meeting with the negotiators at an undisclosed 
Washington location, said an offer made Thursday by Eastern brought hope of a 
settlement in the 17-month-old dispute. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paid Holiday 
</P>
<P>
"They likely will meet pretty much all day," said National Mediation Board 
spokesman David Bushnell. "I expect it will go right up to the deadline if 
necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Eastern's chief operating officer in Miami, Joe Leonard, said machinists were 
given a paid holiday and told to return to work for shifts starting at 12:01 
a.m. Saturday.

ORANGE COUNTY BISHOP APPOINTS VICAR FOR AREA'S LATINO CATHOLICS

<TEXT>
<P>
Bishop Norman F. McFarland of Orange County today appointed Father Jaime Soto 
as the new vicar for the Latino Catholics in the diocese. 
</P>
<P>
The position is regarded as extremely important because the vicar represents 
400,000 people -- half the diocese -- many of whom remain undocumented, or 
under-represented in predominantly English-speaking parishes. Of 300 Masses 
celebrated every Sunday, 60 are in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Soto, 33, was ordained in 1982, was associate director of Catholic Charities 
and a priest at Our Lady of Guadalupe (Delhi), a predominantly Latino parish in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Soto succeeds Archbishop Tomas Clavel who died in October.

A Czechoslovak spy sent to Britain to ferret out U.S. "Star Wars" secrets and 
infiltrate Soviet emigre groups was jailed for 10 years today. 
</P>
<P>
The 44-year-old man told British security agents who caught him receiving coded 
radio messages at his London home that he was Dutch-born art dealer Erwin van 
Haarlem. After a five-day trial laced with tales of intrigue, conspiracy and 
false identity, Judge Simon-Brown told the slim, dark-haired man: "I address 
you by the name van Haarlem, although I am convinced it was not yours by birth. 
I have not the least doubt that you are a dedicated, disciplined and 
resourceful spy, and I have equally no doubt that had you not been caught you 
would in future years have done whatever your Czech controllers required you to 
do, however harmful that might have been to our national interest."

A couple in the midst of a divorce are fighting for custody of the fertilized 
eggs they put in frozen storage a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Lewis Davis, 30, says he does not want his wife, Mary Sue Davis, 28, to 
become pregnant, and a judge has issued an order temporarily blocking her from 
having the embryos implanted. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Davis' divorce petition and his objection to becoming a father, his 
wife has said she eventually plans to have the eggs implanted, according to the 
complaint. Davis contends that he and his wife jointly own the fertilized eggs 
and that any plans to use the frozen embryos to become pregnant -- as late as 
several years from now -- have an impact on his life.

Subway gunman Bernhard Goetz, two months into a one-year jail sentence on an 
illegal gun possession conviction, was denied early release today by the state 
Board of Parole. 
</P>
<P>
A short statement issued by the board said releasing Goetz early "would 
deprecate the seriousness of the crime and undermine respect for the law." The 
board's decision means Goetz will likely have to serve his full one-year 
sentence, minus any time off for good behavior. Goetz began serving his 
sentence Jan. 13. He was convicted on the gun charge in connection with the 
Dec. 22, 1984, shooting of four black youths on a New York City subway train. 
Goetz is white.

Finding a 75-cent accounting error in his computer system became an obsession 
for a Harvard astronomer. When he finally got to the bottom of it, he had found 
not only his missing quarters, but also an Eastern European electronic spy 
ring. 
</P>
<P>
For more than six months, finding the computer "hacker" who broke into his 
files consumed 38-year-old Clifford Stoll. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a West German official announced the arrests of three hackers who 
allegedly acquired sensitive military computer passwords and codes and sold 
them to the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
It all started with a 75-cent accounting error that Stoll noticed in the 
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory's shared-time computer system accounts in August, 
1986, when he was with the California facility. 
</P>
<P>
"If it had been $1,000 off, I wouldn't have thought anything of it," Stoll 
said. "It's like, if your house collapses, you just assume there's been an 
earthquake. But if you find a tiny termite hole, you think, 'Geez, I'd better 
investigate.' It's the little problems that are the most fascinating." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Nothing but Watch' 
</P>
<P>
Stoll searched for clues for three days and discovered that the error was 
caused by someone who had gained access to the computer through telephone 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
"For four months, I did absolutely nothing but watch what he typed in," said 
the bushy-haired Stoll. 
</P>
<P>
Stoll said it became apparent that the hacker was trying to use the Berkeley 
Laboratory's computer as a gateway to the so-called Milnet, a computer network 
linking defense plants, university labs and military installations. 
</P>
<P>
"He was searching for key words like nuclear, ICBM, SDI (Strategic Defense 
Initiative), biological warfare, NORAD (North American Air Defense). He was 
reading everything he could get his hands on, and then it turns out he was 
selling it to the Soviets," Stoll said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he told the FBI about the hacker in the late summer of 1986 but 
that there wasn't much of a response. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bogus Military Data 
</P>
<P>
Stoll said his girlfriend, tired of his electronic pager that would beep 
whenever the hacker got onto the system, was responsible for the big break in 
the case. She suggested that he lay a trap. 
</P>
<P>
He created bogus military data and a fictitious computer network called "SDI 
Net." The hacker took the bait, spending two hours reading through the 
material, giving Stoll enough time to trace the call to Hanover, West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Three months later, Stoll said, he got a letter from a man in Pittsburgh asking 
for information about SDI Net. When he turned that letter over to the FBI in 
April, 1987, he said, the bureau found that the man had connections to Eastern 
European governments and immediately began an investigation.

DOW CLOSES UP 8.40 WHILE MARKET POSTS SPOTTY GAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market posted some spotty gains today in a quiet session. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.40 to 2,274.11, stretching its 
gain for the week to 28.57 points. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 850 up, 578 down and 501 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 151.79 million shares, against 161.98 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index climbed .69 to 163.90. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department report that the index of leading economic indicators 
rose 0.6% in January was in line with advance estimates on the Street. 
</P>
<P>
The figures elicited no strong response from the bond market, where prices were 
mixed. 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of any stimulus from that direction, brokers said, money 
managers at investing institutions continued some selective buying of stocks in 
the hopes of showing good results when they make their first-quarter reports to 
clients at the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, however, traders seemed reluctant to make any big commitments. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices were mixed in early trading today as some shorter-term issues rose 
and longer-term issues slipped in response to the dollar's weakness in foreign 
exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was down 1/8 point, or about $1.25 per 
$1,000 face amount, at midday, and its yield, which moves in the opposite 
direction from its price, rose to 9.13% from 9.12% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices opened sharply lower in response to a decline overnight on the 
dollar's value in trading overseas, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
A declining dollar hurts bond prices by trimming the yields available to 
foreign investors, who are sizable holders of dollar-denominated debt. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott Platt, fixed-income research director for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; 
Jenrette, said government reports noting that the Index of Leading Economic 
Indicators rose 0.6% in January and that orders to factories for manufactured 
goods dropped 1.3% had little effect on bond prices. 
</P>
<P>
Prices recovered some lost ground later in the morning session after Venezuela 
said it was suspending payments on its $33-billion foreign debt. Platt said 
that helped prices of shorter-term Treasury issues, because that is where 
investors tend to put money in times of financial turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Secondary Market 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
were mixed with some off 1/32 point and others up 1/8 point, intermediate 
maturities were unchanged to 1/16 point higher and long-term issues were down 
1/4 point, according to the Telerate Inc. financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer, 
was unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
In corporate trading, industrials were up. Moody's investment grade corporate 
bond index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with 
maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.17 to 296.88. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.89% as the discount fell 6 basis 
points to 8.59%. Yields on six-month bills fell to 9.11% as the discount fell 4 
basis points to 8.61%. Yields on one-year bills dropped to 9.32% as the 
discount fell 2 basis points to 8.62%. 
</P>
<P>
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the 
annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the 
percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at 
maturity. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 9 13/16%, unchanged from late Thursday.

Factory orders fell 1.3% in January in the largest decline in five months as 
transportation orders, mainly for defense goods, were cut back, the Commerce 
Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding volatile defense orders, factory orders edged up 0.2% in January, the 
department said. The $3.1-billion decline in factory orders was the first since 
a 1.9% drop in September and was in line with most analysts' predictions. It 
brought the level of orders in January to $235.8 billion, adjusted for seasonal 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
For all of last year, factory orders gained 9.7% over the previous year, when 
they rose 7.1%. But volatility in the defense and transportation categories can 
cause wide fluctuations in factory orders from month to month.

Japan will not fund construction of the final segment of a controversial 
highway through the Amazon rain forests in Brazil, Sen. Robert W. Kasten Jr. 
(R-Wis.) said today. 
</P>
<P>
Kasten said he has received assurances from Japan's ambassador to the United 
States, Nobou Matsunaga, that Japan would not fund the highway, known as 
BR-364. Many environmentalists oppose the project because they fear it will 
harm the rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
"The ambassador assured me the Japanese are not considering any proposal to 
fund this highway," Kasten said in a statement. He said he believed pressure 
from the United States had helped persuade Japan not to fund the road. 
</P>
<P>
"I assured them that we will watch this project very closely because we intend 
to ensure that basic environmental safeguards are followed if an arrangement 
between the Brazilians and the Japanese develops," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This particular project has, over the past several years, failed almost every 
(environmental) safeguard conceivable," Kasten said. 
</P>
<P>
Kasten is senior Republican on the foreign operations subcommittee, which has 
jurisdiction over U.S. funds to multilateral development banks. He said Japan, 
as a leading source of development funds, had a responsibility to make sure 
projects are environmentally safe.

Lockheed Corp. stock surged today after Business Week reported rival aerospace 
giant Boeing Co. may try to buy the company. 
</P>
<P>
The "Inside Wall Street" stock-tipping column in March 13 editions of the 
business news weekly, published late Thursday and available on newsstands next 
week, quoted unidentified sources as saying Boeing is keenly interested in 
Lockheed's enormous defense contracting business. 
</P>
<P>
In early New York Stock Exchange trading, Lockheed rose $1.50 a share to $49.25 
in active trading. 
</P>
<P>
The column quoted an unidentified money manager as saying Boeing can easily 
afford to buy Lockheed because it has $4.2 billion in cash with little debt. 
The column also said Boeing's own military sales aren't expected to grow this 
year, whereas Lockheed's have grown 30% annually since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Both companies declined to comment on takeover speculation.

The Columbus 500 sports car race scheduled for Oct. 1 was canceled today by 
International Motor Sports Assn. officials after promoters were unable to save 
the financially troubled event. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, all of the people behind the scenes came close, but could not 
manage to put all of the pieces together to have a race this year," IMSA 
Executive Vice President Mark Raffauf said. The race was to be run on a 
2.3-mile course in the streets of downtown Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
IMSA officials are reviewing options to fill the open date. 
</P>
<P>
The Columbus street race began in 1985. However, the race was reportedly deeply 
in debt, and the Columbus City Council Thursday voted down a request by the 
promoters for a $350,000 debt reduction bond 7 to 0.

After being hospitalized following a one-car accident near Reston, Va.,

Vaughn was flown by helicopter to Fairfax Hospital after being freed from his 
car, which had struck a tree early this morning, said police spokeswoman Judy 
Duff. The 24-year-old defensive back didn't suffer any serious or

<P>
Nasr El Arab, the high weight and early favorite, drew post position 7 today as 
11 thoroughbreds were entered for Sunday's $1-million Santa Anita Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Charlie Whittingham, who also has Payant and Frankly Perfect among the 
competitors for the $550,000 winner's purse, said the post positions should 
make little difference in a 1 1/4-mile race. Nasr El Arab, with early odds of 
5-2, must carry high weight of 124, conceding from two to 12 pounds to his 
rivals. 
</P>
<P>
In post position order the entries were Stylish Winner, Payant, Good Taste, 
Super Diamond, Perceive Arrogance, Stalwars, Nasr El Arab, Martial Law, Frankly 
Perfect, Triteamtri and Cherokee Colony.
