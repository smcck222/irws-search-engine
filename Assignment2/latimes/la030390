JETS GET TARGET PRACTICE ON YOUNG KING GOALIE; 
</P>
<P>
HOCKEY: STAUBER MAKES FIRST START, THEN SURRENDERS THREE QUICK GOALS BEFORE 
BEING REPLACED IN 9-3 LOSS AT WINNIPEG.

WINNIPEG, Canada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Kings wanted to look at highly touted rookie goaltender Robb Stauber, so 
they tossed him on the ice at Winnipeg Arena Friday after giving him a glove, a 
stick, pads and a mask -- but nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
No support. 
</P>
<P>
No defense. 
</P>
<P>
No chance. 
</P>
<P>
The results were predictable. The Winnipeg Jets jumped on the 22-year-old for 
three goals in a little over three minutes and went on to a 9-3 victory before 
a sellout crowd of 15,582. 
</P>
<P>
When the barrage was over, the Kings' Wayne Gretzky could only shake his head. 
</P>
<P>
"Ken Dryden couldn't have played well tonight," Gretzky said, referring to the 
great former Montreal Canadien goalie. 
</P>
<P>
Said Rogie Vachon, King general manager: "We made some stupid mistakes. We had 
to give him a chance to get his feet wet. He needed some time. Instead, we 
played like . . . in front of him. I feel sorry for him." 
</P>
<P>
Stauber blocked the first shot that sailed his way. Then came the barrage: 
</P>
<P>
 -- At 2:02 of the first period, Thomas Steen scored his 14th goal, putting it 
beneath Stauber's pads from the edge of the left circle. The goal was set up 
when the puck was knocked away from Petr Prajsler. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At 2:42, Dave Mcllwain scored his 21st goal, backhanding the puck in after 
a turnover. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At 3:07, Phil Sykes scored his first of two, from the left edge of the 
crease after a turnover by Larry Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings then yanked Stauber. True, the damage had been done, but why compound 
it by risking psychological damage to the youngster? 
</P>
<P>
They brought him back for the third period, figuring the game was lost. 
</P>
<P>
Stauber seemed calm in the locker room afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a lot of fun out there," Stauber said. "It never is when things go 
like that." 
</P>
<P>
A veteran of one NHL game, the former University of Minnesota player and a 
sixth-round draft choice of the Kings wasn't about to criticize his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been through these nights before," he said, "when the puck has an eye for 
the net. It was a combination of things. I wasn't sharp." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about his lack of support, Stauber said: "That's the goalie's job. He has 
to come up with some big saves. Sometimes, the team can pick up on that. I just 
wasn't capable of that tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Stauber made a couple of appearances with the Kings in the exhibition season, 
then sat out most of the season because of back and groin injuries. 
</P>
<P>
He started his comeback with the Kings' New Haven Nighthawk farm club, 
compiling a 3-2-1 record and a 1.98 goals-against average. He was selected 
American Hockey League player of the week shortly before being recalled. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings, with a question mark hovering over their net as the regular season 
winds down, are hoping Stauber can provide some answers. 
</P>
<P>
Starter Kelly Hrudey is in Los Angeles, still trying to recover from a viral 
infection that might linger for several more weeks. Backup Mario Gosselin has 
been ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
Only 29-year-old Ron Scott, called up from New Haven almost a month ago, has 
shown consistency in goal. 
</P>
<P>
Stauber finished with six goals surrendered on 13 shots, but Vachon indicated 
Stauber might get another look in the finale of this two-game series Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
That figures to be a big game now since the Kings, in dropping to 28-31-6, find 
themselves eight points behind the third-place Jets (31-27-8) in the Smythe 
Division with only 15 games to play. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings seemed to be feeling the effects of Wednesday night's game with the 
Edmonton Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
That game, the most penalty-filled in NHL history, left the Kings without the 
services of right wing Tomas Sandstrom, out with an injury; and defenseman 
Marty McSorley, serving a three-game suspension. 
</P>
<P>
Add to that a 9 1/2-hour trip here because of plane trouble Thursday and you 
have a club that figured to be less than sharp. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the game was over, both Sykes, with his seventh and eighth goals, 
and Doug Evans, with his fourth and fifth, had scored twice. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the Jets took 34 shots on goal, often against a defense that was 
nowhere to found. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
King right wing Tomas Sandstrom underwent laser surgery on his injured right 
eye Friday. Sandstrom, struck in one of Wednesday night's numerous battles with 
the Edmonton Oilers, has a facial fracture, a scratched right cornea and some 
bleeding around the eye. He hopes to be back in the lineup in a week. 
</P>
<P>
King General Manager Rogie Vachon says he might yet make a deal before 
Tuesday's trading deadline. "I'm not anxious just to go out and make a deal," 
Vachon said, "but if we could get a good, defensive defenseman, I'd have to 
think about it." Who could the Kings offer? Asked about Luc Robitaille, the 
team leader in goals scored, Vachon was adamant. "He's not going anywhere," 
Vachon said . . . Vachon also seemed to rule out dealing one of his four 
goalies. "I don't think," he said, "we can afford to with our present 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings' Jay Miller, scratched from the lineup Wednesday, was assessed his 
third game misconduct of the season, resulting in a one-game suspension.

MORNING BRIEFING: HE THOUGHT IT WAS A TERRIFIC OPPORTUNITY TO STOP THE MEDIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARLEY TINKHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The subject was the Super Bowl, and George Young, general manager of the New 
York Giants, recalled a party that agent Leigh Steinberg held for the media 
before the game. 
</P>
<P>
Young: "When I heard he was taking all those writers out on a river boat in New 
Orleans, I spent about an hour trying to see if I could rent a submarine." 
</P>
<P>
Wizard speaks: From John Wooden, defending Pacific 10 basketball: "Whenever 
people talk negatively about the Pac-10, I ask, 'How many schools in the Pac-10 
have won an NCAA championship?' The answer is four -- UCLA, Cal, Stanford and 
Oregon. 'And how many in the Atlantic Coast Conference?' Two -- North Carolina 
and North Carolina State." 
</P>
<P>
Even the Western Athletic Conference is ahead of the ACC with three -- Wyoming, 
Utah and Texas El Paso (Texas Western). The leader, on the strength of 
Michigan's victory last season, is the Big Ten with five. The Wolverines joined 
Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio State and Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Name the only man who has been the head coach of teams in both the 
Rose Bowl and the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Tough life: The Sporting News reports that Pete Rose, in a speech at the 
University of Florida, for which he was paid $11,000, said, "I made some 
mistakes, and I paid the price." 
</P>
<P>
Said the Sporting News: "The price he is paying? He is living in his newly 
built, $1-million home in Plant City, Fla., where he hits golf balls in the 
morning, plays 18 holes in the afternoon and takes his family to dinner at 
night." 
</P>
<P>
Artist at work: Chi Chi Rodriguez, on Lee Trevino, who is carving up the 
opposition on the Senior PGA Tour: "This guy can do drawings with a golf ball. 
He looks like Pablo Picasso out there." 
</P>
<P>
Woman's touch: The best putter in golf? Curtis Strange votes for Nancy Lopez. 
"From eight feet in, she is the best, man, woman or child," says Strange. 
</P>
<P>
Just asking: Would NBC still be happy with its Notre Dame package if Lou Holtz 
pulled up stakes? 
</P>
<P>
Holtz has completed four years at South Bend. In five previous head coaching 
jobs, his average stay was three years. In six assistant coaching jobs, his 
average stay was two years. 
</P>
<P>
Holtz's wife said, "Whenever we go to a new town the first thing I do is check 
out the resale value of houses." 
</P>
<P>
The Judge speaks: Former Raider cornerback Lester Hayes, on former Seattle 
Seahawks receiver Steve Largent, whom he called, "the Caucasian Clydesdale": "I 
tried to intimidate Steve, and Steve only smiled. I put bull's-eyes all over 
Steve's anatomy and I missed him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all because he has a halo around him. He's God's gift. He looks like a 
silver surfer from Venice Beach." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Dick Vermeil (UCLA, 1976; Philadelphia, 1981). 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: NBC's Al McGuire, on sometimes broadcasting partner Joel Meyers: 
"One of the best voices since Nelson Eddy." HARLEY TINKHAM

SOCCER IS A GREAT GAME, BUT NO ONE KNOWS IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many times in the last few years, and once again in Melvin Durslag's column on 
Saturday, Feb. 24, the Times has published articles that raise the same 
question about soccer in the United States. At least Durslag's point of view 
was relatively positive, and didn't make any statements that were patently 
wrong to anyone who knows anything about soccer. 
</P>
<P>
When I was in high school here in Los Angeles 30 years ago, soccer was unknown. 
Twelve years ago, through my kids playing AYSO, I started to learn about the 
game. Now I coach and referee AYSO, and referee L.A. City and CIF high school 
games, and play in an over-30 league. 
</P>
<P>
Soccer is an incredible game from every angle except maybe a TV advertiser's 
point of view. But without that TV exposure and the proper promotion, it's just 
going to take that much longer. It's a pity that the opportunity afforded the 
United States to promote soccer through hosting the 1994 World Cup is being 
squandered.

<TEXT>

The NHL season is almost over and people are starting to wonder about 
postseason awards. 
</P>
<P>
According to the latest stats, there is a tie for the coveted Lord Robitussin 
trophy, between Wayne Gretzky and Larry Robinson of the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
The Lord Robitussin, of course, is awarded to the player who coughs up the puck 
the most times during the season. 
</P>
<P>
Good luck to both of you. Either one of you truly deserve it.

REMEMBER TIM RICHMOND AS A GREAT RACE DRIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Elliott Almond's article, "Family Says Drug Test Falsified," has shed new light 
on the demise of one of NASCAR's bright stars. 
</P>
<P>
Those of us who saw Tim Richmond race know that he had attained the driver's 
goal of being a part of the car. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, we will read of many more sports figures who will be maligned by 
bogus drug-testing procedures and those that will perish from AIDS.

<P>
As long as the NFL is going to revise its schedule to 17 weeks, they should 
take the opportunity to make it more fair and competitive: 
</P>
<P>
(1) All teams should play weeks 1-5 and 13-17, with all byes to occur in weeks 
6-12 (four teams a week for seven weeks). 
</P>
<P>
(2) Weeks 14-17 should be reserved for intradivision play. 
</P>
<P>
(3) No "Monday Night Football" in the last week of the season. All teams should 
get the same amount of rest before the playoffs.

NORTH HOLLYWOOD SURPRISES FAVORED FREMONT, 76-71

<P>
North Hollywood, behind a strong performance by center Dana Jones, pulled off 
an upset Friday night at the Sports Arena, winning the City 3-A title by 
beating Fremont, 76-71. 
</P>
<P>
It marks the first basketball championship in the history of the school and 
propelled the Huskies into next week's Southern State Regionals. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, a 6-foot-6 senior bound for Pepperdine, dominated the game at both ends 
of the floor. He scored 29 points, had 29 rebounds, blocked seven shots and had 
two assists. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted it real bad," said Jones, who had been told by Coach Steve 
Miller that he would have to play "the game of his (Jones') life" for the 
Huskies (24-3) to win. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'I'll do it,' " Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
For Fremont (29-3), the state's fifth-ranked team in Division I, the loss 
before 5,240 may have cut short a season that some had speculated would end 
with a state title. 
</P>
<P>
"He did an outstanding job," Fremont Coach Sam Sullivan said of Jones. "He was 
the key defensively. He shut us down all night and kept us from penetrating. 
That was the key, since we depend on penetrating offensively." 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood scored 15 consecutive points in four minutes to turn a 16-11 
first-quarter deficit into a 26-16 lead. The run was highlighted by the play of 
Jones, who had seven blocks and 11 rebounds in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Fremont, stunned by the Huskies' quick start, answered with a 12-2 run at the 
end of the half to tie the score, 30-30. 
</P>
<P>
"We came in here, everybody was saying how this was the best 3-A team ever and 
we played them even," an ecstatic Miller said. "It's a storybook ending. A 
perfect scenario. Case closed." 
</P>
<P>
Leading 41-40 with 4:40 to play in the third quarter, the Huskies went on a 
15-3 run to build a 56-43 lead heading into the fourth quarter.

CAPERS IS DIFFERENCE AS MANUAL ARTS BEATS CRENSHAW 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two years ago, Manual Arts senior guard Marcell Capers was not good enough to 
make Crenshaw High's varsity basketball team. But Friday night, he helped end 
the Cougars' two-year City championship reign. 
</P>
<P>
Behind Capers' 26 points, the Toilers won their first City 4-A Division title 
since 1981 as they defeated Crenshaw, 84-72, before 8,177 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Six-foot-6 senior center William Celestine scored 25 points and grabbed 12 
rebounds to lead the Toilers. He scored 20 of his points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"We expected them to play us hard, Capers said. "So we came out and went right 
at them knowing that they would not back down.." 
</P>
<P>
The first half was a defensive battle as both teams effectively took away the 
other's strengths. 
</P>
<P>
Manual Arts' concern was to stop Crenshaw's guards from penetrating and the 
Cougars' goal was to prevent the Toilers from making easy baskets inside. 
</P>
<P>
Manual Arts was more successful with its game plan as the Toilers shut down the 
Cougars' high-scoring duo of Alex Scruggs, who made three of 18 shots, and 
Kevin Ollie, who made eight of 22. 
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter, Manual Arts was able to make an 8-0 run and take a 16-8 
lead. Junior guard Dwain Bradberry scored eight points in the quarter for 
Manual Arts. 
</P>
<P>
However, Capers, scored 13 first half points as the Toilers took a 35-31 
halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Celestine dominated as the Toilers pulled away from the 
defending state champions. 
</P>
<P>
Manual Arts (25-3) gets an automatic berth in the State Regional Tournament, 
which begins Tuesday. Crenshaw (22-5) can only hope for an at-large bid.

TOM PETTY PRESENTS AN ARTISTRY ALL HIS OWN; 
</P>
<P>
ROCK SUMMIT: THOUGH HE WAS JOINED BY SPRINGSTEEN AND DYLAN AT THE FORUM, THE 
VETERAN ROCKER WASN'T OVERMATCHED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Petty has arrived at that summit of stardom where, when joined in encore 
Thursday at the Forum by what in rock terms amounts to a visitation from the 
gods -- Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen -- he didn't seem outranked. This, as 
far as the crowd was concerned, was a meeting of equals. 
</P>
<P>
It's the characteristics he shares with both those now-contemporaries which 
make him, in turn, a unique figure. Petty is like Springsteen in his eagerness 
to please a crowd, sociably playing almost all the favorites with a very tight, 
vigorous band -- the Heartbreakers, of course -- and coddling them with 
compliments and sing-alongs. 
</P>
<P>
But he's much more hidden a personality than Springsteen, which puts him more 
in Dylan's camp. If his songs often suggest vulnerability, weariness or a sad, 
haunted quality, there is little hint of that in the bemused public persona. 
He's about as guarded as you can get while still being a multi-platinum Pop 
Populist. 
</P>
<P>
Petty's cool, heavy-lidded countenance is all his own, and if you don't ever 
feel you get to know what he's like over the course of a concert, you do know 
you're seeing someone who's emerged as an original through all his influences. 
And you do get your money's worth. Thursday's show included the bulk of the 
greatest hits of Petty and the Heartbreakers, as well as the bulk of his 
latest, biggest-selling and perhaps best album, "Full Moon Fever," a record 
that brings up all the sad and ambiguous feelings that he apparently feels no 
need to expound upon in the happy-go-lucky concert atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
The show hasn't changed a great deal since the tour came through last summer, 
but for one important factor: Petty and company concentrate far more on the 
latest album this time through. Not that it could have been a very hard a 
decision to make; sales and airplay of "Fever" have taken off into the 
stratosphere since then, not to mention the two Grammy nominations. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, all eight selections were wise choices, from "Free Fal" -- with 
its post-breakup evocation of simultaneous relief and panic, one of the great 
singles of recent times -- to the equally ambiguous but more long-faced "Face 
in the Crowd." 
</P>
<P>
Amid the predictability of the crowd sing on "Break Down" or the now-standard 
acoustic opening of "The Waiting," there were also nice surprises -- like 
drummer Stan Lynch's lead vocal on Chuck Berry's "Down the Road a Piece," a 
well-chosen rendition of Thunderclap Newman's "Something in the Air," guitar 
ace Mike Campbell's wild hammered dulcimer introduction to "Don't Come Around 
Here No More," or that same song's strobe-lit jaunt by the normally stationary 
suit of armor at stage left. 
</P>
<P>
As for those stellar visitations? Excitement-generating, sure, but in actuality 
not up to the level of the preceding set. Recalling the spontaneous days of the 
Dylan/Petty tour a few years back, Dylan came out to sing "Rainy Day Women," 
then followed with another rocker that the ever-ready Heartbreakers seemed not 
to know but played along with anyhow, provoking some laughs both on and off 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
Springsteen, looking rather Bono-esque with slicked-back hair, ponytail, 
stinger beard and earring, then emerged to sing his perennial cover of 
Creedence Clearwater Revival's "Travelin' Band," followed by a loose duet with 
Petty on the Animals' "I'm Cryin'." There was no attempt at a Traveling 
Wilburys-style group sing, despite the presence backstage of Jeff Lynne. 
</P>
<P>
As for the question of what ever happened to Petty's "Southern Accents"-era 
sideburns, the answer was made clear: He donated them to this tour's opening 
act, flower-child revivalist Lenny Kravitz. 
</P>
<P>
The wildly talented up-and-comer opened with a well-received set whose earnest, 
energetic hippie-dippyness skirted being both silly and electrifying -- but 
leaning more often, happily, toward the latter. He tends more toward 
psychedelic rock than R&amp;B, but his soul ballad, "Precious Love," was 
knockout enough to send Prince and D'Arby running for cover. 
</P>
<P>
Petty and Kravitz are set to do it again tonight at the Pacific Amphitheatre.

FACES . . . : A QUICK-CHANGE ARTIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The next time you're stuck on the Ventura Freeway during rush hour and the 
driver behind you with a 5 o'clock shadow looks a little impatient, be 
understanding. It could be actor Mike Michaud, trying to get to work. 
</P>
<P>
Since late January, Michaud has managed to beat the Thursday through Saturday 
traffic as he rushes from his day job at the Universal Studios Tour to arrive 
at the Colony Studio Theatre for the curtain of John Banach's play, "Naked 
Dancing." 
</P>
<P>
The challenge isn't simply being a speedy commuter. Michaud has to pull off a 
mind-bending role reversal: at Universal, he plays Kohbad-Shah, the evil 
double-swordsman in "Conan the Barbarian"; in "Naked Dancing," he plays Frank, 
an outwardly chummy but emotionally damaged man who befriends a woman gripped 
by fear of the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
"It's actually more difficult doing the play when I don't do 'Conan' 
beforehand," the Chicago-born actor says. "They're so different that they feed 
each other. When it's not summer, we do three or four 'Conan' shows a day. My 
character comes back from the dead and emerges out of laser light to battle 
Conan. It gets my adrenaline going. Since I barely make the play in time, I'm 
really buzzing." 
</P>
<P>
Michaud, who reckons that he has been in one play or another for three 
consecutive years (including the Colony's "Guys and Dolls" revival and Rafael 
Lima's "El Salvador"), has none of Frank's innocence. Not after his years in 
Chicago. "I grew up in the projects, worked for the phone company after 
Catholic high school, and then did some male stripping. A pal took me to see 
the Steppenwolf theater company, and I saw what real acting was." 
</P>
<P>
Michaud knew his future was either in New York or Los Angeles, "so I flipped a 
coin. Heads was L.A., tails was New York. 
</P>
<P>
"Boy, am I glad it landed heads." ROBERT KOEHLER

FACES . . . : FACE BEHIND A MERMAID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"On Monday, I feel like I've been hit by a truck," says Jodi Benson, who's 
putting in an eight-performance week playing a feisty fashion 
illustrator-turned-Communist organizer in Kander and Ebb's period musical 
"Flora, the Red Menace" at the Pasadena Playhouse. "I'm on stage the whole 
time, running around, using up energy. So on Monday, I sleep in and try not to 
talk to anybody." 
</P>
<P>
That's not easy for someone who's gotten famous for her voice -- playing the 
title role in last year's popular animated film, "The Little Mermaid." Recalls 
the Illinois native, "I thought I would just go in and sing on it; no big deal. 
It wasn't till I started talking at schools and mental facilities that I 
realized the impact this film was having on people. All those 10-year-olds 
think I'm her! That's a big responsibility to live up to." 
</P>
<P>
It's also a possible career pigeonhole. 
</P>
<P>
"I started out as an actress, then found I could make money as a singer -- so I 
moved to New York," says Benson (whose Broadway credits include "Smile," 
"Marilyn: An American Fable" and "Welcome to the Club"). "Because of 'Mermaid,' 
people see me as a vocalist. So we're working on that. I've been auditioning 
for not-singing stuff, mostly pilots. It's a good time to be out here, 
introduce the face behind the voice." 
</P>
<P>
Although she's toured all over the country -- plus a trek to Italy in "West 
Side Story" -- Benson is happy to settle down in Los Angeles ("I always wanted 
to live here, but I wanted to come out with a job"), and will be even happier 
when her actor-husband Ray arrives from New York. As for career, "Let's face 
it," she says with a sigh. "To my family in Illinois, Broadway doesn't mean 
anything. To them, I won't have made it till my face is on TV." JANICE ARKATOV

THE ACADEMY DOCUMENTARY JUDGES' VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Film Makers Urge Academy to Change Selection System," Elaine Dutka's Feb. 23 
article on the motion-picture academy's selection of documentary nominations, 
is misleading to the extent of being grossly unfair. 
</P>
<P>
Television and press critic Roger Ebert is quoted as saying, "What you have 
here is a volunteer committee of good-hearted but fairly out-of-touch senior 
citizens acting as a roadblock against the advancement of those films which 
don't conform to its old-fashioned standards." Ebert's deduction is based on 
the notion that, as the article says, the committee "screened 59 films (and 
took) six hours a week over a two-month period . . . so few people with busy 
schedules are drawn to the task in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
What nonsense. The screenings were held evenings, two nights a week, with an 
occasional need for a Saturday session. What does this have to do with busy 
schedules? 
</P>
<P>
"Out-of-touch senior citizens" are buzzwords designed to discredit a group of 
hard-working, selfless individuals who have a keen interest in the documentary 
form. 
</P>
<P>
The article refers to "The Thin Blue Line" as excluded from the list of Oscar 
contenders. And Dutka writes that a letter to the academy from 44 film makers 
expresses " 'shock and outrage' over the omission (italics mine) of 'Roger 
&amp; Me.' " Again, nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing is excluded or omitted. First of all, we as committee members do not 
exclude, omit or nominate films. We judge them. We judge films based on merit 
and we vote our opinions. We do not know what the nominees will be when we have 
completed our judgments. 
</P>
<P>
"Roger &amp; Me" is, to quote the film makers' letter, "this year's most 
visible, biting documentary." It is true that it is the year's most visible 
documentary. It is probably this century's most visible and certainly the most 
lucrative documentary, if not the most famous. Is it the best? That is a very 
subjective question. It was, however, not excluded or omitted. It was judged by 
a group of fair-minded individuals and its relative merits in the voting found 
that it was not a nominee.

BRITS IN AMERICA

<TEXT>
<P>
Before I read Arkatov's interview, I was planning to see Margolyes' one-woman 
show. Now I'm not, and I'm grateful that Margolyes herself warned me off. 
</P>
<P>
I'm one of those rare (according to her) Americans with an attention span 
longer than 20 minutes, one of those nearly nonexistent Americans who knows who 
Charles Dickens is. 
</P>
<P>
During my 20 years in New York City, I got to see plenty of bad, much-praised 
British theater, dumbed-down and condescendingly performing, the actors 
flirting with the supposed transoceanic yokels in the audience instead of 
serving the text and playing to each other. 
</P>
<P>
I hope someone made a tape of "Wooman" in England; I'll wait for the real thing 
on PBS or Bravo or A&amp;E.

CASSAVETES SURVEY OPENS WITH 'SHADOWS,' HIS FIRST FEATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Films of John Cassavetes," which the UCLA Film Archive presents today 
through March 18, will provide the all-too-rare opportunity to see all 11 
features that Cassavetes made over a 25-year-period. Cassavetes, who died a 
year ago at 59, was the quintessential independent film maker, determined to 
get at the truth of human experience at all costs. His films were rough around 
the edges, but he got a raw honesty up there on the screen in an era when few 
others did. 
</P>
<P>
It would be hard for young people today to imagine what it was like seeing 
Cassavetes' first feature "Shadows" (1958-59), which launches the retrospective 
tonight at 7:30 in Melnitz Theater, when it was brand-new. Those of us raised 
on Hollywood make-believe but captivated by foreign films in our college years 
were not prepared for the impact of the honesty and unvarnished realism of 
"Shadows" in an American film. 
</P>
<P>
It is a bittersweet story of black youths of varying hues of skin color that 
evoked the tempo and quality of life for young people in New York at the time. 
It requires no effort to summon the memory of the pain and anguish of this film 
nor its gritty evocation of Manhattan streets, harshly lit restaurants and 
nondescript apartments. Playing with "Shadows" is the first and better of 
Cassavetes' two uneven studio productions, "Too Late Blues" (1961), in which 
Bobby Darin plays a jazz musician tempted to sell out in order to survive. 
</P>
<P>
Just as successfully as he captured the cool life style of young people adrift 
in the neon and steel jungle of New York in "Shadows," Cassavetes zeroes in on 
the bored existence of the affluent middle-aged in Los Angeles suburbia in the 
equally remarkable "Faces" (1968), which screens Sunday at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
He focuses on one couple (John Marley and Lynn Carlin), whom he follows through 
a harrowing 48 hours, climaxing in a veritable Walpurgisnacht in which their 
14-year marriage comes apart at the seams. The pivotal character, played by 
Cassavetes' wife and frequent star, Gena Rowlands, is a high-class prostitute 
of extraordinary beauty and sensitivity. Other unforgettables in the cast are 
Seymour Cassel as a goofy yet compassionate peroxided hustler and Dorothy 
Gulliver as a dumpy, frowzy housewife nakedly direct in her craving for 
affection. 
</P>
<P>
Playing with it is "A Child Is Waiting" (1963), an unhappy but not wholly 
ineffective collaboration between Cassavetes and producer Stanley Kramer and 
starring Burt Lancaster and Judy Garland, who clash over the treatment of the 
retarded children in their care. For full schedule: (213) 206-FILM, 206-8013.

'H.E.L.P.': THERE'S LIFE IN THE RESCUE GENRE YET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At first sight, ABC's new "H.E.L.P." appears to be nothing more than 
prime-time's umpteenth rescue series -- yet more adventures of an emergency 
unit of the police or fire department that bravely faces danger to save lives. 
</P>
<P>
Originating with "Rescue 8" in the late 1950s, the formula has yielded 
"Emergency," "240 Robert" and others series in a line leading directly to the 
present CBS program "Rescue 911," which enlivens the genre dramatically by 
building episodes around footage from actual cases. 
</P>
<P>
Premiering at 8 tonight on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42, "H.E.L.P." (Harlem 
Eastside Lifesaving Program) is indeed another chip off an old and durable 
block, one offering the usual assortment of life-threatening emergencies and 
humorous predicaments encountered by an eclectic unit of firefighters, police 
and paramedics under the command of Battalion Chief Patrick Meacham (John 
Mahoney). 
</P>
<P>
What elevates the opener for "H.E.L.P." above the crowd, however, is 
atmospheric shooting in New York, good direction by co-executive producer 
Christopher Crowe, an interesting plot (again from Crowe) and a fine, sensitive 
performance by Mahoney in what is essentially a stock role. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight finds Meacham on the verge of being promoted to a bigger, higher-paying 
job "downtown," only to learn that his own future may be decided by the outcome 
of an arson investigation that could turn out to be embarrassing for the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Although too much of "H.E.L.P." is trite and telescoped, tonight's blazing 
conclusion is deeply affecting despite its predictability. Much more compelling 
than the story's fire-fighting aspects, however, are the sooty politics and 
inter-department squabbles that at least temporarily take this series to 
another level. HOWARD ROSENBERG

<P>
On what was supposed to be 1990's first weekend of televised Major League 
Baseball, the owners' lockout and subsequent exhibition-game cancellation has 
transformed two big races Sunday into the weekend's top televised sporting 
events. 
</P>
<P>
At 8 a.m. Sunday, Channel 13 launches its five-hour telecast of the fifth Los 
Angeles Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
The marathon is Southern California's largest sporting event, with a field of 
nearly 20,000 expected for the 26-mile, 385-yard race. 
</P>
<P>
At 4:30 p.m., SportsChannel will broadcast the $1-million Santa Anita Handicap, 
the Western Hemisphere's richest handicap race. Morning-line favorite Bayakoa 
is seeking to become the first female winner in the race's 53-year history. 
</P>
<P>
College basketball fans can get a gauge on how seven of the top 10 teams are 
playing less than two weeks before the start of the NCAA Tournament. 
Third-ranked Missouri meets Notre Dame at 11:30 a.m. today on Channels 4, 36 
and 39, while No. 2 Nevada-Las Vegas visits Cal State Fullerton for a 7:30 p.m. 
Prime Ticket broadcast. 
</P>
<P>

SHAKING YOUR FAMILY TREE: AN ANCESTOR'S MIGRATION CAN BE TRACED AT A SHIP'S 
DEPARTURE PORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Finding the name of the ship that brought your immigrant ancestors to America 
is probably your No. 1 research priority. 
</P>
<P>
There is good news and bad news for genealogists: The good news is every ship 
had its passenger list or cargo manifest, so there is a record of every 
immigrant who came, and when, and on what ship. But the bad news is not all the 
records have survived. 
</P>
<P>
"Most Americans can discover what ship brought their ancestors to this 
continent," writes John Philip Colletta in his new book, "They Came in Ships" 
(available from Ancestry Inc., P.O. Box 308, Salt Lake City, Utah 84110; $8.45 
postpaid). 
</P>
<P>
"The facts of your immigrant ancestor's life and voyage take on fuller meaning 
when viewed within the context of the family," Colletta says. For example, was 
your ancestor the first or the last of the family to come to America? Did he or 
she come alone or with siblings and parents? Did he return to the old country? 
You may be surprised to discover that your ancestor made several voyages back 
and forth. 
</P>
<P>
"Your family's migration story represents just a sampling of the numerous ways 
in which ship list information can be used to expand your research activities 
and your knowledge of your family's history," Colletta says. And in his handy 
little book, he guides you through the maze of extant ship passenger records 
and shows how to find your ancestors in them. 
</P>
<P>
To find your immigrant ancestor you need to know: Name -- full real name, age 
at arrival and date of arrival. 
</P>
<P>
Passenger lists were normally prepared in the port of departure, so the names 
you are looking for will appear as they were in that place and time. So you 
need your ancestor's full, formal, legal name of birth in the old country. Many 
American families go by a surname that was changed -- somewhat (as in spelling) 
or greatly (a totally different name). 
</P>
<P>
Many European women -- particularly French and Italian -- may be recorded on 
ship lists under their maiden names. This does not mean they were unmarried, as 
some researchers have erroneously concluded. So look for your female ancestors 
under both married and maiden names. 
</P>
<P>
The approximate age of your immigrant ancestor is important to help you 
distinguish him or her, because while you may think you are researching a rare 
surname, you may discover it is quite common in a particular ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
Colletta cautions that you must know the approximate date of your ancestor's 
arrival at a U.S. port in order to know where to begin your search. "If you can 
learn only a year, or the season and the year, or month and year, you can begin 
your search," he says. 
</P>
<P>
For researchers there are two distinct periods of ship passenger lists: 
1565-1819 and 1820-1954. In the earlier group, if the passenger list still 
exists, it may be in some archive, museum, courthouse, basement or attic. Lists 
of this early period are not preserved in the National Archives in Washington, 
D.C. However, many of these records have been published, so you will need to 
search in libraries for indexes to published lists. 
</P>
<P>
If your ancestors arrived between 1820 and 1954, a microfilm copy of the 
passenger list is probably at the National Archives -- some, but not all, of 
which have been indexed. The Family History Library in Salt Lake City and 
American Genealogical Lending Library (P.O Box 244, Bountiful, Utah 84010) also 
have microfilm copies of these ship passenger lists. 
</P>
<P>
"They Came in Ships" is a commendable, though not comprehensive, highly 
readable, guide to locating the name of the ship that brought your ancestors to 
America.

DAY HIKE: FITNESS ON ROAD TO BLISS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ascent of Mt. Bliss constitutes what hikers call a "conditioning hike," 
that is, a real aerobic workout. The incline is steep, the cardiovascular 
system gets revved up, and the clear-day views from the summit of this San 
Gabriel Mountains peak are truly rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
The route to Bliss utilizes both Van Tassel Fire Road and Van Tassel Trail. The 
fire road -- and others in the front range of the San Gabriels -- came into 
existence after the monstrous fire of September, 1924, the worst fire in the 
history of the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The fire began in San Gabriel Canyon and rapidly spread westward. Despite the 
efforts of firefighters, the blaze burned for three weeks and for a time 
threatened Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
As Rush Charleton, superintendent of Angeles National Forest at the time, put 
it: "The greatest difficulty in fighting the fire was the lack of roads over 
which to transport supplies to the men." 
</P>
<P>
Determined to prevent the occurrence of another fire of this size, the Forest 
Service began an ambitious program to build roads and firebreaks throughout the 
San Gabriels. One of these roads was the Van Tassel Fire Road. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Van Tassel Fire Road is patrolled by both the Los Angeles County 
Fire Department and Angeles National Forest personnel. Only official vehicles 
are allowed, but hikers and mountain bicyclists are welcome to travel the road. 
</P>
<P>
The new Van Tassel Trail, a footpath that leads from Valley View Park on the 
outskirts of the town of Duarte to an intersection with Van Tassel Road, also 
came into existence thanks to the efforts of firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Ross Marshall of the Los Angeles County Fire Department supervised a 
hard-working crew from the California Division of Corrections. Crew members cut 
brush and dug a trail -- skills they employ when they fight fires. These 
efforts earned the men time off from their sentences. 
</P>
<P>
Van Tassel Trail begins at the outskirts of Duarte, which is named after 
Mexican Army Cpl. Andres Avelino Duarte. In 1841, Duarte was given a handsome 
stretch of ranch land at the base of the San Gabriel Mountains by Mexican Gov. 
Juan Alvarado. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Duarte, his title to the rancho was questioned, and he was 
involved in a lengthy court battle after California became a state. The U.S. 
Supreme Court upheld Duarte's land claim in 1878, but by the time he officially 
owned the land, he had had to sell all of it to pay legal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to trailhead: From the Foothill Freeway (210) in Duarte, exit on Mt. 
Olive Drive and head north to Royal Oaks Drive. Turn right and continue to 
Greenbank where you'll turn left, then to Deer Lane where you'll turn right, 
then to Mel Canyon Drive where you'll turn left. Park near Valley View Park. 
</P>
<P>
The Hike: From the end of Mel Canyon Drive, follow the unsigned footpath up the 
brushy slope. At first, the view isn't too inspiring. Down below you'll see the 
605 and 210 freeways in addition to the huge gravel pits of Irwindale, 
including "Raider Crater," the site proposed as the new home of the Los Angeles 
Raiders. The view to the east, where a quarry has chewed up mountainsides, 
isn't very inspiring either. 
</P>
<P>
The trail briefly joins a road and ascends to a fire department helipad, which 
does offer a pretty good view. On a clear day, you'll see the San Gabriel 
Valley, downtown Los Angeles and even Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Continue on the trail a short way past the helipad to an unsigned junction, 
where the trail joins Van Tassel Fire Road. You'll hike around a locked gate 
and begin some steep switchbacks. 
</P>
<P>
The dirt road climbs to a ridgeline and takes you past big cone spruce trees, 
which frame great views of the higher snow-covered San Gabriel peaks. Enjoy the 
panorama from 3,720-foot Mt. Bliss, catch your breath and return the same way.

SO MUCH FOR FREE SPEECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"From now on," said China's Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin, "newspapers, 
magazines, radio and television stations will never be allowed to disseminate 
bourgeois liberalization." Jiang's comments, made in a speech last November but 
only now published, describe a crackdown on the press that had in fact begun 
months earlier and that remains in force today. 
</P>
<P>
China's brief spring of relative freedom in news reporting -- part of the 
"bourgeois liberalization" condemned by the regime -- ended with last June's 
party-ordered massacre in Beijing. Now the press is again under onerous 
controls, while intimidation of foreign correspondents is being stepped up. 
</P>
<P>
This week the Foreign Correspondents' Club in Beijing formally protested to the 
Foreign Ministry over what it charged are flagrant efforts to harass foreign 
reporters and insulate them from contacts with the Chinese. Correspondents say 
that they are kept under close surveillance by security forces and that many 
Chinese friends have been warned by their employers that they are being 
watched. British and American journalists say that police carrying recorders 
and cameras pursue them in public. 
</P>
<P>
China's journalists, insisted Jiang in his speech, must serve as "mouthpieces" 
to "give publicity . . . to the party's basic line." That's not a demand that 
can be placed on the world's press. What can be done, what is being done, is to 
make the conditions under which foreign reporters work deliberately difficult 
and unpleasant. The aim is to make it as hard as possible to get at the truth 
about what's going on. The irony is that the tactics being used themselves 
demonstrate a fundamental and harsh truth about what life is like in China 
today.

LEAKS IN THE CLEAN-AIR BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If it were an air-pollution-control device, you could say that the U.S. 
Senate's clean air bill sprang several leaks while it was being worked on at 
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the bill would launch the toughest attack the nation has ever made on 
acid rain, tighten up tailpipe emissions for cars in states outside of 
California and increase control of toxic air emissions. But in the compromise 
effort to make it acceptable to the Bush Administration, too often the 
deadlines come later and the emission standards are lower than in the Senate's 
version. 
</P>
<P>
For example, there is one truly curious provision that would let the 
Environmental Protection Agency set a ceiling of $5,000 per ton on the cost of 
emission controls a polluter could be required to install. For the three 
largest polluters in the Los Angeles Basin, whose incomes run to the billions 
of dollars a year, the provision would put a limit of something over $18 
million on what they could be required to pay to cut emissions. 
</P>
<P>
California's Senators, Democrat Alan Cranston and Republican Pete Wilson, say 
that they will try to plug as many of these leaks as possible. Wilson is 
bothered by, among other things, the way tailpipe emission limits in urban 
areas were increased from the original level. That is important because about 
one of every five cars on California roads was bought outside the state and 
thus is equipped with looser pollution controls than California cars. 
</P>
<P>
And toxics controls are too loose, a Wilson aide said. The bill is also silent 
on whether California could set tougher emission standards for its cars, power 
plants and other sources of pollution, a right the state has insisted on -- and 
used -- since the first federal air-pollution law was enacted back in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Despite polls showing a steady rise in public support for clean air, the 
battles over health standards and costs still make fashioning pollution law a 
real legislative jungle. It's mean work but, for Californians, the rewards are 
high.

KOHL: DANCING AROUND THE BORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The West German government's exercise of damage control on the politically 
sensitive issue of Poland's border is welcome and may even soothe Europe's 
nerves. But it would be even more soothing if Chancellor Helmut Kohl would 
simply say what needs saying. 
</P>
<P>
His hesitation stems from one of democracy's shabbier sights -- a politician 
avoiding candor in the hope of appealing to small numbers of voters on the 
fringe of an issue. Usually the only casualty is the politician's integrity. 
But with Kohl on Poland, that is the least of it. 
</P>
<P>
For political purposes, Kohl still refuses to say that a reunified Germany 
would honor the border with Poland that was set -- generally along the Oder and 
Neisse rivers -- after World War II. Why? Because a relatively small number of 
Germans want the prewar borders restored, a position that drives Poles up the 
wall and reminds the rest of Europe and its allies that it was the Third 
Reich's craving for land that led to war in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
The United States' position is clear enough. While Kohl kept dancing all around 
the issue at Camp David, President Bush said after their recent meetings that 
"the U.S. recognizes the current . . . border"; Secretary of State James A. 
Baker III said Tuesday that the border is "inviolable." 
</P>
<P>
What Kohl is doing would be bad enough under any circumstances, but the 
election for which he is trying to scoop up fringe votes will not take place 
until December. The harm he will do to the cause of freedom and peace in Europe 
if he plays this game until then cannot be exaggerated. A spokesman in Bonn 
says that the parliaments of both Germanys could vote to honor the existing 
border after next month's election in East Germany. That is a big help, but 
it's not really a substitute for some statesmanlike candor on Kohl's part.

ABORTION A CASE FOR CHOICE; 
</P>
<P>
RESTRICTIONS MEAN SUFFERING, DEATH; 
</P>
<P>
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN TERMINATION OF A PREGNANCY IS THE ONLY HUMANE ALTERNATIVE. 
BIRTH CONTROL, COUNSELING AND ADOPTION ARE BENEFICIAL, BUT THEY'RE NOT ENOUGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATE MICHELMAN and Kate Michelman is the executive director of NARAL. This 
article will also appear in slightly different form in Healthline magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The past year has been pivotal in the battle to protect the right to choose 
abortion. The Supreme Court ruling in Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services 
in July, and the nationwide political mobilization last fall, made abortion a 
dominant issue in the United States. State legislatures, Congress, the courts 
and the electorate will have to address abortion and the related issues of 
birth control and sex education. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion is a complex issue for everyone. It involves the most fundamental 
questions about religion, ethics, morality and the role of government in 
decisions involving family planning. It touches all Americans, from 
policy-makers to individual voters. But most important, it affects women with 
unwanted pregnancies and their families. 
</P>
<P>
The central question is simple. Who decides? Who should resolve these difficult 
issues that have arisen over abortion? Should it be politicians? Should it be 
those who call themselves "pro-life"? Or should it be the women and families 
directly involved? 
</P>
<P>
Those of us who support abortion rights believe that women and families must 
make these decisions for themselves, and that the choice in each case is an 
individual one. We are pro-choice, not "pro-abortion." 
</P>
<P>
Abortion is an issue about which there are deep and honest differences of 
opinion. We respect those differences. As difficult as it is morally for some 
people to accept abortion, we feel there is a greater wrong in forcing a woman 
to undergo the demanding, intimate and at times life-threatening experiences of 
pregnancy and childbirth. For some women, the pain and suffering of being 
denied the choice to end a pregnancy is so extreme that they have risked and 
lost their lives in order to avoid it. We defend the right of women to choose 
whether or not to have an abortion. We also work to prevent any parent, spouse, 
doctor or politician from ever forcing an abortion on any woman who does not 
want one. 
</P>
<P>
A small, extremist minority cannot be allowed to impose its views and take away 
our most fundamental liberty: the right to choose. This right establishes that 
an outsider cannot determine when or whether an individual may have a child. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-choice minority claims that human life begins at conception. In fact, 
there is no consensus about when human life begins. Certainly, women recognize 
that a fetus has the potential for human life. But "when human life begins" is 
a moral, religious, ethical and philosophical question. 
</P>
<P>
For 17 years Roe vs. Wade, the landmark decision legalizing abortion in all 50 
states, has been the law of the land. It provided that abortion in the first 
three months of pregnancy, defined as the first trimester, be free from 
government interference, and it established some limits on abortion in the 
second and third trimesters. Many politicians have placated anti-abortion 
forces by stating their personal opposition to abortion, but they have not had 
the power to act on it. In its 1989 decision in a Missouri case, Webster vs. 
Reproductive Health Services, the Supreme Court ruled that states could enact 
legislation that severely restricts abortion. The political aspect of the issue 
has taken on a new complexity. 
</P>
<P>
In some areas, anti-choice forces are asking politicians to translate their 
personal ambivalence into public policy by enacting onerous restrictions on 
abortion. On the other hand, the pro-choice majority will be scrutinizing the 
actions of elected officials. Pro-choice voters are making it clear to 
politicians who would restrict abortion that the consequence will be pregnant 
women forced either to bear unwanted children or to suffer the pain and 
degradation of illegal abortions. Many women will die. 
</P>
<P>
Consider also what happens to children who are born unwanted. Adoption can be 
an option for some women. But it is the worst kind of deceit to claim that 
there is a loving family waiting to adopt the child of every woman, from 
teen-age welfare mothers to drug addicts. 
</P>
<P>
Part of our work is preventing pregnancies and reducing the need for abortion. 
We support sex education and safe, accessible contraception. We work to ensure 
that every child is fed, housed and educated. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to have an abortion is not an easy one. We would all like to see 
fewer women facing crisis pregnancies and the wrenching decisions they involve. 
But, in reality, whether or not to have an abortion is a choice women often 
face. The world is not perfect; there will always be a need for abortion 
services. Women are entitled to make these decisions themselves, in 
consultation with families, trusted friends, religious counselors and doctors 
if they so wish. Politicians, extremists and clinic protesters have no right to 
interfere. 
</P>
<P>
As a nation we must trust women to use their personal judgment in making 
thoughtful, conscientious decisions regarding procreation. Sometimes, those 
decisions involve terminating a pregnancy. The National Abortion Rights Action 
League is committed to defending the right of all women to make these personal 
decisions, and to ensuring that abortion is accessible to all women who choose 
it.

REAGAN'S TAPED TESTIMONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former President Reagan's taped deposition for the trial of Adm. John 
Poindexter (Part A, Feb. 23) may act as a catalyst for some Americans to more 
closely scrutinize the qualifications of future presidential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Iran-Contra was the stuff of mental midgets. It started as a preposterous 
scheme to sell some of our most deadly weapons to a terrorist enemy in hopes of 
gaining the release of some of our hostages. There was apparently insufficient 
thought given to the plight of future hostages because of these actions, or to 
the impact this would have upon the Iran-Iraq war. 
</P>
<P>
According to the generally accepted account of Iran-Contra, once the President 
approved of the arms for hostages plan, he stepped out of the picture, and by 
so doing, gave his second-stringers the opportunity to rip-off the Ayatollah so 
that the people of Nicaragua could enjoy the fruits of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
President Reagan's defense of his actions in Iran-Contra is based upon the 
dubious characteristics of lousy judgment in approving the plan, formidable 
incompetence in not controlling the actions of his subordinates, and poor 
memory in not recalling many of the key details. All of these traits belong out 
of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
The legacies of Iran-Contra are found in our rightful expectations of future 
presidents. If we truly seek first-rate chief executives, then we should demand 
the most rigorous scrutiny of candidates by our political parties and by 
ourselves. On the other hand, if we are primarily interested in candidates who 
make us feel good by appearing presidential, individuals who are able to 
deliver good speeches, then we should hire actors.

CHAMORRO'S UPSET WIN IN NICARAGUA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since the United States now has to come up with more money to support the new 
Nicaraguan government, what say we take all the leftover arms from the Contras 
and sell them to moderates in Iran. Then we turn over the profits to Chamorro. 
</P>
<P>
Sounds like a "neat idea," don't you think?

SUPER MATH TEACHER JAIME ESCALANTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am not surprised that Escalante has decided to quit public school teaching. 
</P>
<P>
Escalante's success in teaching an academic discipline is an aberration in a 
school system that lobotomizes its students. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, those who begrudge his success would have offered him unconditional 
love, moral support and admiration had he been a championship football coach, 
the sponsor of a massive fund-raiser or one of the countless mindless, 
frivolous non-academic extracurricular frills that abound on the campus of 
every school, college and university throughout the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers who ask for academic reforms must be punished! Five years ago a former 
principal took away the French classes she knew I loved to teach, and last 
summer I was blacklisted when I applied for a French teaching position in 
another school. 
</P>
<P>
Our public schools will never improve until anti-academic administrators are 
replaced with those who will reward dedicated, brilliant, hard-working and 
gifted teachers like Escalante, instead of kicking them out of the school 
system!

REAGAN'S TAPED TESTIMONY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Incredible, isn't it? For eight years we had a President who knew nothing, did 
not want to know anything, had his wishes carried out by underlings with the 
unspoken directive to be told nothing -- to keep him the hell out of whatever 
was going on -- and we loved him for it, and seemingly still do. 
</P>
<P>
We prate and boast to the rest of the world of our beautiful democracy and 
suggest that it be emulated by one and all. 
</P>
<P>
Just who are we kidding? We are a bunch of idiots, nothing less, for knowing 
and putting up with this charade and reelecting him by an overwhelming 
majority, really knowing deep inside that he did not, could not cope with the 
immensity of his position and we laughed at it all. 
</P>
<P>
Are we still laughing? One wonders. Is there any limit to the gullibility and 
stupidity which we are still able to generate. 
</P>
<P>
Heaven help us all.

CHAMORRO'S UPSET WIN IN NICARAGUA

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A simple question regarding democracy and the Nicaraguan elections: Who showed 
more respect for democratic values? 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Ortega, who allowed a popular election to unseat his own presidency; or 
the Reagan-Bush Administration, that subverted, perverted and otherwise 
compromised our own moral and democratic principles in pursuit of its policy of 
terror and intimidation? 
</P>
<P>
If we are to accept the notion that the election outcome is a vindication of 
the Reagan-Bush policy, then we must also accept a revision of the popular 
quotation to read that "It is now possible for democracy to flow from the 
barrel of a gun."

Many people say that they were surprised by the Sandinistas defeat. Actually, 
there was nothing surprising because the election was a free choice between 
democracy and dictatorship, particularly at a time when overthrowing 
dictatorial rule has become a world trend. 
</P>
<P>
The Sandinistas defeat has vindicated the Reagan Administration's policy of a 
trade embargo against the Latin American communist state. There has been a lot 
of dispute among pundits and government officials about the effectiveness of 
the embargo. Some of them have maintained that it can only increase the 
suffering of the people and they have used this rationale to oppose further 
trade sanctions against China after Beijing's crackdown on the pro-democracy 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
They say that it was the trade embargo that drove the Sandinista regime to 
change the policy of bullets into a policy of ballots, and forced the South 
African government to make tremendous concessions to the black majority, but 
they have continued their efforts to ease trade sanctions against China. Isn't 
this contradictory? 
</P>
<P>
The Sandinista regime is gone, an end to the war in El Salvador is in sight. 
The development certainly has unnerved Fidel Castro in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
As the democracy movement is expanding and the people in every part of the 
world are rising up against dictators, I don't think Deng Xiaoping in the 
"People's" Republic of China can sleep well if he continues to suppress the 
aspirations of the people.

Torrey Pines' psychological edge was as important as its aggressiveness on the 
field against Bonita Vista Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The more-experienced Falcons had already defeated the Barons, 3-0, the most 
goals scored against Bonita Vista (26-2-2) this year. Torrey Pines had won the 
3-A San Diego Section title the past six of eight years and was undefeated. 
</P>
<P>
And so it wasn't that surprising that Torrey Pines (23-0-4) defeated Bonita 
Vista, 1-0, in the San Diego Section girls' 3-A final at Torrey Pines. 
</P>
<P>
"We were fighting their will to win," Bonita Vista Coach Ron Pietila said. 
"Torrey Pines was very confident." 
</P>
<P>
Said Christy Peters, Torrey Pines' junior midfielder: "We had a definite edge, 
but they had an edge in a different respect. They had nothing to lose; we did. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons had four objectives going into the game and managed to accomplish 
three: Dennis Costello became the first coach to win three consecutive girls' 
3-A section soccer championships. The Falcons remained undefeated for the first 
time in the three years Costello has been the coach. And Torrey Pines only 
allowed seven goals this season to tie Bonita Vista and break the Barons' 
record of eight allowed in both 1988 and '89. 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines wanted to reach 100 goals but fell one short. The Falcons did 
collect their 20th shutout as goalie Kyla Schmedding was forced to make few 
saves. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very close game tonight, right to the last minute," Costello said. 
"It was the kind of game that's very enjoyable for the crowd to watch -- a game 
between the No. 1- and 2-rated teams." 
</P>
<P>
Danielle Napoli, a 5-foot-1 1/2 senior, scored 12 minutes into the first half 
and finished the season with 31 goals. 
</P>
<P>
"We made a couple mistakes on defense," Pietila said. "We had two youngsters on 
defense who just weren't communicating. The girl with the most experience 
scored." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "We had opportunities late to score, but they're too good. I am very 
pleased with our effort."

Mention Point Loma in the same breath as girls' basketball, and the combination 
turns ordinarily composed young ladies into Jello. 
</P>
<P>
But when San Pasqual meets Point Loma for the Division II San Diego Section 
girls' title at 1:30 today, the mold will have already been set and hardened. 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago on Jan. 2, San Pasqual and Point Loma met in a preseason game in 
Escondido, and San Pasqual took a nail-biting, 53-52 victory in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"Then we were in the 'We're playing Point Loma' frame of mind," Terry Bamford, 
San Pasqual's second-year coach. "We tried to press the first half, but the 
fear factor was there." 
</P>
<P>
Granted, as Point Loma Coach Lee Trepanier and Bamford are quick to point out, 
the Pointers were without seniors Tyeast Brown and Ericka Crittenden. 
</P>
<P>
"We play a different kind of game without them," Trepanier said. "There were 
two different halves in that game. We won the first half, they won the second." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, it was a major energizer for San Pasqual (24-4), which is 
undefeated in 1990 and hasn't lost since a Christmas tournament in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a confidence booster for us," Bamford said. "It was a big game. To 
win one like that and come back when we were down 33-13 at the half, that was 
really great." 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded San Pasqual lost twice in Nevada, once to the University High of 
Irvine and once to Poway. Against University and Poway, Bamford, also the 
women's basketball coach at MiraCosta College, didn't arrive until the second 
and third quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Point Loma (26-3) lost its three games starting in the final of its 
own Ben Fischer Tournament Dec. 30 -- to Bakersfield North, 40-35 -- then its 
next two games to San Pasqual and Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time since 1978 that Point Loma had suffered three consecutive 
losses. It has won 14 since. 
</P>
<P>
Starting for Point Loma are forwards Brown (6-0, 23.5 points, nine rebounds per 
game) and Crittenden (5-8, 13.5, seven rebounds), senior center Robin Rabello 
(6-1, 12 points), junior guard Stacy Wainwright (5-8) and senior guard Claudine 
Neves (5-6). 
</P>
<P>
San Pasqual will counter with junior center Becki Callahan (5-11, 13.5), senior 
guards Nikki Gannon (5-5, 15.8) and Hope Licon (5-5, 7.0), sophomore forward 
Valerie Ryan (5-9, 10.0), and junior guard Jill Combe (5-6, 7.0). KIM Q.

POWAY THE HAPPIEST OF FINALISTS AFTER VICTORY

<P>
It was almost a San Diego Section championship game with two winners, or at 
least without a big loser. 
</P>
<P>
Poway claimed the boys' 3-A title with a 2-0 victory over Bonita Vista and 
celebrated when the final whistle blew. Just as the Titans should have. 
</P>
<P>
But over on the other sideline, there was little sulking. 
</P>
<P>
Seems the Barons were just happy to make it to the final game and set two 
section records on the way, one for most shutouts in a season (21) and another 
for fewest goals allowed in a season (six). 
</P>
<P>
But Poway got the shutout when it most counted. In fact, it was the fourth 
Poway goalie Scott Vasterling recorded during the playoffs and the 20th for 
Poway overall, which puts the Titans right behind Bonita Vista in the record 
book. 
</P>
<P>
Poway also put the ball in the back of the net when it counted, although the 
first goal came about after a controversial call. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan Yukubik, Bonita Vista's sweeper, was trying to control the ball near his 
own end line when Poway's Ryan Nutting came from behind and tried to steal it. 
</P>
<P>
The ball was kicked out of bounds. Yukubik thought he had been fouled in the 
ensuing tussle. Nutting allowed simply that he had kicked the ball out of 
bounds and that Bonita Vista should have been awarded a goal kick. 
</P>
<P>
The linesman saw it differently, giving Poway a corner kick. Kevin Arthur took 
it and sent the ball to the far post, from where Nutting headed it in with four 
minutes left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward no one on the Bonita Vista sideline was making excuses. 
</P>
<P>
"They took it to us," said Milt Shadoan, Bonita Vista coach. 
</P>
<P>
"We just wanted it more," said Bob Champion, Poway coach. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first full title for Poway and Champion, who has been the school's 
only soccer coach since starting the program 18 years ago. In 1987, Poway 
shared the championship with Valhalla. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans put it away with nine minutes remaining when Mike Sharp scored on a 
header off a crossing pass from Kevin Legg.

BASKETBALL: UCSD AND CHRISTIAN HERITAGE MARCH INTO POSTSEASON PLAY TO THE BEAT 
OF DIFFERENT DRUMMERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The UC San Diego and Christian Heritage men's basketball seasons have been as 
strikingly different as the institutions themselves. 
</P>
<P>
But there is one thing UCSD, one of the biggest science-oriented universities 
in the state, and Christian Heritage, a small college with a Christian-based 
curriculum, have in common. 
</P>
<P>
Both are still playing when many schools not in NCAA Division I have closed the 
locker doors on the 1989-90 season. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Heritage, making its third consecutive playoff appearance, will play 
Fresno Pacific in the semifinals of the NAIA District 3 tournament at 8 tonight 
at Whittier College. UCSD, playing in its first NCAA Division III tournament, 
will play at Nebraska Wesleyan at 5:30. 
</P>
<P>
While UCSD (20-6) started the season as a question mark, there seemed to be no 
question that Christian Heritage would be where it is now -- seeded No. 1 in 
the district and ranked No. 1 for the ninth consecutive week in the National 
Christian College Athletic Assn. poll. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks (28-5) had four returning starters, including two with NCAA Division 
I experience. And Christian Heritage's group had proven itself with a 24-9 
record and a No. 4 ranking in District 3 in 1988-'89. 
</P>
<P>
But the Tritons started the year as one of those maybe/maybe not teams. Even 
Coach Tom Marshall did not plan on a player who missed most of last year with 
injuries and academic problems meshing with a sophomore and a junior to form 
the core of one of the best Division III teams in the west. And UCSD had no 
seniors on the roster. 
</P>
<P>
But junior forward Tim Rapp fully recovered from his problems of the year 
before. Rick Batt followed up a freshman year where he was the team's leading 
rebounder by also becoming a scoring threat. And Gordon MacNeill, the team's 
MVP as a sophomore, continued to play well inside. 
</P>
<P>
"You have those three kids back, and you look at them on paper, and we look 
pretty good," Marshall said. "But you never know until they are on the floor 
performing for you. I don't think the coaches knew early in the season how good 
this team was. 
</P>
<P>
"After every win we would look at each other and say, 'We're a pretty good 
team.' It was like it was more surprising us as we went along, game after 
game." 
</P>
<P>
And now the Tritons will make their first playoff appearance against a program 
that has established itself as the benchmark in the West Region. Nebraska 
Wesleyan has reached the tournament the past seven years and advanced to the 
national semifinals three times. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD is playing a team it has faced only once. Christian Heritage is playing 
Fresno Pacific for the third time this season. The teams split their previous 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
The district tournament is a chance for the Hawks to prove that they were 
undervalued during the season. Westmont of Santa Barbara is seeded second in 
the tournament and was the only team in the district to be nationally ranked. 
The best Christian Heritage could get was its current honorable mention. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks, in only their fourth year of college basketball, have lost in the 
first round the past two seasons. A victory would put them in the final against 
the winner of the Westmont-Southern California College game Tuesday at Whittier 
College.

ARLOTTO NAMED TO ALL-CCAA FIRST TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Junior Julie Arlotto, who ranks fourth on the all-time Cal State Northridge 
scoring list, and senior Denna Mulverhill, also of CSUN, have been named to the 
All-California Collegiate Athletic Assn. women's basketball team in a vote 
among coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Arlotto, who averaged 12.7 points and 5.4 rebounds a game during the regular 
season, was a first-team selection. Mulverhill (10.0, 7.3) was named to the 
second team. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge senior Derrick Gathers and sophomore Kendell McDaniels received 
honorable mention on the All-CCAA men's team. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers, a second-team selection last season, was the Matadors' leading scorer 
(17.6) and rebounder (7.1). McDaniels averaged 11.0 points and 6.4 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
LaVar Ball of Cal State Los Angeles, a former standout at Canoga Park High, was 
named to the first team. Ball averaged 16.0 points and 9.0 rebounds for the 
Golden Eagles, who qualified for the CCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Tressie Millender, a 5-foot-10 sophomore forward for College of the Canyons, 
was the unanimous choice as Western State Conference Player of the Year in a 
vote by conference coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Millender was the leading scorer in the conference with an 18.7 average and she 
grabbed 8.7 rebounds per game. Millender, the first Canyons woman selected for 
the honor, was joined on the six-player Southern Division first team by fellow 
forward and teammate Dawn Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
Valley Coach Doug Michelson was named coach of the year after leading the Lady 
Monarchs to the conference title. 
</P>
<P>
Other Valley-area first-team selections included Debra Rabin and Cindy Wiley of 
Moorpark in the Northern Division and Sandrine Rocher of Valley in the Southern 
Division. 
</P>
<P>

JUNIOR COLLEGE STATE BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS;

MOORPARK, GLENDALE UNDERMINE SEEDINGS

<P>
If a lesson has been learned thus far in the men's junior college state 
basketball playoffs, it is that rankings, seedings and the cozy confines of a 
home court can mean next to nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley and Valley colleges, which were seeded among the top six teams 
from the southern portion of the state, found out the hard way. Both schools' 
teams were upset at home in second-round games Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
And those teams of double-digit seedings, Glendale and Moorpark? Well, they 
hope the trend continues. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale, seeded 11th, bounced host Cerritos, the defending state champion, out 
of the playoffs with a 71-63 victory. Visiting Moorpark, seeded 13th, took out 
fourth-seeded Antelope Valley, 85-76. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams will be on the road again for round-of-16 games beginning at 7:30 
tonight. Glendale (24-11) will play at third-seeded Rancho Santiago (28-3), and 
Moorpark (23-10) will travel to Huntington Beach to meet Golden West (23-10). 
</P>
<P>
Glendale faces a particularly tall order in Rancho Santiago, which has a pair 
of 6-foot-9 bookends in Corie Blount and Matthew Lien. However, the Vaqueros 
have hurdled sizable obstacles before. 
</P>
<P>
In a tournament game early in the season, Glendale felled top-seeded Cypress, 
whose front-line players average 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros' tallest starter is Dave Swanson, a 6-5 sophomore, but if Coach 
Brian Beauchemin is concerned, he is hiding it well. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we're scared of anyone at this point," said Beauchemin, whose 
team has won nine of its past 10. "You look at the top six seeds and we've beat 
four of them, so, you know, line 'em up. Really. And it doesn't bother us where 
we have to go, either." 
</P>
<P>
Like Glendale, which regularly trims close to 20 points off opponents' scoring 
averages, Moorpark is at its best playing tenacious defense. 
</P>
<P>
"When we're playing well, we're a step quicker on defense, we just have great 
movement," Raider Coach Al Nordquist said. "The other thing we show is the 
ability to move the ball and make good choices with our shots. Against Antelope 
Valley, we did both of those things." 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's winners advance to the eight-team state tournament that begins 
Thursday at UC Irvine's Bren Center.

NORTHRIDGE BASKETBALL: WIN SOME, LOSE SOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Northridge played 841 men's basketball games in the 32 seasons it 
competed at the NCAA Division II level, winning 420 and losing 421. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Pete Cassidy, who has a career record of 284-223, won 115 CCAA games and 
lost 113 over a span of 19 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, the last season it earned a berth in the Division II playoffs, CSUN 
is 66-68 overall. 
</P>
<P>
Tentatively speaking: The 1989-90 basketball schedule that Northridge listed 
inside the back cover of its media guide was tentative at best. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors will not play road games at Wyoming, Xavier and Dayton nor will 
they play a home game against Virginia Commonwealth as previously reported. 
However, CSUN will play host to Lamar. 
</P>
<P>
Hit list: Northridge has reportedly expressed interest in recruiting Glendale 
College basketball players Bruce Heicke, Justin Lord and Gary Fowler. 
</P>
<P>
Conspicuous by his absence from that list is Dave Swanson, a 6-foot-5 sophomore 
who scored 27 points and grabbed 11 rebounds in the Vaqueros' 71-63 win 
Wednesday over defending state champion Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
Swanson, a gifted leaper with a nice outside shot, transferred to Glendale from 
. . . Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Two-liners: It has not taken long for Cal Lutheran's multitalented Brenda Lee 
to adjust from playing basketball to softball. On Thursday, a day after scoring 
a team-high 12 points in CLU's basketball playoff loss to Biola, Lee blasted a 
grand slam for the Regal softball team against Cal State Dominguez Hills . . . 
</P>
<P>
Denny Vigo, CSUN's sophomore third baseman, hit four home runs in three games 
last week, giving him six this season. He had three in 187 at-bats last season 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
You won't find the Glendale College men's basketball team playing zone defense 
because Coach Brian Beauchemin says it "sets you up for getting burned too many 
ways." Adds Beauchemin, "The game is different now with the three-point shot 
and so many players who can run the floor and do so many things." 
</P>
<P>
Best of a bad situation: The play of Occidental center Chris Anderson was one 
of the few bright spots in a disappointing basketball season for the Tigers, 
who finished 10-14 overall and 6-6 in the Southern California Intercollegiate 
Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, a senior, was selected to the second-team NCAA Division III All-West 
region team. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental's fifth-place finish was its worst in five years. 
</P>
<P>
Piping hot: Moorpark basketball Coach Al Nordquist says he would advise Golden 
West, his team's opponent tonight in the state junior college basketball 
tournament's round of 16, to go out to defend Raider point guard Sam Crawford 
when he's on the perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been shooting the lights out from three-point range," Nordquist said. 
"They had better get out on his butt. But then, if they do go out, he'll 
probably just go around them." 
</P>
<P>
Such has been the dilemma for Moorpark opponents all season. Exactly how hot 
Crawford has been of late Nordquist isn't quite sure. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been good with statistics like that," he said. "I just know the 
generalities and I can tell you this -- he's been cookin.' "

JORDAN, UC RIVERSIDE SHUT DOWN NORTHRIDGE IN ROUTINE FASHION, 6-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In Friday's California Collegiate Athletic Assn. game between Cal State 
Northridge and UC Riverside at the Riverside Sports Center, there was little of 
the drama and emotion present the last time the schools met in May. 
</P>
<P>
In that game at Riverside, two players and two coaches from Northridge were 
ejected and an umpire left the field in the wake of a controversial call. 
</P>
<P>
But in Riverside's 6-2 victory on Friday, the Highlanders' Bill Jordan (4-1) 
left little doubt about the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
The sophomore right-hander, who pitched in relief in last season's game, 
scattered five hits in eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jordan's teammates pounded out 10 hits, including five for extra 
bases, and never trailed. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year's game was chaotic, it was really crazy," said Jordan, remembering 
last year's game in which the Matadors won, 12-10, on a three-run homer by 
Denny Vigo in the top of the ninth. "There have been some emotional games 
between us. We have developed somewhat of a rivalry. It was important for us to 
win." 
</P>
<P>
Riverside (15-5, 6-2 in conference play) moved past Northridge (10-7, 5-2) into 
first place. The teams will meet again today at 1 p.m. at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside took a 2-0 lead in the fourth inning on Chad Townsend's towering 
400-foot home run over the 25-foot-high right-center-field wall. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors cut Riverside's advantage to 2-1 in the top of the fifth when 
Scott Richardson (two for four) scored from first on Greg Shockey's double. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside countered with two runs in the bottom of the inning on a triple by 
Pete Weber (three for four), who also had a single and a double, and a double 
by Ruben Ayala to take a 4-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We just never got going," Northridge Coach Bill Kernen said. "That's the story 
of the game. We didn't play badly. We made some mistakes. They took advantage 
of them and scored." 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors scored their final run in the eighth when Mike Solar came home on 
a bases-loaded walk with two out. But the rally ended when Craig Clayton 
grounded out. KIRBY LEE

CORONADO TITLE DEFEATS IMPERIAL, STEREOTYPE

<P>
Hey, all you water polo and tennis players, listen up. The Coronado boys' 
basketball team won the Division IV San Diego Section championship Friday with 
a 63-53 victory over Imperial at Golden Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Nyah-nyah nyah nyah-nyah nyah. 
</P>
<P>
"We're stereotyped as a tennis and water polo school," said 6-foot-3 center 
Derek Wastila, who scored 19 points. "Little do they know we have some talent 
out here." 
</P>
<P>
Enough, in fact, to win the school's first section basketball championship. 
This team also won Coronado's first league championship since 1963, finishing 
atop the newly formed City Harbor League. 
</P>
<P>
"All they hear is tennis and water polo," Coronado Coach Bob Stanton said. "But 
we've beaten some pretty good teams this year. This wasn't a fluke." 
</P>
<P>
Still, people have been telling guard Paul Carter for years that he should 
transfer to a real basketball school. He didn't listen. 
</P>
<P>
"I stuck it out for four years," he said. "And I'm pretty satisfied with my 
career here." 
</P>
<P>
Carter ended it with an exclamation point, scoring nine points and assisting 
his teammates on a rather amazing accomplishment in the third quarter, when 
Coronado (19-8) outscored Imperial 18-2. Imperial, which used a balanced 
offense to build a 33-29 halftime lead, managed only a pair of free throws in 
the third quarter. Forward Brian Williams' half-court prayer at the conclusion 
of the period, which bounced around the rim and out, was the closest thing 
Imperial had to a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
"I think their size and strength wore us down a little," Imperial Coach Kerry 
Legarra said. "We just quit moving and maybe that was because of fatigue." 
</P>
<P>
If Imperial (16-8) was tired, it wasn't extinct. Trailing, 47-35, at the end of 
the third quarter, the Tigers trimmed Coronado's lead to eight with less than 
three minutes remaining. Then, when Imperial forward Erik Mellas drove for a 
layup, Wastila swatted Mellas' shot halfway to Orange County, and Carter wound 
up with a layup on the other end. 
</P>
<P>
"I do tend to feast on the smaller teams," Wastila said. 
</P>
<P>
A basket and three free throws down the stretch by forward Adam Smith, who 
scored 19 points to share game-high honors with Wastila, helped preserve the 
victory, Coronado's second over Imperial this season. 
</P>
<P>
One key to this victory was Stanton's decision to change the defense in the 
third quarter from a box-and-one, designed to shut down forward/center Brian 
Williams, to a two-three zone. Williams managed just nine points, and the 
defensive switch threw Imperial's offense out of kilter. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of their shots came easy," Legarra said. "And a lot of ours came very, 
very hard." 
</P>
<P>
But Legarra wasn't completely dissatisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"How many teams," he asked, "score two points in one quarter and are still in 
the ball game?"

CHRISTIAN CHANCES BEGIN, END WITH CLARK

Christian High Coach Randy Wright promises no gimmicks on offense against 
Calipatria in the San Diego Section Division V boys' championship basketball 
game this morning at 11:30 at Golden Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not too complicated," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Christian's offense begins and usually ends with Tony Clark, the state's 
leading scorer at more than 44 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
In Christian's three playoff games, Clark has averaged 50 points, including a 
section record 64-point performance last week. In Wednesday's 57-50 semifinal 
victory over Bishop's, Clark scored 40. 
</P>
<P>
What kind of defense does Wright expect Calipatria to play against Clark? 
</P>
<P>
"We've seen it all this year," he said. "We're ready for anything." 
</P>
<P>
Wright said he has felt a lot better since off guard Brad Fox returned from a 
thigh injury that caused him to miss more than half the season. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the glue that holds us together," he said. "He also gives us another 
threat on offense." 
</P>
<P>
Since Fox returned to the lineup a month ago, Christian (15-11) has lost only 
to St. Augustine and Kearny, both Division III quarterfinalists. 
</P>
<P>
Wright said Christian has also been getting fine play from forward David 
Piester, who had nine points against Bishop's. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Calipatria (21-3) advanced to the finals by defeating Marian, 47-39, 
in the semifinals. Raul Novarro was the team's leading scorer with a 15-point 
average.

Holtville senior Teresa Ibarra just wanted one more basketball championship 
patch to sew on her letterman jacket. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed a third patch to fill up my sleeve," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She got it Friday when Holtville defeated Coronado, 57-31, in the San Diego 
Section Division IV girls' basketball final at Golden Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Holtville went into the game as two-time Division IV defending champion, having 
defeated Coronado by 24 and 13 points in previous finals. But Friday's game was 
expected to be closer. In the second game of the season, Holtville (18-9) 
defeated Coronado (14-11) by just five after Coronado had built a 10-point 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it would be a two- or three-point ball game either way," Holtville 
Coach Mike Pacheco said. "It was great to have a game like this. It makes my 
job easier." 
</P>
<P>
Coronado trailed by 18, 41-23, at the end of the third quarter and did not 
score again until three minutes remained. The Islanders were outscored, 16-8, 
in the fourth quarter. Their leading scorer, Kris Skaalan, managed just eight 
points. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Coronado Coach Ernie Dickerson) has seen our press," Pacheco said. "We 
pressed them the last time, and that's how we won. They didn't look as ready or 
prepared for the press as I thought they would be. Maybe he was prepared, and 
it just didn't work. We tried to throw them with a two-three zone and never 
went to a man-to-man." 
</P>
<P>
Holtville took a 12-6 first-quarter lead and then broke the game open, making 
it 31-11 by halftime. Senior Denise Gaddis scored nine of her 11 points in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
Ibarra, a 5-1 guard, worked hard for her patch. She scored 21 points, including 
two three-pointers in the second quarter and two more, on consecutive shots, in 
the fourth. Ibarra said she doesn't concentrate on shooting from that range. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever I have an open shot I shoot," she said. "He (Pacheco) always tells me 
I never shoot enough and to shoot more." 
</P>
<P>
Said Pacheco: "Teresa delivered like a senior should. It didn't surprise me 
that she led the team today. Too bad she's not 6-1."

NO. 1 SWEETWATER WINS TITLE, PUTS DOUBTERS, MT. CARMEL TO REST

<P>
There were doubters, no doubt, all year long about the Sweetwater High boys' 
basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
People wondered if the little team from National City -- one that starts five 
players listed as guards -- could win the San Diego Section Division I 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess you could say we're No. 1 now," Sweetwater Coach David Ybarra shouted 
above the noise of a rambunctious crowd of 3,125 that witnessed Sweetwater's 
78-71 victory Friday over Mt. Carmel at Golden Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Since Sweetwater was the No. 1 seeded team in the tournament and had lost just 
one game all year, it was not an upset, but there were many who felt Mt. Carmel 
had the better team because of its overwhelming size advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"Height shouldn't mean anything," said Joe McDowell, Sweetwater's 6-foot-2 
senior. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't appear to. 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater rebounded well, shot well, it made free throws when it had to -- 11 
of 12 in the fourth quarter -- and had just a handful of turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Campbell, Sweetwater's tallest player at 6-4, finished with a game-high 
29 points. John Gilbert had 21, including three three-pointers, and McDowell 
added 17 points and 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Carmel, behind 6-9 Shane Knight's 29 points, still had a shot late, pulling 
to within 75-71 with 51 seconds left. But Sweetwater (29-1) kept its composure 
and knocked down some key free throws. 
</P>
<P>
"What was the difference in the game? We made our free throws and got good 
pressure defense," Ybarra said. 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater won its first section basketball title in 10 years. Mt. Carmel was 
in its first final in the 17-year history of the school. The Sundevils, 
co-champions of the Palomar League, will finish 23-6 unless it earns at 
at-large berth in the Southern California Regionals next week. Sweetwater, of 
the Metro Conference, advanced automatically. 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater led by two (18-16) at the end of the first quarter, and by 10 
(41-31) at halftime. McDowell/Campbell/Gilbert and Co. were determined to see 
to it that the pace was rapid. And backed by a resounding crowd, they 
succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
McDowell and Campbell each had six points in the first quarter. Then in the 
second quarter, Campbell was nearly unstoppable. 
</P>
<P>
Despite playing with two fouls incurred early in the game, Campbell scored 11 
points on five-of-five shooting, including a monster two-hand slam on a fast 
break pass from McDowell. He also ended the half with a nifty 12-foot jumper on 
which he ended up on his backside. 
</P>
<P>
That Mt. Carmel stayed as close as it did is a credit to Knight, who had 14 
points, four rebounds and two blocks in the half. With nine points in the third 
quarter, he was instrumental in bringing Mt. Carmel to within, 54-51, with 2:10 
to play.

But then Campbell made a 12-footer, a three-pointer and a free throw and 
Gilbert a three-pointer to give Sweetwater a 9-2 run and a another 10-point 
lead, 63-53, to end the third quarter.

CHAMORRO'S UPSET WIN IN NICARAGUA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With all due respect for the retirement philosophy of one of history's greatest 
generals, Douglas MacArthur, the freedom-fighter Contras shouldn't lay down 
their arms forthwith, and "just fade away" into the Nicaraguan hills. 
</P>
<P>
Why demobilize an existing viable force for protecting the new democracy from 
internal subversion? 
</P>
<P>
Rather, these soldiers who, with only irregular U.S. support, fought long and 
hard for the democracy they now have, deserve an opportunity to use their hard 
earned experience and special skills to help preserve it! 
</P>
<P>
What better way to demonstrate true unity in Nicaragua than for these soldiers 
(sans former hard-core Somoza supporters) to be offered positions as fully 
legitimate regulars in the Nicaraguan defense and police forces -- answerable 
directly to President Chamorro or her own ministers? 
</P>
<P>
This would not have to be inconsistent with achieving the goal of an overall 
reduction in the size of the army, since there are probably tens of thousands 
of unwilling Sandinista conscripts eager to return to civilian life.

I wonder if we would be dragging ourselves through the murky waters of the

I also wonder if Reagan's detractors might be a little more charitable and 
think of him not in terms of that failure, but as the American President who 
walked through Red Square with Mikhail Gorbachev -- and quite possibly changed 
the political climate of the world in so doing.

APOLLO LEADER LEE GRAY DIES AT WEST POINT; 
</P>
<P>
SPACE INDUSTRY: THE LONGTIME ORANGE COUNTY RESIDENT ALSO WORKED ON THE SHUTTLE 
PROGRAM. HE RECENTLY WAS CORPORATE VICE PRESIDENT FOR LEACH CORP. IN BUENA 
PARK.

<P>
Lee Bond Gray, a longtime Orange County resident who worked on the Apollo and 
space shuttle programs, has died at the age of 59. 
</P>
<P>
Gray suffered a fatal heart attack Feb. 24 in West Point, N.Y., where he was 
attending a meeting of the board of trustees of the U.S. Military Academy. He 
had served on the board for the past 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Only three weeks ago, Gray and his wife, Nancy, sold their Yorba Linda home and 
moved to Tennessee, where they planned to spend their retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Born in St. Johnsbury, Vt., Gray served as a fighter pilot after graduating 
from West Point in 1953. He later received his master's degree in business 
administration from Pepperdine University. 
</P>
<P>
Gray's 30-year career in the aerospace and electronics engineering industry 
began in 1955 when he accepted a position with North American Aviation in El 
Segundo, which later merged with Rockwell International Corp. 
</P>
<P>
He went on to serve as director of quality assurance for the Apollo command 
module after the launch pad fire that killed three astronauts. He also led a 
team for the President's Commission on the nuclear accident at Three Mile 
Island and provided expert testimony to the congressional committee 
investigating the Challenger space shuttle disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Gray was a resident of Los Alamitos from 1964 to 1978 while he worked in the 
Apollo program for Rockwell. He later directed the quality assurance program 
during the developmental stages of the space shuttle program. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, he left California to direct a multi-billion dollar program for the 
Department of Energy in Oak Ridge, Tenn. But he returned in 1984 when he 
accepted a position as corporate vice president for Leach Corp., an electronics 
firm in Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
His son, Gary Gray, said Friday that his father looked forward to his 
retirement in Loudon, Tenn. "He was energetic, outgoing and an extremely hard 
worker," Gary Gray said. "He was really dedicated to assisting the (military 
academy's) admissions office in getting young people to attend West Point."

MEDICAL COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial "Money Problems From Birth" (Feb. 23) very concisely described a 
complex problem, and I salute you for your analysis. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer and fewer hospitals have contracted with Medi-Cal as California covers 
less and less of the costs of providing health care. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates are that Medi-Cal covers only 60% of the cost of providing such care. 
That may be one reason that although 268 hospitals contracted with Medi-Cal in 
1985, only 238 did so in 1989, with more facilities deciding to withdraw each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the Medi-Cal bureaucracy has made it more difficult to bill and 
collect monies owed. 
</P>
<P>
Medi-Cal does not "provide appropriate medical care." Physicians working in 
their offices and in hospitals provide medical care. Until government 
recognizes that, we will continue to go from crisis to crisis.

AUTHOR CRITIQUES SINGLE LIFE COLUMN

<TEXT>
<P>
(Re: Single Life column, Jan. 19) Anyone who uses avuncular must be able to 
read, not misread. So, I'm certain (writer Evan Cummings) deliberately and 
maliciously misrepresented my primary views and advice regarding: choosing and 
advocating young women with smarts as well as stressing the importance of being 
oneself and knowing what one is doing and why one is doing it. 
</P>
<P>
Since you must be a together person who isn't "pretending to be someone you're 
not so you can get someone you really don't want," perhaps you'd write fair, 
honest reviews of "Jennifer Fever" and "Loving a Younger Man." The heroines, 
well-over-35 women, in those books ended up marrying younger men. Of course, 
the younger men are, according to the authoresses, sensitive and easily taken 
for bisexuals or gays. Methinks those are the "real Real Men" you'd like to 
hear from to tell you it isn't so.

NIXON'S HELEN GAHAGAN DOUGLAS ATTACK CALLED DIRTY TRICKS FORERUNNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read (Joseph N. Bell's) column regularly. I too am a Democrat in this County 
of Orange. You have hit on some themes that I have responded to in my mind but 
never took action to write. 
</P>
<P>
However the Feb. 1 column on the Nixon questions which I copied and mailed to 
my daughter still lingers in my unanswered letter file. 
</P>
<P>
"His life passed before me in Technicolor bursts. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
I could have written that! Richard Nixon, the politician, came into my home by 
way of a mailer designed to defeat my candidate Helen Gahagan Douglas. It was 
the forerunner of all the "dirty tricks" I came to recognize as Nixon's 
trademark. The mailer came the day before Election Day and would you believe? 
It was printed on pink paper -- dirty, Commie Pinkos -- the McCarthy touch. I 
rejected that man that day and only despaired further each time he gained 
another political victory. 
</P>
<P>
I am dismayed by the apathy of young people (and some older folks) because they 
don't bother to vote. But when a man of this stripe is hailed as a great leader 
I can understand why they are turned off. 
</P>
<P>
The mailer made such an impression on my voting habits that I now look at each 
one -- not at the message -- but at the small print in the corner that tells me 
who paid for the mailing. In many local elections I have voted not for or 
against the issue or the candidate -- but against the mailer itself.

dumped me -- how many times I have fantasized he would call; he hasn't yet, but 
someday he will. And then. . . .

<P>
Everybody at the office, men and women both loved it. Everybody read it and we 
passed it along and put it on the bulletin board.

BELL COLUMNS THAT BROUGHT PLEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frequently I find (Joseph Bell's) columns to be the most satisfactory in our 
entire Orange County Times. Considering that I do check most of the editorial 
and opinion pieces quite carefully I intend this to be a sincere compliment to 
(Bell). 
</P>
<P>
(The Feb. 10) column on our soft-spoken congressman (Rep. Robert K. Dornan) 
brought me great pleasure. You have a talent for stating facts gently yet 
forcefully. 
</P>
<P>
The column after your visit to Jimmy Carter's church was another that remains 
in my memory as well as my collection. It was shared with friends too. How 
satisfactory now that others are beginning to realize Jimmy Carter's worth. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago I was in an audience and watched Robert Dornan's ridiculous 
behavior as he made it clear that our peace-oriented meeting did not meet with 
his approval. 
</P>
<P>
I, too, hope that Alan Alda has an opportunity to adjust Robert Dornan's tie.

PROTESTERS TAKE AIM AT DOE, FAWN HUNTING; 
</P>
<P>
ANIMAL RIGHTS: SAN DIEGO COUNTY'S DEER POPULATION HAS DECLINED 87% IN 40 YEARS, 
CLAIM ACTIVISTS, WHO ARE PUSHING FOR A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY OF THE ANIMAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
About 20 animal-rights activists picketed a California Fish and Game Commission 
meeting Friday morning to protest deer hunting in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with placards that said, "Conserve Wildlife -- Harvest a Hunter" and 
"Shoot With Cameras, Not Guns," the activists trooped up and down the 1300 
block of Front Street in clear view of the hunters, politicians and 
conservationists going into the State Building to attend the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a meeting to decide what to kill, how to kill it and how long to kill 
it," said Sally Mackler of San Diego Animal Advocates, the group that arranged 
the protest to call for a countywide moratorium on the hunting of does and 
fawns. Unless San Diegans "stop shooting and start studying" their dwindling 
deer population, Mackler said, "there won't be any left." 
</P>
<P>
Mackler and others contend that, because of drought, increased development and 
hunting in San Diego County, the local deer herd has declined 87% in 40 years. 
The last comprehensive study of deer population was completed in 1949, Mackler 
said, when 26,000 deer lived in the county. In 1988, the state Department of 
Fish and Game estimated only 3,400 deer remained. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed moratorium on the hunting of so-called "antlerless deer" has won 
support from the county Fish and Wildlife Advisory Commission and the County 
Board of Supervisors. In a letter dated Feb. 8, Supervisor Leon L. Williams, 
the board chairman, urged the state Fish and Game Commission to suspend the 
antlerless deer hunt, usually held in October, until deer habitat and 
distribution can be studied. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, members of the state commission asked staff to study the impact of 
decreasing the length of deer season for all types of deer. The season extends 
five months, said Mackler, with 30 days allowed for hunting does and fawns. The 
commission will make its final decision April 26. 
</P>
<P>
Karen O'Rourke, a councilwoman from Lemon Grove, said she was prompted to speak 
out about the dwindling deer population because she believes the county may be 
in danger of losing the quiet, graceful animals altogether. 
</P>
<P>
"We own a weekend home in Mt. Laguna, and, in the three years of feeding and 
watering these deer, we've seen four," she said. "Especially during these 
thirsty summers, if they were there, we'd see them. I don't believe they're 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1988, there were 8,200 (hunting) permits available (in San Diego County) -- 
5,500 were sold to kill 3,400 deer. That's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Turner, a Campo resident who said he is a lifelong hunter, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"The deer population is going down and down, and Fish and Game is making no 
effort to reverse that trend," he said. "I'm from the old school -- in my 
house, every gun is loaded. . . . But I want doe hunting stopped." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Kughn, a lobbyist for the Southern Border Archery Assn. and for the 
California Bowman Hunters and State Archery Assn., countered that a moratorium 
would "put the entire herd at risk." Kughn said the main problem deer face in 
the county is that development has driven them to the backcountry, where older, 
less-nutritious plant growth provides them a poor diet. 
</P>
<P>
"Hunting is a management tool," he said. "It keeps the herd in check. . . . If 
they die on the ground of starvation, it's a waste of a natural resource." 
</P>
<P>
Kughn also defended hunting and the people who enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not good old boys who run through the woods with spears," he said. 
"We're normal family men. I enjoy the sport." 
</P>
<P>
Outside on the picket line, tempers clashed. As animal-rights activists 
strutted back and forth on the sidewalk with a banner that said "Stop Hunting 
Does and Fawns. No More Slaughter," a hunter pushed past the banner, knocking 
it out of Stan Phillips' hands. With fists clenched, Phillips and the hunter 
exchanged harsh words before the hunter went inside. Later, however, the two 
men shook hands.

"The ocean is different," he says. "You go out there, you were always breathing

The 27-year-old San Pedro resident, who has worked around the waterfront since 
he was a teen-ager, is one of two crew members who survived the sinking of the 
tugboat Barcona last June. The tug went down off the coast of Long Beach when a 
nuclear-powered Navy submarine -- on hand for the filming of "The Hunt for Red 
October" -- snagged a cable from the vessel and yanked it under water, drowning 
the vessel's pilot. 
</P>
<P>
The movie, which is about a Soviet submarine commander's defection to the 
United States, opened in Los Angeles and theaters across the country Friday. 
But there are three people, at least, who are not rushing to the theater doors: 
Mike Link, the tugboat's captain and other surviving crew member; Janet 
Ballanger, the widow of pilot Bryan Ballanger, and Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they are trying to reorder their lives. Janet Ballanger, who declines 
to talk to the press, is struggling to raise two young children alone, 
according to her lawyer, who described her as "a strong woman who had dealt 
with it, I suppose, as well as anybody could." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, whose knees were injured in the accident, is in school learning to 
repair air conditioners and refrigerators. He says his mind was affected as 
well: "It's a pretty heavy load I'm carrying." 
</P>
<P>
Link, a 38-year-old father of three, says he still suffers nightmares. And 
despite his hearty love for the open water, he no longer captains ocean-going 
tugs. 
</P>
<P>
"I work exclusively inside now," Link says, meaning he works only inside the 
breakwater that protects Los Angeles Harbor. "After an experience like that, I 
just didn't want to ever have the possibility of having something like that 
ever happen again. I didn't want to tempt fate." 
</P>
<P>
The accident, which is apparently without precedent in U.S. Navy history, 
occurred June 14. The Barcona was on an overnight trip from Santa Catalina 
Island to Long Beach, tugging two barges of quarried rock that was to be used 
in a landfill construction project. Link and Rodriguez were asleep below deck, 
while Ballanger was guiding the tugboat through a thick fog in water 2,500 feet 
deep. 
</P>
<P>
At 4:45 a.m., the Houston, a fast-attack submarine based in San Diego, snagged 
one of the steel tow cables linking the tug to its barges. The boat was pulled 
downward so fast, and with such force, that the crew had no idea what had 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
"From the time I woke up until the time I finally got out of the tug was 35 to 
40 seconds," Link recalls. "By the time I escaped, we were still 15 to 20 feet 
under water and I was still trying to get out of the wheel house." 
</P>
<P>
Link and Rodriguez both swam to the safety of the barges. Ballanger, 32, was 
last seen going below deck to check on the Barcona's engines. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board are still 
investigating the incident; a report is expected this spring. A Navy 
investigation, the results of which were released to reporters in censored form 
this week, discovered that the crew of the Houston correctly identified the 
tugboat but did not realize it was towing barges. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy found officers aboard the Houston disagreed over what to do when the 
submarine hit the towing line. The duty officer decided to sound a collision 
alarm but was overruled by his commanding officer, who ordered an emergency 
dive. Minutes later, the Houston's skipper, Cmdr. John Sohl, ordered the crew 
to shut down the sub's engines in an attempt to ease the pull on the cable -- 
which the crew mistakenly thought was a fishing net. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy's conclusions about who deserved blame for the accident were censored 
out of its report. A Navy spokeswoman said no Houston crew member lost his job 
as a result of the Barcona sinking, although Sohl was later relieved of his 
command for a series of incidents involving the submarine, including the tug 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
And, while no lawsuits have been filed against the Navy in connection with the 
Barcona, lawyer James Zorigan said he has filed a claim against the Navy on 
behalf of the Ballangers and Rodriguez. And the president of Connolly-Pacific 
Co., which owned the Barcona, said he is negotiating with the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
The Barcona was never raised. 
</P>
<P>
After the sinking, Rodriguez said, he and Link went out in another company 
tugboat and held a memorial service for Ballanger on the ocean. A Navy vessel 
came by to pay its respects; Rodriguez said he was miffed that Paramount 
Pictures, which produced "The Hunt for Red October," did not do the same. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have thought that out of common courtesy or respect there would have 
been some kind of regards sent to the family of Bryan," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Don Levy, a publicist for Paramount, says the accident had nothing to do with 
the movie, in which the Houston portrays an American submarine. "What happened 
happened while the vessel was on a naval maneuver," he said. "It was separate 
and apart, not connected to the motion picture." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the movie's release has touched a raw nerve among those whose 
lives were forever changed by the Houston's presence off the coast last June 
14. "All I can say," Link says, "is I don't think the cost justifies the end 
result." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Rodriguez, unlike his former captain and Ballanger's wife, says he may go 
see the film -- not right away, but at some point. He says he knows it will be 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Then why put himself through it? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," he says, sighing. "Sometimes you've got to find a reason to 
live."

AFTERSHOCK JARS NERVES BUT IT DAMAGES LITTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 4.7-magnitude aftershock sent jittery residents of foothill communities in 
San Bernardino and eastern Los Angeles counties ducking under desks and rushing 
for doorways Friday morning, but authorities said it caused little new damage. 
</P>
<P>
The sharp jolt at 9:26 a.m. triggered rockslides along mountain roads and 
stretched some cracks in walls and ceilings, but most of the damage appeared to 
be to already frayed nerves. 
</P>
<P>
"About four or five of us tried to get into the same doorway," said Michael 
Boddy, an official at the Claremont School of Theology, where staff members 
were just beginning to recover from the 5.5-magnitude temblor on Wednesday. 
"It's been a little hard to get our steam up." 
</P>
<P>
The aftershock caused a leak in a natural gas line at the University of La 
Verne, said Jeff Allred, La Verne's assistant city manager. Several water lines 
elsewhere in the city, a few miles from the epicenter, were also reported 
broken. 
</P>
<P>
In the most severely affected communities Friday, residents were still sweeping 
up glass and rubble and assessing losses from Wednesday's quake. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the state Office of Emergency Services said the agency was 
preliminarily estimating damages at $12.3 million. As of late Friday, 38 people 
had been reported injured, including four pregnant women who went into early 
labor, and 243 homes and 92 businesses had been reported damaged. 
</P>
<P>
At the theology school library Friday, a distraught John C. Trever got his 
first glimpse since Wednesday of his collection of ancient Middle Eastern 
pottery and artifacts, some of the pieces more than 3,000 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"It's worse than I thought," said Trever, a retired archeologist who was the 
first American allowed to examine the Dead Sea Scrolls, 2,000-year-old 
manuscripts unearthed more than 40 years ago in what was then Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
Shards of pottery were strewn along the floors of display cases. "It breaks my 
heart to see the collection in this condition," Trever said. He leaned close to 
a display case and smiled with relief. "I'm glad that wasn't broken," he said, 
pointing to a small flask. "It's a little dipper flask that was used in the 
time of Solomon." 
</P>
<P>
Also preserved was Trever's photographed copy of the Scroll of Isaiah, 
displayed in frames along one wall. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal building inspectors and structural engineers continued making their 
rounds Friday. In Claremont, 150 houses were reported damaged, but few so 
severely that closure was required, inspectors said. 
</P>
<P>
On the theology school campus, the Kresge Chapel, a towering structure with 
67-foot ceilings, has been sealed until engineers can check cracks between roof 
and walls. A portion of a building on the campus of the Claremont Graduate 
School was sealed off because a concrete panel on the second floor had slipped 
its anchoring. 
</P>
<P>
In the Lang Art Gallery on the campus of Scripps College, about 20% of a 
collection of modern ceramics was destroyed in the quake Wednesday. But the 
gallery is planning to open its annual ceramics exposition as scheduled this 
evening, said Steve Comba, registrar of galleries for the six Claremont 
Colleges. 
</P>
<P>
In the Honnold Library, which serves the six colleges, staff and volunteers 
were cleaning up Friday after the first quake knocked about 10% of the books 
onto the floor. Parts of the third and fourth floors were especially hard hit. 
Free-standing tiers of bookshelves stood precariously at drunken angles, and 
the aisles were knee-deep in books. 
</P>
<P>
In one four-square-block area of Pomona, three pre-1940 churches were blocked 
off. The original sanctuary of the First Baptist Church, on Holt Avenue, was 
sealed after cracks were detected in the bell tower and on the facade. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really not as bad as it looks," said Dennis Endert, church business 
manager. "A couple of blocks came loose and there's some damage to the bell 
tower." 
</P>
<P>
Down the street, parts of the Pilgrim Congregational Church also were sealed 
off, including the entrance to the Sunday school over which was perched a stone 
cross that had swiveled during Wednesday's quake. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to face north," structural engineer Michael Krakower said. "Now it's 
facing west." 
</P>
<P>
A block away, on Gibbs Street, members of the congregation of the Trinity 
United Methodist Church determined the property had sustained $50,000 in 
damages. On Wednesday, they said, bricks and heavy concrete cornices from the 
main building had tumbled onto an adjoining nursery, smashing a hole in its 
roof. No one was in the nursery at the time.

CHURCH AND STATE BATTLE OVER PAYING FOR CLEANUP OF TOXIC DUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD B. TAYLOR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cleanup costs for an illegal toxic waste dump discovered in the Century Freeway 
construction zone and near a Catholic school could run as high as $30 million, 
and the church may have to pay a share of the costs, state officials said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The levels of lead, copper and other heavy metals found in the dump near the 
St. Frances X. Cabrini Catholic Church and parish school exceed state health 
standards, California Department of Transportation engineers said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the site, located in South-Central Los Angeles, is on land that once 
belonged to the Catholic archdiocese, so state officials want the church to 
bear some cleanup costs. 
</P>
<P>
That bit of news angered the parish priest who has been fighting with Caltrans 
to get the state to haul away a mountain of dirt it has stored on the 
construction site. 
</P>
<P>
"They are trying to intimidate us by saying they'll put the onus of (toxic 
waste) removal on the church," said Father David O'Connell. "We didn't dump the 
toxins there . . . (but) if they want to go the legal route, we can go that way 
too." 
</P>
<P>
Fighting back, the priest called a press conference Friday to demand that the 
state remove the 150,000 cubic yards of dirt piled on the site and clean up the 
toxic wastes. He said the toxic wastes posed a health threat to children 
attending the parish school, a contention the state denied. 
</P>
<P>
A top Caltrans official countered by accusing the cleric of stirring up 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"He's trying to intimidate us," said Caltrans engineer Charles O'Connell, who 
is no relation to the priest. "This is classic social activism. He's called a 
press conference and invited in elected officials (to a community meeting 
Friday night) . . We're the lambs being led to slaughter." 
</P>
<P>
The dirt mountain and illegal toxic waste dump are on a large parcel of vacant 
land south of Imperial Highway, between Normandie and Western avenues, that was 
acquired by the state in the 1970s for the $2-billion Century Freeway project. 
</P>
<P>
The state stockpiled dirt for fill behind the church on two parcels acquired 
from the church and a private owner. But the dirt was not needed. 
</P>
<P>
A deep ravine that crosses the two parcels had apparently been used as 
unapproved trash dumping for decades, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Under current plans, the Century Freeway will cut through the dirt mountain and 
the old trash dump. Tests revealed that levels of the heavy metals in the dump 
exceed state safety standards, but are within the more tolerant safety limits 
set by the federal Environmental Protection Agency, state engineers said. 
</P>
<P>
Test borings revealed that the highest levels of lead -- 300 parts per million 
-- were found layered deep in the dump, but still were 100 feet above the water 
table, they reported. State safety standards are 5 p.p.m. The levels of copper, 
zinc and other heavy metals were also high, but well within federal safety 
limits, according to Caltrans engineer Paul In. 
</P>
<P>
He said the buried toxic wastes do not pose a health hazard where they are, but 
when they are dug up they will have to be removed to an approved hazardous 
waste dump. 
</P>
<P>
Father O'Connell said his church could not afford to help with the cleanup. 
"The church here is very poor," he said. "But if they want a fight on this, we 
will have to fight."Church and State Battle Over Paying for Cleanup of Toxic 
Dump

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : MAN STABBED TO DEATH BY NIGHTTIME INTRUDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Torrance man was stabbed to death shortly before dawn Friday as he struggled 
with an intruder in his home near the San Diego Freeway, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
California Highway Patrol officers arrested a Torrance resident in his 20s who 
was running along the freeway away from the crime scene, but authorities 
refused to identify the man Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We are satisfied that he is our suspect," said Torrance Police Sgt. Ronald 
Traber. 
</P>
<P>
William Smith, 39, who lived in the 3900 block of West 171st Street with his 
wife and daughter, died of multiple stab wounds at Little Company of Mary 
Hospital after the 5:30 a.m. attack. Smith's death was the first homicide of 
the year in Torrance, police said. There were seven homicides in the city in 
1989 and three in 1988.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : NEW PHONES SOUGHT IN BID TO CURB DRUG TRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to short-circuit the drug trade's telecommunications system, 
Compton officials this week launched a campaign to get pay telephones in places 
such as liquor stores, coin laundries and fast-food restaurants that are 
adjusted to block incoming calls. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers, according to police, hang around the businesses and take calls from 
customers on pay phones. 
</P>
<P>
"They use the phone booth like an office," Compton Police Cmdr. Terry Ebert 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Compton is not the first city to target pay phones. Similar steps have been 
taken in Long Beach, Venice and the West Adams area of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Compton officials say they will not try to take phones away from honest 
residents that need them. But, as Inglewood started doing last fall, Compton 
will contact business owners and ask them to work with phone companies to have 
incoming calls blocked.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : WOMAN IN BARRY CASE PLEADS NO CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The woman who helped the FBI arrest Washington Mayor Marion Barry on a 
crack-cocaine charge pleaded no contest Friday to a charge of driving under the 
influence of alcohol and was sentenced to three years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
Hazel Diane Moore, 38, who also uses the name Rasheeda Moore, was not present 
in Van Nuys Municipal Court when her attorney entered the plea. 
</P>
<P>
A second count of driving under the influence was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Court Commissioner Mitchell Block fined Moore $927 and ordered her to enroll in 
a court-approved alcohol education program. The commissioner also restricted 
her from driving anywhere but to and from work. Moore was arrested by Los 
Angeles police on New Year's Day in North Hollywood for driving with a 
blood-alcohol level of 0.12%, substantially above the new legal limit of 0.08%. 
Moore, a former model, lives in Burbank.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : FIFTH MEMBER NAMED TO RENT CONTROL BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The deadlock over the appointment of the fifth member to the Santa Monica Rent 
Control Board, which had threatened to indefinitely hamper board business, was 
broken Thursday night with the selection of Jay P. Johnson, 47, an apartment 
owner who supports rent control. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Eileen Lipson, who had sided with board member Dolores Press in 
the deadlock against board Chairwoman Susan Packer Davis and board member Wayne 
Bauer, said she swung her vote because she thinks Johnson is open-minded and "a 
person of great integrity." 
</P>
<P>
The board had been trying since Jan. 22 to agree on a replacement for Julie 
Lopez Dad, who resigned late last year. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's appointment comes at a time when the city's rent control ordinance, 
considered among the toughest in the nation, is under attack by landlords.

ELECTION: OFFICIALS KICK OFF THE CAMPAIGN FOR PROPOSITION 107, A $150-MILLION 
BOND MEASURE TO SHELTER THE HOMELESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Standing on the steps of a shabby Westlake District building that has been 
recaptured from drug dealers, State Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) on 
Friday launched a campaign for Proposition 107, the bond measure to provide 
funds for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti said the $150 million raised by the measure, if voters approve it in 
June, "will be pumped into" 4,000 new low-cost rental units, 13,000 shelter 
beds, assistance to 4,000 low-income, first-time home buyers and restoration of 
slum buildings like the one undergoing a face-lift in Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 107 is the final measure in a $600-million package of 
Roberti-sponsored bills to rehabilitate 22,000 rental units in California for 
low-income families. Voters in 1988 approved the first phase, also for $150 
million, under Proposition 77, and backed $300 million under Proposition 84. 
</P>
<P>
Tanya Tull, director of Beyond Shelter, a nonprofit group, said the 41-unit 
building on South Coronado Street would "still be under control of a slumlord 
and drug dealers" if not for $1.7 million provided by Proposition 77. 
</P>
<P>
The funds helped Beyond Shelter purchase the apartment building and launch 
modernization work to be completed this year. The total project will cost $3.4 
million and includes a playground, library and adult-education classroom on the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond Shelter has dubbed the ornate, 1920s building "Columbia House" to 
recognize a $360,000 grant from Columbia Savings Charitable Foundation. The 
city Community Redevelopment Agency provided $540,000 in loans, and the 
California Housing Finance Agency provided an $820,000 loan. 
</P>
<P>
"Forty-one families with more than 100 children will live here when we are 
done," said Tull, one of many housing advocates at Friday's kickoff. "We can 
take back slum housing and turn it into modern housing for families." 
</P>
<P>
Alcira Corcio, 34, a 12-year resident of the building, said she remembers when 
it "was so clean and so neat" several years ago. But an absentee landlord 
bought the structure, refused to make repairs and hired a succession of 
managers who allowed drug dealing and prostitution, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"By last fall it was really bad, with most units just empty because families 
were scared off," said Corcio, a mother of two boys. "One day we found three 
men kicking in the apartment doors along our third floor." 
</P>
<P>
The Corcios and 13 other tenant families will remain in the building during 
renovations and are assured low rents -- $312 to $570 a month -- in the 
spacious one-, two- and three-bedroom units. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign plans for the ballot initiative include a series of news conferences 
and appearances by dozens of Hollywood celebrities. Friday's kickoff of the 
statewide effort drew elected officials from Northern and Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell told the gathering that while local officials "are 
doing all they can" with limited funds, cities and counties must collectively 
begin demanding more state funding for low-cost housing. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally I would be saying good morning, but for 100,000 homeless people (in 
California), morning is just another end to a night on the streets," said Kell. 
</P>
<P>
National studies have shown that California has the worst shortage of 
affordable housing in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that, the California Coalition for Rural Housing, which monitors 
expenditures for housing nationwide, said California spends only 64 cents per 
capita on low-income housing, nationally ranking it near the bottom with the 
poorest Southern states. By contrast, Massachusetts spends $18 per capita.

She said she recently discovered two elderly women living in storage closets of 
an attic in a decaying building downtown. And last fall, she said, her agency

monthly take-home pay could not both feed his family and rent an apartment.

RADON LEVELS IN 2 WELLS NOT 'ASTOUNDING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By YOLANDA RODRIGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Radon, a colorless, odorless gas considered to be the second-greatest cause of 
lung cancer, has been found at two ground-water wells in San Diego County, but 
the levels are not "astounding," a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
The naturally occurring gas is released when uranium ore in the ground decays. 
When the ore is below a water table, the gas percolates through rock and 
dissolves in the water, then escapes when a faucet is opened. If a home is 
airtight, the gas accumulates, and particles of radon can become lodged in the 
lungs. 
</P>
<P>
It is prolonged exposure to radon that causes lung cancer, said Greg Helmes, an 
environmental specialist for the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
In a six-month study, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California 
tested 200 wells in Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Ventura, Orange and San Diego 
counties. Although the district supplies only surface water to its member 
agencies, the study was done on their behalf, said Jennifer Smith, a 
spokeswoman for the district. There are about 60 wells within the district's 
boundaries in San Diego County, she said, adding that most of the water drawn 
from the wells is used for irrigation. 
</P>
<P>
Maximum contamination levels have not been set by the EPA, but they are 
expected to be by the end of this year or early next year, Helmes said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the maximum level of radiation could be set as low as 200 picocuries 
per liter, or as high as 2,000 picocuries. (Radiation is measured in curies, or 
the amount of material undergoing radioactive decay in one second. A picocurie 
is one-trillionth of a curie.) One of the two wells tested is managed by the 
city of San Diego and is near Lakeside between the El Cajon and El Monte-Santee 
basins. It averaged 215 picocuries per liter. The other is in the Helix water 
district near the San Pasqual Basin in northeastern San Diego County and 
averaged 298 picocuries per liter. 
</P>
<P>
The risk of getting lung cancer after a lifetime of exposure at levels between 
200 and 500 picocuries per liter is one in 10,000, Helmes said. 
</P>
<P>
The levels found in San Diego County are "not astounding. I mean, it's not 
something to make you run out of the house or anything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Radon ranks second only to smoking as a cause of lung cancer. It largely 
dissipates when it comes in contact with air.

JUDGE ORDERS CITY TO RELEASE BRADLEY REELECTION DOCUMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH CONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge Friday ordered city officials to release boxes of 
detailed financial records on Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley's 1989 reelection 
campaign, but postponed a decision on whether to release other documents that 
have been referred to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
City officials had denied a Los Angeles Times request to inspect the records, 
which are being audited by Los Angeles City Clerk Elias Martinez. The request 
was made late last year when the paper reported that a series of inner-city 
campaign carnivals, organized by Bradley supporters, may have violated state 
and local campaign reporting laws. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, The Times asked the court to order the release of the records. 
</P>
<P>
Judge David P. Yaffe on Friday ruled that 23 boxes of campaign documents held 
by the city clerk must be opened to inspection. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's office argued unsuccessfully that the records were not 
public because they were only temporarily in the custody of city auditors. 
</P>
<P>
Times attorney Glen A. Smith argued that the city clerk's office had the 
documents as part of its official, legally required duties, which makes them 
public under state law. Yaffe agreed with the Times, but said the order would 
not become final for 15 days to allow objections to be filed. 
</P>
<P>
Yaffe also tentatively indicated he would order the release of 47 Bradley 
campaign documents related to the carnivals that have been referred to the Los 
Angeles County district attorney's office and the state Fair Political 
Practices Commission for investigation. But Yaffe agreed to review those 
documents privately next week before ruling on their release. Deputy City Atty. 
Linda Lefkowitz argued that the records are exempt from disclosure because they 
are the focus of an audit and investigation that "could lead to action by more 
than one . . . law enforcement agency." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, The Times reported that the material turned over to the district 
attorney's office included copies of about $80,000 worth of money orders 
generated by the carnival and apparently delivered directly to the mayor. Also 
included were handwritten notes that the mayor sent to his campaign accountant 
indicating how to report the contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has said he relied on campaign accountants and lawyers to determine how 
the carnival proceeds should be reported. His office declined to comment Friday 
on Yaffe's ruling.

MARINE WAITS FOR BIRTHDAY TO CLAIM HIS LOTTO JACKPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Marine from Carlsbad waited until his birthday to come forward Friday and 
claim his share of last Saturday's $6.3-million Lotto jackpot, Lotto officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gunnery Sgt. William Bartsch, stationed at Camp Pendleton, submitted his claim 
Friday morning and will receive the first installment of a $3,186,409 payout 
several weeks from now, said a California State Lottery spokesman. Bartsch was 
one of two people who correctly picked six winning numbers for the Feb. 24 
drawing. The other winner was from Eureka. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't want any publicity," the spokesman said. "It's all confidential, and 
he won't release anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Bartsch, who waited nearly a week to collect his winnings, was in "full 
military uniform when he came in" to claim his prize, said Bruce Cherubin of 
the lottery. 
</P>
<P>
Bon Nguyen, 28, of San Diego, also became a lottery millionaire, picking five 
numbers and the bonus number from Wednesday's drawing. Nguyen's ticket was 
worth $1,055,539.20. 
</P>
<P>
Dee Arabo, who, along with her father, Kamil, runs the Fiesta Liquor and Deli 
in Carlsbad that sold the winning ticket, said Bartsch knew right after the 
Saturday drawing that he had won. 
</P>
<P>
"Saturday night, right after the drawing on TV, he called. And then he came in 
to just double-check the numbers that had come out and tell us he had won," 
Arabo said. "He was waiting for his birthday to claim his prize, and his 
birthday is today. He turned 44 today." 
</P>
<P>
Arabo said Bartsch is going through a divorce and needed time to consult with 
his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess he didn't want his wife to know or something," Arabo said, "but I'm 
sure she knows by now." 
</P>
<P>
After taxes, Bartsch will get $128,256 a year for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Arabo said Bartsch had been buying $5 to $10 worth of Lotto tickets from the 
store, in the 2700 block of State Street, for every drawing over the last three 
years, always using the same numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Bartsch did not say what he intended to do with the money. 
</P>
<P>
Arabo's store will receive almost $16,000 for selling the winning ticket.

CARLSBAD THEATER WON'T BE RAZED; OWNERS VIEW MOVIE HOUSE OPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY TESSLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The owners of the vaudeville-era Carlsbad Theater indicated this week that they 
have dropped plans to demolish the 63-year-old building and are negotiating to 
reopen it as a movie house showing classic films. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish-style landmark was closed 18 months ago when the city fire marshal 
declared it a hazard and insisted that safety measures must be completed before 
stage productions could continue. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, owners Raymond and Celestine Normandin, represented by their son 
Paul Normandin, said they would raze the historic theater unless the city 
either bought it or helped pay for renovations. 
</P>
<P>
A consultant's report said it would cost $2.6 million to make the 1927 theater 
stronger in case of earthquake, restore the original front and interior, add 
new lighting and sound systems and install a heating-cooling system. 
</P>
<P>
The Normandins threatened to seek a city demolition permit, believing that 
state law required all unreinforced masonry buildings like theirs to be 
strengthened by next year. The family argued that they couldn't afford such 
expensive earthquake renovation and would lose their liability insurance on the 
property if they didn't comply with the law. 
</P>
<P>
However, Community Development Director Marty Orenyak has informed the 
Normandins that they misunderstood the law, which requires that old, 
unreinforced buildings simply be identified. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to emphasize that, until the state or city adopts additional 
legislation, no seismic retrofit requirement is necessary for your building," 
according to Orenyak. 
</P>
<P>
Normandin met with city officials Wednesday and said afterward that his family 
is no longer considering knocking down the theater after learning the seismic 
renovation isn't required by next year. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we've got the earthquake problem solved," said Normandin. 
</P>
<P>
He said Michael Markie, his real-estate agent, is negotiating with an 
unidentified but "experienced" tenant interested in reopening the theater and 
showing classic films, perhaps including some silent movies. 
</P>
<P>
Normandin hopes the films will revive interest in the Carlsbad Theater. 
</P>
<P>
"People can get a sense of the theater's history. It's a time capsule of 60 
years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He hopes that its reopening will spur the community to consider supporting more 
extensive use of the theater and inspire creating an organization to raise 
money for renovation. 
</P>
<P>
But first, Normandin must satisfy city building and fire officials that the 
theater is safe. Measures to bring it up to code were the main topic of 
Wednesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Orenyak said after the meeting that it would take minimal improvements for the 
theater to reopen soon as a movie house. However, he said it could cost $10,000 
to $20,000 to make it suitable for stage productions. 
</P>
<P>
"We told him today exactly what we told him 2 1/2 years ago" what it would take 
to make the structure fire safe, said Orenyak. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city staff this week released an executive summary to the 
earlier renovation report, and it reflected little enthusiasm for spending city 
funds on theater renovation. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that Carlsbad already has a Cultural Arts Center, the summary said city 
participation in fixing up the Carlsbad Theater "may be premature or 
undesirable." 
</P>
<P>
It advised that the Normandins should consider hiring its own consultant to 
explore uses for the theater, "along with potential private funding sources," 
before a decision to renovate the theater is made.

ANNENBERG TO GIVE $50 MILLION TO BLACK SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the largest single donation ever to black higher education in the United 
States, publishing magnate Walter H. Annenberg said Friday that he has pledged 
$50 million to the United Negro College Fund. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless young blacks are brought into the mainstream of economic life, they 
will continue to be on the curbstone," Annenberg, the 82-year-old former 
ambassador to Great Britain, said in a telephone interview from his Rancho 
Mirage estate. "The key to this problem is education." 
</P>
<P>
The gift was to be announced formally on Sunday by President Bush during his 
weekend stay at the Annenberg estate, where he and Japanese Prime Minister 
Toshiki Kaifu are holding economic and trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
Annenberg said his gift will be a challenge grant to form the basis of what the 
UNCF hopes will be a $250-million capital campaign. He said he would be giving 
the money in phases during "the next five or 10 years," as the fund reaches 
step-by-step goals toward the other $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Black colleges have got to be supported," Annenberg added, urging that his 
challenge grant be matched from other sources. "The entire country has to get 
behind this. Foundations, corporations and private citizens. We can't just 
leave this for the government to do." 
</P>
<P>
The Annenberg grant tops the previous largest gift to any black-oriented school 
or educational program -- the $20 million given by actor Bill Cosby in 
November, 1988, to Spelman College in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
And the gift comes at a crucial time for the fund, which aids 41 historically 
black colleges throughout the nation and gives scholarships to deserving 
students. The declining enrollment of black students, particularly black males, 
at all American colleges in the past decade has caused much alarm. In addition, 
the financial condition of some black colleges, including many small 
institutions in the South, has become precarious. 
</P>
<P>
"Words cannot do justice to my feelings of gratitude," Christopher Edley, 
president of the fund, said in a statement prepared for Sunday's ceremony, 
according to the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
Annenberg, the former owner of TV Guide and other publications, has been one of 
the nation's strongest supporters of higher education. His $3-million gift to 
USC brought his total donations to the college's recent fund-raising drive to 
$26.5 million and put the university over the top in its $567-million fund 
drive. The USC School of Communications bears the Annenberg name, as does a 
similar school at the University of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
The United Negro College Fund was established in 1944 and has since raised more 
than $650 million for its members. The fund estimates that the average 
endowment of its institutions was $6,710 per student in 1987 compared to an 
average of $19,918 per student at primarily white institutions. 
</P>
<P>
While the Annenberg pledge is enormous, it is not the largest in general higher 
education. That spot is held by Robert W. Woodruff, former chairman of the 
Coca-Cola Co., who gave $105 million to Emory University in Atlanta in 1979. In 
1986, David Packard, co-founder of the Hewlett-Packard Co. electronics firm, 
pledged $70 million to Stanford University and his partner, William Hewlett, 
gave $50 million to the university. 
</P>
<P>
Annenberg served as ambassador to Great Britain from 1969 to 1974. He joined 
his father's company, Triangle Publications, in 1928 and developed it into a 
successful publishing firm. He founded Seventeen and TV Guide magazines and in 
1957 bought the Philadelphia Daily News. His father's firm had previously 
acquired the Philadelphia Inquirer. In 1988, he sold Triangle Publications Inc. 
to Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. for $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Annenberg said Friday he was particularly alarmed at the rise of gangs among 
black youths in the nation's cities. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you want the gangs you have in Los Angeles to continue endlessly? Maybe 
this will be the start of the end of that," he said, referring to the increased 
scholarships and college recruiting that his money will help buy.

ACADEMICS DEBATE THE DECLINE OF OLD-GUARD COMMUNISM IN EASTERN EUROPE. HAS 
SOCIALISM BEEN DEFEATED OR REINVIGORATED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Economics professor Richard Wolff expected 150 academics to attend a scholarly 
conference entitled "Rethinking Marxism." Instead, about 1,500 showed up at the 
meeting at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, straining hotels, 
restaurants and auditoriums. 
</P>
<P>
When Wolff began planning the event in the fall of 1988, Stalinist regimes 
controlled Eastern Europe and perestroika was in its early stages in the Soviet 
Union. But by the time the meeting took place several months ago, the world had 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
According to Wolff and other leftist scholars, the huge turnout proves that 
there is more interest than ever in Marxism among U.S. academics -- despite 
claims to the contrary by their conservative counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
The upheaval in the communist world "has made many more Americans who are 
interested in Marxism feel much more comfortable about saying so," said Wolff, 
who conceded that some people may find that ironic. "When this Cold War stuff 
ebbs and cracks and breaks down, we can openly debate and explain without a 
shadow." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond any political debate, the events in Eastern Europe have sparked 
intellectual turmoil on American college campuses. There is a nervous rush to 
update textbooks made obsolete by daily headlines. Yet there is excitement 
about new research opportunities, and there is professorial pleasure that 
students are becoming more passionate about history, economics and human 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative scholars are gloating over the West's supposed victory in the Cold 
War and predict a steep decline in the study of Marxism. And socialist 
professors are saying the changes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union have 
freed them from perceived ties with the abuses of Stalinism while depriving 
conservatives of their anti-Soviet intellectual anchor. 
</P>
<P>
Wolff and other like-minded professors maintain that the overthrown leaders in 
Eastern Europe enforced repressive policies that perverted true socialism. 
</P>
<P>
"The slogan I came up with is: 'Socialism is dead. Long live Socialism,' " said 
Anatole Anton, a professor at San Francisco State University who teaches 
Marxist philosophy and describes himself as a democratic socialist. "The old 
model of statist, authoritarian socialism really has been dealt a death blow. 
That sweeps the slate clean and asks intellectuals to think about the meaning 
of democratic socialism." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Anton and others say, few on the left had kept faith with the 
pre-glasnost communist systems. 
</P>
<P>
It is wrong, Anton said, for conservatives to assume that American-style 
capitalism will suddenly blossom in places such as Romania and Bulgaria. 
Rather, he predicted, nations whose governments have been overthrown will look 
to such countries as Sweden -- with its mixture of state planning, private 
enterprise and social welfare benefits -- as models. 
</P>
<P>
At Columbia University, undergraduates are asking history professor Martha 
Howell about whether socialism is indeed in its death throes. But Howell, who 
is chairwoman of the Radical History Review, a publication that often 
interprets history from a Marxist point of view, tells them that the toppled 
Stalinist regimes in Eastern Europe gave socialism a black eye. 
</P>
<P>
"What you want to do is get students in the class to think about how socialist 
states, as they existed post-war, failed to deliver the democracy as promised 
by the theorists. I think anybody who has worked in the history naturally makes 
those distinctions. But the average student doesn't," Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the political spectrum in academia, conservative scholars 
insist that their long-held beliefs have proven true: that now-toppled Eastern 
European governments never had popular support and that the American military 
buildup under the Reagan Administration encouraged the changes. Marxism, they 
say, is challenged in each day's headlines, and teaching about it faces a grim 
future in American higher education. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is that we hard-liners have been right all along," said Richard 
Pipes, history professor at Harvard University and former director of East 
European and Soviet affairs for the National Security Council in the Reagan 
Administration. "I think we have been completely vindicated." Only the speed of 
the changes in Eastern Europe surprised him, Pipes said. 
</P>
<P>
Pipes and others predict a resulting decline in student interest in Marxism in 
the United States, although they believe that interest in the Soviet Union and 
Eastern Europe will continue to mushroom. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen H. Balch -- president of the National Association of Scholars, an 
organization with conservative ties -- believes that a new generation of 
scholars will shun socialism. "They will start to learn the lessons of the 
world and will show more of an unwillingness to naively imbibe all that stuff," 
said Balch, an associate professor of government at John Jay College of 
Criminal Justice in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Students, he said, will become more interested in the nuts and bolts of making 
economies and governments work. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how they are going to cope," Pipes said of the intellectual left, 
dismissing its claims of rejuvenation. 
</P>
<P>
But their opponents argue that it will be the conservatives who have trouble 
coping. They say the self-congratulation among conservative scholars masks a 
deeper insecurity. The theory that the Soviet system was inflexible -- as made 
famous by former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Jeane J. Kirkpatrick -- 
has proven false, the liberal scholars insist. 
</P>
<P>
"Fear of the Soviet Union has been the basis of conservative power and thought 
in America since about 1948. Or I should say manipulation of fear of 
communism," said Jon Wiener, history professor at UC Irvine. "What will hold 
conservatism together now that conservatives have really lost the bedrock of 
their interpretation?" 
</P>
<P>
Whatever their political persuasion, however, scholars in Soviet and Eastern 
European studies are tossing old assumptions into the dustbin of academia. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a tremendous upheaval," said Richard Lyman, former president of Stanford 
University, who is now director of its Institute for International Studies. "A 
whole lot of stuff written even recently has to be read with a red pencil on 
every page. I think it's a very big problem for everybody teaching in relevant 
areas." 
</P>
<P>
The result has been a rush to update textbooks to reflect the revolutions in 
the Soviet bloc. 
</P>
<P>
"Textbooks are very far behind," said Christopher S. Allen, assistant professor 
of political science at the University of Georgia at Athens. He and his 
co-authors are updating a book on European politics but worry that the 
revisions will be out of date by publication. Allen and several professors 
across the country report that they have stopped using certain texts and are 
requiring students to read foreign-affairs coverage in daily newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Much past scholarship concentrated on power struggles within communist parties 
and on centralized economic planning within the communist system. Now, scholars 
say, there is a flurry of interest in the lesser-known aspects of Soviet and 
Eastern European life -- churches, unions, underground economies, pre-World War 
II political parties and ethnic minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Glasnost will help, everyone agrees, by opening to Western researchers an 
enormous amount of previously suppressed information about the Soviet system. 
</P>
<P>
"The material coming out now is very exciting indeed," said Robert Conquest, a 
senior research fellow in Soviet history and international affairs at the 
Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace at Stanford. He likened some 
past scholarship about the Soviet Union to writing about ancient Roman history 
by contemplating ruins and reading a few memoirs. 
</P>
<P>
With the situation so much in flux, many scholars are reluctant to predict what 
might happen in Eastern Europe, said Conquest, who is working on a new edition 
of his book about Stalinist terrors. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody asked me: 'Will Gorbachev win the political struggle?' And I said, 
'Look, at 10 o'clock in the morning on the day of the battle you couldn't 
predict the outcome of . . . Waterloo.' " Gorbachev's policies, according to 
Conquest, are "that of a guy going down the Grand Canyon in a canoe. He doesn't 
want to sink." 
</P>
<P>
William Tabb, economics and sociology professor at Queens College in New York, 
said one of the hardest tasks will be deciding what is worthwhile to save from 
past research. On the right, the idea is discredited that the Soviet system is 
incapable of change, he said. But so is leftist ideology that the now-toppled 
communist governments in Eastern Europe were evolving toward democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"So much of what was written was so off base," Tabb said. "The presumptions, 
the assumptions were so far off the mark." 
</P>
<P>
But despite the turmoil, there is exhilaration that students want to delve more 
deeply into the dramatic changes. 
</P>
<P>
"This provides a wonderful opportunity in the classroom to examine 20th-Century 
history and the complexity of politics," said Howell of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
Professors across the nation report significant increases in student enrollment 
in classes dealing with the Eastern Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I've suddenly improved as a teacher," Andrei S. Markovits, 
political science professor at Boston University, remarked about the more 
crowded classrooms. "There is just an awareness that this is a momentous time." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Caldwell, a Soviet affairs expert who teaches political science at 
Occidental College, described his students as "irrepressible" in their urge to 
discuss current events, even when the day's lecture is about medieval Russian 
history. 
</P>
<P>
"The challenge for me is how to get students to look at the longer-term trends 
and the broader picture when their interest is so consumed by the headlines," 
Caldwell said. "And I don't mean that critically because the headlines are so 
interesting." 
</P>
<P>
At USC, international relations professor Steven Lamy also said that student 
excitement must be channeled into more than celebration about the end of the 
Cold War. "Most students are running around like we just won the Rose Bowl," 
Lamy said, referring to campus reaction to the toppling of the Berlin Wall. He 
said he now wants students to focus on the many economic and environmental 
problems that remain worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Madeleine Albright, international relations professor at Georgetown University, 
said she is urging students to "free themselves from old thinking" -- to be 
wary of scholars with vested interests. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard even for students between 18 and 22 to take a leap and think about 
the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe being different. They are nervous about 
treading new ground," she said. "So I tell them I don't have the answers and 
that I am exploring new ground with them."

BEST WEAPON IN DRUG WAR MAY BE MAN'S BEST FRIEND

<P>
When Los Angeles police officer Don Leahan first spotted him, Frog was just 
another face behind bars, a mongrel with an attitude and a reputation for 
chewing couches. Leahan at once saw Frog's potential. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw that playfulness in him," Leahan said, "and I thought to myself, 'Now he 
will make a good dope dog."' 
</P>
<P>
Frog would become legendary as one of the nation's first and most effective 
narcotics-sniffing dogs. In eight years until his death in June, 1986, he 
ferreted out more than $155 million worth of heroin, cocaine and marijuana 
hidden in radios, false suitcase bottoms, cargo containers, cars and planes. He 
was challenged in court, cursed and threatened. 
</P>
<P>
And through it all, Leahan said, "all you had to do was pat him on the head and 
give him a toy. He was ready to go again." 
</P>
<P>
In the nation's multibillion-dollar war on drugs, it seems that nothing can 
beat the nose of a good dog. In the last decade, employment of the dogs has 
escalated from a novelty to a necessity for most law enforcement agencies. 
Police swear by them, smugglers fear them and judges tend to view them as one 
of the few parties in court whose objectivity is beyond reproach. 
</P>
<P>
Narcotics-sniffing dogs represent a bargain in a drug war being waged with 
$18-million radar blimps and command centers jammed with sophisticated 
electronic gear. They also tend to be less susceptible to bribes and similar 
scandals. 
</P>
<P>
"You have helicopters for surveillance and radios and patrol cars and 
investigators. But there is nothing you can rely on that will not break down or 
give you false leads . . . as a well-trained dog and handler," said Capt. Tim 
Simon, head of a multiagency regional drug task force in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials say the dogs have become so effective that smugglers 
have put bounties on their heads to permanently sideline them. And although no 
attempted "hits" have been reported against dogs in the United States, 
officials say the idea is not so far-fetched. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, 23 drug-sniffing dogs -- bought and trained with U.S. Narcotics 
Assistance Unit funds and sent to work the Bogota, Colombia, airport -- were 
killed by poison in their cages by suspected traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
Along the heavy drug-trafficking corridor of south Texas, narcotics smugglers 
are said by the U.S. Border Patrol to have offered $30,000 to anyone who kills 
Barco or Rocky, two of the agency's most effective dogs. Barco, an 
Airedale-Belgian malinois mix, has recorded more than $180 million in drug 
seizures at the small checkpoint of Falfurrias, Tex., just up the road from the 
Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
Last September, it was the dark, moist snout of the Monrovia police 
department's Dandy, a German shepherd, that helped police find and seize 20 
tons of cocaine in Sylmar valued at more than $6 billion -- the largest 
narcotics haul ever in the United States. His reaction to the warehouse 
persuaded a judge to issue a warrant for the place to be raided. 
</P>
<P>
Winston, a yellow Labrador working for the Orange County Sheriff's Department, 
was instrumental in the seizure of more than $5.2 million -- the second-largest 
cash seizure ever -- in suspected drug profits. Dogs have been known to "alert" 
-- pointing their noses or scratching at places where drugs are hidden -- to as 
little as one marijuana seed or somebody's drug-tainted breath. 
</P>
<P>
Although dogs have been used in police work for years, primarily for patrol 
duty, their use as narco-noses didn't gain widespread acceptance until about 10 
years ago. Drugs were being illegally smuggled into the United States in record 
amounts, and police needed another tool to help them combat traffickers. U.S. 
Customs, which pioneered the use of narcotics dogs in 1974, was looked to as a 
model. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, hundreds of dogs have been trained and deployed throughout the 
United States, and increasing numbers of other countries -- Saudi Arabia, 
Singapore and Mexico among them -- have also adopted dog programs. 
</P>
<P>
The dogs are trained to search for odors associated with various narcotics and 
then rewarded, often with nothing more than a tug on a towel or playing fetch 
with a rubber ball, when they "alert" to the presence of the drug. Police 
officials say concealed drugs that would take a team of officers hours, if not 
days, to locate, can be tracked down by a dog in only minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Leahan recalled that Frog, a pit-bull mix, once signaled a "hit" on a large 
radio carried by a passenger at Los Angeles International Airport, but despite 
a long search, police could find nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked everywhere," Leahan said, "and we kept coming up empty-handed. We 
turned on the radio and it played, so we assumed the batteries were OK. But 
Frog kept alerting to the radio. When we were about to give up, we found the 
radio was rigged to some kind of hearing-aid battery and the batteries we were 
looking at were filled with cocaine." 
</P>
<P>
Barco, the legendary Border Patrol canine, has uncovered shipments of marijuana 
and cocaine hidden in frozen fish, okra, garlic and onions, and once found 
several hundred pounds of cocaine sealed in airtight containers and floating in 
a truck's gas tank. 
</P>
<P>
Winston used his nose to lead Orange County officers to $2.8 million in 
drug-tainted cash and almost 4,000 pounds of cocaine, hidden in cedar chests 
and covered with mothballs. The Mississippi Highway Patrol's chocolate 
Labrador, Coco, is touted for his ability to sniff the scent of drugs in a car 
parked with 5,000 others in an airport parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Judges have shown respect for the canines' capabilities. Often they will issue 
a search warrant when the scent of a narcotic is apparent to a dog but not 
investigators. Courts have consistently upheld the use of narcotics dogs in 
drug arrests, and in some cases have held them to be beyond reproach. 
</P>
<P>
When defense attorneys questioned the judgment of a narcotics dog in an Orange 
County case two years ago, Harbor Municipal Judge Selim H. Franklin remarked 
that the dog "has more credibility with me than most of the witnesses who have 
appeared before me." Not surprisingly, the dog, Winston, has more than $70 
million in drug seizures to his credit. 
</P>
<P>
A dog's keen ability to detect and distinguish among various scents is 
legendary, but experts disagree on exactly how much better a dog can smell than 
a human. One thing seems certain, however: there is nothing, be it talcum 
powder, coffee, onions, diesel fuel or Ben-Gay, that can stifle the smell of 
narcotics for a trained dog. 
</P>
<P>
"When we walk into a room and smell chili," said Mark Walters, an Azusa police 
officer whose German shepherd, Kai, has netted more than $2 million worth of 
drugs in a year, "the dog is smelling the 25 or 30 ingredients that went into 
making that chili. It is an incredible ability." 
</P>
<P>
Experts say the traffickers have come up with nothing that can mask the smell 
of narcotics from dogs. In New York, Customs has reported two cases where 
canines in the "small dog" program -- these dogs sniff arriving international 
flight passengers -- correctly alerted to people who had swallowed cocaine 
stuffed in condoms. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people have used figures that the dog's sense of smell is a million times 
better than a human's," said Charles L. Truax, Los Angeles District K-9 
supervisor for the Customs Service. "I don't know what it is but we have never 
been able to develop any kind of electronic or man-made device that can equal a 
dog." 
</P>
<P>
Truax said that in fiscal year 1989 alone, Customs' 80 dogs across the country 
were responsible for uncovering almost $800 million in illegal narcotics -- 
representing roughly 10% of the total seizures. In Miami alone, Customs dogs 
helped uncover $249 million in drugs last year. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials say the costs associated with dog programs are minimal given 
the payoff. 
</P>
<P>
Buying and training a dog in narcotics detection costs between $3,000 to 
$10,000, but after the initial expenditures there is little more than food and 
veterinary care. 
</P>
<P>
The cost compares favorably to that of the high-tech gadgetry employed in the 
drug war. For example, the much-heralded Aerostat blimps that tether at 10,000 
feet and scan the U.S.-Mexican border with radar, looking for drug-smuggling 
aircraft, cost as much as $18 million each and $400 to $700 an hour to keep in 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
For fiscal 1989, Customs officials said, the five blimps covering the border 
from California to Brownsville, Tex., helped lead to the seizures of $774,000 
in cash, 106,000 pounds of marijuana and 65,900 pounds of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of good dogs deployed in the right area can do that themselves at a 
fraction of the costs," said Simon, director of the Orange County Regional 
Narcotics Suppression Program. "You can have your fancy electronics; I'll take 
Winston." 
</P>
<P>
But as the popularity of canines has increased -- today hundreds of law 
enforcement agencies have them across the nation -- so has the sophistication 
level of their training and breeding. Like Customs officials, the LAPD's Leahan 
started off scouting for his dogs at animal shelters, looking for "just the 
right combination of playfulness and aggressiveness. Not aggressive as in mean, 
but as in the dog will do anything to find the dope." 
</P>
<P>
Other police departments have relied on a small cottage industry of 
professional dog-training centers that import their dogs from Europe, complete 
with pedigree papers and trained to heed commands in three languages. 
</P>
<P>
The difference in approach has led to a lively, if good-natured, debate over 
dogs and their inherent abilities to be trained, about poodles versus shepherds 
and the need for private handlers to import and train the animals. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I think that blueblood stuff is just bull," Leahan said. "If you walked 
in with a skinny black-and-white dog, nobody would give you $10,000 for it, but 
he might make a hell of a dope dog. 
</P>
<P>
"Frog was like that. He didn't have a particularly good nose but he had a great 
attitude. I'd rather have a loyal employee with an IQ of 65 than a genius who 
didn't give a damn. Frog never could understand why three kilos of cocaine 
couldn't squeeze through a wall socket. He was kind of a bonehead, but very 
effective." 
</P>
<P>
Leahan said any dog with good retrieval instincts and a good nose -- "anything 
but those dogs with the smashed-up noses" -- are candidates for narcotics dogs, 
though most police agencies concede there is a prejudice against smaller dogs 
that don't fit the public's perception of a police dog. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not going to take a cocker spaniel and march him around with a macho 
cop. It just wouldn't look right," said Don Lambert, an Orange County Sheriff's 
investigator and Winston's handler. 
</P>
<P>
Customs does use beagles in its agriculture inspection program, and smaller 
dogs are utilized to search for drugs in confined places like airplanes and 
boats. But the dogs of choice, both for narcotics work and the more common 
patrol K-9, are the Belgian malinois, the Labrador retriever and the German 
shepherd. 
</P>
<P>
Outside of breeding, the competition among police agencies to boast of having 
"top dog" is equally intense. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Garcia, assistant chief of the McAllen, Tex., Border Patrol sector, 
considers Barco the most famous of America's drug-sniffing canines. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been on the cover of Dog World, and you know he's in the Guinness Book of 
World Records, the 1990 edition now available (in bookstores). That would be on 
page 46," Garcia said with unabashed pride. Other Border Patrol agents, Garcia 
said, refer to Barco as "the John Wayne of drug dogs." 
</P>
<P>
Leahan said "the most famous dog I knew was Frog," and while Frog had no 
pedigree and was at the pound when discovered, he could go nose-to-nose with 
any Border Patrol canine. 
</P>
<P>
And from Orange County, Simon countered that if Barco is John Wayne, Winston is 
"the John Houseman of dogs. He established a reputation the old-fashioned way 
-- he earned it."

An appeals court Friday returned to Dr. Elizabeth Morgan the passport it had 
seized 3 1/2 years ago, allowing her to travel to New Zealand to participate in 
an international custody fight for her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
The District of Columbia Court of Appeals turned over the passport to Morgan a 
day after a lower court judge, who had jailed Morgan for more than two years 
for contempt of court, ruled that releasing the passport "is in the best 
interests of the minor child." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan, a plastic surgeon, was not available for comment. Her attorney, Adrian 
Roe, refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
But Morgan had said earlier that, if her passport were returned, she would 
immediately travel to Christchurch, New Zealand, for the next phase of a 
custody fight for her daughter, Hilary, 7. 
</P>
<P>
Hilary's father, Eric Foretich, 47, a Virginia oral surgeon, is already in New 
Zealand trying to gain custody of the child. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan, 42, contends that Foretich sexually abused Hilary, a charge he has 
repeatedly denied. 
</P>
<P>
Hilary surfaced last week in New Zealand, where she has been living in 
Christchurch since 1988 with her maternal grandparents, William and Antonia 
Morgan.

TRAVELERS STRANDED AS GREYHOUND DRIVERS STRIKE; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: 80% OF THE NATIONWIDE BUS SYSTEM SHUTS DOWN. REPLACEMENT 
WORKERS ARE BEING HIRED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands of passengers across the United States were stranded Friday as 
Greyhound Lines Inc.'s drivers went on strike after their contract expired, 
shutting down at least 80% of the country's only nationwide bus system. 
</P>
<P>
Greyhound executives, who spent the past two weeks recruiting strikebreakers, 
said they were servicing main routes with replacement drivers and would "make 
every attempt" to fully rebuild the system by the month's end as more new 
drivers were added. 
</P>
<P>
A company spokeswoman said 20% of the buses were in service Friday, manned by 
700 new drivers. But she declined to predict if that figure will grow over the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The Dallas-based company carried 22 million passengers last year, an average of 
about 60,000 a day. It is particularly crucial to low-income travelers who live 
in smaller communities. Greyhound is the only intercity transportation in 9,000 
of its 9,500 destinations, and half of its ridership comes from homes where the 
annual income is less than $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
Scattered strike-related violence was reported around the nation, with the most 
serious being a sniping incident in Chicago Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
United Press International reported that a sniper shot out windows of a 
Greyhound bus traveling on a Chicago highway, injuring passengers. Police said 
it was unclear if the incident was related to the labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions, which represents the 
company's 6,300 drivers and 3,075 office and maintenance workers in 19 local 
unions, ordered its members to strike at 11 p.m. PST Thursday when a three-year 
contract expired. 
</P>
<P>
The union accused Greyhound of bad-faith bargaining for refusing to modify an 
initial three-year contract offer that had been solidly rejected by a 
rank-and-file vote. The company accused drivers, who now average $24,700 a 
year, of asking for wage hikes that could be financed only through a fare 
increase. Each side accused the other of distorting its positions. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations, which had continued through the week and were augmented by a 
federal mediator Thursday night, ceased when the strike began. 
</P>
<P>
The work stoppage pits two legacies of the 1980s that are clashing increasingly 
in contemporary collective bargaining: a new owner who borrowed heavily to buy 
the company and is now burdened by large debt payments, and a union that made 
substantial wage concessions in two past contracts and now wants to reclaim 
much of what it gave up. 
</P>
<P>
All of this was lost on passengers with more immediate concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't tell me anything about this when I called," complained Dorothy 
Fullilove, who spent $10 on a cab ride from her sister's home to Greyhound's 
downtown Los Angeles bus station, only to find that her bus home to Indio, 
Calif., had been canceled. 
</P>
<P>
Scores of ticket-holding passengers slumped in seats or slept on the floor of 
the downtown terminal, advised by the public address system that trips would be 
scheduled as drivers became available. Television monitors that normally show 
departure times were turned off. Fifty people stood in line to buy tickets, 
serviced by only two clerks. 
</P>
<P>
Only four buses pulled into the station during a two-hour period where 30 would 
normally arrive. Greyhound's maintenance yard, a few blocks away from the 
terminal, was jammed with unused buses. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what to do," said Hortensia Torres of Palmdale, whose daughter 
had dropped her off at Greyhound's Hollywood station, unaware that the 
morning's bus to Oxnard -- like all other morning rides -- was canceled because 
of a lack of replacement drivers. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the nation, similar moans were audible. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Wilkins, 22, from London, was trying to get from Minneapolis to Memphis 
when the labor dispute intruded. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to see Elvis," he said, alluding to Elvis Presley's 
home-cum-museum. "I come to bloody America and they're on strike." 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Kois, a senior at West Virginia University in Morgantown, W. Va., was 
trying to get to Bozeman, Mont., for a job interview when the Greyhound ticket 
agent asked her: "Don't you read the papers?" She solved her problem by 
reserving a seat on a Montana-bound Amtrak train. Amtrak said it had advised 
its agents to honor Greyhound tickets when buses were unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
Greyhound was last struck by drivers in 1983 for seven weeks in a dispute that 
completely shut down the system for the first two weeks. At the time the 
company was owned by Greyhound Corp., a diversified conglomerate with the 
financial resources to absorb a long strike. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987 the parent corporation sold the bus business to a Texas investor group 
led by Fred G. Currey, who subsequently bought Greyhound's remaining national 
competitor, Trailways Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Both bus companies were a shambles. Falling fares on deregulated airlines had 
drastically cut bus ridership. The best deal drivers could get when they 
settled their strike in 1983 was a 7.8% pay cut over three years. In 1987 the 
union agreed to even sharper cuts -- 23% over three years. Those concessions 
allowed Currey to slash fares and attract more business. 
</P>
<P>
After losing $17 million in 1988, Greyhound finally made a small profit of 
about $1 million last year, only about 1% on revenue of $1 billion. The company 
is regarded as financially troubled because, in addition to its operating 
expenses, it must make payments on more than $370 million in long-term debt 
resulting from the 1987 acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
Late last year Greyhound offered the union a new three-year contract that 
included what the company described as a 6.9% increase in wages and benefits in 
the first year. 
</P>
<P>
Union members voted 92% against that offer on Jan. 26. The union has refused to 
disclose its demands. According to Greyhound, the union first sought $400 
million in pay and benefit increases over three years, about six times as much 
as Greyhound offered and the equivalent of a 33% first-year pay hike. The union 
this week cut that demand roughly in half, according to Greyhound.

The government of Ethiopia made an urgent appeal Friday for foreign aid, saying 
4.5 million people face starvation in war-torn northern Ethiopia five years 
after an estimated 1 million people perished there in another famine.

<P>
Ethiopia's high new figure included half a million people displaced from the

BUSH PRAISES TV FOR ENLISTING CARTOON HEROES IN WAR ON DRUGS; 
</P>
<P>
PRESIDENT'S VISIT: HE BRINGS HIS ANTI-DRUG MESSAGE TO SOUTHLAND ENTERTAINMENT 
EXECUTIVES AND SCHOOLCHILDREN.

President Bush -- acknowledging the historic moment that is bringing together, 
for the first time, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 
-- Friday praised the efforts of the television industry to bring about a 
change in America's attitudes toward drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech that was interrupted briefly when two protesters shouted out 
complaints that the Bush Administration is not doing enough about AIDS, the 
President said, "The days when popular culture glorified and glamorized drug 
use are fading fast." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's anti-drug talk included a discourse on the merits of an anti-drug TV 
show, "Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue," scheduled for broadcast April 21 and 
aimed at the massive audience of youngsters who watch such celluloid stars as 
ALF, the Chipmunks and Garfield each week. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a breakfast meeting of the Academy of Television Arts &amp; 
Sciences at the Century Plaza, Bush said: "Twenty million kids. Impressionable. 
Just asking to be entertained. And let me tell you something: Those 20 million 
kids in front of their TVs on any Saturday morning are the same target audience 
for every schoolyard drug pusher, five days a week. 
</P>
<P>
"Never before in cartoon history have Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck worked with the 
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the Muppets, the Smurfs and all the other stars 
of the cartoon world," he added, offering praise for Roy Disney, the executive 
producer and vice chairman of the board of directors of the Walt Disney Co., 
"for keeping all those egos in line." 
</P>
<P>
The theme of drug abuse has been worked into Bush's message throughout his 
public appearances on a four-day visit to Southern California. At midday -- 
before flying to Rancho Mirage for a summit meeting with Japanese Prime 
Minister Toshiki Kaifu -- Bush once again alluded to the entertainment world in 
a speech, telling thousands of schoolchildren at an anti-drug-abuse rally at 
the Santa Ana Bowl in Orange County: 
</P>
<P>
"We'll win the war on drugs because you have what a longtime resident of Orange 
County, John Wayne, had -- true grit." 
</P>
<P>
Urging the youngsters to shun drugs, the President quoted the late screen star 
and said, " 'There's right, and there's wrong. You gotta do one or the other. 
You do the one, and you're living. You do the other, and you may be walking 
around, but you're as dead as a beaver hat.' " 
</P>
<P>
In his early morning speech, Bush told the gathering of television producers, 
directors, writers and performers that "drugs and success simply do not mix." 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is, drugs don't care who you are, how famous you are or how much you 
earn. Drugs are deadly for everybody," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
The President, whose anti-drug plan focuses heavily on law enforcement efforts 
but also includes funding for education programs, referred to an incident early 
Thursday when about 900 pounds of cocaine was seized by Orange County sheriff's 
investigators in the Anaheim area. 
</P>
<P>
Interdiction of drugs is an important element in the anti-drug equation, Bush 
told some of Hollywood's leading executives, but he added that "if we want to 
win this war, big busts won't be enough." 
</P>
<P>
In the effort to drive down the demand for drugs, Bush said, each of them has 
"a unique ability to inform, and to change attitudes, and to catalyze public 
action in our fight against drug abuse." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's speech was interrupted when the first of two protesters stood up and 
shouted, "Why don't you ever talk about AIDS? Why don't you lead the country on 
AIDS?" 
</P>
<P>
As the audience began to boo the interruption, the man continued: "We need 
treatments now. It's not a laughing matter, Mr. Bush." And to the television 
industry audience, he said, "Are you people helping? Let's hear something about 
that, George." 
</P>
<P>
As he was hustled out by security guards, a second man took up his protest, 
standing up and calling out a similar message until he too was led out. 
</P>
<P>
After pausing in his text, Bush said, "We have increased federal help to an 
all-time high on AIDS." (The Bush Administration budget for AIDS this year is 
$1.6 billion.) 
</P>
<P>
The protesters identified themselves as Mark Kostopoulos, 35, of Echo Park and 
John Fall, a 27-year-old social worker from the Silver Lake area. Taken away in 
handcuffs, they were questioned by police but were not arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Both said they are members of the activist group ACT UP, which frequently 
protests Administration policy on AIDS. But they said they took the action as 
individuals.

UKRAINIAN NATIONALIST MOVEMENT: CHALLENGE GROWING FROM WITHIN; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: LEGALIZED LESS THAN A MONTH AGO, RUKH ALREADY HAS REMARKABLE 
INFLUENCE IN THE SECOND-LARGEST REPUBLIC IN THE NATION.

LVOV, Soviet Union 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A foreign visitor to this city in the western Ukraine recently tried to make an 
overseas telephone call, a request the hotel operator rejected as impossible. 
</P>
<P>
The visitor then approached the hotel manager, who said she too was powerless 
to help. "I'm just a government official," the manager said. "You'd better ask 
Rukh." 
</P>
<P>
Rukh -- the word means "the movement" in Ukrainian -- has remarkable influence 
in the Soviet Union's second-largest republic despite being legalized less than 
a month ago. Not only can it mysteriously transmit a fax to Chicago and arrange 
impossible-to-buy airline tickets, but its offices are filled with the young, 
the old and the lame seeking favors or help from the huge Soviet bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, this kind of patronage was the sole province of the Communist 
Party, which for all its shortcomings was the only political force in the 
country. Rukh has come up from the grass roots and harnessed a burgeoning 
dissatisfaction with Communist rule here into a potent political alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"Our popularity is very simple to explain," said Lubomir Senyk, a deputy leader 
of Rukh in Lvov. "The people don't trust the Communist Party anymore. Under the 
party, the Ukrainian people have known nothing but 70 years of trouble. The 
final goal of Rukh is an independent, united country of the Ukraine." 
</P>
<P>
Although Rukh had just 280,000 members at its founding last September, it 
managed to organize a human chain in January which stretched from Lvov to Kiev, 
a distance of more than 300 miles and utilizing more than 1 million people. 
</P>
<P>
"The influence of Rukh is quite significant," said Valery Matvyenko, deputy 
head of the Communist Party's ideological department in Kiev, the Ukrainian 
capital. "Many of Rukh's representatives are patriots whose goals are noble. 
But so far, Rukh is not an alternative party." 
</P>
<P>
Just how popular Rukh has become may become evident Sunday, when voters in the 
Ukraine select a new 450-seat parliament to govern their republic. Since Rukh 
was not legally recognized until Feb. 9, the group had little opportunity to 
draw up its own list of candidates. But independents are running against 
Communist Party-sponsored candidates in nearly every race, and the independents 
have largely gone over to Rukh. 
</P>
<P>
For example, at a legally sanctioned candidates meeting in Lvov on Thursday, 
three independent candidates withdrew from the race in the space of 10 minutes 
in favor of the Rukh-endorsed Mikhailo Goryn, who spent 12 years in jail for 
promoting Ukrainian nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
As the crowd of more than 1,000 chanted "Down with the red flag," speakers from 
the Communist Party were jeered and insulted. When Goryn spoke, the crowd waved 
the blue-and-yellow banner of Vladimir, a feudal knight who brought 
Christianity to the Ukraine, which is now the official Rukh flag. 
</P>
<P>
Goryn drew applause from the crowd by calling them "ladies and gentlemen," 
dispensing with the usual Communist greeting of "comrades." Launching into an 
attack on rule by Moscow, Goryn declared that the Ukraine "has not been working 
in the national interest, but in the interest of the empire." 
</P>
<P>
According to Ivan Gel, another Rukh activist in Lvov, the question of economic 
independence from Moscow is the hottest issue in the current election, with the 
Communist Party and Rukh taking clear-cut stands on opposite sides. 
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the Soviet leadership have a lot at stake in 
the Ukraine -- in addition to a population of 56 million, it produces nearly 
half the Soviet Union's iron ore, a quarter of the coal and more than 20% of 
the country's grain, meat and milk. 
</P>
<P>
(According to the Associated Press, about 1,500 miners in the Ukrainian coal 
capital of Donetsk walked off the job Friday to press demands that the local 
Communist Party leadership resign. The miners waved banners at a gathering in 
front of party headquarters, and 24 of them announced a hunger strike until the 
party leaders quit.) 
</P>
<P>
Gel said that in comparison to the Ukraine's economic might, the 
independence-minded Baltic republics are like two small Ukrainian regions. 
</P>
<P>
"It is understandable that Gorbachev is tolerant with calls for Baltic 
independence and intolerant with calls for independence of the Ukraine," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Rukh asserts that the Soviet authorities delayed giving Rukh legal 
status in hopes of derailing the organization's election campaigns. Rukh 
officials in Kiev said that a number of Rukh activists also have been fined or 
detained for 15 days for holding illegal meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"The main reason they didn't recognize us was to slow down the nomination of 
our candidates," said Sergei Golovaty, a member of Rukh's political organizing 
committee in Kiev. "But even if we win just 30% of the seats, that will be 
great progress. We will, for the first time, have a real opposition." 
</P>
<P>
Rukh leaders concede that their greatest strength lies in the western Ukraine, 
which dictator Josef Stalin absorbed from Poland in 1939, while the eastern 
Ukraine has been part of Russia for 300 years. Rukh leaders maintain that the 
different historical backgrounds help account for the higher level of political 
consciousness in the west. 
</P>
<P>
It is also true, however, that the eastern Ukraine contains a much larger 
percentage of ethnic Russians and other minorities, who have been lukewarm to 
some of the nationalist changes proposed by Rukh. 
</P>
<P>
For example, last October, after substantial prodding from Rukh, the republic's 
parliament adopted Ukrainian as an official state language, a move which was 
highly popular among Ukrainians but considered threatening by some in the 
Russian minority. 
</P>
<P>
Rukh is actually a coalition of vastly different interest groups principally 
united now by their opposition to Communist Party rule from Moscow. The 
constituent parts range from the Ukrainian Helsinki Union, which is considered 
radical leftist, to members of the long-suppressed Ukrainian Greek Catholic 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
Ivan Drach, a poet who was chosen as leader of Rukh last September, is also a 
member of the Communist Party, as are a number of high Rukh officials. But Rukh 
spokesmen dismiss this as a "paradox," which they say merely reflects the lack 
of choices available before the Gorbachev political thaw. 
</P>
<P>
Rukh officials in Lvov said even the local police have refused to take action 
against Rukh meetings, telling Interior Ministry officials to send police from 
outside the area. 
</P>
<P>
Rukh has had great success in identifying issues which are of burning concern 
here, so much so in fact that Communist Party candidates in the current 
election campaign have started mimicking Rukh propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
An example is the Chernobyl nuclear power station. Rukh leaders have demanded 
that Chernobyl be closed entirely on safety grounds, a position reluctantly 
supported by the Ukrainian Communist Party leadership only three months ago. 
Now, the decision has been made to phase out the plant over five years. 
</P>
<P>
Rukh is also taking the lead on other sensitive environmental issues such as 
the high level of pesticides in the soil, a crucial issue in this agricultural 
region. 
</P>
<P>
Rukh has stopped short of calling for immediate independence from the Soviet 
Union, as have the Baltic states and Moldavia. But Rukh has demanded what it 
refers to as economic sovereignty, meaning that the ownership of the republic's 
industries should be transferred to the Ukraine from ministries in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"The Ukraine can exist without the help of the Soviet Union and still feed the 
people around it," said Lvov candidate Goryn. "Soon we too will be fighting for 
world markets. The West will have to provide a place in the sun for Ukrainians 
to dance."

<P>
Russian moviegoers primed for entertainment on a blustery winter evening this 
week were fidgeting in their seats and waiting for the delayed start of an 
adventure film when a lone man in suit and tie walked onto the theater's dimly 
lit stage. 
</P>
<P>
To the surprised audience, candidate Valery I. Ikonnikov began expounding his 
platform for economic and political change. But the 700 people in the audience 
were in no mood for a lecture. 
</P>
<P>
Mothers tried halfheartedly, and largely in vain, to hush their giggling 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"Independence from Moscow!" a man called out from the back of the theater, 
apropos of nothing, then returned to the private conversation he was having 
with the woman next to him. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually on the eve of Sunday's election for parliament in the Russian 
Republic, voter apathy is evident in this sprawling industrial center of a 
million people about 600 miles southeast of Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The apathy, more widespread than President Mikhail S. Gorbachev would like to 
admit, stems from a firm conviction that in most places there is no real 
alternative yet to the Communist Party, and that the party's most outspoken 
reform-minded politicians will eventually let the people down. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, for Ikonnikov, a 51-year-old economist, the seven minutes he 
spent in the theater trying to get the audience's attention were far more 
useful than the 90-minute meeting he hurried to from the theater. This was an 
organized meet-your-candidate program, and it was attended by only six voters. 
</P>
<P>
"In the theater I must overcome the resistance of the audience," he said later 
in an interview, "but at least I get a chance to speak to 700 people, and maybe 
they will remember my name. It is best to surprise them. If you try to arrange 
a planned meeting with voters, few attend. People here don't believe anymore in 
politics or politicians." 
</P>
<P>
Ikonnikov, a Communist, is running against four other candidates for a seat in 
the regional parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Volgograd, like many other cities in the Russian heartland, is a stronghold of 
conservatism, riddled with distrust of what are perceived as newfangled ideas. 
Gorbachev is sure to face real and lasting problems in winning acceptance here 
for many of his reforms, and some analysts warn that his programs may falter 
due to entrenched resistance in communities like this one. 
</P>
<P>
The city was the site of 200 days of fighting between the Soviet and German 
armies in World War II, and it was all but destroyed. In those days it was 
called Stalingrad, and in the last year or so some people have called for 
restoring the old name. 
</P>
<P>
People here say that Gorbachev may promise that times are changing, and that 
maybe some other people believe it in the once-repressed republics now tasting 
new freedoms. But here all they see are the same type of leaders, a lot of 
talk, endless food shortages, long waits for housing, and disruptions in water 
and gas supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, while Gorbachev is taking steps to diminish the power of the 
Communist Party all across the Soviet Union, here and in other distant places 
almost everything is still dependent on the party organization. 
</P>
<P>
"There is great skepticism about whether things can ever really change, no 
matter what anyone says," Valery Konovolov, a senior editor of the newspaper 
Volgogradskaya Pravda, said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, party members have been given the best jobs, the best education, 
the opportunity to travel abroad, to go to the theater, sometimes even to read 
books forbidden to the general public. Even today it is the party members who 
are the smooth speakers, who seem to have polish, glamour and some link to real 
power. 
</P>
<P>
But the party leaders, even those with Gorbachev's personal seal of approval, 
are still playing by the old rules, rules that ignore the common people, 
Volgograders say. A case in point, they say, is Vladimir Kalashnikov. 
</P>
<P>
Kalashnikov was the city's leader until January, when he was forced to resign 
along with 14 other Volgograd party leaders accused of corruption and 
mismanagement. He was a Gorbachev protege, once heralded as a rising star of 
perestroika, Gorbachev's program to restructure the Soviet society. Now he is 
hospitalized in Moscow, suffering, party officials say, from a disorder brought 
on by stress and nerves. 
</P>
<P>
His downfall was the result of several rather typical sins. Like many other 
local party officials, he provided a relative and several close friends with 
apartments without requiring that they wait the necessary three to five years. 
</P>
<P>
"I have certain privileges," he said, without embarrassment, in an interview 
with the Moscow magazine Ogonyok. 
</P>
<P>
He angered many people when, in an attempt to modernize, he introduced a new 
irrigation system that was widely distrusted by old-timers. It led to massive 
soil erosion in farming areas. 
</P>
<P>
And in what has come to be known as Kalashnikov's "anti-tomato campaign," he 
made a misguided effort to clamp down on speculators by ordering the 
destruction of garden plots where factory workers and retired people raised 
vegetables to sell in local markets. This resulted not only in the loss of 
much-needed income for Volgograders; vegetables had to be brought in from other 
regions, sending prices up sharply. 
</P>
<P>
Kalashnikov resigned after Ogonyok published an account of his misdeeds. 
</P>
<P>
"It is too bad about Kalashnikov," candidate Ikonnikov said with a shrug. "He 
thought he was just doing what party leaders have always done, only a little 
better. In different circumstances, if he had had better luck, he might 
eventually have become a Politburo member. And not the worst one, at that. 
</P>
<P>
"But his demise shows the people will no longer allow the party to exist as it 
is. It must die as the all-powerful, privileged institution if it is to survive 
at all." 
</P>
<P>
Volgograd is not like the Baltic republics or some of the other 
independent-minded regions, where a variety of political parties have sprung 
up. Here it is still the Communists who are regarded as the only legitimate, if 
sometimes decadent, power-holders. 
</P>
<P>
There are 141 candidates for the 18 seats allotted to Volgograd in the regional 
parliament, and of those candidates less than 7% are non-party members. 
</P>
<P>
One is Nikolai A. Beskaravainov, a worker for the last 27 years in a 
tool-making factory. His approach to meeting voters is mainly to introduce 
himself as a non-Communist and to remind his audience that the party has messed 
up the country. 
</P>
<P>
But Beskaravainov, reed-thin and looking older than his 46 years, talks 
hurriedly from notes and without the confidence that voters are used to seeing 
in party officials. 
</P>
<P>
In an appearance this week at Volgograd State University, some in the largely 
inattentive audience appeared to have trouble taking him seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you consider yourself to be a politician?" one student asked. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview later, Beskaravainov reflected on the problems he has faced in 
the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Unlike most of the party members," he said, "I don't have a telephone at home 
to use to recruit support. I don't have a private car. And I don't have the 
party machine behind me. The manager of the plant where I have worked all my 
life refused to give me his backing because I wasn't a party member and because 
the plant's party committee opposed me. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that sometimes I don't reach the voters, because I can't express myself 
properly on the podium. I haven't had years of practice. Still, I hope to be 
elected. There is a real distrust of the party, and maybe that will work in my 
favor." 
</P>
<P>
Many Volgograders seem to have the same attitude as Nikolai D. Fomenko, a 
lifelong resident who says he last tried to vote 10 years ago, after work and 
just before the polls closed. 
</P>
<P>
"The registrar looked at the records and said my name had been crossed out, 
indicating I'd already voted," he recalled. "I thought, 'So that's how it is.' 
And that is the last time I ever tried to vote." 
</P>
<P>
Fomenko is not eager to change this. He said he does not know the names of the 
candidates in his district. 
</P>
<P>
"They are all the same, aren't they?" he asked rhetorically. "In fact 
everything, in Volgograd at least, is pretty much the same."

SENATE REVOLT PREDICTED TO BOLSTER CLEAN AIR BILL; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: BOTH WILSON AND CRANSTON SAY THEY WILL SEEK TO RESTORE PROVISIONS 
DELETED BY NEGOTIATORS. THEY ADMIT THEY FACE AN UPHILL FIGHT.

<P>
Maintaining that the nation's dirtiest cities need tougher pollution controls, 
a group of dissenting senators led by California's Pete Wilson and Alan 
Cranston said Friday they will introduce legislation to restore some of the 
stringent provisions deleted from the compromise clean air bill crafted by 
Senate and White House negotiators earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
The senators conceded they may face an uphill fight, given an agreement by the 
White House and the Senate leadership to oppose any attempts to alter the key 
elements of the bipartisan compromise announced on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But Wilson, announcing plans to introduce an amendment to strengthen the bill's 
clean fuels program, said there were "a great many senators who will join us in 
this" and predicted that a floor revolt against the compromise will have 
"considerable" support. 
</P>
<P>
"The overwhelming majority of senators are not committed to what they (the 
negotiators) accomplished," said Cranston, adding that a broad coalition of 
Western, Northeastern and Midwestern senators was likely to support changes in 
the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Any serious attempt to challenge the clean air accord would put Wilson, the 
Republican candidate for governor of California, on another of his occasional 
collision courses with the White House. Wilson recently incurred the wrath of 
White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu when he voted to override a 
presidential veto of a measure that would have placed severe restrictions on 
the joint development of a fighter plane with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
It would also represent a slap in the face to Senate Majority Leader George J. 
Mitchell (D-Me.), who invested enormous amounts of both time and prestige in 
crafting a compromise that bridges the deep regional and ideological divisions 
that for the past 10 years have prevented clean air legislation from coming to 
the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
"This has really been Mitchell's show from the beginning. He worked extremely 
hard on this, to the point where it has become his first major test as majority 
leader," a Senate staffer close to the clean air talks said. 
</P>
<P>
In agreeing to some of the changes sought by the Administration, Mitchell and 
the Senate subcommittee that drafted the bill neutralized the threat of a 
filibuster that would have been mounted by a loose coalition of Republicans and 
Democrats representing the auto, oil and coal-mining industries, among other 
business interests. They also eliminated the threat of a veto by President 
Bush, who believed the Senate bill would cost too much to implement. 
</P>
<P>
To accommodate the conflicting interests, the negotiators drafted complex 
formulas to reduce automobile emissions, regulate the release of toxic 
chemicals and lower the emission of acid-rain causing sulfur dioxide by 
coal-burning utilities. 
</P>
<P>
Also included in the bill is an alternative fuels program that would mandate 
the development and use of automotive fuels at least three times as clean as 
conventional gasoline in Los Angeles and eight other urban areas that have the 
worst smog problems in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Defending it as the best deal than can pass the Senate, Mitchell said the 
compromise "dramatically expands clean air laws in the most cost-effective 
manner." 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the bill would: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lower the emissions of smog-causing hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides from 
automobile tailpipes by 22% and 60% respectively over a three-year period 
beginning in 1993, with a second round of 50% emission cuts taking effect in 
2003 if 12 or more cities with serious pollution problems have not met federal 
clean air standards by the end of 2001. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Require industries to control the emissions of 191 toxic chemicals with the 
"best available technology," taking cost into account, by 1997, with the 
National Academy of Sciences to assess the remaining risks to health and the 
need for further controls after that date. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Require Midwestern utilities to cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 million 
tons by the year 2000, with a cap at 1980 levels after that, with some 
relaxation of the restrictions and extra "pollution credits" for utilities that 
use specific cleanup technologies or lower emissions below the required level. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mandate the use of reformulated gasoline in nine cities with the worst smog 
by 1995, but allow California to proceed with its own, much stricter 
alternative fuels program. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's clean fuels amendment would allow other states to immediately adopt 
the so-called "California-New York Alternative" based on a California program 
that requires the production of 150,000 clean-fuel vehicles in 1994, 300,000 in 
1995 and 400,000 in 1996. Any of various alternative fuels could be used as 
long as they meet emissions standards twice as strict as those required in the 
Senate bill for conventionally fueled cars. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Wilson and Cranston, other senators supporting the amendment include 
Timothy E. Wirth (D-Colo.), Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) and John D. (Jay) 
Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.). Sens. Frank R. Lautenberg (D-N.J.) and Joseph I. 
Lieberman (D-Conn.), two dissident members of the Senate subcommittee that 
wrote the bill, are also expected to support the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Lautenberg and Lieberman, who refused to support the compromise, plan to 
introduce amendments to strengthen the automobile and air toxics provisions of 
the bill. 
</P>
<P>
A Wilson aide said the senator was unsure whether the Senate leadership would 
regard the alternative fuels proposal as a "killer amendment" aimed at cracking 
the compromise, which is so delicately crafted that it could all fall apart if 
any of its components is changed. If that turns out to be the case, then 
Mitchell and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) will muster their forces 
to defeat it. 
</P>
<P>
However, other sources said there were already indications that the compromise 
may be starting to crumble because of dissatisfaction with the bill among a 
number of senators. 
</P>
<P>
"The two leaders seem to think that the hard part is over, but in truth it may 
only just be beginning," one Senate aide said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UNDER FIRE: THE CLEAN AIR COMPROMISE 
</P>
<P>
Although criticized by environmentalists as too weak to help Los Angeles and 
other badly polluted urban areas clean up their air, the compromise crafted by 
Senate and White House negotiators substantially strengthens current clean air 
laws. Here is a comparison: 
</P>
<P>
AUTOMOTIVE EMISSIONS: 
</P>
<P>
Current Law: 
</P>
<P>
Restricts automobile tailpipe emissions of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides, 
the precursers of urban smog, to 0.41 gram per mile (gpm) for hydrocarbons and 
1.0 gpm for nitrogen oxides (NOx). 
</P>
<P>
Senate/White House Compromise: 
</P>
<P>
Reduces hydrocarbon emissions to .25 gpm and NOx emissions to .4 gpm by 1995, 
with further reductions of 50% for both pollutants in the year 2003 if 12 or 
more cities currently classified as having "serious" pollution problems are not 
in attainment by the end of 2001. 
</P>
<P>
ALTERNATIVE FUELS: 
</P>
<P>
Current Law: 
</P>
<P>
No provision for alternative fuels in current law. 
</P>
<P>
Senate/White House Compromise: 
</P>
<P>
Requires reformulated gasoline or similarly clean fuels to be used in cars sold 
in nine cities with the worst smog by 1994. Similar regulations would also 
apply to fleet vehicles, starting in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
ACID RAIN: 
</P>
<P>
Current Law: 
</P>
<P>
No provisions for acid rain control currently in effect. 
</P>
<P>
Senate/White House Compromise: 
</P>
<P>
Requires 107 polluting utilities in the Midwest and Southeast to cut sulfur 
dioxide emissions by 10 million tons in the year 2000, when emission levels 
would be capped at 1980 levels. Utilities also would cut NOx emissions by 4 
million tons by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
An"allowance" system would let utilities reducing emissions below the required 
levels sell "pollution credits" to others. Special incentives would also be 
granted to utilities to use clean coal technology known as "scrubbers." 
</P>
<P>
AIR TOXICS: 
</P>
<P>
Current Law: 
</P>
<P>
Imposes controls on the emissions of seven chemicals classified as toxic, but 
enforcement has been lax. 
</P>
<P>
Senate/White House Compromise: 
</P>
<P>
Requires industry to use best available technology, taking cost into account, 
to control emissions of 191 air toxics by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
EPA could impose additional health-based standards after that, depending on the 
results of a risk assessment study to be conducted by the National Academy of 
Sciences.

OHIO HIGH COURT LIFTS JUDGE'S ORDERS TO MEDIA IN MURDER CASE

The Ohio Supreme Court, acting on a suit filed by several news media outlets, 
late Friday lifted a series of orders issued by the judge in the case of the 
alleged cult slayings of five members of a family. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to imposing a gag order on defense lawyers and prosecutors, Lake 
County Common Pleas Judge Martin Parks ordered local television stations to 
save all videotapes of their coverage of the slayings and prohibited them from 
filming one of the defendants, Ronald Luff of Independence, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
But NBC and its Cleveland subsidiary, WKYC-TV, filed a challenge Friday with 
the state Supreme Court. Joining WKYC were WJW, the local CBS affiliate, WEWS, 
the ABC affiliate, independent WUAB and the Cleveland Plain Dealer. 
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental question is whether a trial judge may arbitrarily restrain 
(the media's) rights to gather and disseminate news through the issuance of 
orders against them without notice or opportunity to be heard," the station's 
motion said. "The U.S. and Ohio constitutions declare that such orders are void 
and unenforceable." 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 3-4, the bodies of Dennis Avery, 49, his wife Cheryl, 42, and their 
three children, Trina, 15, Rebecca, 13, and Karen, 6, were found buried in a 
common grave in a barn in Kirtland, Ohio, where a religious cult had stayed for 
several months. 
</P>
<P>
They were shot in April, allegedly at the orders of cult leader Jeffrey 
Lundgren. 
</P>
<P>
Lundgren, the leader of the group which had broken away from the Reorganized 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and 12 other defendants have been 
indicted on various charges, with Lundgren, his son, Damon, and three others 
facing capital murder charges.

SENATE ETHICS PANEL PROBING DURENBERGER'S PAID APPEARANCES

The Senate Ethics Committee is investigating 113 paid appearances by Sen. Dave 
Durenberger (R-Minn.) to determine whether he violated limits on outside income 
in 1985-86, according to a letter from the panel released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The letter to Durenberger, required under the panel's rules, provided 
additional details of its investigation into the lawmaker's controversial book 
contract and other dealings. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the panel had not previously disclosed how many paid 
book-promotion appearances by Durenberger were under investigation. Other newly 
released information provided details on travel reimbursements, a campaign 
check possibly converted to personal use, book-promotion speeches in the U.S. 
Capitol and gifts of limousine service. 
</P>
<P>
The committee voted last week to hold trial-like proceedings to determine 
whether Senate rules had been violated by Durenberger, or whether any of his 
actions should be referred to the Justice Department for a criminal 
investigation. The panel's letter to the senator was a formal notice of the 
action and a statement of possible violations. 
</P>
<P>
Durenberger said after receiving the letter: "I will continue to cooperate 
fully with the committee and will present evidence demonstrating that there was 
no intent on my part to violate or circumvent Senate rules." 
</P>
<P>
The panel wrote Durenberger that "you may have violated" two separate laws on 
outside-income limits "through an arrangement with your publisher, Piranha 
Press." 
</P>
<P>
Under an arrangement that has been widely publicized, the committee said that 
Durenberger charged businesses, associations and other organizations an 
appearance fee, as senators usually do when speaking in their official capacity 
as lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
But Durenberger has said that the appearances under investigation were part of 
a deal he made with his publisher to promote books he had written on health and 
defense issues. He has contended that the fees earned should not have counted 
toward the Senate's outside-earnings limitations. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the organizations have said that they considered the appearances 
standard speeches by a senator and that the books were not mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
The panel told Durenberger he turned over his fees to the publisher, "in 
exchange for which you received $100,000" from Piranha. 
</P>
<P>
The committee letter said Durenberger "may have violated" Senate rules -- and 
the Ethics In Government Act -- "by failing to disclose in a timely fashion" 
the travel-expense reimbursements he received from 43 of the appearances. The 
panel previously had not disclosed the number of reimbursements under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Durenberger amended his financial disclosure forms last July to include the 
reimbursement data.

POOR STORAGE RUINING NASA DATA, REPORT SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
SCIENCE: THE GAO CHARGES IRREPLACEABLE TAPES MAY BE DAMAGED BEYOND REPAIR. 
SPACE AGENCY OFFICIALS STRONGLY DISPUTE THE FINDINGS. 
</P>

<P>
Hundreds of thousands of magnetic tapes containing irreplaceable scientific 
data from American space missions are deteriorating -- and perhaps damaged 
beyond repair -- because of improper storage and management, the General 
Accounting Office said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has stored at least 1.2 
million reels of information beeped back to Earth from orbiting satellites and 
lunar and planetary probes during the 32-year history of the American space 
program, the GAO reported. 
</P>
<P>
Yet NASA "does not have an agency-wide inventory of its data" and "does not 
know what is being retained and where it is located," endangering critical 
information that could be vital to future scientific ventures, the GAO 
investigators charged. 
</P>
<P>
In a report prepared for the House Space, Science and Technology Committee, the 
federal auditing agency said eight of 10 storage and processing facilities it 
inspected failed to fully satisfy the accepted regulations for storing such 
material. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the facilities were in compliance with fewer than half of the 
government and industry archival guidelines, the GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
NASA sharply disputed the major findings contained in the 76-page document, 
challenging the GAO's assertion that it has failed to protect space-science 
data as a national resource for future generations. 
</P>
<P>
John E. O'Brien, NASA assistant deputy administrator, said in a letter printed 
along with the GAO findings that the report was "unnecessarily harsh, and 
contains sweeping generalizations and extrapolations which we believe to be 
unfounded and unsubstantiated." 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, O'Brien said NASA could find no evidence that important data has 
been lost as a result of mismanagement. And he said that all of the 
recommendations offered by the GAO already were being addressed. 
</P>
<P>
The report was issued as NASA prepares to go to Congress for the first major 
funding of new space programs, which will produce a flow of information 
dwarfing the output of satellites and deep-space payloads launched in the past. 
</P>
<P>
The report cited as an example the planned Earth Observation System, which 
would gather data needed to accurately forecast the effects of global warming. 
</P>
<P>
If deployed as now recommended by the space agency, the system would generate a 
volume of data equivalent to all the books in the Library of Congress every six 
weeks, the GAO said. One of its orbiting platforms, loaded with a dozen 
scientific instruments, would transmit a trillion bits of data per day, enough 
to fill 700 high-density magnetic tapes. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Congress who are seeking data needed for computer models of global 
climate behavior have taken new interest in finding out how much and what kind 
of information the space agency already has collected. 
</P>
<P>
"NASA's data management has been one of its weakest features," said Sen. Albert 
Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.), chairman of a Senate subcommittee on science, technology 
and space. "We've been trying for months to complete an inventory of exactly 
what they have, where it is, and how it can be accessed. It has been an 
eye-opening experience." 
</P>
<P>
The GAO investigators reported finding space-research data in storage 
facilities that failed to meet criteria for temperature and humidity control, 
fire and water protection and tape maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
More important, the report said, some of the most significant tape-management 
deficiencies were found in the two largest facilities responsible for managing 
irreplaceable data: the National Space Science Data Center at NASA's Goddard 
Space Flight Center in Maryland and a U.S. Geological Survey facility in Sioux 
Falls, S.D. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO report noted that officials at Caltech's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
which controls the United States' planetary space missions, have determined 
that important data has been lost through faulty storage and management. 
</P>
<P>
JPL officials "with substantial experience and expertise" estimated that half 
of the 130,000 tapes the laboratory had stored at the Los Angeles Federal 
Records Center at Laguna Niguel "may be damaged beyond recovery or contain data 
of little or no value," the GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
"This evidence, combined with the serious physical storage conditions . . . 
substantiates our concern that NASA's space-science data stored on magnetic 
tapes are at serious risk of becoming partially or completely unusable," the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
Concern about deterioration of data gathered by the Voyager, Viking and Mariner 
spacecraft led JPL officials to copy 12,500 reels of tape in 1983 to preserve 
priceless information gathered from the planets of Mercury, Mars, Venus, 
Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune. The $495,000 project showed that efforts to 
restore 10-year-old tapes often led to their destruction. 
</P>
<P>
NASA is now experimenting with the use of optical disks as a replacement for 
magnetic tapes. 
</P>
<P>
At Goddard Space Flight Center, 10,000 tapes of satellite data have been stored 
on just 243 disks, but the GAO report said it is too early to tell whether 
improvements offered by that technology address the myriad problems of data 
storage, preservation and dissemination. 
</P>
<P>
While the report primarily blamed NASA for the "deplorable conditions" under 
which the scientific data is stored and maintained, it said the General 
Services Administration and the National Archives and Records Administration 
also share responsibility.

FDA EXPANDS USE OF DRUG IN TREATING AIDS PATIENTS; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: AZT NOW MAY BE GIVEN TO VICTIMS IN THE EARLIER STAGES OF THE DEADLY 
DISEASE, RESULTING IN BETTER CARE, EXPERTS SAY.

The Food and Drug Administration on Friday expanded approved uses of the 
antiviral drug AZT to include AIDS patients in the early stages of the disease 
and individuals who are infected with the AIDS virus but have not developed 
overt symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
Among the latter group, the FDA said, the drug should be administered only to 
patients whose T4 cell count has dropped below 500 cells per cubic millimeter 
of blood, an indication of immune system deterioration. The normal range for 
the critical immune system cells -- the primary targets of the human 
immunodeficiency virus -- is 800 to 1,200. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the FDA action, "better treatment can now be offered to 
thousands of people at earlier stages of infection with the AIDS virus before 
their health deteriorates critically," Health and Human Services Secretary 
Louis W. Sullivan said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
AZT, also known as zidovudene, previously was approved only for use by patients 
with fully developed AIDS or advanced AIDS-related complex. 
</P>
<P>
For patients who need the drug in the early stages of the disease, the FDA 
decision means that AZT therapy will be covered by insurance companies and 
other third-party payers. Insurers typically refuse to reimburse purchases of 
drugs prescribed for nonapproved uses. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, many AIDS experts believe the action will result in an increased 
willingness to test other experimental drugs for use at an earlier stage of the 
disease, speeding up the timetable for making the medications available. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been pushing for awhile to look at HIV disease as a continuous disease 
spectrum," said Dr. Paul Volberding, an AIDS specialist at San Francisco 
General Hospital. "Now a drug has been shown to be effective at both ends of 
the spectrum of disease." 
</P>
<P>
Volberding was the lead researcher on a study that demonstrated the 
effectiveness of AZT on individuals who are infected with the AIDS virus but 
have not yet developed overt symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
A panel of scientists convened by the National Institute of Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases is scheduled to meet in Washington today to draft a 
blueprint for physicians on how and when to prescribe AZT during early 
infection. The recommendations are to be released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA action, which formally adopted recommendations made by the agency's 
antiviral drugs advisory committee in January, also is expected to encourage 
more individuals to take the AIDS antibody test to determine whether they are 
infected. 
</P>
<P>
"It is now time for people to find out," Volberding said. "The potential of 
benefits from this therapy are only effective at this stage if you know you are 
infected." 
</P>
<P>
The agency's action clearly was prompted by the results of studies of AZT use 
by AIDS patients in the early stages of the disease and those who are infected 
but asymptomatic. 
</P>
<P>
The findings, announced last August, were so compelling that the studies were 
stopped for most of the participants so that those who had been taking a 
medically worthless placebo for comparison purposes could receive AZT instead. 
</P>
<P>
The first study showed that AZT "significantly" slows the progression of 
disease in patients with early AIDS-related complex, a finding federal health 
officials estimated could benefit an estimated 95,000 to 200,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, the government said a second study had shown that AZT could 
delay the onset of AIDS in infected individuals with T4 cell counts of 500 or 
fewer per cubic millimeter of blood. The study also included infected 
individuals with T4 counts of more than 500, but the information was 
inconclusive. Research on that group is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
The studies showed that AZT was better tolerated by patients who received it 
early. Many individuals with fully developed AIDS have experienced toxic side 
effects from AZT. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA's decision could affect about 600,000 of the estimated 1 million 
infected individuals in this country, federal health officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
AZT, the only antiviral drug approved to treat AIDS, has been in widespread use 
since late 1986 and was formally approved in March, 1987. It has been shown to 
significantly prolong the lives of those with AIDS and AIDS-related complex and 
to reduce the frequency and severity of the infections that characterize the 
deadly disease.

OLD GHOSTS OF RACISM RETURN TO HAUNT SELMA; 
</P>
<P>
CIVIL RIGHTS: IT IS THE EVE OF THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF ITS FAMOUS MARCH. AND 
THE ALABAMA TOWN IS ONCE MORE BEING TORMENTED BY ANGER AND MISTRUST.

SELMA, Ala. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the local visitor-information center, a fuchsia T-shirt makes an ironic 
point: In white letters, the shirt lists, from top to bottom, London, Paris, 
Rome, Selma. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles probably is not as well known as Selma, Ala.," George (Cap) Swift, 
the center's vice president, says with a mixture of pride and exasperation. 
</P>
<P>
He may be right. Selma burned its name into history with blood, anger and 
racial confrontation 25 years ago at the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Civil rights 
marchers trying to cross the bridge were beaten by Alabama state troopers on 
"Bloody Sunday," and the national revulsion that followed led to passage of the 
1965 Voting Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
A celebration of the march's silver anniversary is due Sunday, but plans for a 
harmonious event, which could show how far people here have come, are fading. 
Once again, Selma is a town of anger and racial mistrust. 
</P>
<P>
The school board, six whites and five blacks, voted on strict racial lines not 
to renew the contract of Norward Roussell, Selma's first black schools 
superintendent. The Dec. 21 vote set off a furor among blacks which resulted in 
schools being closed for five days and leading parents of some 300 students, 
mostly white, to withdraw their children from public schools. The five black 
members quit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Racial Tension Strong 
</P>
<P>
Racial tension now runs strong through this middle Alabama town of 27,000 
people, about evenly divided among black and white. Everybody hopes the 
commemorative march, which begins here and ends 54 miles and five days later in 
Montgomery, will be peaceful. The events leading up to it have been anything 
but. 
</P>
<P>
Several black people were arrested for demonstrating at Mayor Joe Smitherman's 
office, including an attorney, Rose Sanders, who charged that a police officer 
roughed her up. A few days ago, a police officer sat guard outside Smitherman's 
office, while black protesters held a sit-in on the porch of the two-story 
brick building and launched a boycott of white businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Many whites express embarrassment, fear, loathing and resentment that the town 
must relive its past. Defenders of the school board's white majority say that 
Roussell's contract should not have been renewed based on the board's 1989 
evaluation of his performance, which rated him a poor manager and asserted that 
he intimidates employees and hurts morale. 
</P>
<P>
Roussell denies the charges, as do his supporters. 
</P>
<P>
For some black organizers of the march, the resulting caldron is brewing an 
opportunity, a chance to recapture the old-time civil rights spirit. 
</P>
<P>
"This could be a positive thing," said Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), who as a leader 
of the 1965 march was severely beaten by troopers and mounted deputies. "This 
could be the spark that energizes the people. Most of the people in the black 
and white communities wanted to see this as a genuine celebration, but now it's 
going to be a protest and celebration." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Like the Old 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the new, progressive Selma that Smitherman and other white leaders 
wanted to show off to the world during the 25th anniversary of the march now 
seems much like the old Selma. 
</P>
<P>
Over on Small Street, Barbara Johnson, a 40-year-old Selma native, was 
frustrated and angry, seeing Roussell's situation as yet another example of 
Selma's racist reality. "White people just don't want no black up over them," 
she told a visitor. "You know that." 
</P>
<P>
Not far away, John Henry, a white man who runs a fruit and vegetable stand, 
spat tobacco juice and declared: "They're saying it's (the school board 
decision) racial, but white people are the ones put him in there." 
</P>
<P>
The school battle has precipitated black anger over a lack of political and 
economic clout which has persisted over the decades. 
</P>
<P>
Minnie Harrison, secretary at the Booker T. Washington Insurance Co., said: "We 
haven't advanced too much from 1965. Whites haven't changed; they've just been 
laying low for a while." 
</P>
<P>
White people see the situation differently. Many say the only lying low they've 
done has been hiding their identity when they travel. 
</P>
<P>
Glynn Williams, a white man who was just a year old during the 1965 Selma 
march, recalled how, in his travels over the years, "people would ask me: 
'Where're you from?' I'd just say Montgomery. They'd say: 'Oh, we hear you 
still have lynch mobs. Does that still go on?' " 
</P>
<P>
Williams' sister, Christy Williams, 21, said that attitude has made her feel 
that black people "were going to hate me." Worn out by the resurgence of 
obvious racial strain, she pleaded: "Let's just start from now." 
</P>
<P>
But many black people here say they began the current protest because the now 
is as bad as the then. Educational inequities, inability to get business loans, 
and the residual effect of the old at-large voting system all are mentioned as 
evidence of wrongs by the white power structure. 
</P>
<P>
"When I demonstrated in the '60s, I didn't think I'd have to do that again," 
said Jonah Posey, the 46-year-old manager of the Booker T. Washington Insurance 
Co. "I don't want my kids to have to do the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
The area's depressed economy has aggravated the problem. The county's 12.2% 
unemployment rate last year was more than double the nation's 5.3% rate and far 
exceeded the state's 7.1%. Last year's median family income for the county was 
$20,100, compared with the national average of $32,400. 
</P>
<P>
William Barnard, chairman of the history department at the University of 
Alabama, described Selma as a paradox: "both the ultimate achievement of the 
civil rights movement and an indicator of the limits of that movement." He said 
there is an increasing "awareness that as significant as that struggle was, 
that still doesn't deal with the economic and structural problems of rural 
areas like Selma." 
</P>
<P>
In the middle of the racial storm are two men -- Smitherman and Roussell. 
Ironically, both may be on their way out. Smitherman said in an interview that 
he will not seek reelection when his seventh term expires in 1992. And 
Roussell, in a separate interview, said he is seeking another superintendent's 
job elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
No one in this town symbolizes the target of black anger more than Smitherman, 
who has been mayor for 24 of the last 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Smitherman's wood-paneled office, in a building within sight of the Edmund 
Pettus Bridge, is a history tour in pictures. On the wall, there's Smitherman 
with George Wallace, over there he's with Bob Hope. Here he is with Jesse 
Jackson in a newspaper clipping. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, look -- me and Jesse," the mayor tells a visitor, pointing to a picture 
from the 1988 Democratic convention, a happier time than now. 
</P>
<P>
These days he is forced to defend his past as if it were yesterday. Yes, he was 
a segregationist. "You had to be a segregationist to run," but "we've 
moderated, and all that's behind us." 
</P>
<P>
Smitherman in recent years has worked hard to cultivate a new image as 
pragmatist, preaching accommodation and praising Selma for racial progress. 
Forty percent black fire department, 30% black police department, he said, 
ticking off racial statistics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Image Tarnished 
</P>
<P>
The new image was fine until the Roussell dispute. He does acknowledge wanting 
Roussell to abide by the school board's decision to get rid of him, declaring 
"a contract is a contract. Normally, people abide by a contract." 
</P>
<P>
As for the black protesters, Smitherman dismissed them as opportunists who are 
using him as a "straw man" to whip up enthusiasm among black voters. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor, who said that at age 60, he is "tired" and "worn out," portrayed 
himself as caught between the two races here. Black protesters march just a few 
feet from his office. At the same time, Smitherman said, "I get white pressure 
on me," adding that "it's vital you have white support of that (school) 
system." 
</P>
<P>
Around the corner, at Roussell's office, no pictures are on the wall, no 
plaques -- only the nails that held them. The superintendent hastily removed 
most of his belongings when the board tried last month to fire him immediately. 
</P>
<P>
He came to the 11-school, 6,000-student system, which is 70% black, in 1987 
from New Orleans, where he had failed to win the superintendent's job. He said 
he found "great disparity" between instructional materials provided black and 
white students here, asserting that he set about bringing equality to all and 
dismantling a "leveling" system that unfairly grouped black and poor white 
children in slow-learner classes. 
</P>
<P>
Roussell disputes the board's evaluation of his performance, saying that "any 
black leaders who are assertive (are called) abrasive."

DIVIDED PANEL PRESENTS $66-BILLION MEDICAL-CARE PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: IT WOULD PROVIDE INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR ALL AMERICANS. BUT KEY 
LAWMAKERS SAY IT HAS NO CHANCE TO PASS. 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bitterly divided congressional commission called Friday for an ambitious 
$66-billion expansion of federal spending to provide health insurance coverage 
for all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
But the plan, approved by an 8-7 margin, failed to receive a single vote from 
the four Republican legislators on the commission. And it was pronounced dead 
on arrival by lawmakers who would play key roles in steering health legislation 
through the House. 
</P>
<P>
"It is wrong, outrageous and morally repugnant" for Americans to be denied 
health care because they cannot afford it, Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV 
(D-W.Va.), chairman of the Pepper Commission, told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Other members of the commission, named for its first chairman, the late Rep. 
Claude Pepper (D-Fla.), agreed with Rockefeller that the estimated 37 million 
Americans who currently lack health insurance must be given access to 
affordable health care. 
</P>
<P>
But they split over the contentious issue of financing, with the panel's 
Republican members and one Democrat objecting to the program's huge price tag 
and the absence of a specific plan for raising the money. 
</P>
<P>
The failure to obtain bipartisan approval removes much of the potential 
political momentum from the long-awaited commission report, which had been seen 
as a possible vehicle for major reforms in the health care system. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the commission's final product will be viewed as essentially a 
Democratic document. The eight-member majority included six Democratic members 
of Congress and two public members picked by former President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration is strongly opposed to any health care plan that would 
require significant new spending and tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the commission's failure to reach a bipartisan agreement, its proposal 
is likely to intensify a growing national debate over the need for health care 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
The plan approved by a majority of the Pepper Commission calls for: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mandatory health insurance coverage for all businesses with 100 or more 
workers. Companies would be given three years to offer insurance to their 
employees or begin paying money into a public plan that would cover all those 
without private insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tax credits and subsidies for companies with fewer than 100 employees to 
encourage them to purchase insurance for their workers. After five years, any 
remaining uninsured would be covered under the public plan. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Free coverage under the public plan for uninsured pregnant women and 
children up to the age of 6 in families with income below 185% of the federal 
poverty level (currently $6,314 for a single person and $12,675 for a family of 
four). Other participants would pay premiums based on their income. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Free care for the first three months spent in a nursing home, regardless of 
age or income level. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Home care and assistance, such as bathing, dressing, and grocery shopping, 
for severely disabled persons. 
</P>
<P>
Under the commission plan, the federal government would require a basic package 
of medical and surgical benefits, including prenatal care, well-child exams and 
preventive care, to be offered under all private and public insurance plans. 
</P>
<P>
The yearly deductible would be $250 for a single person and $500 for a family. 
Patients would pay 20% of the cost of all services, with a maximum 
out-of-pocket limit of $3,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Companies currently offering health insurance to their workers could maintain 
their programs, but they would be required to match the new federal standards 
for benefits and costs. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed universal health program, which would expand coverage to the 37 
million Americans now lacking health insurance, would cost the federal 
government $66 billion a year and private businesses $20 billion, Rockefeller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The commission plan did not discuss how the money would be raised other than 
calling for a "progressive tax package, requiring a higher contribution from 
those most able to bear increased tax burdens." 
</P>
<P>
Rockefeller said the 8-7 vote for his plan was a sufficient mandate. "World 
Series (games) are won by 8 to 7," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Well folks, we have done it," Rockefeller declared as he opened the news 
conference. "(Our) recommendations will begin to transform the nature of the 
American health care system (which is) . . . in total crisis." 
</P>
<P>
But the absence of details about financing drew stinging and scornful dissents 
from a key pair of commission members, Rep. Pete Stark (D-Oakland) and Rep. 
Willis D. Gradison Jr. (R-Ohio). 
</P>
<P>
"It's a hoax," Stark said at the news conference. "The commission is stone 
silent on how they will pay for it or how much it will cost each person. 
Without a way to pay for it, it is legislatively dead before it starts." 
</P>
<P>
Gradison said $66 billion in annual expenses would cost every taxpaying 
household $750. "My constituents don't feel they are under-taxed," he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Gradison also criticized the universal nursing home benefit proposed by the 
commission. "Donald Trump, God forbid, if he needed it, could spend three 
months in a nursing home . . . at the expense of taxpayers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pepper Commission plan would take effect only if enacted by Congress. Stark 
is the chairman and Gradison the ranking Republican on the health subcommittee 
of the House Ways and Means Committee, which would handle the legislation, and 
their opposition makes favorable consideration appear unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), chairman of the parent committee, also 
summarily rejected the plan, issuing a statement indicating that he was 
"seriously disappointed" with the final product. 
</P>
<P>
The commission "worked hard," said Rostenkowski, "but when the question of 
financing arose, it ducked. That sort of evasion is unacceptable in today's 
budget climate." 
</P>
<P>
The long-term care program, providing for home-based services and 90 free days 
of nursing home care, was approved by an 11-4 vote. Both Stark and Gradison 
voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HIGHLIGHTS OF PEPPER PLAN 
</P>
<P>
The Pepper Commission, a bipartisan panel of legislators and presidential 
appointees, proposed that Congress enact an ambitious program to provide health 
insurance coverage for all Americans. The price tag would be $66 billion a year 
in federal funds and $20 billion financed by private businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Highlights of the plan include: 
</P>
<P>
Mandatory health insurance coverage for all firms with 100 or more workers. 
</P>
<P>
Subsidies and tax credits to encourage smaller firms to provide insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Coverage under a public plan for all persons without private health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Free public insurance for pregnant women and children up to 6 in poor families. 
</P>
<P>
Government-paid home care services for the severely disabled. 
</P>
<P>
Free care for the first 90 days spent in a nursing home.

President Daniel Arap Moi has banned all demonstrations in Kenya following 
anti-government riots caused by the mysterious death of Foreign Minister Robert 
J. Ouko two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators, accusing the government of trying to cover up the apparent 
murder of Ouko near his home last month, clashed with police in Nairobi and the 
western town of Kisumu before his burial last week. Local press reports said at 
least one person in Kisumu died after being beaten by riot police. 
</P>
<P>
The government, aided by British detectives, has launched an investigation to 
try to identify Ouko's killers.

INSURANCE FIRMS ACCUSED OF IGNORING 'ALL-COMERS' RULE ON SELLING POLICIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie and Atty. Gen. John K. Van de 
Kamp took separate legal actions Friday against insurance companies they 
contend are violating provisions of Proposition 103 that require them to sell 
policies to all drivers with no more than one traffic violation in the last 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
This "all-comers" provision of Proposition 103 has become the focus of 
accusations, repeated Friday by insurance agents and others at a legislative 
hearing in Los Angeles, that virtually all companies doing business in 
California are ignoring it and continuing to refuse to sell to many racial 
minorities, young people and previously uninsured drivers. Seven companies were 
mentioned in the charges Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The provision actually applies only to the 70% to 80% of the state's drivers 
who qualify for a Proposition 103 "good driver discount" by not having more 
than one traffic violation or at-fault accident. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of three major companies -- State Farm, Farmers and Allstate -- 
insisted at the hearing that two vaguely worded passages in a January "peace 
treaty" the industry made with Gillespie to put off enforcement of some 
features of Proposition 103 have given them the right to ignore the 
"all-comers" provision as well. 
</P>
<P>
They acknowledged that their companies were refusing to sell their 
lowest-priced policies of the state-required minimum liability insurance to 
many drivers they would regard as "high risks," despite these drivers' good 
records. Instead, they said, in some cases they are bumping these customers 
over to higher-priced subsidiaries at rates up to 40% higher. But they said 
this is legally justified. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these pleas, however, a Gillespie deputy who appeared at the hearing 
chaired by Assemblyman Patrick Johnston (D-Stockton), said the insurance 
commissioner does not agree that the January "peace treaty" exempted the 
companies from having to apply the "all-comers" provision. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Gillespie announced that she has issued notices of 
non-compliance to the Allstate, Chicago Insurance, Industrial Indemnity, 
California Casualty, Cal-American and Clarendon National companies giving them 
10 days to begin adhering to the provision or face a public hearing. An aide 
later said similar notices will soon be sent to State Farm and Farmers. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing procedure has been time-consuming in the past. Indications are that 
it may take Gillespie months to formally order the companies to observe the 
"all-comers" provision. Even then, her order would be subject to the usual 
legal appeals. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Van de Kamp announced that he is suing the Farmers group of 
companies on much the same grounds as Gillespie. His lawsuit, however, may take 
less time to get results because it is possible the attorney general can get a 
temporary court injunction ordering Farmers to adhere to the provision. 
</P>
<P>
Also during the Johnston hearing, the Personal Insurance Federation of 
California announced that it and three major companies, State Farm, Farmers and 
Safeco, will soon propose that the Legislature authorize them to sell a 
$180-a-year "basic compensation benefits" auto insurance policy throughout the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Dan C. Dunmoyer, vice president of the group, said the policy would be designed 
to satisfy the state's minimum requirement for auto insurance and make it 
affordable. 
</P>
<P>
The policy would give buyers up to $15,000 individual or $60,000 group coverage 
from their own insurers in the case of auto accidents, and they would not be 
required to carry any liability insurance as they are now. However, the policy 
would leave such buyers exposed to being sued by others. 
</P>
<P>
The policy's annual $180 cost would be guaranteed until Oct. 1, 1991, but would 
then be allowed to rise if the companies selling it were losing money on it. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston, who is chairman of the Assembly Insurance Committee, dismissed the 
announcement as having little immediate significance. He said that Friday 
marked the last day that new legislation could be introduced in Sacramento 
during this year's legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
However, Dunmoyer pointed out that there is still plenty of time to amend the 
proposal into bills already pending.

Drug dealers placed a $10,000 price on the head of feisty anti-drug crusader 
C.W. Roddy, who has waged a high-profile war against pushers in her 
crime-ridden neighborhood, the FBI said Friday. 
</P>

An underworld "contract" was put out on the life of Roddy after she received 
national publicity for her one-woman war against dealers, FBI Agent William

Roddy, 60, a retired telephone company worker, said she would not be

HIGH COURT TO REVIEW LEGALITY OF TAX INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a far-reaching test of the voters' power to raise taxes, the state Supreme 
Court has agreed to review the constitutionality of Proposition 99, the 
landmark tobacco tax initiative passed in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The justices said they will hear an appeal by a Glendale tobacco distributing 
and wholesaling firm that contends that the measure violates provisions of 
Proposition 13 prohibiting "any" new state tax without approval of two-thirds 
of both houses of the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The high court, in a brief order filed Thursday and signed by all six 
participating justices, said it will review a ruling last December by a state 
Court of Appeal upholding the legality of the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
The justices did not set a date for a hearing, but they are expected to resolve 
the issue quickly because of the hundreds of millions of dollars in annual 
revenues at stake and the broad implications of the case for future attempts to 
raise taxes by statutory initiative. For example, backers of the 
"nickel-a-drink" increased tax on alcoholic beverages hope to place their 
initiative on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 99, approved by 58% of the electorate, imposed on wholesalers and 
distributors a 25-cents-a-pack tax increase on cigarettes and tax hikes on 
other tobacco products. The initiative, in an era of scarce revenues, is 
expected to generate about $600 million a year for state health, educational 
and environmental programs. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the tobacco firm in the case, Kennedy Wholesale Inc., argue that 
the voters lack authority to enact a statutory tax increase in the face of 
constitutional limits on new taxes imposed under Proposition 13, the 1978 
property tax-reduction initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Company attorneys also claim that the tobacco tax measure, by providing funds 
for some programs they say are not really related to smoking, violates 
constitutional provisions limiting initiatives to a "single subject." 
</P>
<P>
State lawyers respond that Proposition 13's restrictions were intended only to 
limit the Legislature's taxing powers and not to intrude on the long-held 
initiative powers of the voters. All of the tobacco measure's provisions are 
reasonably related to countering the wide-ranging problems resulting from 
smoking -- and thus do not violate the "single-subject" rule, the state says. 
</P>
<P>
State Deputy Atty. Gen. Floyd D. Shimomura refused Friday to view the high 
court's action as a signal that it disagrees with the appeals court ruling 
upholding the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel fairly confident that the Supreme Court is going to uphold the tobacco 
tax and the people's right to increase revenues through the initiative 
process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shimomura said also that even if the initiative is invalidated, it was not 
assured that all tobacco distributors would be entitled to refunds of taxes 
already paid. Unlike Kennedy Wholesale Inc., most such firms did not file 
protests when they paid their taxes, and thus might not be eligible for any 
refunds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn B. Kuhl of Los Angeles, an attorney representing the Kennedy firm, 
declined comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative took effect on Jan. 1, 1989, and two days later, Kennedy paid an 
increased tax of $50,510.49, and simultaneously filed for a refund with the 
State Board of Equalization. The board denied the request and the firm filed 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
The Court of Appeal, in its ruling Dec. 14, held that Proposition 13 was not 
intended to repeal the voters' right to enact statewide tax increases by 
statutory initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"If the people had wanted to abrogate their right of statutory initiative in 
this area or to impose upon themselves a (two-thirds) majority requirement, we 
are confident that they would have expressly done so," Appellate Justice Rodney 
Davis wrote in an opinion joined by Justices Robert K. Puglia and Frances 
Newell Carr. "The enactment of the tobacco initiative was well within the power 
of the electorate."

2 ARRESTED IN $500,000 SCHOOL VANDALISM CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies arrested a Lancaster man and a 
16-year-old youth Friday in connection with an arson and vandalism rampage that 
caused more than $500,000 in damage to a Lancaster elementary school this week. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Ivan Smith, 21, was being held at the Antelope Valley Sheriff's Station 
on suspicion of arson, vandalism and burglary. He was being held without bail 
pending a judge's decision on a request by deputies for $300,000 bail. 
Sheriff's arson investigator Dan Watters said he requested the high bail 
because of the extent of the damage and because of information that Smith and 
the youth had planned to flee to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
The juvenile was being held at Sylmar Juvenile Hall pending a court appearance 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The two confessed to breaking into Sierra Elementary School shortly before 3:26 
a.m. Wednesday, setting a fire that gutted three classrooms and smashing 
computers and televisions with a hammer, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects, who live near the school, said they had been drinking and decided 
to vandalize the school as they walked back to Smith's house from a convenience 
store, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were mad about the way things were going in their lives," Watters said. 
"They said they decided it would be a good way to take vengeance on society." 
</P>
<P>
Smith is unemployed and the juvenile, who described himself as a carpenter, is 
a dropout who lives with a relative and whose mother lives in Arizona, Watters 
said. Neither appear to have any connection to the school, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The two were arrested at Smith's home about 11:30 a.m. Wednesday, Watters said. 
He would not say how the two were identified except that an informant had 
helped. 
</P>
<P>
Watters said a hammer and clothes stained by the same type of glue that was 
poured around the school were recovered as evidence at the time of the arrest. 
The debris at the school was spattered with blood. Watters said both suspects 
had cuts on their hands. He said Smith told investigators that the bloodstains 
resulted because he was swinging the hammer with a bloody hand. 
</P>
<P>
The estimate of arson and vandalism damage, originally $325,000, has been 
increased to more than $500,000, authorities said.

NURSE GUILTY IN ROOMMATE'S MURDER FOR INSURANCE MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA KLEIN LERNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 42-year-old nurse faces the death penalty after being convicted Friday of 
hiring a co-worker to murder her roommate and mutilate his body in a scheme to 
collect on a $100,000 mortgage insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
A Van Nuys Superior Court jury deliberated for five days before finding Maureen 
McDermott guilty of first-degree murder in the April 28, 1985, death of Stephen 
Eldridge. The jury also convicted McDermott of attempted murder in a failed 
effort to kill him on March 21, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
McDermott flinched and put her hand to her forehead as the verdict was 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
McDermott, who works at County-USC Medical Center, faces the death penalty or 
life in prison without possibility of parole because the jury found that she 
was guilty of the special circumstances allegations -- lying in wait and 
killing for financial gain. Judge Alan B. Haber ordered jurors to return on 
March 19 for the penalty phase of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Eldridge, 27, was stabbed 44 times and his penis was cut off. His body was 
discovered in the Van Nuys home he shared with McDermott after she called the 
911 emergency line to report that three intruders had knocked her unconscious 
as she took a bath, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Katherine Mader. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators grew suspicious of McDermott because her injuries were minor, 
expensive items in plain view in the house had been left untouched and the bath 
water was still tepid hours after she said she had been attacked, Mader said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, they discovered that Eldridge had been injured in a knife attack 
by two intruders in the house barely a month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Mader contended that McDermott set up the killing and faked her own injuries so 
she could collect on a mortgage insurance policy that she and Eldridge took out 
when they became co-owners of a house on Killion Street in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
McDermott hired James Flores Luna, a hospital orderly, to kill Eldridge and 
mutilate his body in hopes of making it look like a homosexual crime of 
passion, which she thought would be less likely to be thoroughly investigated 
by police, Mader said. 
</P>
<P>
Luna, 36, was the key witness in the trial, which began in October. Also 
testifying against McDermott were Marvyn and Dondell Lee, brothers from Los 
Angeles who helped with the killing, according to prosecutors. The two received 
immunity in exchange for testifying. 
</P>
<P>
Luna pleaded guilty to murder with special circumstances after being promised 
that prosecutors would not seek the death penalty against him if he cooperated. 
His sentencing is pending. 
</P>
<P>
McDermott's two court-appointed attorneys, Joe Ingber and Carl Burkow, told the 
jury that police did a shoddy investigation, and they attacked the credibility 
of Luna and the Lee brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors alleged that after the March 21 attempt on Eldridge's life -- which 
McDermott herself arranged -- McDermott comforted him while secretly plotting 
to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
Eldridge confided to a friend that he felt far more secure when McDermott was 
home with him, Mader said.

60 STUDENTS WALK OUT OF CLASSES OVER DRESS CODE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Antelope Valley high school students, who boycotted classes and attacked a 
sheriff's patrol car Thursday to protest an anti-gang dress code, staged 
another class walkout Friday and said they were organizing a major protest 
before the school board next week. 
</P>
<P>
About 60 students at Antelope Valley High School in Lancaster held a peaceful 
two-hour morning class boycott. School officials and sheriff's deputies 
persuaded them to disperse, warning of suspensions and arrests if they refused. 
</P>
<P>
Most returned to class, but some went home with parents. School officials said 
they were considering disciplinary action against the students for skipping 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at Quartz Hill High School, where a student was arrested Thursday 
for threatening a teacher when his cap was confiscated, at least six students 
were suspended Friday for attempting to organize a class boycott, school 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
At Palmdale High School, the scene of a walkout Thursday, students passed out 
leaflets Friday calling for a weekend "strategy meeting" to prepare a major 
protest before the school board at its meeting next Wednesday, demanding that 
the code be revoked or revised. 
</P>
<P>
The trustees of the Antelope Valley Union High School District voted last month 
to impose the dress code to fight gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's student demonstration and the larger ones Thursday -- by about 200 
students at Antelope Valley High and 200 at Palmdale High -- were the first in 
the district in at least a decade, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations erupted Thursday when school officials began enforcing the 
dress policy. 
</P>
<P>
During the Thursday protest at Antelope Valley High School, a crowd of about 
200 students, some throwing rocks, rushed the patrol car of a sheriff's 
sergeant and forced him to flee. The deputy was questioning several suspected 
adult gang members just outside the campus in an unrelated action, but the 
students apparently thought he had detained other demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, students who said they were present at the attack said they got 
caught up in the emotion of their protest, but meant no harm. 
</P>
<P>
However, sheriff's deputies said, they still plan to seek prosecution of three 
students involved in the rock-throwing, one arrested Thursday and two who were 
detained and released Friday. They face assault and other charges, deputies 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, the rapidly urbanizing Mojave Desert region has undergone a 
drastic transformation, going from a place where gangs were rarely mentioned to 
one in which gangs have become a dominant concern in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
School officials contend that the prohibition against all but official high 
school issued baseball caps, and any apparel school officials consider 
gang-related, is needed to protect students from being attacked for innocently 
wearing colors or items that provoke gang retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
Students, however, say they ought to be able to wear what they want. 
</P>
<P>
School officials portrayed the student demonstrators as a minority of 
malcontents and truants. "These are kids quite frankly who have gotten to the 
point where they aren't in school much anyway," Antelope Valley Principal 
Yvonne Healey said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But many students disagreed, saying broad student anger over the dress code 
restrictions has instead united a range of divergent campus cliques -- 
"brains," "stoners," "jocks," heavy metal devotees and even gang members -- to 
fight for a common cause. 
</P>
<P>
"On Thursday, I saw all these kids get along. That was weird," said Palmdale 
High School junior Tammy Spargo, one of the protesters. Normally, she said, 
those groups would rarely associate at school, much less protest together.

URBAN WILDLIFE PRESERVE DEDICATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN YAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cinnamon teals, sandpipers and Savannah sparrows were already bathing and 
swimming in the new wildlife preserve at Sepulveda Basin Friday morning when 
Mayor Tom Bradley led a host of officials in praising one of the state's first 
bird sanctuaries set in a populated area. 
</P>
<P>
The $1-million preserve, located in the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area in Van 
Nuys, covers 60 acres including an 11-acre man-made lake that is expected to 
attract water birds flying south for the winter. The lake was approved in 1981 
as part of the basin's master plan and is a joint project of the state 
Department of Fish and Game, the state Department of Parks and Recreation and 
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
"Residents of the city will now be able to take a short drive and discover a 
unique, tranquil wildlife area that is open each day," Bradley said at the 
dedication ceremony. "Geese and hundreds of species of birds have already found 
refuge in this natural environment. With other recreational opportunities 
available in other parts of Woodley Park, the wildlife area is a wonderful, 
exciting excursion for the whole family." 
</P>
<P>
Bordered by Burbank Boulevard and the San Diego Freeway, the Sepulveda Basin 
Wildlife Area restricts pedestrians to dirt trails. Wooden blinds allow 
visitors to watch birds without disturbing them. Saplings and rose bushes also 
have been planted in the preserve. 
</P>
<P>
Water pumped last month created a four-inch-deep pond surrounding a small 
island. About eight more inches of treated water will be added to the lake 
within two months once the water lines of the nearby Tillman Water Reclamation 
Plant are completed. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Wohlgemuth, of the Los Angeles Audubon Society, said the preserve is 
located on the migratory route of birds flying south for warmer weather. 
</P>
<P>
"It's necessary to have it here to accommodate the birds because there are so 
few places for them to sit down where it's safe," he said. "You can't have dogs 
chasing them, people fishing there. This is going to be a wintering area and 
migration stop. They have to fatten up and get their energy up. Some of them 
will stay. 
</P>
<P>
"When I come here, I like it because it's somewhat wild," he said. "It gives me 
the feeling I'm not in the city, even though you can see the skyscrapers." 
</P>
<P>
Wohlgemuth saw about 20 species of birds Friday and said a third of them would 
not have been there without the lake.

MAN CONVICTED OF ABUSE IN DEATH OF MALNOURISHED, BEDRIDDEN MOTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Thousand Oaks man has been convicted of elder abuse in a case in which he and 
his sister were accused of neglecting their bedridden mother, whom paramedics 
found malnourished with bug-infested and feces-smeared sores. She died several 
days later, in December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas McKelvey, 30, is scheduled to be sentenced March 30. He was found guilty 
of the rarely used charge -- which was invoked for the first time in Ventura 
County -- after a two-day, nonjury trial before Ventura Superior Court Judge 
Robert J. Soares. 
</P>
<P>
His sister, Theresa McKelvey, 28, pleaded guilty to the same charge last 
August. She was sentenced in December to two months in Ventura County Jail, as 
well as five years probation and 500 hours of community service. She testified 
against her brother this week, saying he offered her no help in the care of 
their mother, Dolores McKelvey, 58, who suffered from multiple sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
Both siblings were originally charged with manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter D. Kossoris said Friday he expected McKelvey to 
receive a similar, possibly lesser, sentence than his sister because he was 
less culpable. 
</P>
<P>
Kossoris said McKelvey had opposed his mother's return from a nursing home and 
agreed only to cook and clean the house for her and his 88-year-old 
grandmother, while his sister was supposed to take care of their mother's 
hygiene. 
</P>
<P>
McKelvey said he discovered his mother's condition only after his sister left 
the house for a few days at Thanksgiving, 1988. He telephoned for an ambulance, 
and his mother died several days later at Los Robles Regional Medical Center.

WESTLAKE VILLAGE TO ALLOW MENORAH DISPLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Westlake Village City Council, which stirred a controversy in December by 
initially refusing to exhibit a Hanukkah menorah, has informally agreed to 
allow the display of small candelabras alongside City Hall Christmas trees, 
City Manager Larry Bagley said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bagley had asked the council to set a policy on religious and ethnic 
displays following the dispute, the decision was not put in writing, enabling 
the city to continue considering such requests on a case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
The council reached its decision by consensus Wednesday at a meeting attended 
by about 15 people, Bagley said. Each of the several speakers favored the 
display of menorahs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bagley, whose rejection of a six-foot menorah focused attention on the 
otherwise quiet, affluent community, said Friday that he will refer requests to 
the City Council for approval. Bagley has said he based his decision on the 
fact that the city's storefront headquarters had no room for the large menorah 
offered by Chabad, an Orthodox Jewish group, and that Hanukkah is not 
considered a federal holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Of the municipalities in the Los Angeles area approached by Chabad, Westlake 
Village was the only one to deny the request. The City Council later reversed 
Bagley's decision and allowed a table-top-sized menorah to be displayed next to 
the city Christmas tree. 
</P>
<P>
The American Civil Liberties Union and mainstream Jewish groups oppose the 
Chabad displays, arguing that menorahs are religious symbols. But the U.S. 
Supreme Court upheld Chabad's position in July in a landmark ruling that found 
menorahs, as well as Christmas trees, to be a secular holiday symbol. 
</P>
<P>
Bagley said the city has received only one other request since that by Chabad, 
from an atheist organization seeking a pagan exhibit for the spring equinox 
later this month. But no one from Truth Missions attended Wednesday's council 
meeting despite his invitation, Bagley said.

MAN SHOT BY DEPUTY GETS $510,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A jury awarded $510,000 Friday to a former tow truck driver from Sylmar who was 
shot and critically wounded in an altercation with an off-duty Los Angeles 
County sheriff's deputy who chased the tow truck after he saw it collide with a 
car and fail to stop. 
</P>
<P>
The judgment, announced in San Fernando Superior Court after six days of 
deliberation, was reduced from $850,000 because jurors determined that the tow 
truck driver -- John Gibbons, 24, of Sylmar -- was partly responsible. Jurors 
ordered Los Angeles County and the deputy, David Rawson, each to pay Gibbons 
$255,000, said Gibbons' attorney, Richard E. Eldred. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney who represented the deputy and the county could not be reached for 
comment Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
The December, 1984, shooting in Sylmar left Gibbons without his spleen and left 
kidney, requiring him to take antibiotics for the rest of his life to fight 
infections, Eldred said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police said after the shooting that Rawson chased Gibbons after 
seeing him flee the scene of a minor accident at the northbound Polk Street 
off-ramp of the Foothill Freeway. Police were unable to locate the driver of 
the second vehicle involved in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Gibbons stopped the truck on Foothill Boulevard, got out and walked 
toward Rawson, who police said drew a .38-caliber revolver and identified 
himself as a sheriff's deputy. Gibbons struggled with Rawson over the gun, 
which discharged once, a Sheriff's Department spokesman said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
But Eldred said that Gibbons did not try to grab the gun and that Rawson 
identified himself as a sheriff's deputy only after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Eldred said Rawson, who was assigned to the Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho in 
Castaic, should have called the California Highway Patrol to report the 
accident instead of trying to chase the driver. Gibbons worked for a company 
that had a towing contract with the CHP and could have been easily identified 
by asking company officials who were working that evening, Eldred said.

VALVANO CRITICISM EXPANDS; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: EDITORIALS, FACULTY SEEK OUSTER OF N.C. STATE COACH IN WAKE 
OF ALLEGED POINT-SHAVING INCIDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
As calls for Jim Valvano's resignation resonated throughout North Carolina 
Friday, the embattled North Carolina State basketball coach continued to 
distance himself from the point-shaving allegations swirling around his 
program. 
</P>
<P>
He also said he would give up his job if school officials thought it best. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm as angry as I've ever been in my life," Valvano told reporters at 
Raleigh-Durham International Airport after a flight from New York. "I am not 
implicated in any way in any violations from the start. I think it's time some 
of the blame be put where it belongs, on the people involved." 
</P>
<P>
The alleged point-shaving scheme is the latest -- and certainly heaviest -- 
shoe to drop on Valvano's program in a year of problems. Citing those problems, 
several newspapers in North Carolina Friday called for his ouster, as did a 
petition circulated among N.C. State faculty. 
</P>
<P>
Valvano said he wants to sit down with university officials as soon as 
possible. "I am perfectly ready to accept what the university thinks is best," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would consider waiving a clause in his contract that guarantees him 
$500,000 if he is terminated without appropriate cause, Valvano said: "Whatever 
is done is going to be fair and equitable to all parties. I consider the 
university my friend." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Valvano was combative, saying those who suggest a coach should know if 
players are shaving points are "people who have never been in that position." 
</P>
<P>
ABC News, citing unidentified sources, reported Wednesday that as many as four 
N.C. State players, including star forward Charles Shackleford, conspired to 
hold down the scores of four games in return for cash payments from a New 
Jersey contractor during the 1987-88 season. 
</P>
<P>
According to Shackleford's lawyer and agent, Sal DiFazio of Bridgewater, N.J., 
Shackleford has never shaved points, although he has admitted taking $65,000 
from two men -- one of whom was identified by ABC as the key figure in the 
point-shaving scheme -- while playing for the Wolfpack. 
</P>
<P>
Shackleford is with the New Jersey Nets in the NBA and has not commented 
publicly on the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina's State Bureau of Investigation acknowledged Thursday that its 
preliminary look into the point-shaving scheme has become a full investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Bureau officials said the investigation was initiated at the request of Wake 
County District Attorney Colon Willoughby. 
</P>
<P>
The ABC report said one of the games in question is N.C. State's four-point 
victory over Wake Forest on March 6, 1988. The Wolfpack had been favored to win 
the game by 16 points, and the player Shackleford was guarding, Ralph Kitley, 
scored a career-high 22 points. Kitley had been averaging seven points that 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Dowdy, the chief investigator for the State Bureau of Investigation, said 
the investigation probably will take "a pretty long time." He added: 
"Certainly, we're aware that certain individuals will not be cooperating with 
us." 
</P>
<P>
According to ABC, the point-shaving scheme was "masterminded" by Robert Kramer 
of Denville, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Kramer, a native of North Carolina, has admitted lending Shackleford $20,000 
over about eight months in 1988. But Kramer has denied any involvement in a 
point-shaving scheme, saying the money was to keep Shackleford out of the 
clutches of a sports agent who was pressuring him to leave school early for the 
NBA. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm from North Carolina," Kramer was quoted in the New York Times as saying, 
"and my home is very close to Charles' home. I'm a very big ACC fan, 
particularly North Carolina State. After I befriended Charles, it came to my 
attention that he had taken money from an agent to support himself and his 
family. I interceded when Charles told me he was thinking about quitting school 
after the basketball season." 
</P>
<P>
The agent has been identified as Larry Gillman of Ridgefield, Conn., a former 
head basketball coach at East Carolina University. 
</P>
<P>
ABC, quoting unidentified law enforcement authorities working on the N.C. State 
case, reported Friday that the investigation is focusing on Western Union cash 
transfers. In March of 1988, ABC reported, two transfers for $400 each were 
sent from a pharmacy in Orange, N.J., to Shackleford. Although the transfers 
identified the sender's name as George Shackleford, ABC reported that the phone 
numbers on the transfers trace to a phone paging device assigned to the 
construction company owned by Kramer. 
</P>
<P>
According to ABC, the law enforcement authorities are wondering why, if Kramer 
was simply trying to help Shackleford deal with Gillman, the money was sent 
under a fake name. 
</P>
<P>
Valvano was removed as N.C. State athletic director but allowed to continue as 
coach last year after evidence of academic irregularities and NCAA rules 
violations surfaced. The NCAA placed his program on two years' probation for 
violations that included the sale of complimentary tickets and athletic shoes 
by Wolfpack players. Valvano said he had no knowledge of the violations. 
</P>
<P>
With the point-shaving allegations coming to light, however, the pressure on 
Valvano to leave N.C. State has intensified. 
</P>
<P>
The Charlotte Observer editorialized: "For the sake of a great sport and a 
great institution, Jim Valvano has to go. Now." 
</P>
<P>
Said the Winston-Salem Journal: "For Coach Jim Valvano, it's only a matter of 
time. The game is over." 
</P>
<P>
But Larry K. Monteith, N.C. State's acting chancellor, has said he would not 
suggest that any action be taken against Valvano until a review of the 
basketball program, begun about a year ago, is completed. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is relevant to that review," Monteith said Thursday. "Obviously, I 
don't have the circumstances at the moment to ask him to step down. We will 
make no judgment until the allegations have been corroborated." 
</P>
<P>
A Milan sports newspaper, Gazzetta dello Sport, reported that Valvano is 
negotiating to become the coach of Phillips Milan of the Italian Basketball 
League. Tony Cappellari, the team's general manager, called the report 
"groundless." 
</P>
<P>
Valvano, in his airport talk with reporters Friday, said: "Dealing in the 
present is what my intention is, and there's no need to speculate about the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
Shackleford must deal with another matter -- his arrest Thursday night in 
Orange, N.J., on a charge of possession of a small amount of marijuana.

Maybe you've heard the radio commercial for a home security company, which uses 
a burglar as its spokesman. He tells you how to guard your home against 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
Here's the sports version:. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jamie Astaphan, who masterminded Ben Johnson's steroid program for five 
years, has volunteered to supervise drug testing at the 1992 Olympic Games. He 
suggested that his Toronto mentor, Dr. Mauro di Pasquale, assist him. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody could fool either of us," Astaphan told the Toronto Star from his home 
on the Caribbean island of St. Kitts. "I've been there. I know where it's at. I 
know where it's going." 
</P>
<P>
He no doubt can also figure out where his offer is going -- into the 
International Olympic Committee's circular file. 
</P>
<P>
Figure skater Christopher Bowman, who lost his title when he withdrew from the 
national championships because of a bad back, said this week he is 100% fit for 
next week's world championships at Halifax, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe even better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The receptionist at the Ice Castle International Training Center at Lake 
Arrowhead confirmed that Bowman has been working hard. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if Bowman could come to the telephone, she said, "He's on the ice." 
</P>
<P>
What are his practice hours? 
</P>
<P>
"All day," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent poll, 86.1% of West Germans and 85.4% of East Germans said they 
would like to see a unified German team in the 1992 Olympics. For German track 
and field athletes, that might happen as soon as next year's world 
championships in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
The president of the sport's governing body, Primo Nebiolo of Italy, is 
supporting that idea at this week's meeting of international sports leaders in 
Rome. He also is promoting Berlin -- East, West or both -- as the site of the 
1995 world championships. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Caligiuri, the midfielder who scored the goal last November that put the 
United States into this summer's World Cup in Italy, said he and the team's 
coach, Bob Gansler, resolved some of their differences after the 3-1 loss to 
the Soviet Union last Saturday at Stanford. Caligiuri had suggested that he 
didn't start because of his contract dispute with the U.S. Soccer Federation, 
to which Gansler replied that Caligiuri hasn't played well enough to start. 
"Your scrapbook can't play," Gansler said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Caligiuri, who lives in Santa Monica, said he believes he will be in the 
lineup in Italy. But he doesn't expect to be under contract. The federation 
withdrew its offer to him in January, put it back on the table a few weeks 
later and now is prepared to withdraw it again. The federation wants him to 
sign a 12-month contract with a one-year option, but he wants an escape clause 
that would allow him to join a European pro team after the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Add Soccer: Roy Wegerle, a forward for the Queens Park Rangers in the English 
first division, married an American in 1987, but the wedding came a month too 
late for him to gain his citizenship in time to play for the United States in 
the World Cup. Wegerle believed that the United States' No. 1 soccer fan, Henry 
Kissinger, would help him cut through the red tape. But a spokeswoman for 
Kissinger Associates told Newsday that the former secretary of state would not 
get involved. 
</P>
<P>
Italian Coach Azeglio Vicini, whose team has scored only one goal in its last 
five games, is under attack from Silvio Berlusconi, the television magnate who 
owns the country's best first division team, AC Milan. He said his team should 
represent the country in the World Cup instead of the national team, which has 
players from several first division clubs. Vicini responded that AC Milan would 
be merely another team if it didn't have two Dutch stars, Marco Van Basten and 
Frank Rijkaard. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Joao Havelange, the Brazilian president of the international soccer federation, 
wants to change the game from two 45-minute halves to four 25-minute quarters 
to accommodate television commercials. "Soccer is extremely professional and, 
as such, should seek all means for increasing revenues," he told a Brazilian 
newspaper, O Globo, this week. 
</P>
<P>
But that idea didn't go over in Europe. An editorial in the Dutch daily, De 
Telegraaf, suggested that Havelange was making an early April Fool's Day joke. 
In the International Herald Tribune, soccer columnist Rob Hughes called for 
Havelange to resign. "Growth at any price quickly burns itself out," Hughes 
wrote. "Such capitulation to U.S. television would not give international 
soccer a second century." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Austria, which is in the same four-team World Cup group with the United States, 
played Egypt to a scoreless tie in an exhibition game this week in Cairo. In 
Montpelier, France, West Germany lost to France, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
As indoor track and field increases in popularity in Europe, it is fading in 
the United States. Fewer than 10,000 turned out for each of the two Los Angeles 
meets this winter. Fewer than 12,000 were at Madison Square Garden for last 
week's national championships. The only meet that drew well was New York's 
Millrose Games, which reported an attendance of 16,428. But now its main 
sponsor, Panasonic, has pulled out. The company reportedly spent $500,000 a 
year on the meet. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Olympic champion and world record-holder are nice titles, but Jackie 
Joyner-Kersee should go straight to sainthood. She competed in the Millrose 
Games on a Friday night in January and was committed to another meet in 
Fairfax, Va., two days later. So she canceled a Saturday night banquet 
appearance in Milwaukee. But when she discovered that the group in Milwaukee 
never got the message, she decided to go there. She missed her flight out of 
Milwaukee and didn't arrive at her hotel in Fairfax until 1:30 a.m. Sunday. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet pole vaulter Sergei Bubka told the government he no longer needs its 
financial support. In his Ukrainian hometown of Donetsk, he is being paid very 
well to head the new Scientific and Technical Creative Center, which includes a 
sports complex and a school for pole vaulters. 
</P>
<P>
World Sports Notes 
</P>
<P>
Ben Johnson's father died of a heart attack last weekend in Falmouth, Jamaica. 
He was 65. . . . Two professional leagues, the Western Soccer League and the 
American Soccer League, have merged their business and marketing offices. But 
it will be at least a year before they begin interleague play. . . . The U.S. 
and Soviet national basketball teams have agreed to play an exhibition game in 
the United States on Aug. 4 before going to Argentina for the world 
championships. Neither team is expected to have NBA players. 
</P>
<P>
Figure skater Jessica Mills, the world junior champion in 1989, qualified for 
this year's Olympic Festival in short-track speedskating. Her sister, Phoebe 
Mills, a bronze medalist in gymnastics at the 1988 Olympics, has turned to 
diving. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from Salt Lake City's bid committee for the 1998 Winter Olympics 
didn't like suggestions that poor attendance for the national figure skating 
championships in their city hurt their candidacy. But they acknowledged that 
they need to do a better job of helping organizers promote their events. Figure 
skating is usually not a hard sell. . . . The IOC will meet in Athens today to 
discuss that city's bid for the 1996 Olympics. Terrorism will be one of the 
topics. A terrorist group recently claimed responsibility for stealing two 
bazookas from Greece's national war museum.

TRUMP JOINS FIGHT OVER RIGHTS TO A TITLE DEFENSE BY DOUGLAS 
</P>

<P>
Donald J. Trump filed a $50-million lawsuit against the Mirage Hotel and Casino 
Friday, claiming unlawful interference by the Las Vegas resort with Trump 
Plaza's contractual right to be the site of a heavyweight championship rematch 
between Buster Douglas and Mike Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
John J. Barry, one of Trump's attorneys, said his client and promoter Don King 
agreed on a rematch Feb. 12, two days after Douglas won the title with a 
10th-round knockout in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
The rematch would have taken place June 18 in Atlantic City, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
King, who claims to have promotional rights to Douglas' next three fights, has 
also filed suit against the Mirage, which wants to promote a fight between 
Douglas and No. 1 contender Evander Holyfield in September. Barry said he hoped 
both the Trump and King suits could be consolidated for purposes of a quick 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
"Trump's position is he has a contract with King for June 18 and at the time it 
was signed, King had the rights because of an exclusive contract to promote 
Douglas' next fight. 
</P>
<P>
"If Douglas has a contract with King and King has a contract with Trump, the 
Mirage is interfering with Trump's contract." 
</P>
<P>
Trump's suit, filed in U.S. District Court in New York, seeks an injunction 
against the Mirage and, if the rematch continues to be interfered with, 
punitive and compensatory damages in excess of $50 million. Douglas and his 
manager, John Johnson, were also named as defendants.

TUCKER SAYS HE EARNED DOUGLAS VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tony Tucker, the last man to beat Buster Douglas, says he wasn't surprised that 
Douglas beat Mike Tyson in Tokyo last month. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker, who stopped Douglas in the 10th round of a 1987 International Boxing 
Federation championship fight in Las Vegas, also said he is irritated by media 
descriptions of that fight in the aftermath of Douglas-Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
"The media has been writing that Buster 'just ran out of gas suddenly' against 
me and blew it," Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not how it happened. I hurt Buster early in the ninth round with a long 
right hand, and after that he started backing up. I caught him on the ropes 
with four good shots in the 10th and finished him. He was in great shape that 
night, I just wore him down and beat him." 
</P>
<P>
After Tucker beat Douglas, he lost his title to Tyson on a 12-round decision, 
his only defeat in 37 fights. Tucker, still the last man to go the distance 
against Tyson, dropped out of sight after that bout. He battled substance abuse 
and other personal problems for more than two years and is 2-0 since a 
comeback. 
</P>
<P>
He will fight Mike Evans at the Forum Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson remains the hardest hitter Tucker has faced. 
</P>
<P>
"Tyson hit me harder than anyone, certainly harder than Buster," Tucker said. 
"But Eddie Lopez hit me harder than Buster, too. Tyson was ready for a fall. 
Buster was the right guy at the right time. All it took was a guy who could 
stand up to him and fight him. I'm the one who showed he wasn't invincible, not 
Buster." 
</P>
<P>
Tucker, who stunned Tyson with a left uppercut in the first minute of their 
fight, was never in serious difficulty but still lost a clear decision. Later, 
he said he had fought Tyson with a broken bone in his right hand. 
</P>
<P>
If Steve Wynn's proposed deal to match Douglas and Evander Holyfield in 
September survives the courts, Tucker won't pick a winner. Not yet, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a tough one to pick, because it won't be for seven months," he said. 
"It depends a lot on whether or not Buster stays in shape -- you know Holyfield 
will show up in shape. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember, Buster was fighting every other month going into the Tyson fight. 
Now he's going to have a long layoff. And Holyfield took a lot of shots in his 
last two, against (Michael) Dokes and (Alex) Stewart. Holyfield takes a great 
shot, but Buster hits pretty good. If Buster can hit Holyfield as steadily as 
those two guys did, he'll knock Holyfield out." 
</P>
<P>
And what of Tyson? 
</P>
<P>
"He's young, it's hard to say. Maybe he can pick himself up after that loss, I 
don't know. You don't know what his mind is like. Psychologically, the loss by 
itself has to change him, knowing he's not invincible like he thought he was. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew Mike would take Buster lightly, so I wasn't surprised at what happened. 
Buster did it perfectly, kept that big jab on him, put pressure on him and 
didn't let Mike back him up. Buster's got a really good jab, but it can be 
countered. Buster's at his best when he's got both feet planted, throwing 
shots." 
</P>
<P>
But please, Tucker said, no more "Buster-ran-out-of-gas-against-Tucker" 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
"I hurt Buster and then finished him, he didn't run out of gas," he reiterated. 
</P>
<P>
J.D. McCauley, Buster Douglas' uncle/trainer, says he is convinced his man beat 
Tyson at his best. 
</P>
<P>
"I've watched it a half-dozen times and I've watched Mike carefully," he said. 
"I don't see Mike breathing hard at any time up to the later rounds. To me, he 
looks like he was in great shape." 
</P>
<P>
McCauley, who has insisted that he never doubted Douglas would defeat Tyson, 
said his confidence reached a peak after a morning run that Douglas took five 
days before the fight. 
</P>
<P>
"Buster ran five miles that morning in 37 minutes and felt so good when it was 
over, he ran another 2 1/2 miles," McCauley said. "We knew then Buster was in 
the best shape of his life, that if he lost, it wouldn't be because he wasn't 
in shape. 
</P>
<P>
"After the run that morning, he said to us: 'I got it, I'm gonna kill him.' 
</P>
<P>
"So he had it from both directions, heart and conditioning. Heart is directly 
related to conditioning. If you're not in shape, it won't matter if you have 
the heart." 
</P>
<P>
Douglas hasn't been near a gym since the fight, but not to worry, his trainer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as Buster doesn't go over 240-242, I'm not worried. He can take that 
off easily. But he knows if he goes up to 250-255, that's trouble." 
</P>
<P>
You wonder what kind of calls the trainer of a 42-1 shot gets after his guy 
wins the world heavyweight championship. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't heard from any name fighters, but I heard from four amateur kids," 
he said. "They wanted to go into training right away, but none of them had any 
idea how hard it is to box. So I sent them to an amateur coach." 
</P>
<P>
The name jumps out from the long roster of entrants in Sunday's Los Angeles 
Marathon: Palomino, Carlos. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my seventh marathon and my third L.A. Marathon," the former welterweight 
champion said. Palomino, 40 but still at his fighting weight of 147 pounds, 
said running a marathon is a lot more painful than going the distance with 
Roberto Duran or Armando Muniz. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I ran a marathon, I thought the first 15 miles were a breeze," 
he said. "But after 18 miles, every step felt like a body shot from George 
Foreman. After my fights with Duran and Muniz, I hurt from the waist up for 
several days. After a marathon, I hurt from the waist down for two weeks. And I 
can't walk without making faces." 
</P>

Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson visited the scene of one of his 
early victories this week, the old brick arena in Helsinki, Finland, where he 
won the Olympic middleweight gold medal in 1952. Patterson and his pro rival, 
Ingemar Johansson, were guests at the recent Finnish amateur boxing 
championships. . . . One of the best of a good current crop of 
light-heavyweights, Australian Jeff Harding (15-0) will defend his WBC 
championship against Nestor Giovanni (28-4-2) of Argentina March 18 on ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
According to an Amateur Athletic Foundation study, Sugar Ray Leonard was easily 
the best-paid athlete in 1989, at $29.5 million. Mike Tyson was a distant 
second with $14 million, followed by Thomas Hearns with $11 million and Roberto 
Duran with $8.165 million. The first non-boxer on the list: Auto race driver 
Ayrton Senna with $8 million. . . . The Dunes in Las Vegas will stage its first 
boxing show since 1983 on March 12, featuring a lightweight bout between Greg 
Haugen (23-2-1) and Memo Cruz (17-3). 
</P>
<P>
NBC boxing coordinator Kevin Monaghan said the network will no longer recognize 
the World Boxing Assn., after the WBA's featherweight champion, Antonio 
Esparragoza, pulled out of an April 1 bout against Steve Cruz, which was to 
have been televised by NBC. Monaghan, angry because he lost the date to a 
figure skating show, claimed that the pullout was payback for a long-running 
NBC-WBA beef. . . . Mike Evans, who will be Tony Tucker's Forum opponent 
Thursday night, is a part-time actor and former amateur wrestler who lost to 
Olympic champion Tyrell Biggs in Biggs' first pro bout in 1984.

NEW YORK'S FRED LEBOW IS IN HOSPITAL AWAITING BIOPSY RESULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of all his storied fights and battles, this is surely Fred Lebow's toughest. 
The feisty race director of the New York Marathon -- the man who invented 
big-time marathons -- is today in a New York hospital, awaiting the results of 
a biopsy on a growth removed from his head. 
</P>
<P>
Lebow said it all began about a month ago when, typically, he was running. 
</P>
<P>
"I was abroad at a marathon," he said this week from his hospital room. "I 
usually run an eight- or nine-minute pace. All of a sudden, I was doing a 
12-minute pace. It was hard to run. I thought, OK, no big deal. Then I went to 
Belgrade and I was jogging. I was so slow. I figured it was all the traveling. 
</P>
<P>
"I came back to New York and went jogging in Central Park. Same thing. I didn't 
pay much attention to it." 
</P>
<P>
Then, two weeks ago at a banquet, Lebow was introducing people he had known for 
quite a while and mixing up their names. Something was wrong, but he didn't 
know what. Without telling him, friends of Lebow's made a doctor's appointment. 
A CAT scan showed a cyst or growth on his brain. He was immediately 
hospitalized. Last Monday, part of the growth was removed. Results are expected 
by early next week. 
</P>
<P>
Lebow, 52, has refused to slow down. He began a running program on the roof of 
the hospital. After the operation, he was slowed to a walk, which he does for 
an hour in the corridor each day. His room is filled with flowers and cards, 
and Lebow has been visited or called by scores of athletes whose careers have 
crossed with his. 
</P>
<P>
It has been the source of much comfort to him. 
</P>
<P>
"Mary Decker came by today," he said. "Bill Rodgers called. The people at the 
London Marathon called. I hate to be in the hospital, but I am going to fight 
this. Besides, from my window I can see all the races in Central Park." 
</P>
<P>
In town for the Los Angeles Marathon but not running it is Mexican 
middle-distance star Jesus Herrera, who was second in the 1988 race. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera will run in the 5K race, which is affiliated with the marathon and is 
being staged for the first time. More than 2,000 runners are expected to take 
part. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera repeats the same sad story that other Mexican athletes have told over 
the years, that of little official support and some official intervention. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera said that if sports officials don't want an athlete to compete abroad, 
they simply don't grant permission to leave the country. He said that to avoid 
such a situation, he didn't tell anyone he would be running here. 
</P>
<P>
"I just got on a plane," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a country that has bred some of the sport's most talented runners, it is 
disheartening to hear that the problems persist. Herrera said if athletes 
inquire about information on improved diets or training methods, officials 
ignore them. 
</P>
<P>
Big Brother Is a Watch: A new sports timing system will be tested in this 
year's L.A. Marathon, and it may well be the shape of things to come. About 340 
runners will be equipped with a timing device that, its developers say, will 
provide instant and accurate timing information -- not only after the race but 
also during the race. 
</P>
<P>
The Time Tag system calls for a runner to wear a specially designed device 
strapped to one wrist, programmed to identify the runner according to entry 
number. The device emits a radio signal that is received as runners pass by 
antennae, placed at various points along the course. The information is 
processed and is supposed to provide instant race splits and updates. 
</P>
<P>
The system has been used in the Ironman Triathlon and some other events but 
never in a marathon. Twenty entrants in the Friendship Cup race -- which 
consists of national teams -- will test the devices. In addition, 320 students 
from the Southland will wear them. 
</P>
<P>
Running Notes 
</P>
<P>
Olympic sprinter Florence Griffith Joyner, who retired from the sport last 
fall, announced that she has taken up marathon running and hopes to compete in 
the 1996 Olympics in her new discipline. "I have the dream of running the 
marathon because I just love running," she told a group in Melbourne. "I'll go 
out and just run and run and run along the roads. I love the fact of running . 
. . The Bolder Boulder race in May has been selected as the 1990 TAC national 
women's 10K championship . . . The Goodwill Games marathon team will be 
selected based on performances from last Sept. 30 through March 18. The 1990 
men's national marathon championship will be held at Columbus, Ohio, on Nov. 
11. Yet to be determined are the qualifying races for the World Championships 
in Tokyo next year . . . Qualifying standards have been set for the Olympic 
trials marathon: 2:20 or better for men and 2:45 or better for women. . . . Two 
of marathon running's top women -- Joan Benoit Samuelson and Ingrid Kristiansen 
-- will not run this season. Each is expecting her second child.

THEY WON'T BE FORGOTTEN AT GONZAGA; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: BROTHERS BRYCE AND JIM MCPHEE MADE THEIR MARKS IN 
CONSECUTIVE CAREERS SPANNING 10 YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a West Coast Conference dominated by fifth-year seniors -- Hank Gathers, Bo 
Kimble and Tom Lewis among them -- the best little-known basketball player for 
the last decade has been named McPhee. 
</P>
<P>
But after Gonzaga plays at 2 p.m today against Loyola Marymount in the opening 
round of the West Coast Conference tournament at Gersten Pavilion, the name 
McPhee probably won't appear in a Bulldog box score again, after having been 
there since the 1980-81 season. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean that 6-foot-5 guard Jim McPhee has played the longest career 
in NCAA history; merely that he and older brother Bryce McPhee have had 
consecutive five-year careers. 
</P>
<P>
At the tournament coaches' luncheon Friday, WCC Commissioner Michael Gilleran 
jokingly asked Gonzaga Coach Dan Fitzgerald, "Any more McPhees coming? We hear 
rumors about cousins or an uncle." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzaga has already signed Bryce McPhee's infant son to a gag letter of intent. 
</P>
<P>
Jim McPhee, averaging 23.3 points and within 17 of 2,000 for his career, is 
playing on a sore knee but undoubtedly will lead the Bulldog offense in what, 
barring a major upset, will be his last collegiate game. He scored 42 points in 
each of the two games game against Loyola this season. 
</P>
<P>
"His knee is not very good, but he's gotta play and he'll find a way," 
Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Coach Paul Westhead said: "We're going to try to keep him in the low 
40s." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, McPhee was named to the all-conference team for the third time and 
was named a first-team Academic All-American -- a distinction Bryce also 
earned. McPhee, who already has one degree, is taking graduate courses in 
communication and has a 3.3 grade-point average. He and his brother have 
combined for five all-conference selections. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald says the McPhees fit the "Gonzaga guy" image along with another 
former Bulldog, John Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
"They're out of the same mold," Fitzgerald said. "If Jimmy's what a Gonzaga guy 
is, I'm proud of that. I appreciate that he's our all-time scorer, but I 
appreciate him even more for things other than basketball. We've given him a 
lot, but he's given an awful lot back to us." 
</P>
<P>
The McPhees' Gonzaga connection started when Fitzgerald recruited Bryce at 
Bellarmine Prep in Tacoma. Jay Hillock, now an assistant coach at Loyola who 
helped recruit both McPhees while at Gonzaga, said Bryce's signing was almost 
an afterthought. 
</P>
<P>
A good all-around athlete and leaper at 6-3, he played center in high school 
and was not heavily recruited. 
</P>
<P>
"Lenny Wilkens (then coach of the Seattle SuperSonics) called me over the 
summer and said McPhee was the best player in his camp. He was beating college 
guys," Hillock said. "So we gave him a scholarship. If we hadn't, he was going 
to walk on at Santa Clara. (Now) they're kind of an institution up there." 
</P>
<P>
Bryce McPhee, who improved rapidly as a swing man, was often the recipient of 
assists from Stockton, another little-known Washington native who was in his 
recruiting class. But where Stockton went on to NBA stardom with the Utah Jazz, 
McPhee suffered a devastating knee injury that cost him the 1983-84 season. 
</P>
<P>
He finished his career with 1,060 points but thoughts of a pro career were 
gone. He is now back at his alma mater in Tacoma, coaching the junior varsity 
and working on a master's degree in physical therapy. When Stockton went to the 
NBA, he called Bryce McPhee the best athlete he had played with or against. 
</P>
<P>
But Gonzaga barely missed a beat, the younger McPhee replacing his brother the 
next season, despite some misgivings about being compared to Bryce. They are 
different types of players as well as individuals, but Fitzgerald said there is 
a common thread of competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
"Bryce was a tremendous athlete, one of the best we've ever had," Fitzgerald 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim is a great shooter, more limited in some ways. He's probably achieved more 
for his ability than any kid I've been around. Bryce could play above the rim. 
Jim's a competitor." 
</P>
<P>
Hillock said, "I think Jimmy was more ready to play immediately, but he didn't 
have the massive improvement Bryce did. 
</P>
<P>
"Jimmy's more limited as an athlete, but he's probably the best pure shooter in 
our conference." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald said the Bulldogs' last-place finish in the WCC (3-11, 8-19 overall) 
showed how tough the younger McPhee is. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been a great competitor, maybe even more this year," Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
"He is as good a kid and as good a competitor as he appears. He's a tough guy 
that gets it done." 
</P>
<P>
After winning all-conference honors as a sophomore, McPhee suffered a torn knee 
ligament before his junior season. He was granted an injury hardship by the 
NCAA for that season. 
</P>
<P>
He returned for 1988-89 and averaged 20 points on 59% shooting. He began this 
season shooting 54% from the field and 88% from the foul line, numbers he has 
maintained as a senior despite being the focus of most defenses. 
</P>
<P>
How would the McPhees fare against one another? 
</P>
<P>
"That would be a great fight," Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody would have to die to win that fight." 
</P>
<P>
WCC Notes 
</P>
<P>
Postseason honors were named, with Loyola Marymount dominating as it did the 
league. Bo Kimble was named player of the year and Lion Coach Paul Westhead was 
coach of the year. Also, Loyola's Hank Gathers and Jeff Fryer were named to the 
All-WCC team. Other members included: Jeffty Connelly, Santa Clara; Craig 
Davis, Dexter Howard and Geoff Lear, Pepperdine; Joel DeBortoli, San Francisco; 
John Jerome, San Diego; Josh Lowery, Portland; and Jim McPhee, Gonzaga . . . 
Matt Houle of Portland was named freshman of the year.

former state official for their roles in the Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
The state bar confirmed Friday that it is looking into the conduct of 
gubernatorial fund-raiser Karl M. Samuelian, Corporations Commissioner 
Christine W. Bender and Franklin Tom, a former corporations commissioner who 
now is a member of Samuelian's Los Angeles law firm. 
</P>
<P>
News of the the probe ironically comes just a day after Bender's department 
filed suit against Irvine-based Lincoln's former parent and three of its 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
Fran Bassios, the bar's deputy chief trial counsel, said staff lawyers 
initiated the probe in November after reading newspaper stories that raised the 
possibility of ethical wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
He said the staff must review transcripts of various testimony before it 
decides whether sufficient evidence exists to continue the probe and question 
the three lawyers. The probe could end with the review. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll move as quickly as we can on the investigation," Bassios said. 
</P>
<P>
Among those funding Deukmejian's political campaigns was Charles H. Keating 
Jr., chairman of Lincoln's parent firm, American Continental Corp. in Phoenix. 
A heavy contributor to state and federal campaigns, Keating and his family and 
business associates gave Deukmejian $150,000 for his 1986 reelection and gave 
the state Republican Party $100,000 -- through Samuelian. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental had hired Samuelian's law firm to process its applications 
for public offerings of subordinated debentures, which are essentially 
corporate IOUs. 
</P>
<P>
Tom approved one bond sale in late 1986 before quitting his state post and 
rejoining his former law firm, Parker, Milliken, Clark, O'Hara &amp; Samuelian. 
Bender, who also came from the Samuelian firm, approved the next offering in 
May, 1988, after her agency extensively reviewed American Continental's 
request. 
</P>
<P>
Samuelian and Tom met with Bender several times to counter information her 
agency had developed on American Continental's apparent inability to repay the 
debt that it wanted to issue. In the end, the department approved the offering 
for sale, basing its decision on a clean bill of financial health from American 
Continental's outside accounting firm and on assurances from Parker Milliken 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
About 22,000 small investors bought nearly $200 million in company debentures 
mainly at Lincoln's 29 Southern California branches. Those bonds became nearly 
worthless when American Continental filed for bankruptcy protection last April 
and regulators seized Irvine-based Lincoln the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Bender said she was unaware of the state bar probe but welcomed investigators' 
review of any of her testimony before state committees or any Corporations 
Department records. She said she had not violated any ethical rules in her 
actions involving the approval process for the bond sales. 
</P>
<P>
Seth Aronson of Los Angeles, a lawyer for Samuelian and Tom, said his clients 
did not violate any ethical rules. He said that the state bar hasn't notified 
his clients about any investigation and that he was "deeply concerned" that the 
bar apparently breached confidentiality provisions that are part of any 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"A state bar lawyer I spoke with (Friday) could not even identify for us any 
particular bar rules that might have been violated," Aronson said. 
</P>
<P>
If ethical rules are violated, the bar can recommend a number of sanctions, 
including the revocation of a lawyer's license to practice law. 
</P>
<P>
The state Corporations Department, meanwhile, has gone on the offensive with a 
securities fraud lawsuit against American Continental, Keating and two of his 
top executives. The suit seeks restitution for bondholders and an injunction 
from further state securities law violations. 
</P>
<P>
The agency claims that its staff and other state and federal regulators were 
victims, along with debenture holders, of a "colossal deception." Keating and 
others "masterminded a carefully concealed campaign of fraud and deceit" that 
robbed thousands of Californians and others of their money, Bender said in a 
press conference Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But American Continental said Bender's charges are nothing new.

ONCE A COMER IN PCS, KAYPRO FILES UNDER CHAPTER 11 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Kaypro Corp., once synonymous with portable personal computers but hobbled in 
recent years by a long string of misfortunes, has filed for protection under 
Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code. 
</P>
<P>
The Solana Beach-based firm, which will continue to operate and sell computers, 
is a victim of highly competitive market conditions, faulty components that led 
to costly warranty repairs and ongoing management problems. Its bankruptcy 
filing comes only two weeks after it named management consultant Roy Y. 
Salisbury as chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by its once-popular portable Kaypro personal computer, the firm's sales 
skyrocketed to $119.6 million in 1984 from $5.5 million in 1982. But it has 
since been buffeted severely. Last month, it announced a 1989 loss of $19.4 
million on sales of $21.8 million, losses that brought its accumulated deficit 
in recent years to $44.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Kaypro's largest unsecured creditor is founder and Chairman Andrew Kay, who is 
owed $7.3 million, according to a preliminary petition filed Thursday in U.S. 
Bankruptcy Court in San Diego. As financial problems mounted and banks steered 
clear of the company, Kay lent Kaypro cash to pay some of its bills. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of the Kaypro portable computer, which was based on the now-outdated CP/M 
operating system, began to erode in the mid-1980s with the rising dominance of 
the DOS operating system incorporated in International Business Machines' 
personal computers and their clones. Kaypro replaced the old portable with new 
models using the DOS system that sold well for a while but failed to make a 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
The company is a shadow of its former self, with payroll having been whittled 
to 44 employees from 526 as of October, 1987. The company is also considering 
subleasing its Stevens Avenue plant and office facility in Solana Beach. Kaypro 
also said it is considering having its computers made offshore in the 
Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
New chief Salisbury declined to single out one factor that brought the company 
to its current straits. Over the years, the company has cited inventory 
writedowns and the high price of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips for 
its problems. 
</P>
<P>
In its bankruptcy court petition, Kaypro gave only a partial listing of 
liabilities and assets. The most complete listing available is balance sheet 
data filed with Kaypro's fiscal 1989 earnings statement that shows assets of 
$5.6 million and liabilities of $21.8 million, said Charles Clark, a consultant 
for Kaypro.

TEXAS AIR SAYS EXAMINER'S REPORT FLAWED; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: THE FIRM BLASTS THE CLAIMS THAT IT IMPROPERLY DRAINED ASSETS FROM ITS 
EASTERN AIRLINES UNIT AND SAYS IT WILL CLEAR BOTH COMPANIES' NAMES. 
</P>

<P>
Texas Air Corp. and its bankrupt subsidiary, Eastern Airlines, on Friday 
lambasted a bankruptcy examiner's report that concluded the parent company had 
improperly siphoned assets from Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
The companies said the 500-page report filed Thursday with the federal 
bankruptcy court here by examiner David I. Shapiro "contained so many errors, 
and is so fundamentally misleading that serious and considered actions will be 
taken to clear the companies' names." 
</P>
<P>
The announcement did not specify what action will be taken, but Texas Air 
spokesman Art Kent said, "We will let you know very soon exactly what we are 
going to do." 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro said in his report that Texas Air had drained as much as $403 million 
in assets from Eastern, which has been in bankruptcy proceedings for almost a 
year, without paying fair value for them. He cited 12 of 15 transactions that 
he said he had investigated. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro said, for example, that when Eastern sold its System One computer 
reservation system to the parent firm in 1987, it received far less than the 
system was worth. 
</P>
<P>
The angry response by Eastern and its parent came even though Texas Air has 
agreed to repay Eastern $280 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We were sandbagged," the two companies said Friday. "The agreement we reached 
was designed solely to continue to provide Eastern with the resources and 
revenues to complete its rebuilding as a viable airline, 100% owned by Texas 
Air. In fact, we had publicly committed months ago to provide most of these 
resources unilaterally. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead, we find ourselves in the intolerable position where our commitments 
to rebuild Eastern are being improperly used to imply that Texas Air somehow 
agrees with the totally erroneous conclusions in this slipshod, amateurish 
report, and that our assistance to Eastern somehow constitutes payment to 
settle any such liabilities." 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro, a lawyer in Washington, could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
However, a Los Angeles attorney and specialist on bankruptcies, Richard Broude, 
said Friday that he doubts that Texas Air and Eastern will formally challenge 
Shapiro's report in a court action. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite the agreement Texas Air may have entered into to avoid protracted and 
harmful litigation," he said, "their position in the bankruptcy court will be, 
'Yes, we agreed to the settlement, but we contest the examiner's facts.' " 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro asserted in his report that if Texas Air had not entered into the 
agreement, which must be approved by Bankruptcy Court Judge Burton R. Lifland, 
he would have urged the appointment of a trustee to oversee all of Eastern's 
affairs, effectively taking day-to-day operation of the airline out of the 
hands of its current managers. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern filed for bankruptcy last March 9, five days after its machinists, 
pilots and flight attendants struck. Only the machinists remain on strike. But 
because of the airline's reduced size and because it hired many non-union 
employees after the strike began, few of the pilots and flight attendants who 
struck have been able to return to their jobs.

DOLLAR AT 2 1/2-YEAR HIGH AGAINST YEN DESPITE FED'S INTERVENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The dollar closed above 150 Japanese yen for the first time in 2 1/2 years 
Friday despite repeated attempts by the Federal Reserve Board to halt the 
currency's rise. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, the dollar closed at 150.15 yen, compared to 149.85 Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
It was the dollar's highest close against the yen since Aug. 14, 1987, when it 
closed at 151.50. 
</P>
<P>
Against the West German mark, the dollar succumbed to intervention by West 
German's central bank, the Bundesbank, and closed slightly lower at 1.7150 
marks, compared to 1.7194 Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese yen has been weakening amid stock market turmoil that has caused 
money to pour into dollar-denominated investments. An interest rate increase 
has been widely expected in Japan, but many traders fear that would fuel yet 
more selling on the volatile Tokyo Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed sold dollars openly in the morning and more discreetly in the 
afternoon, traders said, but the currency broke the 150-yen barrier shortly 
after noon and never looked back. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar closed slightly below its high for the day of 150.45 yen as traders 
hedged slightly before a meeting of finance officials from major industrialized 
nations to take place in Japan next week. 
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank was reported to have sold dollars at about 1.7180 marks, its 
first such action since Jan. 4. The West German currency has been hurt by 
concern over the potentially inflationary impact of unification. 
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank's move took the market somewhat by surprise, as dealers had not 
expected the West German central bank to intervene unless the dollar rose to 
1.7300. Nevertheless, the dollar closed well above its lows against the mark.

PERSONAL FINANCE: NEXT: BUYER PROTECTION FOR PURCHASES BY CHECK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Buyer protection plans, a big hit on credit card accounts, may soon become a 
popular new attraction with checking accounts as well. 
</P>
<P>
Although the plans -- a form of insurance that will replace lost, stolen or 
damaged goods purchased by check -- are nice additions, various limitations 
make them not quite as sexy as they first seem. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix-based Valley National Bank in late January became the first savings 
institution to offer such a plan, and dozens of banks are expected to follow. 
Valley National's Shoppers Assurance plan, likely to become typical, will 
replace certain merchandise bought by check that is damaged, lost or stolen, 
for 90 days after purchase and up to $50,000 a year. The plan will also double 
manufacturers' U.S. warranties, up to one additional year. 
</P>
<P>
So if you accidentally drop and break that new crystal vase or camcorder, or 
spill coffee on that new silk blouse, you'll be covered if the items were 
purchased by check. 
</P>
<P>
Similar buyer protection plans, offered to holders of American Express credit 
cards and then to holders of premium Visas and MasterCards, have become so 
popular and inexpensive to offer that holders of non-premium credit cards can 
get them as well. 
</P>
<P>
For checking accounts, such protection offers advantages to account holders as 
well as the bank or savings and loan. For account holders, it provides 
insurance protection at low or no cost; although institutions may require 
higher account balances, Valley National does not charge extra fees for the 
protection because the insurance costs them very little. 
</P>
<P>
For banks and S&amp;Ls, the plans offer a strong marketing tool and could 
induce account holders to maintain higher balances. "It sets us apart from 
anybody else," says Steve House, the bank's vice president and advertising 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the plans could become one of the most popular new enhancements 
to hit the checking account scene in years. 
</P>
<P>
"This certainly adds some promotional pizazz to a bank's advertising campaign," 
says Robert K. Heady, publisher of Bank Advertising News, a newsletter in North 
Palm Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
But before jumping for joy, you should realize that such plans -- like their 
sister versions with credit cards -- carry some important limitations. 
</P>
<P>
For one, they aren't likely to cover all purchases. Valley National's plan, for 
example, excludes such items as motor vehicles, foods or other perishables, and 
live animals, House says. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the coverage will often expire by the time you'll want to make a claim; 
many things don't break until after 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
More important, the plans will cover only those losses that aren't covered by 
homeowner's insurance or other policies. So if your television set and stereo 
are stolen from your home, your homeowner's insurance must kick in first. And 
when making a claim, you may have to prove that you've exhausted all other 
sources of insurance first -- that could be a major paper work headache. 
</P>
<P>
These plans may primarily be good to cover the deductibles on your home or auto 
insurance. Indeed, the premiums that credit card issuers have paid for the 
protection plans is low because only a small percentage of cardholders actually 
make claims. 
</P>
<P>
"The plans do have value, but not as much as promoted," says Robert B. 
McKinley, publisher and editor of RAM Research Bankcard Update, a Frederick, 
Md., service that tracks credit card services. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the availability of such a plan shouldn't be the overriding 
factor in picking a checking account. 
</P>
<P>
Look first at other basics, such as interest rates, minimum balances, monthly 
fees, per-check charges and other expenses.

MONEY TALK: DEPOSIT INSURANCE CAP INCLUDES INTEREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: Please clarify the limits on the insurance coverage at banks and 
savings and loan institutions. I have several accounts at different 
institutions, and all are less than $100,000. But what happens when compounding 
interest is added to the accounts and the amount then exceeds $100,000? I have 
also been told that if I maintain the accounts with different family members, 
my total insurance coverage increases beyond $100,000. I'm sure that with the 
unsettled condition surrounding the thrift industry these days, many must share 
my confusion. -- R. D. M. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: You are right, no doubt, about the confusion. Be advised that the rules 
governing deposit insurance are complicated, so you still might want to consult 
your branch manager for additional advice. But, in a nutshell, if interest 
accumulation puts your account over the $100,000 threshold, the amount over 
$100,000 is not covered by insurance. For this reason, experts say, many 
depositors buy certificates for $90,000 to $93,000, leaving them some margin 
for accumulating interest. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is still more to say about deposit insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, one of the biggest misunderstandings about this insurance, for both 
banks and savings and loans, is that the $100,000 limit is applied solely on a 
per-account basis. Actually, the insurance coverage is based on a somewhat 
complicated set of categories of savings accounts, and savers are limited to 
$100,000 in insurance per category of savings per institution. 
</P>
<P>
For the average saver, there are two categories of accounts: individual and 
joint. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. will insure both up to a maximum of 
$100,000 per person. But here's the deal: If, for example, you maintain -- as 
an individual -- a $5,000 checking account, a $25,000 savings account and a 
$75,000 certificate of deposit, you have exceeded your insurance limit by 
$5,000, plus any accrued interest. The lesson? If you have several accounts at 
the same institution, be sure to check in whose names the accounts are held. If 
they are all in the same individual's name and the total exceeds $100,000, you 
probably don't have the insurance coverage you thought you did. 
</P>
<P>
The rules for joint accounts are even more complicated, but the bottom line is 
that no single individual can qualify for more than $100,000 in insurance for 
accounts held jointly with others at a particular institution. For example, if 
you hold a $100,000 certificate with your spouse and two additional $100,000 
accounts with your children, you are deemed to hold half of $300,000 worth of 
joint accounts, or a total of $150,000. That puts you $50,000 over the limit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Savings Plan Sounds Better Than It Pays 
</P>
<P>
Q: In planning for my 2-year-old's eventual college education, I've come up 
with a strategy that seems to maximize tax deductions and tax-deferred income. 
I plan to take out a second mortgage on my home and put the proceeds into an 
annuity. This way I get a current tax deduction on the mortgage interest and 
tax-deferred income on the annuity. Does this make sense? -- B. B. 
</P>
<P>
A: On paper, yes. But according to our experts, your plan isn't as sound as it 
appears on paper, for two principal reasons: Interest rates on second mortgages 
are considerably higher than those paid on annuities, and state and federal 
governments charge penalties for early withdrawal of annuity funds. 
</P>
<P>
Let's explain. For starters, interest rates charged for second mortgages are 
running about 12%, while annuities are paying 8% to 9%. This spread of at least 
3 percentage points does not include the fees and closing costs charged by 
second-mortgage lenders. Further, if you take a distribution from the annuity 
before you turn 59 1/2, you face penalties of 10% from the Internal Revenue 
Service and 2.5% from the state of California. 
</P>
<P>
Even if you or your wife should turn 59 1/2 before your child needs money for 
college, our experts recommend that you look for another strategy to fund his 
or her education. One financial planner says your strategy would make sense if 
the interest rate on second mortgages was no more than 2 percentage points 
higher than what your investment would pay. But such a scenario, he notes, is 
highly unlikely. He says you would be better off investing your child's college 
fund in a growth mutual fund, double tax-free municipal bonds or real estate.

The district found that the firm -- which has produced cloyingly-sweet 
potpourri since 1981, and later incense and dyed, scented salt crystals -- was 
also emitting more than 300 pounds of volatile hydrocarbons a day. The 
emissions came from the solvent used to dye and perfume wood chips and flowers 
used in the mix. 
</P>
<P>
The neighbors complained when the factory greatly expanded. 
</P>
<P>
"When we first went out there a year ago," said David Fishel, Tulare County 
environmental health director, the solvent mix was being poured from sprinkler 
cans over chips spread out on the factory floor and in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"It was running down the driveway, into the gutter and into the storm drains," 
he said. "I'll tell you, in that neighborhood, (the odor) is downright 
unbearable. . . . I wonder why the place didn't burn up."

FIRE MARSHALS CLOSE STUDIO CITY THEATER

<TEXT>
<P>
All weekend performances of John Susman's "Tiger Treadwell Takes Tinseltown" at 
the Ventura Court Theatre in Studio City have been canceled after Los Angeles 
fire marshals closed down the theater Thursday just before the performance was 
to begin. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the shutdown, according to Capt. James L. Gaffney, was the 
theater management's failure to secure the proper licenses -- specifically a 
particular permit "that allows that kind of business to be run out of that 
occupancy." 
</P>
<P>
The newly opened theater on Ventura Boulevard has 99 seats. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd been promised since January that all the city building codes would be met 
and that we would be handed a legal building," said Carolynn Botticelli, who 
produced "Tiger Treadwell" for the Los Angeles Theatre Unit. "Twenty paying 
customers filed in last night followed by the fire marshal." 
</P>
<P>
Neither the theater's owner, Max Rubinchik, nor his legal counsel, Richard 
Niederberg, could be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Botticelli said the show would resume Thursday only if Rubinchik is able to 
secure the needed clearances. Otherwise, the show will remain closed. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone holding tickets or reservations for this weekend can reach Botticelli at 
(213) 851-8106. SYLVIE DRAKE

</P>
<P>
The series premieres in its regular time slot on Wednesday, March 28 (10-11

RICK DU BROW: RADIO'S LIMBAUGH BRINGS HIS OPINIONS TO TV; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: THE CONTROVERSIAL TALK-SHOW STAR WILL HOST PAT SAJAK'S SHOW MARCH 
30 ON CBS, THE SAME NETWORK THAT SUSPENDED ANDY ROONEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Rush Limbaugh, the controversial and outspoken radio talk show host, sees 
nothing ironic in the fact that he is getting a big opportunity to make a TV 
name for himself on CBS, the same network that suspended the outspoken Andy 
Rooney amid proven and unproven remarks that enveloped him in controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Because of their public statements, neither man is a favorite of gays. But, 
curiously, Limbaugh, who will be the guest host of CBS' late-night "Pat Sajak 
Show" March 30, may benefit from the arguments over freedom of expression that 
emerged during the furor over Rooney, who returns to "60 Minutes" Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not puzzled by CBS' decision to ask me to host," says Limbaugh. "It is, I 
think, a business decision. They're hoping I will be able to draw viewers. I 
am, too. I can tell you this: When I did the Sajak show as a guest, I'm 
gathering that they enjoyed it. I think they got a little bit of a ratings bump 
up the night I was on. And I bring a rather large radio audience to the show." 
</P>
<P>
Freedom of expression became a central issue in the Rooney affair as debate 
raged over remarks about blacks that he denied making to a gay publication, and 
also over criticism of the gay lifestyle that he admittedly had tough words for 
on TV and in print. 
</P>
<P>
Because CBS News President David Burke never did make clear precisely what 
Rooney was suspended for, and now has not made clear precisely why he is being 
reinstated after three weeks of his three-month suspension -- which surely 
everyone, including the newsman, had the right to know -- the freedom of 
expression issue has seemed to grow more and more in importance. 
</P>
<P>
From criticisms of CBS by other journalists to remarkable public support for 
Rooney in phone calls and letters, it became clear that people wanted him to 
have the freedom to speak his mind. One disturbing aspect of this is that we'll 
never how many of these calls and letters came from people who hate blacks and 
gays. Nonetheless, the clear distaste for censorship on TV was unmistakable. 
</P>
<P>
And that's where Limbaugh comes in. 
</P>
<P>
Even those who may vehemently disagree with his views on such matters as 
liberals, gays and the homeless, delivered on more than 170 radio stations 
including KFI-AM (640), may think a bit about the free-speech principle of the 
Rooney case in contemplating Limbaugh's outing on the same network. For what 
the boring arena of network TV needs is more, not fewer, strong opinions, to 
liven it up like cable. 
</P>
<P>
But Limbaugh says no one has to worry about him going off the deep end in his 
March 30 hour on CBS -- which, incidentally, should provide fascinating head-on 
competition for Johnny Carson. In a phone interview from his New York home, 
Limbaugh first of all said he found nothing ironic in being tapped to appear on 
CBS, the network that backed off on Rooney. 
</P>
<P>
"I was asked to do this before this whole flap with Rooney happened," he said. 
"If there is an irony here, they (CBS) would have to speak to it. But I think 
you're dealing with the fact that one division's entertainment, one division's 
news." 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, says Limbaugh, "We've had some discussions on what the show's gonna be, 
and there's not even gonna be a word mentioned about any of this -- the gay 
situation, what my feelings about gays are. It has nothing to do with what 
we're gonna do. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, it's a golden opportunity, and I'm just flattered they have enough 
confidence in me to give me the opportunity. I'm not worried about whatever 
political point of view of mine they might be afraid of. I can tell you this 
whole gay thing is not something which I lead with. I'm not in any way, shape, 
matter or form planning to have it come up." 
</P>
<P>
A CBS spokeswoman says there are "no ground rules" restricting Limbaugh on the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
But did the Rooney situation influence his decision to avoid the subject of 
gays? "No," says Limbaugh, "because it was never in my mind to do it." And he 
agrees with CBS that no one has told him to stay away from the topic. 
</P>
<P>
"No. Never," he says. "It has not been said. Now, it might be said if I said, 
'You know, I would like to talk about the gay situation.' But I don't want to. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you something. Television is something I'm trying to learn. And this 
is a one-shot opportunity. You never know where these things lead. And the last 
thing I want to do is come on so strong that people are saying, 'Who is this 
guy?' 
</P>
<P>
"On radio, you can be a little controversial. You can come back the next day 
and explain what you mean to people who don't get it, might not understand. On 
a one-shot television show, you have to, in my mind, start out at a pace where 
you just don't totally blow people away. 
</P>
<P>
"I think coming on with something as sensitive as the gay issue and the AIDS 
issue and all the stuff that has now been hyped because of what happened to 
Rooney would not be in my best interests to do, regardless of how passionate I 
may be about it." 
</P>
<P>
Limbaugh maintains repeatedly that "I don't think I am known for my anti-gay 
comments. I have some outspoken opinions about the politics of the gay 
movement. I have simply opposed the politics of them." 
</P>
<P>
This may come as a remarkable view to those with a somewhat different 
perspective of Limbaugh. In December, for instance, he unloaded on AIDS and 
abortion activists who disrupted services at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New 
York, commenting: "I say to those of you of the leftist, militant, homosexual 
crowd: Take it somewhere else. Get out of our schools. Get out of our churches. 
Take your deadly, sickly behavior and keep it to yourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about these comments, Limbaugh says they are accurate and that he stands 
by them, but that the framework of what he was trying to get across was that 
the activists should have been seeking the comfort of the church rather than 
attacking it. That is hardly likely to satisfy his enemies and critics, but he 
says viewers who watch his hour on CBS won't get a show heavy on social issues: 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think people tune to late-night entertainment shows to listen to 
serious discussions of social ills and consequences. They're gonna be watching 
'Nightline' if they're interested in that kind of thing. I'd like to find a way 
to mix issue-oriented discussions with humor." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed he would. His CBS gig is vitally important to his attempt to crack into 
TV on a much wider scale. In a November interview with The Times, Limbaugh 
described himself as "a lovable little fuzz ball," "an entertainer first and a 
conservative second" -- and said he'd like to do a TV talk show that mixed 
topical issues with humor: "I'd like to be a comedian and I don't mind being a 
serious talk-show host." 
</P>
<P>
He's pursuing these TV goals actively, but says he's "written off" two recent 
attempts -- one for a call-in talk show on Cable News Network, the other as a 
panelist on a new version of "To Tell the Truth." 
</P>
<P>
As a nationally known conservative, he speaks with amazement of what he says a 
CNN executive told him: "Everybody here loves your tape. They just wish you 
were a little more liberal." Limbaugh interprets this as meaning that CNN 
thinks it is already well-stocked with such conservative commentators as Pat 
Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
But now there's the upcoming job at CBS, where the news department may tell Dan 
Rather or Andy Rooney to watch their step, but where network honchos tell Rush 
Limbaugh to just go ahead and do his thing. 
</P>
<P>
That's entertainment.

The political fortunes of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher have plunged 
further with the release of an opinion poll showing her Conservative Party 
18.5% behind the opposition Labor Party, its lowest standing in 19 years. The 
survey undertaken by Gallup for the Daily Telegraph newspaper indicated 
Thatcher's slide is due to a controversial new tax and her refusal to lower 
interest rates to spur economic growth. The poll put the Labor Party of Neil 
Kinnock at 49.5%, a rise of 1.5% from two previous polls.

Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun's troops gave up some ground gained in the latest savage 
fighting with the Lebanese Forces militia as part of a withdrawal apparently 
prompted by church and international pressure. The troops withdrew shortly 
after Lebanese Maronite Patriarch Nasrallah Butros Sfeir threatened Christian 
warlords and their men with excommunication unless they halted their month-old 
war for control of Christian East Beirut. Both Aoun and Lebanese Forces leader 
Samir Geagea vowed in separate statements to abide by the cease-fire called for 
by Sfeir.

Outraged highland peasants armed with sickles and homemade shotguns captured 13 
Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) guerrillas, killed them and sent the heads of 
nine of them to the local army commander, police said. Police said 200 peasants 
who organized into a village defense group because of their fear of reprisal by 
the Maoist-inspired insurgents ambushed 20 of them near Cochas, a town 30 miles 
northeast of Huancayo. After capturing the better-armed but outnumbered rebels, 
the peasants decapitated the nine.

SOVIET TROOPS TO LEAVE MONGOLIA IN 2 YEARS

The Soviet Union announced Friday after talks in Ulan Bator that it will 
withdraw the last of its troops from Mongolia over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
The official news agency Tass said remaining Soviet combat troops would be 
pulled out in 1991 and military units supervising the withdrawal of military 
hardware would leave the year after. 
</P>
<P>
"Under an agreement between the Soviet and Mongolian governments, the Soviet 
Union will withdraw all its troops from Mongolia in 1991-1992," Tass said in 
report from Ulan Bator on the Soviet-Mongolian talks. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union announced last March that it is withdrawing three-quarters of 
its 65,000 troops stationed in Mongolia, located between the Soviet Union and 
China. The partial pullout began in May and will be completed by the end of the 
year. Soviet troops were first sent to Mongolia in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin agreed Monday to pull out the last of its 73,500 troops from 
Czechoslovakia by July 1 next year. The Soviet Union is also negotiating with 
Hungary on the final withdrawal of troops still stationed there.

Molly Brenner looked up an old Navy buddy of her late father Friday. They had a 
brief chat, posed for a picture, shook hands and said goodby. 
</P>
<P>
Brenner wished the old Naval aviator could have visited a while longer, but she 
understood when he rushed off. After all, the President of the United States 
does have a few other pressing concerns. 
</P>
<P>
The quick meeting with President Bush, who was in Santa Ana on Friday for an 
anti-drug rally, was set up after Brenner wrote to the White House and 
requested to see the former Navy lieutenant who was shot down in the Pacific in 
1944 and rescued by the men of the USS Finback. Among them was her late father, 
James Griswold. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't believe he granted our request," Brenner said. "He said, 'Of 
course I made time for you guys -- I wouldn't be alive today if it wasn't for 
the men on the Finback.' I think he's a hero." 
</P>
<P>
Upon learning that Bush would be in Santa Ana, Brenner sent a letter by express 
mail to the White House and requested a meeting. To her surprise, a White House 
communications aide phoned on Tuesday to verify her identity. 
</P>
<P>
The communications officer made no promises in the phone call, and Brenner said 
she didn't hold out much hope as the week went on. But Thursday morning, at 
9:30, Brenner learned that her family was going to meet the President. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with special credentials, Brenner, joined by her son, Ted, 16, her 
daughter Amy, 13, and her husband, Superior Court Judge Michael Brenner, were 
taken to a VIP tent at Santa Ana Stadium on Friday, where they posed for a 
photograph with Bush and met many of the other dignitaries and celebrities in 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids got to meet (Bush) and shake his hand," Brenner said. "They haven't 
washed their hands yet. They met (Rams quarterback) Jim Everett. The whole 
scene was just amazing. What a day! They were on cloud nine." 
</P>
<P>
While it was the first time her children and her husband met the President, 
Brenner herself is an old hand at presidential protocol. She and her mother, 
Molly Griswold, were invited to a special reception in Washington for the 
Finback crew, their families and survivors during Bush's inauguration. James 
Griswold died in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a small, intimate affair," Brenner recalled. "He was absolutely warm 
and wonderful, he genuinely cared."

RALLY: EXCITEMENT AND ANTI-DRUG SENTIMENT RAN STRONG AMONG THE 13,000

<TEXT>
<P>
If there were any drug peddlers near Santa Ana Stadium on Friday, they probably 
weren't doing much business. 
</P>
<P>
About 13,000 people, ranging from elementary school students to adults in wool 
suits, chanted anti-drug slogans until they were hoarse during a rally for 
President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"Just Say No!" they shouted in unison with the Los Angeles Rams cheerleaders. 
"No Drugs!" they screamed when prompted by Rams quarterback Jim Everett. 
Anti-drug banners and signs encircled the field, and several thousand students 
on the field and in the stands feverishly waved yellow and red flags imprinted 
with the name of the foundation that sponsored the rally: Drug Use Is Life 
Abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Even a portable toilet at the back of the stadium was decorated for the day 
with a banner proclaiming it to be "Drug Free." 
</P>
<P>
"I want everyone in Orange County to hear you," Everett yelled to the crowd, 
just before introducing the President, and the crowd managed to make itself 
heard for several blocks, at least. 
</P>
<P>
Up front, just behind the VIP seating, was a group of students from Santa Ana's 
Taft School for the hearing-impaired. Page Syverson, a teacher from Lakewood, 
interpreted each speaker's words into sign language for the students, and they 
were getting the message. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe the President will say 'No to Drugs!' " said an excited Nicky Anglin, 
11, in sign language. 
</P>
<P>
The day was full of excitement for all the students, most of whom were bused to 
the event from Santa Ana schools. They listened to Vickie di Pascuale, a 
secretary in the Sheriff's Department drug education unit clad in a white dress 
and a saucy black hat, belt out a soulful rendition of "God Bless America." 
They joined their district superintendent, Rudy M. Castruita, and Santa Ana 
Mayor Daniel E. Young, in some self-congratulatory cheers. 
</P>
<P>
"You are the winners!" Young yelled, and the crowd gave a deafening response. 
"Stand up and be proud!" 
</P>
<P>
They listened to Chuck Norris plug his next film, "Delta Force 2," in which he 
takes on the Colombian drug cartel. They watched karate champion Jeff Smith's 
students perform martial arts routines and break wooden boards to the 
accompaniment of rock music. They heard the Mariachi Jalisco play a few Mexican 
folk songs. And they laughed as impressionist Fred Travelina delivered 
anti-drug messages in the voices of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Eddie Murphy, Clint 
Eastwood, Dr. Ruth Westheimer, Michael Jackson and the president himself. 
</P>
<P>
But the students knew why they were really there. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way people will listen not to take drugs is if the President comes 
and says that," said Antonia Soria, 10, a fifth-grader at Monte Vista 
Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
Another fifth-grader, Tasha Miles of Lincoln Elementary School, said she 
thought it was "great that we have this opportunity" to see the President. Were 
her friends who couldn't be at the stadium jealous? "I guess some of them are," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
The event came off without any major problems. At one point before the rally 
began, though, firefighters stopped students from entering the stadium because 
they could not get an accurate count of the crowd inside, said John Bennett, 
assistant superintendent for elementary schools in the Santa Ana Unified School 
District. The situation was resolved, but district administrators feared that 
some kids might get turned away. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a little panicky," Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
Other students and teachers were disappointed because the field area they were 
assigned to was behind a raised platform for the media horde covering the 
event, blocking their view of the stage. 
</P>
<P>
"This is kind of corny, and the kids are upset," said Hank Montelongo, a 
teacher at McFadden Intermediate School, which was the only school allowed to 
bring its entire student body to the rally because of its national scholastic 
honors. "The VIPs are sitting up there, where they can see. That's where the 
kids should be." 
</P>
<P>
Outside the stadium, office workers mingled in the street on their lunch hours 
to hear the President through loudspeakers. Police shut off entrances to the 
stadium at 11:15 a.m., about an hour before the President arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the President. Of course I'm going to listen to what he has to say," said 
Anthony Gutierrez, 29, a federal government employee. "I mean, how many times 
is that going to happen in Santa Ana? I think it's great that he's out here 
trying to get these kids to try to get their act together." 
</P>
<P>
Jurors who were deliberating a civil case in the nearby federal courthouse took 
a break to come and listen to the President. The group arrived in plenty of 
time to get into the stadium before entrances were sealed off. 
</P>
<P>
"We took a vote this morning, and the majority wanted to come and see the 
President," said Laurie Figueroa, a juror from Trabuco Canyon. "Any time you're 
deliberating, you get to make your own schedule." 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Niguel entrepreneur Steven Mellgren hoped to sell about 900 T-shirts at 
$9 each commemorating the President's visit. He was granted the contract to 
hawk his brightly lettered T-shirts at a stand inside the gate on the condition 
he donate proceeds from the first 400 sold to the Drug Use Is Life Abuse 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Mellgren said it took him about an hour to get his boxes of T-shirts through 
the security officials, who searched the boxes, ran them through metal 
detectors and had bomb squad dogs sniff them.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: RED TIDE SIEGE ADDS TO BEACH PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As cleanup crews continued to advance against the lingering remnants of oil on 
county beaches Friday, the first waves of a red tide rolled in, complicating 
the danger to shellfish and people who eat them. 
</P>
<P>
A red tide, which is caused by a concentration of microscopic plankton, can 
poison shellfish and other marine life but is usually not severe enough to harm 
swimmers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But combined with the possibility of oil on the ocean floor, the red tide has 
created a health hazard to anyone eating shellfish taken from the waters near 
where the tanker American Trader spilled 394,000 gallons of oil Feb. 7 after 
apparently puncturing its hull on its anchor. 
</P>
<P>
County health officials warned against eating the shellfish, calling the 
species "unsafe for human consumption," pending tests. 
</P>
<P>
On the beach, cleanup crews continued to make progress at removing oil from 
county beaches and jetties. All beaches north of the main Bolsa Chica lifeguard 
tower were open by Friday morning, and a section of coast from Magnolia Street 
to Beach Boulevard in Huntington Beach were scheduled to open at 6 a.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
The cleanup crew, which Friday numbered 220 workers, will continue to scour 
rocky areas through the weekend, but their efforts may be hampered by a 
drizzling rain forecast for today. The rain is expected to taper off by 
afternoon, however, leaving light winds and moderate swells behind. 
</P>
<P>
"We're making progress," Huntington Beach Marine Safety Capt. Bill Richardson 
said. "There's some beach left closed, but they've reopened a lot." 
</P>
<P>
He said crews are advancing at a rate of about 50 yards a day at the Bolsa 
Chica bluffs, but the work is laborious, with workers backtracking over areas 
already cleaned to be sure that more oil has not soiled them. 
</P>
<P>
By noon Friday, British Petroleum officials said area governments had reopened 
6 1/2 miles of coastline, including areas in Huntington and Newport Beach. That 
left 7 1/2 miles of closed beach, including a long stretch from Magnolia Street 
south to the Newport Pier and a smaller piece from Golden West Street to the 
main Bolsa Chica lifeguard tower. 
</P>
<P>
Most areas that remain closed are restricted because of cleanup efforts along 
jetties and rock groins. Those areas are harder to clean than beaches because 
access to them is more difficult, and crews must often work in the water. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of stuff stuck up in between the rocks," Richardson said. "It 
could be some time before we get all of it." 
</P>
<P>
Beaches near the groins will remain closed during cleaning, he added, because 
oil is dislodged by the process. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Roger Kemple, senior vice president of Golden West Refining, which 
owns the offshore mooring where the accident occurred, said the company is 
being hurt by restrictions placed on the facility. Because the American Trader 
accident is still under investigation, the Coast Guard has indefinitely 
prohibited tankers with drafts deeper than 20 feet from using the mooring, 
which effectively limits traffic there to barges. 
</P>
<P>
"In the short term, that's acceptable to us, but in the long term, if it 
continues, it will create quite a hardship," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kemple said the company's concerns have been relayed to the Coast Guard, which 
he said has not responded. JIM NEWTON

CITY TO GET $250,000 TOWARD PIER PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder on Monday is scheduled to donate a 
$250,000 county matching grant to help the city rebuild its municipal pier. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder, whose district includes Huntington Beach, expects that the contribution 
will be the first of several county donations toward the pier project, said 
Barbara Foster, an executive assistant to the supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
In order to collect the grant, the city must raise an additional $55,000, 
Deputy City Administrator Richard Barnard said. The city's Pier Committee and 
advisory board, established to raise money for the project, have already 
collected $180,000 in private donations and has another $15,000 available to 
reconstruct the city landmark, Barnard said. 
</P>
<P>
The pier project is listed as a priority issue on the county budget proposed 
for 1990-91, Foster said. If the budget is approved, the city could receive as 
much as $1 million more in county funds during the next year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The county's financial help could prove crucial to the project. City officials 
estimate it will cost at least $10.5 million to rebuild the pier. The Pier 
Committee has reported that its efforts to raise money thus far have been well 
below expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, city officials say that the new pier will be completed by its 
target opening date of Labor Day, 1991. JOHN PENNER

'POLES' TO BE MOVED FROM CIVIC CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An artist agreed Friday to remove her work from the Civic Center plaza after 
city officials declared it a safety hazard. The piece, "Wavering Poles," is 
part of an exhibit by 10 Orange County artists which opened Thursday and 
continues for four months. 
</P>
<P>
The sculpture will be moved to the Fountain Valley headquarters of FHP 
Healthcare for the duration of the exhibition period. The Irvine exhibit 
consists of work by artists who were finalists in a competition sponsored by 
FHP last year. 
</P>
<P>
The artist, Angie Bray of Laguna Beach, said she is concerned that viewers 
won't be able to "see the piece functioning" at the new location, "but at least 
it will have some sort of (attractive) setting." City officials had threatened 
to move the piece into the Civic Center building, even though Bray designed it 
to be seen out-of-doors. 
</P>
<P>
"Wavering Poles" is a cluster of slender, upright aluminum poles in graduated 
heights, mounted so that they can sway in the breeze. According to Community 
Services Department employees, the city's risk management and liability staff 
was concerned that the beveled tops of the poles could injure anyone who yanked 
on them. At FHP, the public will not be able to touch the poles. 
</P>
<P>
Stanchions and police barrier tape surrounded the delicate-looking piece in 
Irvine on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Toni McDonald, the city's cultural affairs superintendent, said there was a 
"misunderstanding" about who was responsible for inspecting "Wavering Poles." 
She said one inspector initially passed the work, based on a diagram Bray 
submitted, but another inspector rejected it. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald had given Bray the alternative of placing the work inside the Civic 
Center, against a wall and separated from the public by a fence. But the artist 
declined because the work was specifically made for the outdoor site. "The 
point of the piece is what it does there," Bray said. "It responds to air 
currents, and to the harmonic resonance from the huge helicopters that hover 
around there all day. Depending on how far or how close (the aircraft are), a 
different pole quivers." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Bray bridled at the idea of moving the piece at all. "I'm not going 
to say I disagree about the danger or that I (want to) impose this piece" on 
the public, she said. "I understand they (the city officials) don't have much 
experience in public art. But they have a responsibility to take seriously the 
work they accept and to think ahead" by scrutinizing the diagram she submitted 
for potential safety problems. "If they don't, then they do have an obligation 
to the person who did the work." 
</P>
<P>
Bray originally designed a different piece, a fence made of flexible bamboo 
poles, which was to be placed on the Civic Center lawn. (The illustrated 
brochure for the Irvine exhibit shows a model of that sculpture rather than the 
one actually in place.) But when Ann Thorne, the city's public art consultant, 
told Bray the lawn irrigation system might damage the poles, she was asked to 
make a piece for the courtyard instead. CATHY CURTIS

RAY CAROLIN TO RUN FOR CITY COUNCIL SEAT

<TEXT>
<P>
Although the City Council election is seven months away, marketing consultant 
Ray Carolin declared himself a candidate Friday in an attempt to capitalize on 
the defeat of an effort to recall Councilman Robert A. Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
By a 2-to-1 margin last week, voters defeated a recall campaign against Curtis 
that was heavily financed by the Mission Viejo Co. 
</P>
<P>
In a press release, Carolin, 42, accused the company, as well as Mayor 
Christian W. Keena and Council members Victoria C. Jaffe and Norman P. Murray 
of wrongly taking roles in the recall effort. Keena, Murray and Jaffe are up 
for reelection on Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Jaffe, although critical of Curtis, never publicly sided with the pro-recall 
Alliance for for Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Carolin, said that even though the election is not until November, he only 
recently met Curtis and Councilman William S. Craycraft, Curtis' sole ally on 
the council, and intends to align himself with them. 
</P>
<P>
Carolin decided to announce his candidacy while the recall campaign is fresh in 
the minds of voters. 
</P>
<P>
"The past recall election so offended me that I felt we need to try to provide 
effective and dynamic leaders in the community," said Carolin, a seven-year 
resident of the community. 
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Carolin called Keena "a weak and ineffective leader" who has 
"no vision for the City of Mission Viejo. While the Mission Viejo Co. launched 
an attack on the democratic process and one of his fellow elected officials, he 
never took a stand and said, 'Enough is enough,' " 
</P>
<P>
But, Carolin added, as a council member, he would act as a peacemaker and said 
"I don't consider myself an enemy of the Mission Viejo Co.," which contributed 
more than $250,000 to the recall against Curtis. JAMES M. GOMEZ

REOPENING PLANNED OF 2 HIGHWAY LANES

City officials announced Friday that a stretch of coastal highway will be 
reopened in two weeks, but the roadway will not be fully accessible until July 
1. 
</P>
<P>
Two lanes of El Camino Real between Camino Capistrano and Avenida Pico will be 
opened while crews work to shore up the 1,800-foot-long cliff that runs 
adjacent to the highway, according to City Manager Michael Parness. 
</P>
<P>
The roadway has been closed since Feb. 6. 
</P>
<P>
A bike path, also closed since then, will also be reopened. 
</P>
<P>
Closure of the road has caused traffic problems and complaints from a handful 
of business owners who say that customers can no longer reach their stores. 
</P>
<P>
The two lanes that will be opened to relieve traffic congestion will close 
again in April while crews haul away up to 200,000 cubic yards of dirt from the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
The two lanes will then reopen May 15, Parness said, and remain open through 
July. JAMES M. GOMEZ

UNOCAL WINS OK TO INSTALL GENERATOR 
</P>

<P>
City Planning Commissioners voted 4 to 0 this week to let Unocal Corp. install 
a 3.8-megawatt power plant for its Science and Technology Center -- as long as 
noise from the operation is kept down. 
</P>
<P>
Residents living near the proposed electrical plant, at the northeast corner of 
Imperial Highway and Valencia Avenue, remain skeptical but say the 
conditional-use permit granted Wednesday was an improvement over earlier 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
About 60 residents attended the commission meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"We are still apprehensive," said local resident Pat Moore, "but all the 
suggestions we made, (the Planning Commission) looked into. They have come a 
long way." 
</P>
<P>
The plant's noise level will be monitored at the beginning of its operation, 
again after one year of operation and whenever a noise complaint is made, 
Planning Commissioner Carl Clausen said. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Planner Patricia Shoemaker said the conditional-use permit issued by the 
planning board can be appealed to the City Council up to 10 days after its 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker said Unocal's noise-abatement program includes limiting the plant's 
hours of operation from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. during weekdays and placing the 
generator in a building to muffle any noise. 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker also said the electrical plant, which will replace six boilers now 
being used at the Center, will also reduce carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide 
emissions at the site. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Clark, manager of Unocal's engineering services, said the plant could be 
used by the city for power in an emergency situation. 
</P>
<P>
The city's noise consultant, Otto Bixler of Acoustical Impacts International, 
said Unocal's noise-abatement plan for the plant exceeds the city's noise 
ordinance limit by only six decibels . The human ear cannot perceive a 
difference in noise level less that three decibels, Bixler said. BONNIE SINNOCK

LEASING OF CAMPUS SPACE TO BE STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As a way to raise money, Fullerton School District officials next week will 
consider the specifics of leasing space on a school campus to businesses. 
</P>
<P>
School district officials would like to lease space for commercial activities 
on the Brookhurst Road side of Orangethorpe Elementary School while classes 
continue on the rest of the school grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The school board signed a contract last month with Newport Resource Management 
of Newport Beach to look at ways the commercially valuable land could be leased 
out, using the income to pay for some of the $4 million in backlogged 
maintenance needed for district schools and buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The study is expected to take about a month. If the board decides to lease out 
a portion of the land, some of the classroom buildings might be rebuilt on the 
quieter east end of the campus, school officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
"Leasing excess land is becoming a more prudent way for school districts to 
generate revenue," said Rush N. Hill II, chairman of Newport Resource 
Management. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of raising taxes, which voters have consistently said they don't want, 
school districts can earn money by finding land that commercial ventures might 
be interested in leasing on a long-term basis, Hill said. That way, he said, 
the district earns money but keeps the land in case it is needed later. 
</P>
<P>
Before state legislation in 1987, school districts earning money through such 
ventures usually had to give it to the state, Hill said. The new law, which 
encourages all school districts to begin joint public-private ventures on 
unused land, allows school districts to keep the lease income. 
</P>
<P>
School districts in California have leased out both vacant parcels and portions 
of school sites, such as large athletic fields, that were going unused, he 
said. The trick is finding a commercial venture that would fit in with 
activities permitted on the property. 
</P>
<P>
"We've not yet run into conditions where compatibility could not be achieved," 
Hill said. TOM McQUEENEY

KARICH DRIBBLES TO A DIFFERENT DRUMMER 
</P>

<P>
Andy Karich's uniform number is as unconventional as his life style. 
</P>
<P>
The Mater Dei High School forward wears "00" on the back of his red and gray 
jersey, the first player basketball Coach Gary McKnight has allowed to wear 
double zero. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't particularly like that number," McKnight said. "It's not conventional, 
and I'm a conventional-type coach. But I gave in when we ordered new uniforms 
last year and made an exception in Andy's case." 
</P>
<P>
McKnight made the exception for an exceptional athlete who excels in sports, in 
the classroom and in the ocean, surfing near his beachside home in Surfside. 
</P>
<P>
Karich, a 6-foot-6 senior, was named the most valuable player in the Angelus 
League, averaging 10.1 points, 5.3 rebounds and 4.6 assists and shot 50% from 
the field for a Monarch team that has five players averaging between nine and 
14.8 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a great understanding of the game," McKnight said. "He does everything 
real well. He's like having another coach on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
Karich was a standout free safety and wide receiver on Mater Dei's football 
teams in his freshman and sophomore seasons. He quit the sport because of a 
stress fracture in his lower back. 
</P>
<P>
"The wear and tear of playing football since the fifth grade took its toll," 
Karich said. "Although I thought about playing this season. Danny O'Neil 
(Monarch quarterback) tried to persuade me to play all summer." 
</P>
<P>
Karich spent the summer playing in the countless number of basketball 
tournaments in which Mater Dei participates, but admitted, "I wish I could have 
had more time to go surfing." 
</P>
<P>
He started surfing as a 7-year-old when his family moved from Fountain Valley 
to Surfside. His favorite surfing spots are Trestles and Huntington Beach, and 
he says the sport has helped improve his upper-body strength. 
</P>
<P>
Karich is equally talented in the classroom, where he has a 4.2 grade-point 
average at Mater Dei, receiving only two Bs in four years. He scored a 1,160 on 
his Scholastic Aptitude Test and received a basketball scholarship to attend 
the University of Santa Clara in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Karich visited Baylor and San Jose State before accepting the offer from Santa 
Clara, where he plans to study medicine. 
</P>
<P>
"Santa Clara is a strong academic school with a small-school atmosphere that I 
really like," he said. "I also thought it was the best opportunity for me to 
play right away." 
</P>
<P>
Karich began playing basketball in the fifth grade and was a member of a 
seventh-grade traveling all-star team that included current teammates Jason 
Quinn and Derek Stone, Mater Dei football star Ryan Motherway and Marina point 
guard Travis Boyd. 
</P>
<P>
He has worn "00" throughout his career and was the tallest player in the eighth 
grade at St. Bonaventure before enrolling at Mater Dei. He played on an 
undefeated freshman team and then as a sophomore was a starter on a junior 
varsity team that lost only two games, both to varsity teams. 
</P>
<P>
Last season Karich started for the Monarchs' varsity team that finished 25-3, 
but became the first McKnight-coached team at Mater Dei that failed to reach a 
Southern Section championship game, losing to St. Monica in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone naturally thought we were going to win," Karich said. "We were 25-3, 
but it's hard to please at the school when you're used to winning championships 
every year. Most of the students felt sorry for us, but some others couldn't 
understand. They think we should win every game. 
</P>
<P>
"We learned one thing from that loss: We're not invincible. Over the summer, we 
made a commitment to try and win every game this year." 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei's only defeat came against Long Beach Poly in the final of the 
Tournament of Champions at Ocean View. The Monarchs (29-1) meet Loyola (23-3) 
for the 5-A Division championship at 6:45 tonight in the Los Angeles Sports 
Arena, and Karich expects a high-scoring game. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll take a lot of shots and run whenever they can," Karich said. "Our 
biggest problem will be to stop their transition game. I don't know what to 
expect. I don't know if I'll be nervous, but our practices have been intense 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
"Win or lose, this has been a great season. This is a great team. "

VOLLEYBALL CAN WAIT FOR LAGUNA BEACH'S BLANTON 
</P>

LAGUNA BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the natural order of things, basketball season at Laguna Beach High School 
is over this time of the year and Dain Blanton can concentrate on volleyball, 
the sport that likely will help him earn a college scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
But this is far from an ordinary year at this school by the beach. The 
volleyball team played its first match Friday night without Blanton and six 
others who probably will make the varsity because today, for the first time in 
27 years, Laguna Beach will play for a Southern Section basketball 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
The Artists will meet St. Joseph at 9:45 a.m. today at the Los Angeles Sports 
Arena for the section's 2-A basketball title. And as far as Blanton is 
concerned, volleyball can wait, although schools such as USC, UCLA, Stanford, 
UC Santa Barbara and Hawaii are pursuing him as a volleyball player. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to get out on the volleyball court, but we've got this going," Blanton 
said. "We usually don't get this far. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a blast playing in the Sports Arena. That will be a 
once-in-a-lifetime thing." 
</P>
<P>
Some say today need not be the only time that Blanton, a senior who is 
averaging more than 19 points and six rebounds for the Artists, plays in such a 
basketball arena. At 6-feet-3 1/2, well-muscled and quick, Blanton is the type 
of athlete who usually is a major college basketball prospect. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of spending his summers honing the skills he would need to switch 
from a big forward in high school to a big guard in college, he plays 
volleyball with his club team. 
</P>
<P>
"Dain could have been a Division I basketball player if he played as much 
basketball as he does volleyball," Laguna Beach assistant coach Greg Marshall 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As he walked across the Laguna Beach basketball court, another assistant, Bret 
Fleming, joked: "He'd be a lot better if we strung up a net in here." 
</P>
<P>
"That's been the cliche about Laguna kids," Fleming said later. "They have a 
tendency to (only) do well in sports that have nets between the players, like 
tennis and volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
"But Dain is kind of an exception to the rule. He competes hard (at 
basketball)." 
</P>
<P>
Blanton said he plays no favorites. He enjoys both sports equally and divides 
his time between them. From September to February, he plays basketball; from 
February to August, he plays volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
Blanton realizes he might have the talent to be a major college basketball 
player if he dedicated himself completely to the sport, but he said 
concentrating on one sport is monotonous. Besides, he said, he hasn't been 
approached by many college basketball coaches. 
</P>
<P>
And, after all, this is Laguna Beach and the lure of the local life style is a 
powerful one. The basketball played on courts at Main Beach may draw serious 
competition, but volleyball is king and Blanton grew up playing among some of 
the best volleyball players in the world. 
</P>
<P>
He is now a triple-A rated beach volleyball player, which is one level below 
the rating of the professionals he would like to join someday. 
</P>
<P>
But first, Blanton wants to get his education and he plans to use his athletic 
ability to pay for it. He said he has learned from the mistakes of his older 
brother, Kurt, who although heavily recruited when he played volleyball for the 
Artists in the mid-1980s, missed out on a scholarship because of marginal 
grades. Blanton said he has a 3.4 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
"I just made it a point to keep my grades up and not put what I have in 
jeopardy," Blanton said.

ORANGE-LAGUNA HILLS RIVALRY RESUMES

Somewhere in the equipment room at Orange High School is a pair of scissors 
that represents the boys' soccer rivalry between Orange and Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
When the teams play for the Southern Section 2-A championship at 8 tonight at 
Gahr High School in Cerritos, the story likely will be told again. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, after the Pacific Coast League was formed, an Orange soccer player 
said that if the Panthers lost a league match, the entire team would get 
flat-top haircuts. The quote appeared in the school's newspaper and soon word 
reached the players at Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the newspaper adviser at Laguna Hills, so I received a copy of the 
Orange paper," Laguna Hills Coach Scott Johnson said. "Needless to say, I took 
it to practice with me that day." 
</P>
<P>
The first time the teams played, Laguna Hills won, 3-0. Afterward, the Hawk 
players presented the Orange team with an oversized pair of yellow scissors. 
The Panthers, true to their word, all got flat-tops. 
</P>
<P>
The teams have been rivals, friendly ones anyway, ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"The story gets passed down every year," said Orange Coach Ed Carrillo, who was 
an assistant that season. "We even have two players this season whose brothers 
were on that team." 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Orange (20-0-3) has defeated Laguna Hills (23-5) in all three 
matches between the schools this season. However, Carrillo said word has 
reached him that Johnson claimed the Panthers scored a few cheap goals in those 
matches. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, they got a couple of cheesy goals on us," Johnson said. "In the first 
game, one of our players knocked one in for them. In the second game, one of 
our guys tried to clear the ball and missed. They had a shot right in front of 
the net. We've helped them. 
</P>
<P>
Said Carrillo: "Cheesy huh? Well, it's got to be in the back of their minds 
that we beat them three times this season. And we beat them for the summer 
league championship last July. They have to wonder at this point if they can 
beat us." 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills is led by forward Brian Slayback, who broke the school record for 
goals in a season during the semifinals against Cypress. Slayback has 24 goals, 
one more than Brian Fleming scored in 1986-87. He also has 17 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Slayback scored Laguna Hills' only goal in the three losses. Orange goalie Tres 
Martin has shut out Laguna Hills twice. 
</P>
<P>
"Martin has said some things that has gotten our kids fired up," Johnson said. 
"He said no one can beat him in the air. If we get a high goal, our kids will 
go wild." 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks have been preparing for Martin, a 6-foot-3, 225-pound senior. During 
Thursday's practice, one of the Laguna Hills' players taped two photos of 
Martin in the goal. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who hit Martin's picture with a shot," Johnson said, "didn't have to 
run as much in practice." 
</P>
<P>
Orange has continued to dominate in the playoffs despite losing defenseman 
Justin Zayas, the league's most valuable player. Zayas was declared 
academically ineligible before the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Rick Heimer has 17 goals, including five in the playoffs.

AKJOL WANTS TO RETURN HOME WITH TITLE

<TEXT>
<P>
Ali Akjol will take a lot with him when he returns home this summer. As an 
exchange student at El Toro High School, Akjol has absorbed American culture: 
the attitudes and styles, including neon T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
In July he will take that knowledge, and the shirts, back to Essen, West 
Germany. But the souvenir Akjol really wants is a letterman's jacket with a 
Southern Section championship patch on it. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, he may get that patch. El Toro plays Cerritos in the 3-A soccer final 
at Gahr High School in Cerritos at 8. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing how much he's learned about our culture," El Toro soccer Coach 
Carlos Acre said. "What does a Southern Section patch mean to someone over in 
West Germany? Nothing. But Ali has picked up how much it means to kids here." 
</P>
<P>
When Akjol arrived in September, he expected the United States to be a virtual 
wasteland when it came to soccer. 
</P>
<P>
Akjol, who has played soccer since he was 5, didn't even bring cleats with him; 
the only soccer shorts he had were for show. 
</P>
<P>
"When I found out they had soccer at El Toro, I thought I would walk out and be 
a starter," Akjol said. "Then I saw a couple of the players and realized I was 
going to have to work at it. They were a lot better than I thought they would 
be." 
</P>
<P>
Akjol did become a starter, but at first, playing was difficult because of the 
language barrier. Although he understood English, he had trouble communicating. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember one time during a game, Ali told us to pass the ball to the other 
team," teammate Greg Schaick said. "But he picked the language up pretty 
quickly. He doesn't like to tell anybody, but Ali is No. 1 in his class in 
Germany. He buys every newspaper every day and spends hours reading them. He's 
very intelligent." 
</P>
<P>
Akjol said soccer helped him learn the English language quicker, in much the 
same way it had helped him learn German. Akjol's parents are from Turkey but 
moved to Germany when his father got a job at an import/export company in 
Essen. 
</P>
<P>
Although Akjol was born in Germany, he spoke mostly Turkish because that's what 
his family and friends spoke. He didn't become fluent in German until after 
playing soccer on a club team. 
</P>
<P>
"He understands a lot more than you realize," Acre said. "I used to talk real 
slow to him, so he could understand. Then one day, a couple of the players 
said, 'Coach, Ali understands every word.' But he's so quiet, you're never 
sure." 
</P>
<P>
Acre, in fact, has only seen Akjol get vocal once. On the bus ride home after 
the Chargers' semifinal victory over Dominguez, the players were discussing 
international soccer. 
</P>
<P>
Al Majia and Jair Gonzalez, whose families are from Colombia, started telling 
everyone that Colombia was going to win the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden, this quiet kid from West Germany became a nationalist," Acre 
said. "There was a lot of flag waving during the bus ride. There were even a 
few kids who said the United States would win a couple games in the World Cup. 
That got some laughs." 
</P>
<P>
Akjol has had a few problems adjusting to the style of soccer. He said the game 
here is a little rougher than it is in Europe, which he attributes to the 
influence of football. 
</P>
<P>
The rules of the game differ somewhat. In one game, Akjol got a yellow card 
because he kicked the ball while the other team was setting up for a direct 
kick. 
</P>
<P>
"In Europe, you don't have to wait for the referee to blow the whistle to kick 
the ball," Acre said. "So, when the kid from the other team touched the ball to 
set it up for the kick, Ali thought it was in play. Ali looked a little 
bewildered." 
</P>
<P>
Akjol is among the team leaders in goals with 11 and also is one of El Toro's 
better passers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing how well the other guys have accepted him," Acre said. "You're 
talking about Orange County high school kids who have to make a remark about 
every hair that's out of place. And our team is very cliquish. But Ali is just 
one of the guys. He's even wearing fluorescent shirts now." 
</P>
<P>
After months of learning and interacting, there's only one thing left for 
Akjol. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely want that patch," he said. "It'll give me something to show my 
friends when I get home."

<P>
The basketball coaches in the Orange Empire Conference have contended for the 
past few years that the conference is the best in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The point was made stronger when five of the seven members reached the Southern 
California regional playoffs, which started a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
Three of those teams -- Cypress, Rancho Santiago and Golden West -- can reach 
the final eight in the state. 
</P>
<P>
In the four Southern California regional finals at 7:30 tonight, Cypress plays 
host to El Camino, Glendale is at Rancho Santiago, Moorpark at Golden West and 
Compton is at Antelope Valley. The winners will advance along with the four 
winners from Northern California to the quarterfinals at UC Irvine, March 8-10. 
</P>
<P>
A look at tonight's games: 
</P>

El Camino (22-10) at Cypress (28-3) -- Cypress Coach Don Johnson got his 500th 
victory when the Chargers defeated Oxnard in the second round Wednesday. This 
will be the second time the teams have met this season. The Chargers defeated 
El Camino, 70-49, in December. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino struggled in the South Coast Conference to a fourth-place finish, but 
has been impressive in the playoffs. The Warriors, seeded 23rd, upset No. 10 
Santa Monica, 81-79, last Saturday, then upset No. 7 Los Angeles City, 97-90, 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale (24-11) at Rancho Santiago (28-3) -- Rancho Santiago, the third-seeded 
team, breezed by Los Angeles Harbor, 105-68, in the second round. The same 
night, Glendale upset Cerritos, 71-63. Cerritos was the sixth-seeded team and 
the defending state champion. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale has been up and down this season, but did defeat Cypress, 68-55, in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago is much taller across the front with Matt Lien (6-feet-9), 
Corie Blount (6-4) and Gene Altamirano (6-4). Glendale's tallest starter is 6-6 
Justin Lord, but the Vaqueros are quick. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark (23-10) at Golden West (23-10) -- Golden West's 23 victories are the 
most the program has had since Coach Jim Greenfield took over in 1978. Golden 
West's best season was 1970-71 when the Rustlers were 26-6 under Coach Dick 
Stricklin. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West is down to eight players because of injuries, and starting forward 
Kevin Andersen was ill Wednesday but still played as Golden West, the 
12th-seeded team, ousted fifth-seeded Los Angles Valley, 84-80. Andersen is 
expected to be back at full strength tonight.

Golden West College made up for a slow start in plenty of time to take a 74-59 
victory over Cerritos in the semifinals of state tournament Friday night at 
College of the Sequoias. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West scored only 10 points in the first 10 minutes, but point guard Bits 
Sirchia broke free for 12 points in the next 10 to spark the Rustlers. 
</P>
<P>
Sirchia and Claudette Jackson led Golden West with 18 points each. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West (36-1) will play College of the Sequoias at 7 tonight for the state 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West has made the state tournament the past four years, but this is the 
first time the Rustlers have reached the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
"Bits Sirchia saved us in the first half," Golden West Coach Dave Stricklin 
said. "Every time the ball went inside, they sagged off. . . . Once she hit 
those, they didn't sag as much." 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos (26-7) slowed the game and built a 16-10 lead, but Golden West led, 
34-25, at the half and padded the margin with a 16-2 run to start the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson grabbed 14 rebounds as did Donna Gondringer, who continued to struggle 
offensively with nine points. 
</P>
<P>
Dawn Haag came off the bench to score eight consecutive points for Golden West. 
She finished with 10. 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos' Lisa Pounds made six three-point shots and scored 22. BRENDAN HEALEY

CALIFORNIA'S SECOND RIPLEY'S MUSEUM DUE IN BUENA PARK

San Francisco may still be the only place in California with a Bay Bridge, but 
Orange County is about to follow San Francisco's lead and become the state's 
second site of a Ripley's Believe It Or Not Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Fong &amp; Paul Associates, operator of the Movieland Wax Museum on Beach 
Boulevard, has acquired a franchise from Ripley International Inc., in Toronto, 
Canada, and plans to open for business in Buena Park in June. 
</P>
<P>
The operators will invest about $250,000 to set up the museum, said marketing 
director Barry Muszik. 
</P>
<P>
Fong &amp; Paul has retained Irvine's Jordan-Valli Architects Inc. to develop 
an 8,500-square-foot facility across the street from Movieland. 
</P>
<P>
There are 13 Ripley's museums worldwide and five more are being planned, 
including one each in Japan and Europe, Muszik said. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Fong, president of Fong &amp; Paul Associates, said he is searching for 
more Hollywood memorabilia to be featured in a special area at the Orange 
County Ripley's. In addition to the Hollywood collection, the museum will 
showcase cultural, political and scientific oddities.

LA HABRA CONTRACTOR IS LATEST VICTIM OF VANDALS IN STRIKE; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: TIRES ARE PUNCTURED AT A CONSTRUCTION YARD THAT DOES BUSINESS WITH OWL 
ROCK PRODUCT CO. DAMAGE TO THE STRUCK COMPANY AND ITS CUSTOMERS HAS BEEN 
ESTIMATED AT $500,000.

<TEXT>
<P>
Chuck Rizzuto is a union contractor who has no quarrels with anyone. But as a 
customer of the struck Owl Rock Product Co., he has become mired in its bitter 
fight with Local 12 of the Pasadena-based International Union of Operating 
Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, vandals with ice picks broke into the La Habra construction 
yard of Rizzuto's Republic Concrete Inc. and punctured every tire of the 11 
cars and trucks parked at the job site. On their way out, they sprayed-painted 
a warning message on a car: Owl Scab. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra police estimated the damage at $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
The incident followed a string of similar vandalism carried out by unknown 
people on Republic's job sites in Riverside and San Bernardino counties in the 
past three weeks, Rizzuto said. 
</P>
<P>
And Republic is not the only company that does business with Owl Rock to be 
struck by vandals. Similar incidents occurred recently in the yards of FST Sand 
and Gravel in Riverside, Gail Trucking Co. in Corona and other firms. Owl Rock 
officials estimated that recent vandalizing of Owl Rock job sites and of its 
customers and suppliers has totaled more than $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Owl Rock is one of Southern California's major suppliers of construction 
materials. Ontario-based Mitsubishi Cement Corp., a unit of Mitsubishi Corp. of 
Tokyo, bought a 50% stake in Owl Rock last year. 
</P>
<P>
As with Rizzuto's firm, this is the first time vandals have broken into the FST 
job site, said Bill Medina, FST's general manager. And like Rizzuto, Medina was 
approached by union leaders weeks ago and told either to sever business ties 
with or find a non-union alternative to Owl Rock. 
</P>
<P>
But customers remain unfazed. "The incident will not affect our relationship 
with Owl Rock, because their pricing is cheaper," said Medina, adding that Owl 
Rock does about $15,000 a month in business with his firm. 
</P>
<P>
The troubles of Arcadia-based Owl Rock started five months ago, after its labor 
contract with the union expired. Negotiations on wages and benefits broke down 
in late September; the union went on strike. 
</P>
<P>
The 26,000-member union represents workers at 20 Owl Rock plants in Los 
Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
"We had vandalism, sabotage and picket-line violence from Sept. 29, the first 
day of the strike," said Mike Broome, Owl Rock's vice president of operations 
and assistant general manager. 
</P>
<P>
In some plants, conveyor belts were cut, tires slashed, acid poured into 
control panels and sand poured into diesel engines, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, Owl Rock stunned union workers by bringing in permanent 
replacements for the strikers. Then plant vandalism escalated, Broome said. 
</P>
<P>
David Paul Koppelman, general counsel of the union's Local 12, denied any link 
between the incidents and the union, saying his group does not sanction 
vandalism in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Broome said that except for the San Bernardino and Azusa police 
departments, "We've been getting little cooperation from law enforcement to 
stop the violence in the plants." 
</P>
<P>
This week, Owl Rock took matters into its own hands. It hired John J. Knott, a 
private investigator and former Los Angeles Police Department detective, to 
track down the vandals. Knott said he will work closely with police 
investigators in the four counties. 
</P>
<P>
Owl Rock also dispatched security guards to monitor the job sites of customers 
who have been vandalized, including Rizzuto's firm. 
</P>
<P>
Owl Rock plans to hold a press conference, tentatively next week, to call 
attention to the recent violence.

Blanket response: Bernard Abrams, chairman and founder of Three D Bed &amp; 
Bath, and his son, Donald Lee Abrams, president of the 27-store chain, aren't 
letting Orange County's dismal response to their plea for blankets for the 
homeless get them down. 
</P>
<P>
Only 32 used blankets had been dropped off at Three D's three Orange County 
stores by Friday -- five days after the Abrams ran an ad seeking county 
residents' help -- so they've decided to donate 500 new blankets from their 
Costa Mesa-based company. 
</P>
<P>
The blankets will be given to three Orange County social service organizations 
for the homeless, Donald Abrams said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The blankets have a retail value of about $5,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Abrams spent $4,000 for a full-page advertisement in an Orange County 
newspaper Sunday. The ad, which showed a photograph of an elderly homeless man 
asleep on a park bench, asked people to gather up their old blankets and bring 
them to Three D stores so they could be donated to local shelters. 
</P>
<P>
As an added incentive, a 20% discount was offered on purchases of new blankets 
to anyone who brought in an old one. 
</P>
<P>
The blankets have not exactly been flooding in. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported Thursday that only 23 blankets had been received by the 
Three D stores in Irvine, Tustin and Westminster. On Friday, nine more came in. 
</P>
<P>
Abrams said the company could only run the ad one time because of the expense. 
It is possible, he said, that many people forgot about or never saw it. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than spend more money on another ad," he said, "we decided to donate 
new blankets to make sure that the needs of the homeless will be fulfilled." 
</P>
<P>
The blankets will be delivered at noon today to Orangecoast Interfaith Shelter 
in Costa Mesa; Cover Wings, a charity organization in Anaheim, and LEAP, a 
division of the Orange County Child Abuse Council in Santa Ana.

Marcia Smith-Field spent one year and thousands of dollars entrenched in a 
divorce that left her devastated -- and without custody of her two daughters. 
</P>
<P>
It was the end of a troubled nine-year marriage during which Field battled 
depression. Her struggle continued throughout a separation and a bitter divorce 
that resulted in a custody trial. Halfway through that fight, Field, fatigued 
and outmaneuvered, surrendered; she conceded custody of her girls, ages 6 and 
9, to her ex-husband. 
</P>
<P>
"I fought because I felt it would be important some day for my children to know 
that I did," Field said. "But after a year I was emotionally exhausted and 
financially drained." 
</P>
<P>
She did not know it at the time, but her depression was driving her to seek 
what she felt lacking, what her ex-husband seemed to have -- a network of 
support. 
</P>
<P>
"He had an extended family, a lot more support than I did," she said. And, she 
thought, "Custody is not a forever thing. The children's needs would change, I 
would get stronger. I was sure we'd be together again one day." 
</P>
<P>
The custody trial ended in December, 1988. Soon after, Field's father died of 
leukemia. The double blow left her grieving as both a daughter and a mother. 
</P>
<P>
"It was devastating to lose my father," Field said. But she felt a tragic 
comparison. "The pain of losing my children was even greater." 
</P>
<P>
It was compounded by guilt over having conceded custody. "I was suffering 
tremendously. When the children came to visit, all I did was cry." She reacted 
to those feelings by isolating herself. 
</P>
<P>
Then, last August, she got an idea. 
</P>
<P>
"I suffered in silence for eight months. Then I realized there had to be 
others," Field said. 
</P>
<P>
By September she was putting up posters in the family relations offices of 
courthouses and in YWCAs and YMCAs in the area. They read: "Parents Without 
Custody -- A support group for mothers and fathers who have lost custody of 
their children. Speak out! You need no longer suffer in silence." 
</P>
<P>
The reaction surprised her. In no time at all, there was a group meeting in her 
Stamford home. Soon an offshoot of that group got started in nearby Danbury. 
</P>
<P>
When Field took her daughters skiing in Vermont, she met a man, also a 
non-custodial parent, who was on an outing with his daughter. Now a Parents 
Without Custody group is meeting in the man's home. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Danbury News-Times printed a story about Field and sent it over the 
news wire, where it was picked up by a newspaper in Missouri. In a town called 
Carl Junction the story caught the eye of a divorced woman who called Field 
asking for guidelines to start a group there. 
</P>
<P>
Next a woman in Portland, Me., heard about it and a group is starting there 
too. 
</P>
<P>
In only a few months, Parents Without Custody has spread, mostly by word of 
mouth, from bulletin boards in the Stamford area to three other states, with 
more inquiries coming in. It looks like it will spread across the United States 
-- and be the only national support group of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Kweskin, a Stamford attorney and a specialist in family law, is not 
surprised. He is working pro bono with Field to establish Parents Without 
Custody as a nonprofit organization. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, this group sells itself," Kweskin said. "People who go through 
divorce comment on feeling angry, hurt, disenfranchised, confused. And for 
non-custodial parents, not only has a sacred union been destroyed, they've also 
lost the parental prerogatives of guidance and control, and the constancy and 
immediacy of their children's love. It leaves a tremendous void." 
</P>
<P>
Not only an emotional void, but often a practical one as well. Field, for 
example, lost her job over spending so much time in court, and then her home 
when she conceded custody. And she found that there is a ready-made perception 
that goes with the non-custodial parent. 
</P>
<P>
"When people hear you don't have the children, they see you as the guilty 
parent, the bad one," Field said. 
</P>
<P>
Talk during the group meetings centers around common problems with ex-spouses 
and getting information from schools and doctors. One parent talks about how, 
when she tries to call her children at their father's home in a town several 
miles away, all she gets is an answering machine. And when her younger child 
was sick recently and her ex-husband didn't take him to the doctor, she felt 
helpless. "I didn't know what to do. I don't know who his doctor is up there." 
</P>
<P>
Often, non-custodial parents are not getting information from their ex-spouses. 
"These are the same people who got divorced; they still have anger," Kweskin 
said. "They may not overtly interfere, but many act in a passive-aggressive 
manner." For the non-custodial parent, the result is missed report-card 
conferences, school plays, baseball games and ballet recitals.

NEW MAYAN ALPHABET PROVOKES ANGRY LETTERS

<TEXT>
<P>
Almost 1,000 letters and telegrams from people in rural villages, mountains and 
valleys sit on Jose Sanic's desk at the Academy of Mayan Languages in Guatemala 
City. Many warn of serious consequences if a new alphabet for the country's 22 
Mayan languages changes the letters used to represent "w," "q" and "k." Sanic 
smiles wryly and says he is confident that the law will stick and that it is 
the beginning of a resolution to Guatemala's "Indian problem." 
</P>
<P>
Mayans, who prefer the term indigena (native) to Indian, are the majority of 
Guatemala's 8 million people. No more than 600,000 Mayans can read and write in 
any language at any level. In schools where teachers used Spanish, indigenous 
children were thrown into what Eliu Cifuentes, Guatemala's director of 
bilingual education, calls "a violent encounter with literacy, being taught a 
foreign language by a teacher who doesn't speak their tongue." 
</P>
<P>
With President Vinicio Cerezo's election in 1985, the government announced a 
radical change in policy. Spanish will remain the official language, but 
Guatemala will have at least 22 protected languages. As a symbol of its 
commitment to Mayan culture, the government published its new constitution in 
the languages of the four largest Mayan groups -- Mam, Kaqchikel, K'iche' and 
Q'eqchi'. 
</P>
<P>
The bilingual education program, begun as an experiment with funds from the 
United States Agency for International Development, includes 400 schools with 
bilingual classes up to the fourth grade. Cifuentes expects 260,000 students to 
be in the program this year. This would represent more than one-third of all 
rural primary school students. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of so many new readers and writers inspired activists to push for 
what they hoped would be a truly Mayan alphabet. Previous efforts to teach 
Mayan were hobbled by a variety of alphabets, most invented by Europeans and 
North Americans. Many used symbols not found on a typewriter or in a print 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the election, Mayans and their friends in Congress created the 
Academy of Mayan Languages within the Ministry of Culture and Sports. The 
academy's first project was to create a unified Mayan alphabet. 
</P>
<P>
During several meetings organized by the academy, most of the debate focused on 
the letters "w," "k" and "q." In the new alphabet, "w" represents sounds 
previously written with "cua," "gu," "qu" and "v." Sounds previously assigned 
to "q" and "k" in most alphabets were reversed, and the European "qu" has 
disappeared. The Aguacateca are now the Awakateka. The Quiche are now the 
K'iche' (the apostrophe indicates a glottal stop). 
</P>
<P>
Many find no fault with the new alphabet's method of equating one letter to one 
sound -- a generally accepted principle among linguists concerned about 
teaching. But debate over the new alphabet is only one part linguistic; it's 
also political and economic. 
</P>
<P>
At the academy, Sanic said, most of the mail on his desk comes from members of 
evangelical Protestant churches, which claim almost 20% of Guatemala's 
population as members. In many communities, evangelicals and their Mayan 
congregations have a large economic and public relations stake in materials 
published using earlier alphabets. 
</P>
<P>
Mayan activists say it is more important to seize the political opportunities 
than to worry about what they consider nit-picking. Virgilio Ajenal, director 
of the Assn. of Mayan Writers, contended: "The fight is mainly among 
intellectuals. . . . Ninety-nine and nine-tenths of all indigenous people are 
still illiterate, so they will not have to learn anything over." 
</P>
<P>
He said Mayans have listened to outsiders too long. "We don't want outsiders to 
think, to decide and to act for us." As for the value of the material already 
printed, most of it religious, he said: "The people in the countryside cannot 
eat those things." It is time to write practical, how-to-do-it things about 
agriculture and health, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Elliot, director of the Center for Mesoamerican Investigations in 
Antigua, said the need to get on with the new alphabet is exemplified by three 
proposals he received during a week in May. Each asked for help in publishing a 
dictionary of Kaqchikel, each in its own alphabet. "If the energy invested in 
opposing the alphabet were invested in promoting the transition, it would be 
over with," Elliot said. He sums up the debate saying, "It's a matter of what's 
important to us -- the past or the future." 
</P>
<P>
Cifuentes said the country is "trying to find a new national identity." The new 
alphabet is an important part of the process. "We are beginning to end the 
colonization of the language that began 400 years ago," he said.

SPECIAL FOCUS ON GUATEMALAN ILLITERACY

<TEXT>
<P>
Six-year-old Carlitos arrived on time for his first day of primary school in 
San Juan, Comalapa, a small town 50 miles northwest of Guatemala City. But 
despite his desire to learn and the full attention he gave his teacher, he 
couldn't understand a word that was said. The instructor spoke only Spanish and 
Carlitos spoke only Kaqchikel. The teaching method was repetition, not 
participation. 
</P>
<P>
Carlitos, who is now 22 and an economist, remembers that "it was like being in 
a box without an escape." 
</P>
<P>
Fifty percent of his classmates had to repeat first grade. Many took two or 
three years to pass each grade until they reached sixth. Many more gave up. 
Although Guatemala is not the poorest nation in Latin America, it is the second 
most illiterate (Haiti is first) and has the second-highest dropout rate. Less 
than 10% of those who enter first grade graduate from sixth. 
</P>
<P>
"The school itself is the source of illiteracy; it is a center of failure, not 
a center of learning," said Mario Leyton, an education consultant sponsored by 
the United Nations Development Program and the U.N. Educational, Scientific and 
Cultural Organization. "It is the scene of a confrontation of cultures." 
</P>
<P>
The Guatemalan educational system is going through a radical change with the 
support of the almost 3-year-old democratic government of President Vinicio 
Cerezo. The curriculum from preschool to sixth grade is being transformed to 
respond to the needs of the long-neglected Mayan majority of the population. 
</P>
<P>
The Mayan Indians, more than half of whom do not speak Spanish, are further 
distinguished from the mestizos (mixed Spanish descent) by their darker skin, 
their practice of Mayan religion as well as Roman Catholicism and their 
brightly embroidered, traditional clothing. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than promoting the current cultural confrontation and attempting to 
integrate Mayan children into a dominant Western culture, the new curriculum 
will integrate all children into a Guatemalan nationality that is 
pluri-cultural and respects diversity," Leyton said. 
</P>
<P>
Because there are 23 languages and cultures within Guatemala and further 
diversity throughout the various regions, teachers in each school will have the 
freedom to design a curriculum that responds to the needs of their particular 
community. 
</P>
<P>
For example, students in one region may learn mathematics in terms of 
coffee-growing, the occupation most prevalent in the children's families. 
</P>
<P>
The ambitious project began with $200,000 in seed money from United Nations 
Development Program, the financial motivator for further donations, including 
$1.6 million from the Netherlands, $600,000 from the World Bank and $180,000 
from the United States Agency for International Development, in addition to $1 
million from the Guatemalan government. 
</P>
<P>
When the project is completed, teachers from all over the country will have 
participated in the formation of basic but flexible curriculum guides for each 
grade; they will know the language of the students and gradually introduce 
Spanish as a second language while using the native language for instruction in 
the first grade; more participation and practical activities will replace rote 
learning; more visual aids will be used, and the entire process will reflect 
individual community needs, such as classes being held in non-harvest seasons 
when children are not required to work in the fields. 
</P>
<P>
There are many reasons that parents do not keep their children in school. Some 
Mayans see learning Spanish as surrendering to the Spanish conquerors. Others 
lose patience after children repeat the same grade several times. The 
repetition of grades also means a first-grade classroom has students from ages 
6 to 15. 
</P>
<P>
By reducing repetition, the project will make room for more students without 
the need for building new classrooms. At present, the average Guatemalan 
between the ages of 6 and 12 has 2.5 years of schooling; the project hopes to 
raise that to 4 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Success will guarantee economic, social and cultural development of all 
sectors and will thus strengthen the democratic process," Leyton said.

EX-STEWS AGREE: IT WAS FUN UP THERE

<P>
They relived war stories about working under potentially dangerous conditions 
for as little as $1.25 an hour. They recalled the constant uniform and grooming 
checks, and how their work restricted their personal life with the demanding, 
long hours. 
</P>
<P>
But mainly they remembered that for a time, theirs was the most coveted job for 
a woman in the United States. And they were proud to have worn the wings. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 former airline stewardesses met at Promontory Point Clubhouse in 
Newport Beach last weekend in what they called Interline '90, a celebration of 
the 60th anniversary of stewardess service. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen O'Brien, who flew with Braniff in the '60s, said being a stewardess 
was the female equivalent of men playing sports or going to war. 
</P>
<P>
Being a stewardess, she said, "was a bonding thing for women, a way to get 
tested, a way to find out how you would react in an emergency. It wasn't just 
coffee tea or me. It was being responsible for getting people off that plane if 
you had to." 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of women competed for a job that had a relatively good salary, 
unlimited travel and the opportunity to "drench yourself in celebrities and 
sports figures," said Kathy LaBelle, who flew for United Airlines in the early 
'60s. 
</P>
<P>
"To go home and say, 'Guess what, Dad, United selected me,' well you just can't 
imagine," she said. "You were proud to be selected. You knew you were special." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the flying veterans who attended the event said they weren't grounded 
by old age but by marriage. 
</P>
<P>
"It was part of your contract to quit when you married," LaBelle said. "The 
airline's reasoning was purely aesthetics, the myth of the pretty single . . . 
woman who serves the male." 
</P>
<P>
"This used to be a specialty thing with sincere camaraderie," said Gail 
Preston, who flew for United Airlines from 1960 to 1964, retired, then founded 
the Orange County chapter of Clipped Wings, an association of United stewardess 
alumnae. "You took it knowing that when you got married, you could never fly 
again. It was tough, because it was a great job back then." 
</P>
<P>
The story of trading wings for rings was repeated many times by the women who 
ranged in age from late 40s to early 70s. 
</P>
<P>
Held by the 40-member county chapter of Clipped Wings, the festivities included 
an airline fashion show, with ensembles ranging from 1930s conservative dark 
suits to a 1960s navy-blue minidress with bright orange coat, helmet hat and 
tall black boots. 
</P>
<P>
The evening was the county's first inter-airline social event, said Mary K. 
Dana, president of the Clipped Wings chapter, another former stew who quit 
flying to marry. She said although lawsuits alleging discrimination on the 
basis of age, sex and marital status began in the '60s, "it's only been in the 
past few years that the restrictions were lifted." 
</P>
<P>
"In the '30s through the '60s," Dana said, "we just wanted to be a stew, get 
married and live Doris Day (lives), happily forever. Now it's more of a career 
for both males and females, married or not." 
</P>
<P>
"We lived in a bubble," said LaBelle, who is now a CPA and divorced. "On one 
end, you had some women demonstrating for equal rights on college campuses. On 
the other end, being a stewardess was the most coveted job in the United 
States." 
</P>
<P>
Memories were dished out throughout dinner as the veterans from Pan Am, 
Braniff, United and TWA ate pastas and traded tales of glamorous days gone by. 
</P>
<P>
Sally Vigal, who started her three-year career in 1949, said she flew then on a 
27-seat DC-3 that skimmed snowy mountaintops at low altitudes, landing 14 times 
between Denver and Chicago. Next she graduated to DC-6 sleepers with a lounge 
at the tail. 
</P>
<P>
"They were big beautiful things that seated 104 people," she said. "It was just 
like a train. We'd point out all the sights, then pull down the berths and 
they'd go to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
It all began in 1930, when eight registered nurses became the first female 
flight attendants on a U.S. airline, Boeing Air Transport, a United Airlines 
forerunner, said Dana, who displayed a picture poster with a caption that said 
the dream of every young man was to marry an airline stewardess. 
</P>
<P>
"These were daring young women in those days," she said. "Except for nurses, 
most women didn't even leave home." 
</P>
<P>
But their boldness had to be wrapped in a young and dainty package. Besides 
being required to be unmarried nurses, the original stews had to weigh less 
than 115 pounds, stand shorter than 5 feet, 4 inches and be younger than 25. 
</P>
<P>
The monthly salary was $125 for 100 hours of flying time in 10-seat tri-motor 
planes that reached a maximum of 125 m.p.h., Dana said, as she set the stage 
for a fellow Clipped Wings member who was to model the first uniform, a 
green-caped affair with beret jauntily tilted above one eye. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of women attendants was the brainchild of Ellen Church, a nurse who 
proposed the idea to Steve Stimpson, a San Francisco division traffic agent for 
Boeing Air Transport. 
</P>
<P>
In 1930, Stimpson wrote a letter to a company official rhapsodizing a concept 
of women attendants and the advantage of having nurses to treat air sickness. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine the psychology of having young women as regular members of the crew," 
the letter said. "Imagine the national publicity we could get from it, and the 
tremendous effect it would have on the traveling public. Also, imagine the 
value they would be to us in the neater and nicer method of serving food and 
looking out for the passengers' welfare." 
</P>
<P>
Stimpson's superiors at first thought it was a "ridiculous idea" but finally 
consented to a trial program with Church and seven other nurses, Dana said. 
</P>
<P>
"The passengers loved it," she said. "Pilots were converted. And the other 
airlines quickly hopped aboard and employed young nurses, a requirement that 
stayed in effect through World War II." 
</P>
<P>
Bunny Fifer, a registered nurse then working in Sacramento, was hired by United 
in 1939, with an annual salary of $1,500. A scrapbook she made holds photos of 
passengers to whom she served three-course meals, including Bud Abbott, Lou 
Costello, Rita Hayworth and Walt Disney. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved every minute of it," she said. "We were treated like celebrities. 
Every time we walked down the street people would say 'Oh, there's a 
stewardess.' " 
</P>
<P>
Grooming rules were very strict, Fifer said: Hair couldn't touch the collar, 
earrings weren't allowed and uniforms with blue-and-white shoes had to look 
"just so." 
</P>
<P>
"We were on inspection every time we went through the terminal," she said. "And 
passengers really got dressed up to fly then, with hats and the whole bit." 
</P>
<P>
The Clipped Wings members are glad married women can now fly, but they bemoan 
other changes. "It's not as personal or prestigious any more," said Preston, 
who is now a technical administrator for a computer company. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be 30 or 40 people in the back of the plane to Denver for four 
hours. Now it's 200 people and takes an hour. It has lost its cachet." 
</P>
<P>
"In the old days," Vigal said, "we played bridge, took care of babies and knew 
everyone's names by the time they got off the plane. Now you have huge 
airplanes, huge crews and stewardesses work much harder. It's just not the 
same." 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Pavitt, who flew for TWA, agreed. "Stewardesses today are missing 
out," she said with a clipped English accent. "We have bigger and better 
airplanes, but you lose something. It's that feeling of belonging. 
</P>
<P>
"But if I were 20 now, I'd still want to fly."
