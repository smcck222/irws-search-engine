BLEEDING THE BEAR MARKET CRIMSON; 
</P>
<P>
A TENURED PROFESSOR BY JOHN KENNETH GALBRAITH (HOUGHTON MIFFLIN: $18.95; 197

By Timothy Carlson, Carlson, a 1971 graduate of Harvard College, once attended 
a Galbraith lecture on economics but decided it would be more profitable to 
read his book rather than take the course. Carlson is a staff writer at TV 
Guide.

<TEXT>
<P>
A witty novel about a liberal economist and his activist wife who make a splash 
as corporate raiders with a conscience hardly seems likely to be optioned as 
the next Oliver Stone project. If the movie "Wall Street" was a heavy-metal 
take on greed, the novel "A Tenured Professor" is Cole Porter pricking the egos 
and satirizing the follies of the latest mergers-and-acquisitions gunslingers 
and envious academics. 
</P>
<P>
The wry ironies of distinguished liberal economist John Kenneth Galbraith's 
third work of fiction are a healthy antidote to the metaphor inflation required 
to keep up with the numbers generated in the era of junk-bond excess. In this 
book, Galbraith's mild-mannered academics deftly outswim and outbite the sharks 
of leveraged buyouts. And while doing their subtle best to subvert the values 
of the Reagan revolution, they ironically become one of its prime 
beneficiaries, using the same tax cuts that fueled GOP investors. 
</P>
<P>
Prof. Montgomery Marvin and his wife Marjie carefully disguise their 
radical-liberal agenda as he gains tenure at Harvard University for his 
relatively innocuous theories on refrigerator pricing. But hell breaks loose 
when Marvin devises the Index of Irrational Expectations (IRAT), which turns 
out to be an infallible predictor of inflated stocks, a vast improvement on the 
Hemline Index or Super Bowl Indexes -- not to mention anything more realistic 
or more technical. 
</P>
<P>
When the Marvins start churning out millions selling short on stocks that were 
buoyed by euphoric yahoos, they have the ammunition to make liberal waves. They 
fund professorships of peace at the three service academies, pressure 
corporations to hire women executives, buy out South African stocks from the 
Harvard endowment, and provide funding to neutralize every Political Action 
Committee-supported candidate in the land. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, they take on a defense contractor and stop it from making parts for 
Star Wars, and start controlling a few TV stations. Before Congress decides to 
do something about the un-American nature of the Marvins' capitalizing on 
failure, The Wall Street Journal deals them the harshest blow -- praising them 
for following in the footsteps of Cornelius Vanderbilt and John D. Rockefeller. 
</P>
<P>
Galbraith's prose style is the very model of the British writer-statesman: 
lean, lucid and flavored by a dry wit seen best in writers like Richard 
Crossman and Duff Cooper, and in this country matched only perhaps by former 
Harvard colleague Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
Galbraith reverses some popular fictions seen in TV and movie financiers such 
as J. R. Ewing and Gordon Gekko: that the cash nexus is either just a pretense 
or a substitute for overgrown sexual appetite. For Galbraith, the chase of 
money is more like courtship than rape, more cerebral and less primal. As for 
sex itself, there is a great throwaway line about the Marvins: 
</P>
<P>
"Their sex life was normal, thus uninteresting and, remarkably in this age, 
undiscussed." 
</P>
<P>
As for their courtship style, it is far closer to Henry James than D. H. 
Lawrence: 
</P>
<P>
Marjie, clad in denim jacket and "workmanlike" skirt, picks Montgomery out of a 
crowd in Vienna because he is reading Joseph Schumpeter's "Capitalism, 
Socialism and Democracy," in which he had "taken refuge from Freud's letters." 
</P>
<P>
"Very reactionary," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Not altogether. He's kind to Marx, says here that 'he was a very learned man.' 
That's not bad." 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, but the book is a hymn of praise for capitalism, even though he thinks 
the system won't survive. But it's too nice a morning to argue." 
</P>
<P>
Galbraith, a Paul M. Warburg professor of economics emeritus at Harvard and 
former ambassador to India under John Kennedy, is of course famed for his two 
major books on economics -- "The New Industrial State" and "The Affluent 
Society" -- as well as a book analyzing the great crash of 1929. More recently, 
Galbraith wrote an article in Atlantic Monthly that analyzed the 1986-87 bull 
market in terms suspiciously like his novel's Index of Irrational Expectations 
-- a piece that was eerily prescient of the the October 19, 1987, crash. 
</P>
<P>
While Galbraith remains one of the respected postwar economists, he is seen 
more as a sociologist and popularizer than a groundbreaking specialist in the 
field by many of his narrowly focused contemporaries. Galbraith, who grew up 
under modest circumstances on a Canadian farm, always has been able to move 
within privileged worlds, but was never of them. Thus, while he is perceived by 
many as a tall Brahmin Harvard insider -- after all, he was one of Jackie 
Kennedy's escorts -- he always has stood apart from clubbiness wherever he 
found it. 
</P>
<P>
The book benefits from Galbraith's essential outsider perspective in several 
ways. One, he is not embarrassed to populate the novel with at least as many 
real-life references as does E. L. Doctorow, while having the modesty and good 
taste not to give most of them imaginary dialogue. Galbraith invokes economists 
Maynard Keynes, Paul Samuelson, Arthur Laffer and Milton Friedman as well as 
the recent icons of greed -- Bernie Cornfeld, Donald Trump, Michael Milken, 
Carl Icahn, Robert Campeau, T. Boone Pickens, Ivan Boesky, Dennis Levine. But 
he does have William F. Buckley and Ralph Nader commenting on the Marvins -- 
presumably with permission. 
</P>
<P>
As for the dangerous device of setting much of this novel at Harvard (books 
that try to portray Harvard life profoundly are inevitably mediocre because 
they have a Harvard audience secretly in mind), Galbraith largely escapes. He 
shows how the Marvins use Harvard, while they are never overwhelmed by it. 
Still, he cannot resist telling the reader how the university resisted naming a 
residential house after President Leonard Hoar, how the faculty club used to 
serve horse meat and how John Kennedy lost points among the faithful when he 
referred to the Harvard "campus" in a speech -- rather than the solemnly 
traditional Harvard Yard. 
</P>
<P>
Thankfully, not too much narrative drive is lost wading through Harvardiana. 
But the old professor of economics, like the Marvins, wouldn't mind being the 
beneficiary of some built-in sales from the Harvard folk he is satirizing.

PLAYING FAUST TO NORIEGA'S SATAN; 
</P>

OUR MAN IN PANAMA: HOW GENERAL NORIEGA USED THE UNITED STATES AND MADE MILLIONS

0-394-54910-4);

DIVORCING THE DICTATOR: AMERICA'S BUNGLED AFFAIR WITH NORIEGA BY FREDERICK 
KEMPE (G. P. PUTNAM'S SONS: $24.95; 469 PP.; 0-399-13517-0) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Doyle McManus, McManus is a correspondent in the Washington bureau of The 
Times and co-author (with Jane Mayer) of Landslide: The Unmaking of the 
President, 1984-1988 (Houghton Mifflin). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the mind of America, Manuel Antonio Noriega has become the stuff of myth, 
one of a select few foreign demons (Kadafi and Khomeini are others) who menace 
the civilized world with boundless evil. Against such demons, any sanction is 
justified, including last December's invasion of Panama by the United States 
Army and Marines -- an unprecedented use of American military power to 
overthrow and capture a single villain. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Noriega is a nasty man: a tyrant, a murderer and a drug profiteer 
(not to mention, as did one U.S. general in Panama, a devotee of voodoo and a 
wearer of red undershorts). But today, with benefit of hindsight, it is 
astonishing that President Bush -- or anyone else in the U.S. government -- 
could have condemned the crimes of Manuel Antonio Noriega with a completely 
straight face. For, as these two admirably reported books on Noriega show, the 
Panamanian dictator was known to U.S. officials as a bad apple for 30 years -- 
three decades during which the same officials consistently elected to ignore 
the evidence and continue using Noriega as an intelligence source and sometime 
drug-enforcement ally. 
</P>
<P>
When then-Vice President Bush protested during his 1988 campaign that he was 
unfairly tagged as Noriega's friend -- that seven administrations, beginning 
with Eisenhower, had dealt with the man -- it turns out he was right. But Bush 
drew the wrong lesson (or, more precisely, no lesson at all) from his own 
history. The wonder is not that Noriega hid his evil nature from so many 
Presidents and CIA directors, but that so many administrations had at least 
fragmentary evidence of his nastiness and chose not to pursue the matter. 
</P>
<P>
The record, set forth more clearly in these detailed accounts than ever before, 
is an infuriating cycle of sin and bureaucratic redemption. For 30 years, the 
wily Panamanian plotter engaged in nearly every variety of corruption, but 
until 1988, he always made himself just useful enough to the United States to 
win official absolution. 
</P>
<P>
As early as 1960, according to Frederick Kempe, Noriega's U.S. intelligence 
contact learned that his new Panamanian agent had been arrested for raping and 
beating a prostitute; Noriega stayed on the payroll. 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, both John Dinges and Kempe note, the Nixon Administration's Bureau of 
Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs compiled a strong case against Noriega for 
protecting a marijuana pipeline through Panama. But by then, Noriega was 
already Panama's chief of military intelligence, and no conclusive action was 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
By 1980, the U.S. attorney in Miami was ready to indict Noriega for gunrunning, 
but the Carter Administration blocked the case -- in part because Noriega had 
been helpful in sheltering the outcast shah of Iran. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Noriega directed the Panama Defense Force's flagrant theft of a 
presidential election for a candidate owned by the military; a pair of 
hard-working U.S. diplomats even documented the fraud. But the Reagan 
Administration favored the military's candidate, too, and ignored its own 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Not until 1987, when the cumulative outrage of Noriega's rule drove many 
normally placid Panamanians into the streets -- and, perhaps more important, 
when the cocaine epidemic suddenly became a potent political issue in the 
United States -- did the Reagan Administration turn against Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
There are two mysterious characters in this story. One is Noriega, the 
endlessly crafty abandoned child of Panama City's slums, ugly protege of the 
charismatic strongman Omar Torrijos, master dealer in information, political 
manipulator extraordinaire -- but, all in all, a trivial figure on the stage of 
history. 
</P>
<P>
The other, more important character is ourselves. Noriega may have been a 
devil, but the United States government was the Faust that somehow found itself 
drawn to bargain with him time and time again. And, in a sense, our deals with 
Noriega mirror every ugly little trade-off U.S. foreign policy makes in the 
Third World; most of them simply never go quite this horribly wrong. 
</P>
<P>
The story of Noriega is colorful, exotic and, thanks to Panama's luxurious 
profusion of lurid rumors, easy to tell. The story of our own vulnerabilities 
is more complicated and subtle, harder to get, but surely more important. 
</P>
<P>
Both of these books are built, irresistibly, around the Noriega saga. But 
Kempe, a correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, seems to have been the one 
more seduced by the devil Noriega; Dinges, a reporter for National Public 
Radio, does a better job of focusing on the United States as a confused and 
inattentive Faust. 
</P>
<P>
Both have unearthed considerable new information. Kempe provides a wealth of 
detail, especially, on the painful (and abortive) U.S.-Noriega negotiations 
over the past two years, as well as the unsuccessful anti-Noriega coup of 
October, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Dinges has done some admirable investigative work, often using the Freedom of 
Information Act, as when he reveals a secret State Department report that 
showed conclusively that Noriega's men stole Panama's presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
And he has a provocative new thesis: that Noriega, far from being a drug 
kingpin, actually disengaged from active complicity in cocaine trafficking 
beginning in 1984, when he realized that the issue might endanger his 
relationship with the United States. (The "cocaine" seized from his office 
refrigerator by U.S. troops last December, for example, turned out to be frozen 
tamales.) 
</P>
<P>
The final irony, in Dinges' view, is that the U.S. decision to oust Noriega was 
as incoherent as the earlier decisions to coddle him. The Reagan Administration 
allowed two federal prosecutors in Florida to go ahead and indict the general 
even though some aides warned the action would be a foreign-policy disaster. 
Why? Because, Dinges argues persuasively, in the aftermath of the Iran-Contra 
affair -- and with drugs becoming a major issue in the 1988 campaign -- no one 
dared to suggest blocking the indictments. 
</P>
<P>
"The use of massive military force in December, 1989, that brought Noriega's 
rule to an end was the final proof of the failure of American foreign policy in 
Panama," Kempe writes. 
</P>
<P>
But the failure may go one step further. In part because Bush has quite deftly 
turned his sad experience in Panama into a 24-hour military triumph, it is not 
at all clear that the lessons of the previous 30 years of failure have been 
learned.

BRASILIA AND THE BURIAL OF UTOPIA; 
</P>
<P>
THE MODERNIST CITY: AN ANTHROPOLOGICAL CRITIQUE OF BRASILIA BY JAMES HOLSTON 
(UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS: $50, CLOTH; $18.95, PAPER; 432 PP., ILLUSTRATED; 
0-226-34978-0)

By Peter Hall, Hall, who teaches city planning at Berkeley, is author of Cities 
of Tomorrow: An Intellectual History of Urban Planning and Design in the 
Twentieth Century (Blackwell). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The academic publishing world seems awash with books about postmodernism. Not 
only architectural critics -- geographers and sociologists and general 
historical doomsayers also are banding to make it the hot topic of early 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Many of their readers may find themselves more bemused at the end than when 
they started. For postmodernism seems to have become a kind of code word for 
everything these authors dislike in contemporary capitalism but cannot quite 
elucidate. 
</P>
<P>
At least two hurrahs, therefore, for James Holston. An assistant professor at 
the University of Southern California, he utters the P-word only in his last 
couple of pages. His subject matter is at first sight specialized, even 
obscure: the creation in the late 1950s of the new Brazilian capital, in the 
empty plains about 600 miles from Rio de Janeiro. But, by dissecting the 
phenomenon that postmodernism supplanted, he indirectly illuminates the subject 
far more satisfactorily than any of his competitors so far. 
</P>
<P>
Holston comes unusually well qualified, with a degree in both architecture and 
anthropology, so he can analyze Brasilia, as an architectural project, from the 
standpoint and with the techniques of an anthropologist. He argues that 
modernism -- the architectural movement that began with Le Corbusier, Gropius 
and all the other heroes of the 1920s, culminated in the Congres Internationaux 
d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM) in the 1930s, and effectively ended with the 
demolition of the Pruitt-Igoe project in St. Louis in 1972 -- had a very 
radical social and political intent: It was a project to replace capitalism by 
a new collectivist social order. 
</P>
<P>
This, oddly, could happen under very different political regimes: It was true 
alike in the Soviet Union and in Fascist Italy in the 1920s, and (though he 
does not say this) in Social-Democratic Stockholm and London in the 1950s. It 
is also specifically true in Brasilia. Though President Juscelino Kubitschek, 
the city's godfather, was a Latin American populist, the true begetter of the 
Brasilia plan was Oscar Niemeyer, doyen of Brazilian architects and an avowed 
Communist. He persuaded the competition jury to accept the plan of his teacher 
Lucio Costa, written on five index cards. 
</P>
<P>
This plan, according to Holston, was the ultimate political achievement of the 
modern movement, "a CIAM city . . . the most complete example ever constructed 
of the architectural and planning tenets put forward in CIAM manifestoes"; it 
achieved the objective for which the pioneers of the modern movement had 
struggled in vain. Its hidden agenda was to create a totally new-built form as 
a shell for a new society, without reference to history: The past was simply to 
be abolished. "Brasilia," he writes, "was built to be more than the symbol of 
this new age. Rather, its design and construction were intended as a means to 
create it by transforming Brazilian society." 
</P>
<P>
Brasilia thus embodied a fundamental premise of the modern movement: "total 
decontextualization," in which a utopian future becomes the means to measure 
the present, without any sense of historical context. Costa introduces his 
plan, in disarmingly self-effacing fashion, as the carrier of a mythic idea 
that came to him almost as a vision: It provides a basis for a city created on 
a clean slate, without reference to the past. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, in this new city the traditional, heavily stratified Brazilian 
society would be replaced by a totally egalitarian one: In the uniform 
apartment blocks, governors and ambassadors would live as neighbors with 
janitors and laborers. The apartments marked a radical break with 
class-conscious tradition: Masters and servants would use the same entrances, 
even share the same spaces. 
</P>
<P>
The traditional divisions between public and private space would be abolished; 
these blocks would be machines for collective public living. And the 
traditional street -- the age-old essence of the division between public and 
private life -- must likewise disappear; hence Brasilia's eight-lane 
expressways, which act as social divisors rather than social integrators. 
</P>
<P>
On this hidden agenda of modernism, Holston is extraordinarily persuasive. He 
illuminates, in a depth and with a subtlety no architectural critic ever has 
achieved, just what the true program of the modern architectural movement was. 
Why high-rise structures with curtain walls of glass? To erode the private life 
of the family, and collectivize the children down in the communal play spaces 
and creches. Why vast expressways and shopping centers? To emphasize the death 
of the street, and with it the subtle relationships between public and private 
space. 
</P>
<P>
The aim was indeed radical, even subversive: "to restructure the institutional 
relationships between the public and the private domains of social life so that 
they are both entirely regulated by a comprehensive, state-sponsored master 
plan," thus transforming the structure of capitalist society by stealth. Small 
wonder that modernism came into its own only in totalitarian regimes, or in 
municipal collectivist local states. 
</P>
<P>
But in Brasilia, it could not work. The deep class structures of Brazil, subtly 
racial in origin, reasserted themselves. The manual workers who built the city, 
and were temporarily glorified as heroes, were banished from it; after epic 
fights, they were allowed to remain in distant satellite towns, totally 
segregated from middle-class Brasilian society, spending much of their meager 
salaries on long commutes. 
</P>
<P>
The servants who remained in the superblocks, ironically, were cooped up in 
closet spaces far worse than the rooms they had enjoyed in traditional 
apartments. Some of this story has been told, and told well, in previous 
accounts of Brasilia. But Holston invests it, too, with new layers of meaning. 
</P>
<P>
What is its significance for the project of postmodernism? Here, at the very 
end, Holston is tantalizingly and disappointingly laconic. Radical 
postmodernists argue that the new aesthetic requires a total social revolution 
for its achievement: an irony, since modernism itself tried to engineer just 
such a revolution through the effect of built forms on the psyche. Conservative 
postmodernists, led by Prince Charles, conversely call for a return to 
preindustrial-built forms. Both, Holston argues, are utopian: Either they 
ignore their own historical context, or, worse, they exacerbate the problems 
they purport to solve. And so, ironically, they fall into the same trap as the 
modernists before them. 
</P>
<P>
That may be oversimplistic, a quality certainly not found elsewhere in this 
book. (If there is a criticism, it is that the style is often too academically 
inflated, too prolix and unnecessarily complex; qualities that doubtless 
reflect the book's origin as a Ph.D. dissertation.) Modernism's demise surely 
reflects a complex counter-reaction from a number of disparate forces: bored 
young architects seeking something new, angry tenants of public-housing 
projects revolting against the collectivist violence done on them, and, more 
subtly, a new Zeitgeist that elevates the whimsical and the ironic and the 
transient above the solid and the serious. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, the exposure of modernism's failings in practice -- especially 
through the serious media -- played a critical role. But there was more to it 
than that. Perhaps, unconsciously, people came to appreciate the hidden agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the cause, the triumph of postmodernism is surely an integral part of 
a huge political sea-change, marked also by the triumph of Thatcho-Reaganism 
and the toppling of collectivism in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
There is much more to be written on it; Holston's next book, maybe.

<P>
CENTURY'S END: A CULTURAL HISTORY OF THE FIN DE SIECLE FROM THE 990S THROUGH 
THE 1990S BY HILLEL SCHWARTZ (DOUBLEDAY: $22.95; 397 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Thomas Cahill, Cahill, who has been for many years a publisher of calendars, 
is editor of The Bookperson, a new mail-order book review.

<TEXT>
<P>
Where will you be on that fateful midnight when the bells ring in the year 
2000? 
</P>
<P>
If you don't want to be left out (with the other 6 billion nobodies who will by 
then be occupying the planet), you'd better make your plans now. If yours is an 
apocalyptic cast of mind, you may wish to book a seat on Richard Kieninger's 
fleet of blimps, now being assembled at Adelphi, Tex. From your blimp window, 
you will have a comfortable view of the calamities erupting below -- quakes, 
volcanoes, tidal waves, and similar consequences of the "catastrophic shift in 
the Earth's axis" that Kieninger expects in due course. 
</P>
<P>
If, on the other hand, you think that Cosmic Consciousness is just around the 
corner, you may prefer to gather at one of several "planetary light-body grid 
nodes" (Mayan ruins are especially good for this) with like-minded "dancing 
suns," all celebrating the Great Harmonic Convergence predicted by art 
historian Jose Arguelles. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, as Hillel Schwartz points out in his new book, there are sundry 
alternatives. Of these, my favorite is the plan of the Millennium Society, a 
bunch of Republican Yalies (Class of '79) who have reserved the Great Pyramid 
of Cheops for a smasheroo New Year's Eve party of 3,000 hand-picked optimists. 
These optimists, who will include a complement of the world's "most inspiring" 
people (Deng Xiaoping, Bruce Springsteen, John Paul II, George Burns, Steven 
Spielberg and Cory Aquino have all been invited), are to set sail at the Winter 
Solstice 1999 from New York Harbor aboard (you guessed it) the Queen Elizabeth 
II. But . . . if the ship doesn't sink like the Titanic (that earlier barque of 
cheery conservatives), those on board will surely drown in their own 
fatuousness. 
</P>
<P>
What, exactly, will they be celebrating? 
</P>
<P>
To answer this question, we must turn to the beginning of Schwartz's book, 
where he gives us the following picture of the current millennium's inception 
-- the eve of the year 1000: 
</P>
<P>
"Once upon a time," he begins, "the people of Europe were stricken with panic. 
The end of the millennium, so it is thought, had long been anticipated by 
prophets, prelates, monks, mathematicians, soothsayers, and surveyors of stars. 
None of them had anything good to say about Anno Domini 1000, for the world 
that year was to be drawn to its catastrophic conclusion . . . Debts were 
forgiven, convicts released from prison, men and women absolved of their 
infidelities." 
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible at this late day," Schwartz quotes a 19th-Century historian, 
"to imagine the terror that reigned throughout Christendom as the thousandth 
year from the birth of Christ approached." 
</P>
<P>
After pages of such detail, Schwartz gives us the real dope. "None of this is 
true," he announces without warning (unless you heeded the warning of his first 
four words). Apocalyptic expectations for the year 1000 cannot be traced to 
contemporary records. Indeed, the turn of the millennium came and went pretty 
much without comment in a world that could neither read nor count. The legend 
of universal panic must be laid to the quills of some fanciful clergymen of the 
late 16th Century, anachronistically reading their own fears into an earlier 
age. 
</P>
<P>
This rhetorical bouleversement of Schwartz's -- setting us up, then knocking us 
down -- becomes his method throughout. And, if as a method it is fraught with 
peril, it also makes for a book full of entertainment. For "Century's End" is 
replete with divertissements -- the "fun facts" of the new genre of 
infotainment. 
</P>
<P>
Dionysius Exiguus (whose name Schwartz translates snappily as "Denis the 
Diminutive"), a 6th-Century Roman canonist, was the first to calculate our era 
from the birth of Jesus, which calculation he superimposed on the existing 
12-month, 365-day Roman calendar, reformed long before by Julius Caesar. 
(Unfortunately, the little canonist was almost certainly off by a few years.) 
</P>
<P>
The term AD (Anno Domini, In the Year of the Lord) was first used in AD 664 in 
the documents of the watershed Synod of Whitby, at which the Celto-British 
church bowed to the greater apostolic authority of the Roman church. Long after 
Europe had accepted this dating of its calendar, regional custom continued to 
dictate when the New Year began -- in Rome on Christmas Eve, in Florence on 
March 25th (the celebration of Jesus' conception), in Byzantium as late as 
Sept. 24th. The Iberians, at length, won out with their celebration of Jesus' 
first shedding of blood at his circumcision (Jan. 1). 
</P>
<P>
By 1582, the calendar was so out of whack (because of the earlier -- and flawed 
-- Julian reform) that Pope Gregory XIII found it necessary to suppress 10 
days, proclaiming that Oct. 4 would be succeeded immediately by Oct. 15 that 
year. Thus, there came into existence the designation N.S. (New Style) for 
Gregory's correction. Protestant countries, however, refused to accept this 
papist innovation and trudged resolutely on in their O.S. (Old Style), England 
holding out until 1752. However admirable their resistance, the two systems of 
dating, occurring side by side, are a chronic grief to students of history. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its eleemosynary richness of fact, "Century's End" provides its 
readers with a fascinating focus for their own meditations on endings and 
beginnings and on the variety of human responses to symbolic milestones. 
Because of their colorful mien, Schwartz cannot help but concentrate on the 
extremists, whether apocalyptic or millennarian. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, there is little of either in evidence before the end of the 13th 
Century. But from then on, as literacy and leisure rise, each century's end 
seems to swarm with designer prophecies. As one reads through the evidence, it 
becomes ever clearer that the prophets are awfully simple folk, men and women 
dazzled by the compelling autonomy of numbers. None is simpler than our beloved 
ex-President Ronald Reagan, whom Schwartz quotes as telling an official of the 
American-Israel PAC: "You know (all Reagan sentences begin with "you know" or 
"well") I turn back to your ancient prophets in the Old Testament and the signs 
foretelling Armageddon, and I find myself wondering if -- if we're the 
generation that's going to see that come about. I don't know if you've noted 
any of those prophecies lately but, believe me, they certainly describe the 
times we're going through." 
</P>
<P>
Uh, which ancient prophets do you have in mind, Mr. President? Could you name 
one? (Armageddon appears nowhere in the Old Testament and but once in the New 
-- in the Book of Revelation, which, if Mr. Reagan were to attempt to read it 
through, would give him a terrible headache.) 
</P>
<P>
To Reagan's embrace of Armageddon and to all similar calculations, one may 
oppose the question of Paul Harvey, Renaissance physician: "But is it credible 
that the extreme dismal state of the world, or any utter casualty of so mighty 
consequence, should in very deed depend upon the fickle state of numbers and 
figures?" 
</P>
<P>
The answer is obvious. Our calendrical numbers, whether Jewish or Roman or 
Islamic or Christian, are merely convenient designations, arbitrary as applied 
to the years of our history, no more meaningful than the number of drawers in a 
filing cabinet. They can speak to us neither of coming retribution nor coming 
rapture. They cannot speak at all. 
</P>
<P>
But Schwartz answers Harvey thus: "The answer is yes, it is credible. Or 
rather, yes, it had become credible, thanks to astromusicians, almaniacs, 
pansophisticates, Christorians, mathemagicians, kabbalanthropists, a 
calendaring pope, and a hybrid host of other centuriators." Thanks, in other 
words, to a great gaggle (except for that "calendaring pope," who was only 
trying to put things in order) of mystifiers and obscurantists. 
</P>
<P>
Here I part company with Schwartz, who has been such a genial guide. The 
problem with this book is that it is a tourist's view of history, in which we 
check in and out quickly, and all centuries become, in the end, more or less 
the same -- same terrific ambience, same great local characters. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz gets important things wrong. He never seems to notice the profound 
difference between oral and literate civilization, perhaps the central dividing 
line in human perceptions and measurement of time.

A WINTER PALETTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding "A Winter Palette," by Robert Smaus (Jan. 14), Clarification please: 
This is an interesting, well-illustrated article. 
</P>
<P>
But the first sentence on Page 24 says, "then re-roots them in empty pots." 
</P>
<P>
Do these rosettes send out roots in pots with no soil, and are then potted in 
the described soil mix? 
</P>
<P>
BOB SCHWEIGHARDT 
</P>
<P>
Escondido 
</P>
<P>
Believe it or not, that is exactly what the Walkers do -- they put the rosettes 
in empty pots so the roots have a chance to sprout without the danger of 
rotting, which might be caused by moisture in a soil medium. After the roots 
are an inch or so long, they put the cuttings in more-conventional, soil-filled 
pots.

<TEXT>
<P>
Van de Kamp's upholding of laws only comes into play if he perceives that those 
issues are politically expedient. He perceives pro-death penalty and 
pro-abortion positions as winning votes, so he subordinates his "deep 
convictions" and backs these measures. 
</P>
<P>
On gun control he perceives that an anti-gun position will help, so he actively 
tries to make laws backing that view. I did notice, however, that he gave up 
pursuing appeals regarding Medi-Cal funding of abortions at about the time he 
decided to run for governor. How convenient. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of running for governor, Van de Kamp should resign! No matter how you 
disguise him, how you try to sweep his record under the rug, Van de Kamp still 
quacks.

MUSHROOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding your article "Taming Wild Mushrooms," by Russ Parsons (Food, Jan. 
14): To my delight more area restaurants are serving wild mushrooms and in 
increasingly interesting ways. No longer are we confronted with only the 
commercial button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) -- we are seeing oyster 
mushrooms, chanterelles, boletes, morels and even the much-prized truffle 
appear on restaurant menus. 
</P>
<P>
However, many restaurants are listing these gems of the earth only as "wild 
mushrooms" with no thought of a proper identification. While there are a few 
restaurants that take time to learn about what mushrooms they are about to 
recommend (Michael's in Santa Monica, for one), most do not. Imagine, for 
example, being handed a menu that lists "fresh fish," and when you ask what 
fish it is, you are offhandedly told, "It's from the ocean," but not whether 
it's shark or salmon. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, I went to a Polish restaurant that features wild mushrooms. I was 
looking forward to this as Poland is a large consumer of wild mushrooms and I 
figured that there I would find an authentic mushroom dining experience. Much 
to my surprise, when I asked what mushrooms were being served, I was told that 
they were "from the forest." When I persisted, I was told that they were wild 
and I probably wouldn't know them. Now, as an avid mycophagist and as a past 
president of the Los Angeles Mycological Society, I felt challenged, but not 
wanting to disrupt an anniversary dinner I simply ordered an entree that 
featured "wild mushrooms." When my dish arrived, I saw no wild mushrooms at all 
-- only commercial button mushrooms. I checked the plates of the others in my 
party and noted that even though they also had ordered dishes with wild 
mushrooms, none existed. I guess you could say that the moral of this is know 
thy morel.

<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding "Weekly Ritual," by Paddy Calistro (Looks, Jan. 14): Weekly ritual? I 
would love to go back to being pampered and beautified weekly at a salon. But 
where to go? Any woman who is a victim of California salons sighed 
nostalgically at "Steel Magnolias," where women who went into Dolly Parton's 
salon actually looked better when they left than when they walked in the door. 
</P>
<P>
California hairdressers seem to be trained to do only three different 
hairstyles, max. Forget what the customers ask for; forget pictures they bring; 
forget everything but getting them in and out of the salon as fast as the 
stylist can, dripping wet if the stylist has his or her way. (That way we can't 
see what's been done until after we've paid.) 
</P>
<P>
I have looked for 10 years in Orange County for a stylist who could send me 
from the shop looking well-groomed, in a style that resembled something worn in 
the 1980s. Even a style that lasted as far as the parking lot would be a plus. 
</P>
<P>
I've been sliced, diced, frizzed and fried. And, like everyone else I know, 
I've invariably had to go home and restyle my hair myself. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is so consistent it has to be the training -- or glaring lack of it 
-- in California. When I moved here, I was appalled when I saw the hair of far 
too many California women damaged, shapeless, badly cut and frumpy. I couldn't 
understand why they didn't take any pride in themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Now I understand. I don't have a jet on which to zip off to another state for a 
hair style, so I now have hair that is shredded, frizzed and so damaged it 
looks like hay (even though it isn't colored, and I religiously condition it). 
</P>
<P>
How come a state that exports glamour via Hollywood can't get more 
sophisticated hairdressing skills to rub off on the hairdressers it licenses 
for the rest of us?

SKIES OF WINTER NIGHTS

<BYLINE>
<P>
By DUODUO, From Looking Out From Death: From the Cultural Revolution to 
Tiananmen Square, the New Chinese Poetry of Duoduo (Bloomsbury Publishing Ltd., 
2 Soho Square, London W1V 5DE, United Kingdom: 128 pp.; 0-7475-0555-1), 
translated by Gregory Lee and John Cayley. Duoduo (original name: Li Shizheng) 
took as his pen name the name of his daughter, who died in her infancy. He was 
born in 1951 and has spent most of his life in Beijing, where he works on a 
national newspaper. Though much of his poetry is not overtly political, he is 
controversial by dint of close association with the group of younger, modernist 
poets of whom the best known is Bei Dao. Duoduo, 1989. Translation Gregory Lee 
and John Cayley, 1989. Reprinted by permission of Bloomsbury Publishing Ltd.

'SUN' AND SEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was very disappointed in Carolyn See's review of "The Sun in Capricorn." 
After recounting glowing quotes from other authors, Ms. See writes, "On the 
other hand, the Watermark press operates out of Wichita, Kan. . . . " What if 
she had said, "On the other hand, the book was written by a black (or Jew or 
woman) . . . " It is just another form of discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
And she doesn't stop there. See finds it so inconceivable that a book of any 
merit could be published in Wichita that she concludes by saying, " 'The Sun in 
Capricorn' was published in Wichita. That has to tell you something." What does 
she say when Simon &amp; Schuster publishes a book she dislikes, "Gee, I can't 
imagine why it isn't good. After all, it was published in New York." 
</P>
<P>
It makes no difference that Wichita is "not the publishing capital of the 
United States"; a book review should be based on the merits (or lack thereof) 
of the writing, not on petty regional stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
Good luck, Watermark! You're going to need it.

'SUN' AND SEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the process of deriding, among other things, the prose style of Paul 
Rosenblatt's "The Sun in Capricorn" (Book Review, Jan. 21), Carolyn See, 
herself, writes the following gems: 
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, the Watermark Press operates out of Wichita, Kan., and not 
to denigrate Wichita in any way, but still, it's not the publishing capital of 
the United States." And: "The author readily acknowledges that the idea for 
this revolutionary came initially from a magazine piece written in 1970 by 
Sanche de Gramont, and, beyond that, the revolutionary is 'in name and being, 
work of the imagination.' " 
</P>
<P>
It seems probable that the book in question deserves the dissection it has 
received at the hand of Miss See, but surely a "dull scalpel" is a virtual 
oxymoron, even if a "clumsy surgeon," unfortunately, is not.

TRUNCATED TRAVAILS OF AN AMERICAN BOY; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMIES OF THE HEART BY CHRISTOPHER ZENOWICH (HARPER &amp; ROW: $16.95; 256 
PP.; 0-06-016243-0) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Eric Larsen, Larsen teaches at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New 
York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A volume of linked short stories about an American boy growing into early 
manhood might very well (as this one does) bring to mind that lean and 
influential prototype of the genre, Hemingway's "In Our Time." Of course, a 
vast sweep of history has passed since Hemingway's book appeared in 1925, and 
differences are to be expected, in fact required and wanted. One only wishes, 
by the end, that the differences here -- the deep ones -- might be somewhat 
less disheartening. 
</P>
<P>
Here, Christopher Zenowich takes up, story by story, the childhood and 
adolescence of one Bob Bodewicz (central character also of Zenowich's 1989 
novel, "The Cost of Living"). Bodewicz's introductions to life, as it happens, 
occur not in upper Michigan around the time of World War I, but in Connecticut, 
around Litchfield, starting in the 1950s and coming down toward the present. 
</P>
<P>
Like Nick Adams, Bodewicz has parents whom he simultaneously admires and feels 
oppressed by (Bob's father, uncouth in manner and quick with the hand in his 
child-rearing, is a factory worker); and, like Nick Adams, Bob Bodewicz is 
left, at the end of his own book of initiation tales, pondering the way he'll 
live the rest of his life, and the values he'll live it by. 
</P>
<P>
The big trouble is that one feels, by the end, that Bob has not so much grown 
in sensitivity or perception or resolve but rather that he is in fact gradually 
becoming limited and narrowed: That's the disheartening part, keeping this 
often talented and frequently charming book, too, from quickening fully into 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the early stories have about them an attentiveness to small and hidden 
moments in Bob's life that suggest an emerging singularity and compelling inner 
awareness of character -- in short, moments that make Bob interesting and 
complex. This isn't true in the broadly played conventionality of "Think Big" 
(Bob hopes to make lots of money by raising chinchillas in the basement), but 
in "Pete the Painter," details take hold that show the boy's private awareness 
of life, and of its mysterious power to cause suffering, starting to evolve. 
(Because he's interested in rocks, his parents arrange for him to be tutored in 
geology by a local inventor and retired high school science teacher -- who is 
himself stoically dying of a hideous and crippling disease.) 
</P>
<P>
The same suggestiveness is true, too, of "Earning Power," in which Bob earns 
spending money on a Sunday afternoon by sweeping out the deserted factory where 
his father works during the week. Making his way from the upper floors 
downward, the boy explores this old world of grimy commerce as he goes, and in 
the basement he comes upon rats, one of which, albino-eyed and blind, he 
manages to kill -- earning a moment of grudging but much-valued praise from his 
rough and hyper-critical father. 
</P>
<P>
Symbols continue to abound in the remaining stories as well, but less often 
does Bob's presence as an intuitively responding character grow in complexity 
or depth along with them. In fact it seems subtly to diminish. A family 
relative named Apley runs a successful farm, and the remainder of the book 
chronicles the string of calamitous events that bring about its decline. 
</P>
<P>
Working as a part-time farmhand (he's now in high school), Bob is witness to 
this gradual fall -- as, first, Apley's beautiful and ambitious daughter-in-law 
(she wanted to be a singer) is disfigured and left permanently retarded by a 
car wreck; as Apley's son Ted then falls into alcoholism and loses his will to 
take over the farm; as Trudy, Apley's scarcely-more-than-a-cipher wife, falls 
prey to the seductions of a cheap evangelist and runs off with him forever, 
taking along $30,000 from the farm's account. 
</P>
<P>
All of this Hardy-esque bad luck is conveyed believably enough, but another 
crucial and more subtle element, having to do with Bob's growth and awakening, 
tends to level out and weaken into standardisms as these gratuitous 
thunderbolts keep striking. In the closing line of a story called "Bats," in 
what one expects ought to be a quietly pivotal and revelatory moment, Bob 
thinks: "He knew now that which he had never known himself, that after all 
this, there would be questions -- why, why did this happen?" The odd 
circularity and peculiar obviousness of the line suggests what's disappeared -- 
that Bob in essence has stopped growing, stopped thinking, stopped being 
capable of a private or willed or passionate or principled change in response 
to the sordid and needful world he finds around him. 
</P>
<P>
Zenowich continues to put Bob, often skillfully, through stories whose events 
and symbols hint at that world of hazard and risk, but try as he might, he 
can't break successfully into an inner Bob, a Bob whose passions might somehow 
summon themselves up or change as a result. Bob spends long days picking stones 
out of a field ("Field Work"), spends whole nights waiting vainly to shoot 
raccoons who've been eating the corn ("Night Work") and almost -- 
heart-stoppingly -- falls while shingling a building ("On the Roof"). 
</P>
<P>
But by book's end, what does he want, and what will he do? What has the 
education of Bob Bodewicz come to? He'll go to college but find it vaguely a 
disappointment. And he'll imagine, in a small concluding flurry of platitudes, 
a life where "at the end . . . you came out with money. And love. And with the 
sense that every bad break had been made worthwhile." 
</P>
<P>
Out of this crucible has come, then -- what? Little more, it seems, than a wan 
and dreamy wistfulness, whether by author's intent or not. Closing the volume, 
one fears that there just wasn't, in truth, very much to Bob to start with.

REAGAN'S FALL FROM GRACE; 
</P>
<P>
THE $2-MILLION JAPAN TOUR, NANCY'S VENGEFUL MEMOIRS AND LEGAL BATTLES OVER THE 
IRAN-CONTRA AFFAIR HAVE MADE HIS RETIREMENT ANYTHING BUT RESTFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Martin Kasindorf, Martin Kasindorf is Los Angeles correspondent for Newsday. 
He has covered much of Ronald Reagan's political career. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THIS IS THE GOOD LIFE for Ronald Reagan on what he calls the mashed-potato 
circuit: On a weekday morning last month, shortly before his 79th birthday, the 
former President arrives at Las Vegas' Mirage hotel after a dash from Los 
Angeles on a corporate jet. America's 40th chief executive is the featured 
speaker at a Prudential realty-division sales convention. Reagan is accompanied 
by Secret Service agents and his equally protective young press secretary, Mark 
Weinberg. Mirage executives have relayed to Weinberg requests by the local news 
media to cover the speech. He has said no. 
</P>
<P>
At ease before hundreds of awe-struck real-estate agents, Reagan appears sturdy 
and strapping in a navy-blue suit. The audience murmurs, though, about how his 
hair has grown startlingly silver since he underwent surgery last September to 
remove fluid on the brain. These days, Reagan is laughing off the equestrian 
accident in Mexico that caused the skull problem by recounting a concerned 
admirer's advice to "never ride a borrowed horse." Restored to Great 
Communicator form, Reagan gives the standard speech he has crafted for business 
hosts. He argues -- so familiarly -- for a constitutional balanced-budget 
amendment and a presidential line-item veto, reforms he calls "the things we 
didn't get done." 
</P>
<P>
He fields questions with what some listeners consider charming but 
non-responsive anecdotes. Then he offers what he says is one memory of his 
historic encounters with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The junketeers 
perk up. This world-level inside stuff is more like it. During the 1988 Moscow 
summit, as Reagan relates the story with an actor's timing, the two leaders 
drove to a scenic waterfall. As the party stood above the cataract, Gorbachev 
asked one of Reagan's bodyguards if he would dive to the bottom. The agent 
demurred, explaining, "I've got a wife and three kids." Gorbachev made the same 
request of one of his own men, who complied at once. Appalled U.S. agents later 
asked the soaked Soviet why he had done it. "I've got a wife and three kids," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
What? The conventioneers glance at each other, then grasp the story's import. 
Free at last, Reagan is letting himself be Reagan. The tale is unreconstructed 
Evil Empire humor -- wistful for dated Cold War certitudes perhaps, but 
harmless Yakov Smirnoff material. On billows of laughs, the salespeople wave 
Reagan off to a fast lunch with a few top Prudential executives. He is motored 
back to the airport, where a staked-out TV news crew manages an extreme zoom 
shot of two ex-presidential legs disappearing into the private jet. 
</P>
<P>
In a bit more than two hours, Reagan has earned his private-sector speech price 
of $50,000 (no charge to charities or schools), less a commission of about 20% 
to his lecture agents, Washington Speakers Bureau Inc. At sunny resorts from 
Palm Springs to the Bahamas, where he spent his birthday Feb. 6 as a luncheon 
speaker for Sara Lee Corp., Reagan does "a couple or three a month" of these 
unpublicized Fortune 500 appearances, Weinberg says. Reagan is grossing as much 
as $1.8 million a year from this source alone. 
</P>
<P>
The charismatic role model for an era, Ronald Wilson Reagan made it not only 
acceptable but almost a moral imperative for Americans to go out and get their 
piece of the rock in the '80s. Now he is going out and getting his in the less 
freebooting '90s but encountering some severe buffeting to his popularity. 
</P>
<P>
Where Richard M. Nixon and Jimmy Carter began their retirement years in defeat 
and bitterness, painfully climbing back to a measure of approbation, Reagan and 
his wife, Nancy, returned to private life amid widespread good will that has 
been dissipating in periodic accusations of greed and selfishness. First, there 
was his $2-million speaking tour in Japan, followed by harsh reaction to 
Nancy's memoirs and to her desertion of a San Fernando Valley drug-treatment 
project. Then there were reports that the Internal Revenue Service was looking 
into Nancy's habit of "borrowing" designer dresses for White House functions. 
And, just when things seemed to be settling down, the embarrassing Iran-Contra 
mess reappeared as lawyers for the former President battled to restrict his 
participation in the trial of his former national security adviser, retired 
Rear Adm. John M. Poindexter. Only recently have the Reagans taken steps to 
burnish images dented by the surprisingly rocky start to their ex-First 
Couplehood. 
</P>
<P>
For the Great Communicator, whose standing plunged when he accepted the 
speaking honorarium from Japan's Fujisankei communications conglomerate last 
October, the main impression to be overcome is that he has been inappropriately 
cashing in on his eight-year presidency. 
</P>
<P>
DURING AN INTERVIEW in his 34th-floor Fox Plaza office above Avenue of the 
Stars, Reagan is asked to evaluate his busy new way of life. "Well," he says, 
"you just have to call it a change. It hardly can be called retirement." It was 
all he could do, Reagan says, to prevail upon aides recently to free his 
schedule for "a few days at the ranch" on horseback each month. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan circled Washington's monuments aboard Marine Corps One for the last time 
on Jan. 20, 1989. Only three weeks later, while a friend, Holmby Hills venture 
capitalist Charles Z. Wick, was negotiating the $2-million deal with 
Fujisankei, the fledgling former President was addressing Coca-Cola and 
McDonald's executives at conventions in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's embrace of business is entirely consistent with his role as a 
traveling spokesman for General Electric before he entered politics and with 
his Administration's free-market philosophy. Moreover, most of his schedule is 
devoted to more traditional ex-presidential pursuits: the memoirs, the library, 
raising money for his political party. He has been knighted by Queen Elizabeth 
II and inducted into the French Academy of Moral and Political Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
With all this, the man seems to be doing a marathon champion's job of 
carbo-loading on mashed potatoes. One February itinerary for the Reagans, like 
most of the former President's frequent trips, combined paid "private business 
group" events with freely disclosed charity or campus functions and Republican 
fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
The compensated stops are not what the average person would consider an 
economic necessity. Ronald and Nancy Reagan are collecting $131,623 in annual 
income from his pensions ($99,500 from the presidency, $32,123 from California) 
and at least $300,000 from other assets that were worth $4 million, at a 
minimum, before the tour of Japan. He receives handsome government-paid office 
space and $150,000 a year in federally funded staff assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy has made a few speeches at $30,000 apiece to non-charity groups, and the 
Reagans received a reported $7 million in publishers' advances on three books: 
her critically blasted but best-selling "My Turn"; his "Speaking My Mind," a 
compendium of ghosted White House speeches, and his forthcoming memoirs. Their 
New York literary agent, Morton Janklow, calls accounts of the advances 
"inaccurate," but the Reagans obviously feel financially secure. Recently, 
Reagan says, they bought the three-bedroom Bel-Air home they had been leasing 
for $15,000 a month from an investment group of rich confidants. Market value 
of the 1 1/4-acre St. Cloud Road property, Beverly Hills real estate agent 
Jeffrey Hyland calculates, is nearly $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
To support his enviable lifestyle, Reagan must endure a lot of travel that he 
doesn't particularly enjoy. "The job I was in," he says in his mangled syntax 
when unscripted, "travel began to be something I was saying, 'Enough, already.' 
" Even so, he finds satisfaction in the commercial moments of his latest and 
most undefined role. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't realize there were as many business seminars held around the country, 
convention-type things," he says as he toys with a fountain pen at his antique 
desk. "And it's amazing, the response. And some of them, a number of them, have 
played a trick on their own people, which has been a lot of fun for me. I get 
there and find that the group does not know I'm the speaker, and they're going 
to hear it when finally I am introduced. And, of course, it makes the 
reception, with all that surprise and everything, kind of exciting." 
</P>
<P>
As gratifying as this blissfully undemanding pastime is, Reagan has run into 
unwritten restrictions on how a former President can earn money, and he 
forthrightly acknowledges the issue. "I think there are things that you might 
easily give in to that would simply be a capitalizing on the job that you had, 
and I don't want to do that," he says. 
</P>
<P>
But Reagan was burned on Japan precisely because the visit, despite some bold 
warnings he gave the Japanese on their trade practices, was widely interpreted 
as the shameless huckstering of a President's prestige. "The thing with Japan 
-- that really pushed it over the edge," says the Reagans' 36-year-old novelist 
daughter, Patti Davis, who is estranged from her parents. The New York Times 
editorialized: "Former Presidents haven't always comported themselves with 
dignity after leaving the Oval Office. But none have plunged so blatantly into 
pure commercialism." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan had to sit there and grin when Donald Trump, of all people, made a crack 
about the Japanese millions from the podium at the Hebrew University Scopus 
Awards dinner at the Beverly Hilton in January. And an Oregon Democratic 
congressman, Peter DeFazio, alluded to the Japan trip when introducing a bill 
to eliminate an ex-President's pension for a year after any year in which he 
earns more than $400,000. "It's unseemly, to say the least, when a former 
President cashes in on his prestige this way, and doubly so when he continues 
to receive his full presidential pension," DeFazio said. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy, meanwhile, has been grappling with problems of her own. Currently 
granting few interviews, she is said by friends to be "down in the dumps" about 
the deluge of setbacks, especially the hostile reviews of "My Turn." The 
critics emphasized the combative, unintentionally revealing way Nancy recounted 
perceived slights, misunderstandings and malfeasances by everyone from her 
husband's fired chief of staff, Donald Regan, to Raisa Gorbachev (whose hair, 
Nancy meowed, "became less red over the years!"). 
</P>
<P>
As Sally Quinn wrote in the Washington Post, the book was "so hurtful, so 
painful, so embarrassing, so pathetic that it takes your breath away." A 
treasured old friend, CBS' Mike Wallace, left Nancy feeling shocked and 
betrayed after he relentlessly interrogated her for "60 Minutes." Literary 
agent Janklow wrote Wallace, "I wish you'd been that tough on (Libyan leader 
Moammar) Kadafi." 
</P>
<P>
Nancy also was skewered in the press for her abrupt abandonment of an 
ostensibly heartfelt plan to place the Nancy Reagan Center, a $10-million 
Phoenix House drug-treatment facility, in the San Fernando Valley's Lake View 
Terrace area. The moment a group of not-in-my-back-yard homeowners threatened 
to picket her leafy Bel-Air block, Nancy caved in, causing the respected 
Manhattan-based charity to forfeit $600,000 in option payments on the property. 
Some of Nancy's friends (according to Phoenix House, they were Merv Griffin, 
Hollywood Park race track owner Marge Everett and businessman Leonard Straus) 
asked the organization to return their $270,000 in donations. Nancy, 
exasperated and wounded by the backlash, counterattacked after a lengthy 
silence by telling columnist Liz Smith last month that she had "worked hard to 
convince them not to do this." 
</P>
<P>
On the advice of lawyers, Phoenix House is keeping the gifts and seeking a 
smaller building elsewhere. "People have been very sympathetic," a Phoenix 
House officer says. "If nothing else, the incident has brought attention to the 
issue of drug treatment. In certain ways, it has been cause for optimism." 
</P>
<P>
Nancy is also suffering through an IRS investigation into the taxability of her 
"borrowing" of designer couture during the White House years. Astrologer Joan 
Quigley contradicts Nancy's "My Turn" recollections in a book to be published 
in April. And an unauthorized biography by author Kitty Kelley -- expected to 
be a claw job -- rounds out the former First Lady's list of woes. 
</P>
<P>
While in the White House, Nancy's overriding concern was how history would 
regard her husband's presidency. It is her most substantive worry these days 
that a favorable long-term appraisal of the Reagan years is far from secure. 
His generally well-received presidency is experiencing a troubled afterlife, 
disinterred by astoundingly fast-working revisionists appearing from every 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Underscoring the invidious equation implied in President George Bush's 
description of his own approach as "kinder and gentler," Bush's aides have 
drawn sly, not-for-attribution comparisons between their man's hard-working 
habits and Reagan's banker's hours. Peggy Noonan, an all-but-worshiping White 
House speech writer for Reagan, invented "kinder and gentler" for Bush and 
declares in her new book, "What I Saw at the Revolution," that the battle for 
the mind of Reagan was fought over "barren terrain." Other books try to paint 
the Reagan '80s as having been typified by criminal Wall Street greed. Writer 
Paul Slansky, characterized by Newsweek as a "career Gippophobe," seeks to 
scratch away the final millimeters of Teflon with a low-flying collection of 
Reagan howlers titled "The Clothes Have No Emperor." Friends say Reagan gets 
more upset by Nancy's bad press than his own, but even her difficulties are no 
match for his celebrated optimism. "Like anything, of course, sometimes you run 
into little bumps that you hadn't counted on," he allows brightly, "but that 
goes with everyday life, I think, for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
Not much gets him down, not even his admittedly expensive court battle to 
minimize his role in the Poindexter trial. "I can understand it," he says of 
the hefty bills he's been paying lawyers. Poindexter, charged with conspiracy 
and obstructing Congress, argues that Reagan authorized all his actions. Yet 
Reagan's attorneys fought for months to keep their client clear of the 
proceedings, finally agreeing in the face of compelling legal precedents that 
he would give videotaped testimony in a Los Angeles courtroom. The judge in 
Poindexter's impending trial, which will be held in Washington, can review the 
tape to excise any inadvertent breaches of national security. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Reagan has stuck to a Nixonian claim of executive privilege 
when asked to provide some of his diary entries to Poindexter. There could be 
years of appeals over Reagan's position in this land mine of a case, prolonging 
the unfavorable impression of Reagan as a man of one-way loyalty when his most 
self-sacrificing defenders need his aid. Retired Maj. Gen. Richard Secord 
sniped in January after his own Iran-Contra sentencing to two years' probation: 
"Former President Reagan has been hiding out. I think it's cowardly." 
</P>
<P>
DEMONSTRABLY, REAGAN recognizes that he has a serious problem of public 
perception. Even before the Japan tour, a Times Mirror survey last August rated 
Reagan "highly believable" by only 16% of Americans, just above talk-show host 
Geraldo Rivera at the bottom of a list of 16 public figures and news 
organizations. To prevent further erosion of his image, he has enlisted a 
volunteer corps of prominent public-relations executives, including Robert K. 
Gray in Washington and Harold Burson, of Burson-Marsteller Inc., in New York. 
From Irvine, Stuart Spencer, an old campaign hand, advises Reagan on which 
politicians' fund-raising invitations to accept or avoid. 
</P>
<P>
The still-resonating Fujisankei disaster notwithstanding, friend Charles Wick 
doesn't stint on his advice when he sees the Reagans socially, "up to two or 
three times a week," he says. After all, Reagan put Wick in charge of America's 
international image for eight years at the U.S. Information Agency. As Gray 
tells it, "Charlie Wick is the No. 1 adviser to him, and has been for a long 
time. He gives advice not only when he's asked, but sometimes when he isn't 
asked." 
</P>
<P>
What sort of issues does Reagan bounce off this loyalist guard? "Oh, lordy," 
Reagan muses in the Rectangular Office, gazing toward the ocean shimmering a 
few miles from his windows. "Well . . . if you were making a journey, and so 
forth, you might, because we were all involved in the relations with another 
country, you might feel them out on what their view is in addition to your own. 
. . . If I did this or accepted that invitation or something, would that appear 
to you as cashing in or capitalizing on it, or something of that kind? And 
they've all got darn good taste." 
</P>
<P>
The gurus won't reveal their advice, but no more high-profile foreign speaking 
trips are in the works. Management of the Reagan image has tightened 
considerably, with former White House deputy press secretary Weinberg as the 
well-wired lead defender. When a journalist called Revlon Group Inc. about 
Nancy's membership on its board of directors, Weinberg responded, demanding, 
"Why were you calling Revlon?" Robert Lindsey, a Carmel journalist and author 
("The Falcon and the Snowman") collaborating with Reagan on the still-untitled 
memoirs, is contractually sworn to silence. The lecture agency bucks media 
questions to Weinberg. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Reagan's charitable activities have become much more visible. United 
Way's local chapter received a $10,000 gift from the former First Couple. 
Reagan asked Disneyland to pay his $50,000 fee for an appearance at the 
amusement park's 35th anniversary celebration, then surprised many who had 
considered his Administration stingy toward AIDS research by donating the money 
to the Pediatric AIDS Foundation in Santa Monica. "I hope he doesn't go 
overboard," Gray says about such giveaways. "It's important to keep his clout 
from the money he's able to draw." 
</P>
<P>
WHEN REAGAN IS IN Los Angeles, a Secret Service sedan tailed by a gun-toting 
station wagon drops him at Fox Plaza at 10 a.m. Perhaps the city's glitziest 
tower, the skyscraper where Bruce Willis vanquished terrorists in the movie 
"Die Hard" shrieks of the push for money and power from every pink marble 
neo-Moderne angle. The lobby directory is heavy with entertainment lawyers, 
industrialists such as Marvin Davis and Alfred Checchi, Australian and British 
broadcasting companies. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's rooms and those of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library Foundation, 
the Nancy Reagan Foundation and the Secret Service detail (Reagan calls them 
"S.S. agents") take up the heavily secured top floor. The ex-presidential 
suite, studded with bronze eagles and sagebrush canvases, could belong to the 
president of a major university except for the photos of Reagan with world 
leaders. The 20 or so faces in the suite, from the rangy chief of staff, Fred 
Ryan, to the greenest intern, are predominantly youthful and as 
conservative-looking as an "Up With People!" chorus. 
</P>
<P>
When he arrives, Reagan finds on his desk a copy of the presidential news 
summary faxed from the White House. First off, he confers with Ryan, Weinberg 
and Kathy Osborne, his executive assistant, on the day's agenda. Then the 
parade of visitors begins. They have included Vice President Dan Quayle, Mother 
Teresa, Brian Mulroney of Canada and other visiting prime ministers. 
Journalists are asked to provide a list of questions for Reagan in advance. 
</P>
<P>
In a conference room dominated by the breathtaking view, Reagan videotapes a 
testimonial, say, for a Billy Graham tribute. No longer supplied a Peggy 
Noonan, he inks his own brief comments for an American Ireland Fund dinner ("as 
Henry the Eighth said to each of his six wives, 'I won't keep you long' "), or 
answers a letter that appeals to him. 
</P>
<P>
Every few weeks, Lindsey flies in from Carmel. Reagan dictates thoughts for the 
memoirs then; at other times, he jots them down on yellow legal pads at home. 
Reagan hints that -- with a few nods to the early years he recorded in the 1965 
"Where's the Rest of Me?" -- his memoirs will be a milder "My Turn," 
emphasizing his explanations of controversial White House decisions. The Simon 
&amp; Schuster book, Janklow says, could appear as early as this fall. But 
Reagan will be no Nixon: Like Nancy, he has no plans for other books. 
</P>
<P>
Edmund Morris, winner of a Pulitzer Prize for his biography of Theodore 
Roosevelt, traveled from Washington recently to ask some of his final questions 
for the Random House historical biography of Reagan that he expects to deliver 
early in 1991, after six years of generous access to his subject. "He's the 
most cooperative man in the world," Morris says of the former President, who is 
receiving no money for the book. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan is briefed every two weeks on the progress of his library, which is 
expected to open soon after his 80th birthday next year. Driven from Stanford 
University by faculty and student opposition, the $43-million-plus project is 
under construction at a Simi Valley hilltop site donated by developers who own 
adjoining acreage. The location, one scarcely associated with Reagan, is at 
least convenient, "between the ranch and his Bel-Air home," rationalizes 
Charles Jelloian, the library foundation's operations director. The 
Mission-style building will contain a museum "centered on the '80s," Jelloian 
says, as well as presidential papers and research rooms. For now, the tons of 
documents are stuffed into a Culver City warehouse under National Archives 
control. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation trustees are headed by two former attorneys general, William 
French Smith as chairman and Edwin Meese III as the forgiving vice chairman. 
(Nancy bashed Meese in "My Turn.") The trustees will turn the completed library 
over to the government but will operate a conference center there. In keeping 
with the self-conscious policy of withholding the names of corporations paying 
Reagan to speak, something any cub reporter can discover after a few phone 
calls, the foundation more successfully guards its list of contributors. 
</P>
<P>
The former First Lady has her own impeccable office at the Nancy Reagan 
Foundation, where she works on the anti-drug fight a few days a month. Her 
foundation, its blue-chip board chaired by former CIA director Richard Helms, 
raises $500,000 a year, mainly through a celebrity tennis tournament. It has 
distributed grants to drug education and treatment programs helping primarily 
minority youngsters in Southern California. The foundation schedules her 
appearances at schools, where she is still urging children to "just say no." 
</P>
<P>
Around 3 p.m., Reagan is driven the 10-minute route home. He is as bemused as 
any other Southern Californian by how the region has changed. "I do not recall 
ever seeing the traffic situation the way it is," he says, shaking his head. At 
the house, a refurbished, older ranch-style that daughter Patti disdains as "so 
sort of perfect, with all those little art pieces and figurines," Reagan can 
lift weights in his gym or swim in the heated pool. Most evenings, he and Nancy 
watch old movies together on television -- just Ronnie and Mommy and the Secret 
Service. Their socializing runs "in spurts," Wick says. Dinners out are most 
often at old favorites, Chasen's or the Bistro. Reagan gives no indication of 
discovering new pleasures in retirement. He goes along with the routine of 
office work and travel, broken by chain-sawing firewood and riding at the Santa 
Barbara-area ranch. 
</P>
<P>
For all the sentiment conveyed by about two dozen chrome-framed family 
photographs behind Reagan's office desk, the blended family of his two 
marriages is not much closer-knit than it ever was. For example, when Nancy 
moved back from Washington, she publicly voiced a desire to reconcile with 
Patti. That hasn't happened, and it's no wonder. There were two or three 
"brief, cordial meetings" at the Bel-Air house in the first months, says Davis, 
who recently separated from her husband, yoga instructor Paul Grilley. Then 
came "My Turn," in which Nancy avenged herself for every one of Patti's 
babyhood tantrums. "I haven't spoken to her since the book came out," Patti 
says. "She messengered it to me for my birthday, which I thought was, uh, an 
interesting birthday present." 
</P>
<P>
NO LONGER WHOLESALING the presidency through glaringly large honorariums, 
Reagan is continuing to cash in on a more discreet $50,000 retail level, some 
might say. Scrutinized as any ex-President is, fairly or not, why would someone 
of Reagan's ample resources risk his popularity to do it? 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Reagan believes he has the right, indeed the duty, to be a 
breadwinner. "I think unless someone's got inherited wealth, they should be 
willing to earn a living outside," he says. In fact, Reagan remains as 
stubbornly unrepentant about Fujisankei as he is about Iran-Contra. "I just 
thought that in 16 years I hadn't made any kind of money," he candidly told the 
Hollywood Radio and Television Society last November. He apologized only for 
remarks he made in Japan welcoming Japanese takeovers of Hollywood studios as a 
means of restoring decency to American films. 
</P>
<P>
In a January cable appearance on "Larry King Live!" Reagan defended the big 
honorarium by citing an American actor who reportedly received $3 million for a 
Japanese commercial. King passed up the opportunity to make the obvious point 
that Reagan cannot intuit: The unidentified actor he mentioned was not a former 
President of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the reasoning that others do it, Reagan cites a resulting new charitable 
capacity "to help more than I have." Illinois' tiny Eureka College is one 
beneficiary of his growing concern with giving. "My little alma mater has 
always lived in genteel poverty," he says. "And to anticipate the ability to 
send a meaningful check there occasionally that helps them in their problems . 
. . you can do some good with money, and I believe in doing that." Officials at 
Eureka confirm that Reagan has been a generous Class of '32 alumnus. 
</P>
<P>
Another rationale for turning Reagan's twilight years into his peak earning 
years involves the unexpected drains on an ex-President's checkbook in this 
litigious, second-guessing era. The plague of Poindexter legal bills represents 
one argument for building a healthy reserve. "These are decent, honest people," 
Wick says, "and they came back to a life where financial need, the need to earn 
money, was a matter of consequence to them." 
</P>
<P>
Others might attribute to the couple less conscious motivations for maximizing 
their assets. The Reagans were long the poorest of their social set, their cash 
believed to be a pittance compared with that of socialite Betsy Bloomingdale or 
steel magnate Earle Jorgensen. After decades of relative sacrifice in politics, 
the Reagans don't have much time to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been important for a Republican President to make money on a par with his 
wealthy friends," says Erwin Hargrove, a Vanderbilt University political 
scientist and author of a 1988 study of Carter's presidency. "That's been true 
for Ike, Ford and now Reagan. They not only feel inferior to the businessmen 
they socialize with, they admire these guys." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever Reagan's reasons, Duke University presidential scholar James David 
Barber takes a purist's view of the potato-mashing: "He's using public service 
for making bucks. The role of an ex-President is to be a hero for the youth of 
the nation, to bring out the duty that every citizen has to serve the nation. 
Has he no sense of having been benefited? Having the power of the country means 
you have to do something for the country later on." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan, however, is not unique among America's former presidents in doing well 
while often doing good. Hargrove has little trouble scanning recent history for 
rough analogies to Reagan's postprandial entertainment of corporate America: 
Lyndon Johnson's "frenetic" hands-on operation of his Texas broadcasting 
properties in retirement, John F. Kennedy's idea of buying the New York Herald 
Tribune after leaving the Oval Office. To pose the question of what amounts to 
"cashing in" is to confront the issue of whether America has the right to make 
any demand of the nation's former commanders-in-chief. Opinions run the gamut 
from laissez-faire to flinty puritanism. 
</P>
<P>
"To put it in Hollywood terms, we make our Presidents contract players," argues 
Robert Gray. "When the contract is up, their lives should be their own." George 
Bush, queried about Reagan's fee-for-service practices, diplomatically breezed, 
"Everybody's got the right to make a living." Barber contends that former 
Presidents should forswear all commercial advantage from public service. "It's 
wrong," he says. 
</P>
<P>
On ABC's "Nightline" during the height of the furor over Fujisankei, Gray 
proposed ending the debate by officially defining the role of an ex-President. 
One suggestion involves a "public elder statesman" Senate seat based on the 
example of John Quincy Adams, who served 19 years in the House of 
Representatives after his Administration ended in 1829. "Naive," Hargrove 
scoffs. "They've had their time in the sun. To call them a 'national resource' 
is quite mistaken." 
</P>
<P>
As Hargrove interprets the wavy line America has drawn, "it adds up to 
Presidents being able to do whatever they want, within certain bounds of 
decency and taste." These bounds, he declares, "Reagan probably overstepped. 
The values of the private sector permeated the Reagan Administration and got 
them into trouble. A guy like Ed Meese couldn't tell the difference. I think 
Reagan certainly reflects that." 
</P>
<P>
In truth, none of Reagan's living counterparts would satisfy an ascetic's 
conception of an ex-President. Carter hammers nails into inner-city Habitat for 
Humanity housing and mediates civil wars in the Horn of Africa but says he 
doesn't mean to set himself up as a model for the others. Besides, he, too, 
accepts one or two lecture payments a month, without a fixed price or an agent. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon, even with his obsessive political schmoozing behind the scenes, may come 
closest to the modern pattern that was established and all but sanctified by 
Harry S Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower: Make an acceptable killing on your 
memoirs, provide world-affairs advice when asked and stay out of the 
marketplace. Nixon steers clear of big business and declines pay for his few 
speeches. Still, he has amassed appreciable wealth from San Clemente and 
Manhattan real-estate dealings as well as from his conveyor-belt output of 
books on public policy. 
</P>
<P>
It was Gerald R. Ford who paved the path for Reagan in breaking the modern 
taboo against joining the business world. By 1987, Ford was on eight corporate 
boards of directors. At 76, "he's trying to retire," says Penny Circle, Ford's 
chief of staff, but he is still a director of American Express and its Shearson 
Lehman Hutton and IDS Financial Services subsidiaries, as well as Tesoro 
Petroleum, Texas Commerce Bancshares, Nova Pharmaceuticals, Primerica and 
Spectradyne. Ford continues to make one or two paid speeches every month, but 
compared with Reagan, he's a bargain at $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
Both Ford and Carter accepted business-paid trips to Japan before Reagan did. 
Kansai Television has imported Ford twice, Carter once. The YKK Co., which 
operates a zipper factory in Georgia, has hosted several other Carter visits to 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Ford, Reagan has not accepted directorships. Nancy has. At the urging of 
Revlon chairman Ronald O. Perelman, who barely knew her, she joined the board 
last June. The privately held company will not disclose her compensation. 
Similar-sized public firms are paying outside directors $17,500 to $20,000 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan says he stands ready for public missions in the Herbert Hoover 
tradition, but he has formed no overarching conception of what continuing value 
he can provide, in the way Carter has regained luster by focusing on 
international conflict resolution. "Well," Reagan ventures, "I'll do whatever 
can be helpful to the present President in that regard." 
</P>
<P>
Is he in the Bush loop? "It depends on what's going on," he says. "Sometimes he 
gives me a ring; sometimes I think of something and call him. We exchange notes 
every once in a while." Reagan has been back to the White House once, for the 
unveiling of his official portrait. He has a standing invitation from Gorbachev 
to visit the Soviet Union and still corresponds with the Soviet leader. 
</P>
<P>
The "gilded cage" of White House living, as Reagan calls it, wore on him. He 
expresses no nostalgia for the crises and policy disputes. Among his relatively 
few known suggestions on international subjects in recent months was an idea 
for a Berlin Olympics in 2000 or 2004, a proposal adopted by East and West 
German officials, Bush and Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
What Reagan misses is the woodsy getaways at Camp David. "You can walk out the 
front door or the back door if you want," he says mistily, "and there are 
myriad things to do. You can take a hike there, and it's all right. As I say, 
it's a normal home, and, thanks to Dwight Eisenhower, in your back yard now 
you've got a putting green and sort of a pitch-and-putt situation where you can 
practice a little golf swinging, and there's a pool. . . . The Park Police 
would bring up horses, and we'd ride." 
</P>
<P>
HAROLD BURSON says, "President Reagan came out on such a high as a President 
that people are expecting him to live up to an even higher standard. I think he 
recognizes that." It wouldn't take much for Reagan to revive the good feeling 
engendered by his legendary charm, but if he is to regain his sure-footedness, 
he must go beyond public-relations damage control. At a minimum, an end to the 
secretiveness about his paid speakings and the library donors would forestall 
suspicion and cynicism. 
</P>
<P>
"He eventually will look as good as he is," Gray predicts. "His natural 
instincts are good. And his heart is in the right place." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's heart could provide one key to attaining the peace of mind millions of 
admirers have wished for the couple. He may prove himself most happily educable 
in fronting for charities with difficult messages to communicate, thereby 
becoming a social resource on a par with Carter's high-minded example -- a 
veritable point of light. He has made a start with help that has overwhelmed 
Elizabeth Glaser, who with her husband, Paul Michael Glaser, the co-star of 
TV's "Starsky and Hutch," was among the founders of the Pediatric AIDS 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
While still in the White House, Reagan invited Elizabeth Glaser for a long 
chat, touched by her plight. She contracted the HIV virus during pregnancy 
through a blood transfusion, which resulted in the death of the couple's 
daughter from AIDS at age 6 and HIV-positive readings for their 5-year-old son. 
Not much came of the talk, but Reagan has become more involved in recent 
months, even to the extent of hauling Christmas gifts to AIDS-stricken children 
at UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Like many other activists, Glaser thought Reagan's Administration was late and 
grudging when it came to AIDS. "There are people who feel very angry at him," 
she says, "but we feel very grateful that he is now happy to help. As the Great 
Communicator, he has an open line to a large section of the country that 
possibly no one else can reach." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan spent a few months pondering his proper role, then offered to tape a 
public-service spot aimed at the ignorance that often makes HIV-positive 
children pariahs. Many television viewers have seen the Chiat / Day / Mojo spot 
by now. 
</P>
<P>
Looking earnestly into the camera at the Hotel Bel-Air, Reagan says this: "We 
all grow and learn in our lives, and I've learned that all kinds of people can 
get AIDS, even children. But it's the disease that's frightening, not the 
people who have it. You know, you can't catch AIDS from hugging someone. I'm 
not asking you for your money. I'm asking you for something even more important 
-- your understanding. Maybe it's time we all learned something new."

THE BOOK TRADE: CRITICS' AWARDS: NUTS AND BOLTS, AND HOLD THE GLITZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH MEHREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At least the scroll now comes in a frame. 
</P>
<P>
For the first five years of the National Book Critics' Circle's existence, that 
is to say, winners of the group's annual awards took home not a chunky check or 
a sculpture by a renowned artist, but a rolled-up scroll lauding the author's 
contribution to the field of American letters. 
</P>
<P>
It was not that the NBCC had some lofty purpose in mind, said one of the 
organization's founders, free-lance critic Eliot Fremont-Smith; simply that "we 
didn't have any money." 
</P>
<P>
As it happened, added Fremont-Smith, now the NBCC's treasurer, "the fact that 
there is no money involved seems to have enhanced the awards. Maybe you could 
call it reverse snobbism." 
</P>
<P>
But NBCC president and chairman Nina King, Book World editor of the Washington 
Post, said, "I don't think there's anything impure about giving money. I think 
the reason we have not given money is that traditionally we have not wanted to 
accept money from outside sources," such as publishing houses. 
</P>
<P>
The National Book Awards, for example, takes in substantial revenue from its 
glitzy, $400-per-person annual awards dinner, an event that is heavily 
supported by the publishing industry. By contrast, the board of the NBCC, with 
its dues of $30 per year, once came close to taking up a collection among 
members to pay for its decidedly unglitzy annual cocktail party. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting, in the manner of literati of generations past, at the staid old 
Algonquin Hotel, the NBCC was conceived in the spring of 1974 during one of the 
periodic identity crises of the National Book Awards (which later became the 
American Book Awards, and still later became once again the National Book 
Awards). 
</P>
<P>
Although the group intended to pay recognition to the writers of America, the 
NBCC also grew up in what Nona Balakian, an editor on the New York Times Book 
Review who was the NBCC's first secretary-treasurer, called "the high hope and 
expectation of lifting from growing obscurity and neglect the hard-working book 
critics of this nation." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, said King, the NBCC has been successful. Recognizing the 
contribution of the sometimes lowly literary critic was "the whole point," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the basic clue to the National Book Critics' Circle is that it is a 
very ad hoc organization," said Brigitte Weeks, the editor-in-chief of the 
Book-of-the-Month Club, Inc., who served as president of the NBCC when she was 
editor of the Washington Post's Book World. 
</P>
<P>
"In the best sense," Fremont-Smith agreed, "it is still an amateur 
organization." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sort of tangled gathering of a bunch of people who write about books," 
Weeks said. "Some of them have lots of clout and lots of power, and some of 
them are free-lancers, people who are not well-known at all. And they're all 
meeting together, literally in a smoke-filled room." 
</P>
<P>
That room is no longer in the Algonquin, because when the hotel was sold to a 
Japanese concern, the NBCC lost its freebie quarters. But the rabble-rousing 
quality of a 24-person board has persisted -- as has the decidedly nonregional 
character of the NBCC as a whole. Debates over award selections or over issues 
of ethics are likely to be heated and passionate, board members said. These 
fierce but friendly arguments and discussions are equally apt to represent 
voices from far beyond the traditional publishing purview of Gotham. 
</P>
<P>
"There used to be a lot of paranoia about the regional issue; do we have enough 
people from outside New York," Fremont-Smith said. But now, former president 
Weeks said, the NBCC is "not at all Manhattan-dominated. If anything, it's 
almost the other way." 
</P>
<P>
"There is a certain provincialism in the East," Fremont-Smith said. But, he 
added, "at least up until now the fact is that the center of publishing has 
been New York City, period. So the pining and the whining about regionalism has 
a lot to do with that fact." 
</P>
<P>
NBCC awards are selected according to what is known as a "two-tier" basis where 
the general membership is involved in voting on a limited number of nominees. 
If, in a mail ballot, 20% of those voting choose a particular title, it is 
automatically nominated. 
</P>
<P>
With as many as three of the five nominations in each category done by the 
membership, board members then discuss the remaining selections and engage in 
straw votes. "But nothing is decided until the very end, which is a 
ratification vote to show that everyone has done his or her best," 
Fremont-Smith said. In that phase of the selection process, there is no time 
limit to discussion, and decisions must be unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
Often, of course, the titles chosen by the NBCC are the same as those selected 
by the Pulitzer Prize Committee or by the National Book Awards. In part, Nina 
King said, this is because "the books that do get nominated tend to be the big, 
noticeable, recognizable books" -- and they may also be the country's best 
books for that year and that category. "It's my gut feeling that there are not 
that many unrecognized gems," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, this very harmony that emerges from the voting and selection 
process almost seems to be in contradiction with an organization made up of 
people who make their livings by expressing divergent opinions. Critics are by 
nature an independent, sometimes cantankerous lot. Putting them in a room, or 
on a single ballot, together and asking them to reach a consensus almost seems 
to argue with the very notion of autonomy that critics hold so dear. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the continued survival of the NBCC does seem to indicate 
that there is room for both individual opinions and a collective view. And 
critics who may feel compromised by a mass statement are not, after all, 
required to join or to participate. 
</P>
<P>
Weeks, for one, says she misses her involvement in the organization she was 
forced to quit when she stepped from journalism into the business side of 
publishing. After all, it was she who sat up late one night, slipping those 
scrolls into clip-in frames. 
</P>
<P>
The NBCC, she said, "is very nuts and bolts." 
</P>
<P>
ALSO: A study from the U.S. Department of Commerce ranks the New York, Los 
Angeles, Boston, Chicago and Washington, D.C., metropolitan areas as the 
country's top book markets. But the same report showed that the communities 
with the highest bookstore sales per household were Austin, Tex.; Madison, 
Wis.; San Jose, Calif.; Boston, and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
In other statistical developments, a survey released by the American 
Booksellers Assn. showed that 72 million Americans, or 39% of the adult 
population, gave and/or received a book during the 1989 holiday season. Baby 
boomers showed a definite preference for books, with 48% of adults ages 35 to 
44 reporting that they gave or received a book. Forty-six percent of 
Republicans and 43% of Independents exchanged books, while only 33% of 
Democrats did so. 
</P>
<P>
. . . In West Germany, one of the popular ways to buy books is through the 280 
book-club centers that serve as supplemental distribution channels for books 
from all publishers. In East Germany, barely had the Wall come down but 
Bertelsmann had opened its first book-club center. As in the west, customers 
wishing to buy books there must first become members. Calling the new facility 
a test of the East German market, Bertelsmann said the Dresden location would 
sell only books. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the international front, Aryeh Neier, executive director of Human 
Rights Watch, and John G. Ryden, director of Yale University Press, have 
announced a joint publishing program designed to promote worldwide 
dissemination of Human Rights Watch reports. 
</P>
<P>
"Reliable, documented reports on human-rights abuses have become the most 
important means of reducing those abuses," Neier Said, "because in today's 
world, almost every government cares about its international reputation and is 
aware that responsible publications of its abuses damage that reputation." 
</P>
<P>
The new venture will include publication of select Human Rights Watch reports; 
publication of an annual "state of the world" volume; publication under a joint 
imprint of original books on human rights topics, and transfer of the entire 
Human Rights Watch backlist to a data base to make them more readily 
accessible. 
</P>
<P>

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: BORROWED TIME: AN AIDS MEMOIR BY PAUL MONETTE (AVON: $8.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In this often moving chronicle, Paul Monette describes the 19-month battle his 
lover, Roger Horwitz, waged against AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
A deeply felt account of love and sorrow, "Borrowed Time" recounts how the two 
men strove to preserve the life they shared, despite Horwitz's inevitable 
decline. The luxuriousness of that life often undercuts the story: Monette and 
Horwitz had wealth and connections that enabled them to obtain comforts and 
experimental treatments not available to other patients. Despite this flaw, 
Monette has written a dignified yet angry testimony to the suffering wrought by 
AIDS. "Borrowed Time" is one of the first personal accounts of the sorrows of 
the pandemic; unhappily, many more undoubtedly will follow.

Five short tales, only two of which previously have been translated into 
English. 
</P>
<P>
Warm, gentle and funny, "The Magic Whistle," "Peter and His Goose" and "The 
King of the Moles and His Daughter" recall the stories of Hans Christian 
Andersen rather than "The Three Musketeers." As "The Night of the Lepus" 
demonstrated, rabbits are not generally perceived as frightening animals, yet 
Dumas manages to make the snowy phantom in the title story a truly baleful 
apparition. "The Adventures of Seven Stars on Earth," a jolly fable of 
Jupiter's unsuccessful efforts to bring happiness to an ungrateful humanity, 
evokes the rollicking tone of Dumas' popular adventure novels.

ENDPAPERS: THE COUNTERCULTURAL WINNIE-THE-POOH

<P>
Though the characters in "Winnie-the-Pooh" were drawn from A. A. Milne's own 
life and that of his son, they are also figures that might appear in any 
childhood. Who has not had a cheerfully reckless friend like Tigger, or a wryly 
gloomy one like Eeyore? Even more to the point, what child -- or adult -- has 
not had days when he or she felt like Tigger or like Eeyore, or as small and 
nervous as Piglet? 
</P>
<P>
It was Milne's genius to have created, working from such apparently simple 
materials, these universal types, and to have constructed in a few acres of 
English countryside a world that has the qualities both of the Golden Age of 
history and legend, and the lost paradise of childhood -- two eras that, 
according to psychologists, are often one in the unconscious mind. 
</P>
<P>
Among the characters seen from a child's viewpoint, Pooh is the child himself. 
The rest have virtues and faults particular to some adults and some children; 
Pooh, the hero, has the virtues and faults common to all children. He is 
simple, natural and affectionate. But he also is a Bear of Very Little Brain, 
continually falling into ludicrous errors of judgment and comprehension -- he 
is so greedy that he eats Eeyore's birthday jar of honey on his way to deliver 
it. Yet these faults are also endearing; all of us at birth were stupid and 
greedy, but no less lovable for that. As Milne himself has remarked, children 
combine natural innocence and grace with a "brutal egotism." 
</P>
<P>
" 'Oh, Bear!' said Christopher Robin. 'How I do love you!' 
</P>
<P>
" 'So do I,' said Pooh." 
</P>
<P>
But slow though he is, Pooh always comes through in an emergency. When Roo 
falls into the river, everyone behaves in a typical way: 
</P>
<P>
" 'Look at me swimming,' squeaked Roo from the middle of his pool, and was 
hurried down a waterfall into the next pool. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was doing something to help. Piglet . . . was jumping up and down 
and making 'Oo, I say' noises; Owl was explaining that in a case of Sudden and 
Temporary Immersion the Important Thing was to keep the Head Above Water; Kanga 
was jumping along the bank, saying 'Are you sure you're all right, Roo dear?' . 
. . Eeyore had turned round and hung his tail over the first pool into which 
Roo fell, and with his back to the accident was grumbling quietly to himself. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
" 'Get something across the stream lower down, some of you fellows,' called 
Rabbit." 
</P>
<P>
But it is Pooh who rescues Roo just as he later rescues Piglet; it is Pooh who 
discovers the "North Pole." 
</P>
<P>
If Pooh is the child as hero, Christopher Robin is the child as God. He is also 
the ideal parent. He is both creator and judge -- the two divine functions 
shared by mortal parents. He does not participate in most of the adventures but 
usually appears at the end of the chapter, sometimes descending with a machine 
(an umbrella, a popgun, et cetera) to save the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Milne's ironic view of the adult world and its pretensions is sometimes 
undercut by another sort of irony addressed to adults who might be reading the 
book aloud. These passages, which appear mostly at the beginning of 
"Winnie-the-Pooh" (there are none in the sequel), take the form of 
condescending conversations between the author and Christopher Robin. 
</P>
<P>
"'Was that me?' said Christopher Robin in an awed voice, hardly daring to 
believe it. 
</P>
<P>
" 'That was you.' 
</P>
<P>
"Christopher Robin said nothing, but his eyes got larger and larger, and his 
face got pinker and pinker." Behind the godlike child is another and more 
powerful deity: A. A. Milne, who has created both Christopher Robin and Pooh. 
</P>
<P>
There are other partly concealed messages from the author to the adult or 
adolescent reader. The verbal hypocrisies of greed are mocked in Tigger, those 
of cowardice in Piglet, and those of polite etiquette in Rabbit. A similar 
criticism may lie behind the frequent attempts of the characters to elaborate 
some error or misunderstanding into a system, as with Pooh and Piglet's hunt 
for the Woozle. As soon as a real fact or observation is introduced, the system 
collapses, and the Woozle vanishes. 
</P>
<P>
Milne's language, too, contains hidden messages. He pretends not to understand 
long words and makes fun of people who use them. He employs a special form of 
punctuation, capitalizing words usually written with a lower-case letter, as is 
done now only in theatrical and film publicity. 
</P>
<P>
But in the Pooh books the effect is reversed: Milne capitalizes to show that 
though the character takes something seriously, the reader need not do so. When 
Pooh remarks "I have been Foolish and Deluded," the words are weakened by the 
capital letters; to have said that Pooh was foolish and deluded would have been 
much stronger. 
</P>
<P>
A subversive side effect of this procedure is to weaken words that are 
conventionally capitalized and, by extension, the things they stand for. Milne 
was aware of this; in an essay on his poem, "The King's Breakfast," he makes a 
suggestion for reading the lines: 
</P>
<P>
 The King asked 
</P>
<P>
 The Queen and 
</P>
<P>
 The Queen asked 
</P>
<P>
 The Dairymaid: 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't be afraid of saying 'and' at the end of the second line; the second and 
third words have the same value, and you need not be alarmed because one is a 
royal noun and the other is only a common conjunction." 
</P>
<P>
When Milne uses a word, it means what he tells it to mean; his Bears and 
Expeditions are of a very special kind. He makes the rules; he determines what 
things and emotions will be allowed into his books and on what terms. 
</P>
<P>
In the same way, when Milne came to write his "Autobiography" he tended to 
remember selectively. His own childhood appears through a kind of golden haze: 
"The sun is shining, goodness and mercy are to follow me (it seems) for ever . 
. . fifty years from now I shall still dream at times that I am walking up 
Priory Road." 
</P>
<P>
As Milne himself once announced, "Art is not life, but an exaggeration of it; 
life reinforced by the personality of the artist." And an exaggerated, 
sentimental -- and also sometimes rather condescending -- tone appears at times 
in the "Autobiography," especially when Milne speaks of his father. Describing 
his own departure for boarding school, he writes: 
</P>
<P>
"Farewell, Papa, with your brave, shy heart and your funny little ways; with 
your humour and your wisdom and your never-failing goodness; . . . 'Well,' you 
will tell yourself, 'it lasted until he was twelve; they grow up and resent our 
care for them, they form their own ideas, and think ours old-fashioned. It is 
natural. But oh, to have that little boy again, whom I used to throw up to the 
sky, his face laughing down into mine -- ' " 
</P>
<P>
This nostalgic theme recurs in the Pooh books, particularly in the final 
chapter of "The House at Pooh Corner": 
</P>
<P>
" 'Pooh, when I'm -- you know . . . will you come up here sometimes?' 
</P>
<P>
" 'Just Me?' 
</P>
<P>
" 'Yes, Pooh.' 
</P>
<P>
" 'Will you be here too?' 
</P>
<P>
" 'Yes, Pooh, I will be, really, I promise I will be, Pooh.' 
</P>
<P>
" 'That's good,' said Pooh." 
</P>
<P>
This is also sentimentality, but a sentimentality that rises into pathos, by 
means of the pathetic fallacy. In fact, the world of childhood and the past, 
our discarded toys and landscapes, will not mourn us when we leave; the regret 
will be felt by our own imprisoned earlier selves. Milne ascribes to his father 
and to Pooh the passionate regret he feels for his own lost paradise. 
</P>
<P>
"Winnie-the-Pooh" is essentially a modern version of an archetypal legend. It 
is a very old one (almost the first, in biblical terms) -- the story of a 
peaceful animal kingdom ruled by a single benevolent human being. Milne even 
tells us that Christopher Robin, like Adam, gave names to his subjects. 
</P>
<P>
It seems no accident, therefore, that the threat of change and loss enters this 
Eden in the shape of a tree of knowledge. One day, Christopher Robin is 
discovered to be missing from the Forest. He has gone to school for the first 
time and is learning his alphabet, beginning with the letter A. 
</P>
<P>
Piglet comes across this letter A, arranged on the ground out of three sticks, 
and thinks "that perhaps it was a Trap of some kind." Eeyore, a little later, 
is first respectful and then contemptuous: " 'Clever!' said Eeyore scornfully, 
putting a foot heavily on his three sticks. 'Education!' said Eeyore bitterly, 
jumping on his six sticks. 'What is Learning? . . . A thing Rabbit knows!' " 
</P>
<P>
He is right to be bitter. It is Education that will, by the end of "The House 
at Pooh Corner," have driven Christopher Robin out of his self-created Eden. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder that this particular lost paradise, this small safe, happy place 
where individuality and privacy are respected, should appeal to people growing 
up into a world of telegrams, anger, wiretapping, war, death, and taxes -- 
especially to those who would rather not grow up. 
</P>
<P>
Milne's loosely organized society of unemployed artists and eccentrics, each 
quietly doing his own thing, might have a special attraction for counterculture 
types. For them, Pooh Corner would be both the lost past and the ideal future 
-- at once the golden rural childhood they probably never knew, and the perfect 
commune they are always seeking.

HEALTH: IS A LIVING WILL ENOUGH?; 
</P>
<P>
PATIENTS WHO ESCHEW MASSIVE LIFE-SAVING METHODS CAN'T ALWAYS HAVE THEIR WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIRIAM SHUCHMAN MD and MICHAEL S. WILKES MD, Miriam Shuchman teaches 
psychiatry at Dartmouth Medical School. Michael S. Wilkes is a physician in the 
Clinical Scholars Program at the UCLA Medical Center. Their column appears 
monthly. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
ONCE YOU START the medical ball rolling," a leading heart specialist explained 
to a group of young doctors," it is difficult -- if not impossible -- to stop 
it." The medical system, set up to save lives, is often reluctant to turn away 
from a dying patient -- no matter what the person's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
That was exactly the problem recently for a retired Los Angeles bus driver who 
had been suffering with lung cancer for many months. He knew he might be near 
death, and he and his family had spent many hours talking about how he wanted 
to be cared for as his health worsened. His daughter, a nurse, encouraged the 
discussions, saying she did not want him to suffer needlessly. 
</P>
<P>
The man and his wife met with his doctor to ask questions about what they 
should expect, and the man decided that when his time came, he wanted to go 
quickly. He didn't want doctors to use life-sustaining technology to prolong 
his life. So he put his wishes in writing in what is commonly called a living 
will, but his family soon learned the limitations of such documents. 
</P>
<P>
Early one morning, while standing at the stove preparing breakfast, the man 
felt a sudden, intense pain in his back and cried out. Seconds later he 
collapsed on the floor. When his wife could not rouse him, she telephoned 911 
for help and then quickly dialed her daughter, who happened to live nearby. 
</P>
<P>
The paramedics, who arrived 10 minutes later, found the man unconscious and 
without a pulse. Trying to resuscitate him, they started an intravenous line in 
a vein in his arm and passed a tube through his mouth into his lungs so that 
they could breathe for him. His heart restarted but with a rhythm too fast to 
let him survive. The medics prepared to shock him into a slower, more normal 
heart rate with high-voltage electricity, using a defibrillator. 
</P>
<P>
When the man's daughter arrived, she saw her father lying unconscious on the 
floor with several tubes in his mouth and arms and a medic applying 
defibrillator paddles to his chest. "Please stop," she said. "My father wants 
to die without a massive resuscitation effort." But it was too late; the system 
had already been set into action. 
</P>
<P>
Although the man had a living will, such wills do not apply during emergencies, 
whether they're outside a hospital or in a hospital emergency room. Emergency 
rescue teams must of necessity "act first and ask questions later." Otherwise, 
they will lose crucial time that is needed to save a person's life. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of this man, the medics explained to his daughter, they had to 
follow planned procedures; they had no choice. They put the man in the 
ambulance and rushed him to the nearest hospital. There, emergency room doctors 
and nurses set to work -- drawing blood samples, attaching wires and hooking 
him up to a respirator. Soon he was taken to the intensive-care unit, 
Heremained unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
In the ICU, his wife and daughter were finally able to approach one of the 
doctors, who told them that despite everyone's best efforts, the man's chance 
for recovery was slim (he had been without a pulse for more than eight minutes) 
and that he probably would remain unconscious until he died. 
</P>
<P>
Again the daughter explained about the living will and asked that her father be 
allowed to die without being hooked up to machines. The doctor said that while 
he would not provide aggressive care in the future, he felt he was unable at 
that time to disconnect the respirator. 
</P>
<P>
The man's living will was supposed to go into effect when he was both 
terminally ill and mentally incompetent. In fact, this is always the case with 
living wills: They are only referred to when the patient can no longer think 
clearly or is unable to communicate. Yet in this case, the living will wasn't 
sufficient to carry out the man's wishes. This time, the doctor's own feelings 
about medical ethics stood in the way -- even though they were at odds with the 
established consensus in medicine and law. Medical ethicists insist there is no 
difference, ethically, between discontinuing a treatment already in place and 
not starting a new treatment. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of this man, says Dr. Chuck Culver, a physician-ethicist at 
Dartmouth Medical Center who has written on allowing patients to die, "once the 
gravity of the situation was clear, then treatment could have been stopped." 
Legally, California doctors have been permitted by the courts to turn off 
respirators in such of cases. But this doctor didn't want to do so. As an 
alternative, he offered to have the hospital ethicist review the situation. 
</P>
<P>
By this point, the family was emotionally exhausted. The course of events might 
have been different if, instead of signing a living will, the man had empowered 
his daughter or wife to make medical decisions for him. 
</P>
<P>
Living wills are vague, so it is more effective for people who want to control 
the care they receive at the end of life to instead grant "durable power of 
attorney for health care" to a friend or family member. That person can then 
make medical decisions when the patient is no longer competent. In this case, 
the man's daughter, if she had durable power of attorney, would have been able 
to make decisions for her father as if he were making them himself. 
</P>
<P>
Over the first five days of the man's stay in the ICU, a machine breathed for 
him. He never awoke from his coma, and the doctors did not expect that he 
would. Meanwhile, the ethics committee reviewed the case and supported the 
family's request. The committee said the hospital should abide by what the man 
himself would have wanted. It interviewed family members and the family doctor 
and concluded that if the man had been able to direct the doctors's actions, he 
would have asked that the machines be unplugged. As a result of the ethics 
consultation, the man was taken off the respirator. He breathed on his own for 
about a day. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, on the fifth night, his heart stopped. Several minutes later, the 
doctor discontinued the electrical monitors and pronounced him dead. 
</P>
<P>
Decisions about whether to withdraw treatment from a patient are difficult. 
Living wills and, even more, the assigning of a durable power of attorney for 
health care, can help clarify what a patient would have wanted. 
</P>
<P>
Since California passed the first "natural death" law in 1976, 40 states have 
legalized some form of living will, and many states, including California, 
permit the granting of durable power of attorney for health care to a person 
who will act on behalf of another. When no formal arrangements have been made, 
and when disagreement about a dying person's wishes persists, it may be helpful 
to ask whether an ethics consultant can review the particular case.

FASHION: JAMES TARANTINO MAKES DRESSING SIMPLY ELEGANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Barbara Foley 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMES TARANTINO COULD be dubbed the new Mr. Clean. In the fashion industry, such 
high praise is reserved for the very few -- Balenciaga in the '50s, Halston in 
the '70s and Armani in the '80s -- who turn tides with nuances rather than 
grand gestures. Such designers are beyond fad, perfectly in tune with the way 
women want to look: dignified, feminine, sensual. 
</P>
<P>
At 30 and in business only since 1986, Tarantino has already developed a clear 
vision. In 1986, he won the California Mart's Rising Star Award, and this year 
Christian Lacroix presented him with the Fil d'Argent Award for new designers 
at the International Linen Festival in Monte Carlo. 
</P>
<P>
Tarantino, who studied at the Parsons School of Design, works in a small 
downtown Los Angeles studio, making modern clothes the old-fashioned way: 
sketching, draping, fitting and working out original ideas. The result is 
classically styled, high-quality dresses and suits with his distinctive, sleek 
signature. Tarantino's clothes are made in upbeat colors and crisp fabrics that 
glide over a woman's body, accentuating curves gracefully. They're no-nonsense, 
smart clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Bloomingdale's discovered Tarantino about a year ago when its East Coast 
merchandise marauders arrived to put together a storewide spring 1989 
California promotion. Tarantino's work was a great success, says Barbara 
Kennedy, merchandise vice president of dresses, coats and suits for 
Bloomingdale's. "We reordered almost every style, and for fall we sold out, 
too. His is a very sophisticated taste level." 
</P>
<P>
Customers recognize that. "I grew up wearing my grandmother's Galanos and 
Geoffrey Beene, so I'm not that easy to please," says Wendy Fritz of Chicago, 
New York and Palm Beach. "James' clothes are elegant, simple and finished so 
well. They fit like Claude Montana or Thierry Mugler and when I wear them, 
everyone wants to know who the designer is. They're delighted when they learn 
about the price." 
</P>
<P>
An average dress sells for about $380, a suit about $550, which is less than 
what some designers charge. It's an investment that requires some thought, but 
not serious debt, at stores including Nordstrom, Bullocks, I. Magnin, Saks 
Fifth Avenue, Fred Segal Santa Monica and Ron Ross in Encino.Barbara Foley

<P>
IT'S NOT UNUSUAL to see customers at the new J. Crew store wandering around, 
touching all the merchandise. Shopping here is a more tactile experience than 
usual, because this is the first Southern California retail outlet for J. Crew, 
which for years has offered its men's and women's sportswear basics and dressy 
separates only through catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
Available for hands-on examination are J. Crew's endless variations on unisex 
wardrobe essentials: cotton polo shirts, T-shirts, rugby shirts, turtlenecks 
and sweaters (from about $12 to $50). The store also features men's sportcoats 
(about $175) and women's wool pleated pants, silk blouses and tailored rayon 
jackets ($70 and up). And underwear, shoes, pajamas, belts, swimsuits, hats, 
ties and handbags are offered.

Although not all catalogue merchandise is stocked in the store, the shop does 
have some exclusive items not found in the catalogue. The minimalistic design 
of the store itself is an oasis of calm in the frantic fever of the mall.

ROREM: "A QUAKER READER," "VIEWS FROM THE OLDEST HOUSE." Catherine Crozier, 
organ. 
</P>
<P>
Delos D/CD 3076(compact disc). These two suites of pictorial miniatures hold a 
wide range of colors and impressions, presented in a tonal language both 
sophisticated and accessible. "A Quaker Reader," with its evocations of martyrs 
and ecstasies, is the more flamboyant, but both offer grateful and 
demonstrative work to the performer. Crozier plays them with clarity and 
passion, on the Marcussen organ at Wichita State University. JOHN HENKEN

MISSION U.K. -- -- * 1/2 
</P>
<P>
"Carved in Sand" 
</P>
<P>
Mercury/Polygram 
</P>
<P>
The passion, the passion. The horror, the horror. Listening to Mission U.K. 
frontman Wayne Hussey sing his dedicated innards out on song after song here, 
as if raging with every last gulp of air against the dying of some light or 
another, you may find yourself wondering,"Didn't Englishmen used to be 
reserved?" Moreover, you may wish they still were after suffering Hussey's 
unbridled intensity through 10 unforgiving, aggravated tracks. 
</P>
<P>
In the opening "Amelia," the most unsubtle look possible at father/daughter 
incest, the anger Hussey expresses is, of course, justified, if way over the 
top for musical purposes. This subject has obviously distressed him so that he 
stays in the same mood for the rest of the album, regardless of lyric. Whether 
it's realistic, socially relevant rock ("Grapes of Wrath," for the workin' man) 
or the plethora of moody love songs embracing tacky mythological imagery 
("Mistress of Avalon cast a spell" and so on), Hussey just sounds royally 
ticked off, with few breaks from the relentless gush of indignancy and ardor.

IDOL WORSHIP: Billy Idol is still in the hospital, recovering from a nasty 
motorcycle spill. But Chrysalis Records says plans to release the rock singer's 
new album, "Charmed Life," remain on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Due out April 17, the aptly-titled record features "Cradle of Love" (due out as 
a single), "Prodigal Blues," "Trouble With the Sweet Stuff," "License to 
Thrill" and a remake of the Doors' "L.A. Woman." Idol's "Cradle of Love" will 
also be on the Elektra soundtrack to "Ford Fairlane," the Andrew (Dice) Clay 
film due out this summer. . . . A Truth in Advertising Raspberry to KLOS-FM, 
which had replacement deejays tell listeners that morning hot-shots Mark &amp; 
Brian were off-the-air last week, allegedly because of a dispute over a 
disciplinary memo from management. The clever ratings ploy was in perfect sync 
with the duo's bad-boy image -- and kept listeners tuning in daily to see if 
the jocks had returned. The reality? Mark &amp; Brian were simply on vacation. 
. . . And our Blunder of the Week goes to Hollywood Reporter reviewer Jeffrey 
Jolson-Colburn, who expressed "disappointment" in his Monday review of the 
recent Tears for Fears concert that the group "didn't perform a few of the 
tunes they created with (Liza Minnelli) for her brilliant 'Results' album . . . 
" Only one problem: Liza made "Results" with the Pet Shop Boys, not Tears for 
Fears.

POP EYE: THE HALF-AMAZING, HALF-CRAZY GREENING OF CD SOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It sounds crazy. Completely wacko. Like one of those "I Was Kidnapped by a Sexy 
UFO Hunk" tales you'd expect to read in the tabloids in the check-out lane at 
Ralphs. 
</P>
<P>
But how's this for a shocker: If the stories circulating in the audiophile 
community are true, you can significantly improve the sound of your compact 
discs (are you sitting down?) simply by marking the inner and outer edges of 
the disc with a green felt marking pen. 
</P>
<P>
Call it the Big Green Clean. 
</P>
<P>
It's the hot new topic of debate among CD fanatics -- and a claim being taken 
seriously by CD experts, most notably Pete Howard, publisher of the respected 
International CD Exchange (ICE) newsletter and resident Rolling Stone CD 
columnist. Howard says he discovered the craze when one of his subscribers sent 
him a story from a Beaverton, Ore., paper detailing claims made by an audio 
store owner there. 
</P>
<P>
After interviewing several other people who've tested out the theory -- and 
trying it himself -- Howard is no longer a complete skeptic. 
</P>
<P>
"I was intrigued, as would anyone who discovered that you could make what 
amounts to a $1,000 upgrade on your sound system by simply spending $1.25 for a 
green felt marking pen," he said. "I think you'd have to say it's half-amazing 
and half-ludicrous. But I'm getting calls from people who are using adjectives 
like 'incredible' and 'terrifyingly improved.' Everybody seems to agree there's 
something there." 
</P>
<P>
The green felt marker fad isn't the only craze sweeping the CD ranks. According 
to a four-page story by Sam Tellig in the current issue of Stereophile 
magazine, you can also improve CD sound quality by coating your CDs with (now 
you really have to sit down) Armor-All spray cleaner. (You coat the playing 
surface and wash off the Armor-All before playing.) 
</P>
<P>
Both schemes sound pretty farfetched to us. But Howard isn't so sure. "What 
makes this such a potentially fascinating story is the implication that after 
millions of CDs have been tested and manufactured, consumers can suddenly buy a 
green marking pen or a cleaning spray cleaner and dramatically increase their 
CD sound. Enough people have come to me that you'd have to say something is 
happening here, even if you don't know what it is." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, none of the Green Clean proponents can explain why the marking 
pen works. And it's too soon for official test results from audio authorities. 
Is there a sound technological principle at work? Not likely, says Ed Outwater, 
Warner Bros. Records' vice president of CD quality assurance. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't sound like this is within the realm of possibility to me," said 
Outwater. "A CD operates by a laser bouncing up into the play-side of the 
machine, where it reads the digital information. So how a green felt pen 
marking on the outside of the disc would have any impact is beyond me." 
</P>
<P>
Outwater was similarly skeptical about the oven-cleaner hypothesis. "CDs do get 
dirty, but the grunge simply impedes tracking. Cleaning the disc won't improve 
the sound clarity." 
</P>
<P>
For a second opinion, Pop Eye asked Grammy-winning producer Hank Neuberger, an 
audio consultant for the recent Grammy telecast, to take a Green Clean 
blind-fold test. Neuberger listened to two CD versions -- one greened, the 
other unmarked -- of Steely Dan's "Hey 19" and the Band's "King Harvest." The 
results?: 
</P>
<P>
"Granted, it wasn't the most scientific experiment, but I really don't think 
you could hear much difference," he said. "Maybe the green-coated CD had a 
little more clarity in the upper-middle range. But it was very subtle, if 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Neuberger said the craze reminded him of the hubbub nearly a decade ago when 
Bob Clearmountain, then a hot rock producer, began mixing albums on tiny Yamaha 
NS-10 studio speakers. "Everyone heard he got his special sound by taping 
Kleenex over the tweeters," Neuberger said. "So not only did everyone go out 
and buy NS-10's, which are now standard in every studio in the world, but 
everyone was asking -- what kind of Kleenex did he use?"

FIGHT THE POWER: Is Public Enemy, the rap world's most provocative band, 
blacklisted from "The Arsenio Hall Show"? That's what Public Enemy leader Chuck 
D says in the new issue of Spin magazine. It's a charge supported by the fact 
that Hall's adventuresome show has championed nearly every major rap act over 
the past year -- except Public Enemy, who were in town last week for a pair of 
shows at the Palace. 
</P>
<P>
"Spike Lee told me it was because Public Enemy and him are a posse and Arsenio 
doesn't like Spike," Chuck D told Spin. "But I think that the deep down fact is 
that Arsenio is just plain scared." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Arsenio fears a "black planet," Chuck D responded: "I don't know if 
that's true because I think his planet to him is his whole ego. He's just 
playing it safe. He doesn't want to put us on his show because he's scared to 
lose sponsors. Now the media have tagged us as racists, it's the only excuse he 
needs." 
</P>
<P>
Hall's publicist said the talk-show host had "no comment" on the charges.

PLAYWRIGHT MAYO SIMON HAS HAD A HARD YEAR -- HIS WORKS HAVE DIED OFF-STAGE, HIS 
CALLS AREN'T BEING RETURNED -- BUT HE'S PHILOSOPHICAL 
</P>

This week, you will not enter the new Center Theatre of the Long Beach 
Convention and Entertainment Complex. There you will not witness the Southern 
California premiere of "Elaine's Daughter." 
</P>
<P>
In January -- after announcing an ambitious new season of plays by a new 
company of players, the Long Beach Repertory Theater, after mailing flyers 
inviting season subscriptions sales, after casting the actors, designers, 
director -- the Long Beach Regional Arts Foundation pulled the plug. Everything 
-- premiere, gala, season -- sank, canceled for lack of finances. 
</P>
<P>
And the playwright? In the wake of his non-opening, how is Mayo Simon handling 
disappointment? Is he in intensive therapy? Is he peering at the bottom of a 
long weekend's whiskey glass? 
</P>
<P>
Calmly, philosophically, with no edge of rage or suicidal depression, the 
playwright answered: "I've been reviewing the last year of my life." 
</P>
<P>
By others' standards, it was not a very good year. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the cancellation of "Elaine's Daughter," 1989-'90 saw Simon's previous 
play, "These Men," rejected for a Paris production because of its "vulgar 
language." Now its English opening has been delayed by London's leading fringe 
theater, The King's Head, so often that, Simon said, "I'm beginning to think it 
will never open." The Philadelphia Theatre Company, while negotiating with 
Simon a commission for a new play, went out of business. New York's Public 
Theater, supposedly committed to a staged reading of Simon's latest work, 
"Angel," suddenly isn't returning phone calls. And a Broadway option on 
"Elaine's Daughter" just lapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Pass the hemlock? Not for Simon. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a year in which everything has collapsed around me," he said. 
"But I feel pretty good because for the first year in over 30 years of being a 
writer, I can now get up in the morning and write exactly what I want to." 
</P>
<P>
That's because Simon has done the unthinkable in Hollywood: turn his back on a 
lucrative film and television career to write plays full time. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Simon, and his wife, Sondra, decided to sell their 11-room French 
country chateau in Pacific Palisades to finance a change in career focus. They 
were encouraged in this decision by their children. Joel, an Internal Revenue 
Service accountant, and Rafael, a UC Berkeley graduate student, viewed the home 
as merely a financial asset. Their daughters Anne, a University of 
Massachusetts molecular biologist, and Francesca, a London play scout for the 
Mark Taper Forum, "gently pushed us in the direction of selling the house." 
</P>
<P>
"I got all that money and bought a much smaller four-room house nearby in 
Pacific Palisades," Simon said. "Now I don't have money problems and no longer 
have to do television and films. Selling that house at the top of the real 
estate market is the one thing this year that really worked out." 
</P>
<P>
But if all his play plans had materialized, Simon estimated that he would have 
made only $20,000 -- for the entire year -- less than half his pay for a 
half-hour television pilot. This is a smart career move? 
</P>
<P>
"I consider $20,000 a lot of money now," said the 61-year-old. "When you're 
young, it doesn't matter what you write. A half-hour comedy pilot? Wonderful. 
Big movie? Terrific! Whether they make it or not, it's all fun. But after a 
certain point, when you write a thing that's really good and they don't make 
it, you say, 'I've wasted a year on this project. I don't care what money I 
earned, I can't get that year back. That year is gone.' So $60,000 is not good 
money anymore. When you're 30 it's wonderful. When you're 60 it's not good 
money." 
</P>
<P>
His self-imposed Hollywood exile is frequently put to the test. An independent 
film producer recently telephoned about a movie-of-the-week treatment Simon 
wrote 10 years ago. "I can sell it now," the producer said, "your concept's 
hot!" Simon offered only the treatment, refusing to write the screenplay 
despite the offer of a high fee. 
</P>
<P>
"It would take a year to write the script," Simon said of the proposed 
television movie, "and then it would probably never get made. Getting 
well-produced in a 99-seat theater in front of an audience that appreciates 
what you're written is very satisfying. When something you've done is 
successful on television, nobody but your wife knows you've done it." 
</P>
<P>
He proves his point by referring to a recent Gene Siskell and Roger Ebert 
television program. The popular movie critics were listing their choices for 
the 10 best films of the 1980s. "It was amazing to discover that none of the 
best films of the past 10 years were written," Simon said in feigned awe. "The 
stories and dialogue just magically sprang from actors and directors." 
</P>
<P>
Simon remembers when he first realized the Hollywood writer's actual status 
within the industry. It was 1967, during the star-studded premiere of 
"Marooned" at the Egyptian Theater on Hollywood Boulevard. He had worked three 
well-paid years writing the space epic, his first major writing job since 
coming to Los Angeles in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1950s in New York, as a live television writer for "Studio One" and 
"Playhouse 90," executives and craftsmen had treated Simon like -- well, like a 
playwright. So, at his first big Hollywood premiere, he anticipated similar 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
After taking his seat in the Egyptian, Simon opened the studio's glossy color 
brochure. On the first page were listed "the creators" of "Marooned": the 
producer and the director. Then Simon found page after page on the stars of 
"Marooned." Then more pages on the special effects personnel. Where was the 
writer? Finally, at the back of the brochure, alongside the assistant director 
and the assistant cameraman, he found his name. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, they like me," Simon said. "The studio took out ads in the Writers Guild 
monthly magazine for me. But their view of how I fit in with the hierarchy was 
down with the assistant director. That moment made a big impression on me." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, prior to that Hollywood opening, Simon had enjoyed his first major 
theatrical premiere with "Walking to Waldheim" at New York's Lincoln Center. 
But at that time in his life the stage wasn't a serious temptation. 
</P>
<P>
The critics slammed the play. And he had just written an Oscar-winning 
documentary, "Why Man Creates." He remembers the studios called him "a very 
promising up-and-coming motion picture writer." 
</P>
<P>
But screenwriters were second-class citizens, mechanics for hire. His work on 
Judy Garland's last movie, "I Could Wake Up Singing," became "a ghastly 
nightmare": his secret rewritings of a writer were being secretly rewritten by 
yet a third writer. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a kind of madness to the whole thing," he said. "When you finish, 
all you can be proud of is the fact that you're still alive, not that it made a 
magnificent picture or somehow you had a personal success." 
</P>
<P>
And Simon said he has watched it get worse, not better. For the Writers Guild, 
Simon recently sat on a panel arbitrating screenplay credit for a film. There 
were 21 scripts by eight writers -- for the same movie. This horrifies Simon, 
who apprenticed under the late Robert Penn Warren, the American poet laureate, 
at the University of Minnesota and who brings an almost religious devotion to 
his work. Writing, for Simon, is a literary act of faith, a profound gesture 
toward "communication and insight." 
</P>
<P>
So in the 1970s, seeking artistic satisfaction, Simon began to use Hollywood as 
the financial backer of his plays. He would average a year and a half creating 
"The Man From Atlantis" for NBC or writing a film such as "Future World." Then 
for the next year and a half he would live off the industry profits while 
writing a play. 
</P>
<P>
But it was always difficult to make the transition between screen and stage, 
sometimes requiring two or three months before he could think in the opposite 
genre's terms. "For a film, your point of view is extremely flexible," he said. 
"The audience wants everything shown. But on a stage, you tend not to show what 
you're talking about. A theater audience is much readier to go with its 
imagination than a film audience. The stage is filled with what you imagine." 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, Simon was not seriously bothered by such conflicts. Between 
film and television assignments, Simon wrote plays. "L.A. Under Siege" was 
produced by the Mark Taper Forum in 1970. Three one-acts titled "Double Murder 
and Suicide" were written in the mid-1970s but not done until 1982 by the Los 
Angeles Actors Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
But "These Men" in 1980 made Simon reassess his double creative life. The play 
examined how the feminist revolution changed women's sexual lives. Before its 
off-Broadway production, producer Fred Coe took Simon out to a business lunch 
and asked him, "How would you like your characters costumed?" 
</P>
<P>
Simon was stunned. 
</P>
<P>
"I was coming from Hollywood where they're not interested in the writer's views 
on costumes," Simon said, "or on anything else. I didn't know what to say. Then 
he said, 'Well, Pappy, you're the boss.' This was not said ironically. He was 
dead serious. They were there to please me. I had been a writer for 20 years in 
television and film; never once had a producer turned to see what I thought of 
an actor. It was a very heady experience." 
</P>
<P>
Then when Simon studied the contract for "These Men," he realized that, unlike 
screenplay contracts, he was the author. No one could touch his play without 
his permission. In Hollywood, every contract made the buyer the author, while 
writers became paid employees. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you how many times every author has been called on the phone by 
his agent to say, 'Well, kid, here's the story: the company thinks you're kind 
of tired so they're hired these other writers.' They don't even call you 
themselves. In Hollywood, every writer knows he's there to be replaced by 
somebody else." 
</P>
<P>
Although "These Men" was savaged by the New York critics, a revised version at 
London's Bush Theater in 1981 became a sensational hit. In 1985, the Los 
Angeles Theater Center premiered "A Rich Full Life," his contemporary sequel to 
"A Doll's House." 
</P>
<P>
Simon continued his difficult transitions between mediums. He forged a 
collaborative relationship with director Jules Aaron, who guided "Elaine's 
Daughter" into the 1987 Actors Theatre of Louisville's Humana Festival of New 
American plays. There Simon began thinking the unthinkable: entirely severing 
his Hollywood involvements. 
</P>
<P>
His first day at Louisville, Artistic Director Jon Jory called everyone 
involved with the festival to a meeting. Jory announced that he wanted to 
introduce the stars of the Festival. Simon looked around, thinking, "Oh, have 
the stars arrived?" Then Jory began introducing the writers. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe it," Simon said. "I wanted to run up and hug and kiss him." 
</P>
<P>
"Elaine's Daughter" became the hit of the festival. The New York Times called 
it "the brightest play of the weekend, a sharp-sighted little comedy about a 
generational conflict between opposites." 
</P>
<P>
But the next year was spent writing a movie of the week for Columbia, "Victory 
at Pearl," about construction workers rescuing sailors during the Japanese 
attack on Pearl Harbor. Simon felt it was perhaps the finest screenplay he had 
ever written. It was never made. 
</P>
<P>
"If I can't get this one made," he thought, "What am I doing here?" 
</P>
<P>
When Gary Marsh, one of the Columbia executives working on "Victory at Pearl," 
called to ask him to write another original film script, Simon made his 
decision. "I can't do it," he told the producer, "I'm going to just write 
plays." 
</P>
<P>
"As disappointing as it was to me," said Marsh, now vice president of original 
programming for the Disney Channel, "I respected his decision to control his 
own creative destiny. Simon's writing really cut to the essence of what the 
human spirit is really about. He's at the point we all want to be someday, to 
have enough money to do what he wants. That I respect." 
</P>
<P>
"It was the first guy in the business I said 'no' to," Simon said. "Suddenly we 
had no income. I had to sell the house." 
</P>
<P>
Any regrets? 
</P>
<P>
"I made $284 for 13 performances in a theater that seated 174 people," Simon 
said of his Louisville festival experience. "And it was the best five weeks I 
ever had. I wouldn't trade it for anything. It was my play -- the way I'd 
written it -- beautifully done up on the stage for a great audience, with 30 
critics from all over the country saying 'this is terrific.' I wouldn't give 
that up for anything." 
</P>
<P>
But, seriously, after the non-opening of a play he spent over two years 
researching and writing, isn't there some depression? Some impulse to call his 
Hollywood connections and make a deal? 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago I would have been devastated by this," Simon said of the Long 
Beach reversal. "But I've had so many of these things happen to me that it 
doesn't make any difference now. These disappointments don't keep me from 
enjoying my life as a playwright. At Louisville, everybody said 'Elaine's 
Daughter' will go to Broadway. It didn't -- maybe it never will. I mean, it 
didn't even go to Long Beach!"

BLACK ART EXHIBITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wilson is jubilant over the fact that there "has never been a historical 
American art survey exhibition of this magnitude focused on black people." 
</P>
<P>
An exhibition of this magnitude should bring about careful consideration on how 
blacks were viewed by an ignorant Caucasian society at the time that the art 
was created. 
</P>
<P>
It is art that depicts this clearly and fascinatingly. 
</P>
<P>
However, Wilson becomes a bit uncomfortable with the ideas of curator Guy C. 
McElroy. Wilson only sees racism in the blatantly stupid caricatures but fails 
to see the racism in those less forthright. He accepts that there is "no reason 
to doubt that McElroy sees racism in these works." 
</P>
<P>
However, he pitifully reprimands McElroy, saying the only reason he sees it is 
because he is looking for it! 
</P>
<P>
With even limited knowledge of the experiences of the black race, it is easy to 
see how whites have taken advantage of their power and abused it. So, you don't 
want to look for racism in these pictures, Mr. Wilson? Then why do you seek to 
glorify those pictures that don't? Sure, there is art that doesn't condescend 
to the black race; but why do you have to justify yourself and dismiss the 
racial ones? 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Wilson also states "having an ax to grind is as American as fast food, but 
forging one's blade against the soft soapstone of art may not be the most 
appropriate use of objects made for aesthetic delectation." Beautiful use of 
words, but ugly idea. It's like, "Let's not dirty a sacred culture such as art 
with controversy." Please look harder and deeper. By doing this, we can learn 
from our past to help our future.

ART NOTEBOOK: CURE GALLERY PUTS PERCENTAGE OF PROFIT INTO ARTISTS' FAVORED 
CAUSES 
</P>

KINDER, GENTLER ART SALES: Arguing that the 1990s will be a decade of 
heightened social responsibility, the Cure Gallery is putting its money where 
its name is. In a novel sales policy, the gallery is donating 10% of the 
proceeds from its exhibitions to a charity selected by the featured artist. The 
AIDS Hospice Foundation, for instance, has been chosen by Keith Anderson, a 
young artist who applies a sensibility reminiscent of the German Expressionists 
to modern political and emotional themes. Anderson's work will be shown March 8 
to April 2. 
</P>
<P>
Other shows and the charities selected include a group exhibit that will 
benefit People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals; an exhibition of abstract 
works by the Swedish painter Sven Inge, to benefit the Rain Forest Foundation, 
and a show of paintings by a Rothko-inspired young Texas painter named Terrel 
Moore that will benefit the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"The '80s were a decade of 'me'; the '90s, we feel, will be more a decade of 
'we,' " said Philip Miller, co-owner of Cure, which opened in October. Noting 
that artists -- especially the "very contemporary" and emerging artists favored 
by the gallery -- often can't afford to make sizable contributions to charity 
on their own, Miller said, "We feel it needs to start on a commercial level and 
trickle down." 
</P>
<P>
For collectors, Miller and his partner, Marc Erlandson, say, there's an added 
incentive in the gallery policy: 10% of a purchase price is tax deductible. 
</P>
<P>
 Cure Gallery, 8022 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles. (213) 653-3877. Open 11 a.m. to 
7 p.m. Tuesdays through Fridays and 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturdays. Opening 
reception for Keith Anderson will be from 6 to 9 p.m. Thursday.

 CLASSIC TRANSPLANT: New York has lost another well-respected art dealer to Los 
Angeles -- this one, however, not in the contemporary field. Since 1986, Aldis 
Browne, who specializes in major 19th- and early 20th-Century European art, has 
been dividing his time between his Madison Avenue gallery in New York and Los 
Angeles, where he has been operating as a private dealer. In 1988, Browne held 
a six-week catalogued exhibition and sale of Old Master drawings and 
watercolors from the collection of Vincent Price in Los Angeles. In helping 
clients to build collections, he said, he generally handles everything from 
Matisse watercolors to top works by Cezanne and Van Gogh (yes, sometimes in 
those hard-to-believe high-market ranges). 
</P>
<P>
Early this year, Browne -- whose clients also have included the J. Paul Getty 
Museum -- incorporated in California. As soon as he winds up his operation in 
New York, he'll be operating from his new base in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
When he first talked about moving to Los Angeles, Browne said, his New York 
peers were incredulous. "They told me I'd be crazy to do it, that I'd be back 
in a couple of months," he said. But with Los Angeles (and the Pacific Rim, for 
that matter) now perceived as a growing market, that tune has changed. Just 
recently, Browne said, "a major Old-Master dealer in New York called and asked 
me about moving to Santa Monica." 
</P>
<P>
The infusion of some nationally recognized dealers in older art could be a boon 
to the art market in Los Angeles, which is seen primarily as a 
contemporary-arts arena. In fact, "L.A. has a pretty good wealth of pictures 
that came out years ago," Browne said, "although most of the collecting is 
contemporary." 
</P>
<P>
Browne would like to provide an alternative. But should nothing else come of 
his move, he said from New York, "I tell you what -- I'll be the warmer for it. 
It's freezing out here."

HE'LL TURN 90 DIRECTING 'WOYZECK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It took a long time, but I fell in love with the play," said Martin Magner of 
Georg Buchner's "Woyzeck" which opens this weekend, with a new translation by 
Carl R. Mueller, at the Harman Avenue Theatre in Hollywood. "I read it when I 
was a young man, but I've never directed it," added the German-born director, 
who'll turn 90 tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it needs a certain maturity. Perhaps I'm approaching it." 
</P>
<P>
Written in 1836, Buchner's work -- which Magner points to as a predecessor of 
Wedekind's, Pinter's and Genet's -- has often found itself the subject of 
contemporary stagings. "It has so much to say to us today," the director said. 
"Somehow you don't feel it's been written many years ago. It is really the 
beginning of Expressionism in the world: an electrifying play, filled with 
progressiveness, humanity and compassion. It stands for the rights of man." 
</P>
<P>
But, for his 90th birthday, wouldn't Magner rather do something a bit more ... 
festive? "There's festivity in a good catharsis -- a cleansing of the mind," he 
said lightly. Magner, recipient of the 1989 Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle 
Lifetime Distinguished Achievement Award, added: "I wanted to do something that 
means something, that has gravity. I've done so much fluff in my life." JANICE

MOTTOLA AND MUSIC

<TEXT>
<P>
Minor quibbles with your article on Tommy Mottola: 
</P>
<P>
 -- He sang a line in the song titled "Gino (the Manager)" on the Hall and 
Oates album called "Daryl Hall and John Oates." 
</P>
<P>
(The jacket insert includes the line, "And introducing Tommy Mottola as 'Little 
Gino.' ") 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hilburn's analysis of "Cherchez la Femme" is all wrong: Tommy is "alone, no 
woman and no home" at the end of the first verse, and the boyfriend of Miggie 
Bonija is the one working at two bars on Eighth Avenue in the second verse. 
</P>
<P>
I sure hope the rest of the article was accurate.

EXPLORING AN EXPLORER'S SEXUAL LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing in response to Spero Kessaris' Feb. 25 letter, in which he 
condemns director Bob Rafelson for suggesting that Sir Richard Burton, the hero 
of Rafelson's film "Mountains of the Moon," might have had a homosexual 
relationship with John Hanning Speke. 
</P>
<P>
Like Kessaris, I am a "Burtonophile," one of the secretive company who believes 
this great man of the 19th Century represents everything lacking from our 
world: an insatiable curiosity for the unknown, unbounded intellectual and 
physical courage, a swashbuckling style. 
</P>
<P>
We tend to be possessive about Burton, which is why we all loathe his wife, 
Isabel, who felt the same way. In fact, she was so determined to re-create him 
that on the night of his death in 1890 she burned thousands of his papers and 
manuscripts, including his private journal. This journal might have provided 
the answers to hundreds of questions about Burton's life, including whether he 
ever engaged in homosexual acts. 
</P>
<P>
We know he had an intense interest in sexual customs -- witness his 
translations of the Kamasutra and "The Perfumed Garden," as well as his 
treatise on homosexuality, "The Sotadic Zone." We know that while in the Indian 
army he prepared a detailed report on the homosexual brothels in Kashmir, and 
this report later ruined his fortunes in the army -- his superiors wondered how 
he could have known so much about these vices without participating in them. 
</P>
<P>
Lastly, we know that Burton happily flouted all social or sexual mores -- if he 
wanted to sleep with a man, he would have done so and then blithely written a 
text on the experience. 
</P>
<P>
That his more rigid wife chose to destroy his journals gives a hint as to their 
possible contents. 
</P>
<P>
As for John Hanning Speke, he had no interest in women, and his descriptions of 
the sexual exploits of the African chieftains he visited does have a strong 
trace of revulsion for their heterosexual lasciviousness. Certainly his 
relationship with Burton was strongly emotional -- and there is no more reason 
to assume that there couldn't have been a sexual element than there is to 
assume there was one.

AFTER EVERY interior detail is perfect, it's time to focus on the light-switch 
plates. Kevin Loughran, who describes his customers as "people who are 
sensitive to subtle details in their environment," has made a specialty of 
handcrafting wall plates. 
</P>
<P>
Yellow-toned brass shapes mix and match with silver and copper accents. 
Loughran also uses verdigris (turquoise-colored oxidized copper). 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the plates, he's done knobs and pulls, doorbell covers and 
plates to hide smoke alarms and thermostats. "There are ugly things that 
society decides we have to live with. We can hide them and make them 
beautiful," Loughran says. Used to filling orders for decorators, he is open to 
suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
Loughran is a jewelry maker who started as a painter, moved on to etchings and 
then finally to metalwork. Living in San Francisco nine years ago, he made a 
few switch plates for his own Victorian house. He guessed correctly that there 
was a market for them. He has been making them ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Switch plates sell for between $20 and $300. Simple dimmer switches start at 
$40; the most elaborate ones are $200. Although Loughran has an inventory of 
standard sizes and shapes, he will do custom configurations for unusual 
switches and problem areas where a normal plate won't fit.

PROUD PARENTS RENT HER STORKS TO HERALD LITTLE BUNDLES OF JOY

CONCORD, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Cynthia Mastropiero had a baby earlier this year, everyone in her Danville 
neighborhood knew about it. 
</P>
<P>
The pink, seven-foot wooden stork on her front lawn was a dead giveaway. 
</P>
<P>
Mastropiero is one of many area women who have announced their motherhood in 
this colorful manner, giving birth to a fanciful business. 
</P>
<P>
Concord resident Liz Seaholm didn't expect much when she decided to build a 
small flock of one-dimensional, wooden storks and rent them to proud new 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it would just be a passing fad," Seaholm said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Stork Delivery Inc. is fielding inquiries about establishing possible 
franchises in Florida, Illinois and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Seaholm, 32, isn't quite ready to take that step, but she envisions the day 
when her fledgling business will hatch more storks. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm starting to think that I will have so many storks that I won't be able to 
haul them around or store them in my garage," Seaholm said. 
</P>
<P>
There have only been four bigger-than-life storks since Seaholm started the 
business in mid-1988. Two are painted with pink clothes and two with blue 
clothes. The pink storks herald the arrival of a baby girl and the blue hail 
the birth of a boy. 
</P>
<P>
The storks remain on the parents' lawn for three to seven days at a price 
ranging from $35 to $55. By renting an average of three storks per week, 
Seaholm estimates her business has collected more than $2,000 so far. 
</P>
<P>
The gangling birds return to Seaholm's nest at the end of the rental period, 
but the parents do get a keepsake from the spectacle: a hand-painted bundle 
bearing the baby's name, date of birth and weight. The bundle dangles from the 
stork's beak during the lawn vigil. 
</P>
<P>
"There is also a potential hidden benefit," Seaholm said. "One lady told me the 
whole neighborhood comes and showers you with gifts when they see this in your 
lawn." 
</P>
<P>
Gina Santucci, who rented a blue stork to announce her son's Jan. 17 birth, 
didn't get any extra gifts, but "all the neighbors have commented on it. It's 
been a big hit." 
</P>
<P>
Seaholm doesn't bear the markings of someone who would go into the stork 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Until 1983, she worked as a data-processing manager for the Federal Reserve 
Bank in San Francisco. She left the Fed after the birth of the first of three 
children. 
</P>
<P>
The stork-on-the-lawn concept is known to be popular in the East, but Seaholm 
said she was self-inspired. She traces the idea to an occasion when she saw a 
bunch of birthday cards in the yard of new parents. 
</P>
<P>
The business appealed to her, she said, because it's something she can do with 
her children -- 6-year-old Stephen, 4-year-old Paul and 2-year-old Kristen. 
</P>
<P>
Her biggest problem so far has been getting the storks to homes far away from 
her Concord base. She has delivered to lawns as far away as Livermore, Benicia 
and Antioch. She had parents in Castro Valley and Pacifica come pick up the 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
None of the storks have been stolen, although one overjoyed parent wanted to 
buy the woodwork. 
</P>
<P>
Seaholm turned down the offer. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you imagine holding this seven-foot stork for all those years and then 
when the kid turns 18 saying, 'Look what I've got for you.' "

BREEDING RARE ANIMALS HELPS TO PRESERVE DIVERSE GENE POOL

FREESTONE, Calif. -- Frazier, the four-horned Navajo-Churro ram, Dusty, the 
curly-haired horse and a flock of skinny turkeys may look wacky, but Hans Peter 
Jorgensen is serious when he says they can help save a world being consumed by 
sameness. 
</P>
<P>
The risks of factory farming -- which produces cheap, easy-to-raise "clone-like 
animals" -- ultimately outweigh the benefits, said the manager of the C. S. 
Foundation farm, which produced the skinny turkeys and the other unusual 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
"(Factory farming) is a short-term gain for a long-term, serious, serious 
loss," Jorgensen said. 
</P>
<P>
"When plants and animals are identical genetically, they have the same 
strengths and weaknesses," said a paper produced by the private, New York 
City-based C. S. Fund. "When one variety suffers destruction, entire plant and 
animal populations can be irretrievably lost; uniformity engenders 
vulnerability." 
</P>
<P>
"Between 1600 and 1900, experts estimate, one plant or animal became extinct 
every four years," the report said. "Today it is estimated that at least one 
species is disappearing each day. By the late 1990s, if current trends 
continue, one species will be lost every hour." 
</P>
<P>
"Extinction is forever; you don't get them back," Jorgensen said. "Our position 
is: Don't throw the genes away, your grandchildren might need them." 
</P>
<P>
The foundation quoted recent studies that show less than 5% of the vegetable 
seed varieties available in the United States in 1903 are still around today, 
and similar reductions in animal gene diversity threaten food and clothing 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
Jorgensen compared the current situation to the Irish potato famine, which 
resulted in the deaths of about 750,000 people from disease or starvation from 
1845 to 1847. That is when the potato crop failed because of a plant blight 
that he said might have been avoided if the Irish had relied on more varieties, 
instead of a limited number that were all susceptible to the disease. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a crisis in genetic diversity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The C. S. Foundation is financed by Maryanne Mott, a Montana rancher, nature 
photographer and General Motors heiress, whose father, Charles Stewart Mott, 
founded the auto giant. The foundation has various causes its directors believe 
promote human and cultural survival: genetic diversity, peace and ecology. 
</P>
<P>
About 15 acres of land in the sleepy Sonoma County town of Freestone, 
population 54, about 65 miles north of San Francisco, were purchased by the 
fund in 1983 when it moved from nearby Santa Rosa. Jorgensen, a former college 
art teacher, cabinet maker, general contractor and son of a Midwestern dairy 
farmer, was hired to run a project to conserve rare or minor breeds. 
</P>
<P>
Rare breeds of cattle and horses are those with less than 200 annual 
registrations; rare sheep, goat and pig breeds have less than 500. Minor breeds 
of cattle, sheep, goats and horses are those with fewer than 1,000 annual 
registrations. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation hopes to carry its conservation message through public education 
and by finding support for genetic diversity preservation. 
</P>
<P>
The fund's first targets have included the Navajo-Churro sheep and 
Bashkir-Curly horse. Recently added to the list was the naturally mating Bronze 
turkey. 
</P>
<P>
The hearty, long-haired Churro sheep has a 450-year history in North America, 
dating to when they were left behind by Spanish conquistadors who had taken the 
animals on their journeys as food. The Navajos began using the Churro -- with 
its long, coarse, double-coated fleece -- for ceremonial rugs. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why the old Navajo rugs would last 200 years," Jorgensen said. 
</P>
<P>
The Churro quickly adapted to dramatic desert climate changes, altitude, 
limited water resources and forage conditions, and Navajo flocks soon numbered 
in the hundreds of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
But poor herding practices, a federal livestock-reduction program that 
Jorgensen said was aimed at humbling the Navajos and saving Lake Mead from 
sheep-caused erosion led to their decimation. 
</P>
<P>
Now near extinction, there are about 500 Churros; about 10% of their rare gene 
pool is in the Freestone flock. A national Navajo-Churro sheep registry was set 
up in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
At Utah State University, Churro Sheep Project spokeswoman Kristy Selman touted 
the animals' ability to resist internal parasites and contagious foot rot, 
problems traditionally expensive for the sheep industry. 
</P>
<P>
Churro lambs sell for $250 to $1,000 and are of great value for the Navajos' 
"Two Gray Hills" style carpets that use the soft but strong black, brown and 
white yarns that require no dyeing, Selman said. 
</P>
<P>
Many older Navajo weavers still cherish the Churro, which the project supplies 
to reservations in Utah, Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a long time since they've seen any of these," she said. "When they 
do, their whole faces light up. . . . When they see it, they want it and they 
want it now." 
</P>
<P>
The success of the foundation's efforts on behalf of the turkey remains to be 
seen. The turkey commonly raised by commercial growers today has been bred for 
white meat, an absence of pin feathers and breast muscles so large the poultry 
cannot mate naturally. Instead, reproduction is handled by artificial 
insemination. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've taken a little step too far," said Jorgensen while gazing at the 
gobbling flock in what he calls the "Turkey Hilton." 
</P>
<P>
The foundation donates its turkey eggs to poultry fanciers or sells them. 
</P>
<P>
The small, sure-footed Bashkir-Curly horse represents one of the foundation's 
mixed successes. Research into the historical origin and genetics of the rare 
North American horses with curly hair showed that the stocky, gentle-natured 
horse who sheds his long, kinky hair every summer was not a separate breed 
after all, but a "very crossed-up bunch." 
</P>
<P>
One goal of the foundation is to have "living history farms" or zoos keep rare 
or endangered breeds of animals because they generally provide more continuity 
than individual breeders. 
</P>
<P>
At the UC Davis agricultural extension office, spokeswoman Heidi Johnson said 
there has been increasing interest in rare breeds of animals. But she chalked 
it up to a "kind of fad thing" that has evolved from a curiosity in exotic 
animals about five years ago.

SANTA CRUZ, Bolivia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The world that Abraham Groening and his Mennonite ancestors fled for 400 years 
has caught up with him. 
</P>
<P>
The once-proud farmer, who is 45 years old and has 13 children, is confined to 
a squalid local prison because of debts to loan sharks. 
</P>
<P>
"I sold off everything I had, but it wasn't enough," he said. "Now I don't even 
own my own bed. And here I am." 
</P>
<P>
A borrower who falls behind on payments can be imprisoned in Bolivia, where the 
law equates incurring bad debts with criminal fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Six brethren share both Groening's predicament and his cellblock. Hundreds of 
others have managed to avoid prison but also were victimized, squeezed after 
borrowing at exorbitant interest rates or guaranteeing the loans of others. 
</P>
<P>
"They couldn't read the fine print," said Menno Ediger, an overseas volunteer 
for the Pennsylvania-based Mennonite Central Committee. "They aren't 
well-educated. They aren't equipped to deal with the outside world." 
</P>
<P>
Such was the case of Groening. "I borrowed $4,000, but the debt grew faster 
than I could pay it back," he said. In two years he owed $40,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Groening has spent six months in the Santa Cruz jail, and has yet to have a 
court hearing. He could receive a sentence of several years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
To keep himself busy, he cuts out wooden puzzles by hand with a jigsaw. 
</P>
<P>
Some of his fellow prisoners already have been jailed for a year or more and 
some have found more worldly ways to pass the time. The gaunt and dazed 
expressions of some of the prisoners signal drug abuse. Use of bazuka, a cheap 
and often contaminated form of cocaine, is common among prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
At the prison, in the tropical brush outside the city, the Mennonites are 
painfully surrounded by the trappings of modern life shunned by their creed. 
</P>
<P>
Rock music blares from portable stereos. Televisions drone in the cellblocks 
and in the fly-infested prison canteen, broadcasting soccer games and soap 
operas. Wall posters warn about the danger of AIDS. There is no prison farm, no 
work programs. 
</P>
<P>
The scandal has darkly clouded life in the 16 Mennonite colonies scattered 
across the sandy, scrub-covered plains outside Santa Cruz, in South America's 
barely tamed Amazonian heartland. 
</P>
<P>
It is inspiring some believers to move on, continuing a migration that dates 
back centuries to the sect's origins. 
</P>
<P>
The Mennonites arose from among Swiss Anabaptists in the 1530s and took their 
name from a Dutch Protestant reformist, Menno Simons. Belief in the Bible, 
adult baptism and non-resistance are fundamental, but within the sect currents 
range from extremely conservative to liberal. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those in Bolivia are so-called Old Colony Mennonites, and resemble the 
Amish that broke away from the main church 200 years ago. They speak a Low 
German dialect, dress simply in overalls or frocks with wide-brimmed straw 
hats, and educate their many children at home. They reject most modern 
technology, making their livings as farmers or craftsmen and riding about in 
horse-drawn buggies. 
</P>
<P>
They try to avoid unnecessary contact with what they call "The World." They are 
prohibited from working outside their colony's borders, and are barred from 
using rubber tires on their tractors -- it might tempt someone to take a ride 
into town. Instead, they use spiked steel wheels unsuitable for pavement. 
</P>
<P>
Over the centuries, their fundamentalism has forced periodic migrations -- to 
Russia, Canada and Mexico, among many other countries. 
</P>
<P>
They began flowing into Bolivia, mostly from Mexico and Belize, in the 1960s. 
About 6,000 to 7,000 came in all. Since then, sporadic new arrivals and births 
have swelled their numbers to about 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
As in previous migrations, they were attracted to Bolivia by cheap land and 
special government exemptions from military service and public schooling. They 
also received an exemption from import duties for farm equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Many were escaping pressure to culturally conform. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always the conservative ones who find the world is getting too close," 
said Ediger, a more liberal Mennonite from Canada. "They came here because they 
wanted to preserve, or get back to, a way of life threatened by the advance of 
technology." 
</P>
<P>
Ediger and his wife, Margaretha, run a modest Santa Cruz cultural center and 
outreach program directed at the colonists. 
</P>
<P>
Ediger is sharply critical of fundamentalism, but confesses a grudging 
admiration for the Old Colony adherents' strength and independence. "You've got 
to hand it to them," he said. "They came here and started from scratch, hacking 
and burning the brush and building their homes." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Gavagan, a Roman Catholic ex-priest from Britain who farms land adjacent to 
a Mennonite colony, called the sect's members "absolutely brilliant" at working 
with their hands. 
</P>
<P>
"They're terribly confident they can go anywhere, even the middle of nowhere, 
and make a life at farming," he said. "And the thing is, they can do it." 
</P>
<P>
The colonists did not arrive in Bolivia empty-handed. Many brought seed money, 
in the form of savings and profits from selling their land in Mexico or 
elsewhere. They imported new tractors, combines and other expensive farm 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
They began quickly turning a profit in the new colonies, first growing cotton 
and, nowadays, mostly soybeans in the sandy soil around Santa Cruz. They 
produce about 70% of the $5 million in soybeans exported by Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
The colonies, with their sturdy brick bungalows, are models of neatness. 
Flaxen-haired children and big farm dogs frolic on the well-tended lawns. 
</P>
<P>
Their affluence attracted attention -- not all of it good. Their stores and 
homes sometimes have been robbed by gunmen who learned that the Mennonites, 
because of their pacifism, don't fight back. 
</P>
<P>
Bankers sought their business, appreciating the colonists' reputation for 
thrift and honesty. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, an economic crisis left most Bolivians with little cash and 
less credit. Lenders aggressively sought the Mennonites, who also were feeling 
the squeeze and, for the first time in Bolivia, were obliged to borrow against 
their crop. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1986, the bankers printed up leaflets that said, 'Mr. Mennonite, Come and 
Borrow From Me,' " Ediger said. "They spread them around the colonies." 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, however, the bankers did not lend the money themselves. They 
steered the naive Mennonites to friends who ran shady loan agencies that 
offered U.S. dollars at usurious rates -- up to 5% or more a month. 
</P>
<P>
Ediger estimates that at least 300 Mennonites were fleeced in the scheme. In 
many cases, the colonies are having to use common money, normally saved for 
buying land, to pay off the debts. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the imprisoned Mennonites get visits from relatives, who must travel 
for hours by bus on dusty roads from the colonies. But others have fallen into 
disgrace, and even their wives and children now shun them. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't come here anymore," Enrique Jiesprecht Boll, 43, said of his wife 
and five children. "Other people are telling them not to come." 
</P>
<P>
He has been in the prison 16 months, and has yet to receive a sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the prisoners even have been banned, a form of excommunication in which 
close contact even with immediate family members is prohibited. Among those 
banned was a debtor who became a trusty, driving the prison truck to town on 
errands. The fundamentalists' code prohibits driving automobiles and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
There are colonists who feel the jailed Mennonites were victims of their own 
greed or sloth. "Some weren't workers," said Franz Rempel, a 39-year-old 
cabinetmaker in a colony called Swift Current, southeast of Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
"When you take out a loan, you have to work to pay it back. Some didn't know 
how to do that." 
</P>
<P>
According to colonists, the borrowers were naively trying to repeat the profits 
that could be made by borrowing pesos in the early 1980s, when devaluation 
outpaced interest rates. With inflation running at five digits, a loan in pesos 
equivalent to $1,000 in 1983 could be paid back a year later with the 
equivalent of just $75. A government austerity program put an end to high 
inflation, and the accompanying financial speculation, in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Margaretha Ediger maintains, however, that the indebted Mennonites have more 
than paid for any sins. "Their crimes are nothing compared to the crimes of 
those (the lenders) who are keeping them in prison," she said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the inmates, 28-year-old Abraham Friesen, only days away from his 
scheduled release after 18 months in prison, said he planned to emigrate with 
his wife and six children. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to go to another country, maybe Canada," he said. "I had to sell 
everything. There's nothing left for me here."

AUSTRALIA INVESTIGATES CHARGES OF POLICE CORRUPTION

<P>
Detective Sgt. Michael Drury was feeding his child when two gunshots tore 
through the kitchen window and into his stomach and shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Drury, an undercover agent of the New South Wales police, the largest force in 
Australia, survived. The bullet missed his heart after deflecting off a curtain 
rod. 
</P>
<P>
Five years later, questions about the shooting remain unanswered amid 
allegations of police corruption, treachery and deception. 
</P>
<P>
"A public inquiry into New South Wales police could make the Queensland inquiry 
look like small beer," said a police source who declined to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
The police force in neighboring Queensland is "riddled with misconduct, 
inefficiency and a contempt for the criminal justice system," according to an 
official inquiry report released a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Queensland's former police chief, Terence Lewis, and 19 other officers and 
detectives face 94 charges arising out of the yearlong inquiry, the most 
extensive Australia has seen. 
</P>
<P>
New South Wales is Australia's most populous state, with more than a quarter of 
the nation's 16 million people. It has a 12,500-member police force. 
</P>
<P>
In November, New South Wales Premier Nick Greiner, vowing to ensure that the 
"forces of evil do not take charge," appointed a special investigator to look 
into the Drury case. 
</P>
<P>
The investigator, Howard Purnell, will conduct his inquiry behind closed doors 
and report at the end of March on alleged police cover-ups and bungling in the 
Drury affair. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to ensure the average person has confidence in the integrity of the 
police force and the other arms of justice," Greiner said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some very big battles being fought behind the scenes between honest 
police and those who would seek to destroy them," state police minister Ted 
Pickering told parliament recently. 
</P>
<P>
An official commission is scrutinizing another case in which police detective 
superintendent Harry Blackburn was arrested on charges of raping and kidnaping 
in suburban Sydney over a period of 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Police dropped all charges after it was revealed in court that they had failed 
to compare Blackburn's blood type with that of the rapist. The blood types were 
found to be different. 
</P>
<P>
Director of Public Prosecutions Reg Blanch conceded before the commission that 
police investigations over the Blackburn affair had been "incompetent, stupid 
or dishonest." 
</P>
<P>
Opposition members of Parliament demanded the Blackburn inquiry be given 
extended powers to investigate the Drury shooting and the possible underworld 
links of corrupt police. 
</P>
<P>
Drury, 36, in a statement immediately after the shooting, accused Detective 
Sgt. Roger Rogerson of trying to buy his silence after Drury helped to break up 
a major heroin ring. 
</P>
<P>
Later in court, Drury alleged Rogerson had offered him bribes to stop Drury 
from identifying drug dealer Allen Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was arrested and pleaded guilty to conspiring to kill Drury. Williams 
told the court he offered $78,000 to Christopher Flannery, known in the 
underworld as "Mr. Rent-a-Kill," to kill Drury. 
</P>
<P>
Flannery has been missing, presumed dead, since May, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, now serving a 14-year jail sentence, also implicated Rogerson, whom 
he said had dealings with Flannery. Rogerson denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Supreme Court acquitted Rogerson of conspiring to murder Drury. He 
was also cleared of a charge of attempting to bribe Drury. 
</P>
<P>
Rogerson, who was fired from the New South Wales police force, still faces two 
charges of conspiring to pervert the course of justice. His trial is scheduled 
for January. 
</P>
<P>
The New South Wales government ordered the special investigation into the Drury 
shooting after the Daily Telegraph severely criticized the original police 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also reported that former police commissioner Cec Abbott had 
appointed a senior officer to conduct the investigations, knowing that he was a 
friend of Rogerson. 
</P>
<P>
But New South Wales police commissioner John Avery maintains that most of his 
force is honest. 
</P>
<P>
"The great majority of police are working very effectively and fully support 
the aims and objectives of the police service," he said.

BHARATPUR, India 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fewer Siberian cranes are migrating to their favorite wintering ground in the 
marshes of western India, and some bird watchers fear that they are being shot 
down over Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
Only 17 cranes arrived this winter in the Keoladeo National Park at Bharatpur, 
once a duck-shooting preserve of maharajahs and now a sanctuary for more than 
400 bird species. 
</P>
<P>
The small number cannot be "taken lightly" because 24 cranes came in the winter 
of 1988-89 and 31 the winter before that, said V.S. Vijayan, a scientist with 
the Bombay Natural History Society who has been working at Bharatpur. 
</P>
<P>
Indian wildlife officials and environmentalists agree with Jim Harris, an 
ornithologist with the International Crane Foundation based in Baraboo, Wis., 
that the birds may be falling victim to gunners in Afghanistan's war. 
</P>
<P>
A Soviet scientist rejected that theory, and other Indian officials said 
recurring drought in Bharatpur may be contributing to the declining number of 
arrivals at the sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
The group gathered recently to discuss the cranes at the Bombay Natural History 
Society office in Bharatpur. 
</P>
<P>
Ornithologists know little about the red-beaked white birds that fly more than 
3,100 miles in about one month from their breeding ground in the tundras of 
western Siberia to Bharatpur in Rajasthan state in western India. 
</P>
<P>
A smaller flock migrates to Iran. The two flocks, perhaps totaling fewer than 
50 birds, leave the Ob River valley in Soviet Siberia in September or October, 
just as it is starts snowing. They return in late February or early March. 
</P>
<P>
The India-bound flock probably makes only two stopovers -- in Soviet Kazakhstan 
and in Afghanistan, according to Vladimir Flint, head of the Soviet Union's 
Animal Protection Department at the All-Union Research Institute of Nature 
Conservation and Reserves in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
No precise estimates are available of the number of western Siberian cranes. 
Harris put the figure at fewer than 50, but other estimates place it as high as 
200. 
</P>
<P>
"There is very little data about the birds," Flint said during the session. "We 
hardly know anything about them except that they fly over Iran and Afghanistan 
to the marshes here." 
</P>
<P>
Said Harris: "And there are a lot of people with guns in Afghanistan who are 
waiting to pull the trigger." 
</P>
<P>
Since the birds are safe from humans in the inaccessible Siberian tundras and 
in the sanctuary at Bharatpur, Harris added, it is likely that they are being 
killed during migration. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not agree that the birds are being killed over Afghanistan," said Flint. 
"Our next goal is to know the whole migration route and the dangers they face." 
</P>
<P>
Prakash Gole, head of the Ecological Society based in Poona, India, agreed with 
Harris that Siberian cranes may have been killed in Afghanistan. He said other 
kinds of cranes were shot and sold for meat in Afghanistan even before the war 
between the Soviet-backed government and U.S.-supported Muslim guerrillas 
started in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Harris also said a dead Siberian crane turned up last year at a local meat 
market in Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
The freshwater wasteland at Bharatpur, about 30 miles west of the Taj Mahal in 
Agra, was declared a shooting preserve for local maharajahs and British 
colonial rulers in 1902. 
</P>
<P>
Bird shooting was outlawed here in 1972, and the marsh was declared a national 
park in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The park's director, K.L. Saini, said in an interview later that the 
Afghanistan theory is "an interesting one." 
</P>
<P>
"But it is highly likely that the frequent droughts in the area may be the main 
reason for their decreasing number," he added. "Until about eight years ago, we 
used to have regular floods which kept the marsh alive and produced enough food 
for the birds." 
</P>
<P>
Another group of cranes, apparently no different from the western Siberian 
crane, breeds in eastern Siberia and migrates to China in winter. The eastern 
Siberian cranes are believed to number at least 1,400. Like the western cranes, 
they are considered endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
Flint said the Soviets have initiated studies to genetically compare the two 
species, "but my guess is there will be no difference." 
</P>
<P>
The declining crane migration is also worrying naturalists who earn their 
living by conducting tours of the sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone comes to Bharatpur to see the Siberian cranes," said Udai Singh, who 
conducts tours. "And when they stop coming here, even the tourists will stop, 
and I guess we will have to close shop." 
</P>
<P>
Singh's one-day tours cost $100 for a Western tour group and $7.35 each for 
Indian groups.

AGRICULTURE DEPT.'S OPEN CAMPUS OFFERS LOW-COST ADULT CLASSES

There are no ivy-covered walls or homecoming dances at a popular but largely 
invisible college the Department of Agriculture has been running quietly here 
for nearly 70 years. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the big jokes I've heard is that our football team has never lost a 
game," joked Dr. Philip Hudson, director of the USDA Graduate School, the only 
U.S. government educational institution of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
The longstanding affiliation with the Agriculture Department could be 
misleading. You won't find classes filled with farmers in bib overalls studying 
how to raise prize-winning squashes or build a state-of-the-art tool shed. The 
Graduate School offers low-cost instruction in 1,000 courses, ranging from 
computer sciences to bird-watching, to anyone 18 or older who walks in the 
door. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the 40,000 students are federal bureaucrats seeking to upgrade their 
skills so they can qualify for promotions, but the school also attracts a fair 
share of Washington suburbanites in pursuit of avocations. 
</P>
<P>
The school was established in 1921 by a former secretary of agriculture, Henry 
C. Wallace, for the purpose of after-hours graduate training of department's 
research scientists, many of whom had been leaving for better-paying jobs in 
private industry. 
</P>
<P>
Since 176 students showed up for the first day of classes in science, economics 
and statistics on Oct. 17, 1921, in the Agriculture Department building on the 
Mall, the Graduate School has produced a million or so alumni. 
</P>
<P>
Although most have been anonymous toilers in the bureaucracy, one of the most 
famous among them is Supreme Court Justice Byron R. White. 
</P>
<P>
As a young Navy officer on temporary duty in Washington in 1945, White got his 
first exposure to the legal profession from a Graduate School course in 
administrative law. He later entered Yale Law School. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1960s, when White was a deputy attorney general in the John F. 
Kennedy Administration, he returned to the Graduate School for a "reading 
improvement" course. He recalled that it was "quite good" and urged his Justice 
Department colleagues to enroll. 
</P>
<P>
The school's international division provided training in public administration 
for officials from the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) when that African country 
became independent in 1960. Next April, courtesy of the U.S. Information 
Agency, a dozen judges from the Soviet Union will take courses on the American 
legal system at the Graduate School. 
</P>
<P>
The curriculum has something for nearly every taste. It is heavy on advanced 
technical courses but also offers exotic choices such as introductory Swahili, 
the German novella, mushroom cultivation and assertiveness training for both 
men and women. 
</P>
<P>
Instruction is offered in daytime seminars, correspondence courses and evening 
and weekend sessions in rented classroom space around the city. Lectures are 
given in scattered government buildings, at local high schools, in a private 
office building, the National Arboretum and the National Audubon Society's 
wooded estate in suburban Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
The faculty consists of 700 part-time teachers, many of them retired government 
officials, private professionals and professors from local colleges and 
universities. Two-thirds of the students already have bachelor's degrees or 
better, but there are no minimum education requirements for enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
The Graduate School is a nonprofit, $10-million-a-year enterprise that doesn't 
receive a penny of public funds. It is supported entirely by tuition fees, 
which average $150 for the equivalent of a two-credit college course. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bargain," says Hudson, 47, who has been director since 1985. "In a 
sense, we have to have the heart and soul of a public servant and the reflexes 
of an entrepreneur to keep it afloat." 
</P>
<P>
Although the school doesn't grant degrees, credits earned in 275 of its 1,000 
courses have been recommended by the American Council on Education for transfer 
to regularly accredited colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
Hudson said the Graduate School probably will never have an ivy-walled campus 
of its own, and for good reason. 
</P>
<P>
"We very much want to operate as a college without walls, and to be out there 
where the customers live and work," he said.

DUTCH DRUG POLICY GAINS GROUND; 
</P>
<P>
NARCOTICS: LONG VIEWED AS MECCA FOR USERS, NETHERLANDS' APPROACH IS GETTING A 
CLOSER LOOK FROM OTHER COUNTRIES.

<P>
For years, the Netherlands was viewed abroad as a mecca for hashish and heroin 
users, but Dutch officialdom now says its approach to drug abuse is gaining 
some ground in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
The country has far fewer drug-related AIDS cases than other European countries 
and signs are that young people are steering away from the drug scene. 
</P>
<P>
"Our approach of helping even addicts who don't want to kick the habit was 
scorned," said Eddy Engelsman, head of the Health Ministry's drug, alcohol and 
tobacco department. "We were entirely alone." 
</P>
<P>
The Dutch now say that other nations are beginning to accept their view that it 
is better to successfully contain drug abuse than to try to stamp it out 
completely. 
</P>
<P>
The Dutch policy of allowing open sales of hashish and marijuana came under 
fire in other countries as examples of free-for-all permissiveness and 
admitting defeat in the war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called "soft drugs" are readily available at hundreds of coffee shops 
throughout the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
The possession of up to 30 grams (1.2 ounces) is a misdemeanor punishable by a 
250-guilder ($138) fine, but the law is rarely, if ever, enforced. And while 
possession of "hard drugs" remains a crime punishable by a 12-year prison 
sentence, heroin and cocaine dealers do business out in the open in some parts 
of Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>
But the nation has little drug-related violence and none of the gang warfare 
that has accompanied the illicit drug traffic elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Dutch health authorities were among the first in Europe to experiment with free 
methadone handouts and hypodermic needles for heroin addicts, arguing that drug 
users should be seen as patients and not as criminals. 
</P>
<P>
"The point isn't getting them to kick the habit, but to get them to see a 
doctor daily," Engelsman said in an interview. "If you push them underground . 
. . that's how they end up on the margins of society." 
</P>
<P>
Officials maintain that those programs, by discouraging the re-use of needles 
by addicts, have helped keep AIDS at much lower levels here than elsewhere in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
As of Dec. 1, only 7% of the 1,044 Dutch people with AIDS were known 
intravenous drug users, contrasted with 25% in most European countries, 
Engelsman said. 
</P>
<P>
The average age of Amsterdam's estimated 7,000 heroin addicts has been rising 
steadily in recent years, a sign that relatively few young people are beginning 
the heroin habit, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The Dutch stance of acceptance and containment derives at least in part from 
the societal view that personal practices should be beyond legal sanctions, so 
long as they don't affect others. 
</P>
<P>
At the other extreme, U.S. drug policy coordinator William J. Bennett adamantly 
opposes any move toward decriminalization, which he has called "stupid and 
morally atrocious." 
</P>
<P>
West Germany has expressed concern that the opening of borders of the nations 
of the European Economic Community in 1992 will lead to a flood of drugs from 
the Netherlands and put strong pressure on the Dutch government to tighten up 
its drug laws. 
</P>
<P>
But in July, the city of Hamburg in West Germany announced that it would 
propose a nationwide law opening the way for free heroin handouts under 
strictly controlled circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Hamburg City Hall spokesman Henning Fock said in a telephone interview that the 
plan was based in part on Dutch experiences with the distribution of methadone, 
a heroin substitute. 
</P>
<P>
"The Netherlands is regarded with envy," he said. "The Dutch are certainly very 
advanced in the way they're prepared to discuss drug taboos." Although the 
Hamburg plan was later trimmed to include only an extension of existing 
methadone programs, Engelsman noted that it was bolder than anything ever 
proposed in the Netherlands, where similar free heroin plans have rarely gone 
beyond the thinking stage. 
</P>
<P>
In January, a report by the U.S. Embassy in The Hague noted that Dutch policy 
"is often mistranslated and misinterpreted as 'indulgent' or 'permissive.' In 
fact, in this society it operates as a powerful social control." 
</P>
<P>
The report concluded, "Certain of the mechanics such as low-threshold therapy, 
mobile treatment units and needle exchange might well be adaptable to the 
American reality." 
</P>
<P>
Drug policy in many nations "is getting far more pragmatic . . . that's the 
pressure we've been exerting," said Engelsman. 
</P>
<P>
That was shown in recent Dutch negotiations with West Germany, France, Belgium 
and Luxembourg over a plan to open borders among the five nations even before 
the European single market in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, known as the Schengen agreement, has been shelved until later this 
year because of the sudden crumbling of the Iron Curtain between the two 
Germanys. 
</P>
<P>
However, Dutch negotiators secured guarantees from the four other nations that 
the Netherlands will be able to pursue its own drug policy so long as it takes 
measures to prevent the liberal Dutch climate from attracting large numbers of 
foreign drug users. 
</P>
<P>
"If there are any coffee bars that only sell (hashish or marijuana) to West 
German youngsters, we'll have to do something about that," Engelsman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, our biggest priority remains detecting imports and exports, and 
there've been no complaints about that at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want a 'war on drugs.' We don't like that terminology because we're 
convinced it doesn't work."

TEXAS BAR SEEKS KINDER, GENTLER LAWYERS

<P>
Lawyers and judges concede that their profession probably will not set any 
standards for social graces, but they are giving good manners a shot 
nevertheless. 
</P>
<P>
A new Lawyer's Creed -- the first such statewide code in the nation -- was 
recently approved by the Texas Supreme Court and the Texas Court of Criminal 
Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
It asks the state's 52,000 lawyers for kinder litigation. 
</P>
<P>
No more obnoxiousness. No more tit-for-tat unprofessional behavior. No more 
stalling tactics. And no "allusions to personal peculiarities or idiosyncrasies 
of opposing counsel" will be allowed, according to the creed. Lawyers and 
judges say the let's-be-civil creed is overdue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like dieting," Texas Supreme Court Justice Eugene Cook said. 
"It's a battle that we can win, but it's not going to be done overnight." 
</P>
<P>
Cook said the creed was initiated by Dallas and Houston legal associations to 
fight bad behavior and needlessly aggressive courtroom tactics. 
</P>
<P>
The offending behavior -- including rudeness, engaging in lengthy procedural 
delays, even resorting to fistfights -- has been clogging court schedules and 
hampering disposition of cases. 
</P>
<P>
Cook said some lawyers try to reschedule proceedings on dates most likely to 
bother an opponent. 
</P>
<P>
"If they know of a time that will be inconvenient -- say the day your wife is 
having a baby or the week you've been planning all year for a vacation -- 
that's when they'll schedule it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people think that it's the way to practice law, to be rude and abusive 
and try to intimidate the other side." 
</P>
<P>
He said the problems have become increasingly common in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge A. Joe Fish said that part of the problem may be the 
increase in lawyers in the state's largest cities. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Rambo tactics arise out of the feeling that 'I'm never going to 
see the other lawyer again,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas Bar Assn. President Al Ellis said financial woes also have increased 
courtroom problems. 
</P>
<P>
"As the law firms have gotten bigger and the economy has gone down, there's 
been a lot of pressure on younger and middle-management lawyers to produce, and 
some have responded with this kind of behavior," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 34-part Lawyer's Creed, developed by a committee with representatives from 
18 legal associations, relies on voluntary compliance and includes no specific 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
The creed includes requirements of civility toward peers and judges and a ban 
on "antagonistic or obnoxious behavior." 
</P>
<P>
"Some judges have copies of the creed pasted to their courthouse doors," Cook 
said. "They tell the lawyers (to) go outside and read it and don't come back in 
until they learn how to act accordingly."

Alan Kiepper wanted to start off his first day as president of the Transit 
Authority on the right foot. Instead, he started it on the wrong train. 
</P>
<P>
The new subway chief got lost on the F line and ended up in Queens last week 
instead of the TA's headquarters in Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
But Kiepper, 10 minutes late for a staff meeting, showed his managerial sense 
of direction by launching a review of train- and station-cleaning standards and 
asking his staff to brainstorm on how to speed up a station-restoration 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Subway Map Reading 101 might be useful. 
</P>
<P>
Before boarding the wrong train in Manhattan, Kiepper took time to stop and 
give directions to a man looking for the No. 6 train. 
</P>
<P>
"I found out later I gave him the wrong directions," Kiepper said.

REAL ESTATE: COASTAL RESIDENTS WHO SEE THEIR HOMES SLIPPING OUT FROM UNDER THEM

<P>
When escrow closed in December, 1988, Wilbur Bootsma and Rick Allmain thought 
they had brokered a piece of the palm-laden California dream: a Leucadia home 
perched intimately on a bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Ninety feet above the crashing surf, they could gaze across the seemingly 
endless ocean expanse or walk down a private stairway to the beach below. 
</P>
<P>
Then, less than a month after the pair moved in, the dream literally began to 
crumble beneath their feet. 
</P>
<P>
The crashing waves, which often battered the shore like cannon blasts, and the 
underwater streams that honeycombed the sandstone below have combined to eat 
away large chunks of five hilltop properties in the coastal neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Living in the Neptune Avenue home during the past year, Allmain said, was like 
sleeping on a fault line. Often the house would moan and shudder as the ground 
shifted beneath it. 
</P>
<P>
Bathroom towel racks tore away from the walls. Plates slid from tables. By 
October, after the third major ground failure in less than 10 months, whole 
sections of their private stairway to the beach had collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
The home, which once sat more than 10 feet from the edge of the bluff, hung 
precariously over a newly formed precipice, prompting city officials in 
Encinitas to declare both the property and the one next door a safety hazard. 
</P>
<P>
In more than a decade on the job, one state Coastal Commission planner recently 
said, he has never seen a house come so close to toppling into the sea. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, in a frantic effort to save their investment, the five property 
owners began building a seawall -- before seeking permits -- to shore up the 
unstable bluff. Months later, after another major ground failure that damaged 
the fledgling project, the neighbors received the necessary emergency permit 
from the Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The commission recently granted homeowners a permanent permit for the 
90-foot-high structure, which officials say is the biggest of its kind in 
Encinitas, on the condition that the project also meet city environmental and 
construction standards. 
</P>
<P>
Now the nervous property owners are awaiting the results of the city's permit 
process -- which includes a public hearing as well as geological and 
environmental surveys -- dreading a decision that would force them to tear down 
their seawall, once again exposing their homes to the ocean's whims. 
</P>
<P>
For hundreds of North County coastal dwellers, the incident illustrates life on 
the edge, the daily gamble that their storybook life style on the doorstep of 
the sea will not suddenly bring about some violent and expensive consequences. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, property owners up and down the fragile coast have built 
makeshift seawalls -- from piles of boulders and odd-looking wood contraptions 
to the fortress-like steel and concrete wall on Neptune Avenue -- all in the 
hopes of shielding their homes from the restless and ruthless force of the 
Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Those efforts have escalated as the beaches that once served as a natural 
buffer between the cliffs and the sea have been stripped of sand. In many areas 
where the swells at one time crashed harmlessly hundreds of feet from the 
bluffs, the ocean now batters the land daily. 
</P>
<P>
The pounding has undermined not only the foundation of the bluffs themselves, 
but also the properties that sit on top of them -- often palatial homes that 
range anywhere in price from $850,000 to $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a Catch-22," said Encinitas Planning Director Craig Jones. "You're 
talking about big investments here for some of the most highly coveted property 
in all of Southern California. But these properties are also fragile, subject 
to the constraints of natural conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"The contrast makes for some very emotional issues with homeowners. And it puts 
cities like us in a weird position, because no matter how much money was paid 
for these very fragile properties, we have a legal obligation to protect the 
public health and safety." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the homes and condominiums atop the cliffs in North County were built 
from 1947 to 1977, a period marked by mostly benign storms and little erosion 
along the coast. Lulled into a false sense of security, developers hammered 
together homes near the edge of the bluffs, figuring they had a stable platform 
that would stand the test of time. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, however, coastal experts have come to believe that bluff 
erosion poses a profound threat to the high-priced homes stretching along the 
seaboard. During periods of heavy storms and high wave activity, they have seen 
undeveloped sections of bluff that eroded hundreds of feet inland in just a few 
days. 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1970s, residences perched along the cliffs in Solana Beach, just 
south of Encinitas, were threatened by major ground failures. The immediate 
erosion was stemmed by concrete seawalls that now line much of the coast in the 
tiny community. 
</P>
<P>
But the seawalls provide only a temporary solution, experts say. The flat-faced 
concrete also tends to heighten wave action and turbulence, increasing the 
chances that sand will be stripped from the beach. That can increase the 
scouring effect on adjacent, unprotected bluffs. 
</P>
<P>
This month, the Coastal Commission will use a videotape recorded by a private 
resident in a study to determine exactly how many seawalls exist along the 
Encinitas shores and how they might be furthering coastal decay. 
</P>
<P>
"One of our tasks will be to put together a comprehensive history of shoreline 
erosion there, to see how seawalls contributed to that decay," coastal planner 
Paul Webb said. "By matching permits to what we actually find built on the 
coast, we also want to determine how many of those seawalls were constructed 
illegally." 
</P>
<P>
The fickle Encinitas coastline that prompted the study, planners say, has posed 
some disturbing surprises for homeowners who choose to brave such a life style. 
As Wilbur Bootsma and Rick Allmain discovered, the bluffs are kind to some, 
almost deadly to others. 
</P>
<P>
Although properties on their block steadily fell away into the chilly Pacific, 
homes a short distance north and south of them stood as solid as the rock of 
Gibraltar. 
</P>
<P>
In California, the coastal gamble contains another very serious element, 
planners say: earthquakes such as the one that shook most of Southern 
California last week could literally push some homeowners over the edge. 
</P>
<P>
With the potential for such disaster, regulatory agencies such as the Coastal 
Commission have firmed up development requirements, prohibiting new homes 
within 40 feet of the cliff edges. 
</P>
<P>
But, in particularly troubled spots such as Encinitas, more needs to be done, 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"They need to develop a pro-active plan to protect against bluff erosion along 
their entire coastline," Webb said. "They can't get the job done by dealing 
with the problem on a narrow, case-by-case basis." 
</P>
<P>
Encinitas homeowners say they're up to the task. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, after the city last summer considered a beach protection ordinance 
that would have placed added constraints on bluff-top development, several 
groups of seaside homeowners formed a committee to discuss ways to stem the 
erosion. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Marvin, a member of the Seacoast Preservation Assn., which represents 
about 120 bluff-top homeowners in Encinitas, said the committee is also 
considering issues such as simplifying the emergency permit process for a 
seawall in the case of a bluff failure and allowing homeowners to rebuild if 
their homes collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the solution, homeowners say, lies in bringing sand back to the beach. 
Much of the southerly flow of sand along North County beaches has been cut off 
by the damming of rivers that once ran to the sea and the creation of a 
man-made harbor in Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners hope the sand will eventually come from several planned projects to 
suck it from the floor of Oceanside harbor and Batiquitos Lagoon and deposit it 
back where it belongs, Marvin said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, sand seems to be the only long-term way to save the fragile North 
County bluffs. 
</P>
<P>
"The beaches in Encinitas used to be wide and beautiful, and they protected the 
bluffs," Marvin said. "But more than 10 feet of beach has been lost from the 
beaches over the past 20 years. And that's too much." 
</P>
<P>
Some local officials, meanwhile, maintain that many of the bluff-top homes 
never should have been built. They can't understand why people persist in 
staying in them once disaster has struck. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Weedman, an Encinitas city planner, said he gained a valuable insight into 
the gamble while walking with a city-contracted geologist along the bluffs near 
Neptune Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him if he'd ever own a house on the bluffs, and he said, 'No way,' and 
he didn't know why anyone would," Weedman said. "He said he'd buy on the other 
side of the street. That way he'd still be close enough to the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"And, with a second-story house, he might even have about the same view as the 
people perched on the bluffs." 
</P>
<P>
When they moved into the house at 710 Neptune Ave., Wilbur Bootsma and Rick 
Allmain bought more than an intimate ocean view. They bought what friends call 
the worst year of their lives -- literally waiting for their home to teeter off 
its perch and into the surf. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, Allmain said, Neptune Avenue neighbors were told it would take 
months to receive an emergency permit to build a wall to steady the crumbling 
bluff. So they started building without one. 
</P>
<P>
After part of the under-construction wall collapsed during a major ground shift 
in April, an emergency building permit was issued by Coastal Commission 
officials, who now say the seawall may well have contributed to the continued 
rapid demise of the bluff. 
</P>
<P>
Allmain doesn't buy that argument. 
</P>
<P>
"We were so frustrated because we had no cooperation whatsoever from the city 
or the Coastal Commission," he said. "We either had to build the wall or watch 
our home collapse." 
</P>
<P>
And, until the property can be shored up, selling the home is out of the 
question. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have a home in that kind of peril, there's no way to market it," 
Allmain said. "The place is totally worthless until we can put it back together 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Some Encinitas city officials say the bluff-top gamblers will have to play the 
hand nature deals them. 
</P>
<P>
"At some point in time, as those bluffs peel away, people are going to have to 
realize that some properties are just too fragile to build upon," said 
Encinitas City Councilwoman Marjorie Gaines. 
</P>
<P>
"But some people are just willing to take the risk. They're willing to gamble 
with the ocean, which is a very powerful thing. And you can't predict when that 
power will come to hurt you." 
</P>

ORGAN TRANSPLANT PROGRAMS ARE ON THE RISE IN SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Vicki Lamberton doesn't need prompting to remember the date on which a Denver 
doctor diagnosed a rare medical condition that eventually placed her fate in 
the hands of UC San Diego Medical Center, and a team of specialists that hopes 
to save her life with a heart-lung transplant. 
</P>
<P>
"Feb. 20, 1986. Two, 20, 86," said Lamberton, a 35-year-old Denver resident who 
since has entered the date on countless hospital forms. But Lamberton, the 
mother of two young boys, is awaiting an even more important date: the day when 
a heart-lung donor makes her transplant -- the first such operation in San 
Diego County -- possible. 
</P>
<P>
"Waiting has always been the problem," said Dr. Stuart Jamieson, who heads the 
UCSD transplant team that will perform Lamberton's operation. Waiting is "a 
very risky thing to do, but in these cases there is no alternative." 
</P>
<P>
Lamberton, her husband, Vincent, and their two sons are now living at a 
relative's house in Moorpark. "We had a choice of moving straight to San Diego 
or coming here to live with my sister and arrange for air transportation," 
Lamberton said. 
</P>
<P>
She is one of a growing number of people awaiting transplants in San Diego. But 
the lengthening list is not the result of more people getting sick. Rather, San 
Diego is undergoing a boom in the number of transplant programs at area 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD, Sharp Memorial Hospital and Scripps Clinic have recently announced or 
opened new transplant programs or expanded services provided by existing 
programs. Those hospitals plan to eventually add new heart, heart-lung, kidney, 
liver and pancreas transplant programs. Mercy Hospital has placed a proposed 
heart transplant program on hold until a chief surgeon is located. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp and UCSD now have a total of nine patients on their heart transplant 
lists. They have three patients awaiting heart-lung transplants and three 
awaiting single lung transplants. UCSD also has 120 patients awaiting kidney 
transplants. 
</P>
<P>
There are no liver transplant programs in San Diego, although several hospitals 
are now contemplating them. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics have argued that the highly specialized and expensive transplant 
units -- a relatively straightforward heart transplant can cost $100,000 or 
more -- will needlessly boost local health care costs by duplicating services 
available elsewhere. The critics maintain that San Diego's hospitals, in an era 
marked by skyrocketing health costs, should dedicate scarce capital to other, 
more pressing needs. 
</P>
<P>
Questions have also been raised about whether the new programs can match the 
success rates of the more established surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital administrators in the past have given a variety of reasons for the 
addition of expensive transplant programs. Most claim the programs allow them 
to better serve their patients' overall health needs. Others have acknowledged 
that the programs give hospitals a certain status and greater ability to 
attract top-notch doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Competition among local hospitals that perform major organ transplants moved 
into a new phase last weekend when UCSD became the second local hospital to 
perform a heart transplant. Sharp has been transplanting hearts since 1985. 
UCSD surgeons previously did the transplants through a program based at Sharp. 
</P>
<P>
Jamieson said that at UCSD, the expanding transplant program plays an integral 
part in the hospital's role as a teaching institution. The program "fits in 
with our reputation for handling difficult cases," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the heart transplants are a small part of the total work 
performed by him and other members of the team. During the past week, for 
example, Jamieson performed the heart transplant as well as several open-heart 
surgeries that included a major operation on Roger Revelle, the noted scientist 
and co-founder of UCSD. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ron Adamson, co-director of Sharp's transplant program, suggested that 
patients will be better served as the number of transplant centers increases, 
because physicians must spend a hefty amount of time with patients who need 
time-consuming postoperative care. 
</P>
<P>
Health care officials defend the increase in transplant programs by saying that 
San Diego is merely catching up with the growth of such programs elsewhere in 
the country. "San Diego is the sixth-biggest city in the U.S., and most cities 
of its size already have two heart transplant programs," Jamieson said. "Boston 
and Kansas City each have four." 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego is actually one of the last major metropolitan areas to undergo this 
kind of growth," said James A. Cutler, recently named executive director of the 
Organ and Tissue Acquisition Center in San Diego, which is charged with 
locating and transporting donated organs and tissue in San Diego and Imperial 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
Local transplant programs may make the expensive operations available to "the 
majority of people who probably can't afford to manage moving out of town to be 
near a hospital," Cutler said. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, health insurance rules and a patient's doctor determine where 
transplants are done. Local hospitals accept patients from around the country, 
and San Diegans are not restricted to programs at local hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD's first heart transplant represented a major step in its planned expansion 
of its existing program, which had been limited to kidneys. Like many 
hospitals, UCSD also transplants corneas, bone and skin tissue. It also 
conducts skin grafts and, several years ago, made an ill-fated attempt to 
perform liver transplants. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD's heart transplant patient, Gary Troxel, a 25-year-old construction worker 
from Riverside County, is "well ahead of schedule" in his recovery, Jamieson 
said late last week. Jamieson moved his transplant team "lock, stock and 
barrel" from the University of Minnesota. In that program, 93% of the patients 
have lived at least three years after their transplants. 
</P>
<P>
Jamieson, who completed his first heart transplant on July 4, 1979, described 
the operation as "pretty routine . . . but it was strange to be doing this 
operation in an environment (UCSD) where one had not been done before." 
</P>
<P>
The flurry of media activity that accompanied the UCSD transplant contrasts 
with the scene at Sharp, where doctors last week completed their 70th heart 
transplant. 
</P>
<P>
"We no longer hear from the press each time we do an operation," said Adamson. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp's heart transplant program has a survival rate beyond the national 
averages, he said. No one has died on the operating table, he said, and 'we 
have . . . a 97% one-year survival rate and an 80% survival rate 4 1/2 years 
later." 
</P>
<P>
While heart transplants today are viewed as a relatively common form of 
therapy, Jamieson and Adamson noted that the next frontier in San Diego -- the 
heart-lung combination -- is a more difficult procedure. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still a very specialized operation," said Jamieson, who performed his 
first heart-lung transplant in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"Survival rates are not as good as heart (transplants), but we're getting 
better all the time," Adamson said. 
</P>
<P>
In a strategic move last fall designed to bolster its transplant prowess, Sharp 
announced a joint venture with Scripps Clinic &amp; Research Foundation. The 
two hospitals have agreed to work together to improve Sharp's heart-lung and 
lung transplant capability. In December, Sharp identified its first candidate 
for a heart-lung transplant, Adamson said. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital is in "final negotiations" with a surgeon who will conduct kidney 
transplants, he said. That would place Sharp in competition with UCSD. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp's agreement with Scripps also calls for the development of a liver 
transplant program at Scripps' Green Hospital. Both Sharp and UCSD abandoned 
liver transplant programs several years ago after running into difficulties. 
The UCSD liver program is "on hold," according to a UCSD spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from experience, getting a new program on track in San Diego can be 
difficult. Mercy, for example, recently put its heart transplant program on 
hold after its newly hired director encountered contractual problems with his 
previous employer. Last year, a proposed heart and lung transplant program at 
Scripps Clinic suffered a setback when federal administrators determined that 
the surgeon hired to do the operations lacked the proper credentials. 
</P>
<P>
It can also take time for a program to mature. Sharp initially announced its 
intention to create a heart-lung transplant program in 1988, but is still 
awaiting an appropriate donor to make the first operation a reality. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, there are 223 kidney transplant programs, 147 heart programs, 79 
liver programs, 74 pancreas programs, 70 heart-lung programs and 55 lung 
programs. A year ago, there were 199 kidney programs, 112 heart, 49 liver, 23 
pancreas, 35 heart-lung and 12 lung. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of January, nearly 250 people nationwide were awaiting heart-lung 
transplants; about 1,400 needed heart transplants; 844 were awaiting liver 
donations; 101 required new lungs; 320 required pancreas transplants, and 
16,315 needed kidneys. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, transplant teams with patients who need immediate care are 
frustrated by a lack of donors. Last year, for the first time, the number of 
heart transplants performed in the United States fell from the previous year's 
total, Jamieson said. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason is not because the number of centers is down -- the total continues 
to grow -- but (donations) have plateaued out at about 2,000 in the U.S," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt that you've got to get the organs or the programs can't 
grow," said Doug Heiney, membership affairs manager for the United Network for 
Organ Sharing, a Washington-based company that oversees nationwide distribution 
of donated organs. "It's a 'chicken-and-egg' situation. If there are no organs 
to supply to the transplant center, you're doomed to failure right from the 
start." 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, donation rates historically have been below the national average, 
in part because local hospitals were not emphasizing donor recruitment. But 
during 1989, when the county's hospitals placed a renewed emphasis on organ 
recovery, donation rates rose to meet the national average, Cutler said. San 
Diego's transplant community believes that, with additional education programs, 
the local donation rate could exceed the national donation rate during 1990. 
</P>
<P>
East Coast organ procurement officials credit Cutler with playing an integral 
role in building an efficient organ procurement program for the Washington 
Regional Transplant Consortium, which distributes organs to six kidney and five 
heart transplant programs. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to strengthening San Diego's procurement efforts, OTAC will begin 
crafting the rules that will govern the local transplant community. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, national regulations determine how donated organs are distributed. 
But the local OTAC organization can help tailor rules that are more in keeping 
with San Diego's special needs, Cutler said. 
</P>
<P>
He intends to bolster San Diego's procurement effort by making better use of a 
California law that requires hospital personnel to seek donated organs from the 
relatives of someone who dies. Cutler believes that many doctors and nurses 
have not been properly trained to undertake that delicate duty. 
</P>
<P>
"The law shouldn't force you to do something you're uncomfortable with," Cutler 
said. "That's what we're here for. We'll do the asking." 
</P>
<P>
However, OTAC's six staff members are ill-prepared to "go out and educate San 
Diego County's 2.5 million residents" about the need for organ donations, 
Cutler said. For the moment, OTAC is focusing on training the doctors and 
nurses who typically are on duty when donors are near death. 
</P>
<P>
Even transplant teams recognize that organ procurement "is a tough job," 
Adamson said. "Even knowing what I know, it would be a tragic (decision to 
make). . . . I'm certain I would give permission, and I have a donor card 
myself, but it still would not be very easy." 
</P>
<P>
"Most people simply don't understand how much good organ recovery does," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The number of recipients generated by one donor can be staggering: According to 
OTAC, the donor who contributed the heart to UCSD's first such transplant 
patient also contributed organs that eventually will end up in as many as 35 
different people. 
</P>
<P>
The donors' two corneas went to individual patients, as did the two kidneys. 
Skin was donated to five burn victims, and bone and tissue that is being stored 
will eventually be used to treat as many as 25 other people. 
</P>
<P>
As difficult as it to find suitable hearts for transplants, it is even more 
difficult to find hearts and lungs that can be used in combination, Adamson 
said. Those transplants are doubly difficult because "there are two clocks 
ticking," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our recipients can get real sick, and they face a high mortality rate without 
transplants . . . but we also have the problem of donors . . . because there 
are only so many hours between the (donor's death) and the time when lungs will 
go bad." 
</P>
<P>
"We can't get many heart-lung" donations, Adamson said. "Because there are so 
many heart recipients waiting, it's just become very, very hard." 
</P>
<P>
Because of that severe shortage, UCSD's transplant team is also considering a 
single lung transplant for Lamberton, an operation that would relieve some of 
the stress on her heart. "You have to take what you can get," Jamieson said. 
"We can't always wait for a perfect situation." 
</P>
<P>
Lamberton, the mother of boys ages 5 and 8, is aware that heart-lung donors are 
hard to find. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that a person has to die for me to get a transplant," she said. "The 
more people I can come in contact with, or who read a story about me, helps. It 
helps other people, too." 
</P>

LAW: JUDY CLARKE'S IDEA OF A GOOD TIME IS BUTTING HEADS IN COURT AND WORKING 80 
HOURS A WEEK. AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF FEDERAL DEFENDERS OF SAN DIEGO, SHE GETS 
PLENTY OF THAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Judy Clarke, San Diego's federal public defender, has the perfect job -- if 
working nights and weekends and squabbling continually with lawyers sounds 
appealing. Clarke can't get enough of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to fight," she said. "And it's a hell of a fight as a defense lawyer. I 
love the action. I love the fight. I like the antagonism. I like the 
adversarial nature of the business. I love all of that. I think that's the fun 
stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"Especially when it's over an issue that I think is of significance to all of 
us, and that's our freedoms, our individual liberties." 
</P>
<P>
Late last month, Clarke, who is executive director of Federal Defenders of San 
Diego Inc., the 17-lawyer agency that defends poor people charged with crimes 
in federal court in San Diego, took her fight to the U.S. Supreme Court. In 
essence, she made a federal case out of a $50 fine. 
</P>
<P>
The case involves a new law that requires people convicted of federal crimes to 
pay "assessments" to a special victims' crime fund. 
</P>
<P>
A Federal Defenders client had to pay a $50 assessment after being convicted of 
two misdemeanor counts of alien smuggling. Clarke told the justices the law is 
illegal because it violates an obscure clause of the U.S. Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
After the argument, Clarke said it went well. That is, "it was lively," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke has made a habit of challenging federal laws she perceives as 
unwarranted intrusions on the Constitution, no matter how arcane the objection. 
Although most lawyers never argue even one case at the U.S. Supreme Court, last 
month's argument marked her second trip there in five years -- both of them on 
technical objections to legal procedure. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke has made a career of defending her clients to the limit. She demands 
that lawyers at Federal Defenders do the same; every attorney at the office 
works at least 60 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
At 37, she also has gained a measure of national fame as an expert in 
constitutional issues relating to criminal law. 
</P>
<P>
In articles and interviews in the legal press, she has detailed her opposition 
to an erosion in constitutional rights that she feels Congress and the federal 
courts have orchestrated in recent years as a reaction to the war on drugs. In 
particular, she has opposed rulings that give police greater latitude to stop 
and detain people without cause. 
</P>
<P>
Her evident passion for what she feels is right has not always won Clarke 
friends, particularly at the downtown San Diego federal courthouse. But she has 
won wide respect, particularly from the other 16 lawyers in her office -- and 
even from federal prosecutors -- for her dedication, determination and work 
ethic. 
</P>
<P>
What really gets Clarke fighting mad, however, is not a response to any legal 
position she takes. It's when she is called a liberal. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know but what my positions have been the most conservative in the 
world, quite frankly," she said. "What does it take to be an absolute supporter 
of what the Constitution says? That's hardly liberal. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't smoke dope," Clarke said. "I don't snort cocaine. I'm not into drugs. 
I don't like drugs. You associate that with a liberal view of a lawyer. I'm not 
into that. I don't like the drug problem the country has. I don't know if you 
can call me a liberal. Yes, I'm a defense lawyer, but I think I have very 
conservative values." 
</P>
<P>
She was imbued with those values while growing up in Asheville, N. C., the 
second of Patsy and Harry Clarke's four children. At their house, the two boys, 
two girls, parents and one set of grandparents gathered for dinner each night 
and argued about the meaning of the "word of the day." 
</P>
<P>
"We were all very loud and very opinionated," Patsy Clarke said last week. 
"Those of us who are remaining still are. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing we really stressed was that you had the right to think whatever 
crazy thing you want to think, as long as you don't make me think it," Patsy 
Clarke said. "But, when you make me think it, that's when I begin to fight." 
</P>
<P>
Harry Clarke died a few years ago in a plane crash. A labor relations 
consultant, he was "a very honest, courageous and aggressive man," Patsy Clarke 
said. "Judy has inherited that." 
</P>
<P>
Judy Clarke went to college at Furman University, in Greenville, S. C., and to 
law school at the University of South Carolina. While a law student, she and 
her husband traveled to Southern California to visit relatives and fell in love 
with San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
After graduation from law school in 1977, she signed on at Federal Defenders. 
In December, 1983, when John Cleary left the agency to go into private 
practice, she took his job as executive director. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the agency has grown from 10 lawyers to 17. Its current budget is 
about $2.7 million. Last year, fiscal year 1989, Federal Defenders handled a 
part of about 6,000 cases, Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
The office has a reputation for demanding a lot from the young lawyers who sign 
on. They sign what Clarke calls a "blood letter," pledging to work a minimum of 
60 hours each week. In exchange, beginning lawyers make about $30,000 a year -- 
but learn quickly how to become proficient at trial skills. Clarke earns about 
$78,000 annually, far less than someone at her level would make at a private 
law firm. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a very good boss," said Knut Johnson, one of the young lawyers at the 
office. "She can be intimidating, though, because she is so energetic and 
intelligent and hard-working. She has standards that are very high and are 
sometimes very difficult for those around her to bring themselves up to. But 
she manages to bring them up to her level of performance and make themselves 
better lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
Clarke herself works "more hours than anybody I know," said her husband, Speedy 
Rice, who is also a lawyer in San Diego but specializes in personal injury and 
aviation law. "I'd say she pushes 80 hours a week. And that's consistent time, 
not spurt time. Day in and day out, she works harder than anybody I know." 
</P>
<P>
Clarke has no hobbies, Rice said. She's not a fan of television and she doesn't 
read a book if it's not law-related, he said. "She is 100% devoted to what she 
does," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To relax, Clarke goes running at 6 a.m. most weekdays with Cleary and with her 
100-pound giant schnauzer, Abe. The dog is named for Abe Fortas, the lawyer who 
won the landmark 1963 U.S. Supreme Court case that established an indigent 
person's right to be represented in court by a lawyer without charge. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke, Cleary said, is committed to the "brutal, vicious pursuit of 
excellence. Not on others, on herself. I worry about her, I do." 
</P>
<P>
But Clarke said she still loves the frenetic pace at Federal Defenders. 
</P>
<P>
"If you like the fight, you've got a good fight here," she said. San Diego 
juries, she said, are "very tough" and "very conservative." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors who have run up against Clarke in court consistently declined to 
comment on reports of friction between her office and theirs. 
</P>
<P>
"We often disagree with her, in court, on issues," U. S. Atty. William Braniff 
said. "But she is, as I say, very determined, and you have to respect that hard 
work and determination." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud for her," Braniff said. "She's a very accomplished person -- 
determined, hard-working, very bright and very committed to her clients." 
</P>
<P>
Clarke said it has become more difficult in recent years to maintain the 
enthusiasm behind that commitment. 
</P>
<P>
"Congress has given real control over the system to the government, and the 
courts have given real control over the system to the government," she said. 
"There's been a real deference to what the majority want, what the law 
enforcement types want. And that's tough. It's tough to make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
In the courts, she said, it used to be the rule that police could briefly 
question someone on the street if they had reason to believe the person was 
engaged in wrongdoing. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the 1960s, though, that 
officers could not detain or arrest a suspect without firm evidence, or 
probable cause, that the person had committed a crime. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, however, several U.S. Supreme Court rulings in drug and 
immigration cases have undercut that doctrine, suggesting instead that police 
may stop, detain and question a person even without evidence of illegal 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
As for Congress, in 1984 it enacted reforms that, in part, made it tougher to 
bail out of jail. In 1986, it brought forth a law that eliminated a judge's 
discretion in sentencing and provided for harsh and rigid prison terms in drug 
cases. In 1988, those drug-related minimum mandatory sentences were toughened. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, related sentencing guidelines took effect, prescribing inflexible 
prison sentences, wiping out parole and all but doing away with probation for a 
variety of crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke has attracted national attention for her opposition to the guidelines. 
Her office was the first in the nation to challenge them, contending they 
violated the Constitution's separation-of-powers provisions because they were 
drawn up by a seven-member panel of judges and professors, instead of by 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Clarke convinced a San Diego federal judge she was right. For some 
months, she kept a running tally, published in a newsletter, of court decisions 
across the country either for or against the guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court later upheld the guidelines, in another case, but Clarke 
remains a strident critic, saying in a recent interview that the guidelines are 
"outrageous" and a "complete disaster." Clarke, who serves on an American Bar 
Assn. committee that studies sentencing standards, said she plans to urge the 
panel in an upcoming meeting to call for the guidelines to be abolished. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke's first trip to the U.S. Supreme Court came in a case decided in 1985. 
It involved the question of whether the Constitution automatically allows a 
defense attorney additional time to prepare if, during a case, prosecutors file 
new charges against a client. No, the court said, in a 9-0 vote. 
</P>
<P>
The case that took Clarke back in late February to the U.S. Supreme Court 
involved yet another technical constitutional question. The "assessments" to 
the special victims' crime fund, which range from $25 to $200, were authorized 
by Congress in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Clarke's client, German Munoz-Flores, pleaded guilty to two 
misdemeanor counts of alien smuggling. He was placed on two years' probation 
and paid a $50 assessment, $25 on each of the counts. 
</P>
<P>
At the sentencing hearing at the downtown San Diego federal courthouse, Clarke 
told U.S. Magistrate Irma E. Gonzalez that the assessments are unconstitutional 
because they stem from a revenue-raising measure that originated in the Senate, 
not the House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
The Constitution, in what lawyers call the "origination clause" of the 
document, requires that all revenue-raising bills originate in the House, 
Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez was unconvinced. Clarke appealed unsuccessfully to U.S. District Judge 
William B. Enright in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke appealed again, to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, the federal 
appellate court that serves nine Western states and Guam. In December, 1988, 
she won. A three-judge panel said the assessments are unconstitutional because 
they violate the origination clause, and it threw out the $50 penalty against 
Munoz-Flores. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, federal courts in the 9th Circuit have not been accepting the 
special assessment. But because the fee was still being collected in other 
federal jurisdictions, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to resolve the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Government attorneys contended in the legal papers they filed with the high 
court that the law is not a revenue-raising measure because the money collected 
under the assessments is deposited into a special crime victims' fund, not into 
the U.S. Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
But Clarke claimed in her legal briefs that the measure is assuredly an 
instrument to raise revenue, regardless of where the money is deposited. 
Further, she said, amounts over a certain level -- a "cap" that began at $100 
million and is scheduled to climb to $150 million by 1994 -- are supposed to go 
into the Treasury's general fund. 
</P>
<P>
The arguments last month featured more of the same, and it was impossible to 
figure out which way the justices might be leaning, Clarke said. "You never 
know which way the court is going to go," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Public defenders are used to losing, she said. So, although a loss might mean 
the end of the fight in this case, it by no means would spell the end of the 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
"You get discouraged constantly when a client gets whacked or a decision comes 
down," Clarke said. "You just sort of have to redefine what a win means. When a 
client says, 'Thank you,' or, 'I heard you were a good lawyer,' or now if 
somebody says, 'I don't like the guidelines -- you were right,' you know, you 
redefine what a win is. 
</P>
<P>
"You learn to take your pleasures in real small little ways. And you go on."

SALK AND THE MEDIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An article by Mr. Anthony Perry on Feb. 16 ("San Diego at Large") asserts that 
the Salk Institute does not encourage "media attention." Nothing could be 
further from the truth. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the same issue of The Times included an article on a new discovery 
made at the institute. Your reporter prepared it with the fullest cooperation 
of our scientists. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is the distinction between information and entertainment, a 
distinction that is in great danger of being blurred. 
</P>
<P>
The report on our recent discovery is information. What we declined to do was 
to work for a producer who requested time for "talking to some of your 
scientists and showing them to do their work" for an entire afternoon. (I quote 
from the producer's telefax.) The program is intended for broadcast in Cologne, 
Germany. Clearly, the program is for the purpose of entertainment, for the 
producer's profit at the expense of scientists' valuable time, and of no 
benefit to either us or the public. 
</P>
<P>
We agreed to cooperate if the producer were to make a donation to the institute 
to help with our work. It is false that we requested "$10,000 for an hour 
interview."

POLICE OVERKILL

The San Diego Police Department is understaffed? They claim that a response 
time of 30 minutes or longer is very common, yet they send 30 cars, motorcycle 
units and a helicopter to corral 200 secondary students conducting an orderly 
protest. Can this be the same understaffed force? 
</P>
<P>
This overreaction should be an embarrassment to the SDPD and the citizens of 
San Diego.

BUDGET BLADE POISED AGAIN TO SLICE ARTS FUNDING; 
</P>
<P>
PRIORITIES: GOVERNMENT HELP ALLOWS THE ARTS TO TAKE THOSE RISKS THAT MAKE THEM 
WORTHY OF BACKING AND FREE THEM FROM THE PLUTOCRATIC DEPENDENCY THAT MAKES THEM 
ELITIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The San Diego City Council faces some hard budget choices: raise taxes or cut 
programs. Like clockwork when it comes time to consider the budget, money for 
the arts gets offered as a sacrificial lamb. 
</P>
<P>
Under the most current proposal, suggested by Councilman Ron Roberts, $4.3 
million would be taken from art and tourist promotion to fund other needs, and, 
under the city manager's worst-case scenario, if no new taxes or fees are 
enacted, $12 million could be diverted. Either scenario, or any other that 
takes money away from the arts, would be a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
It would also violate the spirit of the transient occupancy tax (a hotel room 
tax) increase two years ago. The arts community and tourist industry supported 
the increase only after a promise that the extra revenue would go to art and 
tourism. These proposals would raid the TOT funds for use in the general pot. 
</P>
<P>
After the mayor's "year of the arts" and the hoopla of the Soviet arts 
festival, public support of the arts in San Diego appears to be sinking into 
oblivion. Even the existence of the infant, but effective, Commission for Arts 
and Culture is in question. 
</P>
<P>
The arts are obviously vulnerable and considered a frill in our city. The 
reasons for this have to do with a lack of basic education in the arts, our 
youthful society's relatively short history of supporting the arts, and the 
inability of artists and arts institutions to make a convincing case for public 
support. 
</P>
<P>
Arts organizations have not demonstrated their strength. Their patrons are 
numerous. (Surprisingly, nationally, more people attend arts events than 
sporting events). Furthermore, arts patrons are influential because they are 
voters, contributors and very vocal if enlisted in a cause. 
</P>
<P>
But why are no petitions to our City Council seen in every museum, theater 
lobby or concert hall? And why can't San Diego artists do what has been done 
elsewhere: stop all performances for 10 minutes and say to audiences, "See, 
this is what life would be without art. Write your council member." 
</P>
<P>
The gravest mistake that artists and art institutions make is to play the game 
by the other team's rules. They make their case in terms of marketplace values, 
even though the real worth of the arts to society is that they represent values 
other than those of the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
It is true that the arts spark economic development. They pay out huge sums to 
many businesses and services. Yes, the arts do make San Diego more desirable as 
a home for corporations and make recruiting easier for those businesses that 
are here. 
</P>
<P>
It is evident that the arts increase the appeal of San Diego as a tourist 
destination. And, as San Diegans travel around the country, they find that the 
positive image of our city is bolstered by our vibrant and growing art scene. 
</P>
<P>
The arts can also show why they need government money. While productivity in 
industry increases and it takes less time to produce goods, the arts are labor 
intensive and their costs continue to rise in relationship to the general 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
It can be shown that the real subsidy of the arts comes from the artists 
themselves. Their incomes are a disgrace in a civilized society. That we have 
art at all is due to our artists' sacrifices and generosity. 
</P>
<P>
Although all of these reasons, and many others, are true, they are economic and 
soulless. Happily, society does not measure all of its institutions with a 
monetary yardstick. If it did, Mission Bay park would be sold to developers of 
condos, all libraries would rent out books, and our schools would be private, 
paid for only by those who use them. 
</P>
<P>
The arts have greater difficulty making a case for continuing public support. 
Maybe it is because the public understands that parks, libraries and schools 
nourish us spiritually, mentally or physically, but it sees the arts only as 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it is because the public sees parks, libraries and schools as egalitarian 
institutions but believes the arts are elitist, reserved for the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the public perception of the arts is partly true, because some 
people in the arts community believe that to survive in the present precarious 
financial climate, they must offer mere entertainment and cater to an elite 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Benson, director of the excellent and financially successful South Coast 
Repertory Theatre in Costa Mesa, said, "We once tried to cater to the tastes of 
our audience and found that their taste fell faster than we could cater to it." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, the arts are partly to blame for their problems. Too often control 
is vested in boards made up of wealthy donors, and too seldom are risks taken 
to lead rather than follow public taste. But before any council members use 
this criticism of the arts to deny funding, they should examine the parallels 
between arts' predicament and their own political situation. 
</P>
<P>
The rising costs of election campaigning has created the public perception that 
rich campaign contributors have a growing and unfair influence with elected 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
It is also believed that council members are not taking those difficult 
leadership risks they were elected to take. By submitting controversial issues 
to the voters as referendums, they are not doing the job they are paid to do. 
</P>
<P>
In both the arts and politics, a momentary loss of courage and an unhealthy 
dependence on fat-cat donors does not mean scrapping the institutions. As 
politicians look for alternate ways to finance campaigns, the arts look to 
government support to fulfill their mission. 
</P>
<P>
The paradox is that more government support will allow the arts to take those 
risks that make them worthy of support and free them from the plutocratic 
dependency that makes them elitist. Less government support will drive them 
further from their mission of delivering messages of importance to our whole 
society. 
</P>
<P>
The arts' mission deserves public support. It is to complete the mosaic of our 
civil life with a tolerant forum for ideas, emotions, institutions and insights 
that are available in no other way. 
</P>
<P>
When seeking physical well-being, we are told "no pain, no gain." The same is 
true of our aesthetic well-being. Our citizens must be aware that support of 
art is not a risk-free enterprise. In a time of profound worldwide changes, 
artists are affected by what is happening and will explore concepts that some 
of us may not want to think about. They may speak to us of our sexuality, of 
how we treat one another, of the failures of our system of government or of the 
greed in our market economy. 
</P>
<P>
A time of great change brings great fears. But we must learn to be brave enough 
to listen to our artists. As playwright David Mamet says, "The artist is the 
advance explorer of the societal consciousness. As such, many times his first 
reports are disbelieved." 
</P>
<P>
The value of art to society is that it opens our minds to new perceptions, 
unthought-of possibilities, and prepares us emotionally for what we will 
eventually understand rationally. Art asks us questions and leads us to wonder, 
amazement and growth. 
</P>
<P>
These are the valuable gifts the arts can give to San Diego. They go far beyond 
the economic advantages we usually hear about. They are priceless. 
</P>
<P>
The arts-funding problem is particularly critical in San Diego. We are an 
adolescent city moving toward adulthood, making life decisions, forming a 
character that will define our civic personality for generations to come. Will 
we be the largest bubble-headed resort town on the West Coast? Or, as a mature 
city, will we be a metropolis where the geographical beauty is matched by the 
strength of our culture? 
</P>
<P>
That future is being decided now by our City Council.

FITNESS CENTER FOR DISABLED IS DEDICATED; 
</P>
<P>
EXERCISE: IT'S THE FIRST CITY-OPERATED FACILITY OF ITS KIND, WITH EQUIPMENT 
DESIGNED FOR WHEELCHAIR WORKOUTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
With a little pomp and a lot of festivity, the first city-operated fitness 
facility for the disabled in Los Angeles was dedicated Saturday at the 
Chatsworth Park South Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
The program included the solemn ceremonial events expected at an official 
occasion: presentation of the colors by a local Boy Scout troop, the Pledge of 
Allegiance, an invocation, introduction of city officials and a ribbon-cutting 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
But the formal part of the program was kept to a minimum so the real stars of 
the day -- the disabled people served by the new fitness center -- could take 
the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
They were featured in demonstrations that showcased their talents in song, 
dance, arts, horseback riding and sports such as wheelchair tennis and 
basketball for the 250 people who attended the opening. 
</P>
<P>
The fitness center, in a newly built room adjoining the park's main building, 
features exercise equipment that is custom-built so that handicapped people can 
use it while seated in their wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
For example, one machine allows the performance of five different exercises 
from electric and manual wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
Partially funded by a $1.3-million grant from the Amateur Athletic Foundation 
of Los Angeles, the center is the first of three for the disabled that will be 
installed in city recreation facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my personal dreams is to have places like this where people in 
wheelchairs can come to work out throughout the city," said Ce Etta Crayton, 
consultant to the city Recreation and Parks Department's Adaptive Sports 
Program. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, this is not only the first center of its kind in the city of 
Los Angeles but in the entire country. And it will become a model for others. 
After all, there aren't a lot of places people in wheelchairs can go to work 
out." 
</P>
<P>
A second center will open at Martin Luther King Recreation Center in 
South-Central Los Angeles within a year, Crayton said. The third will be 
installed at the Elysian Park Recreation Center in late 1992 or in 1993, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the fitness center at Chatsworth Park was $224,000. The foundation, 
created to manage the surplus from the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, 
contributed $124,000. The city -- using state funds earmarked for recreation -- 
paid the balance. The other two planned centers will each receive $588,000 from 
the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
According to statistics compiled by the state Department of Rehabilitation, 
about 96,000 disabled people live in the San Fernando Valley, which has one of 
the largest disabled populations in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"In recent years, there hasn't been too much to meet their needs," said Eileen 
Libbey, recreation therapist in charge of the disabled program at Chatsworth 
Park. A survey on recreational needs in the Valley by the Recreation and Parks 
Department in 1988 showed that there is a dearth of activities for the 
disabled, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth Park's year-old recreation program for the disabled offers such 
activities as drama, music and wheelchair sports to about 300 disabled people 
between the ages of 5 and 93, Libbey said. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Councilman Hal Bernson and other city officials shared the 
spotlight with wheelchair-bound Erich Malone of Chatsworth; actor Brad 
Silverman, 23, who has Down's syndrome, and the handicapped members of the 
Brite Lites Theater Company. 
</P>
<P>
Erich, a 9-year-old who has muscular dystrophy, cut the ribbon dedicating the 
facility and was the first to try the equipment. "This is neat," he said, 
flexing his arm muscles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing how far we handicapped kids can go," said Silverman, who was 
featured in the Feb. 11 segment of the television series "Life Goes On." 
</P>
<P>
The Brite Lites troupe grew out of the Chatsworth center's program for the 
handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just wonderful, aren't they?" beaming music teacher Pat Weistling said 
as she watched the members of the company sing and dance their way through 
"Oklahoma!" and a medley of other show tunes. 
</P>
<P>
"They've looked forward to this day," Weistling said. "They've been preparing 
for it for months. It truly is their day." 
</P>
<P>
The fitness center will be open on a limited schedule: 4 to 8 p.m. Tuesdays, 3 
to 6 p.m. Thursdays and 1 to 5 p.m. Saturdays.

HEARING SOUGHT ON SEWAGE PLANT WAIVER; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: IN AN ACTION SURE TO REKINDLE CONTROVERSY OVER THE CARSON 
FACILITY, THE COUNTY ASKS TO PRESENT MORE INFORMATION TO THE EPA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a move that drew fire from environmentalists, the Los Angeles County 
Sanitation Districts on Friday requested a public hearing to seek a federal 
waiver that would exempt its giant sewage plant in Carson from tighter 
treatment standards. 
</P>
<P>
The request, made to the federal Environmental Protection Agency, comes two 
months after the EPA tentatively rejected the sanitation districts' formal 
application for the waiver. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing request is sure to rekindle controversy over treatment at the 
Carson plant, which each day pumps 365 million gallons of effluent into the 
ocean through outfalls south of the Palos Verdes Peninsula. The facility serves 
dozens of sanitation districts from Palos Verdes Estates to Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Sanitation officials have estimated that it would cost ratepayers $350 million 
to meet federal standards requiring full secondary treatment, a system that 
makes use of biological processes to remove 85% of solids from waste water. 
</P>
<P>
Although 60% of the effluent from the Carson plant already receives secondary 
treatment, the rest undergoes less intensive screening. 
</P>
<P>
"The county sanitation districts have been spending an incredible amount of 
taxpayers' money to evade and avoid going to full (sewage) treatment," said 
Dorothy Green, president of Heal the Bay, a Santa Monica-based environmental 
group. "We are thoroughly disgusted by the lengths to which they are willing to 
go to avoid living up to their responsibilities." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the sanitation districts said his agency's request was a 
well-intentioned attempt to get a fair hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not simply a delay tactic," said the spokesman, Joe Haworth. "We have 
a need to put our evidence forward. We believe we've got some points to make 
that we don't think (the EPA) responded to." 
</P>
<P>
The sanitation districts argue that their effluent does not pose a threat to 
marine life. They also say that removing more solids would be dangerous because 
they help cap a layer of bay sediment contaminated by hundreds of tons of the 
pesticide DDT discharged in the 1950s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
In its tentative denial Jan. 30 of the districts' waiver request, EPA Regional 
Administrator Daniel McGovern rejected both arguments. However, an EPA official 
said Friday that given the importance of the issue, it is likely that the 
agency will grant the districts a public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"My guess is we will probably hold one," said Janet Hashimoto, oceans and 
estuaries chief at the agency's San Francisco regional office. 
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said that arrangements have to be made and a 30-day public notice 
period has to be held before the hearing, which would be conducted by an EPA 
official. 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, the EPA will decide whether to stand by its Jan. 30 denial, 
she said. Even if the tentative ruling is upheld, she added, agency rules allow 
for further administrative challenges by the sanitation districts.

MEXICO PLANT'S ACID LEAK WAS WORSE THAN AQMD MODEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By GEORGE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
When air quality officials recommended in January that hydrofluoric acid be 
banned from use in Los Angeles County, oil and chemical industry spokesmen 
attacked their report as "unrealistic," saying it was predicated on such a 
large release of the chemical that no accident of that magnitude is likely to 
occur. 
</P>
<P>
However, The Times has learned that an even larger release of the acutely 
hazardous substance occurred in 1980 in Matamoros, Mexico, killing two workers 
and injuring 11 others. 
</P>
<P>
In the Matamoros accident, which is believed to be the largest release of 
hydrofluoric acid on record, the chemical poured out for 20 minutes from a 
ruptured valve at a rate of 500 gallons a minute, creating a dense cloud of 
toxic fumes. 
</P>
<P>
The report by the South Coast Air Quality Management District was based on a 
release of 70 gallons a minute for 100 minutes. Its computer study was based on 
a 1987 accident at a refinery in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
The Times has also learned of two other major releases from an Australian 
refinery in 1976 and 1977. There were no serious injuries from either of the 
Australian accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Camarena, deputy executive director of the AQMD, said last week that 
information about the Matamoros accident, as well as the two Australian 
releases, refutes industry criticism that the air quality staff is too 
pessimistic about the potential for accidents involving the chemical. 
</P>
<P>
Camarena said his staff was not aware of the three incidents -- each involving 
the release of thousands of gallons of hydrofluoric acid -- until The Times 
made inquiries about them. 
</P>
<P>
He said the information obtained by The Times shows that "significantly larger 
quantities can, and have, escaped from these facilities (using hydrofluoric 
acid) . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Hydrofluoric acid is so toxic that the release of a teaspoonful in a 
500-square-foot room would create an immediate danger to life and health, 
according to state health officials. 
</P>
<P>
Four oil refineries in Los Angeles County and an Allied-Signal plant in El 
Segundo each typically have acid inventories ranging from 7,000 to 29,000 
gallons. The oil refineries are Mobil in Torrance, Ultramar in Wilmington and 
Powerine and Golden West in Santa Fe Springs. 
</P>
<P>
The hazards of hydrofluoric acid became an issue in the South Bay after about 
12 gallons were released during an explosion and fire at Mobil's Torrance 
refinery on on Nov. 24, 1987. One worker at the plant has alleged in a lawsuit 
that he suffered lung damage from breathing acid fumes. 
</P>
<P>
Federal safety officials later concluded that Mobil would have avoided the 
accident if refinery officials had followed their own written safety 
instructions. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance voters go to the polls Tuesday to vote on a ballot measure that would 
effectively ban the use of hydrofluoric acid at the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Ultramar, Mobil and Allied-Signal attacked the AQMD in 
January when staffers recommended banning the substance after studying the 
probable consequences of a major release in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
One of the critics, William E. Hague, an Allied-Signal engineering expert, said 
last week that he had been aware of the Mexican and Australian releases and 
that he remains critical of the AQMD study because it was predicated on a 
rupture in a four-inch valve; Allied-Signal's plant only uses one-inch valves. 
</P>
<P>
Another critic of the AQMD, Ultramar refinery manager Marshall A. (Bud) Bell, 
said he was unaware of the three releases. However, he challenged the relevance 
of the information. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not logical to say that just because something happened at some 
facility, that it is going to happen at my facility," he said. "While I can 
say, 'That is interesting. That is amazing,' I am not really worried about it 
because I know it can't happen here." 
</P>
<P>
Mobil spokesman Tom Collins said late Friday that the oil company had no 
comment on the information about the three major spills. 
</P>
<P>
Camarena said, however, that the information would be helpful in his agency's 
continuing evaluation of the hazards of hydrofluoric acid and "does indeed 
verify" that the AQMD did not use "overly pessimistic assumptions" in analyzing 
the consequences of a release from local facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD used computerized estimation techniques to predict the consequences of 
an accident here that would be similar to a 1987 release at the Marathon Oil 
refinery in Texas City, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
The Texas City accident was caused when construction workers dropped a 30-ton 
piece of equipment on pipelines connected to a tank containing 35,700 gallons 
of hydrofluoric acid. The resulting leak released an estimated 6,548 gallons of 
hydrofluoric acid, forcing the evacuation of 4,000 residents, sending 1,037 to 
area hospitals, and defoliating trees for miles. No one died. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD's main finding was that even with efforts to control such a release, a 
cloud of acid fumes would threaten the lives of nearby residents. The report 
also said that a similar release of less volatile sulfuric acid, which is being 
considered as an alternative in refineries, would not produce a toxic gas 
cloud. 
</P>
<P>
The Matamoros accident occurred at the Quimica Fluor plant, which manufactures 
hydrofluoric acid. The two employees who died were trapped in a building 
engulfed by fumes, plant manager Javier Villarreal said in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
An employee eventually donned a protective suit and shut off a valve to stop 
the release. A small community near the plant, which is in a rural area 4 1/2 
miles outside Matamoros, was spared because the wind was blowing the other 
direction, Villarreal said. 
</P>
<P>
After the accident, Villarreal said, metallurgical analysis determined that the 
studs holding the valve cover had been weakened by hydrofluoric acid. He said 
that more resistant alloys now are used and that no similar accident has 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the 11 employees who were injured have suffered no long-term 
consequences and that the plant now receives awards for its safety program. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ronald Koopman, a scientist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory 
who has studied the hazards of hydrofluoric acid since the mid-1980s, told The 
Times about two major releases from the Ampol refinery in Brisbane, Australia. 
His information was confirmed by Ampol refinery general manager Barry Woods and 
Australian safety officials. 
</P>
<P>
The first Ampol release, which occurred Dec. 22, 1976, was caused when a heavy 
steel bar fell onto a heat exchanger during a construction project. The heat 
exchanger was connected to a tank containing 28 tons, or about 7,000 gallons, 
of hydrofluoric acid, all of which was released. 
</P>
<P>
Ultramar's Bell and Koopman said Ampol used poor judgment in undertaking a 
construction project near the tank without draining it of its dangerous 
contents . 
</P>
<P>
"That's pretty foolish," Bell said. ". . . It is certainly contrary to what we 
would do. You can't condone that." 
</P>
<P>
Said Koopman: "They never should have worked on the tower without draining the 
unit. It is inconceivable, but, of course, Marathon (in Texas) was doing the 
same damn thing." 
</P>
<P>
Ampol's Woods said in a statement that the release took about 2 1/2 hours, for 
an average rate of about 50 gallons a minute. 
</P>
<P>
Woods said that refinery workers controlled the release with fire sprays and 
fog nozzles and that some of the gas was vented to a relief system where it 
could be neutralized. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no record of any employee being exposed to HF vapor to the extent 
which required any medical or even first-aid treatment," Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
The second Ampol release took place on July 8, 1977, and was caused by the 
failure of a weld. It again led to a release of 7,000 gallons but no estimate 
of the rate is available. 
</P>
<P>
Woods reported that one worker inhaled toxic fumes, was sent to a hospital for 
"precautionary checks and was then sent home." Woods said the employee remains 
at the refinery and "is in the best of health." 
</P>
<P>
He added, "Both incidents were handled professionally by the refinery work 
force with no outside assistance being required. There were no significant 
injuries to refinery personnel. There was no impact beyond the refinery 
perimeter. There have been no similar incidents in the elapsed 13 years." 
</P>
<P>
Camarena said that AQMD staff members now are trying to obtain full reports of 
the three accidents from local authorities and company officials. 
</P>
<P>
In Torrance, clouds of hydrofluoric acid escaped the Mobil refinery grounds and 
led Torrance authorities to close Crenshaw Boulevard for several hours on Nov. 
25 and Nov. 29, 1987, according to Torrance Fire Department reports. 
</P>
<P>
The release on Nov. 29 was caused when an employee accidentally opened a valve 
to a pipe containing acid vapors, according to the Fire Department. The report 
said refinery workers were able to shut the valve within five minutes. An 
estimate of the rate of the release or the amount released was not available. 
The Fire Department did not list a cause of the Nov. 25 release, and no 
injuries were reported in either case. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent incident involving hydrofluoric acid in Los Angeles was a 
release Jan. 13 at the Powerine Oil Co. in Santa Fe Springs, which sent seven 
refinery workers to the hospital. The incident occurred when a corroded pipe 
holding the acid ruptured, creating a vapor cloud that employees diluted with 
water and stopped from drifting outside the refinery, according to oil company 
officials.

Mobil refinery -- A March 4 article in the South Bay edition incorrectly stated 
that Torrance Fire Department reports said clouds of hydrofluoric acid vapors 
had escaped the Mobil Oil Corp. refinery grounds on Nov. 25 and Nov. 29, 1987. 
Neither report said that fumes left the refinery boundaries, although 
authorities did close off Crenshaw Boulevard, which runs through the refinery. 
Mobil spokesman Tom Collins said no acid vapors escaped the refinery property.

DESPITE FUROR, GLENDALE IS READY TO VOTE ON STREET PARKING CONTROLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Glendale City Council members instructed their staff last March to 
draft an ordinance regulating overnight parking as part of a broad plan to 
control the city's burgeoning growth, no one suspected that they had lit a fuse 
that would generate political fireworks for months to come. 
</P>
<P>
A year later -- with charges of discrimination, hidden revenue scams and 
"ignoring the will of the people" still ringing in their ears -- council 
members are preparing to vote on the proposal soon. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, the harder officials tried to convince residents that the 
parking policy was necessary and fair, the more opposition they seemed to 
galvanize. 
</P>
<P>
The city's problems began in August when residents found out that the Parking 
Commission was considering the city proposal to require paid permits for street 
parking in south Glendale between 2 and 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
During three public hearings, stern-faced commissioners looked down on a 
disgruntled audience that heckled and booed them. Audience members charged that 
commissioners were making a mockery of the democratic system by holding 
hearings with their minds already made up. 
</P>
<P>
At the fourth hearing, police in riot gear pushed back an angry mob trying to 
force its way into an already packed auditorium. The commissioners' comments 
were drowned out by the shouting outside and the pounding on the glass entrance 
door. 
</P>
<P>
The sixth hearing was held at the Civic Auditorium and about 300 showed up. A 
hand count showed the obvious: Only a few supported the government initiative. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 residents showed up at the final hearing. Outside City Hall, a dozen 
demonstrators carried picket signs with anti-government slogans. The biggest 
sign lent an Orwellian touch to the drama, asking "What's Next, Big Brother?" 
In a last-ditch effort to stop the plan, many invoked the winds of freedom 
sweeping Eastern Europe. Nonetheless, the commission approved the 
city-sponsored proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council will consider the parking proposal in upcoming weeks after 
parking commissioners complete a report outlining the reasons behind their 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale's parking woes are but a symptom of a difficult problem facing the 
city in its struggle to tame the effects of its seemingly unavoidable 
urbanization. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, the issue of overnight parking seems an unlikely candidate to 
provoke widespread public discontent. 
</P>
<P>
But as the city changes, so does its political culture. Thousands of immigrants 
from the Middle East, Asia and Latin America are flocking to what was once 
considered a relatively affluent, mostly white bedroom community that proudly 
preserved its small-town flavor. 
</P>
<P>
On Brand Boulevard, Glendale's broad, palm tree-lined main street, cars still 
park diagonally, the same way they have since the advent of the automobile. 
Brand is surrounded by a huge shopping mall, old one- and two-story buildings 
housing small businesses, and towering iron-and-glass skyscrapers that serve as 
headquarters for large corporations. There are few residences, so the streets 
are nearly deserted overnight. 
</P>
<P>
To the north, on the hillsides and in the canyons, neighbors manicure the 
gardens of their spacious single-family homes, while their cars rest safely 
tucked away in their two- and three-car garages. The streets remain relatively 
uncluttered at all times. 
</P>
<P>
But in the increasingly dense and ethnically mixed apartment neighborhoods 
south of the Ventura Freeway, where old Glendale is quickly giving way to the 
new, few people can afford the luxury of keeping their cars off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the apartments there have insufficient parking, and several landlords 
rent some of their garage space for storage. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the families moving in generally are bigger and have more cars 
than the community of senior citizens that made up most of the city's apartment 
population less than two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
In the last 10 years, Glendale's population has jumped from 145,000 to about 
190,000, with most of the new arrivals settling in south Glendale apartments 
and condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, cars line both sides of the streets most nights and evenings. The 
problem, however, has not reached desperate proportions. Even in the most 
crowded areas, residents may be forced to park half a block away from their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
But from the perspective of the city's powerful Chamber of Commerce, the 
situation is intolerable already. The city relies on its squeaky-clean image to 
attract upscale businesses to its downtown commercial district. 
</P>
<P>
Chamber and city leaders have made it clear they believe that the sight of 
cluttered streets and the influx of residents make the city less attractive. 
</P>
<P>
"It is believed this ordinance would . . . offer an indirect approach to 
limiting the number of persons living in residential units and limit the number 
of automobiles," the chamber stated in its newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, at least a dozen other Southern California cities have similar 
ordinances and rarely does anybody make a fuss about them. But those cities had 
different reasons for their ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
In the Melrose district in Los Angeles, for example, permit parking was 
instituted to keep shoppers in the commercial district from taking up 
residents' parking spaces. And in Pasadena and South Pasadena, the ordinances 
were adopted decades ago to aid street sweeping, when parking congestion was 
not an issue. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale Traffic Engineer Tom Horne can recite a list of cities with overnight 
parking restrictions, but he cannot point to a single one where the conditions 
are even close to what is taking place in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
"Our situation is unique," Horne said. "We've taken bits and pieces from 
different cities and adapted them to Glendale's needs." 
</P>
<P>
City leaders in Glendale feel strongly about the unpopular overnight parking 
ordinance because they believe that it will serve as a much-needed 
growth-control mechanism to curtail the city's population explosion. 
</P>
<P>
Last March, at the City Council's request, Horne wrote the first draft of the 
overnight parking ordinance and introduced it to the volunteer Parking 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
In January, after the proposal had been widely criticized in public hearings, 
the chamber endorsed it. 
</P>
<P>
Besides making it more difficult for large numbers of people to continue moving 
into Glendale, the proposed ordinance would "help the city of Glendale for 
aesthetic reasons, increase safety by allowing better access to emergency 
vehicles, provide better access in street sweeping," according to an unsigned 
article on the chamber publication's front page. 
</P>
<P>
By then, the draft ordinance had been modified substantially from what was 
first proposed. Initially, Horne had suggested that the city charge $15 for the 
first parking permit, and up to $120 for a fourth permit if needed. Residents 
would receive 14 one-day guest permits per year per household, and the permit 
program would apply to south Glendale only. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, south Glendale residents filled the hearing rooms and accused the 
city of discrimination for targeting their neighborhoods, and of unfair 
taxation disguised as permit charges. 
</P>
<P>
The residents of south Glendale complained about the loss of privacy if they 
are required to inform the city when they have overnight guests and said they 
were being forced to pay because the city had failed to plan for the increase 
in automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
If there is a parking problem, many of them contended, then the city should 
build public parking structures to solve it. City officials quickly dismissed 
this alternative as fiscally unsound. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the shoving incident in September, Horne decided to cancel hearings 
in November and December and come back with a revised proposal for the Jan. 27 
meeting at the Civic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
While the proposal needed some fine-tuning, Horne and Councilman Dick Jutras 
insisted that the main problem was that the people did not understand what the 
ordinance would do. 
</P>
<P>
New Image, a local public relations firm that does much work for the city, was 
hired to prepare an illustrated brochure that was mailed out citywide, inviting 
residents to the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The revised ordinance introduced in January would be enforced citywide to avoid 
the appearance of discrimination. The first two permits would be free, and the 
number of $2 guest permits would be increased from 14 to 60 per household. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of deflecting criticism, the changes broadened opposition. For the 
first time, residents from all over the city spoke up against the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
South Glendale residents continued to argue that the proposal did not make 
sense and that it amounted to taxing the poor. North Glendale residents were 
furious because they would be inconvenienced by the permit process for a 
problem that did not exist in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing else had changed. Once again, Horne and the parking commissioners were 
jeered, heckled and made fun of by a crowd that was growing increasingly 
cynical, bitter and disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"You say you are doing this to get cars off the streets, but all you're going 
to get is cars on the streets with stickers on them," south Glendale resident 
Bob Moynahan said as the crowd of 300 laughed and applauded. 
</P>
<P>
By then, Citizens Against Parking Permits had been formed. On the mornings 
before the hearings, its members would drive around the city between 2 and 6 
a.m. and place flyers and petitions on parked cars. 
</P>
<P>
The flyers, decorated with enlargements of $20 and $50 bills, ask: "How much 
are you willing to pay the city to park at night?" and list arguments against 
the proposed ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Close to 1,000 people signed the group's petitions against the proposal, 
addressed to the Parking Commission. In February, the group organized two small 
demonstrations in front of City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
By the time that Horne and the Parking Commission held their final February 
hearing, both residents and city officials seemed to have given up trying to 
change each others' minds. No flyers were mailed, no new proposals were 
unveiled and fewer than 50 people attended. 
</P>
<P>
Resigned and subdued, the audience applauded unenthusiastically as speakers 
stretched their imaginations to come up with new arguments against the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is, do we live in a democracy or a dictatorship?" asked C. E. 
Cadden, one of the speakers. 
</P>
<P>
On that day, Horne cited a new report that outlined for the first time the 
projected costs and revenue of the overnight parking ordinance. Since the 
beginning, Horne had contended that the city would not make money from the 
ordinance, "only recover costs." 
</P>
<P>
Several speakers had questioned this in previous hearings. Some had even called 
Horne a liar. Upon careful review, the document showed that despite start-up 
costs, the city stood to gain more than $200,000 the first year alone from 
permit fees and parking fines. 
</P>
<P>
Less than a dozen people stayed until the end of the hearing to witness the 
commission vote 3 to 2 in favor of the proposal. Those who did stay were hardly 
surprised. 
</P>
<P>
"They've bulldozed this thing through since the beginning," sighed a 
tired-looking Dale Goeden, who was slumped on a chair near the back row. "We 
all knew this would happen."

MORNINGSIDE HAS A POSITIVE SIDE

<TEXT>
<P>
I am a very concerned freshman who attends Morningside High School in 
Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
Although I did not participate in the protest, I feel very frustrated that the 
media has brought primarily negative attention to our school. 
</P>
<P>
I understand that our school has many problems. They shouldn't be ignored, but 
the media makes it seem that Morningside is so bad that students fear walking 
from class to class. I'm sure Los Angeles Times readers think bad things about 
us. The school has many positive points too. 
</P>
<P>
Many parents may have considered sending their children to Morningside. 
However, I'm sure they've lost interest now. Please present both sides of the 
picture in further newspaper articles about our school.

Free samples are a staple during a gourmet shopping trip any day of the week, 
but Saturdays are a bonanza for tasters at such markets as Bristol Farms in 
South Pasadena and Rolling Hills Estates, Jurgensen's in Pasadena, and Trader 
Joe's stores around the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
By 11 a.m., the eats are out and the bumper cart wars have begun. 
</P>
<P>
There's jostling for lingonberry juice, grabbing for foie gras, crumb-snatching 
for the crackers spread with radicchio pate. Moms quiet toddlers with 
strategically timed bites of veal paupiettes. Weekend jocks gird themselves to 
nibble goat cheese. Sweet grandmothers take extra chunks of herb cheese for 
fictitious shopping companions. 
</P>
<P>
And then there are the dreaded "sample rats." 
</P>
<P>
So dubbed (secretly) by the behind-the-counter crowd at Bristol Farms, sample 
rats are simply those moochers who come to try but not to buy. When they 
suggest lunch at Bristol Farms, they don't mean in the cafe. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a certain percentage of people who go nuts over free food. They think 
they've got to eat as much as they possibly can," said Seth Feldman, grocery 
director for Bristol Farms. 
</P>
<P>
Store Manager David Gronsky conceded: "You let it slide a lot. When I see 
somebody like that -- there are a few obvious regulars -- I will sometimes give 
an eye signal to employees to pull the samples for a few minutes. A lot of 
times they're good customers, though, and you just let them do it." 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of food samples, after all, is not just economic, Gronsky said. 
</P>
<P>
"The philosophy, yes, is sales, and I've never had a sample that didn't help 
sales," Gronsky said. "But much more important, they're a way to get employees 
familiar with the products, a way to get to know buyers and a way to break the 
ice with customers. 
</P>
<P>
"Samples create an atmosphere in the store. It's festive, like a food show, 
where people are invited to come in and try something new." 
</P>
<P>
Jurgensen's has even appointed a "sample coordinator." Carolyn Hallett, also in 
charge of buying cookbooks for the market, said samples also alert shoppers to 
new or offbeat products. 
</P>
<P>
"If we get something new in, it can sit on a shelf forever unless you pull it 
out and bring it to people's attention," Hallett said. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn and Richard Brown of San Gabriel said they never would have bought 
Fleur du Lait cheese had it not been for the samples they noshed on at Bristol 
Farms. Now it's a staple of their shopping list -- and they're always scouting 
for new candidates. Marilyn Brown found another possibility in the Shelton's 
turkey chili they spooned out of little paper cups on a recent Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman noted that shoppers who spot a new product in a chain grocery store 
have probably seen it in a TV commercial or read about it in a magazine, and 
now hold a coupon for it in their hand. Not so for limestone lettuce or 
cherimoya, an exotic fruit. 
</P>
<P>
"The best way to market these products is to put the taste in the customer's 
mouth," Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
Hallett offered as an example the Swedish lingonberry juice served to 
Jurgensen's shoppers several weeks ago. "We sold a lot of it the first day we 
sampled it, and we're still selling it to customers who come back with it on 
their shopping lists. 
</P>
<P>
"Once people find a product they like and they buy it, they're hooked." 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers took more slowly to the wild mushrooms in cream sauce Hallett dished 
out about a month ago. Sales on sample day, she said, were lackluster. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, well, this is a bomb. But they came back the next week to buy. It 
wasn't something people wanted to serve for dinner that night, but they 
remembered the flavor," Hallett said. 
</P>
<P>
Not that there are never flops. It's tough to get people to taste, much less 
purchase, goat cheese, sample coordinators agreed. And Bristol Farms recently 
yanked a "major dud spaghetti sauce. You had to sample a full case to sell one 
bottle," admitted Gronsky, who declined to name the brand. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the spectrum is the success story of Granmere's salad 
dressing, Feldman said. When Ernie Parmentier coaxed Feldman to taste his New 
Orleans grandmother's powerful recipe, his first reaction was, "No way." 
</P>
<P>
But Parmentier donned an apron himself and lured shoppers by asking: "You like 
garlic? Try this." Ten cases disappeared the first day. Ten the next. 
Granmere's became all the rage.

VOTERS WILL ALSO DECIDE AIRPORT ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although most attention in Tuesday's Torrance election has focused elsewhere, 
voters will also decide on Measure C. The proposal would change city accounting 
procedures for money earned from the Torrance Municipal Airport and its 
adjacent commercial properties. 
</P>
<P>
If passed, the measure would repeal a portion of the City Charter that requires 
the money to be kept in a separate airport fund used to pay airport bonds and 
other expenses. The fund was approved by voters in 1957. It kept the city from 
financial responsibility for the bonds, making only the airport and revenue it 
produced liable for the borrowed funds. 
</P>
<P>
The bonds will be paid off in March, and city officials say the protection of 
the charter provision is now unnecessary. They have called the ballot measure a 
"housekeeping" move, which would simply place airport funds under the same 
accounting practices used for other revenues produced by the agencies in the 
city's Transportation Department. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, airport operating revenues are spent on the airport, though much of 
the additional revenue from the businesses -- car dealerships and shopping 
centers -- on airport property are spent on other city obligations. The airport 
runs at a surplus when revenues from these businesses that are not related to 
aviation are included in its balance sheet. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, airport monies would still have to be placed in a separate 
account, city officials have said, though the City Council would have greater 
discretion in spending them. 
</P>
<P>
But some pilots, who have clashed with City Council members in recent months 
over airport operations, say it is the first step by the city in a possible 
campaign to close the airport. 
</P>
<P>
In the ballot argument against the measure, Barry Jay of the Torrance Airport 
Boosters Assn. says changing the charter will make city residents liable for 
the cost of operating the airport.

5 ARRESTED IN STABBING DEATH OF TORRANCE MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Torrance police arrested five people Friday and Saturday in the stabbing death 
of a Torrance man in his home, and said they expect more arrests. 
</P>
<P>
William Smith, 39, was attacked in his home in the 3900 block of 171st Street 
before dawn Friday, and was pronounced dead from stab wounds at Little Company 
of Mary Hospital, police said. 
</P>
<P>
California Highway Patrol officers Friday arrested Gary Jose Alderete, 21, of 
Torrance as he was running along the northbound lanes of the San Diego Freeway 
about a mile from Smith's house. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance Police Lt. Mike Tamble said homicide detectives arrested four others 
Friday and early Saturday morning on charges of murder and conspiracy to commit 
murder. Tamble said the stabbing was apparently planned by the suspects after 
Smith fought with one of the arrested men earlier this week, but he did not 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested were Michael Patrick Grace, 21, of Carson; Stacy Noelle James, 20, of 
Torrance; Alexander Vincent Frederick, 22, of Gardena, and Richard Allen Grace, 
23, of Gardena. All five are being held without bail at the Torrance police 
station. 
</P>
<P>
Tamble said the investigation is continuing and police expect to make more 
arrests in the case. 
</P>
<P>
A "blade-type weapon" was recovered at the scene, and evidence pointing to a 
conspiracy to kill Smith was taken from one suspect's house Friday, Tamble 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors of Smith said Saturday that he and his common-law wife, Cathy 
Mazzoni, who called police, had lived in the neighborhood about two months.

TELEPHONE TECHNOLOGY VS. PRIVACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Will new phone services invade your privacy? Should they be allowed? 
</P>
<P>
 In the next few months, Pacific Bell plans to ask the state Public Utilities 
Commission for permission to sell in California a set of controversial new 
services. Already available in eight states, the new products are based on 
technology that allows telephone customers to track the phone numbers from 
which incoming calls are made. 
</P>
<P>
 The most hotly debated of the new services is called Number ID. It would 
display the phone number of the person calling on a screen at the home or 
business where the call is directed. Other services include Call Trace, which 
notifies police departments of the origin of harassing calls, and Call Block, 
which allows people to program their phones to not accept calls from certain 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, the Legislature has required the phone company to provide 
per-call blocking, which enables callers to protect their numbers from being 
displayed by dialing a code before each call. 
</P>
<P>
 For a discussion of privacy issues raised by the new products, free-lance 
journalist Sharon Bernstein interviewed consumer advocate Ken McEldowney of the 
San Francisco watchdog group, Consumer Action, and Ethan Thorman, Pacific 
Bell's product manager for the new products. 
</P>
<P>
 * What privacy issues are raised by Number ID? 
</P>
<P>
Thorman: It raises the issue of whose right to privacy is more compelling, the 
person making the call or the person receiving the call. It's the person making 
the call possibly wanting to protect his anonymity versus the person receiving 
the call wanting to know who is calling. 
</P>
<P>
When Pacific Bell gets about 1 million calls per year from customers 
complaining about annoyance calls, how do you give those people who have been 
harassed a remedy to stop it from happening? There's a compelling need on one 
side of people saying, "I want to hold the person calling me accountable." 
</P>
<P>
McEldowney: There are several different levels at which Number ID raises 
privacy issues. One is that historically the phone company has placed great 
emphasis on the ability of the consumer to protect his own number. Certainly 
here in California the availability of unlisted phone numbers and prohibitions 
on the phone companies selling lists of their customers has been very strong. 
We believe that allowing Number ID to go forward without safeguards in place 
will erode the privacy elements that consumers have long taken for granted. 
</P>
<P>
Secondly, telemarketers and direct-mail people are moving from the "Dear 
Occupant" approach. They want to have very targeted marketing. They want to 
know as much as possible about somebody. Number ID makes it possible for 
companies to mesh computer bases, to trade the names of all the people who had 
called them looking for information. 
</P>
<P>
On a whole other level, it's going to have impact on battered women's shelters 
and teen-age help lines. Even if an agency publicizes that it will not display 
the phone number, it will raise that suspicion on the part of people who may be 
seeking help. A battered woman in a safe house could be making a call from a 
safe house not knowing its number is on display to someone on the other end. 
</P>
<P>
Thorman: There is no perfect solution to this privacy controversy. Who has the 
greater right to privacy varies on a call-by-call basis. The benefits of 
per-call privacy are that both the caller and the person receiving the call 
have a choice. The person making the call can say, "My privacy is important," 
and the person receiving the call says, "Am I going to take a call from someone 
who displays 'private number' there?" It's the same as someone putting their 
hand over the peephole in your front door. 
</P>
<P>
* What about the other new products? 
</P>
<P>
McEldowney: Call Trace has a lot of privacy implications to it. Part of the 
problem with it is it makes every person a cop. In Pennsylvania, some very real 
questions have been raised as to whether it violates that state's 
anti-wiretapping law. 
</P>
<P>
Thorman: Call Trace allows you to have the telephone number from the last call 
traced and stored in a database at Pacific Bell for use in legal action. The 
information is only released to law enforcement officials. You as a caller have 
the right to protect your anonymity up to the point where you violate the 
rights of the person you're calling. 
</P>
<P>
* Who will benefit most from these services? 
</P>
<P>
Thorman: Residence customers by far. From all the research I've done and radio 
talk shows I've been on lately, the majority of customers are truly excited by 
what this offers. And it's not just a yuppie thing. This demand is coming from 
every segment of the population. The services either make the phone more 
convenient, give you a greater sense of security or just give you a greater 
control over your telephone. Every group that I talk to, there's always one 
feature in there that someone says, "Gee, I could use this at home." 
</P>
<P>
McEldowney: The residential market is not going to be as strong as the phone 
company thinks. First, look at the cost. This is not going to be purchased by 
low- and moderate-income consumers. It will probably attract some middle- and 
upper-middle class people who maybe want to be more selective of the calls they 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
In a world of speed dialing, the actual phone numbers that a person would 
recognize are very limited. And it's based on a whole premise that the person 
calling you is only going to be making calls from a recognized number. We're a 
real small nonprofit, but we have six lines. I could make calls from any one of 
those six lines, from a pay phone, from a friend's house, from a business, from 
a meeting room. There is no way the person on the other end would have those 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Most people who would want that service would have an answering machine and 
would be screening their calls that way. With an answering machine, you don't 
have to recognize a person's number; you can hear the person's voice. 
</P>
<P>
The people who are going to sign up for it are shady-type retailers. A shady 
telemarketer would run a TV ad or send out a direct-mail piece that would say, 
"No obligation, call for more details." People will call not knowing that their 
phone number is being displayed, either for generation of calls or for a sucker 
list. 
</P>
<P>
* How would the products be used by businesses? 
</P>
<P>
Thorman: I have two examples. You call a pizza place like Domino's Pizza. They 
have reported they have an enormous amount of orders placed by crank callers. 
Using Number ID (in the states where it already is available) has helped them 
to reduce fraud by identifying the number of the person who is calling. 
</P>
<P>
Or businesses could program the numbers of frequent customers into their 
computers. Travel agents could just bring up accounts, ask where you're going, 
find your frequent flyer number and, boom, you're off. 
</P>
<P>
* How should these products be regulated? 
</P>
<P>
McEldowney: One of the real concerns I have, and I see a lot of parallels of 
this with 976 and 900 services, is that it is a product you don't sign up for 
and you can still be negatively impacted by. Given the whole range of things 
I've already talked about, you should have per-line and not per-call blocking, 
for free. (Per-line blocking would allow customers to prevent their numbers 
from ever being displayed, without having to dial a code before each call.) 
</P>
<P>
Thorman: I'm not sure that I recommend any new regulation. We believe that 
per-call privacy adequately protects the privacy of all customers. The safety 
and accountability provisions for this product will be the same as they are 
with all of our products. We are regulated by the PUC, and they represent 
ratepayers. They determine if consumers rights are being protected adequately.

USE OF TECHNICIANS WOULD FREE PHARMACISTS TO SPEND MORE TIME AS CUSTOMER 
ADVOCATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harry Bernstein takes a common sense approach ("Prescription for Pharmacist 
Shortage," Feb. 6) by advocating wider use of technicians in pharmacies. While 
this measure alone will not solve the current national pharmacist shortage, it 
would certainly help. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the use of pharmacy technicians has not been allowed in California 
in any setting other than a hospital. A recently adopted Board of Pharmacy 
regulatory amendment would change that, if approved by the state Office of 
Administrative Law. We have used pharmacy technicians successfully in hospitals 
for years, and I think other pharmacy practice settings would benefit from 
their use as well. 
</P>
<P>
One important reason for using pharmacy technicians is to make the pharmacist 
more accessible to patients. Pharmacists have a professional obligation to 
promote safe and effective use of drugs. This requires that they counsel 
patients on the appropriate use of their prescription medication and make 
themselves available to answer questions that patients may have about their 
prescriptions. It is difficult for pharmacists to meet this responsibility if 
they personally have to perform all the steps involved in filling a 
prescription. That's where technicians come in. 
</P>
<P>
We encourage your readers to think of their pharmacists -- whether in the 
community pharmacy or in the hospital -- as their advocates in all matters 
related to drug therapy. We're here to help, and we want to.

There was one ingredient missing in Bernstein's excellent column. The only 
pharmacy school in all of Southern California is a private one, the University 
of Southern California. Although it is highly rated, it is unbelievable that 
such a largely populated area does not have one state college or university 
that offers a low-tuition pharmacy school.

DREXEL STILL HAS A MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO MILKEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I hope (Drexel Burnham Lambert Chief Executive) Fred Joseph intends to fulfill 
his moral responsibility to Michael Milken by at least personally footing his 
legal bills. After all, it was Joseph who made the decision to buckle under to 
the government's demands, shutting out Milken, far and away the company's most 
productive and valuable employee. 
</P>
<P>
One didn't have to be blessed with second sight to know that when the Drexel 
doors closed on Milken, it was only a matter of time before the doors would 
close on Drexel itself. 
</P>
<P>
The awful twist is that Joseph got to where he did -- to a position of power 
and wealth -- because of Milken, and Milken has ended up where he is -- 
fighting for his life -- because of Joseph.

ROGER SIMON: TUMULTUOUS LOVE-HATE AFFAIR TRAPS A LITTLE GIRL IN THE MIDDLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROGER SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
America's Odd Couple are at it again. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Morgan and Eric Foretich were divorced in 1982, but they are linked 
together today by bonds stronger than their marriage ever was. 
</P>
<P>
They are linked by their love for their daughter, Hilary, and their hatred for 
each other. It is anybody's guess which bond is stronger. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, though, these emotions are two sides of the same coin. In ugly 
custody fights, to deprive the other side of the child becomes as important as 
getting the child yourself. 
</P>
<P>
That's because the child is not only an object of your love, but a weapon with 
which to wound your opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan was given custody of Hilary and Foretich was given visitation rights. 
But Morgan refused to allow such visitation, saying Foretich sexually abused 
the child. 
</P>
<P>
Foretich denied it and a court supported him, ordering Morgan to produce Hilary 
for visits. Morgan refused, hid the child and went to jail for 25 months. Only 
an act of Congress, hurriedly signed by George Bush -- Morgan has many rich and 
powerful friends -- got her out. 
</P>
<P>
But Morgan still refused to produce the child. She said she would keep Hilary's 
whereabouts a secret until Hilary was 18. Recently, however, Hilary was 
discovered living in New Zealand with Morgan's parents. 
</P>
<P>
While the case is dramatic, it is not unique. Custody battles with accusations 
of child abuse are not uncommon. As others have noted, such accusations are the 
"nuclear weapon" of child custody cases. 
</P>
<P>
And it is a weapon that gets immediate attention and a lot of support for 
whoever raises it. 
</P>
<P>
The difference in the Morgan-Foretich case is the wealth of the people involved 
-- both are doctors and the case has already cost more than $2 million -- and 
the media savvy of both sides. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan and Foretich have given scores of interviews and have even debated on 
"Nightline." They have their strategies worked out and their lines down pat, 
and each knows how to say vile things about the other and appear reasonable 
while doing so. 
</P>
<P>
One sign of Morgan's skill at media manipulation is how much support she has 
received for holding herself above the law. 
</P>
<P>
This is a country where we like to believe that nobody, even the highest public 
official, is above the law. We have the Watergate scandal and the Iran-Contra 
mess to testify to that. 
</P>
<P>
But Morgan defied a lawful order of a court and still became a hero to many. 
She said she had to do it to protect her child. But people who think they are 
above the law always have good excuses. Ollie North said he was trying to 
protect democracy itself. 
</P>
<P>
(Ironically, Morgan's lawyer, Stephen Sachs, is the same man who in 1968 
prosecuted and sent to prison nine Roman Catholics, including two priests, who 
destroyed draft records in Catonsville, Md., as a matter of conscience. Sachs 
said at that time that nobody had the right "to take the law into their own 
hands." He said he found such actions "offensive." He does not, however, find 
Morgan's actions offensive.) 
</P>
<P>
The case is now lost in a blizzard of accusations. It has replaced the War 
Between the Trumps in the headlines. There are now even accusations about the 
grandfather who is taking care of Hilary in New Zealand. The lawyer appointed 
by the court in Washington to protect Hilary's interests says the grandfather 
is "extremely unstable" and could be "a danger to Hilary's best interests." 
</P>
<P>
And the grandfather did not help things when he made an ugly racial statement 
about the judge who sent his daughter to jail. 
</P>
<P>
None of this can be good for Hilary. And a New Zealand court has pledged to do 
what is best for the child. 
</P>
<P>
But who cares what the New Zealand court does? If Morgan is willing to defy a 
United States court because its ruling did not please her, what makes anyone 
think she will follow the ruling of a New Zealand court? 
</P>
<P>
And who says two will not play this game? If Morgan can defy a court order and 
get public support, what is to stop Foretich from trying it? 
</P>
<P>
That is the trouble with holding yourself above the law: The only boundary is 
your own conscience. And that can leave a very wide playing field. 
</P>
<P>
The most optimistic thing you can now say about this whole sad affair is that 
children are wonderfully resilient. Other children have survived worse than 
this and we can hope that Hilary will not only endure, but prevail. 
</P>
<P>
Personally, I wish Hilary could be taken from all her relatives and be given a 
new identity like the people in the federal Witness Protection Program. I'll 
bet there are hundreds of couples across America who could raise this child 
better than anyone currently involved. 
</P>
<P>
The parents, of course, would not like it. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan would scream and holler and call names and go to the media. 
</P>
<P>
Foretich would scream and holler and call names and go to the media. 
</P>
<P>
So there may be another possibility. Maybe these two will reconcile. 
</P>
<P>
After all, they have so much in common.

ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE ON 'RODEO WEEKENDS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Laurie Schenden's article, "Cowboys Saddle Up for 2 Rodeo Weekends" (Feb. 17), 
amounted to an advertisement that glorified the cruel "sport" of rodeo. The 
article never told your readers that bucking broncos buck because they are made 
to wear bucking straps that contain sharp metal studs that cause the animals 
enormous pain; nor that animals are moved about behind the scene by use of 
cattle prods that torture them with strong electrical shocks; nor that no 
veterinarians are on hand to help injured animals, such as calves who suffer 
painful neck injuries in the calf roping contests.

QUESTIONABLE STYLE OF SOVIET CHIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some of the Soviet-inspired fashion items mentioned in "Bloc Busters" by 
Rose-Marie Turk (Feb. 23) are indications of some very sick minds. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, I am referring to Harvey Russack and his Unique Clothing 
Warehouse using Soviet prison uniforms to make a fashion statement. 
</P>
<P>
My parents were both sent to Russian slave labor camps during the 1940s -- 
where they both perished -- so don't blame me for not getting exactly 
enthusiastic about this extremely insensitive way of making a "fashion 
statement." I bet Russack thinks this is all very funky and humorous.

ZAN THOMPSON: A LOOK BEHIND THE NAME IN LIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Kirby was sitting at the piano in front of a window. It was raining, as it does 
in the San Fernando Valley, as if it would not stop until water reached the 
windowsills. There was a fireplace with a soft fire gossiping to itself and the 
scent of the rain. 
</P>
<P>
Kirby Tepper's parents weren't home, and Kirby was entertaining himself and me 
by playing the piano. He played an insistent melody, with the refrain picking 
up the counterpoints of the rain and the fire. "What's that, Kirby?" I asked 
after awhile. He said, "Oh, nothing. I'm just noodling." 
</P>
<P>
It was the kind of melody scrap that hurts like a half-forgotten love you 
thought was safely laid to rest. 
</P>
<P>
I thought to myself that Kirby, then about 16, had a pouch full of gifts. The 
kid could dance, sing, compose, play the piano like an angel. He is the son of 
very high-test friends of mine, his father a trial lawyer and his mother a 
television executive, and I have rejoiced in their friendship for more than 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Kirby, even at 16, had the effortless style of a seasoned pro, the kind of 
presentation that is seldom in place until it has been shined and molded by 
nights without end in front of an audience. 
</P>
<P>
I saw him again the other night at the Cinegrill. When we turned the corner to 
the parking lot, I saw the name Kirby Tepper in lights on the sign on top of 
the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. I screamed with delight. He has a nightclub act, 
with songs he has written, tongue-in-cheek songs, love songs. 
</P>
<P>
Since that rainy afternoon when I knew that Kirby was gifted with a large load 
of talent, he has done the pro forma internship. He made the pilgrimage to New 
York and landed a job in the revival of "On Your Toes," directed by its 
originator, George Abbott, one of the revered names in musical comedy history. 
It was the year Abbott received the Kennedy Center honors for his body of work. 
So the show ran for a couple of weeks in Washington, D.C., and then went to 
Broadway, where it ran for a year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
Then Kirby came back to Los Angeles and continued to study his craft. He wrote 
and was the linchpin in a show called, "Back Home -- A Los Angeles Musical," at 
the Cast Theater in Hollywood. Kirby closed the show after six months because 
he wanted to do other things, and every week of its run, "Back Home" was named 
Critics' Choice for Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
I asked him the other day what was the toughest material to write. He looked at 
me as if I were speaking Urdu. "It isn't hard," he said. "It all comes easy. I 
love to do the comic songs and have the people laugh. It's like doing a comic 
scene." 
</P>
<P>
He has been commissioned to write numbers for other performers, which he also 
likes to do. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Simon, brother of the icon Neil Simon, worked with Kirby on writing 
comedy. 
</P>
<P>
The act opens with a song called, "Don't You Just Love It Here," a paean to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The pace and feeling change with a song about two people in love who then look 
at each other and realize there is nothing there but a bittersweet fragrance in 
the air. He calls it, "What Happened This Time." Kirby is joined for this and 
other numbers by singer Kimberlee Baxter. 
</P>
<P>
Kirby does a good-natured send-up of Michael Feinstein, playing the piano 
thumpingly and hitting some fractured glissandos and vocal clinkers. 
</P>
<P>
One of his songs is, "The Girl With Her Hair in a Bun," which is a study of 
every toplofty ballerina who ever looked down her delicate nose at any other 
kind of dancing. 
</P>
<P>
Kirby does a comedy song on the Santa Fe-Sedona craze, which caused perfectly 
sane people to do their houses in desert colors with replicas of Indian 
cliff-dweller ladders reaching up to nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
His accompanist for the evening is a young man named David Holcenberg. 
</P>
<P>
He will appear at the Cinegrill again toward the end of summer, and he will 
return to the Gardenia, a Hollywood nightclub that has sent forth a number of 
performers. 
</P>
<P>
When I saw him at the Cinegrill, I thought of that young boy sitting at the 
piano on a rainy afternoon, "just noodling." Now his name is in lights.

CANCELLATION OF SEASON WAS AN INTERNAL FAILURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Regional Arts Foundation of Long Beach announced earlier this year 
that it was canceling the three-play series it had planned for the 862-seat 
Center Theatre at the Long Beach Convention and Entertainment Center -- 
effectively wiping out the Long Beach Repertory Theatre before it started -- it 
placed responsibility on outside forces. 
</P>
<P>
Foundation General Manager Steven McCarthy blamed the cancellation on poor 
response to a direct mail subscription campaign (1,200 yeas out of 128,000 
solicitations) and cited the foundation's failure to match a $100,000 challenge 
grant offered by members of its own board -- a failure that foundation Chairman 
Harry Newman attributed to "too many worthy charitable and cultural causes 
chasing too few dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Problem or symptom? 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the cancellation, the first show -- Mayo Simon's "Elaine's 
Daughter" -- was about to go into rehearsal. According to director Shashin 
Desai, casting was verbally and/or contractually in place. Set designs were 
complete. Everything was in place -- except the money. 
</P>
<P>
The budget for that first production was $110,000, or roughly the same amount 
that was spent in the pre-opening marketing and fund-raising campaign, 
according to McCarthy's figures. Considerable for a campaign that consisted of 
one brochure and two mailings. 
</P>
<P>
While on the surface the canceling of a season for lack of dollars seems 
fiscally sound, this one was more like the retreat of an agency that, over the 
years, has shown little ability to fulfill its stated, twofold mission: to 
increase the potential audience for the arts in the Long Beach region and to 
establish a permanent theatrical activity in the Center Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the Long Beach Opera, very little of a theatrical nature has taken 
place in the center in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
It is not as though it was proposing to go out on a limb. Desai runs a 
successful, award-winning small professional theater, the International City 
Theatre, on the campus of Long Beach City College. He has done so since 1985. 
Following "Elaine's Daughter," he had planned a revival of Paul Osborne's 1939 
comedy, "Mornings at Seven," and Kevin Heelan's "Distant Fires," a 1988 hit at 
ICT. 
</P>
<P>
It was nothing dangerous or outrageous, but nothing dishonorable either. What 
it showed was an artistic director proceeding with caution in relatively 
uncharted waters offering "audience-friendly" shows. And rightly so. Previous 
theatrical ventures in the Center Theatre had not prospered, after all. Herb 
Rogers' 1978 season barely broke even and Norman Twain's in 1979 lost money. 
But if the mandate was to fill an empty theater, it was wise to engage a 
company with a decent track record in Long Beach. So why the 11th-hour failure 
of nerve? 
</P>
<P>
Susan Rafferty, a former acting executive director for the foundation who came 
aboard for six months in 1987 to do a feasibility study, had been the first to 
propose Desai. The board, she said, had bought her suggestions. "I can't 
believe they came this far and gave it all up," she said. "No way should they 
have expected to break even in the first season. They never knew how 
well-positioned they were for this opening. My sense, because I live in an 
adjacent community and get every solicitation from Long Beach, is that they 
really didn't market it." 
</P>
<P>
Or at least not enough. Even Paul Berg, executive vice president of the 
foundation board, who voted for the cancellation, acknowledged that the 
marketing campaign could have been more aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
Berg, who also said he was personally disappointed in the outcome, believed in 
retrospect that the cancellation might have been "overcautious." "It has always 
been my contention," he said, "that you have to tell people exactly what you 
want money for before you can raise it." 
</P>
<P>
Putting on that first play would have told people what the foundation wanted 
money for. It would have shown spirit and confidence. And a deeply needed 
commitment. If more community support were not forthcoming, there would have 
been time to warn the public that the rest of the season might not make it. But 
the door would have been opened and left ajar. 
</P>
<P>
The people of Long Beach do have to let their wishes be known. There cannot be 
an equity theater in that city if there is no will among its citizens to have 
one. 
</P>
<P>
Newman and McCarthy contend that Long Beach is not ready. Desai and others, 
including Berg ("We're starving for it here") and Councilman Evan Anderson 
Braude, in whose district the Convention and Entertainment Center sits, contend 
it is. 
</P>
<P>
"They sent out literature, but didn't follow it up with phone calls," Braude 
said. "You have to work people." 
</P>
<P>
Who's right? And will there be a way to find out?

REPERTORY THEATER SEASON CANCELED BUT WRITER HAS NO REGRETS; 
</P>
<P>
STAGE: PLAYWRIGHT MAYO SIMON HAS HAD A HARD YEAR -- HIS WORKS HAVE DIED 
OFFSTAGE, HIS CALLS ARE NOT BEING RETURNED -- BUT HE IS PHILOSOPHICAL ABOUT IT 
ALL. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
This week, you will not enter the new Center Theatre of the Long Beach 
Convention and Entertainment Center. There, you will not witness the Southern 
California premiere of "Elaine's Daughter." 
</P>
<P>
In January -- after announcing an ambitious new season of plays by a new 
company of players, the Long Beach Repertory Theater, after mailing flyers 
inviting season subscriptions sales, after casting the actors, designers, 
director -- the Long Beach Regional Arts Foundation pulled the plug. Everything 
-- premiere, gala, season -- sank, canceled for lack of finances. 
</P>
<P>
And the playwright? In the wake of his non-opening, how is Mayo Simon handling 
disappointment? Is he in intensive therapy? Is he peering at the bottom of a 
long weekend's whiskey glass? 
</P>
<P>
Calmly, philosophically, the playwright answered: "I've been reviewing the last 
year of my life." 
</P>
<P>
By others' standards, it was not a very good year. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the cancellation of "Elaine's Daughter," 1989-90 saw Simon's previous 
play, "These Men," rejected for a Paris production because of its "vulgar 
language." Now its English opening has been delayed so often by London's 
leading fringe theater, The King's Head, that, Simon said: "I'm beginning to 
think it will never open." The Philadelphia Theatre Company, while negotiating 
with Simon a commission for a new play, went out of business. New York's Public 
Theater, supposedly committed to a staged reading of Simon's latest work, 
"Angel," suddenly is not returning telephone calls. And a Broadway option on 
"Elaine's Daughter" just lapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Pass the hemlock? Not for Simon. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a year in which everything has collapsed around me," he said. 
"But I feel pretty good because for the first year in over 30 years of being a 
writer, I can now get up in the morning and write exactly what I want to." 
</P>
<P>
That is because Simon has done the unthinkable in Hollywood: turn his back on a 
lucrative film and television career to write plays full time. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Simon, and his wife, Sondra, decided to sell their 11-room French 
country chateau in Pacific Palisades to finance a change in career. They were 
encouraged by their children. Joel, an Internal Revenue Service accountant, and 
Rafael, a UC Berkeley graduate student, viewed the home as merely a financial 
asset. Their daughters, Anne, a University of Massachusetts molecular 
biologist, and Francesca, a London play scout for the Mark Taper Forum, "gently 
pushed us in the direction of selling the house. 
</P>
<P>
"I got all that money and bought a much smaller four-room house nearby in 
Pacific Palisades," Simon said. "Now I don't have money problems and no longer 
have to do television and films. Selling that house at the top of the real 
estate market is the one thing this year that really worked out." 
</P>
<P>
Even if all his play plans had materialized, Simon estimated that he would have 
made only $20,000 for the entire year -- less than half his pay for a half-hour 
television pilot. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider $20,000 a lot of money now," said Simon, 61. "When you're young, it 
doesn't matter what you write. A half-hour comedy pilot? Wonderful. Big movie? 
Terrific! Whether they make it or not, it's all fun. But after a certain point, 
when you write a thing that's really good and they don't make it, you say, 
'I've wasted a year on this project. I don't care what money I earned, I can't 
get that year back. That year is gone.' So $60,000 is not good money anymore. 
When you're 30 it's wonderful. When you're 60 it's not good money." 
</P>
<P>
His self-imposed Hollywood exile is frequently put to the test. An independent 
film producer recently telephoned about a movie-of-the-week treatment Simon 
wrote 10 years ago. "I can sell it now," the producer said, "your concept's 
hot!" Simon offered only the treatment, refusing to write the screenplay 
despite the offer of a high fee. 
</P>
<P>
"It would take a year to write the script," Simon said of the proposed 
television movie, "and then it would probably never get made. Getting 
well-produced in a 99-seat theater in front of an audience that appreciates 
what you've written is very satisfying. When something you've done is 
successful on television, nobody but your wife knows you've done it." 
</P>
<P>
Simon remembers when he first realized the Hollywood writer's actual status 
within the industry. It was 1967, during the star-studded premiere of 
"Marooned" at the Egyptian Theater on Hollywood Boulevard. He had worked three 
well-paid years writing the space epic, his first major writing job since 
coming to Los Angeles in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1950s in New York, as a live television writer for "Studio One" and 
"Playhouse 90," executives and craftsmen had treated Simon like -- well, like a 
playwright. So, at his first big Hollywood premiere, he anticipated similar 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
After taking his seat in the Egyptian, Simon opened the studio's glossy color 
brochure. On the first page were listed "the creators" of "Marooned": the 
producer and the director. Then Simon found page after page on the stars of 
"Marooned." Then more pages on the special effects personnel. Where was the 
writer? Finally, at the back of the brochure, alongside the assistant director 
and the assistant cameraman, he found his name. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, prior to that Hollywood opening, Simon had enjoyed his first major 
theatrical premiere with "Walking to Waldheim" at New York's Lincoln Center. 
But at that time in his life the stage was not a serious temptation. 
</P>
<P>
The critics slammed the play. And he had just written an Oscar-winning 
documentary, "Why Man Creates." He remembers the studios called him "a very 
promising up-and-coming motion picture writer." 
</P>
<P>
But screenwriters were second-class citizens, mechanics for hire. His work on 
Judy Garland's last movie, "I Could Wake Up Singing," became "a ghastly 
nightmare": his secret rewritings of a writer were being secretly rewritten by 
yet a third writer. 
</P>
<P>
And Simon said he has watched it get worse, not better. For the Writers Guild, 
Simon recently sat on a panel arbitrating screenplay credit for a film. There 
were 21 scripts by eight writers -- for the same movie. This horrifies Simon, 
who apprenticed under the late Robert Penn Warren, the American poet laureate, 
at the University of Minnesota and who brings an almost religious devotion to 
his work. Writing, for Simon, is a literary act of faith, a profound gesture 
toward "communication and insight." 
</P>
<P>
So in the 1970s, seeking artistic satisfaction, Simon began to use Hollywood as 
the financial backer of his plays. He would average a year and a half creating 
"The Man From Atlantis" for NBC or writing a film such as "Future World." Then 
for the next year and a half he would live off the industry profits while 
writing a play. 
</P>
<P>
But it was always difficult to make the transition between screen and stage, 
sometimes requiring two or three months before he could think in the opposite 
genre's terms. "For a film, your point of view is extremely flexible," he said. 
"The audience wants everything shown. But on a stage, you tend not to show what 
you're talking about. A theater audience is much readier to go with its 
imagination than a film audience. The stage is filled with what you imagine." 
</P>
<P>
The play, "These Men," in 1980 made Simon reassess his double creative life. 
The play examined how the feminist revolution changed women's sexual lives. 
Before its off-Broadway production, producer Fred Coe took Simon out to a 
business lunch and asked him, "How would you like your characters costumed?" 
</P>
<P>
Simon was stunned. 
</P>
<P>
"I was coming from Hollywood where they're not interested in the writer's views 
on costumes," Simon said, "or on anything else. I didn't know what to say. Then 
he said, 'Well, Pappy, you're the boss.' This was not said ironically. He was 
dead serious. They were there to please me. I had been a writer for 20 years in 
television and film; never once had a producer turned to see what I thought of 
an actor. It was a very heady experience." 
</P>
<P>
Then when Simon studied the contract for "These Men," he realized that, unlike 
screenplay contracts, he was the author. No one could touch his play without 
his permission. In Hollywood, every contract made the buyer the author, while 
writers became paid employees. 
</P>
<P>
Although "These Men" was savaged by the New York critics, a revised version at 
London's Bush Theater in 1981 became a sensational hit. In 1985, the Los 
Angeles Theater Center premiered "A Rich Full Life," his contemporary sequel to 
"A Doll's House." 
</P>
<P>
Simon continued his difficult transitions between mediums. He forged a 
collaborative relationship with director Jules Aaron, who guided "Elaine's 
Daughter" into the 1987 Actors Theatre of Louisville's Humana Festival of New 
American plays. There Simon began thinking the unthinkable: entirely severing 
his Hollywood involvements. 
</P>
<P>
His first day at Louisville, Artistic Director Jon Jory called everyone 
involved with the festival to a meeting. Jory announced that he wanted to 
introduce the stars of the festival. Simon looked around, thinking, "Oh, have 
the stars arrived?" Then Jory began introducing the writers. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe it," Simon said. "I wanted to run up and hug and kiss him." 
</P>
<P>
"Elaine's Daughter" became the hit of the festival. The New York Times called 
it "the brightest play of the weekend, a sharp-sighted little comedy about a 
generational conflict between opposites." 
</P>
<P>
"I made $284 for 13 performances in a theater that seated 174 people," Simon 
said of his Louisville festival experience. "And it was the best five weeks I 
ever had. I wouldn't trade it for anything. It was my play -- the way I'd 
written it -- beautifully done up on the stage for a great audience, with 30 
critics from all over the country saying 'this is terrific.' I wouldn't give 
that up for anything." 
</P>
<P>
Then came the Long Beach reversal. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago I would have been devastated by this," Simon said. "But I've had 
so many of these things happen to me that it doesn't make any difference now. 
These disappointments don't keep me from enjoying my life as a playwright. At 
Louisville, everybody said 'Elaine's Daughter' will go to Broadway. It didn't 
-- maybe it never will. I mean, it didn't even go to Long Beach!"

MURRAY RAPS POLL RANKING HIM AS WORST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Assemblyman Willard H. Murray Jr. (D-Paramount) branded as "ludicrous" a 
magazine poll published last week that rated him the state's worst assemblyman. 
</P>
<P>
"The magazine failed to note . . . my supportive voting record on women's 
issues, environmental concerns, child-care needs, among many other issues," 
Murray said in a three-page statement. "Nor did the magazine mention my superb 
attendance and voting records," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The California Journal, a Sacramento-based political magazine, takes the poll 
annually, rating legislators from the best to the worst in terms of integrity, 
intelligence, energy and effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
To come up with its ratings each year, the Journal surveys legislative staff 
members, lobbyists and journalists, as well as legislators themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Bill Greene (D-Los Angeles), who also represents several Southeast cities, 
received the lowest rating for a state senator other than former Sen. Joseph B. 
Montoya, who resigned last month rather than face possible expulsion as a 
result of his conviction on political corruption charges. Montoya resigned 
after the survey was taken but before it was published. 
</P>
<P>
Murray, a former political consultant and aide to Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally 
(D-Compton), is seeking his second term in the Legislature. The Journal, Murray 
complained in his statement, based its ratings on a return rate of only 14% of 
the 1,570 surveys it distributed. Also, he said, the Journal has never 
highlighted the legislation he carried. 
</P>
<P>
"These measures included methods to reduce crime, to sweep more criminals off 
of the streets, to help veterans, and bills to help youth build a brighter 
future for themselves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Murray complained, too, that the Journal staff did not go with him to his 
district to visit drug-infested neighborhoods, churches and senior centers and 
watch "me serve and interact with the homeless families." Journal staff, he 
said, just spent time with him in the Capitol. In addition to Paramount, 
Murray's 54th District takes in Compton, Lakewood, Paramount, Bellflower and 
the northern edge of Long Beach.

</P>
<P>
LA HABRA HEIGHTS: DEVELOPED AS AN AGRICULTURAL AREA, THE LARGE LOTS APPEAL TO 
EQUESTRIANS AND OTHERS WHO LIKE THE WIDE OPEN SPACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIAN BOND, Bond is a free-lance writer who has lived in La Habra Heights 
for 18 years. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul and Claire Spothelfer first came to La Habra Heights in 1982, when they 
were shopping for a horse. They lived in Downey, but had their three horses 
boarded elsewhere and were also looking for horse property to buy. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Spothelfer thought the Heights might be the place for them. Although 
Claire was intimidated by the hilly terrain and narrow roads, they found the 
ideal home. 
</P>
<P>
"There was the horse setup with a barn, hot walker and arena, a house that was 
the right size and a spectacular view," Claire said. "We took to it 
immediately." 
</P>
<P>
Today, she is just finishing her term as president of the La Habra Heights 
Improvement Assn. Her husband is a general contractor in the area. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra Heights, in southeast Los Angeles County, is a city of more than 5,400 
residents covering 6.2 square miles surrounded by Whittier, Hacienda Heights, 
unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County and La Habra, in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The city was incorporated in 1978, but the La Habra Heights Improvement Assn. 
has been in existence since 1937 and for years served as the voice of the 
people in the Heights, Claire Spothelfer said. 
</P>
<P>
The association's main purpose was to maintain the rural life style of the area 
as well as low-density housing. With incorporation, the city was able to ensure 
1-acre minimum zoning, or more in the case of extreme slopes. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1920s and 1930s La Habra Heights developed as an agricultural area, and 
a 1930 survey showed there were 1,292 acres of avocado orchards, 282 acres of 
orange, lemon and citron orchards and 43 acres of miscellaneous plantings. 
</P>
<P>
There were also 95 homes, a mix of weekend cottages and large Spanish-style 
homes for show business personalities and oil barons. A 1920s National 
Geographic article described La Habra Heights as one of the "three most 
beautiful living spots in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Today many of the older homes remain, and the city abounds with old orchards as 
well as flowering eucalyptus, blue gum and acacia trees. 
</P>
<P>
The area has remained rural, and horsemanship has been an important element of 
life in the Heights. Horses are kept by many residents, and there are two 
riding rings available and access to trails. 
</P>
<P>
The city is also overwhelmingly residential. There is no commercial retail 
zoning in the city; no stores or gas stations. Residents shop in the 
surrounding cities. 
</P>
<P>
There also are no schools, and children attend classes in either Whittier or La 
Habra. Bus service is available to some schools, but not to all. 
</P>
<P>
An exception to the city's tough zoning is the realty office of Edwin G. Hart, 
located on a corner of Hacienda Boulevard since 1946. The office has a 
nonconforming use permit until the year 2011, according to Mayor Jean Good. 
</P>
<P>
It was Hart, who in the 1920s, had a vision for La Habra Heights. Hart, who 
died in 1939, believed that the frost-free hills could be transformed into a 
remarkable avocado growing belt. He bought 3,500 acres and began marketing 
parcels as avocado ranches, and many groves remain today. 
</P>
<P>
Good, who also served as the city's first mayor in 1978, moved to La Habra 
Heights in 1968 with three young children and five quarter horses. The family 
ran Good's Western Store in Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up in Whittier," Good said, "and we had always wanted to live in the 
Heights. When we moved here we thought we had found heaven. I've never thought 
otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
Good became active in civic affairs shortly after moving to the Heights when 
she received a notice about a plan to build 50 homes on a nearby 16-acre 
parcel. She and many of her neighbors rallied together to stop that proposed 
development and have been active since in efforts to preserve the natural 
terrain and rural flavor of the community. 
</P>
<P>
The Heights' amenities make it an expensive housing market. 
</P>
<P>
The average price of homes will run between $695,000 and $795,000, said Glenda 
Tuppan, a real estate agent in the Barbara Nix office in Whittier. Tuppan has 
been a Heights resident since 1951 and has served on the City Council and as 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a time when we had 15 homes in the million-dollar bracket for sale," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"A three-bedroom house has just come on the market for $249,000," an unusual 
occurrence, she said. "An older two-bedroom is on the market for $299,500." 
Smaller two-bedroom homes that were built in the '40s will run in the low 
$300,000s, as a rule. 
</P>
<P>
The community is divided into East Heights and West Heights by Hacienda 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Joe and Karen Rakowski moved into the West Heights last summer. They paid in 
the low $300,000s for the 1,700-square-foot three-bedroom, two-bath view home 
that was built in 1933. They enjoy walking in their neighborhood as well as 
riding their bikes. 
</P>
<P>
And the Heights' wildlife especially delights the Rakowskis. 
</P>
<P>
"We have raccoons," Joe Rakowski said. "I opened the kitchen door once and 
almost stepped on one. I have sat in the yard, and they'll come within 5 feet 
of me. We've had a peacock in the yard, and we've seen guinea hens crossing the 
road." 
</P>
<P>
Before moving, the couple had a short commute to work, Karen to General 
Telephone in Downey and Joe to South Gate, where he is a production control 
manager for Anadite. Now they drive together for about 45 minutes to get to and 
from work but they don't mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I love coming home here," Joe said. 
</P>
<P>
Bud and Dottie Hynes have owned three homes in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"We paid $21,000 in 1960, and it was the least expensive house in the Heights 
at the time," Dottie said. After 10 years, they wanted a larger home and moved 
to their second Heights residence. "We lived there 18 years, and then sold and 
moved to Whittier into a house we were going to remodel." They only lived there 
five months. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember we came to a Constitution Day event the city (of La Habra Heights) 
put on and I felt like we were standing on the sidelines because we didn't live 
here any more," she recalled. "The next day we started looking for another 
house." 
</P>
<P>
That was in 1987, and they paid in the mid-$300,000 range for their 
3,100-square-foot, 4-bedroom, 3 1/2-bath home. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce and Ellen Douglas are newlyweds and also newcomers to La Habra Heights. 
</P>
<P>
When they started their house hunting there were not too many for sale in their 
price range in the high $300,000s. The 1,800-square-foot, one-bedroom house 
they found was built in 1953 and is on a half-acre. They moved in last October. 
</P>
<P>
"From the entrance, the house looks like nothing," Ellen Douglas said. "The 
street is not very appealing and not well maintained. It's hard to find parking 
on such a steeply graded area." They were not impressed until they walked into 
the house and found that it had a view that stretched to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
Crime in the community is "very, very low," said Capt. Bill Stonich of the 
sheriff's station in City of Industry, the agency that has a contract with the 
city for police protection. Traffic enforcement is the major concern, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"In La Habra Heights, you have an affluent rural type of community with a great 
deal of community involvement (and) long-term residents who look out for each 
other," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While residents are loyal to their community, there are concerns that must be 
dealt with. Many of the narrow roads are in need of repair. The two major 
arteries, Fullerton Road and Hacienda Boulevard are both scheduled for major 
improvements in the 1990s. Funds will come from federal, state and county 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Other concerns reflect the rural nature of La Habra Heights. 
</P>
<P>
Claire Spothelfer said her improvement association is concerned that too many 
residents fail to even put up their house numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"This could be vital in an emergency," she said.

SAM HALL KAPLAN: PARKING SOLUTION A TWO-WAY STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM HALL KAPLAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The car: We love it; we hate it. 
</P>
<P>
While embracing our own, we resent others for clogging the freeways, turning 
our neighborhood streets into speedways, parking in front of our house or 
condo, or in the space most convenient to our favorite stores, services and 
diversions. 
</P>
<P>
It is not surprising that accommodating the car dominates most debates over 
planning and development, be the issue a regional shopping center, a modest 
expansion of a local business, a request for restrictive parking or installing 
a stop sign or a speed bump. 
</P>
<P>
Questions on the appropriateness of proposed architectural styles might be 
interesting and, in the course of a building's life, more important. There is 
also the consideration of what needs the building might serve, and the jobs and 
revenues to be generated. 
</P>
<P>
But aesthetics and economics notwithstanding, more immediate and critical to 
the development process these days is how many parking spaces are provided and 
how the surrounding streets will handle the expected increase in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The debates seem never-ending, especially in my hometown of Santa Monica, where 
the civic stew is a spicy mix of contentiousness and pretentiousness, fired by 
ideologues of all hues. 
</P>
<P>
Just recently, a well-promoted plan for a 1.2-million-square-foot office 
complex adjacent to the Santa Monica Airport crashed after its traffic 
projections and proposed solutions were shot full of holes by a resolute 
battery of nearby residents. 
</P>
<P>
And this despite the plan having gone through a series of hoops and reviews, to 
be blessed by the city's Planning Commission and City Council, and given 
permission to land. In the end, no amount of compromise and political 
maneuverings could clear the runway. 
</P>
<P>
The latest controversy concerned a request last month for the creation of a 
permit-parking district on 17th Street, north of Montana Avenue to Alta Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The scenario there was a variation on a common complaint from residents in 
Santa Monica and elsewhere who live on streets next to commercial strips. 
</P>
<P>
From early morning to late afternoon, it seems, the parking spaces on 17th 
Street are being snapped up by Montana Avenue employees and shoppers, a 
situation heightened by the avenue's increasing popularity. 
</P>
<P>
Once simply a strip of relatively modest neighborhood-oriented establishments, 
such as drugstores, shoe repairs shops and markets, Montana from 7th to 17th 
streets now also houses a range of trendy boutiques and galleries with a 
regional appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"We sympathize with the residents, but the parking is vital, especially for the 
older establishments," said Lou Moench, of the Montana Avenue Merchants 
Committee, and owner of the popular pub Father's Office. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that most of the stores between 16th and 17th streets, some with more 
than 50 years' service to the community, don't provide parking and never have. 
They have always depended on spaces being available on adjacent streets. 
</P>
<P>
However, the situation south of Montana has long been impossible, because 
spaces there are more or less used for permanent parking by residents of local 
apartment complexes. Because most were built when no or little off-street 
parking was required, few offer it. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, many of the garages in the alleys are now used illegally for 
storage and bootleg apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Aggravating the problem north of Montana is the recent replacement there of 
existing older homes with oversized and overstuffed houses, providing at best 
minimum parking. Garages there also have been converted illegally for storage, 
home offices and staff quarters. The result is that residents tandem park in 
their driveways or on the street. 
</P>
<P>
But because of the shopper and employee parking, residents complained at the 
City Council hearing on permits, that they couldn't park in front of their own 
house, nor could their gardeners, messengers, repairmen, friends or relatives. 
</P>
<P>
As for the tandem parking, they said, it was awkward and inconvenient. 
</P>
<P>
They added that the shoppers and the employees should have to park elsewhere, 
perhaps the latter in municipal garages in downtown Santa Monica, and be bused 
to their jobs on Montana. 
</P>
<P>
The residents' comments, offered in the spirit of a Leona Helmsley charm 
school, suggested that those who work on Montana -- the clerks, the 
beauticians, the waitresses, manicurists and others who served them -- were the 
"little people." 
</P>
<P>
There also was the implication by the residents that when they bought their 
house (present prices for nouveau mansions there are $1.5 million), they got as 
a bonus the curb space in front of it. 
</P>
<P>
In reply, most of the merchants testifying reluctantly accepted the concept of 
permit parking for residents, but argued for a two-hour limit for others, to 
provide some parking for customers. 
</P>
<P>
The council opted for the permit parking for residents, with a one-hour limit 
for others, even though a few members labeled it a Band-Aid solution. "We are 
going to end up 'incrementalling' the city to death," said Councilwoman 
Christine Reed. 
</P>
<P>
But for now it appears that lunches and window-shopping on Montana for those 
who park on the side streets are going to be less leisurely. 
</P>
<P>
As for the employees, they most likely will just park on a street beyond the 
permit zone and walk a few extra blocks to work. No doubt, as a consequence, 
they will be more fit to serve the north-of-Montana crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city is exploring increasing parking requirements for both 
residential and commercial developments, and more flexible permit parking, 
including the commercial use of the streets during the day and residential use 
at night, as was recently instituted adjacent to Melrose Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
There also is talk of redesigning Montana for diagonal parking, at least on one 
side of the street, which would have the double advantage of providing more 
parking while slowing traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The avenue, which widens from two to four lanes between 7th and 20th streets, 
has become a notorious speedway, and is even listed in a book on Los Angeles 
shortcuts as a quick and easy way to get to the beach from Brentwood and 
Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
The last time diagonal parking was suggested, residents north of Montana 
complained that it was dangerous and would divert through traffic to local 
streets, such as Alta. Although it was shown how such traffic can be 
controlled, residents there are the type of people who seldom hear the word no, 
and the idea was shelved by the city. 
</P>
<P>
But now the city is armed with a thorough traffic study by the consultant firm 
of Crain &amp; Associates that suggests a variety of measures to protect 
neighborhoods from what they call "traffic intrusion." These include turn 
restrictions, diverters, one-way streets, cul-de-sacs and closures. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, parking and traffic are entwined, and that something broad and 
dramatic has to be done, particularly to protect neighborhoods," said City 
Manager John Jailli. "The problem is that whatever we come up with is going to 
inconvenience someone." 
</P>
<P>
Given the growth of Los Angeles, it is time for cars to start giving some 
ground, to be inconvenienced. 
</P>
<P>
The good life here doesn't have to mean a parking space wherever you want it, 
to zip in and out in a soundproof, climate-controlled capsulated car. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it will mean parking a few blocks away and walking along the street, 
pausing to say "hello" to your neighbors and the local merchants, and all the 
people who make a parking district and traffic zone a neighborhood.

REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: MISUNDERSTANDING THE RESIDENCE REPLACEMENT RULE CAN BE 
COSTLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: Please straighten out the conflicting advice I am receiving from my 
real estate agent and my tax preparer. I am not yet 55 and will be moving from 
a high-cost to a lower-cost area. I have about $80,000 equity in my home, which 
I plan to sell in a few months. 
</P>
<P>
After the sale, I expect to use this equity to buy a modest home for around 
$80,000 in Florida, which I will own free and clear. My real estate agent says 
I won't have to pay any tax since I am reinvesting my $80,000 equity. But my 
tax preparer says I will owe tax if I buy a less expensive home. Who is right? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Your tax preparer is right. Your real estate agent is wrong. This 
situation shows why real estate agents should not give tax advice unless they 
also are tax experts. 
</P>
<P>
However, even many tax professionals don't understand the "roll-over residence 
replacement rule" of Internal Revenue Code 1034, so don't be too harsh on your 
well-meaning realty agent. 
</P>
<P>
This tax rule says home sellers who, within 24 months before or after the sale, 
buy and occupy their replacement principal residence costing at least as much 
as the net (adjusted) sales price of their old principal residence must defer 
their profit tax. 
</P>
<P>
If a less expensive replacement principal residence is purchased, the sale 
profit becomes taxable up to the difference in the two prices. 
</P>
<P>
Please notice this rule says nothing about mortgages or equity. All that 
matters are the net adjusted sales price of the old home and the purchase price 
of the replacement home. 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate, suppose you sell your old home for $150,000 net after paying the 
sales commission and other selling expenses. That means to defer the entire tax 
on your sales profit, whatever the profit might be, within 24 months before or 
after the sale you must buy and occupy a replacement home costing at least 
$150,000, including any capital improvements you add within the 24-month 
replacement period. 
</P>
<P>
However, since you will be buying a less expensive replacement home for 
$80,000, up to $70,000 of sale profit in this example ($150,000 minus $80,000) 
will be taxable. 
</P>
<P>
As you can see, the rule is actually quite simple: Buy a more expensive 
replacement home, defer your profit tax; buy a less expensive replacement home, 
pay tax. You must report your home sale on IRS form 2119 whether or not you 
qualify for tax deferral. Your tax adviser can give you further details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Don't Try to Sell Home Without Agent 
</P>
<P>
Q: We want to sell our home without a real estate agent, so we can save the 
sales commission. Please give us your checklist for selling our home alone. 
</P>
<P>
A: There is only one item on my checklist for do-it-yourself home sellers. It 
says "Don't do it." 
</P>
<P>
Selling a home today is a complicated business. Even the best professional real 
estate agents must work extremely hard to successfully complete every sale. As 
an amateur selling just one home you are at an extreme disadvantage competing 
against agents who belong to the local multiple listing service, which has 
hundreds of listings available to show to prospective buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Frankly, I would love to encourage you to sell your home alone, so you can save 
the sales commission. But I would be doing you a disservice to recommend that 
you undertake such a task. The risks are too great for most home sellers. 
</P>
<P>
For example, did you know that if you fail to disclose known defects in your 
home the buyer can sue you for damages? Do you know how to help the buyer 
obtain mortgage financing? Do you know how to arrange title insurance? Do you 
know how to have the sale successfully closed? These are just a few of the 
potential do-it-yourself home sale problems that can arise. 
</P>
<P>
Although I am a licensed real estate broker, when I have a house to sell, 
unless I sell it to my tenant, I always list the property with a local realtor. 
Why? Because an owner cannot do an objective job of selling his own property 
without professional help. 
</P>
<P>
Before you decide to sell your home alone interview at least three local realty 
agents who sell homes in your neighborhood. Ask them to give you their listing 
presentations. Inquire about their fees, services and anything else you want to 
know. Each agent should give you a written, competitive market analysis form 
showing recent sales prices and current asking prices of similar nearby homes, 
as well as the agent's recommended asking price for your home. 
</P>
<P>
After each agent has departed, phone their client references of recent sellers 
to ask, "Were you in any way unhappy with the agent's service and would you 
list another property for sale with this agent again?" I think you will 
conclude you need a professional agent's help to sell your home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Homeowner Can't Be Forced Into Selling 
</P>
<P>
Q: Our real estate agent showed us a home listed in the multiple listing book. 
The price was reasonable and it said the seller would finance the sale with a 
15% cash down payment. We made a full-price purchase offer with 15% down 
payment. 
</P>
<P>
There were no contingencies in our offer because we knew it was a bargain. But 
the seller refused to accept. The agent said the seller had changed her mind 
about selling, but the agent was as mad as we were. We talked to our lawyer, 
but she says there is nothing we can do since we are not minorities and cannot 
charge racial discrimination. Do you agree? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. A property seller cannot be forced to sell just because the property 
was listed for sale with a real estate agent. An advertisement in a newspaper 
or the local multiple listing service book is only an invitation for bids at 
the asking price. However, if the seller had accepted your offer and then 
refused to perform, you could bring a specific performance lawsuit to force the 
seller to honor the sales contract terms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Property Manager Caught in the Middle 
</P>
<P>
Q: For the last three years I have been resident manager of an 80-unit 
apartment complex. I enjoy the job very much, especially meeting the prospects, 
renting apartments and even handling their complaints. I get a free apartment 
plus a modest salary. As I have a real estate broker's license I am thinking of 
becoming a professional property manager and opening my own management firm. Do 
you think this is a good idea? 
</P>
<P>
A: In my humble opinion, the world's most difficult and thankless job is 
professional property management. I greatly admire those who enjoy such work. 
</P>
<P>
Property managers are middlemen between landlords and tenants. From the 
landlord's view the rents are too low and the expenses are too high. From the 
tenant's view, the rents are too high and the service is inadequate. The 
property manager is caught in the middle. Before you decide to open your own 
property management company, I suggest you work as a property supervisor for a 
property management company. Then you can decide if you really enjoy being a 
middleman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Minimum Period for Listing Home Sale 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is it true that six months is the minimum term for listing a home for sale 
with a real estate agent? That's what a real estate agent told me. She said the 
local multiple listing service requires 180-day listings. But I find that hard 
to believe. 
</P>
<P>
A: There is no minimum listing term for property listings. I've seen listings 
as short as 24 hours. However, that was for unlisted property on which the 
agent had a purchase offer and he wanted the commission agreement in writing 
before presenting the purchase offer. 
</P>
<P>
The listing term can be whatever the seller and agent agree upon. I suggest the 
listing term be not more than 90 days. Some sellers, like me, prefer 30- to 
60-day listings because they motivate the agent to get the property sold 
quickly. Another alternative is to sign a 90-day listing with a clause allowing 
cancellation without cost upon 30 days notice to the agent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Should Home Buyer Know Reason for Sale? 
</P>
<P>
Q: My wife and I are looking at homes to buy. We saw one last weekend where I 
asked the agent why the seller is selling. She said it was none of my business. 
I courteously explained that I wanted to know, so we could make an offer 
meeting the seller's time requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The agent replied that the seller was flexible about when she could move out. 
The next day I phoned a realty agent who has shown us many houses to get her 
opinion of the house with the rude realty agent. She told me the house is in 
foreclosure and will soon be going up for auction. Don't you think the sales 
agent should have told us that? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. The foreclosure sale is a material fact that the buyer should know 
about because it affects the availability of the home for sale and the terms 
that the seller can accept. It is unfortunate the first agent tried to conceal 
that important fact from you. As a result, the house probably won't sell soon 
enough to avoid loss by foreclosure. If the agent had honestly disclosed the 
reason for the sale, perhaps you could have made a purchase offer to save the 
house from foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pros and Cons of a Quitclaim Deed 
</P>
<P>
Q: While on a winter ski vacation we looked at some ski cabins for sale. One is 
being sold to settle a divorce. The price is a bargain. But it is being sold by 
the husband who says he and his wife will give us a quitclaim deed and we can 
take over their mortgage. I have never heard of a quitclaim deed. Is it safe? 
</P>
<P>
A: A quitclaim deed conveys whatever interest the grantor owns in the property. 
You could receive full fee simple absolute title. Or you could receive nothing 
if the grantor doesn't own marketable title to the property. 
</P>
<P>
For example, I could give you a quitclaim deed to the Empire State Building in 
New York City. However, you would be receiving nothing but a worthless piece of 
paper, since I don't own that building. To protect yourself when receiving a 
quitclaim deed, be sure also to obtain an owner's title insurance policy. Then 
you will be well protected. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interview Competition to Find a Good Agent 
</P>
<P>
Q: I agree with your suggestion to interview at least three real estate agents 
before listing with the best one. 
</P>
<P>
However, we had a problem choosing three agents to interview because we knew 
only one. 
</P>
<P>
While we were interviewing her, I asked, "Which agents do you consider your 
toughest and best competition?" She named several very successful agents with 
other firms. After the first agent left, I called two of these agents and we 
interviewed them. As a result, we selected one who is the top sales agent in 
our town. 
</P>
<P>
She was a real crackerjack. Even has a nice personal secretary who took care of 
many of the details, such as advising us which moving company was best. Perhaps 
you can use my idea of asking one agent for the names of their toughest 
competitors to find other agents to interview. 
</P>
<P>
A: Thanks for your great idea. Of course, it could have backfired if the first 
agent named some really bad agents who, by comparison, would make the first 
agent look terrific. 
</P>
<P>
You also brought up another indicator of top agents, a personal assistant. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the most successful real estate agents now have one or more personal 
assistants or secretaries so the agent can devote most of his/her time to 
listing and selling, rather than to detail work.

10 RULES FOR LIVING WITH A 'FOR SALE' SIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON L. WARZOCHA, Warzocha is a Valencia free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your life is perfect with one minor exception -- there is a 2-by-3-foot wooden 
sign stuck into the front lawn that reads, "For Sale, Wescott Realty, 555-2000, 
By Appointment Only." 
</P>
<P>
The addition of that sign to your landscape can turn an ordinary household into 
a frenzied one, because there are no secrets from prospective home buyers, and 
no time of day is exempt from invasion. You and your home are constantly on 
display. 
</P>
<P>
There are steps you can take to prepare for the experience that will help you 
to keep your blood pressure at a medically acceptable level while your home is 
"on the market." 
</P>
<P>
1 -- You must eat, breathe and think like Mrs. Clean. No longer can you collect 
dirty laundry on the bedposts, under the coffee table or on the bottom shelf of 
the kitchen pantry. 
</P>
<P>
You must load and unload the dishwasher promptly. Nothing makes a kitchen look 
smaller than the debris of dirty dishes, unscoured pots and pans, and used 
glasses. The prospective buyer is unlikely to believe you are preparing for a 
dishwasher detergent commercial to begin shooting at any moment. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't have a dishwasher, stock up on paper plates, plastic silverware 
and glasses, and quit using the real things. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- Always make the bed. You can save time by not changing the sheets, and no 
one will ever know. Wake up family members if you have to, or make the bed up 
over them. So what, if it's lumpy; it will still look better than looking at 
rumpled linen. 
</P>
<P>
3 -- Send your children for extended visits with out-of-town relatives. 
Although the sight of toothpaste dabs in the sink used to be signs of 
encouragement to you, at least it proved they were brushing, seeing them now 
may trigger a migraine. 
</P>
<P>
A teen-ager's stroll through the house can leave a trail that resembles the 
path of a hurricane; a 3-year-old can single-handedly reverse the effects of an 
entire day of house cleaning in less time than it takes to rinse out a sponge. 
</P>
<P>
4 -- Sell your pets before attempting to sell your house. Dogs often drool; 
sometimes their drool can rival the flow of Niagara Falls, and when they shake 
their heads after drinking water, you might need a raincoat. A prospective 
buyer might think you have plumbing leaks with all the excess water on the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
Prospective home buyers don't enjoy birds either as they have a tendency to 
spit out seeds and shells indiscriminately, and without warning. Generally, 
home buyers do not like to be pelted by these flying missiles or dive-bombed by 
squawking parrots. 
</P>
<P>
Owning a cat should be illegal when your home is on the market. Kitty litter 
cannot smell good, no matter what brand it is, and kitty litter is less 
appealing when tossed out of the box by the cat and onto the carpeting. 
</P>
<P>
Go on a diet. While your house is on the market you should not cook anything 
that has a lingering odor. Brussels sprouts might be good for you, but they 
smell like used tennis socks when you cook them. That odor could drop the 
resale value of your home by hundreds of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Prospective buyers might not appreciate the aroma created by Uncle Bill's bass 
catch either; and you run the risk of offending the prospective vegetarian 
buyer if you are grilling T-bones in your back yard during their visit. 
</P>
<P>
6 -- Stock up on vacuums. You can't afford to have yours break down during this 
selling period, because lint, cracker crumbs, dog hairs and grass clippings on 
the carpet seem to multiply overnight as quickly as rabbits during the fishbowl 
period. 
</P>
<P>
7 -- Become close friends with a handyman, because anything that can break down 
will do so once that "For Sale" sign is up. 
</P>
<P>
Electric garage door openers will react to a sneeze. The garbage disposal will 
decide it's better to give than receive. The bathtub and shower will clog and 
resemble wading pools, and the self-cleaning oven will forget how to clean. 
</P>
<P>
8 -- Get rid of your telephone. If realtors have to write to schedule a 
showing, you'll have more time to tidy up before they arrive. 
</P>
<P>
"By appointment only" is somewhat misleading. It sounds very polite, but at 
whose convenience is the appointment made? You are terrified to turn down any 
appointment, no matter how bizarre or inconvenient the time. 
</P>
<P>
Some home buyers are out there so early Sunday morning that they are shopping 
before the morning paper arrives. Your realtor will often call with a hot 
prospect a) when you have just covered your face with an avocado facial, b) 
your husband's and your biological clocks finally mesh or c) when you have just 
filled the tub with the last drops of your favorite bath oil. 
</P>
<P>
9 -- Prepare an emergency battle plan to cope with the "Can we come by in 10 
minutes?" appointment. Decide in advance which family member runs the 100-yard 
dash with the vacuum, who is responsible for hiding the dirty dishes, who has 
to open the closets to check for fallen debris and who is on the wet towel and 
hairs in the bathroom sink patrol. 
</P>
<P>
10 -- Leave the house as often as possible when appointments are scheduled to 
show your home, or at least wear earplugs while the prospects are there. Some 
of the comments you will hear about your home and its interior decorating might 
enrage you to the point that you want to inflict bodily harm. 
</P>
<P>
The chandelier you cradled in your lap for 2,300 miles of cross-country driving 
is dismissed with "Oh well, it can be replaced." The bedroom wallpaper, which 
took eight weeks to find, reminds them of a Las Vegas casino bathroom. This 
couple wouldn't even consider sleeping in that bedroom until the wallpaper is 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
If you leave while your home is being shown, you will save yourself the 
frustration of watching these people as they poke and probe into every nook and 
cranny of your home and personal life style. It is less embarrassing to have a 
pelvic examination. 
</P>
<P>
Don't be shocked if the prospective home buyer surveys the contents of the 
vegetable bin in your refrigerator, even though it is not included in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Selling a home is not for the timid, but you should console yourself with this 
final thought: When the magical moment arrives and "Sold" is plastered across 
your "For Sale" sign, you have crossed the line and are now a buyer instead of 
a seller. 
</P>
<P>
You must call your realtor immediately, regardless of the time of day, and 
schedule appointments to watch others squirm in their fishbowls as you look for 
your next house.

POINT DEDUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding deduction of the cost of points on the refinance of a home residence 
on your income tax, both Robert Bruss, and now Benny L. Kass are giving out 
incorrect information. 
</P>
<P>
While it is true that points are not usually deductible in one year on a 
refinance, but must be amortized over the life of the loan, there are 
exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Before our refinance this year, I carefully investigated with the IRS, and 
found out that if the points are paid out of separate funds rather than the 
funds advanced by lender through the refinancing, and if a portion of the 
refinance money is used to improve your home, the points may be deducted in 
full in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
With the cost of home remodeling, it is certainly possible to deduct the full 
cost of points on a refinance in the year the loan is obtained, as we are 
doing. You are doing a disservice to your readers not to get this information 
out to them before they refinance, so that they may pay the points out of 
separate funds and thus qualify.

TALL AND SKINNY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing about something that I think is a concern of thousands of 
residents of our beautiful beach communities. Due to ever-increasing density, 
our once-charming towns are becoming miniature "Daly Cities." 
</P>
<P>
Quaint neighborhoods that once had a variety of styles of homes and large, 
beautiful trees are being replaced, block by block, by cookie-cutter 
architecture. The sad story has now been repeated hundreds of times: A charming 
older home on a large lot is torn down and is replaced with two "tall and 
skinnies." 
</P>
<P>
In North Redondo and Hermosa Beach, entire blocks have been covered with 
19-foot-wide tall and skinnies. The new homes almost completely cover the lots, 
and there is almost no room for outdoor entertaining or for children to play. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, the new homes are nice. They have trash compactors, spa bathtubs, 
built-in microwaves and an extra fireplace. However, all of those gizmos could 
be easily added to our existing homes. What cannot be corrected is the damage 
done by the tall and skinnization of our communities: 
</P>
<P>
We can never get back the lost views. We cannot get back the big, magnificent 
old trees and the spacious yards. And, we can never get back the lost sunlight 
that the soaring, densely-packed tall and skinnies have taken from us. 
</P>
<P>
Plus, the increased density is leading to traffic jams and noise pollution in 
once quiet neighborhoods.

BEETS ARE EASY TO GROW AND DON'T ATTRACT PESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SIDNAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beets are handsome and delicious additions to a vegetable garden. Their 
brilliant green foliage provides dramatic contrast to their dark-red roots, and 
freshly pulled beets have a sweetness and tenderness that market beets lack. 
</P>
<P>
Beets are a good choice for the home garden as they are quite easy to grow and 
are bothered by few insect pests. By growing your own, you can sample some 
choice beet varieties that are not available at the supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
Although beets are grown primarily for their roots, the tops, or greens as they 
are called, are very nutritious and an excellent substitute for spinach. Beets 
are a two-purpose vegetable and the wise gardener utilizes both the greens and 
the roots. 
</P>
<P>
My favorite beet is an old-fashioned variety called Lutz Green Leaf. It is also 
sold by some seed firms under the name Winter Keeper. The roots grow larger 
than other beets and are elongated and rough in appearance, but the flavor is 
always sweet and tender. The tops of Lutz Green Leaf are a distinctive pale 
green and are by far the most delicious beet greens I've ever eaten. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Lutz Beets, there is a wide selection of other good-quality 
beets available to the home gardener. Red as a beet doesn't always apply. 
Burpee's Golden beet is just what it says, gold in color and sweet. Also, it 
doesn't bleed when sliced. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is Cylindra, which grows to 8 inches in length, but is only 1 1/2 
inches in diameter. It is red and, if you like pickled beets, you'll find it 
convenient, for most of the slices are uniform in size. 
</P>
<P>
When planting beets, keep in mind that the root is what counts, and so the soil 
should be as loose and friable as you can make it. Spade the soil to a depth of 
at least 1 foot and work in lots of organic materials such as compost and peat 
moss. Make certain that any manure you add is well aged. Green manure will 
cause the beets to split. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Raised Beds or Containers 
</P>
<P>
If your soil is very poor, you might consider growing beets in raised beds or 
containers where you can mix your own soil. Beets are not heavy feeders. 
</P>
<P>
Beets do well in rows, or scatter plant them in individual plots. Don't try to 
transplant them, as this will cause misshapen roots. When planting the seeds, 
follow the directions on the seed packet carefully as to seed depth and 
spacing. 
</P>
<P>
Each beet seed actually consists of a cluster of two or three seeds that 
germinate in clumps and need to be thinned to one plant per seed. When the 
young plants are 2 inches high, it is very important to thin them as outlined 
on the seed packet instructions. 
</P>
<P>
Beets, other than Lutz beets, should be harvested when they are 2 to 3 inches 
in diameter. If left in the soil too long, they become tough and woody. 
</P>
<P>
Beets require regular watering and should be irrigated on a weekly basis, or 
more often if they are grown in containers. 
</P>
<P>
Except for Lutz beets, seeds for most beet varieties mentioned here are 
available in seed racks at local nurseries and garden centers. Seeds for Lutz 
beets are available by mail from Burpee Seeds, 300 Park Ave., Warminster, Pa. 
18991.

SAVING SEEDS CAN HELP PREVENT PLANT EXTINCTION

<TEXT>
<P>
To keep every cog and wheel is the first precaution of intelligent tinkering. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Aldo Leopold 
</P>
<P>
Ever since plants first sprouted from the primordial ooze, they have reproduced 
themselves without interference from humans -- until, earlier in this century, 
we started fiddling around. 
</P>
<P>
We found that we could cross-pollinate, say, two different varieties of 
cucumber -- two varieties that would never have mated on their own. 
</P>
<P>
The hybrid children of this forced union would be unable to reproduce 
themselves. Seed from the hybrid offspring would not grow up to be like the 
parent plant, but would revert to one or the other grandparent -- or to 
something else entirely. Its genetic code had been scrambled. 
</P>
<P>
This tinkering proved irresistible, because we learned that these hybrids could 
be made bigger and more predictable, with uniform size, color and ripening, 
occasional disease resistance and even tough hides to endure transcontinental 
shipping. This proved a boon to commercial farmers and home gardeners alike. 
Suddenly we had dependable yields, although sometimes at the expense of taste. 
</P>
<P>
The popularity of hybrids has made it difficult for today's home gardener to 
find seeds that are open-pollinated -- those that will re-create themselves 
year after year from seed produced by the plant that is gathered, saved and 
sowed by the gardener. And some people feel that this is cause for alarm. 
</P>
<P>
First, hybrid seeds are expensive, because they are often hand-pollinated. A 
$1.25 packet of hybrid tomato seeds may net the gardener only 20 seeds, while a 
$1.25 packet of non-hybrid seeds could yield hundreds of seeds. And since a 
gardener cannot save seeds from hybrids, he must buy them again and again. 
</P>
<P>
But the most serious objection to hybrids is that they are responsible for 
reducing genetic diversity. Since a hybridizer will only use a few 
open-pollinated varieties to perpetuate his hybrids, and since seed companies 
like selling hybrids because they are so profitable -- recent legislation 
permits them to copyright their hybrid inventions -- hundreds of varieties of 
open-pollinated vegetables and fruits have disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
According to Bill Bruneau, manager of Ecology Action's Bountiful Gardens, a 
mail-order seed and gardening operation, "The more you get into hybrids, the 
more you're losing that resource base you make hybrids from." 
</P>
<P>
If a hybridizer uses open-pollinated Rutgers &amp; Pearson tomatoes to make his 
hybrid, then he has no reason to grow Ace or Homestead or Beefsteak. 
</P>
<P>
But, say the alarmists, what if Ace and Homestead and the others have 
significant characteristics that will prove valuable to future food supplies? 
What if, for instance, Ace is the perfect tomato for drought-stricken Ethiopia? 
If we allow Ace to become extinct, those opportunities are also dead. 
</P>
<P>
About 15 years ago, a few people began to combat this hybrid trend, and now 
several organizations across the country are devoted to finding and saving 
open-pollinated varieties. 
</P>
<P>
The first, and certainly the most influential, is Seed Savers Exchange, founded 
in 1975 by Kent Whealy in Decorah, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Seed Savers Exchange members buy seeds from each other with the understanding 
that the purchaser is then also responsible for preserving that variety. Seed 
Savers Exchange is not a seed company. 
</P>
<P>
This year, he said, "we had about 800 people that were listing varieties in our 
1989 yearbook. It's made quite an impact." 
</P>
<P>
But, Whealy added, "just because there's a listing doesn't mean that a variety 
will stay around." Whealy notes that 1,271 varieties -- most perpetuated by 
back-yard gardeners saving their seeds, sometimes for generations -- were 
re-introduced into seed catalogues between 1984 and 1987, offsetting the 943 
varieties lost in that period. But he is not complacent: 
</P>
<P>
"I worry about commercial varieties that are being dropped." Many varieties are 
carried by only one seed company and if the company discontinues a variety, it 
could be lost. 
</P>
<P>
Whealy's nonprofit organization publishes "Garden Seed Inventory," which lists, 
often with descriptions, open-pollinated seeds that are available through 
commercial U.S. and Canadian seed companies. It also issues an annual yearbook, 
a hefty list of all the open-pollinated vegetables, fruits and herbs grown by 
and available to its members. 
</P>
<P>
There are several West Coast seed companies that sell open-pollinated seeds and 
many of them specialize in old-fashioned varieties. Most of these companies are 
owned by gardening missionaries. Their catalogues exhort customers to save 
their own seed, to be self-reliant. 
</P>
<P>
Still, says Bruneau, "very few gardeners grow their own seed; it's just too 
easy to buy more." But by buying more seed every year, the gardener misses out 
on an important step: 
</P>
<P>
"Think how exciting it is if you are the one conservator of that plant," 
Bruneau said. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Dremann of Redwood City Seed Co. sees an interesting parallel with Ray 
Bradbury's futuristic "Fahrenheit 451," in which each individual memorized a 
book in order to preserve it after the book itself was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
"With seeds and their preservation," Dremann says, "each individual makes a 
significant contribution." It doesn't have to be a historically important 
contribution. You may not be the solitary caretaker of the last Anasazi beans 
(a Pueblo Indian variety that was feared lost until it was recently 
rediscovered in New Mexico); you may only save Blue Lake bean seeds, a variety 
far from extinct. 
</P>
<P>
Once the process becomes familiar, most gardeners may be tempted to raise at 
least one rarity, because no matter what the variety, gathering seeds casts a 
spell all its own. 
</P>
<P>
You hold the past and the future in the palm of your hand. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

FAN CAN RID BATHROOM OF TOO MUCH HUMIDITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MORRIS and JAMES CAREY, The Careys are syndicated columnists and general 
contractors in the San Francisco Bay area. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: A licensed contractor is fixing my bathroom, which had a leak between 
the tile and the bathtub. I asked him if I needed a bathroom fan to get rid of 
the humidity that goes into the bedroom after showers. He stated I didn't need 
one because I have a window in the bathroom. I would like your opinion about 
this. Also, if you recommend installing a fan even with the existence of a 
window, what brand do you recommend? Is there a noiseless one? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Your contractor is correct. Section 1205 of the Uniform Building Code 
(1979) states that where bathrooms have natural ventilation by means of 
openable exterior openings (such as windows or skylights) with a minimum of 1 
1/2 square feet, a mechanical ventilation system or bath fan is not required. 
</P>
<P>
So much for building code minimums. Now we must address specifically what your 
needs dictate. Granted, if you have an operable window, you aren't required to 
have a bath fan but you may in fact need one. There is a definite difference 
here. 
</P>
<P>
Your description of an abundance of steam accumulating in the bedroom is a sure 
sign that a fan is needed. We strongly recommend that you consider installing 
one. 
</P>
<P>
There is no such thing as a noiseless exhaust fan. Some, however, are less 
noisy than others. Fans are rated by the cubic feet per minute (CFM) of air 
that they move and are also rated by the level of noise they emit. Remember, 
the building code does require that a bath fan provide a minimum of five air 
changes an hour. Some simple math will tell you just what size fan you will 
need.Draining Water Heater Enhances Efficiency 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is there something I can do to improve the efficiency of my water heater? It 
seems like the higher my utility bill goes, the longer it takes for me to get 
hot water. 
</P>
<P>
A: There are several things that you may do to improve the performance and 
longevity of a water heater. The fact that your utility bill is high and that 
you are having trouble maintaining hot water are no doubt related. 
</P>
<P>
First, it's a good idea to drain the water heater at least once annually, and 
twice annually in areas where the water is abundant with mineral deposits. This 
will prevent the accumulation of sediment at the bottom of the tank, which 
greatly inhibits the effectiveness of the gas burners below. 
</P>
<P>
An electric water heater will also benefit from this because once drained, you 
can remove the heating elements and clean any debris that has accumulated on 
them. It is not unusual for these elements to eventually corrode and become 
nonfunctional. 
</P>
<P>
Draining the water heater is a relatively simple task that generaly doesn't 
even require any tools. Start by turning off the gas or electricity to the 
appliance, and close the cold water valve at the top of the tank. 
</P>
<P>
Connect a garden hose to the drain valve located at the bottom of the tank and 
open the valve a couple of turns. You will also want to open at least one 
hot-water faucet somewhere in the house. This will let air into the tank and 
help it to drain. Once the tank is empty, turn the cold water valve at the top 
of the tank back on, and close the drain valve (after water from the drain 
appears clear). 
</P>
<P>
The faucet that was opened when draining should remain open, allowing air to 
escape until water comes rushing out of it. Disconnect the hose and restore 
power to the unit.Sources for Locating Qualified Contractors 
</P>
<P>
Q: I contacted 12 painting contractors (referrals, advertisements, Yellow 
Pages) and scheduled appointments. Seven came and looked at the exterior of the 
building. All seven said they would be "calling in a few days and would put 
together a bid for the job." 
</P>
<P>
Only three responded with a written estimate. I don't feel totally comfortable 
with the three estimates I did receive. However, I don't want to pick 10 more 
contractors out of the Yellow Pages, wasting my time with contractors who don't 
show up, do show up but don't submit an estimate and those that don't call 
back. 
</P>
<P>
Frankly, I'm disappointed. What am I doing wrong? My list of contractors with 
no response is longer than the list of those who did. 
</P>
<P>
A: You aren't doing anything wrong. As a matter of fact we want to congratulate 
you for all of the valuable time that you are investing in the selection of a 
contractor. It is apparent that you recognize the value of contracting with a 
professional to improve your home. 
</P>
<P>
Your "buyer beware" attitude may tend to be exhausting now, but you will reap 
the fruits of your labor when the painting starts. 
</P>
<P>
The methods that you have used to locate contractors are good ones (such as 
referrals, advertisements and the Yellow Pages). However, your list is not 
complete. Many counties have a Builders Exchange that maintains a membership 
roster by trade. They may even make a few recommendations if you ask. 
</P>
<P>
Another good way to find a good contractor is through a national trade 
organization with a branch in the area. Generally, these organizations maintain 
stringent criteria for membership and require their members to adhere to a code 
of ethics and high business standards. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to these precautions, you should also contact the Contractors State 
License Board and the Better Business Bureau to ensure that the contractors you 
are considering are in good standing with these respective agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, once you have found someone you are comfortable with, make sure that 
he has all of the proper insurance required to perform the work, and that his 
contract is fair and includes everything that you have discussed. Remember, if 
it's not in writing, chances are that you won't get it.

<P>
QUESTION: It gets chilly and drafty near our aluminum sliding glass patio door 
and I feel a warm air leak in the summer. What type of replacement doors are 
best to block both the cold and heat and lower our heating bills? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: A typical metal sliding-glass patio door is one of the most 
energy-wasting items in a house. To exacerbate the problem in the winter, you 
feel chilly from the drafts, so you set the room temperature higher to 
compensate. 
</P>
<P>
The three most important factors to consider are the basic design (sliding or 
swinging), the frame material and the type of glass. The basic design and frame 
material have the greatest impact on the airtightness of the door. The type of 
glass impacts the conductive heat loss the most. 
</P>
<P>
Double swinging (French) doors can be designed to seal very well. With swinging 
doors, much of the weatherstripping can be the compression type. If you chose 
insulated metal doors, super-airtight magnetic seals, like on your refrigerator 
door, are used. Compare the air leakage (infiltration) specifications for each 
door you consider. 
</P>
<P>
However, before you consider swinging doors, make sure you have adequate open 
area in your room for the doors to open. Sliding doors are real floor space 
savers because you can place furniture near them. 
</P>
<P>
With any type of sliding-glass door, a very strong frame material and good 
design are important. These doors take a lot of impact abuse. They must remain 
true, otherwise even the best weatherstripping won't be effective. 
</P>
<P>
There is a new type of sliding-glass door with a unique track design. The door 
closes in a similar fashion to an airplane door. They are flush when closed. 
This provides one of the most airtight seals. It is also very secure against 
break-ins. 
</P>
<P>
The frame is made of special fiberglass. Fiberglass is very strong and it 
expands or contracts very little with temperature and humidity changes 
throughout the year. Unlike vinyl and aluminum, you can easily paint the 
fiberglass frame to change colors if you desire. 
</P>
<P>
The glass options for patio doors are the same as for windows. The two most 
energy-efficient glass systems are Heat Mirror and low-emissivity (Low-E) 
filled with argon gas. Both have an insulating R-value more than three times 
greater than single-pane glass and they block outdoor noise. 
</P>
<P>
You can write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 370, showing a list of patio 
door manufacturers (sliding and swinging), frame materials and types of glass 
they offer, and information on the new fiberglass airplane-type door. Please 
include $1 and a self-addressed business-sized envelope. Send your requests to

Furnace Cycles but Doesn't Produce Heat 
</P>
<P>
Q: My furnace cycles on and off every couple of minutes, but it doesn't produce 
heat. What could cause this and what can I do to fix it? 
</P>
<P>
A: The most probable cause is that your furnace is cycling on the fan/limit 
switch. It shuts off the burners when the temperature inside the furnace gets 
too high. This is often the result of inadequate air flow through your heating 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Check to make sure the furnace filter is clean and not blocking the air flow. 
Check the tension adjustment on the blower belt so it isn't slipping. Make sure 
the duct dampers are in the open position and that the return registers aren't 
blocked by carpets. If everything checks out properly, you should contact your 
service technician.

APARTMENT LIFE: LANDLORD PUTS OFF RESTORING HER PORCH LIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN POSTEMA, Postema is the editor of Apartment Age Magazine, a 
publication of the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los Angeles, an apartment owners' 
service group. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I am 71 and live alone. My landlord stuccoed the San Pedro duplex 
where I have lived since last summer. He has had one excuse after another for 
not restoring the porch light. It's very dark at night, and I am afraid to 
answer the door when I can't see who it is. What can I do to get the landlord 
to get the porch light working? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Proper lighting is more than just a convenience. As you indicate in 
your letter, it's a safety issue as well. If your repeated efforts to get the 
landlord to fix the porch light have been unsuccessful, you can report him to 
the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety at (213) 485-7091. 
</P>
<P>
You might want to let the owner know that you are going to report him and get 
him cited if he refuses to cooperate. You should also inform him that if a 
crime or accident occurs because of the lack of lighting, which he knows about, 
he could be the target of a major lawsuit. He should get the light fixed for 
his own peace of mind, if for no other reason. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Evicted Tenant Left Her Personal Property 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am writing on behalf of my wife and mother-in-law, who co-own a rental 
home in Los Angeles. After five months of non-payment of rent by the elderly 
tenant who lived there, they were finally able to evict her. 
</P>
<P>
While we all felt sorry for her, paying all of the mortgage out of their own 
pockets on this rental home was becoming financially difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Here's the problem. The former tenant has not made any attempt to remove her 
personal belongings from the home since her eviction. Unfortunately, the former 
tenant may also be senile, and she has no relatives in California. She's 
staying in the psychiatric ward of the county hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The owners have phoned and written her many times, asking her to remove her 
belongings but nothing has happened. 
</P>
<P>
Now, they must do something. Storing the belongings would be too expensive. Can 
they legally sell her belongings and deduct her back rent from the proceeds and 
give her the difference? If not, what legal action can they take? 
</P>
<P>
A: Los Angeles County's "Public Guardian" is charged with caring for the 
property of those with severe mental problems. You may contact him at (213) 
974-0511. Otherwise, the state provides property owners with methods for 
disposing of abandoned personal property. 
</P>
<P>
After an eviction such as you describe, state law requires you to notify, in 
writing, the person or persons whose property you intend to dispose of. You 
needn't establish whether or not the property is abandoned, as is sometimes the 
case. It is clearly abandoned after an eviction. 
</P>
<P>
Your written notice must give the respondent at least 15 days to claim the 
property if served personally, or 18 days if mailed. It may also require her to 
pay the reasonable cost of storage of the property. 
</P>
<P>
If the total value of the property is under $300, you may dispose of it in any 
way you see fit if the former tenant doesn't claim it in the prescribed time. 
</P>
<P>
If your former tenant doesn't claim the property in the prescribed time, and 
it's worth more than $300, here's what happens, according to California Civil 
Code Section 1988: 
</P>
<P>
"If you fail to reclaim the property, it will be sold at a public sale after 
notice of the sale has been given by publication. You have the right to bid on 
the property at this sale. After the property is sold and the cost of storage, 
advertising and sale is deducted, the remaining money will be paid over to the 
county. You may claim the remaining money at anytime within one year after the 
county received the money." 
</P>
<P>
You must carefully inventory the property, regardless of worth, for your public 
sale. You must also publish, in any newspaper of general circulation, a notice 
of the upcoming sale. 
</P>
<P>
After the sale, as noted above, you can keep only the costs associated with the 
storage and sale of the property. There is no provision in the code authorizing 
you to keep any part of the proceeds of the sale for unpaid rent. That issue 
should have been addressed during the eviction action.

Landlords' Telephone Obligation Defined 
</P>
<P>
Q: I live in Los Angeles, and I was shocked to read your Feb. 18 response to 
the question "Tenant Wants Owner to Repair Phone Jacks." You stated: "The 
reason the phone companies offer the insurance to renters is because renters 
are responsible for fixing it." In fact, phone companies offer the insurance to 
persons ordering phone service, whether they be homeowners, lessees or 
sub-lessees. 
</P>
<P>
Please advise me and your readers as to the legal authority and facts upon 
which you based your answer. 
</P>
<P>
A: Prepare to be further shocked. According to Jim Fleck, director of research 
for Los Angeles' Rent Stabilization Division, the landlord is not responsible 
for telephone wiring or jack repairs, except in very limited circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, if the landlord provides telephone service (few do), the 
responsibility for its repair may be his. Similarly, if the rental agreement 
makes some kind of provision for the landlord to make such repairs or maintain 
the phone system, then the repair of the jacks or wiring may also be the 
landlord's. 
</P>
<P>
Absent a situation like those, maintaining the phone wiring and jacks is the 
responsibility of the tenant. 
</P>
<P>
"If the tenant doesn't pay the phone bill, it gets disconnected," Fleck noted. 
"The landlord doesn't have to pay to reconnect the phone. He also doesn't have 
to pay to fix it when it breaks." 
</P>
<P>
According to Marina del Rey real estate attorney Duane Hall, "Telephones are 
amenities like television sets. Asking a landlord to fix the phone system is 
like asking him to fix your television set." 
</P>
<P>
Your letter states: "Phone companies offer the insurance to persons ordering 
phone service, whether they be homeowners, lessees or sub-lessees." Absent from 
that list is "lessors."

INTERIORS: AMERICAN COUNTRY PERMITS ERA MIX AND MATCH; 
</P>
<P>
REDECORATING: ROOMS WITH RURAL DESIGNS CAN COMBINE OBJECTS FROM VARIOUS PERIODS 
AND PLACES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MAYER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For people who don't want to be pinned down to a single style, American country 
is one of the best decorating choices. 
</P>
<P>
Since it is an adaptation of rural designs to suit contemporary needs and not 
from a single period or place, American country is well adapted to today's 
needs, says designer Raymond Waites. 
</P>
<P>
Waites has written several books on American country style and has also 
designed reproduction collections of furniture, fabrics, wall coverings and 
accessories. He says that "the overriding point of American country is its 
spirit. You can mix periods and styles as long as the room maintains its casual 
quality." 
</P>
<P>
For example, he says it's easily possible to put together a room that includes 
Shaker reproductions, primitive painted pieces and Victorian wicker. When 
decorating American country-style, look for rustic furniture in native American 
woods such as walnut, chestnut, maple and pine or painted pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Hura is a designer who has created many American country room settings 
in which to display the Museum of American Folk Art reproduction collection by 
Lane. He offers these tips to a successful American country room: 
</P>
<P>
Keep backgrounds simple and uncluttered. Choose clear colors and select 
accessories that are not too fussy. You can soften the feeling of the 
contemporary American country room with lace and floral fabrics. Or you can 
make the room more masculine with cowhide and American Indian motifs, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Hura says that there are several ways to go with traditional American country 
rooms. First, decide whether you want to create a formal or a rustic setting. 
</P>
<P>
If it's formal -- a style that suggests small-town America of the mid-19th 
Century -- choose Victorian-style furniture such as adaptations of English and 
French pieces. Use area rugs, such as an Oriental or a needlepoint rug, on the 
floors. You can choose simple window treatments or more elaborate layered 
effects that combine a heavier fabric with a sheer undercurtain. Wallpaper the 
walls, making use of borders to take the place of architectural detailing that 
may be lacking. 
</P>
<P>
A more primitive and rustic room is the result when you select twig furniture, 
rustic pine pieces or the newly popular arts and crafts style. Place rag rugs 
or hooked rugs on the floors. Walls can be simply whitewashed or stenciled. 
Rough textured fabrics of homespun cotton and linen are appropriate, and simple 
country pottery and tin spatter ware are suitable. Baskets of dried flowers, 
flowering potted plants and original or reproductions of primitive paintings 
are also in character. 
</P>
<P>
Another variant of the American country look incorporates motifs from the 
American West, such as California mission furniture, ornate, yet rough-hewn 
Spanish or Mexican pieces, or German-American Biedermaier pieces. The color 
scheme comes from Indians blankets and the earth tones of the American West. 
</P>
<P>
An advantage in furnishing American country style is that reproductions from 
virtually all the earlier periods are now available. Besides colonial and 
federal-style furniture, you'll find reproductions of country pieces from the 
19th Century as well as copies of Mission and Arts and Crafts style furniture.

BRIGHT ALTERNATIVES FOR LIGHTING DINING ROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Building Ideas 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The combination of dining room and chandelier is as natural as bread and 
butter. 
</P>
<P>
However, the editors at Better Homes and Gardens' Building Ideas say the light 
from a single chandelier isn't always adequate, and in newer, more contemporary 
houses there may be better choices. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, in open spaces, a chandelier's limited range will result in 
shadowy surrounding areas. For another, more aesthetically pleasing treatments 
are available. 
</P>
<P>
In dining rooms with exceptionally high vaulted ceilings, for example, a 
solitary fixture on a long drop of conduit might not be the best source of 
lighting. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, consider using track or recessed lighting, neither of which would 
interrupt the architecturally interesting lines of the room. Both types of 
lighting can also enhance any pattern in the surface material of the room, and 
the individual lights can be focused on different areas, as down-lighting for 
artworks, for example. 
</P>
<P>
Even in rooms where a chandelier is the light source of choice, additional 
lighting is often necessary. To help illuminate the table area, a ring of four 
recessed down-lights around the outer edge of the table is effective. 
</P>
<P>
Add needed light at the walls, flanking a buffet or server with wall sconces 
mounted 60 inches above the floor. Tungsten-halogen is popular as a light 
source for these small, light-intense fixtures. Track or recessed lighting is 
also useful over a buffet, with fixtures spaced 2 to 3 feet apart and mounted 9 
to 12 inches from the wall. 
</P>
<P>
For a china closet that didn't come with under-shelf strip lighting, consider 
adding some to show off china and collectibles -- as well as to help balance 
the light throughout the room. 
</P>
<P>
To make the most of lighting arrangements, use dimmer switches. These will help 
change the mood and illumination of a dining room to suit the activity taking 
place.

JERRY HULSE'S TRAVEL TIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HULSE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Today's Tips column is devoted to both the seasoned and first-time traveler, 
with an update on passports and visas plus other items related to this week's 
theme: International Travel. Because the column contains basics for the 
overseas visitor, we suggest it be filed as a reference for future journeys. 
</P>
<P>
Passports: With record numbers of Americans preparing to go abroad in 1990, 
director Sakae Hawley of the U.S. Passport Agency in West Los Angeles is urging 
travelers to apply now to avoid the summer rush. Busiest hours: 11 a.m. to 2 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Applicants must possess evidence of U.S. citizenship, plus a driver's license 
or other identification. Two photos (two inches square) are required. Adult 
passports good for 10 years cost $42 (or $35 in the case of renewals). Persons 
under 18 pay $27 for a five-year passport. Take cash, check or money order in 
the exact amount of the passport to the U.S. Passport Agency, 11000 Wilshire 
Blvd., 13th Floor, West Los Angeles, or save yourself the aggravation of long 
lines by obtaining application forms at post offices or county courthouses that 
may be processed later by the agency. 
</P>
<P>
For recorded instructions, telephone (213) 209-7070. 
</P>
<P>
Visas: Several agencies will help you obtain visas. The oldest and most 
experienced is Visas International, which operates a daily courier service to 
Washington, D.C. Takes from one day to three weeks (depending on the country) 
to get your visa. Figure on three weeks for the Soviet Union, Poland, Romania. 
Ten days for Czechoslovakia/Hungary. Visas aren't required by Western European 
countries (including France, which discontinued the practice last year). In the 
South Pacific, only Australia requires a visa. Rules vary in the Orient, South 
America. 
</P>
<P>
For a free brochure containing the requirements for other countries, write to 
Visas International, 3169 Barbara Court, Los Angeles 90068, or call (213) 
850-1192. 
</P>
<P>
Other Visa Services: International Passports &amp; Visas, 205 S. Beverly Drive, 
Suite 204, Los Angeles 90212. Telephone (213) 274-2020. 
</P>
<P>
 -- World Wide Visa Service, 1712 N. Pacific Ave., Glendale 91202. Call (213) 
245-0934 for an appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Intercontinental Visa Service, Suite 185, World Trade Center, 350 S. 
Figueroa St., Los Angeles 90071. Telephone (213) 625-7175. (Intercontinental 
also takes passport photos, stocks travel accessories.) 
</P>
<P>
Persons living outside the Los Angeles area should contact their travel agents 
or consulates for additional information. 
</P>
<P>
The World by Train: A guide on rail travel written by Kathryn Turpin and Marvin 
Saltzman in 1971 has grown to 816 pages. Covers 112 countries. "Every rail trip 
in the world that a tourist might wish to take," insists Saltzman. The title: 
"Eurailguide -- How to Travel Europe and All the World by Train." Sells for 
$12.95 at leading bookstores or $15.42 direct from Eurailguide, 27540 Pacific 
Coast Highway, Malibu 90265. For a free brochure, send a stamped, 
self-addressed envelope to the Malibu address or call (213) 457-7286. The 
world's most exotic rail trip? Saltzman's vote is for a journey between Lima 
and Huancayo in Peru. At one point the train reaches a breathtaking altitude of 
15,681 feet. So rarified is the air that a doctor aboard the train administers 
oxygen to passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Driving Overseas: If you intend to rent a car overseas, remember that some 
countries require an international driver's license. (Ask your travel agent for 
a list.) Apply at offices of the Automobile Club of Southern California. You'll 
need a couple of passport-size photos plus your California driver's license. 
International licenses are issued on the spot. The Auto Club is an excellent 
source for maps/guide material. Advisers on the travel desk answer questions, 
offer advice. 
</P>
<P>
The Basics: We're reprinting a list of special tips the international traveler 
should keep handy: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Photocopy your travel documents (passport identification page, airline 
tickets, driver's license, credit cards) for use if reissuance is necessary due 
to loss/theft while abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 -- List serial numbers of your traveler's checks, and cash checks only as 
additional foreign currency is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Do not exchange currency at black market rates. Could mean real trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Contact U.S. Embassy staffs in the event of legal, medical or financial 
emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Carry your medical insurance identity card as well as a claim form. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Before leaving home, inquire about evacuation insurance in the event an 
emergency should arise. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Make a list of travel documents (clothing, medication, etc.). After this, 
check off each item while packing. 
</P>
<P>
Greek Holiday: Here's an item for every frustrated soul who has ever dreamed of 
escaping the real world. In a move to attract new visitors, the Greeks are 
preparing guest accommodations in remote villages throughout their land. A 
choice of homes perched on the slopes of Makrinitsa in central Greece. Others 
on the storied island of Santorini (a favorite haunt of mine). In the 
northeastern Aegean Islands, vacationers settle in a 14th-Century whitewashed 
village. Vaulted streets. Peaceful courtyards. Dozens of other choices 
throughout Greece, including a medieval tower in the south Peloponnesus. 
</P>
<P>
Details from the Greek National Tourist Organization, 611 West 6th St., Suite 
2198, Los Angeles 90017, (213) 626-6696. Ask for a copy of "Traditional 
Settlements -- Guest Houses." 
</P>
<P>
Cottage Directory: Livingston Holidays of Santa Ana has published a new 
brochure featuring private rentals in Britain. A cottage and a car for a week 
for as little as $500. Or live like royalty in a Scottish castle (contains a 
dozen bedrooms) for a hefty $3,089. The Livingston people rent flats in London, 
put together specialized tours and arrange for low-cost flights across the pond 
from Los Angeles.

non-essential travel to Srinigar, the Kashmir Valley and surrounding areas. 
Exercise caution. 
</P>
<P>
The only official border crossing to Pakistan for foreigners is at Attara, 
Punjab/Wahah, Pakistan. A Pakistani visa is required, and travelers may cross 
by train or road any day of the week between 9:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Maldives: Far from the cares of the world, isolated in the Indian 
Ocean, The Maldives is a chain of atolls extending 500 miles north to south 
about 400 miles south of India. The largest of the republic's 1,200 islands is 
only five square miles, and few rise more than six feet above sea level. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years scientists from around the world have gone there to study the 
effects of rising sea levels caused by the so-called "greenhouse effect." A 
rise of three feet is considered quite possible in the next century, and such a 
rise would submerge many of these islands and wreak havoc on the rest. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1988, a band of Tamil mercenaries from Sri Lanka staged a coup in 
the capital city of Male, hoping to turn the islands into a staging area for 
their insurgent war against the Sri Lankan government. 
</P>
<P>
Their plan quickly went awry, but as a measure against future coup attempts, 
foreigners are required to be off the streets of Male by 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Maldives are best known for their pristine beaches, clear tropical waters 
and spectacular reef life. The legal system is derived from traditional Islamic 
law, and the importation of alcohol, pork products and pornography is 
prohibited. Prohibition of alcohol does not extend to the resorts, however, and 
each one has a bar. 
</P>
<P>
Sailors must report to government officials in Male before landing on any of 
the outer islands, and such restrictions are usually enforced by island chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
All islands except Male are subject to malaria, and appropriate precautions 
should be taken. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nepal: Recent violent demonstrations by protesters demanding multi-party 
democracy indicate a growing dissatisfaction with the ruling monarchy in this 
kingdom where political parties have been banned for 29 years. 
</P>
<P>
Although the violence took place in Bhaktapur, eight miles from the capital 
city of Katmandu and a popular side-trip for visitors to the Katmandu Valley, 
travel here is unlikely to be affected because the democracy movement hasn't 
developed a broad base of support. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pakistan: Political violence in Karachi flared recently during a strike 
called by an opposition party representing Mohajir migrants from India, 
resulting in an indefinite curfew in many parts of the city. The situation can 
change rapidly; follow local press reports for current information. 
</P>
<P>
Africa 
</P>
<P>
 -- Chad: Travel is restricted in the northern regions along the Libyan border 
and the eastern regions bordering Sudan. The north remains a militarized zone, 
although Chad and Libya have agreed to negotiate their differences, and the 
east has been the site of recent clashes between government forces and armed 
guerrillas. Check with the U.S. Embassy in N'Djamena for current information. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Zambia: A cholera epidemic in the capital city of Lusaka poses a 
significant health risk. Social gatherings have been banned and schools have 
been closed. If traveling here, be sure to avoid drinking tap water and eat 
only fully cooked food. 
</P>
<P>
Mediterranean 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cyprus: Hotel rooms will be hard to find in Nicosia from March 28 to April 
8 due to a meeting of the International Postal Union. Be sure to comfirm 
accommodations before arrival. 
</P>
<P>
Although progress has been made in talks between the Greek-Cypriot government 
of the Republic of Cyprus and the Turkish-Cypriot government of the Turkish 
Republic of Northern Cyprus about resolving the division of the island, the 
only legal points of entry remain Larnaca and Paphos international airports and 
the seaports of Limassol, Larnaca and Paphos. 
</P>
<P>
These ports are all in the southern part of the island, controlled by the 
internationally recognized government of the Republic of Cyprus. Travelers who 
arrive at Turkish-Cypriot ports will not be allowed to cross into the 
Greek-Cypriot controlled areas, even for transit purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Travel from the south to the Turkish-Cypriot controlled areas in the north is 
often possible, but shouldn't be assumed to be unrestricted. 
</P>
<P>
Europe/Soviet Union 
</P>
<P>
 -- Italy: Hotel accommodations will be difficult to obtain in many Italian 
cities this summer due to the World Cup soccer championship being held in 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Accommodations will be tight in Rome from late May through early July, and 
throughout the month of June in Bari, Bologna, Cagliari, Florence, Genoa, 
Milan, Naples, Palermo, Turin, Udine and Verona. Be sure to comfirm 
accommodations before arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sweden: Beginning July 1, one of the world's strictest drinking and driving 
laws will get stricter, when the permissible alcohol level for drivers will 
drop to 0.2% from 0.5%. A single glass of wine or beer will put drivers over 
the limit; avoid alcohol completely if you are planning to drive in Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Soviet Union: Travel to many regions of the Soviet Union remains risky due 
to ethnic and political unrest. Check with the State Department or local 
authorities for current information if you are planning trips to Armenia, 
Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Moldavia, Tadzhikistan or Uzbekistan. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Yugoslavia: Ethnic unrest continues in troubled Kosovo province, where the 
Yugoslav army recently was sent for the first time to quell disturbances. Defer 
unnecessary travel. 
</P>
<P>
South America 
</P>
<P>
 -- Colombia: Americans and American interests have been targeted by a 
guerrilla group, and the threat has been backed by the recent kidnapings of 
three Americans. The government is increasing security for American facilities 
and officials. Exercise caution. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Peru: An American was killed recently amid the Inca ruins of Sacsayhuaman, 
which overlook the city of Cuzco. This is a grim reminder to exercise caution 
in the city and surrounding areas, and to avoid visiting archeological sites 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
Oceania 
</P>
<P>
 -- Papua New Guinea: Avoid travel to Bougainville Island, where a state of 
emergency exists due to armed insurgency. Violent crime continues to be a 
problem in rural and urban areas, and traveling alone is not advised. Be 
especially cautious in Lae and Port Moresby at night. Avoid Mt. Hagen and the 
Daiver River area in the Western Highlands. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Western Samoa: A cyclone struck in early February, causing severe damage to 
housing, transportation and food crops. A national emergency is in effect, and 
inter-island transportation and communication has been disrupted. Defer 
non-essential travel. 
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asia 
</P>
<P>
 -- Philippines: Despite reports of possible coup attempts, most urban centers 
and tourist destinations are considered safe for travelers. These include 
Manila, Baguio, the Batangas area, Puerto Galera, Dipolog, Bohol, Boracay, 
Camiguin, Marinduque, Palawan and most areas of Cebu. 
</P>
<P>
Travel should be avoided to Samar, Marawi City in Lanao del Sur, Sulu, Basilan, 
Kalinga Apayao and the Cagayan Valley in Cagayan and Isabela provinces. 
</P>
<P>
Exercise caution when traveling to parts of Luzon, especially Ifugao and 
Mountain provinces, including Banaue and Sagada. Use common sense precautions 
against street crime, especially in entertainment districts. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Singapore: In its drive for modernization Singapore destroyed much of its 
heritage as historic parts of the city were razed in the name of development. 
</P>
<P>
Aware of the value of tourism (its third-largest industry), the republic is in 
the middle of a five-year restoration effort to rebuild many of those areas. 
</P>
<P>
The first major project, restoration of the 125-year-old Empress Place, a 
neo-classical building by the Singapore River where Raffles supposedly landed, 
was completed last April. The place will be used as a museum housing revolving 
exhibits, the first of which showcases artifacts from China's last dynasty and 
runs through April. 
</P>
<P>
The master plan to restore old Singapore lists for rebuilding temples, mosques 
and traditional shophouses in districts such as Chinatown and Little India, as 
well as several colonial structures. 
</P>
<P>
Tiger Balm Garden, a bizarre collection of exhibits depicting Chinese 
mythology, was closed for restoration in July, 1988, and is scheduled to reopen 
in April as a high-tech amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
The historic Raffles Hotel is also closed for restoration, and is due to be 
reopened at the end of 1991. Bugis Street, the notorious red-light district 
that was razed to make way for Singapore's subway, will be re-created, as much 
as such a place can be, near its original site by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
A strict code of behavior is imposed in Singapore. Laws prohibiting spitting, 
littering, smoking in certain areas, even failing to flush public toilets are 
enforced, some with expensive fines. There is little crime, with most visitor 
complaints concerning taxis or misrepresentation of goods. 
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Tourist Promotion Board works with the Consumer Assn. of 
Singapore to address such complaints, and tries to resolve them within 24 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Vietnam: Independent travel is possible if the traveler first enters on a 
tour and then requests a visa extension. Extensions are valid for 14 days. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern Europe 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bulgaria: Travel conditions in Bulgaria should improve in the months ahead, 
but the pace will be slower than in countries such as Poland and 
Czechoslovakia. Antipathy toward the Bulgarian Turks may produce ethnic 
upheavals as hard-liners resurrect long-dormant differences. 
</P>
<P>
 -- East Germany: Change is occurring rapidly. Travel may not be as smooth, 
even in parts of West Germany, as Americans are accustomed to. Expect 
occasional delays. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Romania: Elation over the toppling of Ceaucescu has given way to new 
difficulties as this long-suffering country tries to build a democracy. The new 
struggle is between the old elite that would like to regain the reins of power, 
and those who want to establish a real democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Travel should open more in coming months, but the possibility of more 
demonstrations, and even violence, still exists. Contact the U.S. Embassy in 
Bucharest for current information. 
</P>
<P>
For more information on safety concerns in countries you may be visiting, 
contact the Citizens Emergency Center, U.S. Department of State, Washington, 
D.C. 20520, (202) 647-5225.

AMERICAN 'ADVENTURERS' IN CANADA ARE NOT INTO ROUGHING IT ALL DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Americans may admire Canada from afar for its rugged mountains, its empty 
wilderness, its pine-lined roads where a motorist can hum along for hours 
without seeing another car. But Canadian tourist-market researchers say that 
when Americans sit down to plan a trip to Canada, they tend to look for ways to 
dress up their "wilderness experience" with a touch of class. 
</P>
<P>
"As opposed to hiking Mt. Everest, they want to walk out on a glacier in the 
afternoon or do a little salmon fishing -- and then they want to retire to a 
five-star ship with a gourmet chef, a fine wine list and all the accouterments 
of a great resort," said Rick Skinner, a spokesman for Seattle-based Holland 
America Lines/Westour, a concern that books near-shore cruises from Vancouver 
to Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Canadian market analysts also have noticed that while Americans say they want 
to enjoy Canada's clean air and pristine lakes, they don't want to spend much 
time or energy getting into the outback. 
</P>
<P>
"They want the outdoor experience very quickly," said Tracey Arial, a 
spokeswoman for the Ontario Provincial Ministry of Tourism. "You can tell by 
the kind of packages that are being developed." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the term soft adventure has become something of a buzz word in the 
Canadian travel industry these days, as operators respond to America's 
new-found taste for wilderness pamperings. 
</P>
<P>
Ontario boasts several resorts where visitors can vanish into the wilderness, 
live in a cottage surrounded by pines and blueberry bogs -- yet never be out of 
shouting distance of a French chef. 
</P>
<P>
Arrowhon Pines, for instance, is known in the resort industry for its 
cosmopolitan cuisine, yet it's in the middle of 3,000-square-mile Algonquin 
Provincial Park amid moose, foxes and wolves. 
</P>
<P>
Rates for cottages at Arrowhon are about $115 per person a day, double 
occupancy, including three meals in a central lodge. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the Domain of Killien, near Haliburton, Ont., consists of log 
cottages on a 5,000-acre private estate; guests can choose whether they want 
their rustic abodes equipped with Jacuzzis or fireplaces. 
</P>
<P>
Prices start at about $90 per person a day, double occupancy, and includes 
breakfast and dinner. 
</P>
<P>
There is also "fly-in fishing," in which a resort supplies its guests with 
helicopter or bush-plane shuttles to remote lakes. In some cases, Arial said, 
"You fish a lake that's never been fished before." 
</P>
<P>
One fly-in fishing operator, Ramsey Airways in Sudbury, Ont., will fly a party 
to Lake Obabika Lodge, where guests can fish all day, enjoy dinner cooked by a 
Swiss chef at sundown and retire to their Jacuzzi and VCR-equipped cabin by 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Round trip bush-plane air fare for two from Sudbury would be about $303, says 
Ramsey Airways owner Bob Merrilees, and a week at the resort would cost about 
$1,190, including everything from meals to boats to guides. 
</P>
<P>
(Air fare for a larger group would cost more because they would need a larger 
plane.) Merrilees adds that he can still accommodate tourists who want an 
authentic adventure instead of a soft one, by flying them to outpost camps 
inaccessible to anything but plane and canoe, and leaving them to fend for 
themselves in the wild. 
</P>
<P>
In roadless northern Manitoba, soft adventure seekers arriving by train or 
plane can ride out onto the tundra in "tundra buggies," large vehicles that 
move about on treads, to watch the annual fall migration of polar bears down 
off the polar ice for hibernation. 
</P>
<P>
In summer they can brave the chilly waters of James Bay aboard sonar-equipped 
boats, and listen to the underwater voices of passing whales. 
</P>
<P>
In the Maritime provinces, bed-and-breakfast proprietors are cashing in on the 
"soft adventure" market by setting up shop in historic sea-captains' houses. 
</P>
<P>
One canoeing service in Nova Scotia will take tourists onto the open ocean in 
the tiny boats, paddling from island to island, digging clams and picking beach 
peas for sustenance along the way. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't get any of the rough stuff," Nova Scotia Department of Tourism 
spokesman David Harley was quick to point out. "You're always in sight of the 
land. That's where we're heading, going into the '90s. Soft adventure." 
</P>
<P>
Canadian tourism officials expect about 13.4 million Americans to travel to 
Canada this year, although they note that the figure may be padded somewhat by 
Americans making more than one trip. 
</P>
<P>
Travel analysts say that the lion's share will be going to Ontario, as usual, 
but the tourism growth rate in the Western provinces -- which actively court 
California tourists -- may grow slightly faster than the rate for the nation as 
a whole. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Alberta, who preside not only over the scenic and successful Banff 
and Lake Louise but also over a huge new dinosaur museum with thousands of 
fossils, say they expect a 6% gain in the number of American visitors this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
And British Columbia, which normally vies with Quebec as the nation's No. 2 
province for tourism, has edged out its rival with about 3 million visitors 
from the United States and other countries last year. 
</P>
<P>
Western Canada's current popularity is due, in part, to the name Vancouver made 
for itself four years ago when it hosted Expo '86 and improved its harbor as a 
cruise terminal. "Vancouver has become one of the largest cruise destinations 
in the world for summertime," said Holland America's Skinner. "All the major 
cruise lines have ships in the area." 
</P>
<P>
Western Canada is also cashing in on America's current fascination with Alaska. 
Howard Clifford of Princess Tours in Seattle said his firm's sales of Alaska 
cruises grew by 35% last year; he expects similar growth this year. 
</P>
<P>
Americans buying Princess cruises out of Vancouver often make overland side 
trips into the Canadian Rockies, Clifford said. And other Americans cruise to 
Alaska first, then travel inland to Canada's Yukon to see historic gold-rush 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
"There are good hotels in the area now, which was a problem in the past," 
Clifford said, adding that transportation has improved of late, too, because an 
old freight railway once used for hauling ore that was closed in the mid-1980s 
has been refitted and opened for passenger use. "They're still using the old 
gold-rush rail cars," he said. "Some of them must be 85, 90 years old." 
</P>
<P>
Holland America, for its part, books cruises on three new four-mast sailboats, 
the Wind Star, the Wind Song and the Wind Spirit, whose sails are furled and 
boom swung around by computer. 
</P>
<P>
The ships sail from Vancouver to Juneau, from Prince Rupert, B.C., to Juneau, 
or from Prince Rupert to Los Angeles. Prices are from $2,095 to $2,495 per 
person, double occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
Robin Tauck, marketing manager of Tauck Tours, a Westport, Conn., firm 
specializing in tours to Canada, said the Canadian Rockies is "one of the 
hottest areas" this year. 
</P>
<P>
Tauck Tours is in on the soft adventure boomlet with "heli-exploring" sorties 
into the Canadian Rockies. In heli-exploring, Tauck's summer tourists fly into 
remote mountain hideaways and stay at resorts inaccessible by road and 
previously known only to wealthy, winter-time, powder-skiing aficionados. 
</P>
<P>
Tauck noted that her firm has been offering such trips for nearly a decade, but 
has seen them take off only in the last couple of years. She believes the spurt 
in popularity may be linked to the increasingly good physical condition of 
elderly Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"The older market is healthier and more active," she said. "They don't always 
want to be in a motor coach." 
</P>
<P>
Tauck and virtually everyone else in the Canadian travel industry warn that 
Americans thinking of visiting Canada should book all reservations well ahead. 
With a brief summer, the tourist season is short in Canada, and the hotel 
industry has been slow to build new tourist-class hotels, knowing that they 
will stand empty during the long, forbidding winter. 
</P>
<P>
That means there are room shortages during summer months. Tourists who don't 
book ahead may find themselves driving for long hours on lonely country roads, 
seeing nothing but "No Vacancy" signs. 
</P>
<P>
Over the longer term, Canadian tour operators are also worried about economic 
policy changes that may reshape tourism to some degree. Canada wiped some 
scenic but heavily subsidized passenger trains off the map this year to save 
money, and tourism promoters fear that other Canadian trains may follow them 
into oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Fowler, general manager of Rail Travel Center Tours in St. Albans, Vt., 
said he is "having an extraordinary year for Canada because people are 
concerned that this may be the last year they can ride the train all the way 
across Canada." 
</P>
<P>
In the same way, hoteliers, tour operators and others are nervously eyeing the 
government's plans to begin levying a 7% sales tax next year. The government 
has maintained that the tax won't drive up prices, but those in the tourist 
industry are skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the year to go to Canada, because next year we're going to have a new 
goods and services tax," said Harley, the Nova Scotia tourism spokesman.

TOO MANY DOSES OF X-RAYS CAN MAKE FILM SICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEFFINGWELL, Leffingwell is a Los Angeles Times staff photographer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Either we X-ray or you leave the airport." 
</P>
<P>
These words, feared by photographers, often are heard these days at London's 
Heathrow Airport, one of the most security conscious in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Rothfeld, a Santa Monica-based free-lance travel photographer, has heard 
them twice in recent months. Los Angeles Times staff photographer Kirk McKoy 
received the same ultimatum while stopping over at Heathrow after a recent trip 
to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"With a deadline to meet, a plane to catch and two months' work in my camera 
bag," Rothfeld said, "I swallowed hard and handed over the film in several 
sealed plastic bags. It went through without a problem." 
</P>
<P>
McKoy, on the other hand, was carrying his film in lead bags to protect it from 
X-ray damage and was delayed for 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"The lead bags showed up as black blobs on the screen, so inspection by hand 
was necessary," McKoy said. "But I had 40 rolls still in factory packages. 
Every roll had to be opened before the inspectors would let me board." 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, professional photographers who travel a great deal have more to lose 
in terms of film ruined by X-rays, but even the amateur on vacation wants to be 
certain that his or her photographs are not at risk. 
</P>
<P>
Do X-rays hurt film? 
</P>
<P>
How can the traveler prevent that happening? 
</P>
<P>
Are there countries where the problem is more serious than elsewhere? 
</P>
<P>
Is there an international X-ray standard that must be met? 
</P>
<P>
These and other questions were asked of several photographers, some of whom 
reported experiencing long delays and even missed flights because of film 
inspection procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, exposure to X-rays can harm film. Yes, there are ways of preventing that 
damage. Yes, some countries, most notably Third World nations, the Soviet 
Union, Hong Kong and Japan, use technology that can be more harmful than that 
used in the United States. And, no, there is no international standard that 
must be met. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, however, does have a standard, one that precludes airport 
X-ray machines from harming film. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) standard is one milli-Roentgen (mR) 
per exposure. At U.S. airports, X-ray machines should not exceed that amount. 
</P>
<P>
However, this was not always the case. Jim Walsh, technical associate with 
Eastman Kodak in Rochester, N.Y., said he had heard in the past of 10mR and 
even 50mR devices. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen photographic results that indicate that kind of high exposure," 
Walsh said. "I've seen camera parts clearly shadowed on film." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh said that one exposure at 34mR will result in noticeable damage to ASA 
100 film. 
</P>
<P>
But the possibility of damage also depends on the type of film. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, X-ray sensitivity hinges on film structure," Walsh said. "If the 
film is fine-grain and has relatively low sensitivity to visible light, the 
sensitivity to X-ray is similar. But there are other confounding issues. And 
the increase in X-ray sensitivity does not parallel the increase in film 
speed." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, film's sensitivity to X-rays rises slower than the rise in film 
speed. In other words, ASA 400 film (which is what most amateur photographers 
use) is not four times more sensitive than ASA 100. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor to remember is that X-ray exposure is cumulative. The more times 
your film is exposed to X-rays, the more likely it will be damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Kodak monitors X-ray sensitivity and assumes acceptable standards of five 
exposures. Anything more than that and there could be problems. 
</P>
<P>
So what can you do to protect your vacation travel pictures? 
</P>
<P>
In the United States it is generally possible to ask for and receive inspection 
by hand. You cannot count on the same cooperation overseas. 
</P>
<P>
The only defensive strategy to follow is somewhat involved but, considering the 
time and money invested in travel, is worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
Before you leave home, remove all the packaging from the film. Take as many 
rolls as you think you might shoot, but also add a couple of high-speed rolls 
even though you may not use them. Put all the film in clear plastic bags. 
</P>
<P>
Moderate amounts should be carried in your camera bag. Larger quantities can be 
packed in luggage, all in the same suitcase (thus simplifying inspection, if 
necessary), inside lead bags. Use the plastic bags, too, so you can quickly 
pull all the film out in one self-contained bundle when the black blobs appear 
on the X-ray screen. 
</P>
<P>
Arrive at security well in advance of your flight. Take a moment to watch the 
lines and see which security personnel seem most relaxed and polite. When the 
crowd has thinned, politely tell the inspector that you have high-speed film, 
that you will be traveling on several flights and that you are concerned about 
cumulative X-ray doses. Sometimes, that is enough to get your film inspected by 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
Never lose your patience. If your pleas fail, suggest that security run a roll 
or two through the X-ray to show them you have nothing to hide. Or, if you have 
a language problem, before you go to security contact a representative of the 
airline to translate your request. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, one can always abandon film and shoot video instead. It is totally 
unaffected by X-ray. 
</P>
<P>
One word of warning, though: Keep the video away from the magnetic metal 
detectors. They can scramble or even erase your vacation.

YOUTH BEAT: STUDENTS PLANNING TO HEAD FOR EASTERN EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON, Izon is a Canadian travel journalist covering youth budget 
routes.

<TEXT>
<P>
London's hot, China's not. And, like everyone else, young travelers are 
expressing interest in exploring the newly opened countries of Eastern Europe. 
Those are the major youth trends this summer, according to leading 
international student travel bureaus. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of STA Travel (Student Travel Australia), which has 120 offices 
worldwide, expect that attractive air fares will encourage student-style 
travelers to use London as their gateway to Europe this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Shop around and compare both prices and restrictions on air fares before 
booking. It's often in your best interest to check directly with youth travel 
bureaus. Because of high volume, the bureaus often are able to make especially 
good arrangements to certain destinations. Sometimes these deals are not 
advertised. 
</P>
<P>
For those heading on to Eastern Europe, it may be hard to get up-to-date 
information. To keep yourself informed, contact tourist information offices and 
consulates (ask your travel agent for addresses), make inquiries at student 
travel bureaus and network with other independent travelers. If you are 
concerned about safety, inquire at your embassy for any travel advisories. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the German National Tourist Office advises that "things are 
changing daily." Travelers who want to make day-trips to East Berlin will find 
that there are more crossing points than before and the visa process is faster. 
The visas, which are issued at the border, cost 15 marks (about $9.50 U.S.). 
</P>
<P>
It is no longer necessary to spend a minimum of 25 marks a day when you cross 
to East Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Travel services affiliated with the International Youth Hostel Federation are 
good sources of information. More than 3,000 internationally affiliated youth 
hostels are in Eastern and Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-January the federation pulled together representatives of 15 European 
associations for an urgent meeting to respond to developments. Their concern 
was how to keep costs down for young Eastern Europeans traveling in the West, 
and the further development of facilities -- plus the circulation of 
information -- for travel in the East. 
</P>
<P>
The federation produces a listing of all its hostel sites in Europe and the 
Mediterranean, the "1990-91 Guide to Budget Accomodation Handbook" ($12.95), 
which is sold at youth hostels worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
For detailed background information, independent travelers may consider buying 
a copy of the 667-page "Eastern Europe on a Shoestring" by David Stanley 
($14.95). Published for the first time last year, it's packed with information 
and 195 maps. 
</P>
<P>
Student-style travelers also will be able to find background information about 
key centers in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, 
Romania, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, all of which are included in the 1990 
edition of "Let's Go: Europe" (Harvard Student Agencies, $13.95). 
</P>
<P>
Tour operators catering to the student and youth market also have been 
introducing new Eastern European programs, or adding Eastern European stops to 
established itineraries. 
</P>
<P>
STI Travel, the Los Angeles-based company specializing in travel for 18- to 
30-year-olds, has added stops in Prague, Berlin and Vienna to three of its 
established tour routes. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-day "Romantic" tour starts at $929 (air fare extra), and also visits 
London, Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam. The 21-day "Classic" tour starts at 
$1,289, and adds stops in Salzburg, Venice, Florence and Rome. The 31-day 
"Magic" tour starts at $1,963 and continues on to Sorrento, Capri and Athens, 
the departure point for a four-night stay on Mykonos. 
</P>
<P>
Details are covered in STI's 1990 "Europe Book."For copies, contact STI Inc.,

MEMENTOS OF SAN MARINO, THE 'SOUVENIR STATE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MORGAN, Morgan is a magazine and newspaper writer living in La Jolla. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a certain decor that I call "European Country Mellow." It usually 
means an open hearth and candlelight, copper pots and paned glass. It goes with 
good regional cooking and a warm welcome. When I find it in a restaurant or an 
inn, I feel at home. 
</P>
<P>
That is the cozy style of Taverna Righi, on the sundown side of the tiny 
European country of San Marino. The upstairs dining room has the necessary 
copper pots and terra cotta planters. Handpainted ceramic plates gleam against 
rough white walls that are framed in wooden beams. 
</P>
<P>
Crisp tablecloths are the color of salmon. On the wall above the hearth is a 
beaten copper mural that shows a stagecoach coming up the steep road to this 
hilltop state, a land surrounded by Italy. 
</P>
<P>
I was there on a cool spring night. Only two other tables were filled. On a tip 
from the owner -- Giovanni Righi -- I ordered a pasta prepared with salvia, 
which is fresh sage. 
</P>
<P>
In the center of the room was a table laden with wonders from the kitchen: 
plates of antipasti, bowls of crinkled lettuce, salmon, cheese, strawberries 
and pastries. The backdrop was a three-tiered sculpture of San Marino's walls 
and turrets. The sculpture was made of bread. 
</P>
<P>
The Taverna Righi overlooks the flagstones of the Piazza de la Liberta with the 
required bell tower -- one is always near places of European Country Mellow 
decor. At 8:30 p.m. I heard the bells: eight deep tolls from a big bell, and 
two merry plinks to mark the quarter hours. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the piazza and beyond distant ragged hills the sun was setting in a 
burst of blood red. It reflected on the copper and the lanterns and the walls. 
</P>
<P>
It was the end of my first day in this ancient place, a collectible among 
nations and rife with idiosyncrasies. RSM -- as it is designated on oval bumper 
stickers -- claims to be the smallest independent state in the world. It covers 
23 square miles on the slopes of Mt. Titano, a rugged escarpment that juts 
2,500 feet above the Adriatic. 
</P>
<P>
The republic boasts a standing army of 120, as if acknowledging that there is 
little room to sit down. Its national anthem has bold music but no words, an 
economy that also seems fitting. 
</P>
<P>
I had driven east that morning from Florence and followed the red-brick road 
that winds toward the thousand-year-old ramparts. 
</P>
<P>
San Marino is a medieval museum, a souvenir state that thrives on tourism and 
the mementos that travelers covet. Crooked lanes bristle with heraldic banners 
and T-shirt stands. High on a shopping list are elegant postage stamps that 
feature lacy flowers, San Marino coins and, for reasons not altogether 
inappropriate, the faces of Mickey Mouse and Walt Disney. 
</P>
<P>
If San Marino were to have a sister state -- a place of like spirit and 
goodwill -- it could be Disneyland. Both are fanciful settings and 
astonishingly clean. Both draw their biggest crowds on summer weekends. 
</P>
<P>
San Marino, too, lives by costumes and parades. The oldest military order, the 
crossbowmen, dates from the 1300s. First trained to defend the mountaintop, the 
crossbowmen now practice the sport for international competitions. Crossbows, 
from key chain miniatures to chest-high models, fill the gift shops. 
</P>
<P>
Blue and white, the national colors, are everywhere, even on skimpy monogrammed 
towels at the Grand Hotel San Marino. A room sign warns souvenir hunters: "The 
chambermaid is responsible for two hand towels, two bath towels and two 
washcloths. If any are missing at checkout time, the maid must pay." 
</P>
<P>
Of course I did not dare. I would no more steal in a land of crossbowmen than 
I'd sing their national anthem.

PARISIAN PARKS ARE WHERE TO FIND FRENCH SHOWING THEIR TRUE COLORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM HALL KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Post-Impressionistic French painter Georges Seurat illustrated a century 
ago, there is nothing better than a day in the park for a relaxed, intimate 
portrait of Paris and its people. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, the particular park on the banks of the Seine where Seurat painted his 
distinctive pointillist masterpiece, "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La 
Grande Jatte," has been elbowed aside by the growth of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
But there remains within the city a wealth of other parks where on a bright 
day, preferably on a weekend, you can revel in the varied landscaping; stroll, 
promenade or jog; picnic on the grass, snack at a stand or dine luxuriously in 
a restaurant; or simply find a chair or a bench, or sit under a tree, lean back 
and observe the passing scene. 
</P>
<P>
My appreciation of the city's parks was heightened considerably a few years ago 
when my wife and I, accompanied by our then-15-month-old son Josef, took an 
apartment in Paris. Josef's need of at least one extended romp a day and our 
desire to experience a Paris beyond the usual tourist attractions combined into 
an diverting exploration of the city's scattered parks and playgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
To me, the parks of Paris are where residents shed their reputedly brusque 
manners, along with their ties or high heels, to play with their children, 
treat them to a merry-go-round or pony ride, read the weekend paper or a book, 
indulge in a game of chess, go rowing, kick a soccer ball, flirt or merely doze 
away a warm afternoon. It is in parks, I believe, that the Parisians become 
real people, at ease with the world and more tolerant of tourists. 
</P>
<P>
Parisian parks vary, reflecting in the differences their rich histories, the 
pretensions of their neighborhoods and the proclivities of nearby residents. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps no park demonstrates this better than the Luxembourg Gardens. A 60-acre 
oasis of green located in the heart of the Left Bank, it was designed in the 
formal French manner of straight paths, edged by disciplined trees, pampered 
flower beds and manicured lawns. Among the park's 90 odd -- some very odd -- 
monuments is a 9-foot-high model of the Statue of Liberty by Frederic Auguste 
Bartholdi, who lived and worked a few blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
The park's focal point is a marvelous octagonal-shaped basin and fountain 
around which you can sit and watch children of all ages launch toy sailboats 
and remote-controlled boats. There is a wealth of other diversions, including 
tennis and boule courts, playgrounds, pony rides, a marionette theater, a chess 
pavilion, a modest cafe and restaurant and the usual scrumptious snack stands. 
</P>
<P>
Bordering the park on the north is the Luxembourg Palace, built in a flamboyant 
Italian-style in the early 17th Century for Queen Marie de Medici to remind her 
of the Pitti Palace of her native Florence. Over the years it has served as a 
monastery, a prison for those who were to be guillotined during the Reign of 
Terror, a parliament house, headquarters for the German Luftwaffe stationed in 
France during World War II, and, at present, the home of the French Senate. 
</P>
<P>
But what makes the Luxembourg Gardens special is the broad cross section of 
people who frequent it. On a given weekday morning, even when the skies are 
gray and the air nippy, the park attracts joggers, mothers and nannies with 
young children, chess players and solitary citizens with books; at lunchtime, 
tastefully dressed politicians and legislative aides from the Senate, 
executives and secretaries from nearby offices, and tourists eating alfresco; 
in the afternoon, older children, teen-agers and more-senior citizens; and 
throughout the day waves of students from the nearby Sorbonne. It is the 
students studying, arguing, and romancing that adds a special Parisian 
ambience. 
</P>
<P>
For me, Sunday is the Luxembourg's best day, when it seems that everyone is 
there; the students, the bon chic yuppies and their bon chic babies, the 
grandparents, the tourists and the inevitable park wardens keeping an eye on 
everything and making sure that only children under 6 (and their guardians) 
play on certain patches of grass, that no one picks the flower displays that 
are constantly being redone, and that everybody is out of the park half an hour 
before sunset so that the ornate, gold-paint-tipped gates can be locked. 
</P>
<P>
More sedate, reflecting its residential surroundings in the fashionable 17th 
Arrondissement, and more fanciful is Parc Monceau, which was designed in 1778 
for the Duke of Orleans by the artist Carmontelle as a land of dreams. He 
scattered across the undulating English-styled landscape a pyramid, a pagoda, a 
Roman temple and a colonnade, among other follies. By far the most diverse and 
diverting park in Paris is the 2,224-acre Bois de Boulogne. Here there is 
something for everyone; gardens for "taking the air," woods for hiking and 
bird-watching, meadows for picnics and kite flying, fields for soccer and an 
occasional softball game, tennis courts, a range for clay-pigeon shooting, the 
famed Longchamp for thoroughbred racing, and Autiel, the steeplechasing track. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the Bois, as it is popularly known, are bicycle paths, lakes for 
rowing, a children's amusement park, including a zoo and and farm; a more 
informal and dubious adult amusement area, where soliciting prostitutes gather 
at dusk; and a range of restaurants to satisfy the gourmand and gourmet, as 
well as three generations of a bourgeois family out for a Sunday feast, or a 
romantic couple seeking anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
My favorite area in the park is the Bagatelle, a collage of formal and informal 
gardens, groves of trees, rolling lawns, sculpted, shadowed lakes and a 
waterlily pond that brings to life scenes of an idealized French countryside 
that could have been painted by any of the great Impressionists. Particularly 
ethereal are the rose gardens, especially if you catch them in full bloom in 
June. Beckoning after a stroll through this idyll is a cafe under a canopy of 
oaks in a courtyard behind a petite chateau that was built in 1775 as a 
plaything for Marie Antoinette. 
</P>
<P>
What the Bois de Boulogne is to the haute west side of Paris the sprawling Bois 
de Vincennes is to the robust east side. Both serve as a reflection and a 
refuge. Here, dogs and children roamed, the laughter at family picnics seemed 
louder, the wine and food appeared more hearty, the music at the free concerts 
louder, the play in the soccer games rougher and the lovers in the woods 
bolder. 
</P>
<P>
Yet with its lakes, floral and tropical gardens, meandering walks and deep 
forests, an impressive zoo, biking and horseback riding and historic chateau 
dating to the 14th Century, the park could also be diverting and genteel. 
</P>
<P>
Almost everywhere we went in the city we found an inviting park or playground, 
where we could sit and enjoy the surroundings. There was, for instance, the 
square around the corner from the Picasso Museum. 
</P>
<P>
I forget its name, but not the memory in my mind's eye of the sun streaming 
through the trees there, creating a play of light and shadows on the lawn, 
flower beds, the people sitting on the benches and the children playing in the 
sandbox. I remember thinking at the moment that I didn't need to go to one of 
the nearby museums to view the art, for the scene in the square was in itself a 
memorable portrait of Paris.

EUROPE HAS THE BLANKETS, BUT BRING YOUR SHEETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THEASA TUOHY, Tuohy is an editor for the Associated Press. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The minor item of sheets is one of the major differences between Americans and 
Europeans in their attitude toward vacations. 
</P>
<P>
That's right. 
</P>
<P>
Sheets. Bed linens. 
</P>
<P>
The French, the English, the Germans and other nationalities have known for 
years the pleasures of renting someone else's home or apartment for a month of 
lolling around or puttering in the garden without a hectic tour schedule to 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
Americans have begun to drift in that direction, and a new guide just published 
can be a big help in figuring out how to go about renting a villa in Tuscany or 
an apartment in London. 
</P>
<P>
The catch, however, is that you often must take your own sheets. 
</P>
<P>
The European attitude seems to be that Americans are sissies. 
</P>
<P>
"You Yanks, you're spoiled. You want everything done for you," said an English 
friend in response to my amazed reaction when told that one hauls along one's 
own sheets when renting an otherwise furnished private home in France. 
</P>
<P>
"We have houses renting for $30,000 a month, and they won't throw in the 
linens," said Barry Shepard, general manager of At Home Abroad of New York. 
</P>
<P>
Shepard said his company can make arrangements to rent sheets in most, but not 
all, of the countries where they have rentals. 
</P>
<P>
In France, for example, he said the cost is about $150-$200 a month, per 
couple, including laundering. 
</P>
<P>
Outrageous as that may sound, there is a certain logic behind it. The price of 
sheets is truly exorbitant in France. 
</P>
<P>
Last September I walked into Gallerie Lafayette in Montpellier and told the 
salesgirl I wanted two of the cheapest white single sheets they had, and the 
bill was 250 francs. At an exchange rate of a bit over six francs to the 
dollar, that is more than $41. 
</P>
<P>
The situation is similar in other European countries, where the average person 
has traditionally made do with sheets of a very course quality of cotton. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Trodd, a transplanted Englishman who has lived in Alabama long enough to 
have picked up American ways, if not a Southern accent, says he's been trying 
to teach his British colleagues in the cottage rental business a little about 
how to market to Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"We supply complete linen in every one of our cottages," said Trodd, owner of 
Heart of England Cottages, a rental agency based in Eufaula, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
He said he marvels at the shortsightedness of European marketers who could just 
as easily buy sheets and raise their rent to cover the cost. 
</P>
<P>
"How's an American family going to get on an overseas flight with enough towels 
and bed linens for everyone for a week, or a month?" Trodd asked. 
</P>
<P>
"If they don't provide sheets, find a place that does," advised Michael Murphy, 
one of the authors of "A Traveler's Guide to Vacation Rentals in Europe," 
($10.95; E.P. Dutton, New York). 
</P>
<P>
The guide covers apartments, villas, cottages, chalets, farmhouses and 
condominiums. Such accommodations can save you 20% to 40% over the cost of a 
hotel, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
If you're willing to cook rather than dine out, the savings can be 50% to 70%. 
</P>
<P>
Moti Benami, president of Hometours, a New York City agency that handles 
B&amp;Bs in New York, London and France, as well as rentals of apartments, 
villas and chalets in Europe, New York and Israel, said he advises clients that 
if just two people are staying at least a week, they can rent an apartment in 
London cheaper than they can get a B&amp;B.

BARGAIN CORNER: RAIL PASS OFFERS FLEXIBILITY ON TRAVEL TO SWITZERLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK ADLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SwissRail's Flexipass offers three days of unlimited rail travel within a 
15-day period, and includes boat travel on some lakes and the use of buses. The 
three days do not have to be consecutive. It costs $149 first-class and $99 
second-class. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to mix rail and car travel, look into the Swiss Rail/Drive Pass 
that offers three days of unlimited rail travel and two days' use of a Hertz 
rental car within a 15-day period. The five days, whether by rail or car, don't 
have to be consecutive. 
</P>
<P>
Rates depend on the car and whether it's for one or two persons. Lowest rate 
for two people on first-class rail travel is $179 per person; second-class, 
$129. On a solo basis, with first-class rail travel, the rate is $249; 
second-class costs $199. 
</P>
<P>
There is no mileage charge and the cars can be dropped off anywhere in 
Switzerland. Reservations should be made at least seven days before departure 
from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The regular Swisspass allows unlimited rail travel for eight or 15 consecutive 
days within a month. The eight-day pass costs $180 first-class, $125 
second-class. The 15-day pass is $220 first-class, $155 second-class. One-month 
cards cost $300 and $210. 
</P>
<P>
Rail passes cover such famous Swiss trains as the Glacier Express, Bernina 
Express and Wilhelm Tell Express. Pass holders also get a 25% to 50% discount 
on private Alpine railways and cable cars. 
</P>
<P>
The one-month Swisscard, available for $80 first-class and $65 second-class, 
includes round-trip rail transportation from arrival points in Switzerland 
(either at the border or at Zurich or Geneva airports) to a destination within 
the country. Travelers also can buy rail, bus and lake-boat tickets at 50% off 
regular prices during this one-month period. 
</P>
<P>
These passes and cards are good for six months from the date of purchase; the 
time period begins when first used. They have to be bought in the United States 
from travel agents or French Rail, which serves as Swissrail's agent in North 
America. JACK ADLER

In the summer of 1988 I spent an enjoyable week in Pakistan visiting Lahore, 
Rawalpindi and Islamabad. But I had a different experience than Frank Jossi 
("Echoes of an Empire Linger on in Lahore," Jan. 28) with air travel. 
</P>
<P>
Within Pakistan the flights were so cheap that it was difficult to catch 
flights without reservations. In Lahore they told me I could not buy a ticket 
to Gilgit, but must buy it in Islamabad, and then would have to wait at least 
one more day before I could fly. I learned that it usually takes a minimum of 
10 days to reserve a flight to Gilgit, and that if Gilgit is fogged in, flights 
are canceled. I believe there is great demand for Gilgit in the summer to 
escape the heat in lower Pakistan. Most everyone was friendly and helpful. 
</P>
<P>
I couldn't get on any of the flights to Gilgit even though I got up at 4 a.m., 
thinking I had paid for a reservation. About 20 others couldn't get on either.

Ree Strange Sheck's article on the Costa Rica rain forest ("Alone With Nature 
in a Tropic Rain Forest," Feb. 11) has me bemused and confused. In discussing 
plant mimicry, the writer described a passion flower that had leaves with 
Velcro-like hairs "to catch marauding butterfly larvae." Pray, how does a larva 
maraud? I thought they tended to be on the sedentary side.

I would like to paraphrase the headline of Peter Greenberg's Jan. 21 article 
from "High Praise for a Pilot Who Knew, etc." to "High Praise for a Writer Who 
Knows." 
</P>
<P>
In my years of travel and travel reading, I have never read a person who is 
more knowledgeable than Peter Greenberg. My file cabinets are full of his 
articles, and it's evident that he does much research on whatever he writes 
about. His articles touch on subjects no one else writes about, and are of 
great use to a traveler.

THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT SHOOK -- FROM TOKYO TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA; 
</P>
<P>
QUAKES:THE JAPANESE STOCK MARKET TUMBLED DOWN AND AN ALREADY SHAKY LOS ANGELES 
LANDSCAPE MAY SOON FEEL THE AFTERSHOCKS.

<P>
It wasn't the Big One everybody feared, but last week's quake sent pulses 
racing for a while; it seemed as if nothing was stable and the rumbling seemed 
to go on forever. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't the California earthquake that left a crowd of investors feeling 
breathless and pale; it was the financial shock in Tokyo, where stock prices 
fell farther and faster than at any time since the Crash of '87. 
</P>
<P>
After stabilizing briefly early in the week, the Nikkei Index headed south 
again on Thursday, losing more than 2% of its value, and the shock to investor 
confidence will not go away. The Japanese, like the Americans, now understand 
that stock prices can go down as well as up. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo crash won't be good for U.S.-Japan relations. Tokyo market observers 
blamed futures markets and program trading for the new volatility in the 
market; American pressure forced these razzle-dazzle options on the 
conservative Japanese financial Establishment, and foreign security firms still 
dominate trading in the new instruments. This spells trouble; American 
negotiators have a long list of more "market-opening" measures in a 
never-ending quest to export our own increasingly rickety financial system to 
the farthest corners of the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo stock market, where stocks routinely trade at price levels many times 
higher than those of equivalent U.S. or European securities can command, has 
long been due for a correction. Insider trading and conspiracies to raise the 
price of favorite stocks are rampant in a country where stock tips serve as 
political payoffs. Foreign observers have been predicting a major correction 
for years, and the selloff could have been much worse. By Wall Street 
standards, the double-digit drop in the Japanese stock market was a relatively 
mild and orderly affair. 
</P>
<P>
There had been some fears that a sharp drop in Tokyo would set off a global 
explosion like the October, 1987, stock blow-off. Indeed, the most favored 
apocalyptic scenarios of today usually start with the Japanese market. But the 
Tokyo market crashed and the world didn't come to an end. In fact, parts of the 
world hardly noticed. European investors are hypnotized by the historic events 
in the Warsaw Pact countries and don't much care about events in far-off 
Oriental bazaars. Wall Street shrugged off Tokyo, in part because nervous 
Japanese moved this way, getting out of their own market. Worried about a 
sudden weakness in the yen, they put their money into U.S. stocks and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The world may not have come to an end but Tokyo troubles will still have an 
impact on our side of the Pacific. The Tokyo market fell because the Bank of 
Japan thinks Japan's stock and real-estate markets are dangerously inflated. 
Since September, interest rates in Tokyo have been climbing steeply; rates on 
90-day certificates of deposit are 50% higher than they were last year, and 
long-term rates are higher than they have been in five years. 
</P>
<P>
These rates make Japanese stocks and property less attractive to investors, but 
the effects don't stop there. With super-safe 10-year Japanese government bonds 
offering more than 7% interest, a better rate than many American real-estate 
investments can show, canny Tokyo investors may lose their appetite for 
American property. If that should happen, then real-estate markets across the 
United States are headed for trouble, and the Southern California market has 
more to lose than most. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, Southern California was one of a number of booming real-estate 
markets, but one by one the other markets have stagnated or gone downhill. In 
states like Texas, Colorado, Massachusetts and Arizona, only the most inept 
speculators could manage to lose money in real estate. Now all those markets 
are filled with unsalable buildings; homeowners and commercial developers are 
watching their equity erode; the landscape is littered with untenanted office 
buildings alongside savings-and-loans brought low by optimistic lending. 
</P>
<P>
But in California, thanks largely to continuing Japanese interest, prices kept 
rising and now stand at levels substantially above those in other parts of the 
country. It seems unlikely that those inflated differentials can last. With 
both office space and housing significantly more affordable in depressed 
markets like Texas and Arizona, more firms are taking a second look at plans to 
relocate or expand in expensive California. 
</P>
<P>
California and Japan have more in common than a propensity for earthquakes. 
Both were beneficiaries of the great bull market of the 1980s. There was a 
tremendous explosion of asset values in the more fortunate parts of the world 
over the last decade. At the height of the '80s, bull markets were common. The 
art market, junk bonds, commercial real estate -- all soared. It was hard to 
lose money in the halcyon days of the boom. 
</P>
<P>
But with the waning of the '80s, those markets have begun to weaken; now there 
are fewer pastures of plenty where the bulls roam in peace. Among the world's 
stock markets, Tokyo was the last important stomping ground for the 
once-rampant bulls; now bears have been spotted even there. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves California real estate as one of the world's last "sure-thing" 
markets, and there are ominous signs that a new California earthquake -- of 
land values, if not of the land itself -- could bring the good times to a quick 
close. Wall Street is less than bullish about the great bear state; 
California's bank stocks are down on fears of a real-estate shakeout, and 
analysts shake their heads over the short-term prospects of California 
commercial property. 
</P>
<P>
More than the movies, more than defense, real estate is the industry that built 
Southern California and it continues to be the foundation for prosperity. In 
the '80s, real estate grew addicted to foreign capital and now faces the 
prospect of temporary withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
With the defense industries looking at budget cuts, and the financial system 
still reeling from the aftereffects of the junk bond market collapse, Southern 
California may be facing one of its greatest historic tests. 
</P>
<P>
Those who have worried that the Japanese wanted to buy up America may now have 
to cope with a new and much more worrying prospect: that the Japanese might 
want to sell it back.

It is humbling to face the fact that virtually none of the crucial events of 
recent decades -- the Nazi-Soviet pact, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan's rise to 
economic leadership, the advent of glasnost, perestroika and the unraveling of 
communist hegemony in Central-Eastern Europe, to name several -- were 
anticipated. Accordingly, it is difficult to escape the conclusion that what we 
can most confidently expect is the unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
If we recognize and accept the reality that we cannot reliably predict future 
events, should ordinary people be expected to sacrifice their lives and 
liberties in pursuit of certain ends that are likely to prove unattainable? 
Halina Bortnowska, a lay Catholic who has advocated the causes of Polish 
steelworkers, is unequivocal: "We're not laboratory rats here, and really, 
we've had enough of grand experiments. Truly, one mustn't experiment with the 
lives of people who have only one life to live." 
</P>
<P>
Oliver Cromwell said essentially the same thing to the General Assembly of the 
Church of Scotland on Aug, 3, 1650: "My brethren, I beseech you, in the bowels 
of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken." Much more so than in 
Cromwell's time, it behooves us to think of the possibility of being mistaken 
-- to guard against any dogma or set of beliefs that we have elevated above 
reappraisal. In a world changing infinitely more rapidly than Cromwell's, dogma 
must give way to working hypotheses. 
</P>
<P>
One such hypothesis centers on the widely and loudly acclaimed "people power." 
This power was dramatically manifested in 1989 with the breaching of the Berlin 
Wall, the toppling of communist rule in Poland, Hungary, East Germany and 
Czechoslovakia -- and the clamorous assertiveness of subject nationalities, 
including Hungarians in Romania, Romanians in Soviet Moldavia, Germans in 
Poland and Ukrainians and Muslim Central Asians in the Soviet Union. People 
power also overthrew the shah in Iran, Anastasio Somoza in Nicaragua, Ferdinand 
E. Marcos in the Philippines and fueled popular movements against apartheid in 
South Africa and against communist gerontocracy in China. 
</P>
<P>
We are witnessing, then, a participatory impulse on a global scale and not only 
in politics but in all aspects of life, whether in the family, in the 
classroom, in gender relations, in the workplace or in environmental affairs. 
</P>
<P>
This participatory impulse, it should be noted, is discernible throughout 
history, or at least since the appearance of the state, with its division of 
rulers and ruled. Since then, the most influential society of each historical 
period has been the one that reduced the gap between top and bottom by raising 
the level of mass participation. In so doing, these pioneering societies 
attained a qualitatively superior social cohesion and dynamism, enabling them 
to prevail over all other contemporary societies and to stamp their imprint on 
their times. 
</P>
<P>
In our time, we have developed the technological capacity to build a new world 
but have failed to evolve the social capacity for making it a world worth 
living in. We now face the formidable task of taming our creation -- 
technology. In his later years, Bertrand Russell was skeptical that humans were 
up to such a task. He viewed the antics of his fellow humans as comparable to 
those of "apes playing with matches on a petrol dump." 
</P>
<P>
Russell's apprehension may prove justified. Yet a historical perspective that 
encompasses millions of years of prehistory and millennia of history adds three 
basic and positive factors to the equation: the "non-zero-sum effect," the 
"guillotine effect" and the "Paleolithic heritage." 
</P>
<P>
The "non-zero-sum effect" refers to new social relationships made available, 
for the first time, by technology. All previous civilizations have been 
zero-sum civilizations, that is, only finite pies of natural wealth were 
available. Contenders, both within nations (class wars) and between nations 
(state wars), claimed and fought over the pieces. The Roman Empire was typical, 
requiring 80% of the population to work the land to feed 100%. Roman cities 
seem to have been always about three weeks from starvation. This was a zero-sum 
situation: Someone could get more only if others got less. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the situation is precisely the opposite because the main source of 
wealth is not natural resources but scientific knowledge and technological 
know-how. The available pie is potentially no longer finite. As such, we would 
no longer be trapped in a contest in which someone's gain is not another's 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
War and conquest are hardly the road to riches any more, as the Germans and the 
Japanese discovered during and after World War II. The problem we now face is 
not a finite pie that leads to struggle for the largest slice. Thanks to 
labor-replacing technology, it is a large and growing pie resulting in a global 
glut. 
</P>
<P>
The reality of the glut is reflected in chronic overproduction, chronic unused 
capacity and the multitude of overt and covert trade restrictions designed to 
keep out the flood of foreign goods seeking markets. Although the Germans and 
the Japanese were defeated in World War II, they emerged as economic victors 
because of their technological comeback. After this experience, it is unlikely 
that future Germans or Japanese leaders will use the Lebensraum argument for 
war, as Hitler and Tojo did in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is there no longer an economic incentive to wage war, but there is 
also a powerful disincentive not to wage war because of the "guillotine 
effect." There is an old French saying that the guillotine "powerfully focuses 
the mind." When the threat of nuclear winter hangs overhead vividly and 
literally, the guillotine effect is very much a reality. It was evident when 
Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) explained why President Ronald Reagan, who for so 
long had excoriated the Soviet Union, changed his position and signed a treaty 
with Moscow banning medium-range missiles. 
</P>
<P>
"As he (President Reagan) and all of us get older, we realize the threat of 
nuclear weapons to our survival. And the President has reached the conclusion 
that he has to do something about this." In an address at Camp David on April 
14, 1982, Reagan expressed this "no war" conclusion forcefully: "Nuclear war 
cannot be won and must never be fought." 
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was equally emphatic in a Moscow address Feb. 
15, 1987: "The stockpiling and sophistication of nuclear armaments means the 
human race has lost its immortality. It can be regained only by destroying 
nuclear weapons . . . . A nuclear war would leave no problems, and there would 
be no one left to sit at the negotiating table, let alone the negotiating tree 
stump or stone." 
</P>
<P>
Which brings us to our "Paleolithic heritage." Recent anthropological research 
has debunked the once-popular theory that our early ancestors used their 
superior brains and tools to prey on other animals, thereby acquiring a taste 
for flesh and becoming carnivores. Over the millennia, according to this school 
of thought, Homo sapiens became genetically programmed for aggressive behavior. 
Hence, the increasingly bloody conflicts throughout history, culminating in the 
two world wars and the holocausts of the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the overwhelming majority of contemporary scientists agree that 
humans, like other animals, formed cooperative kinship societies during the 
Paleolithic millennia precisely because these were so well-suited to their 
survival. Human young are wholly dependent -- not for one year like monkeys or 
three to four years like apes, but for six to eight years. The survival of the 
human young during their years of dependency was best secured by a system of 
cooperative base camps that assured the necessary food and protection. 
</P>
<P>
Because communal kinship society met the basic survival needs of our 
prehistoric ancestors, it persisted through the Paleolithic era, which 
encompasses more than 95% of the history of our species. If human societies 
were for so long nonaggressive, scientists reason that the idea of genetically 
determined human aggressiveness is a myth. They consider the violence so 
prominent in modern times to be the product of aggression-promoting conditions 
within society. 
</P>
<P>
Human nature, then, is neither pacific nor violent, neither cooperative nor 
predatory. It is largely determined by "society" or "culture." But society and 
culture are made by humans and can be changed by humans. It follows that future 
societies and future humans will not be determined by genes programmed for 
acquisitiveness or aggression -- as our recent historical experience sometimes 
appears to suggest -- but by people who have the potential to live up to their 
proud and beneficent Paleolithic heritage. 
</P>
<P>
It may be argued that we have little chance of redeeming this heritage because 
our prehistoric ancestors had access to the never-depleted granary of the 
surrounding wilderness. Hence, there was no need for those Paleolithic 
food-gatherers to fight each other for survival. But with the advent of the 
agricultural revolution 10,000 years ago, the ever-full and ever-accessible 
wilderness granary was supplanted by cultivated fields owned by a few landlords 
and worked by landless peasants. This argument persuasively explains the 
unending social conflicts and wars of modern times, but it needs to be carried 
further to take into account modern high technology and its non-zero-sum 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
Today, for the first time in 10,000 years, the ever-accessible wilderness 
granary theoretically can be restored and once more made accessible to all. Our 
Paleolithic heritage now is within reach. Whether we reclaim it depends on our 
ability to make the adaptations necessitated by rampant technology. 
</P>
<P>
Innumerable species have disappeared simply because they were incapable of 
adapting to changing environments. But we humans are responsible for 
environmental changes. So our problem is not one of adapting to an environment 
beyond our control, but one of adapting our human-made environment to our human 
needs. This would appear to be a relatively easy task for self-styled Homo 
sapiens or thinking persons. 
</P>
<P>
While recent experiences warn us to expect the unexpected, as a thinking 
species we do have the option of being the creators rather than the creatures 
of our destiny -- of recharging our history rather than ending it, like 
Russell's apes playing on the petrol dump.

<P>
That the crisis of Soviet communism has ended the Cold War is by now axiomatic, 
but what kind of world will follow is far from clear. The dominant view in the 
West seems to be that upheavals in the communist world have been caused by and 
must be managed by Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The presumed conversion of erstwhile 
adversaries to pluralism and market economics is believed by many to have ended 
not only the Cold War but history itself. 
</P>
<P>
Such views leave the democracies -- at the moment of their greatest triumph -- 
dangerously irrelevant in the emerging world. For the deeper the upheaval of 
the old order, the more urgent is the task of constructing a new one. And in 
the end, the outcome of Gorbachev's revolution is far from clear; it may 
produce, rather than a linear progression toward democracy, chaos -- the 
replacement of one-party rule by one-man rule and repression, or all three in 
succession. 
</P>
<P>
The West diminishes both Gorbachev and itself by giving him all the credit for 
what is happening in the communist world. Gorbachev's policies did not arise 
from a blinding flash of insight; like all serious political leaders he has had 
to respond to necessity. Gorbachev is a remarkable personality who deserves 
great credit for acting courageously to overcome the crisis of his society. But 
the steadfastness of the democracies in resisting communist expansionism over 
four decades is what created the current international environment. Internally, 
three realities have driven the changes in the Soviet Union: economic collapse, 
the difficulty that mature communist systems have in achieving political 
legitimacy and the nationalities problem. Like the popular Russian dolls, each 
of these is nestled within the other. Gorbachev's dilemma is that the ideal 
solution for each is to a considerable extent incompatible with the best 
solution for the others. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet economic crisis is by now familiar; so are the necessary solutions. 
Yet no centrally planned economy has ever managed the transition to market 
economics. The Soviet Union has so far taken only the most tentative steps in 
the direction of price reform and the ending of subsidies, two preconditions 
for the establishment of market economics. China came closest to taking these 
steps but suffered the catastrophe of Tian An Men Square, largely because 
economic reform outgrew the Chinese political institutions' tolerance for it. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid this outcome, Gorbachev is giving top priority to political reform. He 
is in a better position than anyone to gauge two heretofore insuperable 
political obstacles: that the Communist Party is institutionally committed to 
central planning, and that the longer a communist system governs, the more 
surely it deprives its leadership of the moral authority to ask sacrifices of 
its people. No Soviet leader has ever retired voluntarily. Nor has the 
reputation of any Soviet leader other than Lenin survived his own death. A 
society incapable of generating heroes -- or even continuity -- is in no 
position to demand sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's political reforms seek to weaken the resistance of the communist 
bureaucracy by giving him a popular legitimacy. But in Eastern Europe opening 
up the Communist Party has proved its death knell. Democracy requires a belief 
that the contest of ideas will produce something close to the truth. By 
contrast, communists, regarding themselves as the repositories of historical 
truth, consider compromise a bourgeois evasion that dilutes power. Deprived of 
the instruments of state power, East European Communist parties, not designed 
for democratic contest, are disintegrating at the first whiff of open politics. 
</P>
<P>
Because the countries in Eastern Europe had the advantage of a national 
tradition, the collapse of unpopular Communist parties spurred political 
cohesion. But disintegration of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is 
unlikely to have the same result. 
</P>
<P>
For the Soviet Union is an empire, not a national state. Only slightly more 
than half its population is Russian; glasnost has not produced any hint of an 
all-Soviet non-Communist Party. The real political contests are waged inside 
the Politburo and inside the constituent republics. Glasnost tempts Communist 
parties in various republics to become independent of Moscow, a process 
accelerated by opposing parties even more stridently nationalistic. The 
emergence of real pluralism is inhibited because the democratic tradition in 
most of the Soviet Union is highly tenuous. Currents that produced pluralism in 
the West passed Russia by or touched it only tangentially: the struggle between 
Pope and emperor, the Reformation, the Enlightenment, the concept of free 
enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
I believe -- unhappily -- that the least likely Soviet outcome is linear 
evolution to pluralistic democracy and market economics. The relative pluralism 
now emerging may have as its ultimate result a virulent nationalism in the 
constituent republics and, on the all-Soviet level, the replacement of 
one-party rule by one-man rule, in effect making Gorbachev the czar. Once in 
the possession of the trappings of state power, his course, and even more that 
of his successor, becomes unpredictable. It could mean stagnation or worse. 
</P>
<P>
History will always remember Gorbachev for having stood aside while Eastern 
Europe freed itself and for having started the transformation of the Soviet 
state. If the Soviet Union continues to reduce the percentage of its gross 
national product devoted to defense and its retreat from far-flung outposts 
such as Cuba, assistance in speeding the supply of consumer goods and technical 
help -- as sketched by Secretary of State James A. Baker III and proposed by 
Czechoslovakian President Vaclav Havel -- is surely appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
But in the end Gorbachev's most intractable problems will be beyond the reach 
of outside powers. Like all other revolutionaries, Gorbachev could be consumed 
by the process he started. Gearing Western policies largely to the desire to 
"help" Gorbachev would create three points of vulnerability for the West: it 
would tempt Gorbachev to turn his tenure into the principal quid pro quo of 
diplomacy; it would create paralysis in the democracies if he is engulfed by 
consequences of his own achievements, and it would damage the credibility of 
leaders who have staked too much on a single Soviet personality, however 
meritorious. 
</P>
<P>
The most worrisome outcomes of the crisis of communism are two sides of the 
same coin: on the one hand, a return to traditional great Russian repression of 
the nationalities; on the other, the disintegration of an empire built up in 
the 400 years since Ivan the Terrible. 
</P>
<P>
A nationalistic Russia could resume the pressures to which imperial Russia 
subjected all contiguous areas in Europe and Asia for more than 200 years. A 
disintegrating Russia could tempt neighboring countries to restore historic 
ties with their kinsmen or simply to carve up the Soviet Union on the basis of 
traditional expansionism. 
</P>
<P>
The world has suffered so much at the hands of communist ideology that it has 
nearly forgotten how uncomfortable a neighbor czarist Russia had been. Often 
invaded across a flat plain without natural frontiers, Russia grew to identify 
security with pushing out its frontiers as far as possible. However 
understandable, that caused the Russian Empire throughout its history to seek 
to dismantle every power center within its reach: Poland, Turkey, Sweden, the 
Austro-Hungarian Empire, China, India. 
</P>
<P>
One of history's jokes may be that the successors of Lenin will end up holding 
the Russian state together with practices used by heirs of Peter the Great. The 
nationalism of the smaller Soviet republics has already stimulated a virulent 
counterpart in the Russian Republic itself. But Russian nationalism has always 
been repressive and expansionist. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge to the foreign policy of the democracies is to use the hiatus -- 
as Moscow must give priority to domestic problems -- to put in place a security 
system seeking to transcend the historic Russian quest for absolute security, 
which has meant absolute insecurity for everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
In Europe such a system should return Soviet armies to national territory as 
quickly as possible. The intricate balance of arms-control negotiation along 
existing military dividing lines obscures the real problem of establishing a 
realistic political dividing line. But once Soviet troops are returned home, 
such a system must then also strive for an arrangement that genuinely reduces 
Soviet fears of military attack from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
All this must be accomplished while keeping in mind a diametrically opposite 
danger to the peace of the world: the possibility of a break-up of the Soviet 
state. The West can have no more interest in the disintegration of the Soviet 
Union than in its expansion. I would except the Baltic republics. Their 
annexation, never having been recognized by the West in the heyday of Soviet 
power, cannot now be accepted in the period of glasnost and perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
But for the rest, the West must take great care to avoid steps with 
unforeseeable consequences. The collapse of authority in a country that 
possesses tens of thousands of nuclear weapons must be of greatest concern to 
all humanity. The problem is so terrifying, so contrary to traditional notions 
of sovereignty, that it requires cogent study. 
</P>
<P>
Nuclear perils aside, the breakup of the Soviet Union would surely produce an 
extraordinary cycle of violence. Like a movie run in reverse, it could play 
back a brutal two centuries, and in the end draw in all surrounding countries 
whose competition provided the temptation for Soviet expansion in the first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, if Moscow is unable to preserve the Russian state, neither 
Washington nor other democracies are in a position to do so. But the West can 
practice circumspection, while experience must have taught Moscow that there is 
a level of repression that jeopardizes the democracies' domestic support for a 
policy of detente. 
</P>
<P>
Coming to grips with such contradictory prospects will force America to examine 
categories of thought it has historically rejected; to act not with missionary 
zeal but as custodian of an equilibrium, and to adjust policies to the 
fluctuating requirements of a balance of power rather than fixed legal 
principles or a doctrine of collective security. In that sense, the ultimate 
challenge to U.S. foreign policy is philosophical.

NOT THE PRIME-TIME PAYERS; 
</P>
<P>
CAMPAIGNS: THE COST OF TV EXPOSURE IN LOS ANGELES IS MAKING IT TOUGH FOR 
STATEWIDE CANDIDATES TO GET THEIR MESSAGES INTO THE NO. 1 MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Joe Scott, Joe Scott is a Los Angeles political journalist. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's hard to imagine a successful statewide candidacy that did not include 
television advertising in the major markets. But the rising costs of TV time, 
especially in the Los Angeles market, are rapidly becoming prohibitive for most 
candidates seeking statewide office. 
</P>
<P>
Mindful of this, Democratic Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy recently proposed that he and 
the winner of the Republican primary for lieutenant governor split the costs of 
their 30-second TV spots, each contributing up to $500,000. Sens. Marian 
Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) and John Seymour (R-Anaheim), who are seeking the 
nomination, spurned McCarthy's unprecedented idea. But McCarthy's concern about 
high-priced TV time in California and its implications for political campaigns 
and debate deserves bipartisan attention. 
</P>
<P>
Conventional wisdom has it that only the nominees for governor -- Pete Wilson 
on the Republican side, either Dianne Feinstein or John Van de Kamp on the 
Democratic -- will be rich enough to afford frequently aired TV ads in major 
markets. If one of these candidates wanted maximum prime-time exposure in the 
Los Angeles market today -- viewers seeing a 30-second ad at least 10 times -- 
he or she would have to pay $830,000 a week. That price, it should be noted, 
will continue to escalate through the spring. 
</P>
<P>
Yet prime-time exposure is not the most cost-efficent. Bill Carrick and Hank 
Morris, Feinstein's media advisers, spent $450,000 to buy time in six non-prime 
periods in the Los Angeles market. The Feinstein ads began airing in late 
January when she was a virtual unknown here. The spots, of course, propelled 
Feinstein into the lead, the polls show, and may even have changed the 
chemistry of the race. Today, Carrick and Morris would have to pay $750,000 for 
the same result. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates for insurance commissioner or treasurer clearly won't be able to 
raise that kind of money. A possible solution is for TV station managers, out 
of public service, to incorporate candidate debates into their late-afternoon 
news programs or schedule them between 7 and 8 p.m., prime access time. 
</P>
<P>
Short of that, underfunded candidates will have few opportunities to get across 
their message on TV: They can either buy only in Los Angeles, or buy everywhere 
but Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
News that Democratic registration in California has slipped below 50% the first 
time in 56 years may turn out to be a harbinger of worse to come unless the 
party can attract more money. It's not that chairman Jerry Brown isn't out 
raising money. It's that his staff overhead -- 15 registration organizers are 
on the payroll -- is eating up all the receipts. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of party-recruitment costs and lackluster results may be why 
Brown did not renew the party's $7,500 monthly contract with organizer Marshall 
Ganz. Neither side is talking. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Brown must raise $1 million a month to finance his aggressive 
efforts to reverse the party's registration decline. Already, Feinstein and Van 
de Kamp are under pressure to divert funds from their shrinking war chests to 
aid the registration drive. Not surprisingly, the candidates are balking. Which 
means that Brown may have to ask Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and Senate 
President Pro Tem David Roberti for some of the money they have amassed to 
defeat pro-Republican reapportionment efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to meet the party's cash goals in the next six weeks, say informed 
sources, could mean additional staff cutbacks, which could translate into still 
fewer registered Democrats. For Jerry Brown, that would be a major setback.

U.S. LAW: UNRESTRAINED ACTIONS ABROAD ARE AN AGGRESSIVE ASSERTION OF NATIONAL 
PRE-EMINENCE, WITH PERNICIOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.

<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court has just ruled by a 6-3 majority that actions of U.S. 
law-enforcement agents outside the United States are not subject to the 
restraints imposed inside by the Bill of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the Supreme Court finds that American agents abroad are not bound 
by the Fourth Amendment guarantee of the right of the people to be secure 
against unreasonable searches and seizures. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court holds that American national interest is superior to a 
foreign person's claim to security in his or her person and house, and that an 
American agent abroad need seek no warrant for his acts. This being so, no 
restriction is to be placed upon the actions of American agents that is not 
"imposed by the political branches (of the U.S. government) through diplomatic 
understanding, treaty or legislation." 
</P>
<P>
The decision is one more step by American legal officials to assert an 
internationally sovereign U.S. authority. By this, U.S. law is not only applied 
beyond U.S. borders, to persons not U.S. citizens -- and, as in this ruling, 
who may have committed no U.S. crime, or no crime at all -- but this also is 
done in disregard of the constitutional limits upon law enforcement inside the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
How have Americans and their courts arrived at such a position? There seem to 
me two elements in the explanation. The first is the legalism of American 
society, which historically is the product of that concern for constitutional 
order at the roots of the American federal union. There is a preoccupation with 
legal codification and definition throughout American life and government. 
</P>
<P>
Running in parallel with this has been an American puritanism that rejects the 
deliberate hypocrisy practiced by other nations in their secret operations. No 
one in Britain or France thinks that their secret services do not sometimes 
break the law of other countries or commit acts that would be illegal in the 
home country. These things are thought justified by raison d'etat, and 
acceptable so long as the services responsible are under the responsible 
control of elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
Only America expects legally to define, codify -- and proclaim -- the authority 
of its clandestine services to break the law of other countries and to 
disregard international law. Only the United States is capable of conducting 
"covert" operations abroad (like the Contra program) while openly debating them 
in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
This legalism and rejection of hypocrisy is often pronounced as a great 
strength of American democracy. In fact, it produces a steady deterioration in 
the standard of conduct legally permitted the U.S. government and its agents. 
</P>
<P>
When you codify and formally legalize raison d'etat you end, as the United 
States now has done, in legalizing forms of murder (complicity in political 
assassination), housebreaking and theft (in the present case), and acts of 
international aggression and undeclared war. 
</P>
<P>
The force at work behind this obviously is nationalism: the belief that "We're 
No. 1" -- and the rest are zero. It is an aggressive assertion of national 
pre-eminence, with pernicious -- anarchic -- implications for the international 
community. 
</P>
<P>
It is time indeed for a "political branch" of American government, the 
Congress, to restore to the practice of American government that "decent 
respect" for the interests and opinions of the rest of mankind that the 
nation's founders enjoined upon their fellow citizens.

CZECHOSLOVAKIA'S VACLAV HAVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I think many of us are compelled to rethink the history of political events in 
this country since 1970, in light of the great European awakening currently 
under way. Vaclav Havel and the reform movement in Czechoslovakia ("New Life 
for the Old World," Op-Ed Page, Feb. 19) represent the spiritual and 
intellectual force that currently seeks to reunify Europe. The curious fact 
that this is a revolution headed by artists and playwrights lead former Sen. 
Gary Hart to comment that "reform and renewal come from below, not above," and 
that Havel is now president of Czechoslovakia "because during its dark hour he 
remained the conscience of his nation" ("Do Not Await a Messiah," Editorial 
Page, Feb. 17). 
</P>
<P>
Yet America had a revolution and elected an actor as President, who in turn 
restructured the bureaucracy. Where then is our "wisdom, tolerance and 
understanding"? What happened to the "old European concept of human rights," 
which once formed the political foundation of this country? There is no 
evidence of a higher moral purpose in the neglectful domestic policies which 
accompanied the Reagan Revolution. What then does Havel want from America? 
</P>
<P>
As a matter of principle Havel does not want Europe to become a fortress, yet 
he sees the new Europe as smaller. How unlike the current American political 
manifesto which seeks, by continuing military involvement and aid to various 
countries on the front line of communism, to spread and defend our influence. 
</P>
<P>
Havel gives credit to "human rights" as the ideal most responsible for the 
changes in Eastern Europe. He states that this concern started around 15 years 
ago, a time during which the Carter Administration, which first used the 
concept of progress in this area as a tool of foreign policy, introduced the 
term. Perhaps the real revolution in this country started in the 1960s, and for 
some reason took the wrong turn. But it seems to me that the fruits of the most 
recent American Revolution loom small indeed compared with the world one honest 
playwright and the people of his country look to create.

I can't believe how shortsighted everyone -- young and old, rich and poor -- is 
on the subject of education. 
</P>
<P>
No one seems to realize that no matter if children are black, brown, yellow or 
white, they are the future of this nation -- our nation. A few children from 
private schools cannot run an entire nation. Maybe instead of worrying about 
who and how many, we need to concentrate on educating all as best as possible. 
After all, as I was told by my daughter's kindergarten teacher, the only fair 
is in Pomona. Let's stop worrying about "equality" and concentrate on "quality 
education." Maybe this approach will make for more equality.

MEDFLY MANIA: FACTS MIGHT HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Could it be that finally Southern Californians are going to get some solid 
information about the public-health effects of repeated malathion spraying? 
It's almost too much to hope for, but this week scientific experts will get two 
important opportunities to clarify the health implications of the state's 
extensive anti-Medfly pesticide program. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Assembly will hold an unusual meeting of the full house to take 
testimony from researchers and public-health specialists who have studied 
pesticides. The meeting will no doubt attract much newspaper, television and 
radio coverage; here is a chance for state legislators to put the media 
spotlight to more than just self-serving use. They must use the hearing to 
ensure that it answers all of the obvious questions: How complete and credible 
are the many previous studies that indicated malathion posed no significant 
risk to human health? What factors exist in Southern California's current 
environment that might alter the conclusions of such studies? What about future 
preparedness? Is it realistic to suggest, as agricultural officials have, that 
by June the state and federal facilities can produce 400 million sterile flies 
per week so that long-term repeat spraying will never again be necessary? And 
beyond scientific questions, there is the obvious political one: Even if all 
studies show, beyond a reasonable doubt, that spraying has minimal risk, what 
can be done to restore the credibility of the state and county agricultural 
officials who have mismanaged the Medfly public-information campaign in almost 
textbook form? 
</P>
<P>
Their public information blundering was the reason the state formed what is now 
called the Public Health Effects Advisory Committee, a group of more than 20 
physicians, scientists and public-health advocates. The committee held its 
first organizational session recently in Orange County and will meet again 
Thursday in Los Angeles. Its meetings, which are scheduled to occur regularly 
for the next few months, need to be more highly publicized so that those 
interested can attend. The state has rightly included on the panel some experts 
who have raised serious questions about the malathion spraying campaign, 
including representatives of the Sierra Club and the city of Pasadena. If given 
the needed staff support and full authority to pursue all health issues it 
considers relevant, the committee can help inform an impatient and anxious 
community -- one that is not only weary of being bombarded with malathion, but 
with conflicting versions of precisely what the controversial pesticide does.

FOOD LABELING: FAT CHANCE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 1.2 million Americans will have heart attacks this year, and about 
500,000 will die from heart disease. That death toll will exceed, by about 
75,000, the total number of battle deaths suffered by U.S. servicemen in all of 
this century's wars. Can the appalling incidence of heart disease and related 
premature deaths be significantly reduced? They can, if people are ready to do 
a little more to take better care of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a new report prepared by the National Heart, Lung and Blood 
Institute's National Cholesterol Education Program concludes that heart disease 
could be reduced by 20% if Americans simply ate less fats. That's not a new 
idea. What gives it special heft is that this time it comes endorsed by the 
Food and Drug Administration, the American Medical Assn., the American College 
of Physicians and more than 30 other major health groups. That's about as close 
to an expression of unanimous opinion as the medical community is likely to 
produce. 
</P>
<P>
A key point of the report is that everyone from the age of 2 up, whether at 
known risk of heart disease or not, would benefit by cutting down on dietary 
fats and cholesterol. Specifically, no more than 30% of calories eaten should 
come from fats of all kinds. And saturated fats, the kind found in butter, red 
meat, ice cream and tropical oils, shouldn't exceed 10% of calories consumed. A 
basic aim is to lower blood cholesterol levels, which the report says would 
have "unequivocal benefits" in reducing heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
With a little information people can do a lot to limit dietary fats and reduce 
heart disease risks. One essential way of providing that data, the report 
emphasizes, is with expanded food labeling: Just how much total fat, saturated 
fat, cholesterol and calories are there in a can of chili, a take-out pizza, a 
frozen chicken dinner? An increasing number of food manufacturers and 
restaurants are discovering the marketing value of providing such information; 
health sells. Diet isn't the whole answer to lowering heart disease risks; 
eliminating smoking, controlling high blood pressure, getting some exercise are 
all important. But diet is clearly a major component, and knowing more about 
what's in the food we eat is clearly a vital step toward permitting healthier 
choices.

Havel told Congress that the best way the U.S. can help Eastern Europe is to 
help the Soviet Union on its "immensely complicated road to democracy."

But at the same time, Jeffrey Garten (Op-Ed Page, Feb. 20) claimed that "our 
national mood could become defensive, protectionist, even xenophobic" and that 
"the pace of change may have outstripped the ability of our leaders to deal 
with it."

If this is true, then we could lose the chance of the century to heal the 
wounds of a 45-year-old Cold War! Suddenly the Soviets and East Europeans admit

In response to "Havel: A Man in Search of an Ideal," editorial, Feb. 23: 
</P>
<P>
At a time when changes undreamed of are taking place in Eastern Europe, the 
Soviet Union and South Africa, where the human spirit has long been frustrated 
from keeping its tryst with destiny, here appears Czechoslovakia's Havel with a 
soul-stirring message. 
</P>
<P>
Raising questions so profound about our own democracy at a time when over a 
billion people in Burma and China are denied their God-given rights, your 
editorial gave flight to my spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Can the rulers of these two countries, who share a common border, repress their 
people much longer? 
</P>
<P>
"Let me write the newspapers of the land," proclaimed Thomas Jefferson, "and I 
do not care who makes its laws." The Times has done Jefferson, and Havel, 
proud. Those are accolades well-earned.

Cinemax, Thursday at 7:30 a.m. This 1987 film is the best kind of surprise-a 
small, frequently funny, fine-boned film set in the worlds of the theater and 
the movies that unexpectedly becomes a consummate study of love, alienation and 
loss. In a blazing comet of a performance, Sally Kirkland plays a one-time 
Czech movie star in this New York-made film about the irreconcilable pangs of 
exile directed by Yurek Bogayevicz and written by Polish film maker Agnieszka

KCOP, Friday at 8 p.m. John Huston and John Milius joined forces as director 
and writer, respectively, of this whimsical, highly sophisticated mock-heroic 
Western starring Paul Newman in the title role as the tough hoobre who brought 
law and order to the Texas Badlands and became part of the folklore of the Old 
West. Like Arthur Penn's "Little Big Man," this fine and undeservedly 
overlooked 1972 film plays upon our traditional love of the tall tale to 
confront us witt what the cherished myths of the frontier reveal about our- 
selves and our heritage.

KNBC, Monday at 9 p.m. Barry Levinson's 1987 comedy takes its title from a 
group of wheeling-dealing aluminum-siding salesmen in Baltimore in 1963. 
Hilarious, original and gritty, it stars Richard Dreyfuss and Danny DeVito as 
fierce rivals. Not surprisingly, DeVito's wife, Barbara Hershey, proves to be 
the pivotal character.

TMC, Sunday at 7 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m. and 2 a.m.; HBO, Sunday at 8 p.m., 
Wednesday at midnight, Saturday at 10:30 p.m.; Showtime, Monday at 8 p.m., 
Friday at 11 p.m. Melanie Griffith emerged as a star in this 1988 film, which 
ranks as onn of the key comedies of the T80s. Griffith is irresistible as the 
sexy, ambitious blue-collar secretary to the deliciously arrogant Sigourney 
Weaver, and Harrison Ford is the man in the middle. A terrific blend of satire, 
fantasy and romance directed by Mike Nichols and written by Kevin Wade.

TNT, Sunday at 7 p.m. The 1951 Akira Kurosawa classic opened up the Japanese 
cinema to the West and contributed an expression to our language. It's the 
dazzling period story of an alleged rape told from conflicting points of view, 
suggesting the relativity of truth. Kevin Thomas

John Hughes' "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" (NBC, Sunday at 9 p.m.) offers a 
tantalizing fantasy for adults, as well as kids: What if you could fool your 
parents and teachers (or your boss) into thinking you were sick, earning 
yourself a 24-hour free ride from the boredom and responsibilities of real 
life? Unfortunately, Matthew Broderick, in the title role, is so smug and 
invincible that he doesn't give us any chance to root for him. 
</P>
<P>
"Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home" (ABC, Sunday at 9 p.m.) is a rollicking, 
allegorical super-space opera directed by Leonard Nimoy with an irresistibly 
sure touch. 
</P>
<P>
"Cool Hand Luke," that solid but often antic 1967 prison film with Paul Newman 
and an Oscar-winning George Kennedy, returns on KCOP, Monday at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Schroder stars in the new TV movie "A Son's Promise" (ABC, Monday at 9 
p.m.) as a small-town Southern teen-ager who promises his dying mother that he 
will take care of his six younger brothers. 
</P>
<P>
"Inside Moves" (KTLA, Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is a mild, overly theatrical 
Saroyanesque tale in which all of life seems to be concentrated in one seedy 
neighborhood saloon, whose habitues form a sort of extended family. John Savage 
stars in the 1980 film. 
</P>
<P>
The lively 1984 "Runaway" (CBS, Tuesday at 9 p.m.), a Michael Crichton 
'science-fact" adventure, stars Tom Selleck and imagines the worst possible 
kind of handgun, one that shoots microelectronic bullets that are all but 
impossible to escape. 
</P>
<P>
In 1975's "Drowning Pool" (KCOP, Wednesday at 8 p.m.), Paul Newman returns as 
Harper, the tough detective that he first played in the 1966 film of the same 
name, but this film is not nearly as engaging as the original. 
</P>
<P>
John Huston's 1973 "The Mackintosh Man" (KCOP, Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a 
handsome, mellow spy thriller whose end unfortunately is almost as confusing as 
its beginning. Paul Newman stars. 
</P>
<P>
"Night of the Comet" (KTTV, Friday at 8 p.m.) is an amusing and imaginative 
1984 doomsday sci-fi thriller that finds Catherine Mary Stewart gamely fighting 
off zombies. 
</P>
<P>
"Fatal Vision," the suspenseful 1984 film of Joe McGinniss' best-seller about a 
Green Beret doctor (Gary Cole) convicted of killing his pregnant wife and two 
children, airs on KCAL in two parts, Saturday and Sunday (March 11) at 8 p.m.

ROBBERS TAKE BEER, SHOOT CLERK AT STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Walnut convenience store clerk was shot Saturday during an early morning 
robbery in which the suspects took a 12-pack of beer, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Amarinder Singh, 21, of La Puente, was wounded in the right arm and the bullet 
lodged in his rib cage just beneath the skin, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Lt. Mike Langgle. 
</P>
<P>
Singh was taken to Queen of the Valley Hospital in West Covina and released 
later in the morning, said Naginder Singh, the victim's uncle. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very lucky," said Naginder Singh, whose family the victim has lived with 
since leaving his native India in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting has left everybody in the family "scared," the uncle said, and 
they expect that Amarinder Singh will be recovering at home for at least a 
month. "It's a very big wound," Naginder Singh said. 
</P>
<P>
Singh, a La Puente Adult High School student, was wounded after a man, who 
appeared to be in his early 20s, entered the Super C Market and took a 12-pack 
of beer without paying for it, Langgle said. 
</P>
<P>
As Singh headed for the door, a second suspect entered the doorway and asked 
him if he was going to call police, Langgle said. 
</P>
<P>
"The clerk replied, 'Yes,"' Langgle said. "And as he turned back toward the 
counter, a third suspect, who stood in the doorway, fired a single shot which 
struck him in the right arm. 
</P>
<P>
"He did not appear too seriously injured, but it was a flesh wound," Langgle 
added. 
</P>
<P>
The three men drove away in a red Ford pickup truck with chrome wheel rims, a 
white stripe on the side and a camper shell, Langgle said. 
</P>
<P>
Singh reported the robbery to his employer, who notified sheriff's deputies. 
The victim described the second suspect as also being in his early 20s, but 
told authorities that he did not see the third man who fired at him, Langgle 
said.

MORNING BRIEFING: WHEN IT COMES TO BLIND JUSTICE, UMPIRE'S SIGHT IS ALWAYS 
20/20

Dave Hagler, program director for the Los Angeles Sports and the Law chapter, 
is a former referee and umpire who tells the ultimate turnabout-is-fair-play 
story: 
</P>
<P>
"I was driving too fast in the snow in Boulder, Colo., and a policeman pulled 
me over and gave me a speeding ticket. I tried to talk him out of it, telling 
him how worried I was about insurance, etc., and he said I should go to court 
and try to get it reduced or thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
"The first game of the next baseball season, I'm umpiring behind home plate and 
the first batter up is the same policeman. I recognize him, he recognizes me. 
He asks me how the thing went with the ticket. I tell him, 'Swing at 
everything.' " 
</P>
<P>
Just asking: If the position of catcher is so demanding, how is it that Bob 
Boone, Carlton Fisk and Rick Dempsey, all in their 40s, are still playing? 
</P>
<P>
Add Boone: The Philadelphia Phillies gave up on him in 1981 when he was 34. He 
will make more money this year with Kansas City, $1.9 million, than he made in 
all 10 years in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Nolan Ryan had the most strikeouts of any major league pitcher in 
the 1980s. Who was second? 
</P>
<P>
Now-it-can-be-told dept.: Jim Palmer and Joe Morgan, newest members of the 
baseball Hall of Fame, were adversaries in the 1977 All-Star game at Yankee 
Stadium. Morgan tagged Palmer for a leadoff home run. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer: "I went 3-and-2 on Morgan. I knew -- and this is what made him as great 
as he is -- if I walked him, and if he felt good, he'd steal second. If he 
really felt good, he'd steal third. A walk to Joe Morgan was a triple, so I 
took the stupid way out. I threw him a low fastball, and he hit it about 311 
feet." 
</P>
<P>
Deflation: Said Tom Lasorda as he signed baseballs at an autograph show: "This 
signature may not be worth much now, but five years from now it will be worth 
less." 
</P>
<P>
Roomies: From Burt Graeff of the Cleveland Plain Dealer: "Collectively, San 
Antonio rookies David Robinson and Sean Elliott will earn about $5 million this 
season. While most NBA players pay the added expense of having a single room on 
the road, Robinson and Elliott save about $38 a night by doubling up. 
</P>
<P>
Said Coach Larry Brown: "I think Sean does it because he likes David. David 
does it because he likes money." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis, beware: If Loyola Marymount's Hank Gathers fails to make it in the NBA, 
it won't be for lack of confidence. He told USA Today: "Whoever gets me will be 
very lucky. I'm a scorer -- not a shooter. I can put the ball on the floor. I'm 
a Dennis Rodman type, but I'd eat Dennis Rodman alive. I'm a hell of a player 
and I know it." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The Dodgers' Fernando Valenzuela. 
</P>

said, 'I do.' " HARLEY TINKHAM

CLIPPERS ARE GIVEN CAUSE TO CELEBRATE; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: CHARLES SMITH SCORES CAREER-HIGH 40 POINTS AS CLUB HOLDS ON TO 
WIN AT INDIANA, 107-105. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

INDIANAPOLIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Finally, Charles Smith will allow himself to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
In seven previous games, the Clipper forward averaged 28.3 points, including 
three performances of 30 or better. The Clippers won one, Tuesday night over 
Seattle at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, before 12,823 at Market Square Arena, Smith scored a 
career-high 40 points. And the Clippers beat the Indiana Pacers, 107-105, 
sweeping the two-game season series against a possible playoff team in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel really good now," Smith said. "Not only was I scoring, but, best of 
all, we won the game." 
</P>
<P>
The 40 points also represent the most by any Clipper this season, topping the 
39 by Danny Manning and Ron Harper, and Smith had 24 of those at halftime and 
36 by the end of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But while he may have been a small factor on the scoreboard in the final 12 
minutes, Smith's impact in other areas helped the Clippers improve to 23-34 and 
win for the second time in three games. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacers certainly felt it. 
</P>
<P>
On defense: With the score tied, 105-105, after Smith made a turn-around jumper 
from the right baseline, Manning and Smith double-teamed Detlef Schrempf in the 
low post. Manning swatted the potential game-winner away and Clipper Tom 
Garrick picked up the ball. 
</P>
<P>
On offense: After a Clipper timeout with 4.8 seconds left, Manning prepared for 
the entry pass from half court. Smith set a screen on Chuck Person at the 
free-throw line that allowed Garrick to break free. Garrick caught the ball 
from Manning under the basket and, all alone, layed it in with his left hand. 
</P>
<P>
"There was one guy on the ball and two guys on Charlie," said Garrick, who had 
12 points and five assists, with no turnovers. "Somebody had to be open." 
</P>
<P>
When Reggie Miller's desperation jumper at the buzzer for Indiana went wide, 
the Clippers had a victory in their first game since it was revealed players 
recently met with owner Donald T. Sterling and asked that Coach Don Casey be 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers blew an 11-point third-quarter lead and then came back for what is 
probably their biggest victory since they beat the Lakers Jan. 30. 
</P>
<P>
"I think catching this team (Indiana), great shooters that they are, and with 
these kids on the road is a tremendous lift," Casey said after the Clippers won 
here for only the second time in 11 seasons. "Despite the fact that there are 
other areas to draw their attention, they focused on what they should." 
</P>
<P>
Said Smith, who is shooting 58% (69 of 119) the last seven games after making 
13 of 20 against the Pacers: "It was real good. It makes us think if we would 
have played like this (Thursday) night, with a few breaks at Charlotte, we 
should be 2-0 on the trip. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, after an overtime loss to the Hornets, the league's losingest team, 
they are 1-1. One thing remains constant, however: changing lineups. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Manning was a starter again after coming off the bench the previous 
game and Benoit Benjamin spent a lot of time watching as Casey went with a 
smaller lineup to offset the Pacers' quickness. Benjamin played nine minutes in 
the first half and eight in the second. 
</P>
<P>
The matchups worked well, especially Rik Smits on Smith. The Clippers intended 
to attack Smits whether he guarded Manning or Smith, but he just happened to be 
on the Clippers' hottest offensive weapon. 
</P>
<P>
One who, at last, feels like celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Elgin Baylor reaffirmed previous comments by Sterling that 
Casey will not be fired before the end of the season, a request made by some 
players. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Casey and I told the players that there are still a lot of games left 
and that everyone should continue to give their best effort," Baylor said from 
Los Angeles. "Right now, no changes are anticipated this season and everyone 
will be reviewed afterward. Whatever is best for the team will happen." 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
The most points scored against the Pacers this season are the 40 by Charles 
Smith and the 39 by Ron Harper, the latter coming Dec. 19 at the Sports Arena 
in the teams' first game. . . . The Clippers have won eight road games, one 
more than the previous two seasons combined. . . . Of the team-high 28 points 
by Indiana's Reggie Miller, 23 came in the second half.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
NOTRE DAME GETS IRISH UP, TROUNCES NO. 3 MISSOURI, 98-67 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Missouri Coach Norm Stewart had trouble explaining the third-ranked Tigers' 
98-67 loss to unranked Notre Dame Saturday at South Bend, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
"We just weren't very good today, and I'd have a tough time explaining that, so 
I won't," Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Horton, one of the five Missouri reserves who started the second half, 
didn't have a problem explaining what happened. 
</P>
<P>
"Old fashioned butt-kicking, that's what it was," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Monty Williams led a balanced attack with 14 points as Notre Dame probably 
moved back into the NCAA tournament picture with its victory over the Big Eight 
Conference champions. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish, forcing numerous turnovers, took a 13-point halftime lead, holding 
Missouri to 40% shooting. They expanded the margin to 29 points with a 20-4 run 
that closed with a LaPhonso Ellis steal and basket and two free throws by Ellis 
after another Notre Dame steal. Much of it came against Missouri reserves who 
started the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish (15-11) went on to outscore the Tigers, 52-34, in the second half as 
they revived the NCAA tournament hopes that were damaged by three consecutive 
losses after a victory two weeks ago against then fourth-ranked Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri (26-4) had 12 second-half turnovers. The score was 46-33 at halftime 
and 73-51 midway through the second half, Notre Dame's lead peaking at 91-58. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OTHER TOP 25 TEAMS 
</P>
<P>
No. 1 Kansas 96, Iowa State 63 -- Kevin Pritchard led a 14-2 run at the end of 
the first half and the Jayhawks went on to rout the Cyclones in the Big Eight 
game at Lawrence, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
The Jayhawks (28-3, 11-3 in the Big Eight), who did not shoot a free throw in 
the first half while Iowa State shot 14, tied Oklahoma for second place. The 28 
victories are the second-most in school history. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa State (10-17, 4-10) has lost 17 of its last 18 games in Lawrence. The 
teams will play again Friday in the first round of the Big Eight Tournament at 
Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
No. 4 Connecticut 95, Boston College 74 -- The Huskies clinched a tie for the 
Big East title at Newton, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Connecticut (25-5, 12-4) will share the conference's regular-season title with 
the winner of seventh-ranked Georgetown's game today at 10th-ranked Syracuse. 
Boston College finished its regular season at 8-19. Its 1-15 conference record 
is the worst in its history. 
</P>
<P>
Five Huskies scored in double figures, led by Nadav Henefield with 18 points. 
The Huskies, who entered the game with a 63.6 free throw percentage, made 38 of 
44. 
</P>
<P>
No. 5 Oklahoma 107, Oklahoma State 94 -- William Davis scored 10 points during 
a 27-2 second-half run and Smokey McCovery scored nine points in a row in the 
closing minutes at Stillwater, Okla., as the Sooners made a bid for the No. 1 
ranking. 
</P>
<P>
The victory in the regular season finale capped a week during which the Sooners 
(23-4, 12-3) also beat Missouri and Kansas when each was ranked No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who scored 27 points, led the way as Oklahoma seized control with the 
27-2 run during an eight-minute span. That spurt, during which Oklahoma State 
(15-12, 6-8) scored on only one of 14 possessions, gave the Sooners a 78-52 
lead with 11:16 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
No. 11 Georgia Tech 85, No. 20 Clemson 69 -- Brian Oliver scored 34 points, 
Dennis Scott had 25 and Kenny Anderson added 21 to help the Yellow Jackets end 
the Tigers' eight-game winning streak in the Atlantic Coast Conference game at 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
The loss by Clemson left the door open for Duke to climb into a first-place tie 
with the Tigers in the final ACC regular-season standings if the Blue Devils 
beat North Carolina today. 
</P>
<P>
Tech (21-6, 8-6) never trailed after Oliver converted a three-point play with 
13:53 left in the first half, overcoming a 17-15 deficit. Tech built a 51-34 
lead shortly after halftime, but Clemson (23-6, 10-4) used an 18-2 run to pull 
to 53-52 with 11:44 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
No. 12 Arkansas 104, Rice 80 -- Todd Day scored 24 points at Houston to lead 
the Razorbacks to their second consecutive Southwest Conference regular-season 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
The Razorbacks (23-4, 14-2) dominated the Owls (11-16, 5-11), leading 49-32 at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
No. 13 La Salle 90, Fairfield 60 -- Lionel Simmons scored 34 points and had 11 
rebounds to lead the Explorers to their 19th consecutive victory in a 
quarterfinal game of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference tournament at 
Albany, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
After taking a 33-21 halftime lead, La Salle (27-1) scored eight of the first 
10 points in the second half. Jack Hurd's layup was followed by a Doug Overton 
steal and dunk and put the Explorers ahead, 41-23, with 17:13 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Fairfield (10-19) never got closer than 10 in the second half. 
</P>

No. 14 Michigan State 75, No. 17 Minnesota 73 -- Steve Smith's jumper with 29 
seconds left in overtime at Minneapolis capped a 39-point performance and gave 
the Spartans a one-game lead in the Big Ten with their 10th consecutive 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans (24-5, 13-3) have games remaining at Northwestern and against 
Purdue, which takes a 12-4 conference record into today's game against 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State's winning streak is its longest since 1978-79, when Magic 
Johnson led the Spartans to the national championship and their last Big Ten 
title. 
</P>
<P>
In losing for only the third time in its last 30 games at Williams Arena, 
Minnesota (20-7, 11-6) was eliminated from the Big Ten race. 
</P>
<P>
No. 15 Louisiana State 103, Mississippi 94 -- Chris Jackson scored 37 points 
and Shaquille O'Neal had 20 points, 14 rebounds and five blocked shots to lead 
the Tigers to the Southeastern Conference victory at Baton Rouge, La. 
</P>
<P>
LSU (21-5, 11-4) held an 82-60 lead with 10:20 to play, but Mississippi (11-16, 
8-10) pulled to 98-88 in the next 8:34 during a 28-16 run led by Gerald Glass 
and Tim Jumper. 
</P>
<P>
Dayton 111, No. 19 Xavier (Ohio) 108 -- Negele Knight scored 30 points and Ray 
Springer had 26 as the Flyers, who led by as many as 26 points in the second 
half, upset the Musketeers in their final Midwestern Collegiate Conference game 
at Dayton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
The Musketeers (24-3, 12-2) outscored the Flyers, 42-19, in the last 8:45. 
</P>
<P>
Noland Robinson made a layup to give the Flyers (18-9, 10-4) a 110-102 lead 
with 1:03 to play, then Alex Robertson made one of two free throws with 55 
seconds left to make the score 111-102. 
</P>
<P>
No. 25 Georgia 94, Auburn 79 -- The Bulldogs clinched their first outright 
Southeastern Conference championship as Litterial Green scored 30 points, 
including 11 during a 16-0 run that carried the Bulldogs past the Tigers at 
Auburn, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia (20-7, 13-5) had already clinched at least a share of the title, but 
the victory prevented Alabama and LSU from creating a three-way tie. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs dominated Auburn (12-17, 8-10) down the stretch, outscoring the 
Tigers, 27-10, after they closed to six with 9 1/2 minutes left.

</P>
<P>
After the Sun Devils' Mark Becker failed to inbound the ball in the required 
five seconds, Oregon called a timeout. Keith Reynolds inbounded the ball to 
Brandon, who drove through the lane but missed a short shot. Richard Lucas 
tried to tip the ball in, but missed. Austin rebounded and was fouled with two 
seconds to play.

WAVES HOLD OFF ST. MARY'S, 94-83 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY RIPTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before the West Coast Conference tournament began, Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury 
said he hoped his team wouldn't be caught looking past anybody. 
</P>
<P>
The second-seeded Waves were almost caught gazing ahead by seventh-seeded St. 
Mary's Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Gaels got Pepperdine's attention with torrid first-half shooting and by 
making 11 of 33 three-point baskets. St. Mary's tied school and conference 
tournament records for three-point baskets and broke WCC and school records for 
attempts. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves weathered the storm of three-pointers and held off St. Mary's, 94-83, 
in the first round of the conference tournament at Loyola Marymount. They will 
play San Diego -- an 80-74 winner over San Francisco Saturday -- tonight at 7 
in the tournament semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
The Gaels (7-20) surprised Pepperdine by making eight of their first nine 
shots, senior forward James Dailey -- who wasn't supposed to play -- making 
three of them. 
</P>
<P>
Dailey had missed all but one of his team's last seven games -- and had made 
only a brief appearance in that -- because of a back injury. He started, played 
31 minutes and scored 23 points on eight-of-15 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Dailey's three early baskets sparked his team to a 22-12 lead in the first 6 
1/2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine (17-11) took its first lead when Rex Manu made two free throws for a 
31-30 edge with 6:01 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
After that, Pepperdine went on a 19-4 run and led at halftime, 50-34. 
</P>
<P>
St. Mary's, which made only three of 12 three-point attempts in the first half, 
made eight of 21 in the second. Gael guard Mike Vontoure made three of his five 
three-pointers in the second half, and St. Mary's twice pulled to within seven 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Vontoure, who finished with a game-high 26 points, cut Pepperdine's advantage 
to 79-73 with five minutes to play. But the Gaels began to tire, and Pepperdine 
began to pull away. 
</P>
<P>
St. Mary's Coach Paul Landreaux said he thought his team had "a chance to win 
the game down the stretch, but we missed some big three-point shots that would 
have kept us in (it)." 
</P>
<P>
Asbury said his team had played well at times, "but I think we got a little 
comfortable in the second half and started coasting." 
</P>
<P>
Dexter Howard led Pepperdine with 24 points and 16 rebounds and Tom Lewis added 
21 points.

TREVINO LOVES THAT BACK NINE AT VINTAGE; 
</P>
<P>
SENIOR GOLF: AFTER SHOOTING A 31 FRIDAY, HE HAS A 32 SATURDAY TO TAKE 
THREE-SHOT LEAD GOING INTO TOURNAMENT'S FINAL ROUND.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Senior PGA Tour has moved some 3,000 miles west, bringing two trends along: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lee Trevino is still making a shambles of the competition; and interest in 
the 50-and-older set is soaring. 
</P>
<P>
Trevino, a winner twice and runner-up in a third senior tournament in Florida, 
shot his 11th consecutive sub-par round, a five-under 67 Saturday at Vintage 
Country Club to take a three-stroke lead after 36 holes of the 54-hole Chrysler 
Vintage Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
Trevino has a 133 total, 11 under par, and leads Don Massengale by three shots. 
Trevino is five shots ahead of Ben Smith and Jim Dent, who are at 138. Another 
group of five, including Gary Player and John Brodie, are at 139. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-three of the 54 pros are under par. 
</P>
<P>
Through six holes of the second round, the field was close. Trevino wasn't even 
the leader. 
</P>
<P>
He was tied for the lead approaching the 10th tee. 
</P>
<P>
Three holes later, he was back in charge. On the 10th hole, he sank an 
18-footer from the fringe for a birdie. On 11, he holed a chip from high grass 
behind the green; and, on 12, he made an eight-footer to go 10 under. 
</P>
<P>
Friday on the back nine, he birdied five of the last six holes and shot a 31. 
Despite a bogey on the 17th hole, he had a 32 Saturday. Trevino said a 12-foot 
putt on 17 for a bogey saved the day. 
</P>
<P>
"On the short par three, I hit a 'hard nine' into the bunker," he said. "I had 
a downhill lie, tried to hit it easy and left it in the bunker. The next one 
went 12 feet past the cup. That's when I had a talk with myself. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Don't miss this one. You can't let these guys get back in the 
tournament.' I really went after that one." 
</P>
<P>
On the 503-yard 18th, a par five, Trevino's drive rolled past the 280-yard 
marker. He then hit a five-wood to within 12 feet of the hole. His bid for an 
eagle lipped out. 
</P>
<P>
Massengale probably echoed the feelings of most of Trevino's pursuers when he 
said: "I'd feel pretty good if it wasn't Trevino ahead of me. I'm playing quite 
well. He's just uncanny. He's playing great." 
</P>
<P>
Trevino said he is not playing perfect golf or even thinking right all the 
time. After sinking a three-foot birdie on the second hole, he bogeyed four and 
five to fall behind. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't playing smart on either of those two holes. On four (a 404-yard par 
4) I used the wrong club and hit the ball over the green. I chipped 15 feet 
past the hole and charged the putt. 
</P>
<P>
"I went right at the flag on the next hole -- a par three -- with a six-iron. I 
went to the right but had a two-foot putt for the par. It was the worst putt 
I've made in months. I didn't even get close. I don't think I ever four-putted, 
but I almost did." 
</P>
<P>
He birdied the 521-yard, par-five sixth hole and, at that time, Brodie, 
Massengale, Dent, Rives McBee and Mike Hill were all tied with Trevino at six 
under. 
</P>
<P>
Trevino was just waiting for the back nine to light up the board. 
</P>
<P>
Although no crowd count was given, the increase in attendance in recent years 
has been dramatic. There were several thousand spectators following Trevino, 
whose gallery appeared to be larger than the total for the four-day event in 
other years. 
</P>
<P>
"We first saw the big increase in Florida," said Bruce Crampton, who is five 
shots under par but probably out of contention. "I know the presence of Trevino 
has something to do with it, but I also believe golf fans have decided we are 
worth watching. It is really exciting to see the big crowds." 
</P>
<P>
This is the 10th year of the Vintage, which began as a TV event when the Senior 
Tour was in its infancy. Only a few people were allowed to watch live. Through 
the years, it has seemed to discourage attendance. Now, it can't stop the flow. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Miller Barber was elated after shooting a 67 for a 140. Last 
year Barber started out with a victory, a second, an eighth and a third before 
winning here. But, in June, a freak accident almost ended his season. 
</P>
<P>
"I finally feel right," Barber, 58, said. "I have started my comeback."

OLAJUWON GETS QUADRUPLE-DOUBLE IN WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Akeem Olajuwon, who had the third quadruple-double in NBA history with 29 
points, 18 rebounds, 11 blocked shots and 10 assists, might have gotten an 
assist from the official scorer Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Olajuwon, who has been criticized for not passing enough, never before had more 
than seven assists in an NBA game. He picked a perfect time to reach double 
figures in assists. 
</P>
<P>
"I might do it more often," Olajuwon said after leading the Houston Rockets to 
a 129-109 victory over the Golden State Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
The achievement of reaching double figures in four statistical categories was 
somewhat tainted, however, when the original boxscore showed Olajuwon with nine 
assists. The number was changed to 10. 
</P>
<P>
Nate Thurmond of Chicago was the first to accomplish a quadruple-double with 22 
points, 14 rebounds, 13 assists and 12 blocked shots on Oct. 18, 1974. Alvin 
Robertson, then of San Antonio, had 20 points, 10 assists, 11 rebounds and 10 
steals on Feb. 18, 1986 against Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
"Olajuwon had a very special game. It seemed like every time we had someone 
going to the basket on a drive, he was there to block the shot," Warrior Coach 
Don Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State, which has lost eight of its last nine games, was led by Chris 
Mullin's 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
Houston used a 25-6 run to take a 48-38 lead with 4:25 remaining in the first 
half. The Rockets outscored the Warriors, 34-13, in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"The second quarter was the story of the game," Nelson said. "It was 
devastating. Some games are decided in the last two minutes. This one was 
decided in the second quarter." 
</P>
<P>
Olajuwon had eight points during that stretch as the Rockets extended their 
lead to 60-45 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
New York 106, Milwaukee 105 -- Patrick Ewing scored 31 points and Charles 
Oakley had 11 of his 23 in the fourth quarter for the Knicks in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Maurice Cheeks scored on a pass from Ewing to give the Knicks the lead for good 
at 102-101 with 39.3 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
After the Bucks called a timeout, Oakley grabbed a rebound and was fouled by 
Ricky Pierce. Oakley converted both free throws and Trent Tucker and Ewing 
added one each, the last making it 106-102 after a free throw by Milwaukee's 
Mike Dunleavy. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Humphries finished the scoring with a three-point basket for Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 114, Atlanta 109 -- Sam Bowie had 25 points and 12 rebounds and 
Purvis Short scored 12 of his 20 points in the fourth quarter as the Nets ended 
a four-game losing streak and halted Atlanta's five-game winning streak at East 
Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Short broke a 104-104 tie and gave the Nets the lead for good when he made two 
free throws with 1:41 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta's Dominique Wilkins led all scorers with 36 points and has 80 in two 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento 104, Charlotte 103 -- Antoine Carr's two free throws with 23.5 
seconds left capped a 6-0 run that gave the Kings a victory in Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
The Hornets led, 103-98, with 1:25 to play when Randolph Keys made one of two 
free throws. But Sacramento's Wayman Tisdale made two turnaround jump shots to 
pull the Kings within one before Carr converted the decisive free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 132, Orlando 128 -- Bernard King had 34 points and Washington scored 
five points in the final 14 seconds of regulation, then went on to win in 
Orlando in double overtime. 
</P>
<P>
King and Ledell Eackles made critical three-point shots in the final 51 seconds 
of regulation to help the Bullets overcome a six-point deficit in the final 55 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 112, San Antonio 98 -- Karl Malone scored 36 points and John Stockton had 
22 points and 20 assists to lead the Jazz in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second consecutive game that Stockton had 20 or more assists and the 
18th 20-plus game of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Denver 106, Dallas 89 -- Michael Adams scored 13 points in a six-minute span of 
the first half, lifting the Nuggets in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Adams finished with 15 points. Alex English scored 24 points for Denver. Sam 
Perkins scored 16 to lead Dallas, which played without 7-footers James 
Donaldson and Roy Tarpley because of injury and illness. 
</P>
<P>
Portland 110, Seattle 98 -- Clyde Drexler scored 20 points to lead six Trail 
Blazers in double figures at Portland. 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers took the lead for good late in the first quarter, but Seattle 
stayed close until Portland scored 11 consecutive points for an 84-67 lead with 
10:52 left in the game. Seattle got no closer than eight after that.

Santa Maria St. Joseph won its first Southern Section 2-A boys' basketball 
championship Saturday at the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach's free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Cavazos scored 20 of his game-high 32 points in the second half as the 
Knights rallied from a 14-point deficit to beat Laguna Beach, 70-68, at the 
Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights opened the fourth quarter with a 15-2 run and Spencer MacCuish made 
the front end of a one-and-one free throw opportunity with five seconds left to 
seal the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach missed five free throws late in the game, including the front end 
of three one-and-ones in the final 1 minute 29 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought in the last two minutes the game was ours," Laguna Beach Coach Ed 
Bowen said. "All we had to do was win it at the free-throw line." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, St. Joseph, which lost four of its first six games, improved to 20-7. 
Laguna Beach is now 22-6. 
</P>
<P>
St. Joseph led, 69-67, after a free throw by Cavazo with 1:28 left. 
</P>
<P>
Borella, who scored 18 of his team-high 25 points in the first half, missed the 
front end of a one-and-one opportunity with 1:17 left to begin the Artists' 
struggle from the line. 
</P>
<P>
The Artists had made nine of 12 free throws before the fourth quarter, but made 
only seven of 14 in the final quarter.

<P>
Brett Hull and Jeff Brown scored two goals each as the St. Louis Blues beat the 
New York Islanders, 5-4, Saturday night at St. Louis to take over first place 
in the Norris Division. 
</P>
<P>
Hull, the NHL's top goal-scorer with 64, also had two assists in becoming only 
the third player in Blues' history to score more than 100 points. He has 102. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, 100 is great," Hull said. "But first place is the best thing. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't consider myself a superstar. Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemeiux are the 
superstars. I just look good because of the help I get." 
</P>
<P>
The victory moved the Blues (34-25-8) two points in front of the Chicago 
Blackhawks. 
</P>
<P>
New York is winless in its last nine games (0-7-2). 
</P>
<P>
The Blues built a 5-2 lead on Hull's goals early in the final period, but the 
Islanders made it close on goals by David Volek and Paul Gagne but couldn't get 
the tying goal in the last 2:47. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary 5, Vancouver 1 -- Doug Gilmour had a goal and three assists as the 
Flames defeated the Canucks at Calgary and clinched a playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave the defending Stanley Cup champions 77 points in the Smythe 
Division, 26 ahead of last-place Vancouver, which has 12 games left. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary also maintained its one-point lead over second-place Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Mullen, Al MacInnis, Brian MacLellan and Jamie Macoun also scored for the 
Flames. Paul Reinhart, a former Flame, scored for Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton 5, Philadelphia 3 -- Mark Messier scored four goals for the third time 
in his 11-year career as the Oilers beat the Flyers at Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers also clinched a playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
Messier has 39 goals and 74 assists for 113 points, two better than his 
previous best in 1987-88. 
</P>
<P>
The game also marked the triumphant return to the Oiler net of goaltender Grant 
Fuhr, who stopped 35 shots. It was his first appearance since Dec. 16, when he 
suffered a shoulder injury. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 4, Chicago 3 -- Cam Neely's second goal of the game and 47th of the 
season with 3:21 left gave the Bruins a come-from-behind victory over the 
Blackhawks at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Propp and Dave Poulin, two recent acquisitions from the Philadelphia 
Flyers, had a goal and an assist apiece in the Bruins' league-leading 40th 
victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Neely tipped in Ray Bourque's shot from the point on a power play only 2:35 
after Poulin tied it, 3-3, with a 25-foot blast past goalie Alain Chevrier. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 6, N.Y. Rangers 4 -- Ron Francis scored his 26th and 27th goals and 
assisted on Pat Verbeek's game-winner early in the third period as the Whalers 
ended the Rangers' seven-game unbeaten streak at Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Verbeek added a pair of assists for the Whalers, who have won three consecutive 
games and are 5-2 since Feb. 18. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Kisio had a goal and two assists for the Rangers, and Darren Turcotte had 
his 28th goal, tops among NHL rookies. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 3, Montreal 2 -- Brian Bellows equaled a career high with his 41st 
goal and Jon Casey made 33 saves at Bloomington, Minn., and the North Stars 
handed the Canadiens their third consecutive defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Bellows, an eight-year veteran, tied the mark he set in the 1983-84 season, his 
second in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadiens, already short-handed due to injuries to Bobby Smith and Chris 
Chelios, played without defenseman Craig Ludwig and center Guy Carbonneau, who 
were scratched by Coach Pat Burns after they missed curfew Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Quebec 3, Buffalo 3 -- Peter Stastny scored on a power play at 10:32 of the 
third period to give the visiting Nordiques a tie with the Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Gillis scored less than a minute earlier as the Nordiques came back from a 
two-goal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Pierre Turgeon, Dave Andreychuk and Dave Snuggerud scored to give Buffalo a 3-1 
lead. Ken McRae scored 43 seconds into the game for the Nordiques.

Shot Gun Scott, a 25-1 shot, won Saturday's Fountain of Youth Stakes at 
Gulfstream Park in a four-horse finish that further clouded the Triple Crown 
picture on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Smelly, which went off at 21-1, finished second by a nose. 
</P>
<P>
Unbridled, who closed the strongest after lacking running room through the 
stretch, edged Sunny Serve for third in the 13-horse field of 3-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
The best finish among the supposed Triple Crown contenders was by Slavic, who 
went off as the favorite and took sixth place. Second choice Rhythm had perfect 
position going to the far turn and faded to 10th. Yonder, trained by Woody 
Stephens, was never in the hunt and finished 12th. 
</P>
<P>
Shot Gun Scott, ridden by Dave Penna, ran the 1 1/16 miles in 1:44 3/5 and won 
by half a length. The $129,045 Fountain of Youth is the major prep for the 
$500,000 Florida Derby March 17 and a steppingstone toward the Kentucky Derby 
May 5. 
</P>
<P>
Shot Gun Scott paid $52.60, $21 and $9.60. Smelly paid $22.40 and $13.20. 
Unbridled, an entry with Top Snob, paid $6.40 to show.

GANG KILLING FIELDS GROWING EVER WIDER; 
</P>
<P>
SHOOTINGS: DRIVE-BY ATTACKS REACHED RECORD PROPORTIONS IN CITIES WHERE THEY 
WERE RARE 10 YEARS AGO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The tiny yellow house near the Pomona railroad tracks was to be Marie 
Rodriguez's refuge from gang life. 
</P>
<P>
The month before, she and her two young children had gone to stay there with a 
friend, leaving behind her husband and, she hoped, the violent rivalries that 
have plagued the city for generations. 
</P>
<P>
But on the morning of Feb. 13, as the 23-year-old snack bar employee was 
helping clean house, she discovered what it is to flee a war in which anyone 
can be considered fair game. 
</P>
<P>
In a scene played out nearly every day somewhere in the San Gabriel Valley, a 
car passed slowly by, a gang name was shouted out and several rounds from a 
shotgun were pumped into the bungalow. The apparent target: a rival gang member 
who had come over to offer use of his vacuum cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the lead pellets tore into the head of Rodriguez's son, Daniel, a 
Little Leaguer who had celebrated his seventh birthday just a few weeks before. 
Also hit was Olga Perez, 23, the friend who had given them a place to stay. She 
survived, but after four days in intensive care, Daniel was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
"I left . . . to get away from this," Rodriguez said as she waited that first 
night in the hospital. "I just want it to stop." 
</P>
<P>
From Pasadena to Pomona, Altadena to Claremont, the drive-by shooting has 
exploded across the suburban tracts east of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In cities where gang attacks were rare 10 years ago, the drive-by reached 
record proportions in 1989. Pasadena, for instance, was so hard hit that 
officers for the first time began keeping a day-to-day tally of the shootings, 
the only San Gabriel Valley police department to do so. 
</P>
<P>
By year's end, the number had reached a staggering 108 -- at least a 50% rise 
over the previous 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
In many other communities, where long-standing gang rivalries had fizzled over 
the last decade, the drive-by returned with a vengeance. Baldwin Park logged 68 
such shootings last year, the Industry area, including La Puente and Valinda, 
had more than 50 and tiny San Gabriel finished with 11. 
</P>
<P>
To a large extent, those figures reflect a rise in gang activity throughout Los 
Angeles County, where gang-related homicides have gone up 23%, from 452 murders 
in 1988 to 554 in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But numbers alone don't tell the story of what happens when bullets fly 
indiscriminately, turning innocent bystanders, both young and old, into victims 
of geography. 
</P>
<P>
Although drive-by shootings are usually intended as retaliation against rival 
gang members -- not as random violence -- someone other than a rival gang 
member gets hit 20% to 50% of the time, according to various law-enforcement 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, they're not very discriminating as to who they shoot," said 
Pasadena Police Sgt. Monte Yancey. "And they don't seem to have much of a 
conscience." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of drive-by shootings in 1989, a middle-aged Monterey Park woman 
was hit in the face by stray shotgun pellets while waiting for a bus, a 
35-year-old Pasadena man was wounded as he stood in line next to two gang 
members at a hamburger stand and three young Pomona men, ages 20, 18 and 17, 
were killed on a street corner, allegedly by gang members upset that they 
wouldn't join the gang. 
</P>
<P>
A 12-year-old Rosemead boy was shot in the leg and thigh as he chatted with a 
friend in his driveway. Two high school football players from Baldwin Park were 
wounded, allegedly by gang members who mistook their car for that of a rival. 
And 21-year-old Michael Carrillo, a former San Gabriel resident who moved to 
Missouri, was killed by shotgun blasts to the face and chest last September 
during a visit back to the community, where his parents still live. 
</P>
<P>
Carrillo was not a gang member, police say, but had been outside talking with 
old friends on a street that another gang considered rival turf. 
</P>
<P>
"Just another case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time," said San 
Gabriel Police Detective Kenneth Butler. "He wasn't even dressed like a 
gangbanger. He was wearing these little shorts and could have easily fit in 
with a bunch of kids at a party on Huntington Beach." 
</P>
<P>
Things were not like this before. Those who work closely with gang members say 
there has been an erosion of respect in recent years, a willingness to commit 
violent acts that even hardened gangbangers had previously considered 
unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons, say counselors and probation officers, include a new generation of 
smaller cliques that don't play by the rules of older gangs, and the emergence 
of immigrant gangs from Mexico and Central America without ties to the 
traditions of longtime Chicano gangs. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, they point to the lawlessness engendered by the growth of the 
rock-cocaine trade and a general sense among many of these youths that the line 
between right and wrong has been blurred by politics and warfare around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
"They see viciousness, duplicity and stealing all around them," said Mike 
Duran, director of specialized youth services for the Los Angeles County 
Probation Department. "You tell me where people are honest with each other. The 
kids pick up on all these negatives and closely emulate them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost to the point of having to go back and retrain these guys," Duran 
added. "Tell them, 'Go ahead, be a gang member, but, goddamnit, have some 
respect for yourself and people around you.' " 
</P>
<P>
In Pomona, many look back to an April 3, 1987, shooting at Holy Cross Cemetery 
as the point at which things took a turn for the worse. 
</P>
<P>
Four people, including two young girls, were wounded when rival gang members 
opened fire on a crowd of several hundred mourners who had come to bury a young 
man gunned down in a drive-by shooting the week before. 
</P>
<P>
Two months later, four more people were wounded when a gunman fired into a 
crowd of youths who had gathered in a park to view a movie promoting 
alternatives to gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
As disturbing as those incidents were, 1989 ended up as Pomona's most violent 
year ever, with 44 murders. Nineteen of the victims were killed in drive-bys, 
which numbered more than 100. 
</P>
<P>
"If they kill a baby, they don't care," said Lt. Chuck Brantley, who works in 
the sheriff's anti-gang program, Operation Safe Streets. "They feel no remorse. 
They're doing what they were brought up to believe is right. In their own 
minds, they're soldiers." 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, say the emotions are more complex. The fatal shooting last 
month of 7-year-old Daniel Rodriguez, for instance, troubled many people in the 
Cherrieville community, home to the gang member suspected of committing the 
murder, said Rudy Gutierrez, who grew up in the neighborhood and now works with 
high-risk youths at Fremont Junior High School in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody liked that Daniel got hit," Gutierrez said. "Some might not say 
anything, because they've been conditioned to think, 'Well, he just got in the 
way.' But they're still human. They still hurt." 
</P>
<P>
He applauded the mother whose 16-year-old boy is suspected of the shooting for 
turning her son in to police the next day. "I thought that was pretty noble, 
myself," Gutierrez said. And he praised the boy, whose name was not released 
because of his age, for accepting her rule. 
</P>
<P>
But police rarely get that kind of cooperation. Drive-by shootings are among 
the most difficult crimes to solve, especially if they occur at night and are 
directed at an unoccupied house or car, officers say. 
</P>
<P>
Even if there are witnesses, many are afraid to testify for fear of 
retaliation. And if gang members are wounded, even critically, they frequently 
refuse to provide police with any information about their assailants. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been times when a guy's been shot and he's in the hospital and we've 
explained to him, 'You may die,' " said Baldwin Park Police Lt. Michael 
Bennett. "And they always say, 'I'll take care of it myself, or if I don't 
live, my home boys will take care of it.' It's a culture shock." 
</P>
<P>
It is a culture, though, that has left many San Gabriel Valley communities 
untouched. More than half a dozen cities in the region had no drive-by 
shootings last year, including San Marino, South Pasadena, Arcadia, Irwindale 
and La Verne. 
</P>
<P>
"Not even an accidental discharge," said Sierra Madre Police Sgt. Larry Lutzow. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, a few towns not known for major gang problems did suffer from 
drive-bys, including Monrovia with a dozen, Claremont with five and Glendora 
with one. 
</P>
<P>
But, for the most part, the shootings were limited to low-income neighborhoods 
with large minority populations, where economic opportunities are scarce and 
the social fabric torn. 
</P>
<P>
They are the kinds of neighborhoods where most gang members reside and the 
kinds of neighborhoods where most victims, whether from rival gangs or not, 
also live and die. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens is these gangs stereotype their victims," said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Dennis E. Ferris, who handles hard-core gang cases at the Pomona courthouse. 
"To them, any young black or Hispanic male in a rival neighborhood is fair 
game. You might say these guys are as much racists as anyone else." 
</P>

QUAKE PERIL SEEN AT BUSY FREEWAY INTERCHANGE; 
</P>
<P>
SAFETY: THE JUNCTION OF THE SANTA MONICA AND SAN DIEGO FREEWAYS IS 25 YEARS 
OLD, AMONG THE BUSIEST IN THE NATION, AND SITS NEXT TO THE NEWPORT-INGLEWOOD 
FAULT. 
</P>

<P>
The Upland earthquake, the strongest in Southern California in more than two 
years, has focused new attention on the potential danger that a major quake 
poses to the massive interchange of the Santa Monica and San Diego freeways. 
</P>
<P>
One of the busiest highway connections in the nation, it ranks at the top of 
the state's list of Los Angeles-area freeway segments considered most 
vulnerable to damage in a serious earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the five overpasses where Interstates 405 and 10 come together have 
been assigned Caltrans' highest rating of seismic risk, a rating based on the 
volume of traffic, the age of the structures and their proximity to the 
Newport-Inglewood Fault. The fault, which runs less than two miles east of the 
interchange, is considered the most dangerous in the urbanized portion of 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 526,000 vehicles a day used the junction in 1988, Caltrans 
spokeswoman Lisa Covington said. 
</P>
<P>
A $4.8-million program to tie freeway bridge decks together with steel cables 
is scheduled to begin this summer, but the effort is only the first phase in 
strengthening the 25-year-old interchange. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned about the potential risk to motorists, Assemblyman Tom Hayden 
(D-Santa Monica) is introducing legislation that would direct Caltrans to 
establish a priority system for retrofit projects based on risk rating, 
potential danger to the public and probability of an earthquake nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Hayden aides said the measure is intended to ensure that the San Diego-Santa 
Monica interchange is one of the first to be upgraded with state-of-the-art 
seismic safety engineering. 
</P>
<P>
After the devastating San Francisco Bay Area quake last October, Hayden called 
on Caltrans Director Robert K. Best to make improvements to the interchange -- 
the linchpin of the Westside's entire transportation network -- a top priority. 
</P>
<P>
"Over half a million cars pass through that interchange each day," Hayden said 
in a letter to Best. "Any structural weaknesses in this interchange presents an 
enormous risk to human life. For this reason alone, it is imperative that the 
steps required for seismic safety be taken as quickly as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans spokesman Jim Drago said the concrete and steel columns that support 
nearly 400 freeway bridges statewide have been identified as needing 
reinforcement, including many along the San Diego and Santa Monica freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges were assigned a risk rating based on a scale from 0.00 to 1.00, with 
the highest rating representing the most vulnerable structure. Three of the 
freeway connectors at the Santa Monica-San Diego Freeway junction were assigned 
1.0 ratings -- higher than any other interchange in Los Angeles County. Two 
other connectors in the same interchange were rated 0.92 and 0.95. 
</P>
<P>
California freeways underwent a fundamental redesign after the 6.4 magnitude 
Sylmar earthquake in 1971 caused extensive damage to overpasses in the northern 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Single-column structures built in the 1950s and 1960s, before the Sylmar quake, 
are considered most at risk. The San Diego-Santa Monica Freeway interchange was 
completed in August, 1964, at a cost of $25 million, and it predated those 
design changes. 
</P>
<P>
Court Burrell, Caltrans deputy district director, said Thursday that a "rather 
substantial project" to tie the freeway bridge decks together at the 
interchange will go out to bid in May. Work is expected to begin during the 
summer and last for six months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Burrell said the Phase I retrofitting "reduces the risk there tremendously," 
but, he said, "there will still be some risk left." 
</P>
<P>
Phase II of the retrofitting program will involve improvements to single-column 
structures that support the roadway. The concrete columns will be wrapped in a 
steel jacket to enhance their ability to resist a major quake. 
</P>
<P>
Drago said the second phase of the retrofitting program will cost at least $100 
million. Financed out of highway funds and proceeds from an emergency increase 
in the state sales tax, the program will take until the end of 1991 to 
complete, he said. 
</P>
<P>
After the 5.9-magnitude Whittier earthquake in October, 1987, Caltrans 
engineers predicted that a major quake along the Newport-Inglewood Fault would 
subject at least a dozen major freeways or interchanges in Los Angeles to 
strong shaking. They predicted that as many as 100 fatalities could be 
attributed to bridge collapses along the San Diego, Long Beach and San Gabriel 
River freeways. 
</P>
<P>
After the San Francisco earthquake collapsed a double-deck section of the 
Nimitz Freeway, killing 42 people, engineers retracted the predictions, saying 
they had no "specific knowledge" that 100 deaths could occur. 
</P>
<P>
James H. Gates, a structural mechanics engineer for Caltrans, said last fall 
that the Newport-Inglewood Fault, which runs nearly parallel to the San Diego 
Freeway, poses a major risk. The 1933 temblor estimated at 6.3 magnitude that 
devastated much of Long Beach was along that fault. (Wednesday's Upland quake, 
by comparison, measured 5.5.) 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody talks about the San Andreas, but we think the Newport-Inglewood is 
the critical one," Gates said. "If you get a 7 on the Newport-Inglewood, you're 
going to kill three times as many people as you would on the San Andreas."

HOUSING: A 71-YEAR-OLD APARTMENT TENANT IS LEADING A BATTLE AGAINST A PLANNED 
CONVERSION TO CONDOMINIUMS. BUT NOT EVERYONE APPROVES OF HER MISSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A day shy of her 72nd birthday, with a thick shock of white hair framing a set 
of bright blue eyes, Molly Adams claims she is anything but a rabble-rouser. 
</P>
<P>
But as the self-appointed watchdog for the elderly tenants in her Hancock Park 
apartment complex, she certainly seems to be doing a good job of it -- to the 
delight of some tenants, and the dismay of others. 
</P>
<P>
Adams, whose serene and matronly manner belies a steely determination and 
feistiness, has thrown herself headlong against the approval of a 
multimillion-dollar condominium conversion project under way at her building. 
In the process, she has fanned the flames of what has become a raging 
controversy, with potentially citywide repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy centers on Country Club Manor at 316 N. Rossmore Ave., where 
the owner, Haseko-Tekno Development Partners of Japan and Beverly Hills, plans 
to spend $2.5 million to turn the aging building into a luxury condominium 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
To some in the building, Adams is a heroine who has saved other tenants too old 
or infirm to fight for themselves from being displaced into unfamiliar 
surroundings at a time when the city already is reeling from an affordable 
rental-housing crisis. Adams and some of her allies maintain that management 
has intentionally driven out more than a dozen tenants in the last year -- many 
of them elderly widows -- to make room for pro-condo tenants, paving the way 
for windfall profits at the expense of some of society's most helpless. 
</P>
<P>
But the majority of residents, more than the 51% needed for city approval, say 
they favor the conversion. Many say they resent efforts by Adams and others to 
thwart approval by the city. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a troublemaker," said tenant Paul Ring, who favors condo conversion. 
Another tenant -- clinical psychologist Mimi Greenberg -- in a letter to City 
Council President John Ferraro, says she favors conversion and offers her 
"professional opinion" in assessing Adams' motives: "Fighting against the 
inevitable conversion of this building provides her with lots of busy work, 
intrigue and attention. She is an unhappy and sadly misguided old lady who 
apparently finds delight in malicious activities." 
</P>
<P>
Adams, a widow, has lived in the towering French Norman-style structure for 
more than 20 years and doesn't like what the new owners are doing to it and its 
tenants. 
</P>
<P>
"As God is my witness, I am anything but a hell-raiser," Adams said last week. 
"But the little people have got to be heard, otherwise we fall through the 
cracks of justice. God has given me good health, and I am not about to run up 
the white flag." 
</P>
<P>
City officials said late last week that they are listening. In fact, they say, 
Adams has presented them with a case so compelling that they may seek to revamp 
the city's 8-year-old condo-conversion ordinance so it better protects elderly 
tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Zeidman, director of the city Rent Stabilization Division, has taken a 
personal interest in the Rossmore conversion. After years of virtually no condo 
conversions, she said, "we are now in an upswing, and perhaps there is a need 
to look at a more equitable sharing of the profit involved and the grief that 
it causes." 
</P>
<P>
The controversy began in May, 1988, when Haseko-Tekno bought the 48-unit 
building and began a complete renovation of its facade. Since then, according 
to Adams and other tenants, intimidation by management and constant disruptions 
by workers have forced out most renters opposed to the conversion. 
</P>
<P>
"This building is a particularly brutal microcosm of the situation involving 
all condo conversions in the city involving senior citizens," said tenant Jo de 
Winter. "They have put these people through sheer hell." 
</P>
<P>
De Winter opposes the conversion and is incensed that major renovations under 
way for months have disrupted daily life at the complex before the conversion 
has been approved. But many other tenants say it is unfair to hold up the 
project just because a few tenants oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Niezgoda, a stockbroker, has lived in the building for nine years and 
praises the new owners for spending the money to resurrect a building suffering 
from decades of neglect. He wants to buy his apartment, to build up equity, 
gain tax breaks and own a piece of what is widely considered a landmark 
building. Besides, he said, the only other options are to pay much higher rents 
or lose the building, built in 1929, to the wrecker's ball. 
</P>
<P>
"I am being hurt by these delays, and there are others being hurt as well," 
said Niezgoda. He added that tenants opposed to the conversion all are wealthy 
people who "have bargains and just don't want to let go of it." 
</P>
<P>
Although the condo conversion proposal has slowly made its way through the city 
bureaucracy, it has grown uglier at each step, as social issues like the rights 
of the elderly to dignity and affordable housing have been interjected. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can help other senior citizens in the city, it will be worth all the 
hell we've gone through," Adams said. "New York and Boston have protections for 
elderly renters when buildings go condo. Why should Los Angeles have any less?" 
</P>
<P>
Two city planning agencies have approved the condo-conversion plan, and Adams 
appealed both of those decisions. In early February, she filed another appeal 
with the City Council, which is now pending. 
</P>
<P>
Adams acknowledges she may have to leave the building. But she says she is 
concerned mostly that a handful of elderly tenants -- including a disabled 
79-year-old widow and a sick 94-year-old man and his wife -- would have to 
spend their twilight years searching out new bus routes, new friends and new 
doctors and grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
"Please God, I can paddle my own canoe," she said. "But what about them? We're 
a generation who want to be self-sufficient." 
</P>
<P>
Under city law, seniors older than 62 years old, the handicapped and families 
with children are entitled to a $5,000 displacement fee if a new, "comparable 
replacement" apartment is found. 
</P>
<P>
Adams says such compensation would be little consolation for tenants like Grace 
Burner. 
</P>
<P>
Burner, 79, overcame polio and now walks infrequently and with a cane. For 30 
years, she has lived in the building, alone since her husband and three 
children died. A painfully shy woman, she says she dreads having to move 
because she relies on friends in the building and on a routine she has become 
accustomed to over the years. 
</P>
<P>
"I have nightmares," Burner says. 
</P>
<P>
"I am always looking, in my dreams, for a new place, and I always come to a 
place that looks like this," she said, drawing her hands together into the 
shape of a corner. Asked what she thinks the dreams mean, she said: "It means I 
am at a dead end. I just hate those dreams." 
</P>
<P>
The developers say they have been very sensitive to the tenants' concerns, and 
letters from some tenants agree. For instance, Daniel Boulange, president of 
Tekno, says that his firm has offered Burner a handicapped accessible apartment 
in the building for life. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Goldsmith, a lawyer for Haseko-Tekno, says the tenants "can stay until 
they agree another apartment is suitable." He says the management has spent up 
to $12,000 apiece to find new apartments for 11 people, all of whom are very 
satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
Boulange promises to do more than is legally required for Adams and others who 
would not want to purchase their apartments, such as provide them with moving 
fees and rent subsidies -- if they can show that they are low-income. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Adams and others who don't want to leave, Boulange said: 
"There's a lot of things we don't like in life, but in most things it is a 
question of fairness and democracy. Is it fair to prevent 40 others from buying 
their own homes so a few can rent? It is a matter of selfishness versus 
fairness." 
</P>
<P>
Some in City Hall are beginning to question the fairness of the whole process. 
</P>
<P>
Protests led by Adams have halted the approval process, and have won her and 
her allies a hearing before a City Council committee. And last week, she also 
gained the personal intervention of Ferraro and Zeidman. 
</P>
<P>
Like Zeidman, Ferraro said he plans to take a look at the city's 
condo-conversion ordinances, to see if more can be done to protect the elderly. 
In the meantime, Ferraro, the local councilman for Adams, has stepped in to 
mediate the dispute and says he is sympathetic to the elderly tenants. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I'd want to move if I were 94 years old," Ferraro said. "If the 
owner wants to convert that (building) to condos, he has got to make some 
concessions to those elderly and disabled people." 
</P>
<P>
Zeidman also plans to get involved and is launching an investigation into 
alleged harassment of the tenants. She is particularly interested because the 
same owners "have done another troubled condo conversion on the Westside with 
the same problems -- elderly tenants being intimidated, and (the owners) 
creating an unlivable environment, particularly for elderly people, who get 
disgusted and leave." 
</P>
<P>
In the current case, she said: "It begins to look like a clear campaign to 
empty the building in the expectation of reaping a great windfall when turning 
it into condominiums." 
</P>
<P>
Zeidman and Ferraro also said they plan to seek rebates for tenants because of 
the months of renovation that have forced residents to endure numerous 
inconveniences, that have included no windows or security locks, lack of 
promised parking spots and noise and pollution.

BABY'S BIRTH IN GLENDORA WAS AN EARTH-MOVING EXPERIENCE

While many San Gabriel Valley residents were scrambling for desks and doorways 
during Wednesday's earthquake, Tami Harshberger was on the delivery table at 
Foothill Presbyterian Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
At 3:53 p.m. Wednesday, 10 minutes after the quake rolled through the Los 
Angeles area and 6 1/2 hours after her mother went into labor, Stephanie Nicole 
Harshberger, an eight-pound, blue-eyed blonde, was born. 
</P>
<P>
Harshberger, 28, of Covina, was in the middle of a contraction when the 
first-floor delivery room at the hospital in Glendora started swaying. 
</P>
<P>
The delivery room nurse dove for a nearby doorway, but quickly returned to the 
table. 
</P>
<P>
Harshberger stopped pushing. "I thought for sure the ceiling was going to start 
caving in," she said. Her obstetrician, Steve S. Ho, told her to calm down and 
continue breathing. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, Stephanie was born. 
</P>
<P>
It was Ho's first quake baby delivery, but not the last. 
</P>
<P>
Several hours later, when an aftershock hit at 7:24 p.m., Ho was with another 
expectant mother, this time at Inter-Community Medical Center in Covina. 
</P>
<P>
The delivery room nurse, Cheryl Meyer, was in the same hospital on Oct. 1, 
1987, the date of the Whittier Narrows temblor. Meyer had been assisting a 
Caesarean section birth when the ground started shaking. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not superstitious in this regard," Ho said Thursday. "It must be some 
unforeseen force that causes more babies to be delivered during an earthquake. 
It's just like gravity and a full moon." 
</P>
<P>
The Harshbergers, however, said the timing of the birth of their second 
daughter may have been a good omen. 
</P>
<P>
"It's got to mean something," father Kevin Harshberger, 32, who had been in the 
delivery room, said Thursday. "She was born the day the earth moved. . . . 
Maybe we should've played Lotto last night."

EX-AIDE HIRED AS NEW BEVERLY HILLS MANAGER; 
</P>

GOVERNMENT: MARK SCOTT IS QUITTING HIS 2-MONTH-OLD JOB AS COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT 
CHIEF FOR SANTA CLARITA TO SUCCEED HIS FORMER BOSS.

Faced with the imminent departure of their veteran city manager, members of the 
Beverly Hills City Council called on one of his former top aides to take over 
at a time when the city faces the pressure of increased costs for completion of 
its monumental Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Scott, who left Beverly Hills for the new city of Santa Clarita two months 
ago, said that he mulled over the invitation while he was snowed in at Lake 
Arrowhead during a weekend ski trip last month. 
</P>
<P>
"I had just hit 40, and when people hit 40 they do things," Scott said of his 
recent departure from Beverly Hills, where he was in charge of planning, 
transportation and building and safety before he became director of community 
development in Santa Clarita in December. 
</P>
<P>
Although the moving boxes were hardly unpacked at his new office, the siren 
song of his old employers proved impossible to resist, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just that this is my home away from home," Scott said of Beverly Hills. 
"Hopefully, my mid-life crisis will be over real quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Scott will be making about $115,000 a year in his new job. He is scheduled to 
succeed City Manager Edward S. Kreins on April 2. 
</P>
<P>
Kreins, who ran city government for 10 years, announced his retirement shortly 
after a payment dispute stalled construction of the Civic Center project in 
January. He will stay on through June as a consultant to his successor. 
</P>
<P>
Although budget officials say Beverly Hills will not have to raise taxes in the 
foreseeable future, Scott will be required to make higher interest payments to 
finance construction of the Civic Center and renovation of the 58-year-old City 
Hall while maintaining the city's high level of police, fire and other 
services. 
</P>
<P>
The annual interest payment, now about $6 million, is scheduled to go up to 
$8.5 million in July as part of a 30-year refinancing that raised $115 million 
last November. 
</P>
<P>
Although the refinancing was intended to pay for construction costs and provide 
several million dollars extra to finance other programs, a $14.5-million 
dispute with the city's general contractor may eat up much of the money. 
</P>
<P>
The city has already paid about $52.5 million for its new police headquarters 
and a renovated and expanded library, which were 90% completed before 
contractor J.A. Jones Inc. walked off the job in mid-January. 
</P>
<P>
A new fire headquarters and parking structure are already complete, and work 
continues on the City Hall renovation. 
</P>
<P>
"The budget is going to be tough," Scott said. If he had it to do over, 
"there'd be things we'd do differently. Anybody here would tell you that." 
</P>
<P>
In choosing Scott, the council decided to go with a known quantity rather than 
stage a nationwide search for a new city manager. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone who has worked with you agrees that more than being efficient, you 
are caring and have sympathy for people, which is important," Mayor Max Salter 
said when Scott's appointment was announced at a special meeting of the City 
Council on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We've worked with you day in and out. You've been on the firing line, and 
you've shown the ability to meet that high standard," said Vice Mayor Allan L. 
Alexander. He also praised Scott as an effective communicator. 
</P>
<P>
Scott will be replacing a strong-willed executive who prided himself on hiring 
all but one of the city's top 20 executives during his 10 years on the job. 
</P>
<P>
But Scott said he has no problem with a suggestion by Councilman Robert K. 
Tanenbaum that hiring of key staffers be done with the consent of elected 
officials. Tanenbaum raised the idea at a cocktail party held last week to 
launch his reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"When smart city managers hire people, they confer with their city councils in 
any event," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, who came to Beverly Hills as executive assistant to Kreins in 1983, had 
been director of environmental services for three years in Beverly Hills when 
he left for Santa Clarita, whose population of about 150,000 compares to 30,000 
for his once and future employer. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very surprised and saddened to see him go, because Mark is a very 
excellent worker and person," said Gail Foy, spokeswoman for the 2-year-old 
city, which covers 40 square miles and includes the communities of Saugus, 
Newhall, Valencia and parts of Canyon Country.

LA PUENTE TWINS SELECTED TO TOUR EAST BLOC AS STUDENT 'AMBASSADORS'

<P>
For Joann and Talolo Lepale, political and social changes in Eastern Europe and 
Moscow have been something to experience through the evening news. But now they 
just might get the chance to bring home a piece of the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
The Lepale twins, 16, have been chosen to participate this summer in the People 
to People High School Student Ambassador Program. People to People is a 
nonprofit organization that takes selected students from around the United 
States on learning trips to different parts of the world. Students are chosen 
on the basis of academic achievement, community involvement and recommendations 
from teachers and counselors. 
</P>
<P>
One of the deciding factors in the Lepale twins' selection was their three-year 
involvement with a community drug-prevention program called "Friend-to-Friend," 
according to Delegation Leader Patricia Sako. Both Talolo and Joann go to 
neighborhood schools to talk about ways to avoid getting involved with drug 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
The Lepales, juniors at Bassett High School, have a problem. All students must 
pay their own way, which means the Lepale twins, whose mother is a hospital 
worker and father is a mechanic, must come up with $4,000 each before April 1. 
</P>
<P>
Sako said it is a lot easier for other families to come up with the money 
because they usually have only one child to pay for. But the Lepale twins are 
inseparable. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since they were notified of their acceptance in January, the twins, who 
have never traveled out of the country, have worked to raise money. They, along 
with their parents and 8-year-old sister, have devoted several weekends to 
collecting cans and newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
They have sent out 110 letters to clubs and organizations in the San Gabriel 
Valley asking for donations. In March they are planning a car wash and a yard 
sale. So far, they have collected $410. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been doing everything we can to raise the money," said their mother, 
Yonneta Lepale. "I have been following every lead anybody gives me." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the proudest mother on the block . . . I just wish I had the money to pay 
for the trip myself." 
</P>
<P>
The Lepale twins are the only students selected so far in the San Gabriel 
Valley; others were being interviewed last week. 
</P>
<P>
If they raise the money, they will join 2,000 other high school students on a 
31-day trip to England, the Soviet Union and Poland, as well as the cities of 
Paris, Amsterdam in the Netherlands, and East and West Berlin. The students 
stay at college dorms, hotels and in Dutch and English homes. 
</P>
<P>
The trip will include a visit to historic sites and government offices, 
including the Kremlin in Moscow, the birthplace of composer Frederic Chopin in 
Poland and a walk through the gardens of Versailles in France. 
</P>
<P>
"All these years we've been reading about these places and now we have the 
chance to actually see them," Joann said. "It's going to be like walking 
through a history book." 
</P>
<P>
The twins said one of the main places they look forward to seeing is the new 
McDonald's in Moscow.

PROPERTY RIGHTS IN SANTA MONICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Monica City Council is behind the times. While the yoke of oppression 
has been lifted from the shoulders of East Germans, Czechs, Hungarians and 
Poles, Santa Monica landlords are still fighting to regain their property 
rights (Times, March 1). 
</P>
<P>
If capitalism and democracy have been revived in these countries, it might work 
in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Even President Gorbachev has just pushed through a measure for the private use 
of land by Soviet citizens. The economic failures of Marxism are as evident in 
Santa Monica as they are in the Eastern Bloc countries. As economic freedoms 
are restored to these nations, Santa Monica apartment owners, at the least, 
deserve the return of their property rights. Gorbachev's reforms, if emulated 
in Santa Monica, would most likely provide for the elimination of the Rent 
Control Board; then, hundreds of boarded-up apartments would return to the 
rental pool where they belong.

GALANTER AND HER $100,000 FUND-RAISER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(Times staff writer Jeff) Rabin seems surprised that Councilwoman Ruth Galanter 
raised $100,000 during a single fund-raising event. 
</P>
<P>
As a resident of her district, I am surprised that the figure was not many 
times greater, what with the liberal favors she has bestowed on the developers 
who are trashing our neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter's indulgence of her schoolgirl fantasy of being in with the in crowd 
at the expense of the people she purportedly represents is obscene. She should 
be running for homecoming queen and leave public office to a more mature 
individual.

NEW CHIEF OF ARCADIA DISTRICT FAVORS MORE SCHOOL AUTONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Terry M. Towner, the 51-year-old Los Gatos educator who will take over as 
superintendent of the Arcadia Unified School District on July 1, calls students 
"clients" and wants to allow individual schools greater freedom in making 
budget and program decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're going to be giving more autonomy and authority to each school to 
run its program," said Towner, in a telephone interview from Los Gatos, near 
San Jose, where he is the superintendent of the 3,000-student Los 
Gatos-Saratoga Joint Union High School District. 
</P>
<P>
Towner, whose appointment to the $91,000-a-year post ends a four-month national 
search, replaces Stephen A. Goldstone, who left Arcadia in September to become 
superintendent of the Chino Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Arcadia, an upscale school district with 7,800 students, presents a variety of 
challenges for Towner, who spent his adolescent years in the San Gabriel Valley 
and attended Pasadena High School. 
</P>
<P>
Although Arcadia students regularly score high on standardized tests, the 
district, like many in the San Gabriel Valley, is grappling with demographic 
changes, as well as with gang activity that officials hope to stem before it 
escalates. Last fall, in an attempt to discourage gang attire, the Arcadia 
school board outlawed the wearing of baseball caps. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest issues facing Arcadia educators is whether the state will 
allow Sierra Madre to secede from the Pasadena school district and join 
Arcadia. A group of parents have petitioned for the move, citing Pasadena's low 
scores on standardized tests and claiming that the district has too many gangs 
and too much on-campus violence. Their request, which was denied by Los Angeles 
County education officials last year, is expected to go before the State Board 
of Education this spring. 
</P>
<P>
On the secession debate, Towner, while admitting he hasn't fully studied the 
issue, said he tends to favor allowing Sierra Madre to join Arcadia Unified. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have room and interest then I think it deserves a serious look," Towner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Philosophically, I feel that parents have the right to send their kids to the 
best education they can get," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The new superintendent also believes that parents and teachers should have a 
stronger say in what happens at their local schools. He believes that giving 
parents and teachers more authority and responsibility leads them to strive for 
excellence. And he said he wants to create a climate that rewards individual 
initiative and talent instead of stifling it. 
</P>
<P>
Towner calls it the business approach to education. 
</P>
<P>
"I talk about our students as clients because they deserve all the attention 
that any client should get. Programs should be centered around student 
success." 
</P>
<P>
Towner said another priority in his new job will be to improve labor relations 
by ending the adversarial tone that has permeated collective bargaining in the 
past. He said he hopes to establish a more trusting relationship by involving 
district employees in decision-making from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Towner is now working as a consultant for Arcadia Unified while still running 
the Los Gatos high school district. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to going to Los Gatos in 1985, he was assistant superintendent of the 
Novato Unified School District in Marin County. He has also served as director 
of secondary education in the Conejo Valley Unified School District and 
principal of Ventura High School. 
</P>
<P>
Towner, who has a master's degree in Latin American and Asian history from Cal 
State Los Angeles and a Ph.D. in education from the University of Southern 
California, said he expects that his familiarity with Asian and Latino cultures 
will help him in his new job. 
</P>
<P>
Arcadia's student body is 54% white, 36.4% Asian, Pacific Islander and 
Filipino, 8.8% Latino and .8% black. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I have an understanding of Asian and Latin culture and a sensitivity 
to it," he said.

NOLAN UNLIKELY TO STAND PAT IN CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH and MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Facing his most difficult election in 12 years, Republican Assemblyman Pat 
Nolan kicked off his campaign for a seventh term in the Assembly two weeks ago 
with a rousing endorsement from Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing 600 Nolan backers at a $150-per-person reception in Pasadena, 
Deukmejian praised the former Republican Assembly leader as a close personal 
friend and key player in his administration. 
</P>
<P>
"While I'm not going to be there next year and the years after, I sure will be 
able to sleep better if I know that Pat's going to be reelected," Deukmejian 
told a cheering crowd at the Doubletree Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The staunchly conservative Nolan, 39, has easily carried the heavily Republican 
41st Assembly District, which includes a large part of Pasadena, Altadena, 
Glendale and Eagle Rock, since winning it in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
However, he now faces uncertainty as a result of being tied to an FBI 
investigation into alleged corruption in the Legislature. Although Nolan has 
neither been charged nor indicted, he remains a target for prosecution, 
according to sources close to the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan has no Republican challenger in the June 5 primary but could face harsh 
attack from a seasoned Democrat in the November final. 
</P>
<P>
Vying for the Democratic nomination in June are Jeanette Mann, a trustee for 
the Pasadena Community College District, and Rod McKenzie, professor of 
geography at USC. Peace and Freedom David Velasquez is also a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Mann, 53, said she plans to hit Nolan hard on ethics. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that Mr. Nolan will be indicted," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mann appears to have the jump on her Democratic opponent, McKenzie, 52, who 
characterizes himself as "just a classic academician." 
</P>
<P>
But he said he hoped to appeal more widely to voters than Mann because of her 
liberal posture. He said he will refrain from talking about possible 
prosecution of Nolan. 
</P>
<P>
"My presumption is that until he has been proven guilty, the man is innocent," 
McKenzie said. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible that Nolan's status will not be resolved until after the 
November election, rendering it an inevitable question during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The federal political corruption investigation surfaced in August, 1988, when 
Nolan's Capitol office was raided by FBI agents. The investigation, including 
an elaborate sting operation, led to the indictment of Sen. Joseph B. Montoya 
(D-Whittier), who was convicted in February of seven counts of extortion, 
racketeering and money laundering. Montoya resigned from the Senate shortly 
after his conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Among the key pieces of evidence that emerged during Montoya's trial was that 
Nolan, then the Assembly Republican leader, was arranging with Senate staffer 
John Shahabian, a government informant, to receive campaign contributions from 
a dummy shrimp company set up by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
Also, last November a former top Nolan aide, Karin Watson, pleaded guilty in 
U.S. District Court to extorting $12,500 for Republican lawmakers in exchange 
for help in passing a bill to benefit the bogus shrimp company. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Nolan, four other elected officials were ensnared in the 
undercover sting operation that led to Montoya's indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan has said he did nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"No one has accused me of doing anything," Nolan said in an interview last 
week. "I say when the investigation is concluded, I think I'll be completely 
exonerated." 
</P>
<P>
But the inquiry, coupled with Republican setbacks in the 1988 elections, led to 
Nolan's losing his position of GOP Assembly leader. That position gave Nolan a 
statewide profile and took him all around California as a spokesman for his 
party. "I had to be from one end of the state to another," Nolan acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
Although he won again easily in 1988, Nolan suffered a discernible erosion of 
his commanding margin of victory. In his second run at Nolan, Democrat John 
Vollbrecht increased his vote tally more than 50% from just under 30,000 to 
more than 45,000, while Nolan added only about 3,000 votes to his first count 
of 69,508 -- in a presidential election year when more voters traditionally go 
to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
One source close to Nolan, who asked not to be identified, said the assemblyman 
was buoyed by the outcome of a recent special Senate election in which 
Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier), also a target of the FBI investigation, 
won the GOP nomination. The success of Hill, the source said, "confirmed Pat's 
belief that things aren't that bad." 
</P>
<P>
Some of his colleagues say that faced with the federal probe, the veteran 
lawmaker is acting more like a freshman lawmaker popping up at a variety of 
events in his district, sometimes several in a day. Now, relieved of his 
statewide duties, which included fund raising for other candidates, Nolan said 
he can spend more time in the district. 
</P>
<P>
Since he lost his leadership post, Nolan has been involved in more issues that 
are popular with leaders in his district -- pushing for legislation to block 
parole offices near homes, toughening the penalties for auto theft and 
equalizing state funding for school districts. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan acknowledged that his district is becoming more ethnically diverse with 
an influx of Latinos, Armenians and Koreans, diluting his primary power base of 
conservative, middle-income whites. And he noted that Democrat Michael S. 
Dukakis carried Pasadena in the last presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
But Nolan said his constituents continue to like his brand of conservative 
politics. "I feel that people feel that I've been a good, solid 
representative," Nolan said. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian played on that sentiment in his endorsement two weeks ago, praising 
Nolan's contributions to the Republican agenda of the '80s: holding down the 
budget, building the economy and getting tough on crime. 
</P>
<P>
Among Democratic party operatives, there is disagreement over whether Nolan is 
vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Floyd (D-Carson), who explored the possibility of 
attempting to recall Nolan about two years ago, asserted that Nolan's 
conservative record is not in tune with the state's voters. Floyd remains angry 
about Nolan's alleged involvement in the preparation of phony presidential 
endorsement letters mailed on behalf of Floyd's GOP opponent in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But other Democrats acknowledge that it would be difficult to unseat Nolan 
unless he is indicted in connection with the federal investigation before the 
November general election. 
</P>
<P>
With the investigation "over his head," Nolan must go out and talk to voters, 
said Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles), who also represents Pasadena. 
But, he said, "it's a tough district for Democrats to win because of the 
registration" edge. According to the Jan. 2 report of the registrar of voters, 
Republicans outnumber Democrats 78,805 to 64,745. 
</P>
<P>
Both Democrats seeking the nomination said they are counting on isolating Nolan 
on the far right, especially on the question of abortion and family planning, 
which they believe will attract Republican voters. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure there are a lot of Republican women, particularly professional 
Republican women, who support choice," Mann said. She said she believes that 
they would consider voting Democratic now that the U.S. Supreme Court has 
allowed state legislatures to adopt laws restricting abortion. 
</P>
<P>
McKenzie, who is pro-choice, said he thinks abortion and family planning will 
be the most significant campaign issue, even though Nolan recently supported a 
measure to restore cuts to family planning agencies. "I think Pat's position 
against pro-choice is fairly clear. I don't think one fairly recent vote makes 
a convert out of him." 
</P>
<P>
Nolan described himself as "personally pro-life" but emphasized that the 
Legislature seldom, if ever, considers the abortion issue. Instead, Nolan said, 
lawmakers confront such related issues as whether minors should be required to 
obtain parental consent before an abortion. Saying parents should be involved 
in the decision, Nolan said he supports parental consent. 
</P>
<P>
McKenzie, who taught Nolan in his geography class at USC in the 1970s, said his 
strategy is to develop grass-roots support based on his central position. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the voters will see that I stand where they do, in the center," he 
said, "a little right on foreign, a little left on domestic." 
</P>
<P>
Nolan said he has joked with his former professor about the possibility of 
their being opponents. Nolan predicted that it would "be a lively dialogue" 
should McKenzie win the Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
"Pat will characterize me as a liberal," McKenzie said. He said he thinks it 
would "come down to which candidate comes closer to the center position." 
</P>
<P>
McKenzie, however, has conceded that his Democratic rival enjoys a considerable 
advantage through her past political experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm running in a weakened posture because Jeanette is an old pro," he said of 
Mann. 
</P>
<P>
Mann, director of affirmative action at Cal State Northridge, got her first 
taste of politics as a "precinct man" in the Illinois system of Chicago's first 
Mayor Richard Daley. 
</P>
<P>
In her first crack at elected office, Mann in 1983 unseated a former mayor of 
Sierra Madre, Gary Adams, from the Pasadena City College District. She was 
reelected in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Mann set a goal of raising $100,000 to $150,000 locally to show Democratic 
Party leaders that she can beat Nolan. Then, with an infusion of party money, 
she hopes to strike on ethics and abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the people in the 41st District need to be represented by 
someone who shares their ethical and moral values, and I do," she said. 
</P>

FANFARE FOR A CONDUCTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pacific Symphony has selected a new music director, which is good news. 
Carl St. Clair, an assistant conductor of the Boston Symphony, brings an 
impressive resume to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
More important, his appointment should signal a period of stability for the 
orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
That's significant because of the change and uncertainty it has been through in 
the last couple of years. There was the resignation of founder Keith Clark as 
an administrator, after a period of tension with the board. Then there was the 
search for a new conductor, which has taken a while. The orchestra can benefit 
from new beginnings, and from having a young, bright conductor at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
St. Clair has said he will continue as music director of either the Ann Arbor 
Symphony in Michigan or the Cayuga Chamber Orchestra of Ithaca, N.Y. He plans 
to spend about three months in Orange County next year, eight weeks for 
concerts and other time devoted to administrative matters. 
</P>
<P>
Three months may not seem like much time for the tasks at hand: planning and 
conducting six pairs of classical concerts at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center, two concerts at the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre and overseeing school 
and community programs. However, it's a fact of life these days that good 
conductors split their time between various commitments and that to sign on 
somebody good, a community has to be willing to share conductors. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition of a talented music director is an exciting prospect for an 
orchestra that has received increased visibility with its move to the 
Performing Arts Center. We welcome St. Clair to Orange County and look forward 
to hearing the orchestra under his direction.

SOUTH COUNTY NEED FOR ADDED DEPUTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County Board of Supervisors recently postponed the approval of more 
deputies for South Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
This area has had phenomenal growth in the past five years, while the number of 
deputies for the area has remained constant. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors didn't hesitate to approve development in South Orange County, 
but now hesitate to allow residents in this area to have equal protection 
afforded to the area. 
</P>
<P>
One has to wonder if the county board is not a puppet of developers. Voters 
should remember this when the time comes to make changes.

PENALTY FOR DOCTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In The Times (Feb. 22), there was a news item regarding a doctor in Anaheim who 
was suspended for 90 days and put on 10 years' probation by the State Board of 
Medical Quality Assurance for admittedly filing false workers' compensation 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
If the medical profession wishes to retain any respect for its so-called high 
ethics, then it's high time they took drastic steps in cases such as this, 
instead of the slap-on-the-wrist punishment they administer. 
</P>
<P>
Why not take away a license permanently? Perhaps to some this is a high price 
to pay, but it would show others that a license to practice medicine is not 
also a license to steal.

TAKING SIDES ON IRVINE PARK BOND; 
</P>
<P>
YES: RESIDENTS WILL ENJOY INCREASED AMENITIES AS WELL AS A BOOST IN PROPERTY 
VALUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAULA WERNER, Paula Werner is a member of the Irvine City Council. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A yes vote on Proposition Parks means Irvine intends to finish the job begun in 
1974 with our first park bond. That investment 16 years ago provided the parks 
and facilities we currently enjoy, which have helped assure Irvine a national 
reputation as a great place to live. 
</P>
<P>
Voting yes on Proposition Parks provides our seniors their long-awaited senior 
center and day-care center and assures our youth and adult sports teams more 
playing fields -- some lighted. A gymnasium, serving both daytime Irvine High 
students and evening community groups, will be built. Woodbridge, Northwood and 
Westpark will each receive a major community park. 
</P>
<P>
A family/human services center, a child-care facility, 13 miles of new bike 
trails, a model farm (Irvine's agricultural heritage museum), landscaping 
Northwood Railway and the Edison easements as well as improvements to all 
existing park facilities are among the projects that would benefit Irvine 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
We must finish the job begun in 1974. Our 105,000 population will double in the 
next 20 years, and current parks and facilities won't be adequate. Already our 
senior facilities are inadequate and our sports fields, fine arts facility and 
swimming complex are overscheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in January, 1989, hundreds of residents petitioned the city for more 
than $100 million in recreational facilities and projects. During an 
eight-month hearing process at City Hall and in the neighborhoods, the 
residents outlined their needs. The council cut these requests to the $57.5 
million bond before you March 6. 
</P>
<P>
The council's criteria for project inclusion were: need and diversity. Each 
geographical section and various recreational interests in the city should 
derive benefit. The wide range of opportunities provided are those we will be 
touting to our guests and visitors, to prospective business partners and new 
businesses, and to prospective home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
This park bond is a worthwhile investment when you consider the 27 projects 
being funded. You, individually, will gain from the recreational opportunities 
offered and the increased value of your home. Businesses will benefit from the 
dynamic growth that comes from people moving into a growing and desired 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Mello-Roos Community Facilities bonds allow for construction, maintenance and 
operation funding. Given staff-projected city expenditures and revenues, there 
are insufficient funds available in the general fund to provide, maintain and 
operate these new recreational projects. To provide outstanding recreational 
facilities, then allow them to fall into disrepair because of inadequate 
maintenance funding, is the height of fiscal irresponsibility. 
</P>
<P>
In that situation, future City Councils would be forced to return to the voters 
every few years for additional taxes. A more honest approach is to provide for 
future infrastructure in a comprehensive, "total funding" package. You won't be 
nickeled and dimed and dollared to death in coming years with repeated tax 
increases because we failed to be fiscally responsible. And you won't dread 
driving past a browned-out park area or see facilities closed because of a lack 
of foresight on government's part in planning for operation and maintenance 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
Those old sayings that "nothing worth having is free" and "you get what you pay 
for" apply to Irvine's Proposition Parks. 
</P>
<P>
The dollars currently available in the city's coffers are restricted to 
specific uses such as capital improvements (roads, lights), economic 
uncertainties and rehabilitation reserves or are already designated for other 
purposes. In summary, Irvine is solvent because we have prudently planned 
balanced budgets. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine voters should keep the park bond numbers in perspective. In 20 years the 
total investment is less than $3,000 for your family. Our homes appreciate far 
more than that in one year, partly because of the very amenities this park bond 
provides. You, your family, friends and visitors can use and enjoy these 
projects as long as you're here -- for less than a can of soda a day! 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, had the 1974 park bond voters been scared off by total costs 
aggregation, we wouldn't have the desirable Irvine community we know today. 
</P>
<P>
The March election was scheduled for two reasons: to ensure that residents vote 
on the park bond unhampered by the politics of the City Council/mayoral races 
in June and to save money. The election costs are less than the additional 
inflationary costs of these projects in three months' time. 
</P>
<P>
Let's finish the job begun in 1974. Let's continue the progress and provision 
of those amenities that we enjoy and that add to our investment in our homes 
and community. Join with the unanimous approval of the Board of Education and 
the City Council in voting yes on Proposition Parks.

The "silent majority" is sick and tired of Sheriff (Brad) Gates' errors in 
judgment. He continues to cost we taxpayers excessive amounts of monies for 
attorney fees, court costs and settlement damages. 
</P>
<P>
Why should the County Board of Supervisors authorize these payments? Let him be 
responsible for his own actions and surely he'll be far more careful.

ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So it has finally come to light that the Marine Corps Air Station in El Toro 
has been polluting our ground water and the atmosphere, plus the horrendous 
noise pollution and ever-present danger of crashes with live bombs and flares 
aboard! 
</P>
<P>
For more that 40 years, this has been going on according to the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency! Hasn't anyone told the Marine Corps that World 
War II is over? 
</P>
<P>
The Marine Corps Air Station at El Toro should be at the top of Defense 
Secretary Richard Cheney's list of bases to shut down. Their so-called 
"Mission" has been obsolete for more than 20 years, and this very expensive 
"country club" has been nothing but an unnecessary expense to the taxpayers for 
much too long a time. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by residential housing now and with Orange County bursting at the 
seams with the tremendous demand for affordable housing, how about plowing up 
those runways and giving our harassed residents a fair shake for a change!

DEFEAT OF EFFORT TO RECALL MISSION VIEJO COUNCILMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We're lucky to be witnessing such amazing political changes around the world. 
</P>
<P>
First we see the Soviet Union, Romania and other Eastern Bloc countries 
changing their political system to permit dissenting points of view. 
</P>
<P>
Now this momentum has spread to Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
One of the five Mission Viejo council members, Robert A. Curtis, dared to 
express points of view that put him at odds with the powerful Mission Viejo 
Co., the town's builder. The company was so fearful of this lone voice of 
dissent that they and their friends spent $500,000 in a failed effort to recall 
him, while he defended himself with a paltry $39,000. It's probably a good 
thing that the company doesn't own tanks, tear gas and "re-education" camps. To 
top it off, a couple of Curtis' fellow council members took the unusual action 
of joining the recall effort against their colleague. 
</P>
<P>
Now let's see what happens in November when these council members are up for 
reelection. Will the council members take money from the company? Will the 
company's endorsement be their "kiss of death?" Or will the council members get 
the voters' message that they want controlled growth and independent-minded 
representatives?

A DEVICE TO TRACK DOWN BANK ROBBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re "Device to Track Bank Robbers Challenged (Feb. 27)." 
</P>
<P>
Your anti-police attitude has once again reared its ugly head. The Orange 
County agencies finally have a new tool that can have a very positive impact on 
catching bank robbers. 
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that they asked you to not print this article so the bank robbers 
would not know about the device, thus decreasing the chance of catching the 
bank robbers. Did this stop you? Of course not. 
</P>
<P>
A ridiculous statement was made by (H. Dean) Steward (head of the federal 
public defender's office in Santa Ana). He said, "If everyone knows it is in 
the bank, they will be less likely to rob it." That is a typical statement of a 
public defender whose job it is to defend the bank robbers. Talk about your 
head in the sand. The robbers know about the cameras and exploding dye packs, 
and they still commit the robberies. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks for taking an outstanding device to help the police catch felony 
suspects and make it less effective by telling the robbers about the device. 
Your article once again makes a difficult job more difficult. This is 
irresponsible journalism.

USD MOVES UP TO NEXT WCC STEP

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pat Holbert began this season as a second-string guard for the University of 
San Diego. He's finishing it a star. 
</P>
<P>
Holbert, who matched his career high of 27 points, made a seldom seen 
four-point play late to give USD an 80-74 victory over San Francisco Saturday 
night in a first-round West Coast Conference tournament game at Loyola 
Marymount's Gersten Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
USD's victory, its first conference tournament victory in three years, means 
the Toreros will play Pepperdine in the semifinals here tonight at 7. USF, 
which has yet to win a tournament game in the four years of its existence, 
finished a terribly disappointing season 8-20. The Dons lost eight of their 
last nine games. 
</P>
<P>
USD, which began the year 3-7, has won nine of 11 and 13 of 18 since late 
December. It improved to 16-12. 
</P>
<P>
With USD holding a tenuous 67-65 lead with two minutes 38 seconds left, Holbert 
took a pass out on USD's right wing and went up for a three-point shot. It went 
down -- his fifth of the game to do so -- and Holbert went to the line as not 
even Scott McWhorter could stop him with a foul. Holbert, the WCC's fourth-best 
free-throw shooter at 84%, made the free throw giving USD a 71-65 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Shawn Sykes (20 points) made his third three-pointer 20 seconds later as the 
Dons pulled within three, but USD made four of five and six of seven free 
throws down the stretch to ice it. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year we would execute our offense awfully well and then teams would 
decide to double down low and we couldn't really hit the outside shot," Egan 
said. "Pat has added that dimension. He's a very good shooter." 
</P>
<P>
USD had things going its way early. It used a 11-2 run to pull ahead, 18-11, 
nine minutes into the game. John Jerome made a basket and a free throw, Craig 
Cottrell a driving layup and a 15-foot jumper and Holbert a layup and a 
19-footer. 
</P>
<P>
USF struggled to get any continuity going and did not have a player with more 
than one basket until Sykes hit a jumper with 9:02 left. On the play, Jerome 
picked up his second foul and was out the rest of the half. 
</P>
<P>
Joel DeBortoli, an All-WCC selection and USF's leading scorer at 18.2 points 
per game, did not score until 10:13 remained in the first half. He finished the 
game with a team-high 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Colvin, starting at center in place of Dondi Bell who has been slowed 
with an inflamed hip, covered DeBortoli early on. Then it was Dondi Bell, who 
swatted away his first shot. Dondi Bell also blocked a James Bell shot during 
USD's 11-2 run. 
</P>
<P>
With Jerome out, USF went on a 10-0 run and pulled ahead, 28-24, with 7:18 
left. 
</P>
<P>
That was when Kelvin Woods and Anthony Thomas took over. During the final seven 
minutes of the half, Woods scored nine points, Thomas eight and USF seven. 
</P>
<P>
It was Woods' driving layup with two seconds left that gave USD its 41-35 
halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Holbert had 13 of USD's first 24 points making five of seven shots, including 
three of five three-pointers. Holbert, a transfer from Mesa (Arizona) Community 
College and an All-WCC honorable mention, was USD's leading outside shooter 
this season making 45% (49 of 109) from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
Many felt he should have been a first-team selection. "I'm really not that 
worried about it. As long as we keep playing well," Holbert said. "If not this 
year, maybe next year. The coaches that didn't vote for me, I hope I get the 
chance to play against their team next year." 
</P>
<P>
"Next year I'm going for MVP," he said laughing. 
</P>
<P>
USD, which outrebounded USF in two earlier contests this season, had a 19-13 
advantage in the first half and 37-30 overall. 
</P>
<P>
USF was more aggressive after the intermission and pulled to within, 43-42, but 
Cottrell scored nine of the game's next 11 points to provide some comfort for 
the Toreros. 
</P>
<P>
Among two USF free throws, Jerome made a short bank shot, Woods a pair of 
baskets and Holbert a layup to give USD an 11-point lead (57-46) with 12:42 
left. After DeBortoli and Jerome exchanged baskets, USF scored nine in a row 
and trailed by just 59-57. 
</P>
<P>
But Holbert answered that with a personal five-point run over the next 12 
seconds making his fourth three-pointer and a flying, left-hand slam after a 
steal at the top of the Dons' key.

SOCKERS HOLD OFF CLEVELAND

SAN DIEGO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has been a year and eight days since Waad Hirmez returned to the Sockers 
from a frightful half-season with the Los Angeles Lazers. 
</P>
<P>
And Saturday night, following the Sockers' 5-2 victory over the Cleveland 
Crunch (14-22) before 7,944 at the San Diego Sports Arena, life was good again. 
A heaping spoonful of chuckles. 
</P>
<P>
This, despite all the losses. Despite the fact that the team is still missing 
Branko Segota and Brian Quinn, its offensive bulwark. And despite all the games 
that Hirmez has looked a step slow and a touch off his game. 
</P>
<P>
"A year later, I'm back here in San Diego," said Hirmez, who scored two goals 
to give him seven in his past four games. "I'm the happiest person at the 
moment. I never wanted to leave San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
And now, courtesy of Mr. Hirmez, we have the "Cliche of the Game" award. 
Hirmez, asked about the Sockers' chances to get back into the Western Division 
race, responded: "It's not over until the fat lady sings." 
</P>
<P>
Come on, Waad. 
</P>
<P>
"That's right, baby," he said. "You've got it. I'm not giving up." 
</P>
<P>
Hirmez's second goal came with 6:16 remaining and the Sockers clutching a 3-2 
lead, which is not much of a lead at all the way the Sockers have played this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, midfielder Ben Collins set things up beautifully for Hirmez, pulling 
the Cleveland defense to the right and sending a pass back to Hirmez, who sent 
the ball into what was virtually an empty net. Of course, Hirmez jumped on the 
glass to celebrate his accomplishment, which keeps the Sockers (16-21) in third 
place in the Western Division, six games behind first-place Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Hirmez's hot streak was perhaps prompted by Socker Coach Ron Newman, who 
benched him for two games following his return from a four-game layoff with a 
hamstring injury. Hirmez didn't like sitting and decided to do something about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"He felt I wasn't sharp enough," Hirmez said. "I really got upset about that. I 
wanted to go out and prove to him that I am as sharp as ever." 
</P>
<P>
As they did in Friday's 4-3 loss to St. Louis, the Sockers jumped to a 2-0 lead 
early on a first-quarter goal by Zoran Karic and a second-quarter goal by 
Hirmez. Karic took a chip from Cacho, turned and sent the ball into the right 
corner over the head of goalie Otto Orf, who played for the Sockers during the 
second half of last season. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the second quarter, Hirmez took a crossing pass from defender Ralph 
Black and punched it in left-footed to make it 2-0. St. Louis midfielder 
Michael King scored as the quarter closed, dribbling left and sending a 
carpet-hugger past goalie Victor Nogueira, who stabbed at the ball from his 
knees. 
</P>
<P>
Black scored his eighth goal of the season through defender Drew Ferguson's 
legs 1:35 into the third quarter to make it 3-1. Late in the quarter, former 
Socker Paul Wright fed midfielder Dev Reeves, who knocked it in from the left 
side of the goal mouth to again tighten the game. 
</P>
<P>
Hirmez took care of things after that with some late help from forward Jim 
Gabarra, who slipped a shot between Orf's legs to give the Sockers their 
three-goal margin of victory. 
</P>
<P>
A much-needed 10-day rest lies ahead, which is as good a time as any for this 
team to hunt down a bit of consistency and heal their bangs and bruises. This 
team still has a lot to prove and wants very much to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard some of our fans saying we're not going to make the playoffs this 
year," Black said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Socker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Owner Ron Fowler said Saturday that the Sockers are still involved in serious 
trade negotiations with two teams, but talks with the St. Louis Storm have 
cooled. "I would be surprised if we were able to work a trade with St. Louis," 
he said. "I think they feel we are desperate to make a trade. What they want 
and what they are proposing does not make any sense. Two of the teams felt we 
were very, very desperate." . . . The Sockers have a 10-day break -- their 
second longest this season -- before they play host to St. Louis March 13. . . 
. Saturday's game concluded the ninth of an MISL-leading 13 back-to-back 
series.

DRIVEN THOMAS GEARS PISTONS FOR REPEAT 
</P>

<P>
Brendan Malone, an assistant coach for the Detroit Pistons, was going over to 
Isiah Thomas's house a few days after his team won the NBA championship in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
"I only live five minutes away from him," Malone said. "He's called me up 
several times. He has a gym in his house. And I went over. We went through 
drills for about two hours. After Joe Dumars' wedding (in August) we came home 
at one o'clock in the morning . . . he shot from 2 o'clock to 3:30 in the 
morning." 
</P>
<P>
Insomnia isn't the issue here. Obsession is. Ten years and Isiah Thomas is 
still searching. There was joy on his face when the Pistons swept the Lakers 
and won their first NBA championship, but also relief. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had found the secret, what made Larry Bird and Magic Johnson able to 
rise above the competition year in and year out. What made them champions. He 
wasn't sharing. It was a decade-long quest, one that made him fiercely loyal 
admirers and bitter enemies. 
</P>
<P>
And now that he's on top, he's not sharing just how he plans to keep the 
Pistons there. They spent much of the first half of the season struggling to 
find their collective rhythm. Rick Mahorn was gone, Mark Aguirre was here, John 
Salley had to start. The bench suffered. Coach Chuck Daly has called the first 
three months of the season "a big fishing expedition." 
</P>
<P>
Now they've ridden a recent 13-game winning streak to the top of the Central 
Division and are playing better than ever. 
</P>
<P>
And Isiah Lord Thomas III is the leader of this bunch, the unquestioned soul of 
what may no longer be the Bad Boys, but simply the best basketball team in the 
league. Do the Pistons intimidate as they did last season? Probably not. Can 
you beat them four times over seven games? Same answer. 
</P>
<P>
"He's so competitive by nature," Daly said, "that I don't think he could change 
if he wanted to. But I think there is something that happens -- it's very 
subtle -- when you win it. There isn't that hard edge and there's a certain 
amount of confidence that I know I feel. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't worry about what people think as much -- writers, media, owners, big 
decisions -- you make better decisions. And I think you have more confidence in 
your players, and vice versa." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's made him more mature," said Aguirre, Thomas's long-time friend. 
"He really talks to me all the time about figuring out which direction, what 
emotion to do it again. He is in more of a philosopher-type situation, figuring 
out how to do it again. He's really into it, really into it." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas was thumbing through his mail in the spacious Pistons' locker room an 
hour before Detroit played Washington recently. On the surface, there was 
little to squeeze from the game that followed -- the Pistons led by 20 at the 
half and won by 30. 
</P>
<P>
But this is all about motivations, how to stay focused, how to keep sharp when 
you could mail it in against a bad team. That's the beauty of the defense, the 
psychology of being top dog. How do you do it? 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, it's still a learning process," Thomas said. "You have to learn 
from everything during the course of a basketball season. It's just like going 
to school. You have to progress before they let you go to the next level. The 
teacher tells you something new, and you can't go on until you more or less 
master that skill." 
</P>
<P>
His numbers are rock-solid (18.5 points per game, 9.5 assists, team-high 952 
steals), unusually low in one important area -- field-goal percentage. A career 
47 percent shooter, he is hitting just .440 this season, which if carried out 
would be his lowest percentage from the floor since his rookie season. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the pressure of being the lead guard on the defending world champions? 
</P>
<P>
"There's always pressure on me," he said. "That's always the way it's been. 
That's just part of the responsibility of being a team leader. That's just the 
way it goes . . . two and two is four." 
</P>
<P>
When Detroit fell behind a fast-breaking Chicago team at the start of the 
season, some people wondered out loud if the Pistons could sustain the effort 
to win back-to-back titles. The obvious thing was to point to the loss of 
Mahorn and the subsequent vacuum it created at power forward. 
</P>
<P>
That was a problem, but what may have dulled the Pistons' edge was the 
weariness of the chase. They had engaged themselves in a title chase in earnest 
for the better part of 36 months, and when that goal was achieved they almost 
had to take a step back. 
</P>
<P>
You're not as naive," Thomas said. "You're not the little kid on the block. 
You're more or less looked at as the team everyone else reassesses itself 
against, instead of the the Lakers and Celtics. The experiences are totally 
different. 
</P>
<P>
"When you win, you're supposed to win, you're supposed to play good. When you 
lose, it's horrible. You're not patted on the back, and you're encouraged to 
improve as a basketball team." 
</P>
<P>
But the Pistons have found their feet. They held opponents to less than 50% 
shooting in only seven of their first 31 games, then did it eight times the 
next 13. Everyone points to the Lakers game Jan. 21 as a turning point. Los 
Angeles pushed Detroit around on the Pistons' home floor and Thomas, obviously 
frustrated, was ejected in the last two minutes after hitting Mychal Thompson 
on the head. 
</P>
<P>
After that game, the Pistons moved Aguirre to the bench, where he could 
concentrate more on scoring in a sixth-man role. Dennis Rodman started, getting 
the kind of minutes he probably deserves. He would rather remain a reserve, but 
the numbers don't lie.

NBA NOTES;

<P>
THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING ON 'THE DAYS OF OUR HAWKS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HUBBARD, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When we last tuned in to "Days of Our Hawks," Coach Mike Fratello was noting 
that his team's largest problem was a "low basketball I.Q." He made the 
observation before ordering his team to miss free throws on purpose in order to 
improve its free-throw shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, life seems to always be wild and crazy with the Hawks, who are as 
unpredictable as ever. Last week, they were humiliated by the host Pacers, 
losing by 27 points. It was their 11th loss in 13 games. Afterward, Hawks guard 
John Battle said, "We don't know our roles anymore. We don't know each other." 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, two nights later, the Hawks ended the Pistons' 13-game winning 
streak with a 112-103 victory in Atlanta. Perfect. When nothing is expected, 
the Hawks are at their best. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks are led by the inconsistent but flamboyant Dominique Wilkins, whose 
presence seems to guarantee only inconsistency and flamboyance. Wilkins, as 
always, is capable of spectacular dunks and big numbers. But when is the last 
time Wilkins, who is shooting 45.7% from the field this season, had a great 
game when the Hawks beat a great team? It seems to have been a long time. 
</P>
<P>
Last week when they beat the Pistons, Wilkins had 16 points. In their victory 
over the Rockets, he had 26. Against the hapless Heat, he had 36. 
</P>
<P>
In fairness, Wilkins hasn't had a lot of consistent help, especially from Moses 
Malone, whose ups and downs have been so pronounced that he was left off the 
All-Star team for the first time in 12 years. Malone's most notable achievement 
this season, in fact, was his assertion that he was more important than 
Fratello, who is in the last year of his contract. Perhaps Moses has a second 
career in mind. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks still are without guard Doc Rivers, who has missed the last 25 games 
because of back problems. And Jon Koncak has missed 15 games after arthroscopic 
knee surgery. But both players are expected to be back in two weeks. In fact, 
for the last two or three weeks, both players have been scheduled to be back in 
two weeks. "Every time we ask," a Hawks spokesman said, "the doctors say two 
weeks." Even the Hawks doctors act like Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
Koncak, by the way, is now a Very Important Hawk. He averages only 4.0 points 
and 4.5 rebounds, but, we are told, he plays great defense. The Hawks gave 
Koncak a six-year, $13.5-million contract last season, and now we know why -- 
to play defense. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks have regained the services of Battle, who missed 16 games after 
arthroscopic knee surgery. And Kenny Smith, who was acquired from the Kings for 
Antoine Carr, is continuing to learn the system. 
</P>
<P>
If the season ended now, the Hawks would be the eighth-place playoff team and 
would meet the Pistons in the first round. Perhaps they could even advance to 
seventh place and play the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
Which brings up a story. Muhammad Ali once said that one of the reasons he 
defeated Sonny Liston the first time was because he had acted so wild and crazy 
that Liston was unnerved, thinking he was getting in the ring with a lunatic. 
</P>
<P>
Any opponent who studies the Hawks' situation closely will understand Ali's 
strategy. And the scary thing is that they may understand how Liston felt, 
which is why the Hawks, if healthy, are a potentially dangerous playoff team. 
</P>
<P>
Bleak times for Cavs -- If the season ended now, the Cavaliers would not make 
the playoffs and would not have their No. 1 pick, which they sent to the 
Clippers in the Ron Harper-Danny Ferry deal. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Hawks, the Cavaliers have been hurt by injuries, losing Mark Price for 
eight games, Larry Nance for 17 and Brad Daugherty for 41. But even though they 
now are healthy, they were unable to take advantage of the home court in 
February. They played 9 of 11 games at home, but had only a 6-5 record. 
</P>
<P>
Now they are in a period in which they play 10 of 13 on the road. If they can't 
win at home, they're probably not going to win on the road. By the time they 
get back home, they may have taken another step backward. 
</P>
<P>
Mark of maturity -- Somebody must have had a serious discussion with Mark 
Jackson between Sunday and Tuesday, and he must have listened. After the Knicks 
lost to the Pistons and Jackson was booed, he said the fans didn't matter. 
After the Knicks defeated the Mavericks Tuesday, he admitted the fans' booing 
bothered him, which was another way of saying the fans did matter. Perhaps 
someone pointed out to Jackson how unwise it was to belittle the fans. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson is correct in pointing out that the fans have little patience with him, 
but there is a way to reverse that. Stay in shape, play hard, don't taunt the 
fans and don't minimize their importance. 
</P>
<P>
A rookie teacher -- Another interesting theory from San Antonio on the Rod 
Strickland-Maurice Cheeks trade: Cheeks, in part, was supposed to provide the 
veteran support to make David Robinson's transition from two years of 
inactivity to the NBA as easy as possible. The Spurs have been pleasantly 
surprised to discover, however, that maturity is one of Robinson's major 
strengths. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the veteran influence became less important. And the Spurs also 
believed that despite the questions about Strickland -- his moodiness and 
pouting and, as the Knicks said, "lack of time management" -- Robinson would 
provide such a good example for Strickland that any distractions would be 
minor. And they may be right, which, again, will say a lot about the greatness 
of David Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Bring on the Spurs -- The Mavericks had won 14 of 17 games before being 
overwhelmed by the Knicks Tuesday and the Celtics Wednesday. The Mavericks had 
hopes of catching the Spurs, but it seems unlikely. Mavericks guard Rolando 
Blackman said, however, that the Mavericks would like to play the Spurs in the 
playoffs, and the Strickland-Cheeks deal would have little effect on the 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing for us is that it doesn't matter if they have Strickland or 
Cheeks," Blackman said. "We can beat them with either player if we have our act 
together. They replaced a good player with a good player who is younger, but 
that doesn't matter to us because if we play the way we can, we can beat them." 
</P>
<P>
Around the league -- Life figures to be quite different for Pete Myers, now 
that he is a Net instead of a Knick. But the biggest difference won't be 
playing for a losing team instead of a winning one. The biggest difference will 
be that when the Knicks play the Nets at the Meadowlands, Myers will no longer 
be playing for the team that gets cheered. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics complained last year that Leonard Armato, Brian Shaw's agent, did 
not give them a chance to negotiate to keep Shaw from going to Italy. It is 
significant that Shaw recently fired Armato before signing with the Celtics, 
who said Shaw will not join the team until next season. 
</P>
<P>
The Mavericks offered the Bucks two No. 1 picks and Adrian Dantley for Ricky 
Pierce before the trading deadline, and the Bucks seemed interested. But Bucks 
owner Herb Kohl vetoed the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Jazz President Frank Layden on NBA Commissioner David Stern's five-year, 
$27.5-million contract: "The head of the Colombian cartel doesn't make that 
much money."

COUPLES TIED FOR THE LEAD AFTER SHOOTING 67 IN WIND

Fred Couples extracted a 67 from gusty winds and tied Paul Azinger for the 
second round lead Friday in the Doral Open golf tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"That's about the best I could have got out of the round," said Couples, who 
saved par and a share of the lead with an eight-foot par-putt on the final 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
Couples, seeking a second consecutive PGA Tour victory, completed two rounds on 
Doral's Blue Monster course in 134, 10 under par. 
</P>
<P>
He was tied with Azinger, who converted a good finish and a better start into a 
66, the best round of the day. 
</P>
<P>
"Fast start, fast finish," said Azinger, who opened his round 
eagle-birdie-birdie and closed it birdie-par-birdie. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Calcavecchia, playing hours ahead of Couples and Azinger in the worst of 
the winds, with gusts to 30 mph -- shot a 67 that left him one stroke off the 
lead at 135. 
</P>
<P>
"Considering the winds, I played about as well as I can," said Calcavecchia, 
winner of the British Open and two American titles last year. 
</P>
<P>
The same, however, hardly could be said of Tom Kite, the 1989 Player of the 
Year and one of golf's most consistent players. 
</P>
<P>
Kite blew to a fat 78, his first score that high since a similar score cost him 
the 1989 U.S. Open title. His 146 total was 2 over par and one more than 
required to qualify for the final two rounds Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
It marked the first time in 37 tournaments, going back to 1988, he had missed 
the cut. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Purtzer was fourth, two back of Calcavecchia, at 137. He had a 70 in the 
difficult conditions. 
</P>
<P>
John Cook and Phil Blackmar were next at 138. Each had a second-round 71. 
</P>
<P>
First-round leader Jim Gallagher went to a 74 and was at 139. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Nicklaus matched par 72 and reached the tournament halfway point at 140, 
six shots back. 
</P>
<P>
Australian Greg Norman was 73-141. PGA champion Payne Stewart and Tom Watson 
had matching scores of 73-143. 
</P>
<P>
Azinger, who has won once and has a second place finish in six previous 
tournaments this year, said his fast start "kind of caught me off guard. 
</P>
<P>
"Going to the first tee I was a little insecure about the way I was hitting 
it." 
</P>
<P>
But he needed only a 5-iron second shot to reach the green on the par-5 first 
hole.

MILAN DENIES VALVANO REPORT 
</P>

MILAN, Italy

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Valvano, under pressure to resign at North Carolina State, may be on his 
way to the Italian basketball league, a Milan sports newspaper says. The 
Italian team says: No way. 
</P>
<P>
An executive of Italian basketball champion Philips Milan on Friday denied a 
published report that the club is talking with Valvano and might sign him for 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
"The report is groundless," Tony Cappellari, general manager of Philips Milan, 
told The Associated Press on Friday. "We did not contact Valvano and do not 
immediately plan to change coaches." 
</P>
<P>
Valvano, however, did not deny the report. Contacted at the airport when he 
returned from New York to Raleigh on Friday, the coach said only: "It is best 
to concentrate on the present at this time." 
</P>
<P>
Cappellari said the disappointing performance of Philips in the Italian league 
this season has sparked a number of false reports about a coaching change. 
</P>
<P>
Latest among them is a report by Italy's largest sports daily, Gazzetta dello 
Sport of Milan, that Valvano was negotiating his transfer to Philips. The 
report appeared in Friday's paper and said the team and Valvano may be nearing 
a deal. 
</P>
<P>
The Italian newspaper said Valvano planned to bring playmaking guard Chris 
Corchiani to Italy with him. 
</P>
<P>
Valvano has come under fire at North Carolina State, which already is under 
NCAA probation and now is the target of a point-shaving investigation. With the 
faculty already calling for his resignation or firing, two of the state's 
newspapers on Friday joined the cries for Valvano's head. 
</P>
<P>
"Philips has a tradition of changing few coaches," Cappellari said. "In any 
case the decision is always taken at the end of the season, never during." 
</P>
<P>
Philips, currently coached by Franco Casalini, has struggled all season and 
won't make the playoffs.

MARYLAND REBOUNDING UNDER WILLIAMS; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: DESPITE THE THREAT OF NCAA SANCTIONS AGAINST THE PROGRAM 
AND DIFFICULT TIMES IN HIS PERSONAL LIFE, THE TERRAPINS' COACH HAS LED A 
RESURGENCE AT HIS ALMA MATER.

<TEXT>
<P>
Gary Williams emerges from the locker-room tunnel at Cole Field House, 
shoulders stooped, chin jutting, eyes straight ahead, a human Leaning Tower of 
Pisa. If you did not know him better, you would think he was about to fall on 
his face. 
</P>
<P>
It is the purposeful stride of a man in a hurry, which Williams has been since 
taking over the job of head basketball coach at his alma mater, the University 
of Maryland, in June. In a hurry to win games, in a hurry to earn back respect 
in the Atlantic Coast Conference and, most of all, in a hurry to bring life 
back to the program. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1989-90 season, Williams has been successful on all counts. The 
Terrapins, 9-20 a year ago under Bob Wade, are 18-12. Included among six 
conference victories are sweeps of North Carolina and Virginia. In the latter 
stages of the season, sellouts for ACC home games were the rule rather than the 
exception. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've accomplished a lot," Williams said. "Attitude-wise, we're 
stronger people than we were before. Maybe that's the biggest accomplishment. 
But I want to keep it going after the season is over." 
</P>
<P>
It has not been easy. In fact, Williams said recently that this has been "the 
longest year I've ever had as a head coach." This campaign marks his 10th 
winning season in the past 12 years spent at American University, Boston 
College, Ohio State and at Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
What made it even more difficult was an admitted violation by Williams of a 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. rule that prohibits coaches from watching 
their teams work out before the Oct. 15 starting date. Last month, Williams 
said that he twice watched the Terps scrimmage informally. 
</P>
<P>
It was an embarrassing blot on what has been one of Williams' best coaching 
jobs. In essence, he took a group of players with raw talent, no depth and 
little collective quickness -- perhaps the one thread that has run through each 
of his programs -- and turned it into the most improved team in the ACC. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest thing is to believe that you can be successful competing at this 
level," said Williams, who inherited a nucleus of four players from a team that 
finished 1-13 in the ACC last season. "Once you see the success, it's easier 
for you to do the things it takes to be successful. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problem was having the players accept something before they saw 
results. If I could have promised them that we would beat North Carolina twice, 
that we would win on the road at Virginia, it might have been easier (for them 
to work hard). Even when we were losing those close games to Georgia Tech, Duke 
and Clemson, the players saw how far we had come as a team." 
</P>
<P>
It is not difficult to pinpoint when the players began to understand what 
Williams was talking about, and screaming about, in practice. It did not sink 
in after they lost to South Carolina at the buzzer Dec. 1 in Richmond, Va., or 
after they were blown out by Connecticut three nights later in the ACC-Big East 
Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
It happened when the Terps lost at home to Coppin State, 70-63, on Dec. 12. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't lose that game," Maryland assistant Roger McCready said, "we're 
not the team we are today." 
</P>
<P>
During the 10 days between that loss and Maryland's next game, the players 
spent the beginning of their Christmas vacation in long, difficult practices. 
When they arrived in Hawaii for the Chaminade tournament, the Terps were a 
different team. Williams changed his lineup, moving Walt Williams from shooting 
guard to point guard, Teyon McCoy from point guard to shooting guard and Jesse 
Martin off the bench to small forward. It led to center Tony Massenburg, the 
only senior who plays regularly, taking an active leadership role. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd talk from time to time, and I understood his philosophy and what he 
expected from his players," said Massenburg, who has gone from being a 
talented, yet inconsistent player, to an all-conference candidate. "I've tried 
to be sort of his offspring on the court." 
</P>
<P>
If Massenburg is Williams' offspring, then Mike Anderson and Vince Broadnax 
have become his playing reincarnates. Neither possesses a great deal of natural 
ability, as was the case with Williams when he played at Maryland during 
1965-67. But along with freshman Evers Burns, they have helped shape the team's 
personality. 
</P>
<P>
His players have learned during the past few months that it's not always how 
the volatile Williams says things, or how loud, but it's what he is saying. 
Massenburg said what amazes him is the way Williams can seem crazed one moment 
and so focused the next. That it happens in the middle of close games, in front 
of packed, hostile crowds, only builds confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe in him," said Massenburg, who probably has benefited the most from 
this newly instilled work ethic. "He's been through these situations so many 
times, and he's a proven winner." 
</P>
<P>
Williams credits his players for helping him pull through the tough moments. 
Aside from the admitted violation, which is considered a secondary infraction, 
there have been the likely sanctions by the NCAA from Wade's three-season 
tenure, which have hung over the program since mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
On top of that, Williams has gone through a difficult year in his personal 
life. In November, he was divorced after more than 20 years of marriage. He was 
engaged recently to Victoria Chen, an attorney and television personality from 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the other things would have been the same, but the fact that you go 
through a divorce is a big thing in anyone's life," said Williams, who turns 44 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been fortunate to have Victoria be here. It's been a tough year, but I 
also feel good about the way things have gone lately. Coming in, I knew there 
were some things that had to be smoothed out. But the positive thing is that we 
can do it here. We can win the ACC. We can go to the Final Four. You like a job 
where there are no barriers to your success." 
</P>
<P>
There are obstacles. Although the Terps are in position to be considered for an 
NCAA tournament bid this season, the program has yet to hear from the NCAA 
infractions committee regarding the violations that occurred under Wade. The 
severity of the penalty will help determine how quickly Williams is able to 
rebuild. But this season was a positive step. 
</P>
<P>
And although there have been bumpy moments, the ride has been smoother than any 
in the past five seasons at Maryland. Like many of Williams' other teams, these 
Terps, for the most part, have been overachievers. The one notable exception 
earlier in the season, sophomore forward Jerrod Mustaf, recently has played his 
best stretch since coming to Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
Mustaf scored 20 points Saturday as the Terps defeated Virginia, 89-74, in the 
schools' regular-season finale.

USIU SENIORS GO OUT IN STYLE

A half hour after the U.S. International University men's basketball team had 
played one of its finest games of the season in defeating visiting Akron, 
90-77, Saturday night, a handful of stragglers and kids participating in an 
impromptu game on the floor at Golden Hall remained. 
</P>
<P>
And Steve Smith. 
</P>
<P>
As the rest of the USIU team was heading home, contemplating their season or 
careers, Smith remained on the floor, taking his last post-game hugs as a Gull. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think this day was going to come," said Smith, who played in a 
school-record 108 games in four years at USIU. "Not so soon." 
</P>
<P>
But the day came for Smith and also Demetrius Laffitte and Paul Wilson, who 
both started the past two years after transferring from community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
And as far as farewell addresses go, the trio couldn't have asked for much 
more. 
</P>
<P>
USIU, a team that had struggled more often than not this season, was facing an 
Akron team (16-12) that had the second-best record of NCAA Division I 
independents and had defeated the Gulls, 92-80, in Akron, Jan. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Feeling excited from the prolonged introductions on their final night of 
collegiate basketball, the Gulls ran out to a 9-2 lead. And the fact that USIU 
started with a driving layup by Smith, a defensive rebound by Laffitte and a 
10-foot jumper by Wilson -- the three departing seniors -- seemed appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
But the Zips scored the next 11 points and 13 of 15 to take a 15-11 lead. From 
that point, no team led by more than five points and USIU was ahead, 44-43, at 
halftime thanks to two baskets in the final minute by Kevin Bradshaw, who 
finished with 30 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls went on another run to start the second half and this time Akron had 
no answer. USIU outscored the Zips, 19-5, after Akron scored a basket to open 
the half. The run gave the Gulls a 63-50 lead and the closest Akron could get 
was, 76-68, with 4:46 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave USIU a 12-16 record, the most victories in the five years 
Coach Gary Zarecky has been coach and the most since the Gulls went 13-12 in 
1980-81 -- there only winning season as an NCAA Division I member. 
</P>
<P>
Laffitte finished the game with 24 points and 11 rebounds to conclude his 
career averaging double figures in scoring and rebounding. Wilson had 12 points 
and Smith added 13 points and 12 assists for USIU. 
</P>
<P>
While Zarecky was handing out the customary compliments to his seniors, Smith 
was surrounded by family and friends who had watched him play since his days at 
Serra High School. 
</P>
<P>
"Monday, I'll be thinking 'I've got practice at 1 p.m.,' " Smith said. "But I 
don't. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll probably go over to a friend's house tonight. Try to put my mind off this 
game. My last game."

Mike Longe and the rest of the Nebraska Wesleyan men's basketball team got an 
early dose of March Madness Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
UC San Diego Coach Tom Marshall just got mad. 
</P>
<P>
Longe scored 14 points and grabbed 17 rebounds as Wesleyan overcame a 10-point, 
first-half deficit and defeated the Tritons, 77-75, in the second round of the 
NCAA Division III tournament at Taylor Gym. 
</P>
<P>
"This is March Madness, and that was the type of game you like to play in," 
Longe said. "During our last timeout (with 44 seconds left) Coach (Todd) 
Raridon asked if we were having fun. I was." 
</P>
<P>
Raridon said he had fun during the second half despite 19 lead changes. The 
Tritons took their last lead, 67-66, with 7:30 to go. 
</P>
<P>
Wesleyan guard Lance Anderson responded with a three-point play to put the 
Plainsmen in front, 69-67. UCSD tied the game four times in the next four 
minutes, but Wesleyan took the lead for good, 77-75, with 2:02 left. Forward 
Kirk Penner scored Wesleyan's last eight points and finished with 17. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the type of game you work all year for," said Raridon, whose 22-5 
Plainsmen will play Illinois Wesleyan Friday. "Every game is big, but we're at 
the point where it's one loss and you're out." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall said he didn't enjoy the finish. The Tritons (20-7) had several 
chances to tie in the final two minutes. Guard Tim Rapp missed a pair of free 
throws with 1:44 remaining, and Gordon McNeill missed a six-foot jump shot with 
56 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
The Plainsmen ran the clock to 15 seconds, and Longe missed a 17-footer with 
two seconds showing on the shot clock. UCSD's Darvin Jackson grabbed the 
rebound and called a timeout. The Tritons tried to set up a play, but with four 
seconds left, Jackson was whistled for traveling. Wesleyan inbounded the ball, 
and Nick Orduna ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall said the Tritons tried to isolate forward Rick Batt down low for the 
last shot, and if he was not open, to reverse the ball to Rapp. Batt finished 
with 14 points and Rapp had 19. 
</P>
<P>
"But then we got called for traveling," Marshall said. "It could have been a 
good call, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall was also upset about a technical foul he received with 1:03 left in 
the first half that allowed the Plainsmen to get back into the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Tritons led 40-28 with 4:54 left in the half, but Wesleyan cut it to 40-33 
on a Kent Lightbody free throw and baskets by Matt Green and Longe. Green 
scored with 1:03 left and was fouled. Marshall went out to talk to the official 
and was whistled for the technical. 
</P>
<P>
Green missed the free throw that would have completed a three-point play, but 
Anderson hit both technical free throws and then a three-pointer to tie the 
game at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
"All I was doing was questioning whether (Green) fouled someone to get the ball 
and the official comes over and gives me the technical," he said. "I didn't 
even say anything to him yet. That really hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
Longe said the Plainsmen played better defense in the second half, which 
resulted in the victory. The Tritons' biggest lead of the second half was three 
points. Wesleyan's biggest lead was four. 
</P>
<P>
"The first 15 minutes of the game, we weren't playing hard," Longe said. "But 
after that, we picked the defense up a notch. We kept it up all during the 
second half." 
</P>
<P>
McNeill said the Plainsmen's experience showed down the stretch. This is the 
seventh consecutive year Wesleyan has been in the NCAA Division III tournament. 
The Tritons were making their first appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"It helped them because they've been there before," said McNeill, who led the 
Tritons with 23 points. "They won the game, but we're a team to watch out for. 
We want to win it all next year. We won't settle for just getting into the 
playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson scored 23 points to lead the Plainsmen, 11 of which came in the first 
half. Longe scored 10 in the opening half.

EL CAMINO CONTINUES UPSET STREAK WITH PLAYOFF VICTORY OVER CYPRESS 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CYPRESS-Just call El Camino's basketball team the "Road Warriors." For the 
third consecutive playoff game El Camino defeated a much higher-seeded team on 
the road to earn a spot in the final eight tournament on March 8-10 at UC 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the Warriors continued their playoff streak by defeating No. 2 
Cypress (28-4) 80-71 in the third round. The Chargers had nailed El Camino 
70-49 on Dec. 23. 
</P>
<P>
The upset prevented 23rd-year Cypress Coach Don Johnson from recording 501 
career victories and becoming the winningest junior college coach in the state. 
</P>
<P>
It also proved that No. 23 El Camino (23-10) can play with the big guys, even 
though seeded lower than any other South Coast Conference team. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just hungry," said El Camino Coach Ron McCurkin. "They've got to get 
something out of this season. Although I don't even want to think about it, we 
didn't win league, but now we have a chance to win something else. " 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he knew El Camino wasn't the same team that lost here in December. 
</P>
<P>
"All reports indicated that they were much more active and aggressive," he 
said. "And they were." 
</P>
<P>
Four El Camino players scored in double figures. Sophomore guard Larry Lockley 
led the pack with 23 points, and Jamal Ross and Steve Leary each added 14. 
Freshman Michael Houck (Rolling Hills High) had 12. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress was led by sophomore center Andre Lamoureux who had 23 points. Despite 
his performance, Cypress' shooting was colder than an Alaskan night in 
mid-winter. The Chargers made their first shot from the field with 16:03 left 
when Lamoureux hit an easy bank shot. Cypress shot a dismal 35% in the half. 
</P>
<P>
"They were cold," McClurkin said, "because of us, because of our defense. We 
haven't played defense like that in a long time. It was very intense." 
</P>
<P>
El Camino took advantage of Cypress' bricks by hitting the defensive boards 
hard. The Warriors also shot well at 55%. They went on an 11-point run early in 
the game to take a 21-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress narrowed the lead to nine with 1:27 left for the break, but El Camino 
took a 40-29 halftime lead after a two-handed jam by Leary and a base line 
jumper by Lockley in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress narrowed the lead to eight with 12:26 left to play. With 7:09 
remaining, Grayle Humphrey swiped the ball from El Camino's Allen Caveness and 
passed it to Mike Renaud, who hit a 17-footer that brought the Chargers to 
within five points, 53-58. 
</P>
<P>
A pair of Lamoureux free throws brought the Chargers to within four with 5:09 
left, but that's as close as they got.

LOYOLA LACROSSE TEAM STICKS TO ITS GOALS;

CLUB SPORTS: THANKS TO HARD WORK BY THE COACH AND PLAYERS, THIS WEST COAST CLUB 
IS BECOMING COMPETITIVE IN A SPORT DOMINATED BY EAST COAST TEAMS.

<P>
Lacrosse, you've come a long way baby. First an ancient American Indian sport 
and then an Ivy League college favorite, it has finally made it to Loyola 
Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
Now a club sport at Loyola, it took the determination of Coach Dave Basile and 
the dedication of the players to build a credible lacrosse team. 
</P>
<P>
Becoming competitive has been the major goal for Basile since he took over the 
team three years ago. The team was actually created four years ago but played 
without a coach for its first season. 
</P>
<P>
To become competitive it needed a coach. So Basile, first entering the scene as 
a referee for several of their games, decided to take on the job. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was just a club sport, but I really wanted to get actively back into 
lacrosse," said Basile, a Philadelphia native who teaches at Bishop Montgomery 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
For the first two years, Basile says, he did everything that he could to keep 
the team going. He located competition and set up matches. He taught the 
players the fundamentals. Now that the team has been established, he finally 
has some help in the form of four assistants with experience in the East. 
</P>
<P>
Club teams in California compete in the West Coast Lacrosse League and are 
divided into a North and South Division. These are further divided into 
Divisions 1 and 2. Loyola plays in Southern Division 2. The league spans the 
state, with teams in the San Francisco area, Chico and Humboldt and San Diego. 
Arizona and Arizona State are also included. 
</P>
<P>
The best collegiate teams traditionally are on the East Coast. Teams like 
two-time defending NCAA champ Syracuse, Johns Hopkins, Maryland and the 
Carolina schools have dominated the scene in the United States. Much of that 
has to do with the level of attention given to the sport in that area. There 
are high school programs and summer leagues. It is a high profile sport in 
parts of the East. 
</P>
<P>
In California, Basile said the best programs are at Whittier College and Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are the most competitive in California, but they still aren't anywhere 
near the level of Syracuse," Basile said. Loyola beat San Jose State last 
weekend to improve to 3-4 going into Sunday's 1 p.m. home game against the 
University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Lacrosse is a sport some would consider violent. The safety equipment consists 
of leg pads, padded gloves and a helmet. The only equipment the game itself 
needs is a pole with a triangular net at the end, a soccer-sized field, two 
goal nets and a hard rubber ball about the size of a tennis ball. 
</P>
<P>
Players try to score goals by throwing a ball past a goalie. The ball cannot be 
touched by the player's hands and must be handled with the stick. Defenders 
check opponents hockey-style and also slash at the ball with their sticks. 
</P>
<P>
Organization is the key to the game, according to Basile. The players must know 
what kind of defense and offense is most effective and that, he says, is his 
job. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Loyola's players are athletes from California high schools who had 
never played lacrosse. This means that teaching the fundamentals of the game is 
the most important aspect of practice. 
</P>
<P>
When the Loyola team started, Basile said, it had only 17 "dedicated players" 
who showed up for every game, but the roster has grown to 35. Basile's goal is 
to have 45 players so that a full-time junior varsity can be created. The 
second team now only plays when it is certain that everyone is going to be 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Getting players can be tricky business in club sports, as there is no money to 
offer scholarships. There is also very little attention garnered from playing 
on the West Coast when all of the best teams are in the East. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't really recruit anyone," Basile said. "The only thing that I can do is 
offer up (California), the good-looking women and the college as inducements to 
play here. Mainly I offer the players a change from playing in the cold."

Brian Beaman scored on a header with 3:53 left in overtime and Laguna Hills 
High School hung on to upset Orange, 2-1, and win the Southern Section 2-A 
boys' soccer championship Saturday at Gahr High School. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Orange had defeated its Pacific Coast League rival in all three 
matches this season, but Saturday night's match belonged to Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what we wanted all season," Laguna Hills Coach Scott Johnson. "And 
what a beautiful goal to win it on." 
</P>
<P>
Halfback Scott Clark set up Beaman with a perfect pass, sending a left-footed 
shot near the right goal post, just five yards in front of Orange goalie Tres 
Martin. 
</P>
<P>
"Scotty got loose and ran a breaker to the outside," Beaman said, "and I was 
supposed to head for the far post." 
</P>
<P>
After blowing past the Orange fullbacks, Beaman knocked his header just inside 
the right post to beat a diving Martin. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'll never forget that moment," Beaman said. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills might not have reached that moment if Johnson had followed his 
initial reaction and pulled halfback Eric Davis midway through the second half. 
</P>
<P>
With the Hawks trailing, 1-0, Johnson decided to leave Davis in the game after 
he had collided with a group of players. Davis made good on his coach's 
decision by scoring the typing goal on a scramble in front of the Panthers' net 
at the 63 minute mark. 
</P>
<P>
"I was all set to take him out, but look what he did," Johnson said. "I think 
we're all glad he stayed out there." Johnson tried to inspire his players at 
halftime by telling them the next team that scored would probably win. 
</P>
<P>
"Eric's was a pivotal goal," he said. "In the first half we were waiting for 
things to happen, but we've been trailing 1-0 at the half a number of times in 
the playoffs, so it wasn't anything unusual for us." Orange's first half goal 
came from Ricky Heimer, who headed in a corner kick for his sixth goal of the 
playoffs and 18th of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"We hit a dry spell in the first part of the second half," Orange Coach Ed 
Carillo said. "But we came back hard. We just attacked in the overtime because 
we didn't want to tie, and both teams played really hard." MICHAEL ITAGAKI

THE DOMINICAN EXPERIENCE: THERE'S NOTHING QUITE LIKE IT; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: FOR INTENSITY AND SHEER LOVE OF THE GAME, IT'S HARD TO BEAT PLAYERS 
AND FANS ON THIS ISLAND.

SAN PEDRO DE MACORIS, Dominican Republic 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The irresistible logic of 10-year-old Jose Manuel ends the debate among the 
boys hanging out at Estadio Tetelo Varga -- San Pedro's baseball stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The noisy discussion was prompted by a Norteamericano's question: Which is more 
important, school or baseball? As the stadium's corrugated roof clatters in the 
late afternoon breeze, most of the youngsters shout "pelota" -- "ball" in 
Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
But Jose has a better answer. 
</P>
<P>
"School is important because there you learn to write," he says. "Then when it 
comes time to sign with a team, I can write my name." 
</P>
<P>
To understand that this painfully skinny, barefoot kid sees the inevitability 
of baseball in his future is to offer some explanation of the baseball madness 
that pervades everyday life in this poor Caribbean country. 
</P>
<P>
Everywhere there are signs of the national obsession: Boys play with sticks and 
homemade balls in Santo Domingo's barrios; teen-agers execute flawless double 
plays on sugar mill diamonds groomed by wandering cows; the countryside is 
dotted with baseball "academies" where young men spend days in Dodgers, Astros 
and Blue Jays mufti learning curveballs and English, their nights in barracks, 
dreaming of the big league. 
</P>
<P>
Other countries may have lots of sports, but here there is only one -- pelota. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing we know how to do is play baseball," says Juan Samuel of the 
Los Angeles Dodgers, who grew up on a dirt street near San Pedro's stadium. 
"The kids in the states can go to school and have a nice life. Here, baseball 
is your only chance." 
</P>
<P>
There is reason for Jose to believe in that chance at El Grande Carpa -- the 
Big Show. Seventy-seven Dominicans were in the majors last year, at least 18 
from this sugar mill city; stars like Samuel, George Bell, Alfredo Griffin and 
Tony Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
Such players are national heroes. Dodger veteran Manny Mota, a senior statesman 
of Dominican ball, is called by reporters to comment on perestroika. He grills 
presidential candidates on their sports backgrounds during his weekly 
television show. 
</P>
<P>
"They are nervous, not me," he says with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
But the intensity of baseball, so appreciated here, is sometimes considered 
strange in the states. Joaquin Andujar, ejected from a 1985 World Series game 
for charging an umpire, was said to have later demolished a clubhouse toilet 
with a bat. Bell, the 1987 American League MVP, staged an outfield sit-in when 
demoted to designated hitter. Pascual Perez, who missed a pitching start by 
getting lost on the way to Atlanta's stadium, threw a ball into the Cubs dugout 
last year after he was hit by a line drive. "That's Perez," said Montreal 
Manager Buck Rodgers. "Never a dull minute." 
</P>
<P>
"We all want to win," says Mariano Duncan, a former Dodger now with Cincinnati. 
"We take baseball seriously. Here we take it deep inside." 
</P>
<P>
Here baseball is more than a sport. It is a socio-economic force that resounds 
throughout the island. The "bolas" and strikes are familiar to Norteamericanos, 
but much of what happens on and off field is part of a unique culture. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely different down here," says Greg Biagini, manager of the 
Orioles' Rochester club, who skippered the San Pedro Estrellas in this year's 
Dominican Winter League. "On opening night, I killed a cow on my way home." 
Biagini notes the season record is two cows, then pauses. 
</P>
<P>
"At least that's this team's record," he says as clarification. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DOMINICAN MYSTIQUE 
</P>
<P>
If a city the size of Muncie, Ind., began producing a steady stream of star 
infielders, you'd expect a mob of scouts to rush town square. 
</P>
<P>
That's what has happened in San Pedro and in the country itself. Dozens of 
scouts, including some from Japan, range the island for talent. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, just a few clubs had scouts. Now everyone is looking," says Manny 
Lantigua, a San Diego Padres scout. "Now you have to look harder." 
</P>
<P>
Theories are many to explain why baseball, introduced here by occupying U.S. 
forces early in the century, is better in the Dominican. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Genetics. The wisdom is Dominicans are smaller, wirier, quicker: a natural 
edge for infielders. The truth is Dominicans -- like every nationality -- come 
in all sizes, from 6-foot-2 Gilberto Reyes, a Montreal catcher, to Pittsburgh 
infielder Rafael Belliard, a 5-foot-6 veteran with slightly Oriental features. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm Chinese," he claims, further confusing the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Because a glove and bat cost an average month's wages, kids use tree branch 
bats, gloves fashioned from milk cartons, balls of stuffed socks and 
occasionally limes. The field may be a street or an ill-kept diamond. These 
disadvantages, the wisdom goes, build skill and character. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can play shortstop on our field, you deserve to be in the big leagues," 
Biagini said. "The ball takes hops that are unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Another wisdom says Dominicans excel because they play all the time. Here 
baseball weather reigns year-round. The sugar mills that provide employment and 
social structure also provide equipment and fields. There are little leagues, 
sugar leagues, factory leagues, even police leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"All the sugar mills have some program to keep the people doing something in 
the dead times," says Ralph Avila, head of the Dodgers' Latin American program. 
"The only thing they can do is go to the field and play ball." 
</P>
<P>
There is also the matter of Dominican spirit. "They don't quit. They don't give 
up if things are going bad," says Karl Kuehl, director of player development at 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
But while Dominicans may be outstanding athletes, U.S. clubs find them lacking 
in the area of baseball strategy and tactics. 
</P>
<P>
"They can run, throw and hit; their natural skills are great. But their 
knowledge of structure isn't worth a damn," Kuehl said. 
</P>
<P>
That is why Oakland is joining the score of U.S. clubs with training facilities 
here to prepare Dominicans for big league ball. Among them is Las Palmas, the 
Dodger's 50-acre academy, a kind of sports prep school with barracks for 40, 
satellite dishes, computers, videotaped instruction, a Manny Mota Field and a 
Tommy Lasorda Dining Room. 
</P>
<P>
Here recruits are fed in quality and quantity above island standards. They get 
medical treatment, lessons in English, Spanish and American culture. One 
classroom has a blackboard lesson on placing a telephone call and posters 
showing the best place, statistically, to swing in the strike zone. 
</P>
<P>
Understandably, Las Palmas is as sought after as Harvard. More than 9,000 have 
tried out there; some are invited, some walked miles to plead their case at the 
gate. Most of those accepted are released after 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
"Many times the parents will come to the gate and beg us to take their son 
back," Avila said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
EL FANATICO 
</P>
<P>
The Roman "fanaticus" (meaning "of the temple") is the common root, but the 
Spanish and English derivations go a long way in describing the difference 
between American "fans" and Dominican "fanaticos." 
</P>
<P>
Stories about Dominican fanaticos are legend: Players have been pelted with 
rocks; near riots suppressed by troops with submachineguns. 
</P>
<P>
"The fans here are crazier," says Dodger pitcher John Wetteland. "It's not 
unusual to have a couple fights break out during a game." 
</P>
<P>
Dominicans have mellowed a bit, but watching a Dominican League game from the 
stands is not for the faint-hearted. 
</P>
<P>
The difference is evident as you make your way through street venders selling 
peeled oranges and boiled corn. Fanaticos are frisked at the turnstiles by 
national police in battered riot helmets. While some American stadiums check 
for booze, the search here is for guns and knives. Pints of raw-tasting 
80-proof rum sold in and out of the stadium are ignored. 
</P>
<P>
There is entertainment other than baseball. A fire-eater performs on the roof 
of a dugout. A man in a purple top hat stalks the aisles doing magic tricks. 
Between innings, the stadium echoes with merengue music, often performed by a 
live band. Fans, players, even police tapping nightsticks, sway to the beat. 
</P>
<P>
The stands also buzz with wagering. Bets are laid down constantly, on the game, 
the inning, the at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll bet on whether the batter will take the next pitch," said Dave 
Wallace, a Dodger pitching coach. 
</P>
<P>
Be it the rum or wagers, the crowd can get, well, intense. During a game 
between the Santo Domingo Licey and Estrellas, a confused play has three San 
Pedro runners converging on third base. One bolts for home, smashing into the 
Licey pitcher covering the rundown and carries him across home plate. 
</P>
<P>
The fanaticos yell and gesture. A haymaker is thrown, snapping back someone's 
head. A few rows back, a heated discussion ends when a man smashes his bottle 
of El Presidente beer across a chair. Someone shouts: "Your pitchers are too 
skinny!" 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of major league players don't like it here," Duncan explains. "The fans 
are louder." 
</P>
<P>
Outside the stadium, passions also run high. A wizened old man waving a bat 
faces off with a drunken younger man holding a machete as long as his arm. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll cut off your head, little man," he yells. 
</P>
<P>
The old man smiles and takes practice swings as a crowd yells encouragements. 
</P>
<P>
"I might be little," he said, "but I can still hit the ball beautifully." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TOUGH ENOUGH 
</P>
<P>
"Tough" and "neat" are words that pop up often in George Bell's conversation. 
</P>
<P>
It was tough growing up in a five-room house with four siblings in Santa Fe, 
one of the sugar mill towns that ring San Pedro. It was neat playing baseball 
with homemade equipment at age 5. It was tough playing with older kids who 
whacked him for missing a play, but it was neat trying to be the best. It was 
tough, at age 17, to break into U.S. ball at Helena, Mont., a place he only 
knew of from comic book Westerns. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden I was there looking, for gunfighters," he says. "It was neat." 
</P>
<P>
Not all neat. Bell remembers living on convenience store candy because he 
couldn't speak English. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know what to order," he says. "I would have money in my pocket and I 
would be hungry, but I didn't know what to get." 
</P>
<P>
Some of that has changed. English lessons are now part of the daily regimen. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started language was a big problem," says Manny Acta, an outfielder 
with the Astros' Columbus, Ga., minor league club. "If you didn't understand a 
coach, he didn't say 'He doesn't speak English.' He said 'This guy is stupid.' 
</P>
<P>
"Now every rookie team has a Spanish speaker and they pay for English school." 
</P>
<P>
Bell sees this as an improvement, but wonders about the Americanization of 
Dominican ball. He sees computers and video tapes taking something from the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"The coaches and instructors are trying to do everything in high tech, but a 
computer is not going to help," he says. "Baseball is a different sport. You 
play on instinct." 
</P>
<P>
Bell's observations came on a sunny Sunday in the yard of his home as passersby 
on the busy San Pedro street wave and shout "Jorge." The Bell manse includes 
several buildings, a satellite dish and a pond stocked with wooden ducks. The 
bridge over the pond is dusted with the fine sugar mill grit that covers 
everything here. 
</P>
<P>
Down the street, past an empty lot where pigs root garbage piles, is Andujar's 
home and construction company that employs 200 people. Alfredo Griffin's home 
is next door. 
</P>
<P>
All the players are immensely popular. Andujar is known to approach young 
players, distribute equipment and give a half hour of instruction. Bell is a 
favorite among the local kids for doing similar kindnesses. He and Griffin also 
distribute food and fund orphanages. 
</P>
<P>
Bell shrugs this off. "It is better when people don't know," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Not all Dominican players are success stories. Many never make it beyond the 
farm clubs. One of Bell's brothers drives a New York taxi; Samuel's brother 
works in a New Jersey factory. 
</P>
<P>
"Seventy percent of the kids who get released stay in the states," Samuel said. 
"A lot get into drugs. Your friends there will get you in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
But risk of failure in the land of the Norteamericanos can't blunt the dreams 
of riches and baseball glory in young players like Franklin Lorenzo, an 
18-year-old catcher from Haina. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo looks bored when asked about the uncertainties he faces. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't worry," he said. "I know how to play ball."

MATER DEI SHUTS OUT SANTA BARBARA

The Mater Dei High School girls' soccer team accomplished plenty on Saturday 
with its 2-0 victory over Santa Barbara for the 3-A championship at Gahr High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
* The Monarchs gave the school its first Southern Section title in a girls' 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
* They gave a proper send-off to Marty Breen, who announced Saturday that he 
will step down as head coach after 11 years at Mater Dei, the past four as the 
girls' coach. 
</P>
<P>
* They set a school record for shutouts in a season -- 20 -- which ties Agoura 
as the second-best mark in Southern Section history; Laguna Hills recorded 23 
in 1986-87. 
</P>
<P>
But what really seemed to make the Monarchs' day was a quick, postgame 
announcement by Breen. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, everyone is to meet Monday at 3 p.m. at Mater Dei," he said. "I'll need 
you to turn in your uniforms . . . but you can keep the sweats." 
</P>
<P>
Judging by the players' reaction -- a near-deafening team scream -- the sweats 
must be as important as the championship plaque that they took turns holding. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't feel any better," Kari Marshall said. "No way could you ever have a 
better ending to your senior year than this." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's match seemed over after the first half, if not sooner. The Monarchs 
(23-2-2) dominated Santa Barbara in nearly every aspect of the game, and got 
goals from Susan Steiner and Robyn Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei outshot Santa Barbara, 8-2, in the first half and 15-7 for the game. 
</P>
<P>
"When you come into (the Southern Section title game), you hear all this hype 
about the team you're going to play," said Camarillo, who assisted on Steiner's 
goal. "I think when we got out there, it was kind of a letdown." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Monarchs said that the intensity of Saturday's match did not 
compare to their semifinal match Tuesday against Canyon. Mater Dei won that 
game, 1-0, in sudden-death overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, we came here expecting the best," Marshall said. "We're kind of glad it 
turned out this way, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara (24-2-2), which lost just one game in the regular season -- to 
Thousand Oaks -- seemed to have trouble keeping any momentum going. In contrast 
to Mater Dei's excellent passing and trapping skills, the Dons utilized a 
long-passing approach. It didn't get them very far, not with the Monarchs' 
stellar defense. 
</P>
<P>
"They were pretty much the most aggressive team we've played this year," Santa 
Barbara's Maria Guerrero said.

CCAA COACHES OPPOSE THEIR FRIDAY-SATURDAY SCHEDULES, POLL SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By an overwhelming margin, the men's and women's basketball coaches of the 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. favor a return to a Thursday-Saturday 
basketball schedule next season, a Times poll shows. 
</P>
<P>
The conference, which includes Cal State Dominguez Hills in Carson, played 
Friday-Saturday contests this season, except for women's games played on 
Thursdays at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. The change had been spurred by a vote of 
the conference's college presidents, who expressed concern that basketball 
players were missing too many classes on travel days. Previously, most contests 
in the eight-school league were held on Thursdays and Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
Ten coaches from the 13 men's and women's teams returning to the CCAA next 
season said that students did not suffer severe loss of class time with a 
Thursday-Saturday schedule because most road trips did not involve overnight 
stays. Several also charged that administrators at Cal State Bakersfield and 
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo had duped the presidents into voting for a travel 
schedule that served to enhance the home court advantage of the CCAA's two 
northernmost schools. 
</P>
<P>
Those in favor of Thursday-Saturday contests said the presidents were not aware 
of all the facts when they voted last spring. They cited the hazards of a lack 
of preparation time for Saturday opponents and the increased risk of injuries 
inherent in back-to-back games. The coaches also noted a drop in the quality of 
performances in Saturday games because athletes do not have a day off to 
recover, and they complained of the emotional strain on young players and an 
unfair advantage to home teams because they do not travel. 
</P>
<P>
Friday games also present increased competition for space in the local 
newspapers and media outlets. Friday night is traditionally prep night, when 
local high school games are the primary focus of coverage by local media. In 
addition, Saturday editions are traditionally some of the smallest sections of 
the week, which leaves little space for college games in some towns. 
</P>
<P>
Both Chapman College in Orange and Cal State Dominguez Hills experienced more 
than a 50% drop in media coverage this year as a result of playing Friday 
games. UC Riverside officials said they also noticed a drop in coverage. 
</P>
<P>
The Division II CCAA consists of Dominguez Hills, San Luis Obispo, Cal Poly 
Pomona, Chapman, Riverside, Cal State Los Angeles, Bakersfield and Cal State 
Northridge, which will leave the conference this fall to move to Division I. 
Bakersfield does not have a women's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
Conference coaches and some athletic administrators have charged that San Luis 
Obispo President Warren J. Baker used an emotional plea of lost class time to 
unfairly influence the other conference presidents. Coaches also complained 
that the sport of basketball is being unfairly singled out, saying athletes in 
sports such as baseball and track miss much more class time. 
</P>
<P>
(The Times survey indicates that officials at only San Luis Obispo unanimously 
favor Friday-Saturday games. Coach Pat Douglass of CCAA champion Cal State 
Bakersfield said he would support Thursday-Saturday games next year, although 
he felt back-to-back weekend contests spur more fan interest.) 
</P>
<P>
Baker reportedly used a fax machine to lobby fellow presidents. Ironically, San 
Luis Obispo's basketball teams made just three CCAA overnight road trips this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Both Baker and Mustang Athletic Director Ken Walker were out of town and 
unavailable for comment, but Associate Athletic Director Marilyn McNeil 
confirmed that the college has long been "against having to play 
Thursday-Saturday games." 
</P>
<P>
In the Times survey, the 13 returning coaches were asked: "Given a choice for 
the 1990-91 (season), on which days would you prefer to play your games?" Only 
men's Coach Steve Beeson and women's Coach Jill Orrock of San Luis Obispo 
wanted to play Friday-Saturday games, citing missed class time. 
</P>
<P>
Said Beeson: "For us, every trip is an overnight trip; it takes away from 
classes." 
</P>
<P>
Women's programs at other conference members have their own travel problems, 
however. Because San Luis Obispo played all of its women's home games on 
Thursdays and Saturdays this fall, the other six women's teams in the 
conference had to drive an average of 3 1/2 hours from the Los Angeles area on 
the afternoon of a night game, or leave a day early, thereby causing players to 
miss classes. 
</P>
<P>
Most vehemently opposed to the Friday-Saturday setup was UC Riverside Coach 
John Masi, who called the presidents' decision "bogus." He said the presidents 
were not made aware of all the ramifications of their vote. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way you can ask these players to play on back-to-back nights and 
have them be successful," said Masi, the most victorious coach in CCAA history. 
"Friday should be a rest day. Just about every conference in the country does 
it." 
</P>
<P>
In a memo written by Pomona basketball coaches Dave Bolwinkel and Darlene May 
and sent to McNeil of San Luis Obispo and the CCAA scheduling committee, the 
pair said a day of rest between games lessens the chance for injury and 
improves the quality of games. 
</P>
<P>
"The effort level has not been what it has been in the past," Bolwinkel, a 
third-year coach, told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
First-year Coach Bob Boyd of Chapman said back-to-back road games put L.A.-area 
teams at a disadvantage when traveling to play at Bakersfield and San Luis 
Obispo. To save on travel expenses, teams from L.A., such as Dominguez Hills, 
have always played at the two northernmost schools in the CCAA in a single road 
trip. That is expected to change temporarily next season, with the exit of 
Northridge, but may return in 1991-92 season when the CCAA adds Cal State San 
Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
Third-year Coach Henry Dyer of Cal State L.A. says basketball has been singled 
out because of its popularity with fans. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an overkill on the visible sports. (The presidents allow) baseball to 
play 63 games a year and track and field to go to Europe for three weeks, but 
they don't want us to go from here to Bakersfield." 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills Coach Dave Yanai, a 13-year veteran of the conference who was 
recently appointed to be the assistant coach for the West team in this summer's 
Olympic Festival, said a good compromise would be playing on Friday nights and 
Sunday afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting in Pomona Thursday in conjunction with the annual CCAA postseason 
tournament, the women's coaching group voted to return to a Thursday-Saturday 
schedule next year. The men's coaches, meeting in Bakersfield at the men's 
finals, are expected to follow suit. The recommendation will then be forwarded 
to the CCAA Executive Committee.

REBOUNDING KEYS LIONS' WIN IN WCC TOURNAMENT OPENER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
For much of the season, the Loyola Marymount basketball team has won despite 
some startling rebounding deficits. 
</P>
<P>
But in the opening round of the West Coast Conference Tournament on Saturday at 
Gersten Pavilion, the Lions were the bullies on the boards, and it resulted in 
an easy 121-84 victory over Gonzaga. 
</P>
<P>
In advancing to today's semifinals starting at 5, the Lions set a tournament 
record for rebounds with 66. Despite an off night shooting from outside, the 
Lions got 27 offensive rebounds to dominate inside. 
</P>
<P>
Lions forward Per Stumer led both teams with 12 rebounds, and Hank Gathers and 
Bo Kimble got 11 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Coach Paul Westhead noted afterward: "The insurance policy we can take 
out on advancing is to be committed to the boards. We have not been that strong 
in that area, and this was a new dimension for us." 
</P>
<P>
Gathers, who led the nation in rebounding last season and is among the leaders 
again, said that at practice Friday, "Coach told everybody when I'm rebounding 
strong, everyone usually follows me. So if we're not rebounding, it's usually 
my fault. This is bread-and-butter time, so I knew we'd come out strong." 
</P>
<P>
The Lions jumped out to a quick 27-11 lead, hit a lull as Gonzaga pulled to 
within 10, then put the game away with a 12-0 run. Despite hitting only one of 
nine three-point attempts in the first half, Loyola still had a 59-33 halftime 
lead thanks to a 35-20 rebounding edge and 17 turnovers forced by Loyola's 
active press. The final total of 121 was another tournament record. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola shot 50% for the game, while Gonzaga managed only 43%. Gonzaga Coach Dan 
Fitzgerald said, "We really turned it over; we didn't handle (the press) well 
at all. To have a chance, you have to hit a lot of good shots against them and 
we did not."

LMU'S SCOTT GETS TWO WINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART MATTHEWS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the shadows grow long on afternoon double-headers, Loyola Marymount Coach 
Chris Smith looks at his pitching corps and sees a thin red line. So far this 
season, Smith has lost starting pitchers to injury (Brian Walker) and 
ineligibility (Mike McNary). 
</P>
<P>
So it makes Smith especially happy when he sees Darryl Scott still sitting at 
the end of his bench. 
</P>
<P>
Smith called Scott's name twice Saturday afternoon, and the senior right-hander 
responded with victories in both ends of Loyola's West Coast Conference sweep 
of visiting University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Twice in double-headers this season, Smith has looked at All-American catcher 
Miah Bradbury as a temporary pitching solution. Bradbury hasn't been scored 
upon this season, but that doesn't mean Smith likes having to use him. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Bradbury had to come out from behind the plate to work an 
inning-and-a-third of relief behind starter Joe Caruso and reliever Chris 
Spears. 
</P>
<P>
But when Bradbury got into trouble in a 5-5 tie in the first game, Smith turned 
to Scott, who pitched an inning-and-two-thirds of scoreless relief to get the 
win in the opener. Loyola won, 6-5, when freshman shortstop Chris Gomez singled 
Scott home from third base with two outs in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
A half-hour later, Scott (now 3-1) was back on the mound. He scattered eight 
hits and struck out five in a 4-3 complete-game win. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday afternoon, Loyola backed Scott with some clutch defense. The Lions 
turned six double plays on the day. And Loyola (11-6 overall, 6-2 in conference 
play) also got just enough timely hitting to get the job done.

LA QUINTA OUTGUNS WEST TORRANCE IN GIRLS FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSSELL ANDREWS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Billed as a duel between West Torrance High's back court dynamo Rosa Olloque 
and La Quinta's 6-foot-2 scoring sensation Amy Jalewalia, Friday night's 
Southern Section 4-A girls basketball final was decided more by the supporting 
casts. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta walked away with the championship at Cal Poly Pomona, 72-62, led by 
Jalewalia's 32 points, but it was senior forward Heather Brannan who proved to 
be the difference, powering her way to 25 points and 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
For West, the strategy remained the same as it has been all year: Get the ball 
to Olloque. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy has been particularly difficult for opponents to stop because 
Olloque, the point guard, brings the ball up court. In the first half, Olloque 
outscored Jalewalia, who averaged a section-leading 34.3 points per game, 
16-15, and the Warriors were still within reach at halftime, 32-28. 
</P>
<P>
But the Lady Aztecs were simply too strong for West inside, out-rebounding the 
Warriors, 31-24, in the second half, as Brannan and Jalewalia took over. 
</P>
<P>
West Coach Kevin McManus, who guided the Warriors to their first CIF 
championship game appearance, admitted that West had lost to a better team. 
</P>
<P>
"They are a great team," he said. "One player shouldn't win a game. It's the 
other people that made us come out of double-teamming her." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, it has been a good season for West and Olloque, and it may not be 
over. The Warriors have a chance of being selected to compete in the State 
Division II regionals. 
</P>
<P>
But that didn't stop Olloque from shedding a few tears after the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Rosa was crying," McManus said. "But she was expecting to win a championship 
and be vindicated. She's a real star in this game, and she doesn't get much 
credit." 
</P>
<P>
After holding Jalewalia to five points in the second quarter, West saw Olloque 
held to only two in the third quarter, when La Quinta's lead ballooned to 10. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta Coach Kevin Kiernan said that guards with Olloque's penetration 
skills have caused his team problems all season, and a change of defensive 
strategy at halftime was responsible for the decisive third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to forget about pressing and get back into our normal defense," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
West was outscored, 17-10, in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the third quarter won the game," McManus said. "I guess I didn't 
make a very good locker room speech at halftime. We weren't ready when we came 
out, or they were more ready than we were." 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, the Warriors seemed to take the floor with renewed 
intensity, making it clear that if they were going to go, at least they weren't 
going quietly. Olloque matched Jalewalia basket for basket, scoring nine of her 
24 points in the final period. 
</P>
<P>
"That girl did a great job," Kiernan said. "They're a good team. You don't get 
this far without being a really good team. They worked hard and they came back. 
We had them down by 13 and they kept coming back." 
</P>
<P>
McManus said that this team's closeness and ability to work together have set 
it apart from the other girls teams he has coached in 10 years at West. 
</P>
<P>
"Rosa's skills are tremendous," he said. "But the ability of the other players 
to mold themselves around her skills has been the real key to it. Mary 
Litzenberg is a competitive athlete and a proud person and she has been able to 
mold her skills around Rosa. They are completely opposite personalities, but 
they work great together."

George Saldana's pinch-hit RBI single in the eighth inning gave Rancho Santiago 
College a 4-3 victory over Orange Coast in an Orange Empire Conference baseball 
game Saturday at OCC. 
</P>
<P>
Saldana's two-out single to right scored Jeff White, who had opened the inning 
with a single and went to second on a balk. 
</P>
<P>
OCC had two on and two outs in the ninth when reliever Rob Nay got pinch-hitter 
Mike Burns to ground out to end the game. It was Nay's first save. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago (14-2, 4-0) built a 3-1 lead with two runs in the fourth and 
Marty Neff's solo home run in the fifth. It was Neff's 10th home run of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
OCC tied it with two runs in the seventh on an RBI triple by Sean Therien and 
an RBI single by Kevin Schula. 
</P>
<P>
Winning pitcher Matt Lackie (4-1) allowed six hits and had eight strikeouts. 
Loser Tom Irwin (3-1) allowed 11 hits in nine innings for OCC (8-8, 1-2). STEVE

IT'S NOT OVER UNTIL IT'S OVER, BUT IT'S ALSO PRETTY SAD

<P>
Professional athletes die twice. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so," says Lee Lacy. "When you are told the only life you know and love is 
over, it's the same as telling you you are dead and gone." 
</P>
<P>
For 16 years Lee Lacy ran and threw and slid with joyful abandon on three major 
league baseball teams. Today, at 41, he retains his athlete's physique but has 
gained, or so he says, a middle-age maturity. Even so, he refuses to accept a 
death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Few athletes ever do. Especially, perhaps, prizefighters, whose overdue 
decisions to hang 'em up often is only slightly less painful to faithful fans 
who avert their eyes in sorrow at the ultimate ignominy. 
</P>
<P>
But denial extends to less brutal pursuits as well. Arthur Ashe, the former 
tennis champion offers an explanation and insists that "a little like dying" is 
more than metaphor. 
</P>
<P>
"We have defined our masculinity in terms of our athletic prowess," he once 
wrote, "and retirement can only mean we are thereafter lesser men." 
</P>
<P>
Lesser men. At an age that most adults consider the prime of life. 
</P>
<P>
Laying aside the artifacts of their prowess, their spikes and gloves and 
rackets, is not all they leave behind. Athletes have taken over from cowboys 
and movie stars and even astronauts as America's most glamorous heroes, 
certainly the highest paid. What they leave is more than a game, and the 
leaving thus more painful than for mere mortals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the nature of the adulation," football star Jim Brown recently told an 
interviewer. "It's so overwhelming, the thrill you get, the cheers you hear, 
the lifestyle you can afford. Your head gets bigger without your even realizing 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The years seem to pass without their realizing it as well. Many athletes, 
notably those who play team sports, argue that their ability to go just one 
more inning should determine their longevity, not the presence of some younger 
hotshot on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should there be a cutoff date?" asks Toby Harrah, whose 17-year baseball 
career included four all-star games. 
</P>
<P>
Harrah, lithe and leather tough at 42, recalls the words of Satchel Paige, 
whose playing days, some guessed, stretched into his 60s: "How can you tell how 
old you are if you don't know?" 
</P>
<P>
"You have to remember," said Harrah, "that our careers began not when we got 
out of college or even high school but back when we were 6 or 7 years old. So 
when you're told you're through while you still feel fit and confident, it's 
like being hit by a train." 
</P>
<P>
Toby Harrah and Lee Lacy are two among 200 other former major league baseball 
players who also had once been pronounced dead on arrival -- at spring training 
camp, as in Lacy's case, or when they came up with a bum leg or a sore arm or a 
slow bat. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, none of them accepted the verdict as final. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, all of them heeded a siren's song inviting former major leaguers 35 
and older to come to Florida, land of the Fountain of Youth, and play baseball 
once again, this time in the Senior Professional Baseball Association. 
</P>
<P>
The league, its first three-month winter season just ended, was the brainstorm 
of an entrepreneur willing to bet, as were his aging recruits, on baseball 
philosopher Yogi Berra's pronouncement that the game ain't over 'til it's over. 
</P>
<P>
Like Harrah, Lacy insists that "that's something a ballplayer ought to be 
allowed to decide for himself," acknowledging that such a notion probably was a 
pipe dream. "Well why not," he said, "playing in the majors was a dream come 
true in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
One of the senior league's luminaries, ex-Yankee Graig Nettles, is also a 
dreamer. Said Nettles when he joined the league, "If I can stay in baseball, I 
may never have to grow up." 
</P>
<P>
Lacy and Harrah both played for the West Palm Beach Tropics, who wound up 
winning their Southern Division title but losing in a championship game to the 
St. Petersburg Pelicans. Perhaps you missed it. 
</P>
<P>
The Tropics' theme song was a Steve Winwood tune, "Back in the High Life 
Again." 
</P>
<P>
Its promising words -- "I'll be back in the high life again All the eyes that 
watched me once will smile and take me in." -- had a forlorn and ironic ring, 
however, blaring over the loudspeaker before every home game, echoing across 
rows of empty seats in a small-town ballpark that real major leaguers used only 
for spring training. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Lacy loved the major league high life, all right, what ballplayers call the 
Show. 
</P>
<P>
He traveled first class and slept on fine linen and left wake-up calls and 
dined at tables with tapered candles and, oh, how he savored the cheers, cheers 
of sellout crowds in three World Series and in the Pittsburgh grandstands in 
1984 when he led his league in fielding and finished second in batting. 
</P>
<P>
"My, my, my," Lacy said, his face cradled in a smile of sweet memory. 
</P>
<P>
Then, last year, after 1,523 major league games, 4,549 times at bat, 1,303 
hits, 91 home runs, the Baltimore Orioles read the last rites over Leondaus 
Lacy, outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody just told me, 'Sorry, Lee, goodby,' " Lacy said. "All he left out 
was, 'May you rest in peace.' " 
</P>
<P>
But Lee Lacy found no peace in the valley, a valley as dark as his prospects 
for greatness had seemed back in the Oakland housing project where he was 
raised. 
</P>
<P>
At age 7, learning from older guys, he took a match to a tennis ball and burned 
off the fuzz so it resembled a baseball. What he had lit was a career that 
would blaze in glory and, at a time other professionals consider their prime, 
end just as unexpectedly in ashes. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't get over the shock of that," Lacy said. "I couldn't accept it. I 
moped around. I felt lost. I was not a pleasant person. My wife and I started a 
little telephone answering service, something to do, to feel worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
"But every night I prayed. I said, 'Lord, if there is any chance, any chance 
that I can play baseball again, let it be."' 
</P>
<P>
Lacy reflected on his fate one evening in late January just at nightfall, his 
long legs stretched out in the aisle of his team's charter bus making its way 
across southern Florida. Out the window he saw no bright lights, just a weary 
landscape of flat brown canebrakes and dark flat swamps along arrow-straight 
roads. 
</P>
<P>
Was the answer to his prayer, then, really a minor Ephipany, a deliverance from 
the Stygian twilight into one more moment in the sun? Or was it a cruel 
prolonging of the inevitable agony? 
</P>
<P>
"When they let me go," said Lacy, "I knew in my heart I could still play 
baseball. Now I have proved, to my own satisfaction at least, that I was right. 
When the time finally comes to toss it in I will know what to expect and will 
accept it." 
</P>
<P>
Accepting it apparently is more difficult for the superstars than for 
journeymen athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks Robinson, who dazzled a nation of fans with his play at third base, 
discovered, on retirement at age 40, that "the only thing worse than being down 
and out is going up and down and out." 
</P>
<P>
"The big thing," said Robinson, "is that you don't know what you're going to do 
or where you're going to go. The single hardest thing about leaving is that 
you're leaving a love, a passion. It was my whole life." 
</P>
<P>
A few years later Robinson discovered another agony of a vanished hero. 
</P>
<P>
On a visit to the Oakland A's clubhouse, wearing a suit and tie, a clubhouse 
boy asked, "Who are you?" 
</P>
<P>
"Brooks Robinson." 
</P>
<P>
"Do you play ball?" 
</P>
<P>
Most athletes try to hang onto the fringes of their sport, coaching, scouting, 
selling equipment. Robinson and Harrah and Al Hrabosky, another big name on the 
Tropics, got into broadcasting. But many of the former players, lesser lights, 
put aside jobs as truck drivers or beer salesmen, or telephone answerers, to 
rush headlong to the senior league. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Broberg is a rarity. After pitching eight years in the majors, he went to 
law school in 1978 at age 30 and began a new career. (He took a leave from his 
practice in West Palm Beach to join the home team "so my children could see me 
play the game I love so much.") 
</P>
<P>
"Most players," Broberg said, "realize it would take them 20 years to learn to 
do anything as well as they know how to play baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"Most other professionals, lawyers, doctors, brokers, at age 35 or 40 are just 
beginning to feel they are competent, at the top of their game, so to speak. 
The same is true of athletes, at least mentally. Yet that's the age athletes 
are told they're through. That's hard to cope with. That's the sadness." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Wolff, the director of sports books for Macmillan, did a master's thesis 
on the problems athletes face at career's end. He has developed a counseling 
program which leads the athlete through the phases of denial, anger, 
bargaining, depression and, finally, acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
If the program sounds familiar it is because it is based on the model for 
terminally ill people from the book "On Death and Dying." 
</P>
<P>
At least one line from the Tropics' anthem "Back in the High Life Again" is as 
true, it seems, as a called strike: 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're born to run, it's so hard to just slow down." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the real sadness.

<P>
POWERHOUSE: THE CONQUISTADORE STORY PROMISES MORE GLORY WITH COACH LUDLOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the intensely competitive, increasingly high-profile world of high school 
athletics, Coach Neils Ludlow is an anomaly. 
</P>
<P>
Ludlow is the unlikely and unsung leader of the El Camino Real High softball 
team, one of the greatest juggernauts in City Section history. The 
Conquistadores have won six 4-A Division championships in the past seven years 
and have reached the 4-A final every year since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
From 1983-87, El Camino Real owned the state's longest softball winning streak, 
a fabulous run of 73 consecutive games during which Karen Walker (UCLA) and 
Beth Silverman (Arizona) helped establish the Woodland Hills school as a prime 
source for Division I college material. 
</P>
<P>
And the beat goes on. 
</P>
<P>
The Conquistadores (23-2 last season), led by senior pitcher Chrissy Peck, last 
year's 4-A Player of the Year, are stockpiled with talent, ready to begin their 
quest for a third consecutive City title. 
</P>
<P>
Yet despite the team's fearsome reputation Ludlow, contrary to the image of a 
hollering, win-at-all-costs ogre, rules El Camino Real with fists unclenched. 
</P>
<P>
Ludlow, 50, oversees El Camino Real in a tranquil, almost grandfatherly 
fashion. It is almost as if Ludlow, who holds a master's degree from Pepperdine 
in education administration, is just along for the ride. 
</P>
<P>
"I just fill my role," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Ludlow is reluctant -- in fact, he flatly refuses -- to accept plaudits for the 
team's success. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't give too much credit to me," Ludlow says. "A lot of times in life, you 
find yourself in the right place at the right time. I'm a firm believer in 
that." 
</P>
<P>
After transferring from Parkman Junior High in 1985, Ludlow, a mathematics 
instructor, agreed to take command largely because of a shortage of coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Ludlow, who had coached for only a few years in church leagues, was reluctant 
to believe that under his guidance El Camino Real, already a two-time defending 
City champion, would continue to dominate. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know what anyone expected," he said. "I thought we would do the best 
we could possibly do." 
</P>
<P>
This season, with Peck and fellow All-West Valley League players Cathy Balint 
(shortstop) and Alisha Knopf (second base), and senior All-City catcher Jenny 
Fleming, the Conquistadores should do fine. In fact, a ninth consecutive league 
title seems imminent. 
</P>
<P>
Peck, 64-13 in three seasons (she transferred from Bel-Air Prep after her 
sophomore year), was 22-2 last season and batted .571. She pitched a one-hitter 
in the title game to defeat San Pedro, 1-0. College recruiters are waiting in 
the wings. 
</P>
<P>
Ludlow shaped his team with the assistance of Gary Torgeson, who has coached 
Cal State Northridge to four National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division II 
titles since 1983. From Torgeson, Ludlow learned the concept of "little ball" 
-- a bunt single here, a stolen base there, a squeeze play here equals a slew 
of victories. 
</P>
<P>
When pressed, Ludlow allows himself a dab of due. But not much. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I really do my part," he said. "I like to think I'm organized. I like 
to think I'm competitive. But no way do I want to assume credit for what's 
going on." 
</P>
<P>
Other area programs to watch: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CITY SECTION 
</P>
<P>
* Sylmar (East Valley League) -- The Spartans (13-2 last season) will rely on 
sophomore right-handers Ruby Gonzalez and Krystina Moore to replace Deann 
Wright, now at CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
"I came in thinking, 'Oh, my gosh, where am I going to find a pitcher?' " Coach 
Chuck Miller said. "Then I found two." 
</P>
<P>
Seniors Missy Herrera (third base) and Wendy Alcantar (shortstop) batted better 
than .400 last year. So did senior center fielder Irene Aguilar. 
</P>
<P>
* Kennedy (North Valley League) -- Kennedy, which lost to Banning in the 4-A 
quarterfinals last year, might have met the Conquistadores in last season's 
final had right-hander Sabrina Davis (15-3) not been lifted in the fifth inning 
against Banning because of the flu. Kennedy lost, 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, a senior, returns. Third baseman Maria Fujarte is the only other 
returning senior. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Cathy Miyahira (right field) returns. Newcomers include senior second 
baseman Flavia Fleischer and senior outfielder Alecia Verdugo. 
</P>
<P>
* Poly (East Valley League) -- Poly reached the 3-A Division semifinal last 
season, finishing 19-1 after losing to South Gate, the eventual champion. 
</P>
<P>
Three players return: senior right-hander Jodi Soto (13-1, 0.96 ERA), a 
two-time All-City selection; senior all-league second baseman Tracy Bell; and 
junior catcher Kristie Faehnle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SOUTHERN SECTION 
</P>
<P>
* Hart (Foothill League) -- The Indians (29-2), who reached the 4-A 
quarterfinal last year, rate as the best Southern Section team in the Valley, 
and senior right-hander Kym Weil ranks as the area's premier pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Weil was 25-2 last season with 299 strikeouts and a 0.12 ERA in 178 innings. 
She also pitched 15 shutouts and surrendered only three earned runs. Not 
surprisingly, she has received scholarship offers from several colleges, 
including UC Santa Barbara, Oregon, Arizona and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Senior catcher Stephanie Keeler (.349, two home runs) has attracted the 
interest of Hawaii, Oregon, Long Beach State and CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
Other returnees include junior shortstop Krissy Carpenter (.243), who was 4-0 
with a 0.93 ERA as Weil's backup. Sophomore designated-hitter Jamie Dean batted 
a team-high .402 with a school-record 37 hits. 
</P>
<P>
* Thousand Oaks (Marmonte League) -- The Lancers (25-6), two-time defending 
league champions, have six returning players but some will switch positions. 
</P>
<P>
Trisha Gregoire moves from third base to catcher, and Amy Chellevold moves from 
left field to first base. Both were All-Southern Section 5-A selections as 
juniors. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Erikka Gulbranson moves from right field to second base. Senior Lisa 
Stoddard, a reserve last season, will start at third base and also will serve 
as a relief pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Four-year starter Phronsie Franco returns at shortstop. Senior right-hander 
Alicia Zinner has improved markedly. 
</P>
<P>
* Simi Valley (Marmonte League) -- The Pioneers have finished second in league 
play three consecutive years and they're tired of it, Coach Suzanne Manlet 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're shooting for first place," she said. 
</P>
<P>
That's a lofty goal considering that all-league pitcher Chrissy Oliver (10-6) 
has moved on to Oklahoma State. 
</P>
<P>
But 6-foot-1 junior Heather Santiago (11-2 last season) is a capable 
replacement. Returning infielders Taina Tande (shortstop) and Amy Powell 
(second base), both sophomores, give the Pioneers strength up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
* Notre Dame (San Fernando Valley League) -- Right-hander Becca Berline (17-9 
last season), the league MVP the past two years, and catcher Simona Errico form 
a four-year battery. 
</P>
<P>
Berline is 53-19 in her career. Errico was the most powerful hitter for the 
Knights (17-10 last season), who reached the 2-A semifinals last season. 
</P>
<P>
Four other players return: Senior center fielder Kim Fischer (all-league) and 
juniors shortstop Vivian Carballo, first baseman Karen Erickson and right 
fielder Karen Ljubetico. 
</P>
<P>
* Alemany (San Fernando Valley League) -- The Indians, who finished second last 
season with a 7-3 mark (16-10 overall), have 11 returning players. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore second baseman Krista Gomez hit six home runs to set a school record 
for a freshman. Catcher Patti Seresi, also a sophomore, hit three home runs and 
junior first baseman-designated-hitter Brenda Garcia hit two. Alemany hit 18 
home runs last year. 
</P>
<P>
* Agoura (Frontier League) -- Agoura (23-2), the defending 1-A with a 20-game 
winning streak, will be competing next season in the Marmonte League -- a leap 
to the 5-A level. 
</P>
<P>
Junior right-hander Melissa Thatcher, entering her third varsity season, was 
23-2 last season with 156 strikeouts and a 0.63 earned-run average in 178 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
* La Reina (Tri-Valley League) -- La Reina, which reached the 1-A quarterfinals 
last season, has more returning starters than any other team in the league -- 
and three pitchers from which to choose. 
</P>
<P>
Senior right-hander Sherri Sisco, the league's most valuable player as a 
sophomore, was hobbled by a foot injury most of last season. Freshman 
right-hander Michelle St. Pierre has been impressive.

CANYONS RIPS VENTURA IN 20-13 VICTORY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
College of the Canyons banged out 18 hits and scored 20 runs Saturday to roll 
to a 20-13 Western State Conference baseball victory over host Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a good old-fashioned slugfest," Canyons Coach Len Mohney said. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's outburst came on the heels of an 18-8 win over Santa Barbara City 
College, giving the Cougars 38 runs in their first two conference games. 
</P>
<P>
"We have actually been struggling on offense until this week," Mohney said. 
"The offense just started happening and it becomes contagious for the whole 
team." 
</P>
<P>
Canyons (10-5 overall) jumped to a 4-0 lead in the first inning on a two-out 
grand slam by freshman Charlie Fowlks. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons added five more runs in the second and led, 11-5, after three innings. 
But Ventura (8-5, 0-2), the defending WSC champion, battled back to score five 
runs in the bottom of the fourth to make the score 11-10. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons scored four more runs -- on a run-scoring grounder by Jason Stanley, a 
run-scoring triple by Billy Horvat and RBI singles by Ron Robart and Josh 
Bergara -- in the sixth inning for a 15-10 lead, then closed its scoring in the 
seventh as Horvat and Robart keyed a five-hit, five-run inning. 
</P>
<P>
While Ventura had 17 hits of its own, the Pirates could not overcome a wild 
performance from eight pitchers who combined to give up 13 walks. PAUL OLSON

<TEXT>
<P>
Scott Coleman and Jim Roby combined to throw a no-hitter for Orange Glen, and 
Coleman had five runs-batted in as the Patriots defeated Mar Vista, 14-0, in a 
season-opening Warhawk Tournament game. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman hit a bases-loaded home run during Orange Glen's six-run first inning. 
</P>
<P>
He also struck out nine in four innings. 
</P>
<P>
"After the grand slam, his adrenaline was pumping the rest of the day," Orange 
Glen Coach Ken Walker said. "He was on top of things." 
</P>
<P>
In other Warhawk Tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
Serra 12, San Dieguito 9 -- Serra scored a total of 11 runs in the second and 
third innings, overcoming host San Dieguito's eight in the first two innings. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Kerr (1-0) came on in the third inning and didn't allow a hit in four 
innings of work for Serra (1-0). Murry Estabrook had two hits and three RBIs 
for Serra and Mike Miller and Justin Wible each had two hits and two RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
San Dieguito (0-1) scored four runs in the second on a three-base throwing 
error. 
</P>
<P>
"We really played some little league baseball and looked pretty silly in the 
second inning, but we tied them and went ahead," Serra Coach Ken Sovay said. 
</P>
<P>
Kearny 11, Bonita Vista 4 -- Eddie Feistel went three for three and Jason 
Redondo and Jermaine Matthews each had two hits for visiting Kearny.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: PADRES RENEW CONTRACTS OF FOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Padres Saturday renewed the contracts of first basemen Rob Nelson and Phil 
Stephenson, infielder Joey Cora and pitcher Dan Murphy, the final four players 
on their spring training roster who were unsigned. All 37 players on the 1990 
spring training roster are now under contract. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres also announced that Roger Riley has been named assistant director of 
media relations, filling the post vacated by Mike Swanson, who was promoted to 
director of media relations last week. 
</P>
<P>
Riley, 30, was the lead statistician for CBS Sports for the past eight years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL 
</P>
<P>
Darrell Scott pitched Loyola Marymount to victories in both games of a West 
Coast Conference doubleheader over visiting University of San Diego. Loyola 
Marymount won the first game, 6-5, and the second, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
Scott (3-1) came on in the eighth inning of the first game and shut USD down. 
He then scored the winning run in the bottom of the ninth when Chris Gomez 
singled to right with two out. Scott reached base on a fielding error by USD 
third baseman Kevin Herde. Loyola Marymount's Miah Bradbury set a school record 
for doubles (62) with a first inning double. Tom Cheek (5-1) took the loss for 
USD. 
</P>
<P>
Scott started and went the distance in the second game, stopping USD on eight 
hits. Joe Testa hit a bases-empty two-out home run to left-center to break a 
3-3 tie for Loyola Marymount (11-6, 6-2). Lou Skertich (1-2) was the loser for 
USD (7-10, 4-5). 
</P>
<P>
Henry Jimenez went four for nine and had three RBIs as visiting UC San Diego 
swept a doubleheader from Cal State San Bernardino, 7-3 and 9-7. 
</P>
<P>
Dann Eaton (2-0) was the winner in the first game for UCSD (6-6), and Ernie 
Isola went three for four with three RBIs. Rick Rupkey (3-2) went six innings 
and earned the victory in the second game, and Louie Diaz was two for four with 
three RBIs for UCSD. Cal State San Bernardino is 3-6. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. International third baseman Pat Cheek extended his hitting streak to 16 
games, but the Gulls were defeated by visiting Cal State Long Beach, 15-5, in a 
nonconference game. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Whisonant (1-5) started but only lasted three innings for USIU (5-11-1). 
Eric Gruben (4-0) was the winner for Cal State Long Beach (14-6). 
</P>
<P>
Aztec Bill Dunckel hit a sacrifice fly to score the winning run in the bottom 
of the eighth inning to lead SDSU to a 4-3 nonconference victory over UC 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Eric Christopherson threw out three runners and was three-for-four with 
a double for SDSU (10-5). Irvine fell to 11-7. SDSU's Rusty Filter struck out 
five and picked up his first victory. 
</P>

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 
</P>
<P>
Julie Evans scored 27 points, but host San Diego State was defeated by Fresno 
State, 93-60, in a Big West Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
Dee Dee Davis (15 points) was the only other player to reach double figures for 
SDSU (6-22, 7-12). Simone Srubek had 27 for Fresno State (18-10, 11-7). 
</P>

SOFTBALL 
</P>
<P>
Host UC San Diego, helped by 11 Whittier errors, won the first game of a 
nonconference doubleheader, 9-2, but lost the second, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie Molina, Cindi Murphy and Kris Melican all had two hits for UCSD (2-6)

six hits. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU picked up its first victory of the season, in its second game of pool play 
in the UNLV tournament in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs defeated Southern Utah State, 3-2, after dropping a 3-1 decision to

MOM AND DAD HUXTABLE DO VEGAS; 
</P>
<P>
A SHOWROOM ACT BY BILL COSBY AND PHYLICIA RASHAD IS PART OF THE GAMING RESORT'S 
WOOING OF FAMILIES

If it's skin Vegas audiences want, they won't get it from Mom and Dad Huxtable. 
</P>
<P>
"There'll be no G-strings in my show," drawled Phylicia Rashad, ending the 
pronouncement with her patented "Cosby Show" giggle. She shook her finger, 
playfully scolding, more in the mock-serious manner of Mrs. Clair Huxtable than 
as the singer/dancer/actress/wife of NBC sportscaster Ahmad Rashad. 
</P>
<P>
"And if there are G-strings, they'll be under the garments so no one will see," 
she said, unsuccessfully trying to check the giggle. "No G-strings!" 
</P>
<P>
The First Mom of TV sitcoms hunkered down in one corner of the broken-down 
black Naugahyde couch that sits in front of the stage inside the S.I.R. sound 
studios on Manhattan's upper west side. As she rehearsed for her recent Las 
Vegas club debut, billed alongside her TV husband, Bill Cosby, Rashad unzipped 
a black and white ski jacket to reveal a skin-tight pink leotard underneath. 
She smiled. Her teeth are perfect, testimony, perhaps, to the fact that both 
her father and the first of her three real-life husbands were dentists. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, Las Vegas is a community I'm told, where people live who have nothing 
to do with show business," she continued, peeling off another layer of 
cold-weather clothing as she spoke. 
</P>
<P>
On the opposite side of the studio, a host of veteran musicians who have played 
backup to the likes of Luther Vandross, Judy Collins and Ashford and Simpson, 
warmed up for yet another run-through in the string of rehearsals that began 
six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got a university there," the 41-year-old actress said. "They've got 
churches there. They've got schools there. They've got people living life 
there!" 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Las Vegas is not what it once was. Nevada's largest city is at least as 
well-known these days for UNLV Coach Jerry Tarkanian's winning basketball team 
as it is for hoodlums, gambling, golf and the sunny weather. 
</P>
<P>
During February in New York, Popsicle-like winds make G-strings sound more like 
an instrument of torture than lust. Clear and sunny Las Vegas represents 
another world in more ways than one. The famous Strip, where casino hotels play 
host to more than 18 million visitors a year, seems as contrary to the family 
image she and Cosby have fostered as Mr. and Mrs. Cliff Huxtable as do 
showgirls in a snowstorm. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, Mom and Dad Huxtable have, indeed, brought their brand of good, clean 
family fun to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Rashad is headlining alongside her TV husband through March 11 at the Hilton. 
In her final rehearsals two weeks ago in New York, she alternated between 
anxious and confident that her song-and-dance routines would be a hit, even 
though she's been planning the show since July. But she has her bets covered. 
Any chance that showroom crowds might yawn through her renditions of "As Time 
Goes By" or Stevie Wonder's "Overjoyed" is diminished by the advice she gets 
from the father figure she "married" on the Cosby show. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill and I were supposed to debut in November, but the musician's strike was 
still on," Rashad said. "In January, there was some talk about some performers 
crossing the picket line and I talked to Bill about that and he said: 'No, I 
don't want you going in like that. You just wait.' " 
</P>
<P>
Cosby is shrewd enough to know that crossing picket lines is a potential public 
relations disaster, especially for the Huxtables. The 52-year-old entertainer, 
who reportedly hand-picked Rashad from among dozens who auditioned for the role 
of Mrs. Huxtable when the sitcom was cast seven years ago, is no stranger to 
the Strip. Commanding more than $300,000 a week, he holds the title of No. 1 
draw among the dozens of Las Vegas attractions that play the city's showrooms 
and lounges each year, according to the Las Vegas News Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
With typical excess, Las Vegas bills itself as "the Entertainment Capital of 
the World," even though cynics gave it the more accurate, if less flattering 
title of "a Disneyland for adults." 
</P>
<P>
But whatever its epithet, the one-time Mormon settlement at the southern end of 
Nevada is arguably the last place Huxtable fans might expect to find the tube's 
most popular prime-time parents. 
</P>
<P>
Yet as Rashad and others point out, audiences have changed and Las Vegas has 
changed with them. Lounge pianists who insist on whining their version of 
"Feelings," bare-breasted showgirls with Kewpie doll smiles and foul comedy a 
la Redd Foxx may be Strip perennials, but their appeal to balding baby boomers 
is limited. With the mellowing of the '60s generation, a new brand of 
entertainer is beginning to surface in Las Vegas. Sinatra still packs them in, 
though he has slipped to the No. 2 spot in terms of salary and audience behind 
Cosby. Julio Iglesias (No. 3), Wayne Newton and Englebert Humperdinck can 
always be depended upon to make grandmothers swoon. 
</P>
<P>
But the Pointer Sisters and the , Beach Boys do all right when they come to 
town too. As more yuppies approach middle age, they contribute a larger share 
to the $4 billion lost at the casinos each year. They also demand younger 
entertainers for themselves and more family entertainment for their children. 
What could have more wholesome yuppie family appeal than, say, the Moscow 
Circus that had a weeklong run here last month? Or Sid and Marty Krofft's 
Puppets? Or Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton appearing on the same bill for the 
first time in years? 
</P>
<P>
So what's so strange about Cliff and Clair Huxtable in Vegas? 
</P>
<P>
"The typical Las Vegas show is still the big production that features 
bare-breasted showgirls," said Las Vegas News Bureau media director Stephen 
Allen. "Like 'Jubilee' at Bally's. It's got 125 performers. Big production 
numbers." 
</P>
<P>
Allen is a former Philadelphia newspaperman who came to Las Vegas for a weekend 
12 years ago and wound up staying. Until Hollywood entrepreneur Kirk Kerkorian 
sold the MGM Grand Hotel to Bally's in the mid-'80s, Allen was the hotel's 
public relations director. Since then, he has run the non-stop press release 
division of the city's convention and visitors bureau and, from that vantage 
point, he's seen a subtle but clear shift in the way in which the casinos 
entertain their guests. 
</P>
<P>
"The stereotypical visitor here used to be the guy who came here with his 
'niece' or his girlfriend to gamble for the weekend," Allen said. "Now these 
are still gambling casinos. They're not Disneyland yet." 
</P>
<P>
But the writing is on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Witness the very face of the Strip, where the Golden Nugget's Steve Wynn just 
opened a $500-million, 3,600-room hotel next to Caesars Palace last year. The 
32-story marvel, called the Mirage, has a waterfall cascade system and a fiery 
two-story high volcano in its front courtyard that erupts regularly throughout 
the evening. It was such a traffic stopper along Las Vegas Boulevard that 
Mirage management put up a permanent sign advising motorists not to be so 
distracted that they caused an auto accident. 
</P>
<P>
This June, another mammoth hostelry opens about a mile west, near the end of 
the strip adjacent to the Hacienda Hotel. Excalibur, a 4,000-room hotel built 
in the style of a medieval castle, is the second Strip casino built by the 
operators of the hugely successful Circus Circus hotel and will feature a kind 
of permanent Renaissance Pleasure Faire atmosphere, complete with daily 
jousting tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if you know anything about occupancy rates, but Circus Circus has 
a phenomenal annual percentage of 98%," Allen said. "That's because they cater 
to family business." 
</P>
<P>
Circus Circus room rates remain low ($40-$60 range). In addition, a huge 
recreational vehicle lot behind the casino invites families to hook up and stay 
awhile. Trapeze acts perform around the clock and, in a "Midway" mezzanine 
between the gamblers and the high-wire acts, children can play video and arcade 
games while they eat cotton candy and popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
With Excalibur, Circus Circus owners again plan to cater to families, but they 
are no longer going to have a monopoly on the kiddie market. 
</P>
<P>
"MGM just bought the Marina Hotel and the 147-acre Tropicana golf course next 
to it," Allen said. "By the end of 1992, they plan to build a 145-acre 
movieland-type theme park and the biggest hotel in the world: 5,000 rooms. For 
the first time, Las Vegas is going to be a vacation destination, like Orlando, 
Fla. I mean, why would you go to Orlando if Epcot Center wasn't there?" 
</P>
<P>
At least two other "theme" hotel casinos are on the drawing boards: 
</P>
<P>
* A $22-million Irish pub called O'Shea's, to be constructed next to the 
Flamingo Hilton at the midway point on the Strip. 
</P>
<P>
* A 3,000-room hotel adjacent to the Dunes, to be called Carnivaal. That 
$300-million effort is being underwritten by the Radisson Corp. 
</P>
<P>
And virtually every existing Strip hotel along the five-mile stretch of neon 
roadway is planning a major expansion in the next two to three years. Caesars 
Palace will add an 875,000-square-foot shopping plaza by the end of the summer. 
The Sahara has added another 575 rooms. The Imperial Palace is adding another 
547 rooms. The Flamingo Hilton will add another 750 rooms. And the Riviera, 
which will expand to 4,179 rooms over the next two years, said Allen, will 
temporarily become the world's largest luxury hotel until the MGM project just 
down the road supersedes it. 
</P>
<P>
In all, this city of about 600,000 permanent residents will have more than 
80,000 hotel rooms by the mid-1990s, and most of them will cater to families. 
</P>
<P>
"A reporter for Entertainment News came through here a few weeks ago and she 
told me, 'Gosh, I remember staying at the youth hotel when I was a kid and my 
parents came here on vacation.' Makes you feel old," said Las Vegas Hilton 
publicist Carol Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is Las Vegas' oldest and best-known kids' hotel -- the Las Vegas 
Hilton youth hotel -- is just about 20 years old, said Stewart. The 120-room 
wing of the venerable Hilton at the northeast end of the Strip blazed the trail 
for the families that are now flooding the city. Early on, Hilton executives 
understood that mothers and fathers would be far more likely to go gambling if 
they didn't have to worry about keeping the children amused. So they did it for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"The youth hotel's got a pool table and video arcade and just about everything 
a kid would want: popcorn, hot dogs, hamburgers, a regular kids' menu," Stewart 
said. "Special little Murphy beds that come out of the wall and make the place 
into a dormitory. Supervised child care. Entertainment. It's tailored to 
children." 
</P>
<P>
And slowly, showroom entertainment is becoming more palatable to small fry too. 
</P>
<P>
"Splash!," a typical vaudevillian revue in an indefinite run at the Riviera 
Hotel, has a family version at 8 p.m. and a topless version at 11 p.m. The most 
expensive show on the Strip these days -- Siegfried &amp; Roy's $60-a-seat wild 
animal extravaganza -- is also the most Barnum and Bailey-esque. 
</P>
<P>
As far as music, the real-life yuppie families who visit Vegas increasingly 
reflect the upscale tastes of the make-believe Huxtables. 
</P>
<P>
"David Sanborn is a jazz musician we booked recently for three nights," Stewart 
said. "The first night, the room wasn't full but, then, the second and third 
night, he sold out. I think that's a definite trend: shorter runs for 
entertainers with an intense following. No banter or dirty jokes or fancy girls 
or dancing. Just music. The straight goods." 
</P>
<P>
Broad appeal entertainers who can pack the evolving gambler audience into the 
showrooms are harder and harder to find, let alone to persuade to work up acts 
for Vegas, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you watch the Grammys ?" she asked. "You can see the incredible changes 
going on in the music business. 
</P>
<P>
"If you were thinking of buying any of those acts to try and sell out an 
1,800-seat showroom every night, which one would it be? Of all the people I saw 
on the Grammys, Bonnie Raitt would probably be the only one that could even 
think of filling a showroom. 
</P>
<P>
"The others may be new and interesting and have tremendous value within the 
industry, but for the kind of people that go to showrooms and the market you're 
dealing with, I don't think they're going to come and see a rap group, for 
instance." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the new wave of post-World War II moms and dads who are winding their 
way into the casinos, and dragging their children along with them, Las Vegas 
continues to attract a particular type of tourist, bred on television and 
facing middle age with a relatively good line of credit. 
</P>
<P>
"People who have enough money to come here and pay the price to go into these 
showrooms are not interested in rap or Milli Vanilli," Stewart said. "I'll 
probably be proven completely wrong in the next few years, but the ones who 
seem to endure are the ones who have real traditional talents. Who can really 
sing and can really do what they are purported to do, not just thrill the crowd 
because they've got 8,000 synthesizers behind them." 
</P>
<P>
"Don't you find that in moments of purest inspiration that there is that which 
is greater than your personality?" asked Phylicia Rashad. Yes, an interviewer 
answered tentatively. But what does that have to do with playing Vegas? 
</P>
<P>
"Right. OK. I've been practicing Sita yoga now for almost 10 years and when I 
first met Swami Mustananada, it was at a creativity conference," she continued, 
the words spilling out of her with a pleasant, manic urgency. "And he started 
his talk after welcoming people with love! and respect! Because he said that 
was the highest action that a human being could perform: To welcome another 
human being with love and respect. He said that was true religion. That was 
worship of God." 
</P>
<P>
But, Vegas? 
</P>
<P>
"And after he made that statement, he said, 'God is the great actor of the 
universe and he is playing many parts. He is the star of the show', " continued 
a woman who sounded less and less like Clair Huxtable with each sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"And then he went on to talk about creative process and about that energy, 
about that intelligence, about that source from which inspiration springs which 
is really one's very own self!" 
</P>
<P>
All around her, musical bedlam is breaking loose. The bass player is dancing on 
stage while the piano player plays football out on the floor with the 
percussionist. A couple of dancers twitch and sway on the opposite side of the 
S.I.R. studio while Rashad's choreographer, Michael Peters performs a lithe 
leap reminiscent of the steps he taught Michael Jackson for the now-legendary 
"Beat It!" music video. 
</P>
<P>
But Rashad remains calm. She lets the concept of mantra sink in for a moment, 
her seemingly permanently smiling eyes crinkled at the corners. 
</P>
<P>
What she's driving at, she says, is that it all ties in. She can't perform for 
two hours on stage before a Vegas audience without her mantra routine: one hour 
of chanting in a silent room she has set aside strictly for meditation every 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
It is the same mantra that the monks spoke throughout "Indiana Jones and the 
Temple of Doom," she says. The mantra is a panacea she draws upon whenever the 
frustrations of getting a vocal arrangement or a dance step just right prove 
too overwhelming. It's scientifically proven, she says. The brain waves flatten 
out when the mantra takes over. It gives her the power to concentrate, to focus 
and to let go -- to let her act happen instead of making it happen. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not worried about it," she says about her appearance before the TV-fed 
family audience that is sure to come see her and Mr. Huxtable on stage. "I'm 
really not worried about it. I know better. I sit quietly for that hour every 
single day and experience that witness inside. Experience that part of yourself 
that watches the movements of the mind." 
</P>
<P>
Armed with her New-Age consciousness, Phylicia Rashad is more than prepared to 
gamble on a New Age audience in the heart of Sin City. It seems appropriate 
somehow. 
</P>
<P>
"Ohhhm naah mashi vaya," she says out above the din inside the studio. 
"Ohhhhhhhhm naahh mashi vaya." 
</P>
<P>
She grins her perfect grin and giggles. 
</P>
<P>
"All right! I'm ready!" she says, displaying a girlishness Cliff Huxtable's 
wife would never show. But, then, Mrs. Huxtable would probably never play 
Vegas, regardless of who was in the audience.

THE OLD GLOBE HAS BECOME A TESTING GROUND FOR NEW YORK SHOWS, BUT IT'S TRYING 
TO AVOID COMPROMISING ITS CLASSICAL COMMITMENT

<TEXT>
<P>
The Old Globe Theatre will premiere Neil Simon's latest comedy, "Jake's Women," 
on Thursday. The inevitable questions follow: 
</P>
<P>
Is Simon's story about a man and the women in his life -- dead wife, current 
wife, girlfriend, sister, daughter, therapist -- semi-autobiographical? 
Probably. Simon, whose best work is often semi-autobiographical, seems 
permanently surrounded by a constellation of women. 
</P>
<P>
Is the show going to Broadway after its debut here? 
</P>
<P>
Are you kidding? Don't all plays by the popular and prolific Simon go to 
Broadway? 
</P>
<P>
And what about the Old Globe -- is it going Broadway? 
</P>
<P>
More specifically, is this venerable, 56-year-old institution flirting with an 
identity crisis, as it tries to straddle the dual roles of regional theater and 
Broadway tryout house? 
</P>
<P>
Any time writers in the league of Neil Simon or Stephen Sondheim are involved 
in new productions outside of New York, the likelihood is high from the outset 
that the shows will go on to Broadway productions. The Old Globe premiered 
three such shows in the last four years that went on to successful New York 
runs: Simon's "Rumors," Sondheim's "Into the Woods" and A. R. Gurney's "The 
Cocktail Hour." It also served as a secondary stop (read development station) 
for two August Wilson/Yale Repertory Theatre productions: "Joe Turner's Come 
and Gone" and "The Piano Lesson" (opening on Broadway April 16). 
</P>
<P>
All of which leads some to wonder: Does opening the door to Simon and Sondheim 
make the Old Globe a Broadway tryout house? 
</P>
<P>
Hold on. The very words, "Broadway tryout house," which have been bandied about 
in the media, have a bristling effect on Jack O'Brien, the Old Globe's artistic 
director. 
</P>
<P>
In his view, the Old Globe is first, last and always a regional theater that 
has its first loyalty to its San Diego audience. During a recent interview, 
O'Brien said that shows are picked for their interest to local, rather than New 
York audiences. Autonomy is maintained over each production. Case in point: 
Simon's longtime New York producer, Emanuel Azenberg (who doubled as best man 
at Simon's November wedding to ex-wife Diane Lander), is not involved in 
pre-production work. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people think, 'Oh, goodness, this theater is going to be taken over by 
a New York producer, or once we do this commercial piece, they'll never take us 
seriously again,' " O'Brien said. "There cannot be an identity crisis here 
because of the Globe's expected role as the repository of classical work. As 
long as we are clear about our classical commitment, our audience never gets 
nervous. 
</P>
<P>
"To have Neil here makes us work harder on the humor in our classical works. 
Putting Neil or Terrence McNally or Pete (A. R.) Gurney next to a classical 
play makes these pieces resonate and the classical work makes their tensile 
strength more stable. Every play was new at some time. Is there a philosophy 
here? We do the work we believe in." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Hall, the Globe's managing director, acknowledges an economic advantage to 
the New York connection, which has already returned about $250,000 in royalties 
to the Old Globe coffers by his calculation. The theater works on contracts 
that bring it anywhere from 1/2% to 1 1/2% of the gross receipts and 2 1/2% to 
5% of the net profits of a given show. But Hall minimizes the role of money in 
artistic decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"Ninety percent of the productions that everyone thinks have commercial 
viability fail," he said. "So only a fool would pick a play strictly because 
they thought it would have a commercial future. The Broadway theater is a 
little more risky than horse racing." 
</P>
<P>
The proof of these statements lies in the programming, O'Brien and Hall said. 
Shakespeare, still the Globe's resident playwright, will return in the summer 
with "Hamlet" and "As You Like It." "Jake's Women" steps onto the same space 
vacated by Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya." 
</P>
<P>
Simon's play, on the main stage, will run simultaneously with a new play by 
journalist-turned-playwright Mark Lee. "Rebel Armies Deep Into Chad" opened 
Saturday at the adjoining Cassius Carter Centre Stage. 
</P>
<P>
The director of Lee's play, Adrian Hall, one of the founders of the regional 
theater movement and former artistic director of both the Trinity Square 
Theatre and Dallas Theater Center, sees no problem in the Globe producing shows 
with commercial potential. For Adrian Hall, the key to the Globe's firm sense 
of identity lies in the fact that the show he is directing, by a relatively 
unknown writer, is getting as much time and attention as Simon's. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the days of worrying about the corruption of Broadway are over," he 
said during a rehearsal break. "Twenty years ago, it worried us all because 
were were all in such desperate straits, we would do anything. As we found a 
wider audience, it's changed." 
</P>
<P>
What has changed is that regional theaters no longer need Broadway for their 
bread and butter. Regional theater doesn't wait for Broadway to send it shows 
-- it can generate its own -- and depends not on royalties but on the loyalty 
of a firm subscription base. One of the ironies about the nonprofit vs. 
commercial theater question is how laughable it would have been just four years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
But then, 1986 was a pivotal year for the Old Globe. The nadir of 1986 came 
when O'Brien could not get a single producer to check out the world premiere of 
Stephen Metcalfe's "Emily" for a possible New York production. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that Time magazine had called the play one of the best of the year. 
Never mind that the Globe had won a special Tony as an outstanding regional 
theater in 1984. Producers did not go there to scout commercial projects in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
They would go to the La Jolla Playhouse to see shows such as "Big River," a 
West Coast premiere for the Playhouse that went on to win seven Tony awards 
including one for best direction by artistic director Des McAnuff. La Jolla had 
attracted national attention since its inception, perhaps because McAnuff was 
still working in the East for the better part of the year. (New York producers 
came as early as 1983 to check out "A Mad World My Masters," according to 
managing director Alan Levey.) 
</P>
<P>
But the Old Globe in 1986? Not yet. Not until Rocco Landesman, whose initial 
producing effort was "Big River," decided to work with the Old Globe on his 
second venture, Stephen Sondheim's "Into the Woods" in December 1986. The next 
year, Sondheim's musical went on to become a hit Broadway show, to be followed 
by the Old Globe premieres of "Rumors," another Broadway hit, and "The Cocktail 
Hour," an Off-Broadway hit. 
</P>
<P>
All of a sudden the theater that, for all of its huffing and puffing, could 
only push "Emily" to a swift opening and closing at Playwrights Horizons in New 
York was hot stuff -- a leader in the burgeoning field of regional 
theater/commercial theater partnerships. But the theater's leadership kept in 
mind what had made it hot stuff: providing a low-key atmosphere that gave 
artists the time and safe harbor to develop the work. 
</P>
<P>
When "Rumors" opened at the Old Globe, Simon was penning revisions every night. 
That didn't trouble the overflowing subscription audiences. But Azenberg, 
noting that the day of the out-of-town tryout was dead, said that the volume of 
changes encouraged here would not have been feasible in a non-regional theater, 
where there is pressure to make money. 
</P>
<P>
As could be expected, the headiness of 1988's successes resulted in a deluge of 
original scripts submitted for the 1989 season. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1989, the Old Globe only went with two new projects, neither of which 
went on to New York runs: Tom Dulack's "Breaking Legs," an extended hit with 
local audiences, and the much ballyhooed "Up in Saratoga," a new adaptation of 
a Bronson Howard farce by Terrence McNally under the direction of O'Brien that 
flopped in a major way (the production cost was $400,000), despite the advance 
blessings of New York producer Elizabeth McCann. 
</P>
<P>
The Old Globe played its hand with customary prudence, while other theaters 
like the San Diego Repertory Theatre, which produced a season of premieres, 
took a financial drubbing (the subscription renewal rate plummeted to 32% this 
year from 53% last year) and the nationally acclaimed La Jolla Playhouse, still 
struggling for a firm and dependable local following, announced that it would 
cancel its 1990 season if $500,000 was not raised by Dec. 31. (The Playhouse 
subsequently raised the money.) 
</P>
<P>
"Jake's Women" is the only world premiere of the 1990 winter or summer season 
at the Globe. "Cobb," a Yale Repertory Theatre production of Lee Blessing's 
play about Ty Cobb, will have its West Coast premiere here in June and if that 
goes on to New York, the Old Globe will be a limited partner sharing in the 
royalties in much the same way that they did when the theater produced the West 
Coast premieres of the Yale Rep's "Joe Turner's Come and Gone" and "The Piano 
Lesson." 
</P>
<P>
Understanding the virtues and limits of the regional to Broadway theater 
connection will continue to be a key skill in coming years, but financial 
realities dictate that the nonprofit/commercial partnerships are here to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago Landesman said it costs $1 million to $2 million to develop a 
show by the traditional out-of-town route, and only $100,000 to $200,000 to 
start them up in regional theaters. That makes what "Cocktail Hour" producer 
Thomas Viertel called "a natural coupling." 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego has got the hot theater hand," Viertel said. "It's likely to 
continue. The regional theater, because of its built-in subscription base, has 
the ability to withstand failure. But only the commercial producer can realize 
a show's financial potential." 
</P>
<P>
"When I came to San Diego in 1981, with few exceptions, it was still worth a 
laugh to my friends from the East Coast," O'Brien recalled in his Old Globe 
office before the opening of "Uncle Vanya" two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien spent the next nine years creating serious theater. And now that his 
New York friends are taking him seriously again, he feels he has the best of 
both worlds: working with top artists that once only associated with Broadway 
producers and working with them under conditions that emphasize the art over 
the financial bottom line. That had been one of the attractions of the Old 
Globe. While hits are as much in demand in a regional theater as anywhere else, 
a 12-play season gives an artistic director room to take a chance. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most potent symbols of the relationship between nonprofit and 
commercial theater lies in the relationship between O'Brien and Simon. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Simon fired O'Brien from his job as director of both the Los Angeles 
and Broadway productions of "I Ought to Be in Pictures." O'Brien says of the 
altercation, since resolved, that "it was as boring as you might imagine. He 
was digging in. I was digging out . . . I believe that Neil loves me as a 
colleague but doesn't think I can play his music. As a director, I believe I 
can direct anything. To be successful, you've got to have enough chutzpah to 
say, 'I can do anything.' " 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien's disappointment with the firing, as well as with the fate of the 
revival of "Most Happy Fella" (a musical he directed in 1980 that closed after 
just six weeks on Broadway), were key factors in his decision to turn his back 
on the commercial theater. 
</P>
<P>
Eight years later, Simon, too, found faults with the conventional out-of-town 
tryout. Even premiering new work in Los Angeles put too much pressure on a new 
script, he explained. The movie producers and stars who turned up inevitably 
judged his works in progress as being finished while he saw them as just 
getting started. 
</P>
<P>
"Being facile is impossible," said Simon before the opening of "Rumors." "I 
think every successful play I've had is successful because it was rewritten 
well." 
</P>
<P>
Simon and O'Brien had begun by talking, tentatively at first, about the 
possibility of producing Simon's newest project, "Jake's Women," at the Old 
Globe. Then when the play wasn't finished in time, Simon offered "A Foggy Day," 
a show to be built around a collection of Gershwin songs. When he got stalled 
on "Foggy Day," he offered "Rumors." 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien took "Rumors." Not a favorite with critics, it proved to be a hit with 
the public, playing to record numbers of patrons for a six-week run. 
</P>
<P>
Simon still hasn't asked O'Brien to direct any of his plays (Gene Saks staged 
"Rumors" and Ron Link is staging "Jake's Women," budgeted at $400,000), but 
O'Brien ranked high enough as a friend to merit an invitation to Simon's 
wedding. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the relationship between nonprofit and commercial theater is one 
O'Brien sees as deepening over time. 
</P>
<P>
"Green plants grow toward the sun," said O'Brien. "The sun in this case is a 
healthy theatrical climate. The healthy theatrical climate used to be the road 
and Broadway. Now you have to prove your stripes in a regional theater 
production. 
</P>
<P>
"These used to be dangerous woods and now they are only dangerous if you are 
unclear about who you are and what your mission is," he added. "Sometimes in 
the case of 'Breaking Legs' or 'Emily,' you don't get a pot of gold at the end 
of the rainbow, but no one would say those shows weren't successes. Sometimes 
successes go their own way. And sometimes you get invited uptown to dinner."

LARI PITTMAN: BREATHING LIFE INTO HIS ART

<P>
FACES 
</P>
<P>
One of Lari Pittman's goals with his new suite of paintings, "Beloved and 
Despised, It Continues Regardless," was to make the work alive. So alive, in 
fact, that viewers would feel the paintings were literally talking to them. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to make the work chattier and more conversational," said Pittman, 
whose show is at La Cienega Boulevard's Rosamund Felsen Gallery through 
Saturday. "I wanted you to be forced, because of the inhabitants in (the work), 
to talk back at it." 
</P>
<P>
Pittman called his new works, which include six 6-by-5-foot paintings, two 
massive 10-by-8-foot paintings and an accompanying suite of lithographs, "a 
litany of sorts" that scrutinize human behavior and the need for relationships. 
The conclusion, the 38-year-old Pittman says, is that "nothing has changed . . 
. desire is still a pulsating beat for people." 
</P>
<P>
Of course the "desire" depicted in the works isn't always your typical romantic 
desire. For instance, in "This Recipe: Beloved and Despised, It Continues 
Regardless," the artist has placed a pair of connected audiotapes inside a 
man's reproductive organs. These organs are linked to a woman's large womb, 
which is linked with an arrow to a young, pigtailed girl. Beneath them is an 
ongoing traffic jam, which in addition to cars, contains mechanical items such 
as radios. This, the artist says, depicts the economical basis of many 
relationships. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his Victorian-clad figures, Pittman, who in 1983 had his first 
one-person shows -- simultaneously -- at Rosamund Felsen and Newport Harbor Art 
Museum, paints a wealth of symbols. They range from arrows ("a way of directing 
the viewer in, around and through each piece in the same way that a good sign 
would do") to coffins ("to show the discussion of death and mortality as not 
inherently being a morbid topic"). 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like stingy work," the CalArts-trained Pittman says with a smile. "My 
paintings are very active and full. But I always know when they're finished -- 
a work is finished when it comes to a real agitated, full boil." 
</P>
<P>
THE SCENE 
</P>
<P>
After four years of operating Merging One Gallery in Santa Monica, Diana Wong 
is ready to close her gallery. She has taken out an ad in ArtNews magazine 
offering the space -- which is connected to her studio and home -- for rent. 
"It takes up all my time when I run the gallery," said Wong, who is herself a 
painter and would like to concentrate more time on her own art. "But I will 
continue doing it until I am able to lease it out." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Kohn Gallery is the latest of those that have moved to Santa Monica. 
The gallery, now at 920 Colorado Ave., is hosting its inaugural opening on 
Saturday with an exhibition of new work by New York-based painter Joan Nelson. 
Already moved into Michael Kohn's old space at 313 N. Robertson Blvd. is the 
new gallery Martin Lawrence Modern. Martin Lawrence's current show of original 
works on paper from the '60s, '70s and '80s by artist Tom Wesselmann runs 
through mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
A show at the Zero One Gallery on Melrose Avenue may literally knock your socks 
off. Entitled "Inaugural Gooseflesh," the exhibition attempts to channel 
Salvador Dali's spirit in a seance overseen by a professional trance-channeler. 
Produced by members of the Actors' Gang and Strike Theater, the "exhibition," 
at 8 p.m. Thursday and Friday nights through March 16, includes interactive 
installations relating to various aspects of Surrealism and Dadaism, as well as 
a performance based in part on playwright Andrew Dallmayer's "Hello Dali." 
Admission is $15. Information: (213) 466-7957. 
</P>
<P>
OVERHEARD: 
</P>
<P>
At Sotheby's Beverly Hills preview of an auction of the Harry A. Franklin 
Family Collection of African art last Tuesday night, a well dressed crowd of 
collectors, dealers, curators and artists gathered for a last look at a revered 
local collection that will be sold on April 21 in New York. While a few knowing 
collectors quietly speculated that a renowned Cameroon sculpture known as "The 
Bangwa Queen" would break the $2.08 million record for African art, a young man 
in tweeds told a well-coiffed matron in a Chanel suit, "If you dropped a 
million or two at an Impressionist auction, you might get a 10th-rate Renoir. 
If you spent the same amount at this auction, you could have a world-famous 
masterpiece with an impeccable pedigree." 
</P>
<P>
CURRENTS: 
</P>
<P>
The Craft and Folk Art Museum has received two major works valued at $200,000. 
The works were donated by museum trustee Daniel Greenberg and his wife, Susan 
Steinhauser, and will go into the museum's permanent collection. The first 
work, "Fantasy Mural" by Massachusetts-based artist Dan Dailey, is an 
8-by-8-foot construction composed of 64 individually etched glass panels that 
was commissioned by the American Craft Museum in New York. The second is 
"Rodia's Tower" by New York sculptor Steve Linn, an 11 1/2-by-9-foot glass 
sculpture that was inspired by the artist's visit to Los Angeles' Watts Towers. 
. . . In other Craft and Folk Art Museum news, Director Patrick Ela says 
attendance figures at the museum's new Wilshire/Fairfax May Co. home have 
tripled from those at the museum's previous site, at Wilshire Boulevard and 
Curson Avenue. According to Ela, weekend attendance at the museum (which opened 
on the fourth floor of the May Co. in November) now ranges from 400 to 600 
visitors per day.

SANDINISTAS CONCLUDE THEY LOST TOUCH WITH POPULACE 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three hours after the polls closed last Sunday, a Sandinista pollster at party 
headquarters handed Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega returns from a carefully 
chosen sample of 55,000 voters that showed him losing the battle for 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega was incredulous. Isn't the trend reversible? he asked. 
</P>
<P>
No, said the pollster, whose pre-election surveys had forecast a Sandinista 
landslide. 
</P>
<P>
"Wait, there are still more than a million votes to count," insisted Dionisio 
Marenco, the campaign chief. Huge speakers blared reggae music outside to 
Sandinista faithful who were waiting for official returns and a midnight 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until after 1 a.m. that Ortega privately admitted his loss, not 
until 6 a.m. that he conceded to the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The slow, painful dawning of that never-imagined defeat underscored the degree 
to which the Sandinista National Liberation Front had lost touch with the 
country it ruled for a decade. In post-election interviews, Sandinista leaders 
admit they were deceived by their own polls, their own rhetoric and the huge 
crowds they turned out to their rallies. 
</P>
<P>
"In 10 years, the front adopted the psychology of a party in power," Marenco 
said. "We were drunk with this idea that everything was OK. . . . We lost our 
capacity to converse, to listen, to criticize ourselves, the capacity to 
measure, and the people punished us for that." 
</P>
<P>
Still in shock from the returns, which gave Violeta Barrios de Chamorro and her 
National Opposition Union (UNO) 55% of the vote, some Sandinista officials 
admit with unusual candor that it's time to reshape their revolutionary 
movement as a democratic party. 
</P>
<P>
The Sandinista Front forged its identity in combat, ousting the Somoza 
dictatorship in a guerrilla war and later building a large army to fight the 
U.S.-backed Contras. Its full-fledged militants number about 40,000 and respond 
to a national directorate of nine comandantes. 
</P>
<P>
Some Sandinistas believe this elitist and undemocratic command structure, based 
on the need for military self-defense, removed the party from political reality 
and contributed to its electoral defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"We were a guerrilla army," said one high-ranking party official. "We had 
little time to talk about how to run the country. Everything was war. This army 
entered a political competition, and we weren't totally prepared." 
</P>
<P>
"Within Sandinismo, we militants became almost a sect. We didn't open up to 
outsiders," said Daniel Nunez, whose resume reflects the concentration of 
power. He heads the Sandinista farmers union and belongs to the lawmaking 
National Assembly and the party's 102-member Sandinista Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
A sign of the leadership's isolation appeared last Tuesday, when the Sandinista 
Assembly met in an air-conditioned auditorium to analyze the election while 
thousands of bitter supporters gathered outside. When the session ended, Ortega 
came out to speak, but most of the other leaders slipped out a back door and 
drove away in their cars. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview two days before the vote, Ortega acknowledged that some members 
of his government had become "too bureaucratic." But he insisted that his own 
style of leadership and politicking put him in "permanent conversation with all 
sectors of the population." Defeat, he said, was "inconceivable." 
</P>
<P>
The Ortega campaign portrayed revolutionary Nicaragua as different from the 
rest of Latin America, where incumbents are routinely turned out by voters 
protesting economic hard times. 
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua's economic devastation was the fault of the Contras, not the 
Sandinistas, Ortega insisted, and his real opponent was George Bush. Young 
voters who came of age during the revolution were behind him, he said. 
Sandinista polls proved it. So did the huge crowds delivered to glitzy 
Sandinista rallies in state-owned trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Sandinista officials now admit all these assumptions were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
They said they failed to understand the depth of opposition to compulsory 
military service, which turned the youth vote to Chamorro after she pledged to 
abolish the draft. Her coalition won in some Managua neighborhoods heavily 
populated by army personnel. 
</P>
<P>
One presidential aide said the Sandinistas learned too late that some of the 
200,000 to 300,000 people who attended their final rally Feb. 21 had come 
expecting Ortega to announce an end to the draft and left disappointed. He said 
Ortega weighed such a move but never acted. 
</P>
<P>
"The military service helped us win the war, but it helped UNO win the 
election," Nunez said. 
</P>
<P>
By massively outspending UNO, distributing thousands of "Daniel for President" 
T-shirts and caps and plastering his image on billboards across the country, 
the Sandinistas might have alienated poor voters who viewed the campaign as a 
waste of money. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a serious mistake for the Sandinistas to overwhelm people with 
propaganda," said Xabier Gorostiaga, a political analyst close to the 
Sandinistas. "It created a feeling of arrogance. This country doesn't ever 
accept arrogance." 
</P>
<P>
The Sandinistas said they were also misled by independent opinion polls that 
echoed their own private surveys. At least three outside polls taken in the 
last month of the campaign showed Ortega winning by 16 to 24 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
All the polls agreed that hard-core Sandinistas made up about 40% of the 
electorate, but most erred in calculating which way the large bloc of voters 
who called themselves undecided was leaning. 
</P>
<P>
Marvin Ortega, who conducted surveys for the Nicaraguan firm Itztani, said he 
and other pollsters underestimated how much fear the Sandinistas had instilled 
among Nicaraguans. He said many voters thought his pollsters were Sandinistas 
and mouthed support for Ortega, then voted against him. 
</P>
<P>
"The people were tired of repression and attempts to control their lives," 
Marvin Ortega said. "I don't believe they voted with their stomachs. They are 
politically proud. They voted with the desire to express an opinion." 
</P>
<P>
At the start of the revolution, the Sandinistas pushed Nicaraguans to join 
neighborhood defense committees, agricultural cooperatives and the Sandinista 
militia. They imposed price controls on farmers and forced them to sell their 
crops to the state. 
</P>
<P>
The government reversed most of these unpopular policies. But resentment 
lingered, and the party continued to make mistakes, such as assigning officials 
to govern regions they knew little about. "They didn't know the idiosyncrasies 
of the area, and they would try to impose their ideas," Nunez said. 
</P>
<P>
Sandinista loyalists have spent much of their time since last Sunday in 
meetings to analyze the election, maintain party morale and reform its 
structures. In a speech Tuesday, Ortega reminded thousands of loyalists that 
the front remains "the biggest, most solid and most organized party in the 
country" and vowed to "continue governing from below." 
</P>
<P>
Defeat is also forcing Sandinista leaders to re-examine what their party stands 
for. 
</P>
<P>
"We now have to ask what the revolution was," said Marenco. "We said we 
represented the people, but the people voted against us." 
</P>
<P>
Some Sandinistas say they are willing to help arrange a smooth transfer of 
power to Chamorro's 14-party coalition. Ortega has already named a transition 
team to negotiate with her representatives. 
</P>
<P>
Other party loyalists are adopting a militant opposition stance. They speak of 
setting up offices to help farmers defend their land in the event that UNO 
tries to return it to former owners who saw their property confiscated by the 
Sandinistas. Sandinista labor leaders are demanding emergency wage hikes when 
Chamorro takes office and threatening to cripple her government with strikes. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sandinista Front originated as a democratic centralist party, with some 
very undemocratic elements," said Robert Pastor, an adviser on Latin American 
affairs under former President Jimmy Carter and the chief of Carter's observer 
team here. "It has been transformed somewhat during this election campaign but 
not totally. The Sandinistas can make the country ungovernable if they want to, 
or they could be a constructive opposition." 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear which leaders will rise and which will fall in the party's 
internal restructuring. Ortega staked his personal prestige on winning the 
election but has shown no sign of retreating from an active party role. 
</P>
<P>
As a losing presidential candidate, Ortega is entitled by law to a seat in the 
91-member National Assembly. Whether or not he takes it, Carlos Nunez, the 
current assembly president, who was reelected to that body, will play a visible 
role in the Sandinista minority bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Humberto Ortega, the president's brother, and Interior 
Minister Tomas Borge, the sole surviving founder of the Sandinista Front, are 
expected to lose their posts as Chamorro tries to take control of the armed 
forces now under their command.

FEINSTEIN OPENS A BIG LEAD ON VAN DE KAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Capitalizing on charisma and beating her opponent on his own issues, Dianne 
Feinstein has opened up a 19-point lead over John K. Van de Kamp in their race 
for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, according to the Los Angeles Times 
Poll. 
</P>
<P>
The statewide survey shows Feinstein, with substantial help from women, running 
ahead of Van de Kamp by 43% to 24%. But 33% still are undecided with three 
months to go before the June primary. 
</P>
<P>
In a hypothetical November match-up with Republican Sen. Pete Wilson, Feinstein 
leads the prospective GOP nominee by 11 points -- 44% to 33% with 23% 
undecided. But Van de Kamp and Wilson are running essentially even -- Wilson 
33%, Van de Kamp 32%, with 35% undecided. 
</P>
<P>
Thought by many experts to be washed up politically only a few weeks ago, 
Feinstein was boosted by a strategically timed television commercial she ran in 
Southern California and the Central Valley during January and February, the 
poll showed. 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic commercial, the first run by any of this year's gubernatorial 
candidates, emphasized Feinstein's leadership as mayor of San Francisco after 
she succeeded the assassinated George Moscone. It concluded by noting that 
Feinstein has always been "pro-choice" on abortion and is "the only Democrat 
for governor for the death penalty." 
</P>
<P>
The 30-second TV spot used buzzwords and themes that clearly aroused the 
interest of voters, the poll illustrated. California Democrats, interviews 
showed, "favor" abortion by 2 to 1 and the death penalty by 3 1/2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
The dilemma for Atty. Gen. Van de Kamp is that -- unlike Feinstein -- he 
personally opposes abortion, although he joins her in supporting abortion 
rights. Likewise, he personally opposes capital punishment, although he 
promises that as governor he would not block executions. These conflicts 
between personal beliefs and public positions confuse many voters and make them 
suspicious, the poll indicated. 
</P>
<P>
One-third of the Democrats and half the Republicans polled said they are less 
likely to vote for Van de Kamp because of his personal view on capital 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
But some of the worst news for Van de Kamp in the poll involves two issues that 
he has carved out as his own: the environment and government ethics. When 
Democratic voters were asked which candidate "would do the best job" on the 
environment, Feinstein was chosen over Van de Kamp by 2 1/2 to 1. Similarly, 3 
1/2 times as many voters thought she would be better at handling government 
ethics. 
</P>
<P>
Either Van de Kamp is not getting his message across or voters are ignoring it, 
the survey indicated. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, there is strong evidence that voters at this relatively early 
stage of the race are choosing up sides based not on the issues, but on 
personal qualities. For example, nearly four times as many Democrats felt that 
Feinstein, rather than Van de Kamp, "is the most dynamic" and "relates best to 
people." And more than twice as many believed she "has the strongest 
convictions," "is the most dependable" and "has the most vision." 
</P>
<P>
The telephone survey of 2,058 California adults was conducted for six days, 
ending Thursday night -- a period in which Van de Kamp should have been running 
at maximum strength because he was touring the state formally kicking off his 
campaign and generating a lot of news coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Among those interviewed were 1,573 registered voters, including 742 Democrats, 
638 Republicans, 166 independents and some members of minor parties. The 
margins of error for the total sample and registered voters are three points in 
either direction. For the Democrats and Republicans separately the error 
margins are four points. 
</P>
<P>
"At the present time, Mayor Feinstein is clearly perceived as the most 
attractive personality among the three major contenders for governor," Times 
Poll Director I. A. Lewis said. "That fact, along with Van de Kamp's apparent 
fragility on certain issues, has for the moment made her the front-runner for 
the Democratic nomination." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's emergence as the Democratic front-runner marks a stunning 
turnaround for a candidate who only last summer was accused by her former 
campaign manager of lacking spunk and energy. An October survey by the Times 
poll found her trailing Van de Kamp by 12 points, and an early December survey 
showed her lagging by 10. 
</P>
<P>
Now, it is hard to find any voter group that does not favor Feinstein, the 
first woman ever to become a major candidate for governor in California. Women 
support her strongly, by more than 2 to 1. But men also back her, though by a 
smaller margin, 4 to 3. 
</P>
<P>
Being a woman helps Feinstein in the Democratic primary for the simple reason 
that women greatly outnumber men in the party, 3 to 2. Three-fifths of her 
supporters are women. 
</P>
<P>
Among the entire electorate, however, women have only a slight edge in numbers. 
And in a contest with Republican Wilson, although women support Feinstein by 
nearly 2 to 1, she winds up leading the senator by just 11 points because men 
split their votes evenly. 
</P>
<P>
Geographically, Feinstein shows surprising strength even in Los Angeles County, 
where Van de Kamp served eight years as district attorney and his family is 
well known because of the bakery chain it founded. Trying to cut into Van de 
Kamp's Southern California base, the former San Francisco mayor moved into a 
rented Century City condominium last fall and -- more important -- poured 
roughly half a million dollars into buying TV commercial time in the Los 
Angeles market. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that Feinstein now is running even with Van de Kamp in Los 
Angeles County and leading him by 2 to 1 in the rest of Southern California. 
She leads by 5 to 1 in her native San Francisco Bay Area and 5 to 3 throughout 
the rest of Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein also leads big among management and union members, liberals and 
moderates, Protestants and Catholics, high school and college graduates, the 
young and the old. 
</P>
<P>
The Times poll also sought to learn how the overall electorate feels generally 
about the three major gubernatorial candidates, regardless of any primary or 
general election match-ups. So all registered voters in the survey were asked 
who they "would like to see as governor" -- Feinstein, Van de Kamp or Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
The response was a virtual tie between Feinstein and Wilson, with each 
candidate drawing twice as much support as Van de Kamp. The reason Feinstein 
runs only even with Wilson in this three-way exercise, but beats him by 11 
points in a more realistic two-way match-up, is that inserting Van de Kamp into 
the mix splits the Democratic vote. 
</P>
<P>
The poll found a surprising lack of voter knowledge about Wilson, despite the 
fact that he has been a U.S. senator for seven years and is now running in his 
fourth statewide race in a dozen years. Nearly half the voters did not know 
enough about him to say whether they approve or disapprove "of the way he is 
handling his job as senator." Among the rest, his performance is approved by 3 
to 2. 
</P>
<P>
In the three-way mix of candidates, Feinstein is considered the one who "best 
represents change" from the Deukmejian Administration. Wilson is regarded as 
"the best example of business as usual" and the one "most identified with the 
political Establishment as the 'insider.' " Van de Kamp is thought to have "the 
poorest judgment" -- perhaps because of the "Hillside Strangler" case. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, when interviewed, nearly two-thirds of the voters said they had not 
heard enough about the 1981 case to approve or disapprove of the way Van de 
Kamp handled it as district attorney. But then voters were informed that "Van 
de Kamp decided to prosecute Angelo Buono, one of the 'Hillside Strangler' 
defendants, only on sex charges because he thought there was not enough 
evidence to convict him of murder. But the judge refused to accept this 
decision and gave the case instead to state authorities, who then gained a 
murder conviction." 
</P>
<P>
After being reminded of this information -- as voters undoubtedly will be, 
repeatedly, by Van de Kamp's opponents this election year -- nearly four in 10 
Democrats said his handling of the case makes them "less likely" to support him 
for governor. 
</P>
<P>
Among the three candidates, Wilson -- a strong supporter of capital punishment 
-- was judged to be the one who "would do the best job as far as the death 
penalty is concerned." Feinstein was a close second. But Van de Kamp, 
presumably because of his long career in law enforcement, was considered to be 
the candidate who would do the best overall job on crime. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp has concentrated a substantial amount of his time and money on 
efforts to qualify three initiatives for the November ballot -- sweeping 
proposals dealing with crime, the environment and government ethics. They make 
up the core of his gubernatorial campaign. But so far this strategy seems to 
have netted him little politically. 
</P>
<P>
In the three-way candidate mix, Feinstein is considered by voters to be "the 
best" on the environment and government ethics, followed in each case by 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
According to this survey, however, Feinstein's strongest issues are health and 
education, two topics that traditionally have worked well for women candidates. 
She also is considered to be the best on the abortion issue. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence that Feinstein got a lot of mileage from her TV commercials was found 
when interviewers asked voters whether they recalled seeing it. One-fourth of 
the Democrats said they had seen the ad. And among these people, Feinstein is 
favored by a 32-point margin. Among those who did not catch the commercial, she 
is favored by 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
The former mayor appears to be vulnerable on at least one aspect of her past -- 
leaving San Francisco's city government with a $180-million deficit. Three in 
10 Democrats -- and more than four in 10 Republicans -- said this fact makes 
them "less likely" to vote for her. 
</P>
<P>
Among all voters, Feinstein also was judged to be "the least knowledgeable." 
</P>
<P>
There definitely is an environmental constituency out there for politicians to 
tap, the survey showed. More than half the voters -- especially Democrats -- 
said "the quality of life in California has declined" in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
Roughly a third of the voters said that "fruits and vegetables are contaminated 
with pesticides." More than half -- including voters in the crop-rich Central 
Valley -- thought "there should be a temporary halt" to anti-Medfly spraying in 
Southern California until "more research can be done on the harmful effects of 
malathion." 
</P>
<P>
Six in 10 of those polled disapproved of oil drilling off the California coast.

GOVERNOR SIGNS BILL FOR DELAY IN BUYING GUNS 
</P>

<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian, whose hard-core opposition to gun controls helped get 
him elected, on Saturday signed legislation making California the nation's 
first state to impose a 15-day waiting period on the purchase of recreational 
rifles and shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
Using a phrase reserved for his own pet political initiatives, the Republican 
chief executive termed the Democrat-authored bill a "common sense approach" to 
deal with criminals and the mentally unstable. 
</P>
<P>
Partisans on both sides of the issue agreed that the legislation will be more 
far-reaching than the ban on assault weapons, which was enacted last year, 
because the new law will affect millions of ordinary Californians who buy 
firearms for sporting purposes or self-protection. 
</P>
<P>
Elated gun control advocates forecast that the action by Deukmejian and the 
California Legislature will help overcome heavy resistance to pending federal 
gun control legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is going to provide the momentum we need to pass a sensible 
national gun policy," said Sarah Brady, chairwoman of Handgun Control Inc. 
"This enormous victory with such a comprehensive gun law is not going to be 
lost on lawmakers across the country, especially in an election year." 
</P>
<P>
But one top official of the National Rifle Assn., whose organization was first 
dealt a stunning defeat when California banned military-style assault weapons 
last year, sloughed off enactment of the 15-day waiting period bill as 
"irrelevant" elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't follow California in any knee-jerk reaction," said Richard 
Gardiner, Washington-based director of state and local lobbying for the NRA. 
"California passed the (assault gun) law, which Gov. Deukmejian signed, and not 
a single other state passed anything similar. Not one." 
</P>
<P>
Starting next Jan. 1, the bill by liberal Democratic Assemblyman Lloyd G. 
Connelly of Sacramento will extend to hunting rifles and shotguns the 15-day 
waiting period long required of handgun purchases. This will make 
over-the-counter and private sales of virtually all firearms subject to the 
delay while authorities run background checks on the purchasers. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, criminals involved in gun-related misdemeanors and dangerous 
persons involuntarily detained under existing law for 72-hour psychiatric 
examinations will be prohibited from buying shotguns and rifles for at least 
five or 10 years, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
"It will help save the lives of many innocent victims," Deukmejian said in his 
regular weekly radio broadcast. "And it represents a common sense approach to 
dealing with the criminal element in our society." 
</P>
<P>
Backers of the bill -- including police chiefs, sheriffs and rank-and-file 
officer organizations -- lobbied hard for the measure. They argued that a 
15-day wait would provide a "cooling off" period and help curb impulsive crimes 
of passion in which family members are often slain. 
</P>
<P>
It is not certain what effect the waiting period will have on gun sales before 
it goes into effect in 1991. Last year, gun stores were inundated by 
last-chance buyers shortly before the prohibition on assault weapons took 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
When he was elected to his first term as governor in 1982, Deukmejian was a 
longtime foe of new restrictions on firearms. He strongly sided with the NRA 
and other gun owner groups in opposing a gun control initiative on the same 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
That proposal, Proposition 15, would have required the registration of legally 
acquired handguns and prohibited most sales of additional new revolvers and 
pistols. Deukmejian's opponent, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, endorsed the 
initiative. Deukmejian narrowly defeated Bradley and the initiative lost by 
nearly a 2-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts have credited Deukmejian's opposition to Proposition 15 and the 
support he received from gun owners for his own election victory. But last 
year, he shocked both sides by coming out in favor of banning assault weapons 
and imposing a 15-day waiting period on long guns. 
</P>
<P>
Political intimates of the governor have said he was profoundly shaken by the 
1989 murders of five Southeast Asian refugee children in a Stockton elementary 
school yard by a deranged gunman, Patrick Purdy, who wounded 29 other children 
and a teacher. Reloading twice, Purdy sprayed at least 105 rounds from his 
legally purchased assault rifle into the children and then killed himself with 
a pistol, also lawfully obtained. 
</P>
<P>
Although voicing support for the "concept" of the Connelly bill, Deukmejian 
during the last two weeks sent puzzling and ambiguous signals about whether he 
would sign or veto it. The bill was Connelly 's first gun control measure and 
the lawmaker said Saturday that he lost sleep worrying about a veto. 
</P>
<P>
Connelly conceded that the new law will not come close to eliminating 
gun-related crimes in California, but based on experience, "we know for a hard 
fact that 10,000 folks who otherwise would purchase firearms will be precluded 
from doing so." 
</P>
<P>
State officials estimate that about 1 million background checks will be 
conducted annually on purchasers of long guns. Already, about 300,000 checks 
are run on handgun buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The NRA has argued that waiting periods for gun purchases inconvenience 
law-abiding citizens and do not work because criminals get firearms from 
illegal sources anyway. The NRA does, however, support proposed computerized 
"instant" background checks that would link gun sellers to police records. 
</P>
<P>
In his radio speech, Deukmejian said he will pursue unspecified legislation to 
automate the background checks, a proposal favored by Assembly Republicans and 
the NRA. 
</P>
<P>
The new law will roll back the waiting period for rifles and shotguns from 15 
to 10 days in 1996 in anticipation that an automated system in the state 
Department of Justice would be operational by then. 
</P>
<P>
Other gun bills are pending in the Legislature, but their future is uncertain. 
One would require prospective handgun purchasers to enroll in firearm safety 
classes, while the other would restrict the number of bullets in ammunition 
magazines to 15. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Judy, the NRA's California lobbyist, said polls showing public support 
for controls reflect a "lack of understanding of the issues and ramifications. 
We intend to start getting out our side of the story better than we have, raise 
the educational understanding and have an impact in the (1990) California 
elections." 
</P>
<P>
Relatively soon, Congress is expected to take up the so-called "Brady bill" to 
impose a nationwide seven-day waiting period on the purchase of handguns, and 
separate legislation to outlaw the domestic manufacture or sale of assault 
weapons or the importation of such arms. 
</P>
<P>
James Brady is the former White House press secretary who was severely wounded 
in the 1981 attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan. Brady and his 
wife Sarah, of Handgun Control, have made the bill's passage a personal cause.

DOCTORS CRITICIZE CALL FOR HALT TO SPRAYING; 
</P>
<P>
MEDFLY: A PROPOSED RESOLUTION BY THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSN. WOULD NEEDLESSLY 
ALARM THE PUBLIC, SOME SAY. 
</P>

<P>
A proposed California Medical Assn. resolution calling for the immediate halt 
to malathion spraying was criticized by doctors Saturday, some of whom said the 
measure would cause needless public alarm and "paranoia" over a pesticide they 
insist has been proven safe. 
</P>
<P>
The comments from nearly a dozen doctors attending the CMA's annual meeting in 
Anaheim at the Disneyland Hotel mark the first public opposition by members of 
the association to the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
The measure will likely go before CMA delegates for a full vote Tuesday, the 
day after a 26-square-mile section of Orange and Los Angeles counties is 
scheduled to be sprayed. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution, which alleges that the state has not proven the safety of the 
pesticide used in Mediterranean fruit fly eradication, was supported by two 
doctors at the CMA reference committee hearing. 
</P>
<P>
However, one by one, doctors from Orange County and around the state spoke out 
against the resolution, saying the chemical mixture used in the sprayings does 
not pose a health risk. 
</P>
<P>
"The malathion is extremely weak," said Kenneth Hayes, an association member 
from San Jose. "The CMA should not (get involved) in this mass hysteria." 
</P>
<P>
Several doctors noted that a series of studies found no long-term or short-term 
health hazards associated with normal exposure to the malathion mixture, which 
amounts to about 2.8 ounces of the pesticide per acre. The chemical can be 
toxic to some insects and fish, but state officials say it is not harmful to 
humans. 
</P>
<P>
"This issue has been discussed and decided," CMA member Roger Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
If the CMA wants to get involved in the issue, one doctor suggested, it should 
try to ease the public's fears about malathion by going on record as saying 
that the spraying doesn't pose a health risk. 
</P>
<P>
A similar approach was taken in 1981 in Santa Clara County when a local medical 
association cooperated with state officials in attempting to allay residents' 
fears about Medfly spraying. 
</P>
<P>
The CMA does not have a formal position on malathion. When Santa Clara County 
faced spraying, the association decided the issue was a "matter best addressed" 
by local doctors, according to a CMA staff report. 
</P>
<P>
"If the CMA takes action on this . . . it says the doctors of California 
believe (malathion) is unsafe," said Alvin Markovitz, a member of the committee 
that heard the testimony. ". . . It sends the message that malathion is 
dangerous and a poison." 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the resolution have said the spraying should be stopped until 
malathion's effects can be assessed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not our burden to show that it's not safe," said H. Rex Greene, the 
Pasadena doctor who introduced the resolution. "The state must prove that it's 
safe." 
</P>
<P>
Greene was joined by Jerome Marmorstein, chairman of the CMA's Committee on 
Environmental and Occupational Health. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not comfortable with it," Marmorstein said. "It's a flagrant violation of 
human rights to be (sprayed) when (people) don't want it." 
</P>
<P>
Some doctors agreed that even if the spraying is a social issue, the medical 
association should not try to halt the practice if a health risk can not be 
proven. 
</P>
<P>
The committee that heard testimony Saturday will likely recommend acceptance or 
rejection of the resolution when the measure is voted on by the 440-member 
House of Delegates later this week. The committee can also make changes in the 
statement, which calls on the 38,000 members of the association to write 
letters to state officials and lawmakers calling for a halt to spraying. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a top committee of CMA leaders agreed to let the resolution be 
discussed at the annual meeting. Officials believe the resolution is the first 
in the country to deal with malathion spraying. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution controversy comes on the eve of another round of spraying in 
portions of Brea, La Habra and Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Helicopters are scheduled to fly over the area for the sixth time starting at 9 
p.m. Monday, said Frank Parsons of the Orange County agriculture office. 
</P>
<P>
A 36-mile area around Garden Grove and Westminster is scheduled to be sprayed 
for the third time Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, spraying is scheduled Monday in the Irwindale, Glendora 
and Duarte areas, Tuesday in the Downey area, Wednesday in the South Gate area 
and Thursday in the Pomona area.

UC STUDENTS, POLICE WAGE PITCHED BATTLE; 8 HURT, 17 ARRESTED 
</P>

<P>
A violent melee between 50 police and more than 400 youths outside a 
controversial UC Berkeley housing facility early Saturday led to 17 arrests and 
left at least eight people hospitalized, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators sealed off a major street for three hours, lighting bonfires 
and throwing bricks and bottles at firefighters trying to put out the blazes. 
</P>
<P>
The five-hour confrontation began late Friday night when club-wielding police 
tried to break up a party at Barrington Hall, a student-operated residence hall 
just south of the campus. 
</P>
<P>
The police action occurred after the building's owner, the student-run 
University Students Cooperative Assn., received an injunction Friday to bar any 
public gatherings in the building. The association's membership voted last fall 
to close Barrington Hall, which has a history of illegal drug use and neighbor 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
George Proper, general manager of the association, feared that the party would 
lead to vandalism. Friday's injunction prohibits the Barrington residents from 
having any guests. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the 180-room building said they were having a private party and 
were not disturbing anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just reading poetry and enjoying some quiet music. We weren't causing 
any trouble," said junior Kibi Schultz. 
</P>
<P>
But when police arrived with Proper and asked the group to disperse, the mood 
quickly grew belligerent as students began banging pots and pans, and shouting 
obscenities at police. 
</P>
<P>
The 75 students who were driven out of the building gathered on Haste Street, 
about two blocks west of Telegraph Avenue. As they built barricades, lit fires 
and taunted police, the students were joined by many other young people from 
the largely student neighborhood four blocks south of the campus. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd swelled to about 350, and several demonstrators broke the windows out 
of a police car and attempted to set it on fire. 
</P>
<P>
Other students in the three-story building's upper floors threw desks, drawers 
and furniture out of their windows to help stoke the fires. 
</P>
<P>
Police formed lines on each end of the block and another in a parking lot 
across the street from Barrington. They held their ground for more than an hour 
and let the fires burn as high as 20 feet in the air. The students turned the 
event into a street party and danced around the barricades yelling obscenities 
and making obscene gestures at police. 
</P>
<P>
After the crowd thinned, police gradually moved forward and firefighters began 
hosing the flames, but they quickly retreated when they were met with volleys 
of rocks and bottles. Firefighters then sprayed demonstrators and the building. 
The confrontation remained in a stalemate for about an hour as police advanced, 
then retreated. 
</P>
<P>
After one firefighter was hit by a rock and fell off a firetruck, students 
surged forward. The police charged to meet them, chasing students into the 
building and hitting many of them with clubs. 
</P>
<P>
After getting reinforcements, the police combed the dormitory room by room, 
knocking down some doors with fire axes and driving students out of the 
building. More than a dozen students said afterward that they were forced to 
"run the gantlet" through club-wielding police. 
</P>
<P>
The police stood guard and would not let any of the students return to the 
building, although some students stood in the street outside Barrington 
taunting them until about 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Six students, one firefighter and one police officer were hospitalized and 
later released. Ten police and several firefighters were treated for minor 
injuries. Dozens of students also sustained minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"This didn't need to happen; they (police) were incredibly violent," said 
junior Eugene Perez as he held a cloth to a bloody gash on the back of his 
head. "I'm beaten up and homeless -- and they accomplished nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Lt. William Pittman, who commanded the police, defended their action in the 
incident -- the fourth violent protest in Berkeley in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We were met with a great deal of violence and I feel we acted with restraint 
under these circumstances," he said.

ANTARCTIC TREK WITH SKIS, DOGS BREAKS RECORD; 
</P>
<P>
ADVENTURE: THE CROSSING BY AN INTERNATIONAL TEAM IS MEANT TO BUILD SUPPORT FOR 
PROTECTING THE CONTINENT FROM DEVELOPMENT.

Six weary but jubilant adventurers from six nations completed a seven-month, 
3,800-mile trek across Antarctica on skis and dog sleds Saturday, in the 
longest unmechanized crossing of the continent. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a dangerous land, without mercy," co-leader Jean-Louis Etienne of France 
said moments after the team arrived at a Soviet base on the Indian Ocean coast. 
</P>
<P>
The men were given a huge loaf of fresh bread and chugged champagne as the 
flags of their homelands flapped above them in a strong wind. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Etienne, the team included American co-leader Will Steger of Ely, 
Minn.; Victor Boyarsky of the Soviet Union; Geoff Somers of Britain; Quin Dahe 
of China, and Keizo Funatsu of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Interviewed on ABC-TV's "Wide World of Sports," Steger was asked what he 
intends to do now that the journey has ended. He laughed and said: "Take a 
sauna." 
</P>
<P>
"We can relax and join the human race again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Minnesota-based expedition almost ended in tragedy in its final hours. As 
the team struggled through a storm toward the Soviet research base of Mirnyy, 
Funatsu disappeared in a blizzard for 11 hours before he was found Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Steger said it was "very close. We were lucky we found him." 
</P>
<P>
The crossing was by far the longest of its type across Antarctica, but 
apparently not the first without motor power. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 12, Italian mountaineer Reinhold Messner and West German adventurer 
Arved Fuchs completed what they said was a 1,700-mile crossing on foot, without 
the use of sled dogs. They are expected to arrive in Frankfurt later this month 
to provide details of their journey. 
</P>
<P>
Etienne's team is scheduled to return to France for welcoming celebrations 
March 21. They then head to the United States for ceremonies in Minneapolis -- 
which along with Paris served as expedition headquarters -- and in Washington, 
where President Bush is expected to meet them at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, in a congratulatory message, said: "Your spirit of international 
friendship and cooperation not only helped make this fantastic journey possible 
but also set a wonderful example for the world community of nations." 
</P>
<P>
The expedition, undertaken at a cost of about $11 million after three years of 
planning, was intended to build support for Antarctica's preservation and 
demonstrate the power of international cooperation. The members had their 
expenses paid, but they received no salaries. 
</P>
<P>
"Antarctica isn't threatened by pollution, it's still virgin and white," 
Etienne said in a hookup with reporters in Paris. "All countries should forget 
their partisan interests and offer it to the world. . . . This continent 
belongs to everyone." 
</P>
<P>
He described Antarctica as "huge and sometimes monstrous." In seven months, he 
said, the only other living things seen by the team were their sled dogs and 
three birds. 
</P>
<P>
Experts at expedition headquarters in Paris praised the performance of the sled 
dogs, which were trained by Steger. All but one of the 36 dogs used on the 
expedition survived, and a special high-nutrition diet appeared to have kept 
them in excellent health. 
</P>
<P>
The journey began July 28 near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, which 
reaches out toward South America. On Dec. 11, the team reached its halfway 
point, becoming the first to reach the South Pole by dog sled since Roald 
Amundsen in 1911. 
</P>
<P>
"The first two months were very, very hard," Etienne said. "We started to doubt 
after a month whether we would make it." 
</P>
<P>
It had been feared bad weather might strand the adventurers on the continent 
for as long as a month and jeopardize an elaborate international tour to tout 
the expedition. 
</P>
<P>
But high winds pushed apart ice that had blocked the Mirnyy harbor, leaving a 
path for a ship that will take them to New Zealand. Soviet Antarctic officials 
in Leningrad told Cathy DeMoll, the expedition's manager in Paris, that unless 
conditions change, loading of the ship will begin Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The wind was howling at 70 m.p.h. and the temperature was 20 degrees below zero 
when Funatsu went outside his tent, a spokeswoman in Minnesota said. 
</P>
<P>
When Funatsu did not arrive back in his tent for dinner, team members tied 
themselves together and searched the area for several hours before giving up 
because of darkness. The search resumed early Friday, and Funatsu was found 
about two hours later, expedition staff reported. 
</P>
<P>
Etienne said that when expedition members passed Funatsu calling "Keizo! Keizo! 
Keizo!" he "jumped out like a mushroom from the snow. He was in very good 
shape." 
</P>
<P>
"He had survived by digging a hole in the snow and crawling inside, just as the 
dogs do each night to stay warm," the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>

Thousands of workers at some of Hawaii's biggest hotels walked off the job 
Saturday, leaving some guests without fresh sheets and towels and otherwise 
disrupting the state's $6-billion-a-year tourist industry. 
</P>
<P>
Many hotels were forced to cut back on meal and room services as managers 
scrambled to take the places of strikers. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the hotel industry said the Hotel Employees and Restaurant 
Employees Union had rejected a four-year contract that called for annual wage 
increases of 5% plus hikes in benefits that boosted the total package to around 
7%. 
</P>
<P>
However, a union spokesman calculated the management proposal at about 4%.

BUSH DIPLOMATIC STYLE: 'LAID BACK'

RANCHO MIRAGE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Diplomacy, as offered by George Bush: Come on over. Informal. Talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
That diplomacy, in a style unique to the man conducting it, is coming out of 
the White House these days in staccato maxi-bursts that mimic the monologues -- 
the verbal shards of thought, they've been called -- of the President himself. 
</P>
<P>
Helmut Kohl? Up to Camp David. 
</P>
<P>
Toshiki Kaifu? How about next weekend? Meet in Rancho Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
Every day, it seems, brings a new example of the way this President -- the man 
who took Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to opening day at Baltimore's 
Memorial Stadium to watch the Orioles and Red Sox -- likes to run his White 
House, the nation's foreign policy, and even his leisure time. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, they all came together in a sand-trap summit. 
</P>
<P>
That is why Toshiki Kaifu, a 59-year-old Japanese politician trying to ride the 
tiger of a surging Japan while balancing the demands of his own constituency 
and that of an increasingly wary United States, traveled more than 10 hours 
from Tokyo to find himself snaking along in an armor-plated Cadillac limousine 
between towering walls of hedges along streets named Frank Sinatra and Bob 
Hope. Waiting at the end of the ride through the desert was an informal dinner 
with Bush and senior aides. 
</P>
<P>
If there was anything atypical about this weekend's version of global Life with 
Poppy -- a one-time nickname of the President's -- it was the setting. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Walter H. Annenberg, the publishing magnate and former ambassador 
to Britain, has played host for years at his Sunnylands estate to Presidents 
(Nixon and Reagan, among them) and royalty (Queen Elizabeth II and Prince 
Charles, to name two), so there was nothing unusual about President Bush's 
coming out for the weekend or about Kaifu's having dinner there with the 
President. Nor, given Annenberg's hospitality for prime ministers and 
potentates and the extent of his desert domain, was there anything out of the 
ordinary in Bush's readiness to invite Kaifu to dinner at someone else's house. 
</P>
<P>
But Rancho Mirage, in general -- and a 32,600-square-foot home decorated with 
Cezannes, Van Goghs, Renoirs, a Rodin bronze of Eve and flowers from two 
greenhouses on the 250-acre property, in particular -- just don't have the 
flavor of the other presidential hangouts: Kennebunkport, Me., the prim, 
understated summer hometown of the Bush family diagonally across the continent; 
Beeville, Tex., the rough-edged South Texas town where a Bush buddy keeps a 
hunting ranch that the President visits each late December, or Islamorada, the 
little town in the Florida Keys where Bush likes to take up the challenge of 
reducing the Gulf of Mexico's population of the wily bonefish. 
</P>
<P>
No, this is much more of a resort -- a community where tennis and golf and spas 
are the raison d'etre; where people live, literally, on the grounds of their 
country clubs, like the Morningside Country Club where the Bush-Kaifu talks 
were held. In Rancho Mirage, garages have separate little doors for golf carts; 
the carts bear markings of prestige (reserved for Bush and Kaifu were identical 
carts with shiny grills that replicated the distinct front of a Rolls-Royce), 
and house guests, particularly visiting heads of state, don't have to share the 
bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The President's visit here was originally scheduled as a nearly 48-hour 
vacation at the end of two hectic travel days that included Republican 
fund-raising events -- lunch one day in Staten Island, N.Y., and dinner in San 
Francisco, in a typical Bush itinerary -- and four speeches in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of vacation, Bush spent Friday afternoon and evening with Kaifu, and 
met with him again Saturday morning and at lunch, after having awakened him in 
the middle of the night just a week earlier to invite him here. It wasn't until 
after Kaifu left that Bush had time for golf on Annenberg's private course. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Mirage is accustomed to such comings and goings, and appeared to take 
the 25-hour summit in stride. But in nearby Palm Springs, Mayor Sonny Bono 
pronounced the events "totally awesome," and his wife, Mary, was reported by 
the Desert Sun to have picked out the outfit she wore to await the arrival of 
Bush aboard Air Force One on Friday with an eye to coordinating her colors with 
that of the jet, which bears a distinctive Raymond Loewy design in blue, white 
and silver. 
</P>
<P>
For all the focus during the talks on the U.S.-Japanese relationship, an 
undercurrent was the U.S. public's view of that relationship. 
</P>
<P>
According to a New York Times/CBS News poll taken in January, one-quarter of 
those surveyed expressed "generally unfriendly" feelings about Japan, an 
increase from 19% last June and 8% in 1985.

And Bush went out of his way at a news conference overlooking the Morningside 
Country Club golf course after the talks to tell his American audience that his 
visitor's readiness to fly over to the United States at a relative moment's 
notice "should be interpreted in this manner: that the Japanese feel this 
relationship is very important."

SENATORS URGE NICARAGUA ARMS TURN-IN; 
</P>

CENTRAL AMERICA: DODD AND GRAMM AGREE THAT SURRENDER OF WEAPONS BY BOTH SIDES 
WILL PRESERVE THE PEACE -- AND PREVENT THE SALVADORAN CIVIL WAR FROM FLARING 
UP.

Two U.S. senators called on Nicaragua's Sandinista army and the Contra rebels 
Saturday to turn in their weapons to help preserve the peace in their own 
country and to prevent their arsenals from fueling the civil war in El 
Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Sens. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.) and Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) agreed in a broadcast 
interview that a rapid arms cleanup is necessary to safeguard the new civilian 
government of President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, who upset President 
Daniel Ortega at the polls last week. 
</P>
<P>
Former Contra leader Adolfo Calero and Assistant Secretary of State for Latin 
America Bernard Aronson, appearing on the same program as Dodd and Gramm, 
emphasized the need for government guarantees to ensure the peaceful 
integration of about 10,000 former guerrillas into Nicaraguan society. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd, chairman of a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on hemisphere 
affairs, and Gramm, a leading conservative, said that unless weapons in Central 
America's most heavily armed nation are carefully accounted for, they may find 
their way to El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
"Programs that have both the military and Contras turn in their weapons are 
very important," Gramm said on Cable News Network's "Newsmaker Saturday" 
program. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Salvadoran anti-government guerrillas have received major support 
from the Sandinistas. There have also been unconfirmed reports that despite 
their ideological differences, the U.S.-supplied Contras have sold weapons to 
the Salvadoran rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Although Contra leaders have refused to order their troops to turn in their 
weapons before the 70,000 soldiers of the Sandinista-controlled army are 
disarmed, Chamorro and President Bush have urged them to do so. Bush, in fact, 
differed publicly with former President Ronald Reagan over the issue during a 
meeting between the two in Los Angeles on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Shlaudeman, a retired U.S. ambassador to Brazil who now serves as a 
special State Department representative on Central American affairs, was in 
Tegucigalpa, Honduras, this weekend seeking to persuade Contra leaders to leave 
their Honduran camps. 
</P>
<P>
At one time, Reagan Administration officials had proposed offering U.S. refugee 
status to Contras. Dodd, however, discounted that possibility. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's going to be much appetite to come up with green cards," 
he said. "They've got to (go) back home." 
</P>
<P>
While both Dodd and Gramm warned of fiscal limitations on U.S. economic aid for 
Nicaragua, Aronson said the Administration wants to "move very quickly" on a 
support package similar to the assistance offered to Panama after the U.S. 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some immediate steps we're looking at," he said, citing removal of 
the trade embargo imposed by the Reagan Administration as one example. 
</P>
<P>
Aronson said he will meet Monday with Francisco Mayorga, Chamorro's chief 
economic adviser. On Friday, Mayorga said in Managua that the new government 
will ask for at least $300 million in U.S. aid. 
</P>
<P>
But Gramm warned that Washington cannot foot the entire bill. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear that we can't rebuild Nicaragua with American aid," declared the 
co-author of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction act. "I'd be willing 
to offer Nicaragua a free-trade agreement." 
</P>
<P>
One possible source of aid to Nicaragua was identified in a General Accounting 
Office report released Saturday by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.). The report 
said $685 million in aid to El Salvador has not been delivered, making it 
potentially available for other uses.

SHAMIR OK OF U.S. PEACE TALKS PLAN TOLD;

MIDEAST: ISRAELI TV SAYS ACCEPTANCE OF BAKER'S FORMULA ON PALESTINIAN 
DELEGATION COULD KEEP LABOR IN COALITION.

<P>
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has agreed to a compromise American formula for 
selecting a Palestinian panel to preliminary peace talks, Israeli Television 
reported Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Acceptance by Shamir and his rightist Likud Party could revive the stalled 
peace process and forestall a threat by the Labor Party, Likud's coalition 
partner, to bolt the unity government. 
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir will give a positive response to the American 
question on the composition of the Palestinian delegation, senior Likud and 
Labor sources said this evening," the television report said. 
</P>
<P>
The report was broadcast as Shamir and his loyal Cabinet ministers were 
discussing the deadlock at the prime minister's home. There was no immediate 
confirmation from the Likud leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Israeli Television) must know more than we do," declared Avi Pazner, 
Shamir's spokesman. "I don't understand on what they base their report." 
</P>
<P>
"We will see tomorrow (today)," when Shamir is scheduled to meet with Labor 
Party leaders, Pazner said. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli Army Radio, in a later broadcast, also said Shamir would propose 
acceptance of the American formula, a move bitterly opposed by the right wing 
of his party. The opponents, led by former Industry and Commerce Minister Ariel 
Sharon, reject any peace talks with Palestinians. Sharon's supporters in the 
Cabinet boycotted the Saturday night talks. 
</P>
<P>
The television report said Shamir's acceptance would be conditional on a pledge 
by the Labor Party to withdraw its threat to leave the coalition if the 
stalemate on the peace talks were not broken. "We have to make our national 
choice," Labor Party leader Shimon Peres said Friday, reasserting a Wednesday 
deadline for a decision. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the embattled prime minister agreed to accept a 
delegation to preliminary peace talks of Palestinians registered as residents 
of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Under the formula proposed by 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, that wording could include Palestinians 
who had been deported from the occupied territories and those who keep an 
apartment or office in East Jerusalem in addition to their home in the 
territories. 
</P>
<P>
But according to the television report, Shamir is accepting only the general 
wording "registered as residents," which may deflect some of the anticipated 
opposition from the Likud right wing, Jewish settlers in the occupied 
territories and other groups opposed to the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian delegation would be selected at a proposed Washington meeting 
of Baker, Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens and Egyptian Foreign Minister 
Esmat Abdel Meguid. The Egyptians would front for Yasser Arafat's Palestine 
Liberation Organization, with which the Israelis refuse to deal directly. 
Israel would retain the right to reject any Palestinian candidate, the 
television report said. 
</P>
<P>
Selection of the delegation would be the first step in a long process toward 
achieving a peace plan put forward by Shamir last April. The delegation would 
work out with the Israelis the procedures for a later election of Palestinian 
representatives. Talks between that group and the Israelis would determine the 
future status of the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
There have been no official talks between Israelis and Palestinians for more 
than 20 years, since Israel conquered the occupied territories in the 1967 
Arab-Israeli War. 
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting of the so-called Forum of Four -- Shamir and Arens for Likud 
and Deputy Prime Minister Peres and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin for Labor -- 
will set the stage for a full Cabinet meeting on the peace talks issue 
Wednesday. If the American formula is accepted by the Cabinet, Baker is 
expected to issue invitations for the Washington meeting, putting the peace 
process back on the rails. 
</P>
<P>
The PLO has insisted, among other things, that the Palestinian delegation 
include representatives from East Jerusalem, which was annexed by Israel after 
the 1967 war. That issue has become the most explosive on the tortuous path to 
the talks. Israeli rightists insist that including East Jerusalem Palestinians 
in the delegation would raise questions about the legitimacy of the annexation. 
</P>
<P>
Another longstanding PLO demand calls for the establishment of a Palestinian 
state in the occupied territories, opposed by politicians in both Likud and 
Labor. 
</P>
<P>
The television report made no mention of the agenda of the proposed Washington 
talks, beyond selection of the Palestinian delegation. The PLO has called for 
an open-ended discussion of all issues once the Palestinian representatives are 
chosen and sit down with their Israeli counterparts in what would be the first 
meeting of the opposing sides on the confrontation that has racked the Middle 
East for decades. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, asked about the report from Israel, said, "We have been working 
on this for eight months." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference in California after his summit meeting with 
Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, Bush said he had no details, but "I hope 
it's true and I hope we can move forward." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether progress had actually been made, he said, "Well, there has over 
the months. But just like the real world, you take two steps forward and take 
one step back. I hope we're going to go forward now."

BOMB INJURES 16 AMERICAN SERVICEMEN IN PANAMA BAR 
</P>

PANAMA CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bomb tossed through the window of a downtown discotheque wounded 16 American 
servicemen, one seriously, military and hospital officials said Saturday. 
Eleven Panamanians were also hurt. 
</P>
<P>
It is believed to be the first such attack on U.S. servicemen since the United 
States invaded Panama on Dec. 20 and overthrew the government of Gen. Manuel A. 
Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Two victims of the blast quoted witnesses of the attack late Friday at the My 
Place nightclub as saying the attacker shouted "Viva Noriega!" just before 
throwing a bomb through the door and fleeing in a waiting car. Others said they 
did not hear the shout. 
</P>
<P>
The attack came three days after U.S. military and civilian personnel were 
allowed to visit bars and nightclubs for the first time since the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Southern Command said that no one had claimed responsibility for the 
blast and that there was no known motive. 
</P>
<P>
Panama's Judicial Technical Police, in charge of the investigation, gave no 
details, but an official said "it was against the gringos." 
</P>
<P>
But Lt. Col. Terry Jones, a Southern Command spokesman, said, "We don't know 
what it was. They're investigating that it's possible it could have been a 
grenade." 
</P>
<P>
Panama has been largely free of anti-American incidents since the invasion. But 
the city has experienced an increase in violent crime, and the senior financial 
officer of the Panama Canal Commission was gunned down in his home Jan. 23 
during a robbery. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told Cable News Network that two 
grenades may have been thrown into the building from passing cars, but Jones 
said only one explosive was hurled. 
</P>
<P>
The injuries apparently were caused by the explosion and by flying glass from 
broken windows, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
The wounded servicemen were taken to the U.S. military's Gorgas Hospital. One 
was in serious condition, 13 were hospitalized in stable condition, and two 
were released by Saturday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Six of the 11 Panamanians wounded were treated and released at Panama City 
hospitals. One underwent surgery, and four were kept for observation. Most 
suffered wounds in the legs and feet, hospital records indicated. 
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred hours after Noriega's wife, three daughters and grandson 
left Panama for Havana. As they left Panama City, they were surrounded by 
hundreds of jeering people who shouted "Go away, beggars!"

REMAP TRIAL COST SOARS -- AND IT ISN'T OVER; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: L.A. COUNTY HAS ALREADY SPENT $3 MILLION AND COULD BE LIABLE FOR THE 
PLAINTIFFS' COSTS IF IT LOSES. DECISION COULD COME SOON. 
</P>

<P>
A historic redistricting trial that could reshape the political landscape of 
Los Angeles County already has cost taxpayers $3 million, largely for legal 
fees paid to outside lawyers, according to the county counsel's office. 
</P>
<P>
And if the county loses the voting rights lawsuit, it could be liable for the 
bill run up by the plaintiffs -- now about $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
County attorneys defend the spending as necessary to keep local officials in 
charge of redistricting rather than ceding jurisdiction to the U.S. Justice 
Department, one of the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
"There is quite a lot at stake," said John McDermott, whose law firm has been 
paid more than $1.5 million to defend the county. "Who is it who is going to 
decide the future of county government?" 
</P>
<P>
Mark Rosenbaum, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, one of the 
plaintiffs, said the supervisors are interested only in protecting their jobs 
at any cost. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of keeping five white supervisors in office, the sky's the limit," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The suit accuses the supervisors of splintering the county's 3 million Latinos 
among three districts, weakening their political influence in violation of the 
U.S. Voting Rights Act. It seeks to create a predominantly Latino district, 
from which a Latino would have an improved chance of winning a seat on the 
county board. 
</P>
<P>
The trial, under way since early January, is expected to end in a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department officials said they have not calculated how much the trial 
has cost. The federal government has at least six attorneys assigned to the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, another 
plaintiff, are expect to spend about $2 million on attorneys' fees alone. 
</P>
<P>
Ramona Ripston, executive director of the ACLU Foundation of Southern 
California, said the redistricting case is the most costly in the local 
chapter's history, exceeding even the lengthy litigation over school 
desegregation in Los Angeles in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The county's redistricting trial expenses are coming from a $36-million fund, 
set aside each year by the supervisors to pay for legal expenses, including 
settlement of lawsuits. As a result, no cuts in services are required, said 
Chief Administrative Officer Richard B. Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
No one is predicting what the case ultimately will cost the county. County 
lawyers have vowed to appeal, at least to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of 
Appeals, if they lose in district court. 
</P>
<P>
One of the big expenses, after attorneys' fees, has been for photocopying of 
the thousands of pages of exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
"Too many exhibits," lamented U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon, who says 
that the historic redistricting trial has produced more paper work than any 
other case before him in 10 years on the federal bench. "It's very hard to keep 
order up here," the judge said, looking out at boxes full of documents 
scattered haphazardly throughout the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
County attorney Richard Simon, pointing to a stack of files, said: "There is 
stuff in there relating to redistricting in South Carolina in 1867." The 
exhibit was used by the plaintiffs to equate the county's 1981 redistricting 
with the anti-black gerrymandering in the Deep South after the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
Costs have been high because both sides have taken more than 160 depositions 
from county officials and redistricting experts. Both sides also have hired 
"expert witnesses," including teams of demographers, historians, political 
scientists and statisticians. 
</P>
<P>
The demographers have drawn up maps and testified in court on how a district 
with a majority of Latino voters can or cannot be created. Recently pollster 
Mervin Field was called to testify as a county witness. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs must prove that it is possible to carve out a district with a 
majority of Latino voters. County attorneys contend that such a district could 
not be created during the 1981 redistricting -- or today -- because many 
Latinos are not citizens or old enough to vote. 
</P>
<P>
A Caltech history professor hired by the plaintiffs submitted to the judge a 
95-page report on county redistricting from 1959 to 1989. Other historians have 
testified about the history of discrimination against Latinos in California. 
Among the factors for determining a violation of the Voting Rights Act is 
whether there has been a history of discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
The legal costs come at a time when county services have been cut because of 
tight budgets. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors last fall closed two county mental health centers and cut funding 
to seven others because of a $3-million budget shortage. The board also voted 
down a $2.6-million appropriation to provide cost-of-living increases to 50,000 
welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
Though the county has its own lawyers on staff, the supervisors hired the 
Century City law firm of McDermott, Will &amp; Emery for the redistricting 
trial because of its success in winning reapportionment cases. McDermott 
receives $245 an hour from the county. 
</P>
<P>
For the ACLU and MALDEF, the case has been among their costliest. But not for 
the county, which spent $13.8 million to fight lawsuits brought by owners of 
property damaged in Malibu's Big Rock Mesa landslide in 1983, according to the 
county counsel's office. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether the five supervisors are fiscal conservatives or not depends on 
whether the question is prenatal care for poor mothers or preserving their 
white incumbencies," the ACLU's Rosenbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
But County Counsel DeWitt Clinton said the board is seeking to preserve home 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
"Ought not your elected representatives be able to determine how the county 
should be divided, and how the government should be run?" Clinton said. "Or 
ought it be decided by career officers in the U.S. Justice Department?" 
</P>
<P>
McDermott added that if the county chose not to fight, hundreds of thousands of 
county residents could be assigned supervisors whom they did not elect and who 
are unfamiliar with their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Mike Antonovich blamed the plaintiffs for the costs. "The cost of 
seeking justice and fair play for all Los Angeles taxpayers is the result of a 
naked power grab by the ACLU and MALDEF," Antonovich said. 
</P>
<P>
Simon said the county incurred costs in responding to the plaintiffs' demands 
for county records. 
</P>
<P>
"We provided to them over 110,000 pages of documents," Simon said, adding that 
every page was reviewed by an attorney before it was turned over to the 
plaintiffs. "The plaintiffs gave us about 30,000 pages of documents to review." 
</P>
<P>
The case has exacted a cost of another kind. Pointing out that he has worked on 
the case every day for more than a year, Rosenbaum quipped: "The rumor in my 
household is I've had a child, but I haven't been able to confirm it." His wife 
brought the baby to court last month.

FUGITIVE IN SHOOTING OF 2 DEAF MEN HELD IN N.Y. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joey Paul Bellinger -- the fugitive 16-year-old Long Beach youth charged last 
month with killing one deaf man and attempting to kill a second in a roadside 
confrontation in Granada Hills -- was arrested in central New York, authorities 
said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Bellinger -- who was described by police as an associate of a West Los 
Angeles-based skinhead gang -- was arraigned and held without bail Saturday at 
the Oneida County Correctional Facility in Oriskany, N.Y., said Sgt. Phil 
Brockway of the Oneida County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Department Detective Mitch Robins, who worked on the case 
with New York investigators, was en route to New York on Saturday to 
participate in extradition proceedings against Bellinger, which are scheduled 
for early this week, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Bellinger was taken into custody without incident at an acquaintance's house 
around 11:50 p.m. Friday in Cassville, a village in the town of Paris, Brockway 
said. He was arrested by FBI agents working out of the Utica office, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The teen had been sought as the alleged gunman in the Jan. 28 shooting of two 
brothers, Cesar and Edward Vieira, both of Palmdale. Cesar Vieira, 30, died the 
following day of chest wounds. Edward Vieira, 25, is still recovering from 
wounds to his hip and shoulder, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Bellinger was riding in a car with four friends when they pulled up next to the 
Vieira brothers, who were on a motorcycle at the intersection of Devonshire 
Street and Balboa Boulevard, police said. After a "stare-down contest" between 
the occupants of the car and the two brothers, the vehicles pulled into a 
nearby parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers -- who had limited speaking skills and usually communicated 
through sign language -- were apparently unable to understand what was 
happening, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The Vieira brothers' mother, Bernice Cree, said Saturday from her home in 
Reseda that she was relieved with Bellinger's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God he's been caught," Cree said. "I hope he is punished as a man, and 
not as a juvenile. Now I can go to bed and sleep, because I haven't had a good 
night's sleep since this happened." 
</P>
<P>
Police charged Bellinger with the shooting after two teen-agers who were riding 
in the car talked to authorities. Those teens were not charged in the case. 
</P>
<P>
At first, investigators thought that Bellinger had been staying with friends in 
the Hollywood-Fairfax area. He had left his Long Beach home about seven months 
earlier, they said. 
</P>
<P>
A federal warrant for his arrest was issued Feb. 12 after FBI authorities 
determined that Bellinger had friends and relatives living in Utica, and had 
apparently traveled there, an FBI spokesman said. The warrant charged Bellinger 
with unlawful interstate flight to escape prosecution, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Brockway said a tip provided to the FBI led to Bellinger's whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
Bellinger was living with Susan Alguire, who said in an interview with the 
Utica Observer-Dispatch that she provided the youth with room and board at the 
request of his mother, a high school friend. "She didn't say, 'I want you to 
hide my son,' " Alguire said. "I'm in shock." 
</P>
<P>
Alguire said that Bellinger's mother, Phyllis Bellinger, said that she and her 
husband were planning to move back to New York to live. 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis Bellinger could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Bellinger was brought before U.S. District Magistrate Gustave J. DiBianco on 
Saturday. At the hearing, an assistant U.S. attorney asked the court to turn 
Bellinger over to the Oneida Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
He was then taken before New Hartford Justice James Van Slyke and was charged 
with being a fugitive from justice, Brockway said, and then sent to the County 
Jail. 
</P>
<P>
During the court proceedings, Bellinger "did say he desires to return to 
California," Brockway said.

TWO NICARAGUA FACTIONS IN L.A. PLEDGE TO UNITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Nicaraguans living in Los Angeles pledged to put their political differences 
aside and "become one people again" during two separate rallies Saturday -- one 
celebrating the recent victory at the polls of President-elect Violeta Barrios 
de Chamorro and another mourning the defeat of Nicaraguan President Daniel 
Ortega. 
</P>
<P>
"We want unity and peace, not war," said a tearful Kenia Chamorro while leaving 
St. Vincent's Catholic Church in Los Angeles, where about 250 people gathered 
to celebrate a noon Mass in honor of the recent election victory in Nicaragua 
of the National Opposition Union (UNO). 
</P>
<P>
The need for peace was also expressed at a pro-Sandinista rally at USC's 
Davidson Conference Center Saturday night where about 300 participants cheered 
and applauded when several speakers mentioned the possible end of the 10 years 
of civil war in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure we are disappointed with the Sandinistas' defeat, but what's more 
important is to put an end to the blood bath," said Ramon Diaz, a native of 
Nicaragua who is also a member of the Nicaraguan Cultural Center, a 
pro-Sandinista Organization in Los Angeles. "We want to become one people again 
to help Nicaragua blossom and grow to be strong." 
</P>
<P>
But Lydia Brazon of the Nicaraguan Elections Information Project, the 
organization that sponsored the pro-Sandinista rally, said the wounds between 
supporters of the right and the left wing would take much time to heal. 
</P>
<P>
"The intensity of the hatred is appalling," said Brazon, whose parents are 
Nicaraguan. "Entire families are divided. People need time to forget their 
political differences and come together." 
</P>
<P>
Most speakers at the pro-Sandinista rally steered away from criticism of the 
victorious UNO party, but they did criticize U.S. actions in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Speakers accused the United States of buying votes for the UNO party by 
promising to stop sending aid to the Contras and to lift trade sanctions if 
Chamorro won. 
</P>
<P>
An address from Nicaragua by Ortega was supposed to have been transmitted by 
satellite to the rallies in Los Angeles and 55 other U.S. cities. But technical 
problems prevented that from happening. Organizers said they suspect that the 
anti-Sandinista U.S. government somehow blocked the transmission. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, participants in the pro-Chamorro Mass and rally had nothing 
but praise for U.S. actions. 
</P>
<P>
"God bless Violeta Chamorro. God bless Oliver North. God bless President 
Reagan," the demonstrators repeatedly shouted at a rally in MacArthur Park. 
</P>
<P>
The same cheers could be heard as Chamorro supporters made their way from the 
church to the park three miles away in a caravan of cars adorned with 
Nicaraguan flags. 
</P>
<P>
Some onlookers made thumbs-down motions at the procession of about 50 cars, and 
a driver in a pickup truck shouted in a thick accent, "Vivan Los Sandinistas." 
</P>
<P>
At a rally in MacArthur park, the crowd shouted, whistled and rejoiced as 
speakers addressed them in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
"No more pain. No more war. No more separation my fellow Nicaraguans," 
organizer Cesar A. Aviles declared. Aviles, director of the Nicaraguan 
Patriotic Coalition in Los Angeles, added it was important that Nicaraguans put 
politics aside and unite. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no words to describe the happiness we feel as a people," Adam 
Torres, one of the participants, said. "Nicaragua is free. We have been 
liberated. Much of it, thanks to the Americans." 
</P>
<P>
Torres, who immigrated to the United States in 1979, said many exiled 
Nicaraguans plan to return to their homeland if there is a smooth transition of 
power from Ortega's administration to Chamorro's. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all brothers," he said. "We can't let hatred get between us. There will 
soon be peace in our country, I hope that will also bring peace to our hearts."

TEENS GET QUANTUM PEEP AT CALTECH; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: ABOUT 90 JUNIOR AND SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS HAVE A FIELD DAY 
WITH PHYSICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Try spending a pleasant Saturday figuring out the inner volume of a glass jar. 
You can use a roll of string, a couple of weights, two stopwatches, a physics 
book and a pair of scissors. You have 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Stumped? Then try this one: If a ball was dropped from a table that is 19.6 
meters above the floor, how long does it take for the ball to reach the floor? 
We'll give you a hint: G equals 9.8m/sec, V initial equals 0 m/s. 
</P>
<P>
This is not stuff for the faint of heart or weak of mind. But for 90 junior and 
senior high school students who turned out at Caltech in Pasadena on Saturday 
for Science Field Day, it was just another walk in the park. 
</P>
<P>
"These aren't your average students you see walking down the street," said Al 
Guenther, a physics teacher at Stephen White Junior High School in Carson. 
"Kids who choose to study physics are not your average students. These kids are 
smart." 
</P>
<P>
For Caltech, the idea was to treat high school students to a somewhat milder 
version of the school's infamous "Ditch Day" celebration, that annual day of 
fun in which seniors leave campus and booby trap their rooms with intricately 
laid puzzles, computer games and engineering challenges that require more than 
a passing knowledge of advanced physics and technical know-how to master. 
</P>
<P>
Ditch Day, which is held each spring for Caltech students, features antics like 
leaving a completely disassembled motor of a 1963 Chevrolet outside a dorm 
room, which underclassmen are then challenged to put back together. When the 
motor is started, its exhaust triggers a mechanism that opens the dorm door. 
</P>
<P>
But Saturday was for high school students -- some of them ninth-graders -- so 
these games had to be less challenging. Or so it would seem. 
</P>
<P>
That's why Mike Chou, a 20-year-old Caltech physics major from Torrance, 
designed his little glass jar puzzle so any high school honors student with a 
penchant for physics could figure it out. 
</P>
<P>
"I assume they had a year of high school physics," said Chou, watching a group 
from Blair High School in Pasadena puzzling over his game, appropriately named 
Archimedes Principle. "It's really not that difficult. All you need is basic 
intuition and creativity." 
</P>
<P>
Easy for Chou to say. When he leaves Caltech, there's a bright future waiting 
for him in "opto-electronics." 
</P>
<P>
"You know, fiber optics, that kind of thing," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
And then there was Matt Kidd, who asks to be called "Medeco" in honor of a lock 
and key manufacturer of the same name. 
</P>
<P>
"I have vast knowledge of keys," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A 20-year-old senior physics major from Bethesda, Md., Kidd dreamed up a puzzle 
called the Magnetic Lock in which students had to arrange rows of magnets in 
exactly the right pattern to open it. 
</P>
<P>
Kidd didn't seem to think Magnetic Lock was particularly daunting. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to make it challenging but doable," he said. "Any fool can put up a 
math problem on the door that no one can solve. I can do that for you right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Kidd said his infatuation with locks and keys will serve him well when he 
enters his chosen field of "high temperature superconductivity. Not guaranteed, 
but that's what it will be." 
</P>
<P>
For the students, it was better than a day at the beach -- rubbing elbows with 
the likes of "Medeco," calculating the height of Caltech's Milliken Library 
with nothing more than a string, a water balloon and some handy physics 
equations, and matching wits with a "simulated artificial intelligence" 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
The students spent the morning working in teams representing their schools and 
fanned out in the afternoon for individual competition, busying themselves by 
fashioning a contraption that cushions the fall of an egg from a three-story 
building without cracking the shell. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Blair and Stephen White, schools that sent teams included 
Lincoln High in Los Angeles, Walter Reed Junior High in North Hollywood, Canoga 
Park High, Artesia High and Marshall Fundamental Junior-Senior High School in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Blair High School won the team competition. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Louie, a math and physics teacher at Lincoln High, said the day gave his 
students a chance to creatively use what they learned in a classroom setting. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted them to see Caltech," he said. "Everyone knows that Caltech is just 
awesome. If they're ingenious they can do it. . . . It's a creative challenge."

CLIPPERS' EDWARDS IS SUSPENDED AFTER TESTING POSITIVE FOR DRUGS

Clipper rookie Jay Edwards, the 1989 Big Ten player of the year, was suspended 
Saturday by the NBA for the rest of the season after testing positive in a 
recent drug test. 
</P>
<P>
According to Clipper General Manager Elgin Baylor, Edwards checked into a 
substance-abuse center in Van Nuys Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Is is not known what drug was revealed by the league-administered test, one of 
three every rookie must take. 
</P>
<P>
"He's down and he's disappointed," Baylor said. "He feels badly. At this time 
now, the organization is just trying to encourage him and be supportive." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, at 21 the league's second-youngest player, has had previous drug 
problems. In September of 1988, he withdrew from Indiana University after 
flunking a school drug testing program, returning in time to be named Big Ten 
player of the year as a sophomore. He turned pro after the season. 
</P>
<P>
A second-round pick, he has spent nearly all of the season on the injured list 
because of tendinitis in his left knee. He appeared in four games, playing a 
total of 26 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards is from Marion, Ind., but remained in Los Angeles for rehabilitation on 
the knee during the Clippers' current five-game trip. He could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards is the third player to be suspended under the first year of the 
season-long rookie testing program. Stanley Brundy of the New Jersey Nets and 
Roy Marble of the Atlanta Hawks also are suspended without pay. SCOTT

BELCHER: OPENING DAY WON'T BE THE SAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although negotiators are guessing that baseball's lockout must end early this 
week to ensure a normal opening day, the Dodgers' 1989 opening-day pitcher said 
that in some ways, it is already too late. 
</P>
<P>
"They could end the lockout immediately, and the regularly scheduled first two 
weeks of the season are already changed," said Tim Belcher, Dodger player 
representative. "If we start on April 2, our opening-day pitcher is going to be 
able to go five innings. At the most. This is just not enough time for a 
starting pitcher to get ready. And it's going to be that way for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Belcher said from his Ohio home that there were other things early-game 
ticket-holders will notice. He said they will essentially be watching expensive 
spring training games. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first couple of weeks, everything will be much less than 100%," 
Belcher said. "The risk of injury is going to be very high, and that will 
affect the way everyone plays. Because no pitcher is going to be ready, you 
will see a lot of pitchers. Heck, if this lockout goes on much longer, you 
would see an opening day with everybody thrown out there. Just like spring 
training." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger fans would be particularly affected, since there are games scheduled at 
Dodger Stadium for the first seven days of the season. Those who bought 
opening-day tickets for the April 2 game against the San Diego Padres, hoping 
to see Orel Hershiser and Bruce Hurst, may well have to settle for John 
Wetteland against Greg Harris. 
</P>
<P>
Wetteland and Harris led their respective staffs in winter baseball innings and 
that kind of work could be the deciding factor. 
</P>
<P>
"You can figure that guys like John Wetteland figure to be further along 
because of winter ball," said Fred Claire, Dodger vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Belcher said that these opening-day scenarios are assuming that the lockout 
even ends in time for opening day. Using a formula based on other spring work 
stoppages, he has calculated March 11 as the last possible day for players to 
begin spring training for an April 2 opener to be possible. 
</P>
<P>
Because the players would likely ask for three to five days after the end of 
the lockout to transport themselves and equipment to camp, Belcher said an 
agreement must be in place by Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"The opening of the regular season already is not going to be what it usually 
is, the effects of the lockout are already going to show," Belcher said. "But 
at least right now, we still have an opening day. We get locked out past next 
week, and that's gone."

VERO BEACH HOPES ITS DODGER 'FAMILY' WILL HURRY HOME;

VERO BEACH, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The priest looked out over the congregation at St. Helen's church, spreading 
his arms and smiling. 
</P>
<P>
"My friends, there is more to life than spring training," Monsignor Irvine 
Nugent declared. 
</P>
<P>
He was answered by one nervous chuckle. Then another. Then silence. 
</P>
<P>
A major league baseball team isn't the only thing absent from Vero Beach these 
days. Life is slower, quieter and seems to have misplaced its sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the big league Dodgers canceled their charter flight into the 
tiny airport here. Two weeks ago, lines at restaurants dwindled, hotels began 
receiving cancellations and guys behind the bar began carrying their tips home 
in paper cups. 
</P>
<P>
As the merchants in this town of 18,000 say, it has been two weeks since 
somebody stole Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what having the Dodgers has been like for us, Christmas in the spring," 
said Roger Neach, owner of Dobber's men's shop on the trendy strip that borders 
the Atlantic Ocean. "Now, we don't know what is happening." 
</P>
<P>
Don Drysdale and Sandy Koufax used to come into his store to browse. Fans with 
credit cards followed them. 
</P>
<P>
But since the baseball owners locked the players out of camp, Neach has seen 
mostly disappointed faces. He tries to cheer the tourists, then turns his back 
and worries about reducing his inventory and cutting back hours usually given 
to extra spring employees. 
</P>
<P>
"All anybody wants to know now is when the lockout is going to end," Neach 
said. "I spend a lot of time telling them I don't know any more than anybody 
else. All any of us can do is hope." 
</P>
<P>
Vero Beach embraced the Dodgers when they moved their spring headquarters here 
in 1948 and has never quite released them. 
</P>
<P>
The wooden street signs proclaiming this as spring home of the Dodgers are 
never moved. The Dodger photos and memorabilia that line the walls of many 
businesses never come down. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like we have always been led to believe that they are our Dodgers, too," 
said Dennis Widenhofer, assistant store manager of a tire franchise. "It's 
always been like, they don't just belong to Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Every spring, this trust has been rewarded with the appearance of that 
chartered jet and with six weeks of spring training baseball that made the town 
bulge with fresh money and excitement. 
</P>
<P>
Until now. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like when you're waiting for your family to come over to your house for 
dinner and they don't show up," said J. B. Norton Jr., the executive vice 
president of the Vero Beach-Indian River County Chamber of Commerce. "At first, 
you are irritated. And then you are worried. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what we are doing now, sitting around, waiting and worrying about when 
our family is coming home." 
</P>
<P>
More than just their hearts are breaking. Norton says a study has shown that 
the Dodgers pump $4.5 million into the local economy. In total tourist income, 
the city figures the Dodgers are worth $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Not that we are losing all that," said Norton, who has a Dodger bat leaning 
against a corner of his office. "People come for other things, and a lot of 
people have to come no matter what happens because their (rooms) have already 
been paid for. But there will still be a significant impact." 
</P>
<P>
One businessman offered a different interpretation of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"You say the players are being locked out? It's Vero Beach that's being locked 
out," said Joe Brennan, local manager of a rental car agency. "This town is the 
one that's not getting paid this spring." 
</P>
<P>
Brennan normally does as much as $40,000 worth of business through the Dodgers, 
who rent 90% of their cars through him. Although he says it's not "life or 
death money," it is money directly tied to his standard of living. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of us do good business down here during the winter season, regardless," 
Brennan said. "But at least for me, what the Dodgers bring is gravy money. This 
is money that goes right to my pocket, the only time of the year that ever 
happens. It is something you try not to count on, but . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in his tiny office adjoining a gas station, with a weathered wall air 
conditioner running even though the door was open, Brennan put down his 
cigarette and sighed. 
</P>
<P>
"Already, you can take the goals I set for myself this year and crumple them up 
and throw them away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Widenhofer, sitting in Brennan's office exchanging laments, put the losses in 
even more personal terms. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest thing this town is missing is the 80-year-old guy driving down 
from New York (who has) been following the Dodgers since they were in 
Brooklyn," he said. "That guy ain't coming this year. And so I can't fix his 
tires or change his oil -- and I know I'd be changing his oil once. And so I 
lose." 
</P>
<P>
Some of those tourists are still coming. They can be found every day at 
Dodgertown's Holman Stadium. They pull up in their dusty cars with out-of-state 
license plates, walk through the one open gate and climb to the top of the 
stands. 
</P>
<P>
And there they sit. Even if the field is empty, they sit, as if any minute now 
Kirk Gibson will run across that dark green diamond. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Dodger minor leaguers show up, wearing funny blue jerseys with no 
names on the back. The tourists pull out their cameras, snap a few pictures of 
people whose names they may never know and wander back to their cars. 
</P>
<P>
Before leaving, they might stop and see Giggs Groul. Offering a big smile and 
no waiting, Groul has been running a full concession stand at Holman Stadium 
despite the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
She sells soft drinks, candy, the works. Want a nice cup of hot chocolate on an 
80-degree day? She'll pour it for you. The nacho and popcorn machines have been 
turned off, but she can still make both items in the microwave. 
</P>
<P>
And for what? After four hours one day, she had sold 15 hot dogs. The next day, 
she stood in front of the electric fan and yawned. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like the Maytag man -- nobody needs me," she said. "During the regular 
spring, we will have eight people working this stand, and folks will be lined 
up deep, deep, for the whole afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"Now? Nothing. And the people who do come here are so disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
Sean Cusson, 5, accompanied his father, Joe, and brother, Ned, from Boston on a 
spring trip that was supposed to include live baseball players. Cusson even 
bought some baseball cards for the trip, new and sturdy and perfect for 
autographing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking for Orel Hershiser," a sunburned Sean Cusson said while sitting 
with his dad along with a dozen other fans in the bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
His father looked down at the minor leaguers and shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
"Who are those guys?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Then Joe looked around for Ned, 16. The boy had hoped to pick up a few tips 
from major leaguers but had grown bored and walked off. 
</P>
<P>
Several miles away, in a bar-restaurant on the beach, another more expensive 
sort of boredom was taking place. 
</P>
<P>
"Spring training is all a matter of stools," said Paul Millen, part-time 
bartender at the popular Bobby's. "You got four stools with coaches on them, 
four stools with writers on them, Maybe a couple of stools with players. And 
then all kinds of women and other people who want to be around those stools." 
</P>
<P>
And with no spring training, said Millen, you can go broke. During the rest of 
the year, he works three hours a night. While the Dodgers are here, he works 
six hours a night. Guess how much he is working these days? 
</P>
<P>
"Just don't try to even guess how much money I'm losing," said Millen, 40, who 
is also a part-time flight instructor. "Just say my income has been cut in 
half. All of a sudden, during what is supposed to be my best time of the year, 
I'm barely getting by. Spring training is like what I live on." 
</P>
<P>
On the walls of his bar hang photos of mugging, smiling, posing Dodgers. Of 
Dodgers in the World Series. Of Dodgers in happier times. 
</P>
<P>
Millen excused himself, walked past the dozen people who quietly gathered 
around the bar and switched the channel on one of the wall television sets to a 
Laker game.

MONTOYA DEAL WORTH $1.45 MILLION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Did someone say Max Montoya's reported $650,000-a-year contract makes him the 
highest-paid Raider offensive lineman ever? 
</P>
<P>
Actually, he'll make more than that. 
</P>
<P>
A source familiar with the details of the contract said it's a two-year, 
$1.45-million deal, composed of: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A $50,000 "relocation" bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A $550,000 salary plus a $100,000 reporting bonus this season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A $650,000 salary plus a $100,000 reporting bonus in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
On an annual basis, Montoya's contract beats the three-year, $1.8-million 
package the 49ers gave Dave Waymer, the biggest Plan B total contract of this 
off-season. MARK HEISLER

SAVING FACE AN ISSUE IN BASEBALL TALKS, SOME EXPERTS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When baseball's collective bargaining talks resume Monday, some mediation and 
psychology experts say the owners and players will begin negotiating an issue 
of a different sort. 
</P>
<P>
"They are going to have to come to an agreement on the sub-issue -- that of 
saving face," said Dr. Thomas Tutko, professor of psychology at San Jose State. 
"Both sides have backed themselves into a corner and they have to find some way 
to save face, and I don't think it is possible. 
</P>
<P>
"Both the owners and the players have lost. They are still playing one up, and 
their object is to try to get across to the American public who is in charge, 
who has the power. I think they have both lost sight of the meaning of 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
As the lockout enters its 18th day, some experts recently polled believe the 
negotiations have evolved into a battle of egos. 
</P>
<P>
Others, such as Kenneth Kowalski, a federal mediator in New York, disagree. He 
says "responsible parties put their egos aside" in negotiations. He believes 
both sides are doing that. 
</P>
<P>
The experts seem to agree on one aspect of the baseball talks. The main tactic 
used by the owners in these negotiations -- the spring training lockout -- has 
served no purpose. 
</P>
<P>
"The lockout was a symbolic weapon of the seriousness of the owners," said 
Brian Flores, district director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation 
Service in New York. "But I think you have to balance that against their (the 
owners') conduct in negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
"Have they stayed steadfast with revenue sharing or with their arbitration 
proposal? No. It would seem to me that there are a few cracks in the facade 
here and there." 
</P>
<P>
Since the players haven't missed a paycheck, Flores says the lockout cannot be 
an effective tool. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not much of a weapon if I told you as a player you're not losing any 
money because I'm not going to pay you anyway. That you don't have to go out 
and sweat twice a day and sign autographs for the tourists, but instead can go 
to the dog track everyday," Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
Kowalski says that although the lockout hasn't been effective, it will become a 
factor in future negotiations as the regular season approaches. Then, he says, 
the pressure will be on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
But if the lockout was a ploy to give the owners the edge in the current 
negotiations, it hasn't worked, according to Dr. Richard Lister, a clinical 
psychologist from Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"The players have a terrific edge now, because they aren't getting paid 
anyway," Lister said. "Once the season starts, the edge will change because the 
players will hurt in their pocketbook. And, obviously, when you hurt in the 
pocketbook it becomes a mental situation. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone has bills to pay, these guys just have bigger toys." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jonathon Brower, also a clinical psychologist, says the lockout also 
affects the players psychologically. 
</P>
<P>
"For athletes, when the time of year comes around that they are supposed to be 
getting ready for the season, it creates anxiety for them not to be getting 
ready to play. Because it is a big change, on an emotional level, it's scary. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of them are getting ready on their own. But it is a big difference 
emotionally being at a high school baseball field as opposed to being treated 
like royalty at spring training." 
</P>
<P>
Any fears of the players were seemingly put to rest in the recent meetings held 
by Don Fehr, executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Assn. In 
each of the three meetings, the players have left the meeting in staunch 
support of the union. 
</P>
<P>
That support, however, comes easy for a player, who views the economics of the 
sport as a basis for his self worth, according to Dr. Bruce Ogilivie, a 
clinical psychologist who has been a sports consultant for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
"The ego of a player gets tied up with his worth as a human being," Ogilivie 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"A player reads where another player makes a certain amount of money, and then 
measures his own contribution in terms of salary against that player. It's an 
unreality against which they are measuring themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Flores says that the owners have used the negotiations to test the resolve of 
the players. Still, he doesn't believe the players' solidarity will give them 
the edge when negotiations resume. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think either one of them has the edge," Flores said. "Neither one of 
them is winning until they sit down and face the problem ahead of them. In 
fact, I think they are both losing because they are in the scrutiny of the 
public eye and people tend to get turned off." 
</P>
<P>
Lister agrees there is no winner, but says it is because the procedures being 
used in the talks are wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"The owners and players have put themselves in a lose-lose position because of 
the adversarial method they use to negotiate," Lister said. 
</P>
<P>
"One group has their representative, the other has theirs, and they go at it 
like a court of law. The way they have been posturing themselves, they have 
come on so macho, that neither side is going to back down. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same method they've used in the past and it hasn't worked. They need 
an outside mediator to preside and get this thing settled." 
</P>
<P>
That outside mediator shouldn't be Commissioner Fay Vincent, according to both 
Lister and Paul Staudohar, professor of business administration at Cal State 
Hayward and a labor arbitrator. 
</P>
<P>
Staudohar thinks that the result of Vincent's involvement in the negotiations 
usurped the authority of the owner's chief negotiator, Chuck O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
"The general wisdom of negotiations is that the chief executive stays out of 
the negotiations," Staudohar said. "In this case, the commissioner is enough of 
a chief executive not to get involved. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of the dynamics of negotiations, you want the negotiator to consult 
with the chief executive as a buffer. The commissioner was trying to mediate 
the dispute, and though I think initially he was trying to bring it to a quick 
resolve, now he seems to have gone beyond that." 
</P>
<P>
One area of agreement by all is that there will eventually be an agreement, 
although no one would predict when. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody on the outside really knows what the real agenda is, but there is an 
agenda somewhere," Kowalski said. He believes that pressure from outside forces 
will increase as the season nears. "Everything seems to revolve around the 
arbitration issue, but there are four or five other issues. The parties have a 
good idea just where everything fits, and once it starts to move, it all falls 
in place."

TWIN JORDANS BETTER THAN ONE FOR UNLV; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: REBELS GET PASADENA PACKAGE DEAL, WHICH HAS THEM AMONG THE 
NATION'S ELITE WOMEN'S TEAMS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For many, recruiting Pauline Jordan was simply too much trouble. Geannine, her 
identical twin sister, was always in the way. The two were inseparable, and to 
get one you had to take the other. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to experience playing against Geannine," Pauline says. 
</P>
<P>
Still, interest in Pauline Jordan, a star at Pasadena Muir High, was intense 
enough in 1987 that many of the nation's top women's basketball programs, 
according to the twins, were willing to take a package deal. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, that angered Pauline, a 6-foot-3 center. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the schools cut (Geannine) out without really giving her a chance," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
Geannine adds: "We were just looking for the truth -- how we would fit in with 
the school and if we would graduate." 
</P>
<P>
So when it came down to choosing between Cal State Long Beach, the power of the 
Big West Conference, and its toughest rival, Nevada Las Vegas, the choice was 
relatively easy. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach was right in the twins' back yard. And both Pauline and Geannine 
were recruited by 49er Coach Joan Bonvicini. 
</P>
<P>
But talk spread that Geannine was being offered a scholarship just to assure 
that Pauline would accept one. 
</P>
<P>
Pauline: "Joan (Bonvicini) stressed her feelings that Geannine might not get 
much playing time." 
</P>
<P>
Bonvicini denies that she offered Geannine a scholarship just to get Pauline, 
but remembers Geannine as being just "pretty good" as a high school player. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Jim Bolla of Nevada Las Vegas saw things differently. 
</P>
<P>
"Some schools recruited Pauline more than Geannine," he says. "Some just wanted 
Pauline and not Geannine. We went after both of them equally. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knew about Pauline. She was a first-team All-American and very 
dominant player. Geannine, I think, got overlooked because Pauline was so good. 
She played in Pauline's shadow, but we thought Geannine was a good player, 
also." 
</P>
<P>
That, and the fact that only one of UNLV's women's basketball players in the 
last 10 years did not graduate, helped sway the twins. 
</P>
<P>
Both are on schedule to graduate in May with degrees in criminal justice. 
</P>
<P>
As for the women's basketball program . . . 
</P>
<P>
"What they have done is enable us to take that next step," Bolla says. "We were 
a top-20 program. They're one of the reasons why we're now a top-five program." 
</P>
<P>
The Jordans, along with such players as guards Vicki Lander and Linda Staley, 
have transformed the Nevada Las Vegas women's team into the new power in the 
Big West and the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels clinched their first conference championship in five years Feb. 22 
with a blowout victory over San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
Led by the Jordans, they romped over Long Beach twice, winning by 30 points in 
Las Vegas and by 12 at University Gym on the Long Beach campus, where the 49ers 
had never lost a conference game. 
</P>
<P>
Pauline Jordan averaged 28 points and 16 rebounds in the two games. Geannine 
averaged 13 points and nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels, ranked 10th before the start of the season, climbed to No. 2 before 
losing their last regular-season game before a full house at Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
The loss broke a 23-game winning streak and was the first since the Rebels lost 
by one point to Virginia in the second game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Bolla takes most of the blame, saying, "I didn't do a good job of getting the 
kids ready." 
</P>
<P>
But he added that the defeat merely serves to relieve pressure the players 
might have felt with such a streak going as they prepare for this week's Big 
West tournament at Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
It also dropped UNLV back to No. 5, but the Rebels still figure to be the No. 2 
seeded team behind Stanford in the NCAA West Regional when the pairings are 
announced next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Pauline has led the Rebels in almost every statistical category two consecutive 
years. Her 16.6 points, 12.3 rebounds, 99 blocked shots and 61 steals are tops 
on the squad. 
</P>
<P>
"Now all of the sudden we're starting to get national recognition," Bolla says, 
again attributing that to Pauline Jordan's play. Aggressive, emotional and 
demonstrative, she can shoot well in traffic and is considered an excellent 
passer. 
</P>
<P>
C. Vivian Stringer, coach of the University of Iowa and the women's national 
team, of which Pauline is a member, calls her "an excellent rebounder and one 
of the premier centers in America." 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Coach Debbie Ryan calls Pauline "a critical person for UNLV in its 
rise to national prominence. . . . She dominates the boards, and if you 
dominate the boards you dominate the game." 
</P>
<P>
Geannine -- despite averaging 12.1 points and 7.2 rebounds and making 77.4% of 
her free throws -- and the rest of the squad remain in Pauline's shadow. 
</P>
<P>
"She is better," Geannine admits. "But then it's more her style that gets her 
all that recognition. She does all the spins and I don't. I just put the ball 
in. I take the easier route. Pauline takes the more noticeable route." 
</P>
<P>
Bolla agrees, calling the 6-foot-2 Geannine a quiet, but very effective 
forward-center. "At the end of the game you'll look at the box score and 
Geannine will have 18 points, nine boards, two blocks and three steals -- and 
you won't even know it." 
</P>
<P>
What Bolla is well aware of, however, is that both the Jordans and Staley, who 
leads the team in assists with 4.3 a game, will graduate this spring. 
</P>
<P>
He says he will rely on depth that helped the Rebels through this season -- 
both Jordans averaged slightly more than 27 minutes a game, and many of the 
games were blowouts; on Lander, who was second to Pauline in scoring with a 
12.2 point average, and on 6-6 Merlelynn Lange and Janice Holliday. 
</P>
<P>
Bolla, however, acknowledges that things won't be the same next season. "We 
have to understand we're not going to replace Pauline and Geannine," he says of 
the Jordans, who intend to play professionally in Europe. "We need to get 
someone to come in and need to get the returning kids to come in and pick up 
some of the slack. And then we'll be OK."

HIS GOAL IS TO SCORE THEM IN WORLD CUP; 
</P>
<P>
SOCCER: WYNALDA MOVES UP FROM DEVELOPMENTAL SQUAD TO STRIKE A BLOW FOR U.S. 
NATIONAL TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His first appearance in a screaming headline occurred 12 years ago when a 
Thousand Oaks newspaper stretched this banner across the top of the sports 
page: "Eric Wynalda -- Soccer Figure at 8." 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Eric's father, David, was surprised by the headline and felt Eric 
really didn't deserve being singled out. Sure, Eric scored 56 goals in leading 
his youth soccer team to a state championship season, "but we thought he was 
just having fun out there. We didn't see him as special," David says. 
</P>
<P>
However, the reporter who wrote the story accompanying the headline was an 
Irish-born soccer expert, David says, "who recognized the things in Eric that 
we couldn't see." 
</P>
<P>
Today, it no longer takes a trained eye to determine that Eric is special. 
Always a prodigious scorer -- 88 goals in three varsity seasons at Westlake 
High and Southern Section 4-A Division offensive player of the year -- Wynalda 
is a strong candidate for the U.S. national team that will compete in the World 
Cup starting June 10 in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
"Eric is a gifted athlete," U.S. Coach Bob Gansler says. 
</P>
<P>
Currently considered the team's No. 1 striker, Wynalda started at forward in 
the last four exhibitions, including a 3-1 loss to the Soviet Union before an 
estimated crowd of 61,000 in Palo Alto last week, and just signed a contract 
with the U.S. Soccer Federation. His presence in the lineup, Gansler says, 
"adds some attacking flair to our team." 
</P>
<P>
But despite Wynalda's scoring skills, his status is surprising -- he wasn't on 
the national team until January. While strikers such as Peter Vermes and Brent 
Goulet were helping the United States to its stunning performance in World Cup 
qualifying last year, Wynalda was playing for the national developmental 
B-team. It took six months before Wynalda was able to move up to the big team. 
</P>
<P>
"Eric caught our attention when he was working with the B-team," Gansler says. 
"We knew he was a talent." 
</P>
<P>
Gansler wanted Wynalda to join the national team for a game against the Soviets 
in Philadelphia last August, but he came down with mononucleosis. The disease 
laid him up for two months and prevented his starting the collegiate season on 
time at San Diego State. In late December, Gansler called Eric at his parents' 
Westlake Village home and asked him to attend a two-week training camp in La 
Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
Wynalda, 6-1, 170, with long sandy-colored hair, was one of 28 players Gansler 
brought to camp. Most of the country's top strikers -- including some who play 
professionally abroad -- were there, but Wynalda stood out "and started to 
shine," Gansler says. By the end of camp, Gansler said Wynalda was his top 
striker but needed international experience. 
</P>
<P>
Wynalda went to Miami with the national team for the Marlboro Cup matches in 
January. But Gansler started a midfielder, Hugo Perez, ahead of Wynalda in the 
opening game against Costa Rica, and Perez played the first 45 minutes in a 2-0 
loss. Wynalda played the last 15 minutes, "made an impact," he says, and 
Gansler told him he had earned a chance to start against Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
Four minutes into the Colombia game, Wynalda, at 20 the youngest starter in the 
lineup, took a pass and went in alone on the Colombian goalkeeper, beating him 
with a quick shot for the only U.S. goal in a 1-1 tie. 
</P>
<P>
But Wynalda doesn't have a lock on a starting job or even a guaranteed backup 
role on the World Cup team. Gansler isn't going to name the final 22-man roster 
until May, after several more international exhibitions. And, according to 
Gansler, Wynalda still needs to improve. 
</P>
<P>
"At times he looks very, very good, and at times he gets caught with his 
concentration waning," Gansler says. "Technically he's fine, but he has to get 
better on the tactical end of things." Then Gansler adds, "I'm betting that 
he's going to get it done." 
</P>
<P>
Wynalda's next test will be March 10 against Finland in Tampa, Fla. "Coach 
Gansler always tells us, 'You're only as good as your last performance,' " 
Wynalda says. "That saying always goes off in my mind. I know if I have a bad 
game he'll give someone else a look." 
</P>
<P>
Most experts say that the problem with American soccer is the lack of skillful 
finishers, players who can score goals. Wynalda is a rare exception, says Chuck 
Clegg, soccer coach at San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
"Eric's ability to take on a player one-on-one is the best I've ever seen in an 
American," Clegg says. "And to have developed this skill with a purely American 
experience is very unusual." 
</P>
<P>
Wynalda learned to play in the American Youth Soccer Organization. When he was 
5 and his brother Brandt was 7, they joined an AYSO team coached by their 
father. The team's assistant coach was Italian-born Tino Forino, who spoke 
little English but knew how to play the European way. 
</P>
<P>
"Eric was inspired by Tino," says David, who owns a soccer specialty shop in 
Westlake Village. "The kids didn't understand much of what he was saying, but 
he still taught them the basics." 
</P>
<P>
In his junior year at Westlake High, Wynalda was coached by another European, a 
former player from Austria named Rudi Fedimeyer, who was studying American 
soccer for his doctorate degree. Fedimeyer helped refine Wynalda's techniques, 
and by the time Eric enrolled at San Diego State, he was "one of the most 
skillful players we've ever had," Clegg says. 
</P>
<P>
Wynalda stayed at San Diego only three seasons. In his freshman year, he scored 
the winning goal against UCLA in the NCAA Division I tournament quarterfinal 
and led the Aztecs into the final, where they lost to Clemson, 1-0. But last 
December, after the season, Wynalda decided to drop out of school and forgo his 
senior year of soccer. 
</P>
<P>
Only a handful of Americans currently play first division soccer elsewhere in 
the world, but Wynalda made strong connections when he and Aztec teammate 
Marcello Balboa played in a farewell game for Brazilian soccer star Zico last 
December in Brazil. Wynalda says he has offers to play first-division soccer in 
Spain and Holland. 
</P>
<P>
His priority, however, is making the U.S. World Cup team. "I'm very confident 
that I can do some very good things for the team," he says. "I think I bring an 
element of unpredictability to the attack." 
</P>
<P>
A major underdog in the 24-nation tournament, the United States is grouped with 
Czechoslovakia, Austria and host Italy in the opening round. But Wynalda says 
the United States is no longer a pushover. He points out that the national team 
was 8-18-9 in international games in 1988 and 18-6-3 last year. 
</P>
<P>
"That has a lot to do with the confidence we have in ourselves as a soccer 
nation," he says. "We don't go on the field any more trying just to hold our 
own. We expect to win and we don't feel overwhelmed. We don't say, 'Oh, we're 
playing Brazil,' and panic. 
</P>
<P>
"In the qualifying rounds we proved we could play defense. Now we have to 
generate a consistent attack."

GERONTOLOGY: FOUR USC GRADUATE STUDENTS LIVING IN A CONVALESCENT CENTER GET A 
PERSONAL VIEW OF AGING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LARSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forget the tacky posters, the raucous rock 'n' roll and the hustle and bustle 
of dorm life. For graduate student Irian Diaz, they're not part of the living 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Her 250 neighbors would never tolerate such tumult, but not because they're 
docile apartment dwellers. 
</P>
<P>
It's because Diaz, 24, and three other grad students from USC's Andrus 
Gerontology Center live, full time, at the Kingsley Manor 
retirement-convalescent facility in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for room and board, each of the four students works 16 hours a week 
at the manor, where the average age of the residents is 82. 
</P>
<P>
For those on the verge of a career in gerontology, the novel living situation 
offers a first-hand view of the satisfactions and sorrows of growing older. 
</P>
<P>
Diaz, to accommodate her class schedule, spreads her manor duties over four 
days. She devotes the most time -- 7 1/2 hours -- on Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
To spend a typical day with her is to encounter a smorgasbord of experiences 
and emotions. 
</P>
<P>
At 8:30 one recent morning, Diaz's first order was to prepare for a visit by 28 
third- and fourth-graders from nearby Ramona Elementary School. She and Susie 
Lukasek, program director, puttered around in the manor's sixth-floor Skyroom, 
which this day would serve as a kitchen where the youngsters would learn how to 
make Valentine cookies. 
</P>
<P>
Lukasek recalled a time when the manor's resident centenarian had talked to 
some other youngsters, who were flabbergasted that a person could be so old; 
some wanted to touch him, as they might a redwood tree. 
</P>
<P>
As Diaz gathered up flour, baking powder and honey, she related her own amusing 
tale about another recent Skyroom event: "I was the instructor for a cane drill 
team. It was called the Ben-Gay Brigade." 
</P>
<P>
But not all her moments have been as light. 
</P>
<P>
She reflected on the first time, as a gerontology undergraduate, that she had 
seen, first-hand, life's inevitable conclusion: "I was working at a 
convalescent hospital, and I got to know one woman. . . . When I arrived one 
day at 3 p.m. to begin my shift, she had just died. She was still lying in her 
bed. Until then, I had never known anyone who had died. That night, I couldn't 
enter her room. I couldn't even bring myself to go by her room in the hallway." 
</P>
<P>
In gerontology, explained Diaz -- who hopes to find work in program development 
for the elderly when she graduates in May -- "they get us to realize that death 
is a part of life." 
</P>
<P>
It was, however, a remote concern for the next hour as the children visited and 
the resident retirees began to arrive for the event. 
</P>
<P>
Alice Andre, 85, was the first there and had time to tell a little about 
herself: "I was head counselor at Hamilton High School during the '50s and 
'60s. That was Sputnik time. We were encouraging everyone to go into physics 
and engineering." 
</P>
<P>
Lorena Havlik, who only allowed that she is in her 80s, arrived and observed of 
the schoolchildren's visit, "It will be good for a change to hear young ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Karoline Straky, 82, agreed, saying: "It is good when the young and the old get 
together." 
</P>
<P>
In trooped the pupils, taking seats at long wooden tables. Andre and Havlik 
engaged them in small talk. 
</P>
<P>
Diaz, meantime, bustled about, putting lumps of butter into bowls, handing out 
cups of honey, pleading: "Make sure everybody gets a chance to stir the bowl!" 
</P>
<P>
Miriam Melhorn, 85, cautioned some youngsters near her: "Don't use too much 
flour!" 
</P>
<P>
Soon the aroma of baking dough filled the air. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, each pupil proudly carried off a heart-shaped cookie. 
</P>
<P>
But Diaz had little time to savor the moment. A hectic day loomed at the 
institution -- a cluster of ivy-covered, red brick buildings surrounded by 
manicured gardens. It has been on the scene since 1912. 
</P>
<P>
Administrator Bruce Udelfsaid Kingsley Manor offers three levels of services to 
the aged. Some of the residents, still largely independent, get meals, maid 
service, linens and other services for $855 to $965 a month. Some need more 
assistance -- help with bathing or dressing -- for which they are charged 
$1,390 to $1,515 monthly. And some residents require convalescent care, which 
runs $102 to $105 daily for a private room. 
</P>
<P>
At 11 a.m., while en route to the manor's convalescent area, Diaz stopped at 
Cal's Popcorn, a stand run for two hours daily for the past seven years by Cal 
Tedford, 66, who turns over the proceeds to the resident-run gift shop. 
</P>
<P>
Diaz and Straky shared a 25-cent bag of popcorn before Diaz headed to the grim 
confines of the convalescent area, where many patients are hooked to oxygen 
tubes and some are at the last stop on the journey of life. 
</P>
<P>
But no matter their physical condition, most residents in the convalescent 
section still cherish attention. Providing it is one of Diaz's duties. 
</P>
<P>
She poked her head into some rooms where patients slept. She kept moving along 
until she reached the room of Zuma Palmer, 93, who was thumbing through a 
newspaper television section, checking for sports events involving USC, her 
alma mater. "I like to keep up with whatever they are doing," she said. "I also 
watch baseball, golf, any sport." 
</P>
<P>
In response to Diaz's inquiry about how she was feeling, Palmer had her usual 
answer ready: "Oh, fat and sassy." 
</P>
<P>
For 32 years, Palmer wrote about radio and TV for the Hollywood Citizen-News, 
which was owned by her brother. She still keeps up with the news, watching the 
MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour as often as possible. 
</P>
<P>
The nonagenarian gestured toward an afghan on her bed, near where her 
student-friend was seated. "When my mother got out of the hospital, we both 
crocheted it," she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
On Sundays, when Diaz works four hours exclusively on this floor, she always 
allows time to give Palmer a wheelchair ride. "I fell, and now I have to be in 
convalescent," Palmer explained. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on her age, she observed: "I just take it a day at a time. I'm not 
out to set any records." 
</P>
<P>
About noon in the main lobby, Diaz saw Howard Herty grabbing his mail. Herty, 
who declined to give his age, is a celebrity of sorts among residents because 
not only does he still drive, he drives a classic. 
</P>
<P>
In the parking lot, he showed Diaz his baby blue, 1957 T-Bird, complete with 
the two porthole windows. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to work in publicity at MGM," he said, leaning on his cane. "In 1958, a 
secretary there sold me the car for $2,500. Every time she sees me now, she 
wants to buy it back." 
</P>
<P>
Herty drives it twice a week. Saturday mornings, he has it washed. Saturday 
nights, he tools over to Lawry's Restaurant for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
"See, I have 177,600 miles on it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Diaz often has heard his recollections of traveling the world six times, 
visiting 57 nations. She also has heard him reminisce about movie stars he 
worked with and their quirks -- such as Spencer Tracy hating to fly. 
</P>
<P>
At lunch, Diaz joined three seniors in the dining room. As they ate, Helen May 
Smith, 68, manor president, told how her council has searched for a public 
library branch within three miles or so of the institution. "We found one, but 
it had steps, and that is difficult for our residents," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sonja Dremin, 75, the manor's sports and games chairwoman, described Monday 
night bingo: "Prizes are useful things, such as boxes of Kleenex and envelopes. 
Also, everybody puts in a quarter, for a jackpot." 
</P>
<P>
Margaretta Rabe, who declined to give her age, is manor chairwoman of house and 
grounds. She says she's proof that it's never too late for romance. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, she and her true love met over a pool table. "I never dreamed I 
would marry again," she said. "But he lived across the hall from me, we got 
married and nobody knew it for six months. He passed away in 1987. There are 
many more women than men here -- and he was a heartbreaker." 
</P>
<P>
Seated nearby was the manor's most senior resident, Peter W. Ross, 101, and his 
fourth wife, Esther, 84. Ross, a devout man, says: "I didn't divorce any (of my 
wives) . . . they are all in heaven." 
</P>
<P>
He added for emphasis: "I hope it'll never come to the point where I don't 
appreciate a good-looking lady!" 
</P>
<P>
Most days, Diaz and the other students join the residents at meals. But 
sometimes they must be in the office, typing, filing and answering phones. 
</P>
<P>
While Diaz took care of some chores shortly after lunch, two other USC students 
chatted about their manor work. 
</P>
<P>
Harriet Edwards, 30, said she sometimes takes residents in wheelchairs for 
outings. 
</P>
<P>
"My first one," she recalled, "was a woman who had suffered a stroke and had 
just recovered. Everybody was so glad to see her back, and she was ecstatic to 
be back. . . . She asked to stop and look at the flowers. When we were in the 
lobby, she played the piano for about five minutes. It was the first time she 
had touched the keys since her stroke. Everybody in the vicinity came over to 
listen." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards said she is studying gerontology "because I have always liked older 
people. A lot of significant people in my life were older." 
</P>
<P>
Emily Calvert, 22, praised the 7-year-old manor residence program, which is 
part of the two-year USC gerontology studies, saying: "At school, we focus on 
professional issues. Here I see application at a practical level. 
</P>
<P>
"And to the residents here, we are the outside world. We are the young coming 
to them." 
</P>
<P>
That afternoon, Diaz pitched in to help with a special bingo game for seven 
residents. They showed that no matter what their ages, they still enjoy the 
thrill of victory: Prizes such as liquid soap and tubes of toothpaste were 
happily accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Diaz and two workers took three residents in wheelchairs on a leisurely 
grounds tour. On the ride, Julia Long, 87, disclosed her simple secret to 
living a long life: "Be happy." 
</P>
<P>
By 4 p.m., Diaz's duties had ended, and she was back in her apartment. 
</P>
<P>
In a matter of hours, most of the manor's residents would be hitting their 
beds. 
</P>
<P>
But Diaz would just starting to hit her books.

PASS A LOUTRE, La. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Windham, wildlife biologist for the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and 
Fisheries, flew his Cessna 180 float plane over the Mississippi River where it 
spills into the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"See that big bay over there on the west side of the river?" Windham asked as 
he passed low over the Pass A Loutre Wildlife Management Area. "That bay was 
all marshland, 10,000 acres of prime wetlands 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It's part of the 100,000 acres or more of the Mississippi River Delta 
transformed from marsh to open water since 1956. We're losing up to 50 square 
miles a year of Louisiana to erosion. The whole bottom of the state is 
disappearing." 
</P>
<P>
For 15 years, Windham, 39, has worked to prevent the wetlands from vanishing. 
He is a technical adviser to the Louisiana Wetlands Conservation and 
Restoration Plan now being developed by the governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time a comprehensive plan for saving the state's wetlands is 
being put in place. The plan is under consideration by the Legislature with 
funding to come from oil and gas revenues," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Louisiana plan calls for $20 million to be spent on wetlands' conservation 
and restoration in fiscal 1990-91 and $15 to $25 million each succeeding year, 
contingent on oil and gas revenues. Much of the state's coastal marshland from 
Texas to Mississippi is leased to gas and oil development. 
</P>
<P>
Windham knows as much as anyone about the 4.5 million Louisiana wetland acres 
-- 4 million of them in private hands, 500,000 in the state's. 
</P>
<P>
He spends hours each week flying the bottom of Louisiana, visiting Wildlife and 
Fisheries field stations accessible only by float plane or boat. 
</P>
<P>
He flies to check oil and gas development sites to ensure the marshlands aren't 
harmed. He patrols the Mississippi Flyway to monitor waterfowl. He visits 
trappers and fishermen in swampland camps to get a feel for wildlife status. 
</P>
<P>
Windham flies congressmen, scientists and coastal erosion experts over the 
wetlands, pointing out problem areas. 
</P>
<P>
"In this job, a person has to wear many hats. The whole bottom of Louisiana is 
one gigantic marsh, a remote, roadless area comprising 40% of the nation's 
coastal wetlands," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On this outing, Windham flew over an incredible maze of waterways and thousands 
of marsh islands along the final miles of the Mississippi River, where it 
branches into four major channels that spill into the Gulf: Main Pass, Pass A 
Loutre (which means otter pass in French), South Pass and Southwest Pass. 
</P>
<P>
He passed over Pilot Town near the river's end; it's a collection of houses 
along a 3/4-mile boardwalk on a marsh island, which is 20 miles from the end of 
the nearest road and is accessible only by boat. Pilot boat crews live here in 
stilt houses. Each day, the crews take an average of 35 ocean-going vessels 100 
miles up and down the river to and from New Orleans. As the float plane flew 
over Pass A Loutre Wildlife Management Area, the sky was a maze of 
salt-and-pepper dots -- huge flocks of snow geese, cormorants, pintails, teal, 
white pelicans and scores of other birds hopscotched from one island to 
another, feeding on lush marsh grasses. 
</P>
<P>
Windham explained that many factors are involved in the loss of wetlands: 
"Hurricanes revert hundreds of acres of marsh to open water overnight. 
Population explosions of nutria and muskrats eat themselves out of house and 
home by gobbling up all the vegetation on marsh islands, reducing the wetlands 
to mud flats. 
</P>
<P>
"High tides rip out land. Salt water intrusion occurs." 
</P>
<P>
The biologist also cited the creation of levees for navigation along the 
Mississippi as a factor; the levees shunt sediment and fresh water off the 
Continental Shelf into the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"Sediments -- soil, debris, silt, clay and sands -- historically were deposited 
at places like Pass A Loutre, building up coastal wetlands. Now the sediments 
run out to sea," said Windham. "A lot of the sediments that came down the river 
in the past are getting trapped along the Mississippi's route from Minnesota to 
the Gulf." 
</P>
<P>
Part of Windham's job at Pass A Loutre has been to oversee sediment diversion 
projects and construction of fences to trap debris before it is lost at the 
river's mouth. 
</P>
<P>
While enormous tracts of marshland have been lost, Louisiana's Wildlife and 
Fisheries Department has been busy controlling coastal erosion and creating new 
marshland. 
</P>
<P>
Windham flew over water-control structures diverting fresh water and sediments 
from the Mississippi into fenced-off areas where sediments are being trapped, 
and new islands and marshland are being created. 
</P>
<P>
"Coastal erosion in the past few years has slowed. What we're working toward is 
to turn the process around with adequate funding under the new state plan. 
Eventually, we hope to have more land added each year to the state than land 
lost through erosion of the coastal wetlands," Windham said.

EAST GERMAN TOWN'S BITTER IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BITTERFELD, East Germany 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's a German saying that "if we don't see each other again in this world, 
we'll see each other in Bitterfeld." 
</P>
<P>
To suggest that Bitterfeld is a kind of nether world is not far from the truth. 
Bitterfeld is described as the most polluted city in East Germany, which is 
sometimes called the "cesspool of Europe," among the most polluted of all 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
"They should change the name of Bitterfeld to Agent Orange," a West German 
journalist who was born in nearby Leipzig and once reported from Vietnam 
remarked to a recent visitor. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the name of the grim, sullen city means bitter field, though it was 
christened long before the development of the coal mines and the chemical and 
power plants that have given the city its reputation as the dirtiest town in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Bitterfeld, population 20,000, is afflicted with a variety of forms of 
pollution. The skies are almost always hazy from dust and coal particles rising 
from enormous open-pit mines, and gases pouring out of the tall stacks that 
surround the town. The water is soured with nitrates from fertilizers. 
</P>
<P>
The fallout in Bitterfeld's streets runs to more than a pound of particles per 
square yard per month. 
</P>
<P>
"We have serious lung disease problems," said City Councilman Rainer Fromman, 
who is in charge of environmental matters. "We get the coal particles from the 
mines and now that the topsoil is gone, we get silicon dust as well. Sometimes 
the visibility is so bad it's hard to drive. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the life expectancy here is five years lower than in other parts of 
the country. But it's difficult to tell because all the figures on disease in 
this area were considered top secret until recently." 
</P>
<P>
Under the Communists, local officials were forbidden to take pollution samples 
or to make public any information on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
To give Bitterfeld schoolchildren a taste of fresh air, classes are moved to an 
island in the Baltic Sea for a month each year. 
</P>
<P>
Bitterfeld's neighbors fare little better. Just up the road is Wolfen, where 
the nation's largest photochemical plant is situated. Its dozen stacks produce 
stinging emissions. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the pollution problem is nationwide. In Leipzig, authorities report 
that a smog alarm should be sounded every day -- if there were such an alarm. 
</P>
<P>
A recent poll in the West German magazine Spiegel indicated that East Germans' 
desire for a better environment ranks second only to their desire for 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
During the 40 years of Communist rule, much of the country's industrial plant 
became outdated and inefficient, emitting pollutants of every kind. West German 
experts say that if their standards were applied to East Germany, half the 
industrial plant would have to be shut down. 
</P>
<P>
Kurt Lietzman, the Environment Ministry official from Bonn who liaisons with 
East Germany, put it this way: "The whole economy has to be reconstructed. East 
Germany is decades behind Western standards." 
</P>
<P>
In part, East Germany's pollution woes can be traced to the main source of 
energy: brown coal, which when burned produces noxious sulfur dioxide. East 
Germany has Europe's highest level of sulfur dioxide emissions, which are 
widely blamed for acid rain, which in turn is killing forests. 
</P>
<P>
Chemical plants discharge untreated effluents directly into rivers. One plant, 
near Halle, pumps 50 pounds of mercury into the Saale River every day, 10 times 
as much as the West German chemical giant BASF in Ludwigshaven puts into the 
Rhine in a year. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 20% of the country's water is so polluted that it cannot be used, 
according to Peter Diederich, minister of the environment. The Elbe has 
acquired the dubious distinction of being Europe's most polluted river. 
</P>
<P>
The two-stroke motor vehicles on East German roads burn the cheapest form of 
gasoline and diesel oil, further contaminating the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Fritz Vahrenholt, an environment official in Hamburg, estimates that 100 
billion marks ($60 billion) will be needed over the next 10 years to clean up 
East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In his Spartan Bitterfeld office, Councilman Fromman showed a visitor letters 
from various Western European environmental firms offering suggestions and aid 
for cleaning up the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"I think help is coming," he said. "People live in Bitterfeld because of the 
higher wages and available housing. But 40,000 have left in 10 years, so there 
is a high turnover. This is a terrible state of affairs here. We need a new 
government to do something about pollution. 
</P>
<P>
"That is a reason why people want reunification (with West Germany). They 
believe that then the atmosphere and living conditions will improve."

CULTURES

A Vietnamese farmer and a Japanese nobleman play tag, while across the room a 
pair of Chinese schoolgirls collapse into giggles over their rice bowls. 
</P>
<P>
No, this isn't an Asian summit gone awry. It's just business as usual at 
"Passport to Asia," a hands-on exhibit at the La Habra Children's Museum. 
Designed for children in grades K-6, the show continues through March 24. 
</P>
<P>
Through a series of mostly participatory displays, "Passport to Asia" 
introduces kids to the customs and cultures of China, Japan and Vietnam. They 
can don kimonos and tabis (split-toe socks), count on an abacus, fold origami 
souvenirs and try to master the use of chopsticks. A gallery assistant is 
available to answer questions, and each weekday the museum offers eight group 
tours, including stops at the nature room, the historical train exhibit and the 
new theater and science galleries. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from recent visitors such as a second-grade class from La Palma's 
Ladera Palma school, "Passport to Asia" is an eye-opening experience for most 
grade-schoolers. Squirming in line as they waited for their tour guide, 
students were excited about the show, but a little foggy on its content. 
</P>
<P>
"Japan? It's, um, way over there," guessed 8-year-old Patrick Halstead, 
gesturing vaguely as he directed an elbow at a classmate's ribs. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas George, 7, was more confident: "Vietnam is down by China, right? I know 
because my dad was there." 
</P>
<P>
As the tour began, docent Carrie Wictor cleared up the question with a quick 
geography lesson, then moved on to an audience-participation fashion show. 
Selecting Patrick and 7-year-old Kandice Ludwick as her models, Wictor gave 
many of the kids their first look at traditional Asian costumes. 
</P>
<P>
"A kimono is a little bit like a bathrobe, but it's special," Wictor explained, 
wrapping the freckled girl in a red floral number that billowed over the girl's 
cowboy boots. Over his T-shirt and jeans, Patrick modeled a short cotton kimono 
and a white headband with a crimson rising sun. 
</P>
<P>
Then it was time for show-and-tell as Wictor pointed out a doll dressed in a 
traditional Vietnamese ao dai (a dress-like garment with split sides worn over 
flowing pants); a photo display on the art of jade and ivory carving; the tea 
ceremony and bonsai; and a collection of abacuses and soroban -- ancient Asian 
counting tools that Wictor compared to an electronic calculator. 
</P>
<P>
Standing beneath several colorful koi-fish kites, the youngsters learned of 
Japan's celebration of Children's Day, May 5. The kites, explained Wictor, are 
traditional Children's Day gifts for boys and are flown outside their homes 
that day. To remind them to be strong and brave, young men also receive a 
miniature samurai helmet, Wictor said. The girls in the visiting class enjoyed 
a collection of elegant Empress dolls, the traditional Children's Day gift for 
young women. 
</P>
<P>
Outfitted with these facts and figures, the kids were ready for some hands-on 
learning. Wictor conducted a workshop in the art of origami -- decorative 
paper-folding -- while several youngsters grappled with chopsticks, attempting 
with varying degrees of success to scoop cotton-ball "rice" from their bowls. 
Laughing at her fumbling fingers, Carly Moegling, 8, decided that although 
chopsticks were "weird, but fun," given the choice, she'd take a spoon. 
</P>
<P>
At the clothing display, the grade-schoolers were happily mixing cultures and 
costumes, topping off Japanese kimonos and geta (wooden "platform" shoes) with 
Vietnamese sun hats and Chinese parasols. 
</P>
<P>
Seven-year-old Adam Wheeler looked particularly regal, sweeping past his 
classmates in a dark kimono with a trailing hem. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you call these things -- cocoons? Oh yeah, kimonos," said Wheeler, 
waving his capacious sleeves. "It'd be cool to dress like this, especially when 
it's hot." 
</P>
<P>
The La Habra Children's Museum has supplemented "Passport to Asia" with a 
series of Asian-themed workshops and performances. Upcoming events include a 
March 17 show by the Nosho Miyagi Dancers, performing dances from the Okinawa 
region, and, on March 24, Chinese folk songs by the Little Panda Chorus, a 
children's choir. All shows are free with paid admission to the museum. 
"Passport to Asia," which opened Jan. 15, is one of several changing exhibits 
scheduled this year at the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "Passport to Asia" continues through March 24 at the La Habra Children's 
Museum, 301 S. Euclid St., La Habra. Hours are Monday through Saturday, 10 a.m. 
to 4 p.m. Admission is $1.50 for children and seniors, $2 for adults. Tours, 
available to groups of 10 or more, must be scheduled in advance. For 
information, call (213) 905-9793.

DIANNE KLEIN: SMALL-TIME NEWS OF KIDS PLUS GUNS EQUALS A BIG DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
John got a call a few weeks ago from some gang members in Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
"They said they were going to kick my butt," John says. "I guess some girl told 
them to call me." 
</P>
<P>
So he called his cousin, Carlos, who stole his father's gun and the ammo to 
make it kill. Carlos gave the gun to John, who took it to school, Fullerton's 
Ladera Vista Junior High. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really scared," Carlos says. 
</P>
<P>
John walked around school with the gun, a .38-caliber revolver, then handed it 
to his friend, Hector, who tucked it into his waistband. 
</P>
<P>
These guys were cool. These guys were bad. They say they were prepared to 
defend themselves. They say they meant no real harm. 
</P>
<P>
These boys are 12, 13 and 14 years old. The names that I've given them are not 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
They got caught by the principal, fingerprinted and photographed by police, and 
now they are each at home, released to their parents. They've been suspended 
from school. 
</P>
<P>
This, in the larger scheme of things, is not big-time news. No one was killed 
or physically hurt. 
</P>
<P>
The last time I wrote about kids' lethal cool was after Juan Cardenas, 12, 
killed his classmate, Jacalyn Calabrese, with a bullet to the head in the Mall 
of Orange. Juan said he didn't mean to. Now he's serving a year in Juvenile 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The Fullerton police say I shouldn't get the wrong idea. Most kids in Fullerton 
don't arm themselves for school. Here, they say, it's not like in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an isolated incident," says Sgt. Don Kimbro of the juvenile division. 
"It's not like it happens on a daily basis. During the course of a school year, 
I'd say we have about two or three incidents in the schools where there will be 
kids with guns. . . . These kids were playing the John Wayne thing." 
</P>
<P>
Kids, of course, have always played the John Wayne thing, even before John 
Wayne had a name. The difference today is that they use real guns, with live 
fire. Their cool has to really count; only babies bluff. 
</P>
<P>
Kimbro says he's talking low key so that I should not become unduly alarmed. He 
adds, however, that things really do seem to be getting uncomfortably close. 
</P>
<P>
"I have two little daughters who play Bobby Sox," he says. "Last season, we 
were at one of the softball games, and 15 minutes after we left, they arrested 
two kids with loaded handguns. Then it becomes a personal thing. I thought, 
'Holy Toledo, we were just there!' . . . A few days later, a kid points out 
these same guys to me, just walking across the park. They had taken them to 
Juvenile Hall and released them." 
</P>
<P>
John, Hector and Carlos, the kids at Ladera Vista Junior High, aren't in a 
gang, at least as far as police records show. They have no priors. 
</P>
<P>
Still, John says, joining the local Fullerton Toker Town, known as FTT on 
graffiti-strewn walls, might not be such a bad idea. A lot of his friends have 
already sworn the gang's oaths. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a good gang," John says. "Nothing happens there." 
</P>
<P>
How that translates is that nobody gets badly hurt, or at least according to 
John. Death at 13 years old is still something to fear. 
</P>
<P>
The school district has scheduled the boys' expulsion hearings for Monday. 
Teachers at the school say the principal announced that he would recommend that 
Hector and John, who are in the eighth grade, not be allowed to return, but 
that Carlos, in seventh-grade special education classes, come back in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
(Robert Taylor, the principal, says that he made no such announcement, 
"although that may have been something that has been discussed.") 
</P>
<P>
The Fullerton police, in the meantime, have written up these kids and passed 
their files to the probation department to decide what should be done next. It 
is highly unlikely that they will spend any time behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
Parents and teachers at Ladera Vista are still wondering how something like 
this could have happened in their own school. And they worry what kind of 
message will be sent if Carlos gets off easier than the rest. 
</P>
<P>
There is concern too that the disquieting news of a gun at school has leaked to 
those outside. It could, they fear, make them all look bad. 
</P>
<P>
"It upsets me that we have so many wonderful kids here, and then this happens 
and we get press," Robert Taylor says. "But I guess what I have to tell people 
is, 'Damn it, this is indicative of the times we are living in.' " 
</P>
<P>
It is worth repeating, I suppose, that this is really not big-time news -- just 
another "might have been" caught early enough. Yet it is neighborhood news, 
family news, that can happen where we all live -- in the schools, the park, in 
the bleachers where parents are watching their kids step up to bat. 
</P>
<P>
That is why I believe all of this must come out, no offense intended to Ladera 
Vista Junior High -- or to Parks Junior High or Nicolas Junior High, where 
three other Fullerton children also face expulsion for carrying weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Small-time news such as this may make us look bad, but maybe it can help to 
make us smart.

MAN CALLS POLICE TO SAY HE JUST 'KILLED A BABY';

Led to the scene by a man calling from a pay phone to say he had just "killed a 
baby," officers broke into an apartment early Saturday and found a 3-year-old 
girl dead, apparently stabbed repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
They also found a 9-month-old boy unharmed and took him into protective 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested Michael Robert Pacewitz, 21, a church acquaintance of the 
children's mother who reportedly had recently lost his job and reverted to 
using methamphetamine. Police said Pacewitz called police at 5:54 a.m., then 
waited to be arrested at a public telephone at Gilbert Street and Commonwealth 
Avenue, about a mile from the mother's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Upon taking Pacewitz into custody, police said they found a kitchen knife in 
one of his pants pockets. The suspect is being held in the city jail without 
bail, police said, and murder charges against him are expected to be filed 
Monday, with an arraignment to follow on Tuesday in Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Late Saturday, police still had been unable to locate the mother, Joanne 
Boydston. Friends said Boydston, in her mid-20s and unemployed, had gone the 
previous night to visit a friend, leaving the children in Pacewitz's care. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said that they had not clarified the relationship between 
Pacewitz and Boydston. Acquaintances of both said they did not know whether the 
two were romantically involved. 
</P>
<P>
According to one neighbor, Pacewitz "seemed to be one of those 'born-again' 
Christians. They (Pacewitz and Boydston) would be in the back talking gospel." 
</P>
<P>
Both are members of Jacob's Well Christian Centre, a Fullerton church that 
ministers to street people. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Town, pastor of the church, said Pacewitz was drawn into the 
congregation about a year ago when the church's outreach program encountered 
him and his mother living in a low-rent motel in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
"He and his mother came to the church one evening," Town said. "It was either 
that night or shortly after that he became saved." 
</P>
<P>
Pacewitz had had a history of frequent drug use, but he embraced religion, got 
a job and appeared to have stopped using drugs, Town said. 
</P>
<P>
But Pacewitz lost his job at a T-shirt store about three weeks ago, became 
depressed and began acting oddly, Town said. 
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, he exposed himself before the congregation during a revival 
meeting and later explained that he had resumed taking methamphetamines, 
popularly known as "crystal," Town said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was really into drugs, and we were just trying to get him to cope with 
life," Town said. "It all just blows my mind that this all came down, because 
he was doing so well. And then Thursday, he just flipped out and then went on 
down the road." 
</P>
<P>
Scott East, 27, whose apartment faces Boydston's, said he was awakened at 3:15 
a.m. Saturday by "a thumping sound -- boom, boom, boom. That's when somebody 
started yelling." 
</P>
<P>
He said he opened his front door and saw men who live below Boydston's 
apartment knocking on her door to check on the noise, but no one answered. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said the little girl's name was Marcelin and described her as 
blue-eyed with brownish-blond hair, usually unkempt, whose soles had turned 
black from constantly going barefoot. 
</P>
<P>
"She was always playing in the middle of the street," said one neighbor, 
Yolanda Velez. "She just wandered around like she didn't know where she was 
going." The girl seemed to be healthy, but "it looked like they didn't give her 
a bath," Velez said. Another neighbor, Ron Whitacre, 30, described her as "the 
sweetest little girl. She didn't shy away from people." 
</P>
<P>
Gwen Armstrong, 25, said she occasionally baby-sat for Boydston. She said 
Boydston always left the children with baby-sitters when she left but had never 
before stayed away from home so long. The girl would have crying fits when 
separated from her mother, Armstrong said.

DOCTORS SPLIT OVER PROTEST ON SPRAYING; 
</P>
<P>
MALATHION: A PROPOSED RESOLUTION OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSN. CALLING FOR A 
HALT TO THE AIRBORNE ATTACK ON THE MEDITERRANEAN FRUIT FLY IS CRITICIZED BY 
SOME DOCTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A proposed California Medical Assn. resolution calling for the immediate halt 
of malathion spraying was criticized by doctors Saturday, some of whom said the 
measure would cause needless public alarm and "paranoia" over a pesticide they 
insist has been proven safe. 
</P>
<P>
The comments from nearly a dozen doctors attending the CMA's annual meeting in 
Anaheim at the Disneyland Hotel marks the first public opposition by members of 
the association to the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
The measure will likely go before CMA delegates for a full vote on Tuesday, the 
day after a 26-square-mile section of Orange and Los Angeles counties is to be 
sprayed. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution, which alleges that the state has not proven the safety of the 
pesticide used in eradication of the Mediterranean fruit fly, was supported by 
two doctors at the CMA reference committee hearing. 
</P>
<P>
However, one by one, doctors from Orange County and around the state spoke out 
against the resolution, saying the chemical mixture used in the sprayings does 
not pose a health risk. 
</P>
<P>
"The malathion is extremely weak," said Kenneth Hayes, an association member 
from San Jose. "The CMA should not (get involved) in this mass hysteria." 
</P>
<P>
Several doctors noted that a series of studies found no long-term or short-term 
health hazards associated with normal exposure to the malathion mixture, which 
amounts to about 2.8 ounces of the pesticide per acre. While the chemical can 
be toxic to some insects and fish, state officials say it is not harmful to 
humans. 
</P>
<P>
"This issue has been discussed and decided," said CMA member Roger Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
If the CMA wants to get involved in the issue, one doctor suggested, it should 
try to ease the public's fears about malathion by going on record as saying 
that the spraying does not pose a health risk. 
</P>
<P>
A similar approach was taken in 1981 in Santa Clara County when a local medical 
association cooperated with state officials in attempting to allay residents' 
fears about Medfly spraying. 
</P>
<P>
The CMA does not have a formal position on malathion. When Santa Clara County 
faced spraying, the association decided the issue was a "matter best addressed" 
by local doctors, according to a CMA staff report. 
</P>
<P>
"If the CMA takes action on this . . . it says the doctors of California 
believe (malathion) is unsafe," said Alvin Markovitz, a member of the committee 
that heard the testimony. " . . . It sends the message that malathion is 
dangerous and a poison." 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the resolution have said the spraying should be stopped until 
malathion's effects can be assessed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not our burden to show that it's not safe," said H. Rex Greene, the 
Pasadena doctor who introduced the resolution. "The state must prove that it's 
safe." 
</P>
<P>
Greene was joined by Jerome Marmorstein, chairman of the CMA's Committee on 
Environmental and Occupational Health. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not comfortable with it," Marmorstein said. "It's a flagrant violation of 
human rights to be (sprayed) when (people) don't want it." 
</P>
<P>
Some doctors agreed that even if the spraying is a social issue, the medical 
association should not try to halt the practice if a health risk cannot be 
proven. 
</P>
<P>
The committee that heard testimony Saturday will likely recommend acceptance or 
rejection of the resolution when it is voted on by the 440-member House of 
Delegates. The committee can also make changes in the statement, which calls on 
the association's 38,000 members to write letters to state officials and 
lawmakers calling for a halt to spraying. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a top committee of CMA leaders agreed to let the resolution be 
discussed at the annual meeting. Officials believe the resolution is the first 
of its kind in the country to deal with malathion spraying. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy comes on the eve of another round of spraying in portions of 
Brea, La Habra and Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Helicopters are scheduled to fly over the area for the sixth time starting at 9 
p.m. Monday, according to Frank Parsons of the Orange County agricultural 
commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
The area will be sprayed as many as 12 times by the end of summer. A 36-mile 
area around Garden Grove and Westminster is scheduled to be sprayed for the 
third time on Thursday . 
</P>
<P>
Malathion foes plan a protest at the corner of Harbor and Garden Grove 
boulevards Thursday at 6 p.m. Bob Taylor, spokesman for Orange County Residents 
Against Malathion Spraying, said the group hopes to attract merchants and 
tourism officials who believe the sprayings are hurting business. 
</P>
<P>
MONDAY'S MEDFLY SPRAYINGS 
</P>
<P>
A 26-square-mile region of North Orange County and Los Angeles County will be 
sprayed with a pesticide mixture Monday night beginning at 9 as part of the 
state's ongoing battle against the Mediterranean fruit fly. The region includes 
a 10-square-mile area that was sprayed initially on Nov.30 and four times since 
then. The entire region will be sprayed between eight and 12 times, depending 
on weather conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The only other spray region in Orange County, covering 36 square miles around 
Garden Grove and Westminster, is scheduled for its third application on 
Thursday. Residents with questions can call the county's Medfly Hotline at 
(714) 447-7118.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: A MOTHER'S STORY OF CHILD LOST IN CHAOS BURNS INTO MEMORY

<P>
Mothers never forget. They remember their child's first walk and their first 
words. They tuck away these memories and never let them go. 
</P>
<P>
I met Rann Luk, the mother of five children, about a month ago for a story on 
Cambodian women. She will never let the memories of her child die. 
</P>
<P>
My story focused on Luk and nine other Cambodian mothers. They meet each 
Thursday to cope with the memories of losing their families during their 
country's fierce civil war. 
</P>
<P>
I heard about their meetings when I was pursuing another story in the Santa Ana 
neighborhood where they live. The women welcomed me by bowing, a Cambodian 
greeting. They fed me fruit punch and cookies and sat me on a chair in the 
middle of their circle. I listened to their discussion with the help of a 
translator. I watched their faces for their feelings. 
</P>
<P>
Luk had few words to share when I attended two of their meetings at the 
Neighborhood Service Center. She was not like Kim Yon, who liked talking about 
her shopping sprees at the dime shops. She was not like Yan On, who is learning 
English at age 54. Yan On enjoys throwing in an occasional English word during 
discussions to show off her newly learned skill. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Luk hardly spoke. When she did, it was always in a whisper. She was 
more of a listener. She only gave information when it was asked of her. But I 
remember looking into her face whenever someone else spoke. I saw pain in her 
eyes whenever memories were shared about the massacres in Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
I waited until the end of one meeting to talk to Luk. I asked her and two other 
women to stay so I could learn more about them. I wanted to know her story. 
</P>
<P>
Luk was very shy. But she wanted to share her story. Like the other women, she 
did not want the world to forget about the children, the ones missing, the ones 
killed in the terror of the Khmer Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
Luk told me about her son, 6-year-old Thoeung. He died more than 10 years ago, 
left alongside a granary. He had been beaten by Khmer Rouge soldiers after he 
had gone to get the family's daily ration of rice. Luk found her son's body 
when he did not return to their hut. She then had to bury him or face death 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
She told her story in short bursts, one sentence quickly after another. She 
stopped only to catch her breath or to wipe her tears with a paper towel. 
</P>
<P>
Stories like Rann Luk's write themselves. I bowed my goodbys to the women and 
went back to my office. I emptied her tale along with the others onto the 
computer screen. And my job as a reporter was seemingly done. 
</P>
<P>
Not exactly. 
</P>
<P>
After working on other stories, I can usually sleep easily at night. Press 
conferences and city council meetings do not replay themselves. 
</P>
<P>
But because of Luk's words, I saw her son's body bloodied and bruised. Because 
of her words, I heard her screams of grief. And through her words, I felt the 
pain of a mother who has lost a child. 
</P>
<P>
I hardly slept that night.

MIKE PENNER: MONARCH TRIO A PERFECT FIT

<P>
Gary McKnight carries a lot of weight around Mater Dei High School. Around his 
house, too, no doubt, especially in the kitchen, where his particular brand of 
weight training takes place every day. 
</P>
<P>
Suffice it to say, this coach is no Gary McLite. 
</P>
<P>
But the shadow McKnight casts is as figurative as it is literal, engulfing 
everything that is scarlet and gray and dribbles basketballs at the corner of 
Bristol and Edinger. 
</P>
<P>
So it's easy to forget about the men who sit alongside McKnight on the bench, 
Phil Bellomo and Dave Taylor -- or, as they are unofficially titled, the Mater 
Dei secretaries of offense and defense. 
</P>
<P>
Bellomo, the one with the bookish glasses and the loudest voice during team 
timeouts, coordinates the Monarch offense. Taylor, the one with the aging 
surfer looks, directs the defense. This combination has been in place since 
1983, and Saturday night it contributed to another Mater Dei Southern Section 
championship -- the school's sixth under McKnight. 
</P>
<P>
Bellomo and Taylor are also listed under McKnight, but only because someone has 
to placate boosters, meet the press and write in the starting lineup. This is a 
triumvirate in the truest sense. McKnight runs the Monarchs the way Bill Walsh 
used to run the San Francisco 49ers -- detached, with a firm belief that 
authority was meant to designated. 
</P>
<P>
"For a high school head coach, I think he's unusual," Taylor said, following 
Mater Dei's 83-57 victory over Loyola at the Los Angeles Sports Arena. "I don't 
know of any other high school coach who lets his assistants have this amount of 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a credit to him. He makes Phil and I feel so important to the 
program, we have to do a good job." 
</P>
<P>
Bellomo describes it as a major-college program atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"You see this kind of thing in a lot of college situations," Bellomo said. "At 
UNLV, their assistants are as active as you can find. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if what we do is really unique, but Gary is not someone who's 
into the 'He's-got-to-do-it-all' thing." 
</P>
<P>
Bellomo's offense has set standards for balanced efficiency this season. The 
Monarchs are 30-1 without one player averaging as many as 15 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's defense is yielding an average of just 45.5 points a game and 
Saturday, limited a Loyola team that scored 44 points in one quarter against 
St. Paul to a mere 57. 
</P>
<P>
McKnight, meanwhile, has blended the whole concoction into seven trips to the 
Southern Section finals in his eight seasons at Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
So, who's the brains behind this operation? 
</P>
<P>
Taylor simply smiles at the question and waits for the next one. 
</P>
<P>
Bellomo laughs and shakes his head. "You're not going to get me to say anything 
about that," he said. "We just have a real good coaching situation, a real good 
chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
"There's three of us and it works." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, 32, has been with McKnight from the start at Mater Dei. Their 
relationship began in Little League, with Taylor the player and McKnight the 
coach, and it developed into a working arrangement when McKnight was hired as 
the Monarchs' head coach in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Bellomo, 28, arrived a year later. McKnight recruited him off the campus of La 
Verne College. Among Bellomo's credentials: a part-time job in media relations 
with the Los Angeles Lakers. His duties include corraling players for halftime 
and postseason interviews with broadcasters Chick Hearn and Stu Lantz. He also 
sits next to Hearn at Laker home games and hands him notes that read: "The last 
time the Lakers held an opponent to under 90 points was . . . " 
</P>
<P>
This connection of Bellomo's has had an interesting trickle-down effect on the 
Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
"I get a lot of my ideas at those games," Bellomo said. "If a genie were to 
come out of a bottle and ask me what I wanted, I'd say, 'To be in that league.' 
I love that league -- the up-and-down pace, no zone defense, the wide-open 
style. 
</P>
<P>
"After '87, when we had to go from a post-oriented offense with LeRon (Ellis) 
to a perimeter-oriented offense, I tried to incorporate some of the things I 
saw while watching the Pistons and the Lakers. How Vinnie Johnson and Joe 
Dumars got open and how they adapted to different defenses. 
</P>
<P>
"That whole perspective helped me a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Bellomo ran a scaled-down version of Showtime at Loyola -- in 
essence, playing right into the opposition's strength. In style, Loyola and 
Loyola Marymount share more than a few syllables, but Bellomo didn't want any 
flinching in the face of the fast break, so he revved it up, too. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just as much a transition team as they are," Bellomo said. "We felt they 
couldn't play 94 feet with us on defense and play it for 32 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
A good hunch. By halftime, the Cubs were down by 17 points and dragging their 
tongues to the locker room with them. 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, Taylor devised a way to clamp down on Ryan Jamison, the Cubs' 6-11 
center of action, by full-fronting him and denying him the ball from the high 
post. 
</P>
<P>
"Jamison had six points," Taylor said with an amount of pride. "Obviously, we 
did what we wanted." 
</P>
<P>
McKnight has a good thing going, no doubt, but for how long? How much longer 
before Bellomo and Taylor start to yearn for a high-school program to call 
their own? 
</P>
<P>
For the moment, both claim to be content with the small type. 
</P>
<P>
"To be a head coach," Bellomo said, "you've got to deal with a lot of politics. 
I love basketball, not politics. Gary lets me do basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor seconds that motion, with one addendum. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the winning is fun," he points out. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously. There's always that.

2-A BOYS' FINAL: ARTISTS MISS FIVE FREE THROWS, INCLUDING FRONT ENDS OF THREE 
ONE-AND-ONES, IN FINAL MINUTES OF 70-68 LOSS TO ST. JOSEPH HIGH.

<P>
St. Joseph High School won its first Southern Section 2-A boys' basketball 
championship Saturday at the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
At Laguna Beach's free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Cavazos scored 20 of his game-high 32 points in the second half as St. 
Joseph of Santa Maria rallied from a 14-point deficit to beat Laguna Beach, 
70-68, at the Los Angeles Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest factor late in the game was Laguna Beach's inability to make 
free throws. The Artists missed five free throws, including the front end of 
three one-and-ones, in the final 1 minute 29 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach also missed two other opportunities to win the game. Guard Josh 
Borella lost the ball out of bounds on a baseline drive with five seconds left 
and center Dain Blanton missed a running 22-footer at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought in the last two minutes the game was ours," Laguna Beach Coach Ed 
Bowen said. "All we had to do was win it at the free-throw line." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, St. Joseph, which lost four of its first six games this season, 
improved to 20-7. Laguna Beach, making its first championship game appearance 
since 1963, finished at 22-6. 
</P>
<P>
"After that 2-4 start I thought we were in for a long season," St. Joseph Coach 
Richard King said. "But things came together. We scored 100 in four of our last 
six games. The closer we got to the championship, the better we played." 
</P>
<P>
St. Joseph led, 69-67, after Cavazos' free throw with 1:28 left. 
</P>
<P>
Borella, who scored 18 of his team-high 25 points in the first half, missed the 
front end of a one-and-one with 1:17 left to start the Artists' struggle from 
the line. 
</P>
<P>
Borella, a 78% foul shooter, made only two of five free throws in the last 
1:29. 
</P>
<P>
Borella made the first of two free throws with 50 seconds left to cut the 
deficit to 69-68. The Artists had two chances to tie and take the lead, but 
John Trevino missed the front end of a one-and-one and Blanton missed two free 
throws in the final 30 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
The Artists had made nine of 12 free throws before the fourth quarter, but made 
only seven of 14 thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
Borella had one last chance to make up for his poor foul shooting. He drove to 
the baseline with five seconds left, but lost the ball out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
Borella said he thought he was fouled by St. Joseph's Paul Santana, who had 
reached around him and knocked the ball free. 
</P>
<P>
"He slapped the ball and I thought he got my wrist, too," Borella said. 
</P>
<P>
Bowen, who said he was shielded from the play, said he was surprised Borella 
lost the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"Josh is probably our best ballhandler," Bowen said. "He normally doesn't lose 
the ball like that." 
</P>
<P>
St. Joseph's Spencer MacCuish was fouled on the in-bounds play and made the 
front end of a one-and-one to push the lead to 70-68. Blanton's desperation 
shot at the buzzer bounced off the backboard without touching the rim. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach led, 39-32, at halftime and had a 53-39 lead with 4:15 left in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Then Cavazos took over. 
</P>
<P>
He scored seven points to spark a 12-4 run and cut the deficit to 57-51 at the 
end of the third quarter. He pulled down four of his game-high 14 rebounds in 
the quarter. Ten of his rebounds were on the offensive end and St. Joseph 
outrebounded Laguna Beach, 52-37. 
</P>
<P>
"Cavazos did his job," Bowen said. "We lost it because we were a little tired 
and we didn't hit our free throws. I'm disappointed that our free throws didn't 
go down, but I'm not disappointed in the way we played." 
</P>
<P>
St. Joseph had scored more than 100 points in two of its previous three playoff 
games using a pressing defense and a running offense patterned after Loyola 
Marymount's. 
</P>
<P>
"Their quickness wasn't there and their 100-point press wasn't there," Bowen 
said. "Their press didn't hurt us a lick." 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach committed only 11 turnovers to St. Joseph's 20. 
</P>
<P>
"I read where St. Joseph was going to blow us out with (its) press," Bowen 
said. "I laughed. We beat the devil out of their press."

UNLV SLOWS IT DOWN, BUT STILL LEAVES TITANS IN THE DUST

<TEXT>
<P>
There were so many little acts of kindness by Nevada Las Vegas Saturday, and 
they made so little difference. 
</P>
<P>
The Runnin' Rebels played some zone defense and they held the ball at times 
when points were there for the taking. 
</P>
<P>
There was none of that famous UNLV full-court man-to-man pressure, and precious 
little intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
Little, that is, other than the sort that comes from watching a team that makes 
domination look like a matter of course, as UNLV did in a 103-85 victory over 
Cal State Fullerton in front of a sellout crowd of 4,000 in Titan Gym. 
</P>
<P>
Even UNLV's Greg Anthony seemed mild, and he is a trash-talker of such ability 
that he has been called for two technicals in the past three games even though 
his broken jaw is wired together. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels were road-weary by the time they played their fourth game this week. 
But they still ran away from Fullerton in the first half, going up by as many 
as 23 points while making 68% of their shots, many of them fast-break layups. 
</P>
<P>
"We were running really well and that's what blew the game open for us," UNLV 
Coach Jerry Tarkanian said. 
</P>
<P>
They weren't running hard so much as well. UNLV could jog down on a two-on-two 
break; no matter, the Rebels' passing was sharp enough to get the basket. 
</P>
<P>
"We just couldn't stop their running game," said Fullerton's Cedric Ceballos, 
whose own style thrives on an up-and-down game. He scored 34 points, tying his 
career high. "I guess that's why they call them the Runnin' Rebels. They ran, 
and we couldn't run with them. We run, too, but we don't run like that." 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels run at the slightest occasion. 
</P>
<P>
"They run of the made shot, off the miss, off their defense on a turnover," 
Fullerton Coach John Sneed said. "We couldn't keep them in a halfcourt game." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (12-15 overall, 6-12 in the Big West Conference), a once-promising 
team, finished the regular season by losing seven games in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"We are disappointed after this loss, like we are after any loss," Sneed said. 
"Now we have to practice well to get ready for the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
UNLV, led by David Butler's 26 points and Anderson Hunt's 22, shot 65% for the 
game and became the first team to score 100 points against Fullerton since 
1980, when Portland scored 100 in the first game of a 4-23 Titan season. 
</P>
<P>
And the Runnin' Rebels didn't even try that hard to do it. Many a team will 
rush pell-mell toward the basket when it has 99 points. UNLV, leading 99-85 
with more than a minute left, played keep-away until David Moody fouled Butler, 
sending him to the line for points 100 and 101. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels (26-5, 16-2), ranked second in the Associated Press poll before 
being upset by UC Santa Barbara Monday, will enter next week's Big West 
tournament as the second-seeded team for the first time in the eight years they 
have been in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
This is also the first time UNLV has ever shared the conference title. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State, which tied for first place with a 16-2 record, is seeded 
first because it beat third-place Santa Barbara twice, while the Rebels split 
with the Gauchos. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care so much what we're seeded in the Big West tournament," Tarkanian 
said. "I'll be very interested in where we're seeded in the big tournament (the 
NCAA)." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton will play UC Irvine in the first round Wednesday, with the winner 
meeting UNLV Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The game marked the end of a UNLV regular season marked by controversy and 
injuries, and one that included a number of suspensions for minor NCAA rules 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
Just Thursday, the Rebels played at Utah State in a rematch of last month's 
fight-marred game. The game was without much incident, but a water bomb was 
left near the UNLV bench, where it exploded before the second half, drenching 
Tarkanian. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a really hard season," said Larry Johnson, who scored 11 Saturday. 
"All the distractions off the court took their toll. The five games we lost, we 
lost. But we didn't lay down. . . . This was a good game for us." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton's five seniors were honored before their final game in 
Titan Gym: Van Anderson, Cedric Ceballos, Mark Hill, David Moody and Marlon 
Vaughn. Anderson and Vaughn, who are normally reserves, joined the others in 
the starting lineup. . . . Hill set the school career record for 
three-pointers, breaking Richard Morton's record of 140. Hill had two Saturday 
for a total of 141.

Gary Gray scored 20 points and Eric McArthur added 18 to lead UC Santa Barbara 
over San Jose State, 77-76, in a Big West Conference game Saturday night at San 
Jose. 
</P>
<P>
Carrick DeHart hit a 12-foot jump shot from the right baseline with 21 seconds 
remaining to give UC Santa Barbara a 77-73 lead and seal its third consecutive 
20-win season. 
</P>
<P>
The Gauchos improved to 20-7 in the conference and 13-5 overall. 
</P>
<P>
Troy Batiste of San Jose State (8-19 and 5-13) hit a three-point field goal at 
the buzzer, cutting the Gauchos margin of victory to 77-76. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 58-55 with 9:10 remaining, McArthur and Gray sparked a 9-0 run that 
keyed the victory for UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
McArthur, the NCAA Division I leading rebounder at 13.6 a game, threw down a 
thunderous dunk to start the run, and Gray -- with 14 points in the second half 
-- hit a hook shot on the baseline and scored on a offensive rebound after a 
missed free throw. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Brooks led San Jose State, who had four players in double figures, with 
16 points.

Florida State 79, South Carolina 70 -- Tharon Mayes, playing in only his second 
game in a month, scored 25 points, including four free throws in the final 
minute, to lead the Seminoles to the Metro Conference win at Columbia, S.C.

Mayes, who was suspended for seven games by Florida State Coach Pat Kennedy for 
an on-campus altercation, scored 13 points in the final 8:10 as the Seminoles 
(16-14, 6-8) held off a pair of late rallies by the Gamecocks. 
</P>
<P>
The loss dropped South Carolina (13-13, 6-8) into a tie with Florida State for 
fifth place in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
MIDWEST 
</P>
<P>
Indiana 70, Wisconsin 68 -- Calbert Cheaney made a 15-foot jump shot with two 
seconds left to give the Hoosiers the Big Ten victory at Madison, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
Cheaney's basket, which came with two defenders hanging on him, capped a 10-0 
Indiana rally over the last 3:11. After a pair of timeouts, Wisconsin's Kurt 
Portmann threw a baseball pass to Tim Locum. Locum took the pass just past 
midcourt, but his shot fell short. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana is 17-9 overall and 7-9 in the Big Ten. Wisconsin is 14-16 and 4-13. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 89, DePaul 79 -- Lance Blanks scored 30 points at Rosemont, Ill., to help 
the Longhorns extend their winning streak to five games. 
</P>
<P>
The game was tied, 69-69, with 7:10 left when Joey Wright drove the baseline 
for a layup to give Texas (20-6) a lead it never relinquished. Texas earlier 
appeared to have the game well in hand. The Blue Demons trailed, 66-56, with 
13:22 remaining. But a 10-0 DePaul run midway through the second half tied the 
game, 66-66, with 9:17 left. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Howard's 25 points led DePaul (16-14), whose hopes of getting an 
at-large berth in the NCAA tournament were hurt by the defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Ball State 84, Central Michigan 57 -- The easy victory at Muncie, Ind., enabled 
the Cardinals to become the first team to win consecutive regular-season 
Mid-American Conference titles since Bowling Green in 1961 and 1962. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler Thompson and Billy Butts each scored five points during a 12-2 run 
that gave Ball State (21-6, 13-3) a 58-38 lead with 8:35 left. A 14-3 run in 
which Thompson scored six points extended the lead to 74-48 with 3:09 left. 
</P>
<P>
The Chippewas (11-16, 6-10) stayed close in the first half and trailed 37-30 at 
halftime.

SDSU CONTINUES DOWNWARD SPIRAL, LOSES

<P>
In a Western Athletic Conference basketball contest featuring a pair of teams 
headed in opposite directions, the end result was, well, predictable. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, San Diego State -- losers of seven straight WAC contests coming in 
-- dropped a 62-45 decision to Colorado State Saturday night, extending the 
Rams' winning streak to five out of their last six. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs complete the season 4-12 in the conference and 13-17 overall and 
finish as the WAC's eighth seed. As a result, SDSU will face Air Force in the 
WAC tournament eighth-place contest Wednesday night in El Paso, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, Colorado State (21-7, 11-5) finishes as the No. 1 seed and will 
meet Wednesday's night's winner. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it was the Aztecs who gained a moral victory in the first half Saturday 
night after battling the Rams to a virtual standstill before 9,871 surprised 
Moby Arena fans. 
</P>
<P>
A late Mark Meredith three-pointer gave Colorado State a 29-23 halftime lead, 
but it was SDSU that headed into the locker room feeling vindicated. 
</P>
<P>
"We were loose coming in here; we knew we could come right out and play with 
them," said center Shawn Jamison, who scored 16 points. "There were some high 
hopes for the second half but they (Colorado State) took it over right away." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the Ram eruption came four minutes into the half. After a Jamison 
layup narrowed the Colorado State margin to 33-32, the Rams embarked on a 17-5 
run over the next seven minutes to dig the Aztecs a 13-point grave. 
</P>
<P>
After nine early points in the half, the Aztec offense went into a tail-spin, 
scoring just nine points in one 13 minute span. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs finished with a 18-of-49 performance from the floor while the Rams 
were slightly better at 19-of-52. 
</P>
<P>
Still, SDSU coach Jim Brandenburg preferred to give the Rams the credit. 
</P>
<P>
"They simply got the job done and completely outplayed us," he said. "They 
hustled and played like the league champions they are in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State coach Boyd Grant, however, wasn't as enthralled with his squad's 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
"We struggled a bit tonight; we never completely established ourselves except 
for stretches in the second half," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I can only hope we'll play better in El Paso." 
</P>
<P>
One telling factor in SDSU's second-half drought was the loss of guard Michael 
Best, who fouled out of the contest with 8:45 remaining. The senior finished 
with a team-high 17 points -- including a three-of-six performance from 
three-point territory. 
</P>
<P>
"That one really hurt," said Brandenburg, who waged a game-long battle with 
officials and drew his first technical foul of the season in the first half. 
"Michael was having one of his better games of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"When he went out, we had to focus on getting it inside to Jamison and we just 
couldn't do it because they (Colorado State) knew that was our only realistic 
option at that point." 
</P>
<P>
Meredith, the Rams' junior guard, also put a dent in the SDSU strategy with his 
outside accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
With the Aztecs mainly concentrating on center Mike Mitchell, the Rams' leading 
scorer, Meredith finished with a game high 22 points, including a quartet of 
three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, meanwhile, finished with 17, hitting four of 11 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Meredith) caught us a little off guard," said Best of Meredith. "We were 
focusing inside on Mitchell but that guy lit it up from outside. He sure didn't 
put it up like that earlier this year (a 64-57 Colorado State win on Feb. 18)." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Best said the Aztecs are prepared for a Colorado State rematch in the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"We're concentrating 100% on Air Force right now, but I think we'll have a good 
shot at Colorado State on a neutral floor. 
</P>
<P>
"For one thing, we sure don't want to end the year having lost to one team 
three times in a season."

PACIFIC CHRISTIAN FALLS IN BASKETBALL FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Welch scored 22 points and Brian Keiser, the tournament's most valuable 
player, added 19, but Pacific Christian College lost to Maranatha Baptist, 
114-96, in the championship game of the National Christian College Athletic 
Assn. tournament Saturday in Baton Rouge, La. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Vincent, who played for Esperanza in High School and was also named to the 
all-tournament team, scored 15 points for Pacific Christian. 
</P>
<P>
Terrell Cannon had 33 points for Maranatha Baptist (22-7), the tournament's 
second-seeded team. Pacific Lutheran, the top-seeded team, finished the season 
at 28-10. 
</P>
<P>
In Big West Conference women's basketball: 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton 63, San Jose State 54 -- The Titans built a 33-23 halftime 
lead at Titan Gym, but San Jose State cut the deficit to 54-52 with two minutes 
left. Then Titan junior center Genia Miller scored on a layup with 1:50 left to 
make it 56-52 and Fullerton pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (14-13, 9-9) finished fifth in the Big West Conference and will play 
fourth-place Fresno State Thursday in the conference tournament at Long Beach 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Miller finished with 22 points and 15 rebounds, and she hit four of six free 
throws to set a school record of 163 free throws made in a season. She set the 
previous record of 161 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Titan forward Jill Matyuch scored 17 points and guard Jeannine Battaglia had a 
career-high 11 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Lora Alexander scored 27 points for San Jose State (4-23, 2-16). 
</P>
<P>
In nonconference women's softball: 
</P>
<P>
UC Riverside 6-4 Southern California College 0-0 -- Tori Serapion's single was 
the only hit for host SCC (8-6) in Saturday's second game. Debbie Perry pitched 
a one-hitter. In the first game, Riverside's Julie Fay pitched a six-hitter. 
Stephanie Wills of SCC had a single and double in the opener. 
</P>
<P>
In the University of New Mexico women's tennis tournament: 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma 9, UC Irvine 0 -- Only Stacey Cadigan, who lost, 7-6, 7-5, at No. 1 
singles to Stacey Bullman, came close to a victory for the Anteaters (5-11) in 
the semifinals at Albuquerque. The Anteaters will play New Mexico for third 
place at 12:30 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
In a nonconference track meet between Cal State Northridge, Stanford and host 
UC Irvine: 
</P>
<P>
Stanford won both the men's and women's team competitions. Mel Bloch of 
Stanford outraced Irvine's Buffy Rabbit in the women's 1500- and 800-meter 
races and Stanford's Marcus Hickerson won the men's 400 meters and long jump. 
Matt Farmer jumped 7-foot 1/2-inch to win the high jump and Mike Morales won 
the hammer throw (204-7) as the Irvine men finished third in the tri-meet. 
Marieke Veltman won the long jump for the Irvine women, who also finished

FOOTLOOSE: HISTORIC ANTALYA IS FAVORED FOR SURF AND SAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Antalya, Turkey 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Alexander the Great swept toward Persia in the 3rd Century BC, he leveled 
just about everything and everyone who stood in his path, including the town 
and belligerent people of Perge near here. The more sagacious citizens of 
Aspendosa, a bit farther inland, met him with open arms and were spared, even 
selling him 4,000 of their magnificent horses. 
</P>
<P>
While not as old as other historic Turkish cities that once lined the 
Aegean-Mediterranean seas, Antalya still cannot be missed by anyone visiting 
the Turquoise Coast. An hour or so in the town's archeological museum is alone 
worth a stop here. 
</P>
<P>
A leisurely walk through the handsome museum halls exposes one to Anatolian 
history, from neolithic artifacts to Hellenic and Roman era treasures to a 
fascinating display of the nomadic tent life still led by some Turkish Gypsy 
tribes. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are no great beaches within the town proper, there's enough surf 
and sand nearby to make Antalya favored by Europeans as the Turkish Rivera. But 
the main reasons for visiting are still the museum, the delightfully preserved 
Old Harbor area and the magnificent ruins of nearby Perge, Aspendos and, to a 
lesser degree, Side. 
</P>
<P>
Getting here: Fly British Airways, Pan Am, Lufthansa, KLM or SAS to Istanbul, 
then Turkish Airways on to Antalya in an hour. 
</P>
<P>
How long/how much? Give Antalya a day, with another for visits to Perge and 
Aspendos, and three if you add Side. Lodging costs are low to moderate, while 
dining on marvelous Turkish food is down-right cheap. 
</P>
<P>
A few fast facts: Turkey's lira recently sold at 1,934 to the dollar. Arrive 
anytime betweenJune and October, with June-July the hottest months. And stick 
to bottled water everywhere, even in the best hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Getting settled in: Club Hotel Sera (on the edge of town; $84-$105 B&amp;B 
double) is new and enormous, a modern place near the sea with a gigantic 
terrace and pool. It also has tennis courts, suana, fitness center and casino. 
Large bedrooms have every amenity, but we felt that management still had work 
to do before the Sera could be considered a truly first-class hotel. Among 
other things, the rugs were soiled and employees were not knowledgeable enough 
about the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel Lara (seven miles from town; $48 double B&amp;B, $60 half-pension for 
two) hugs a cliff over its terrace dining area, pool and private beach. 
Contemporary bedrooms are basic but neat, some with balconies, all with fairly 
small baths. A big factor at the Lara are the wonderful sea breezes that 
whistle through the place at all hours. This one is a great bargain. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel Yayla (12 Ali Cetinkaya Cad.; $47 B&amp;B double) is also a bargain, if 
you don't mind a location at mid-city. It's a small and totally without 
pretension, but the owner and staff are as friendly as anyone could hope for. 
Bedrooms are also small, simple and very neat, and baths have only a shower. 
Yayla is a good spot for those who want to be right in the middle of things, 
with good restaurants, doner kebab cafes and shopping nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Regional food and drink: Seafood along this coast is just about as good as 
you'll find anywhere, and yogurt lovers will be in paradise. 
</P>
<P>
Guvec is a heavenly mix of veal, peppers, eggplant, tomatoes and other local 
vegetables, all mixed and cooked in an earthen pot. Mucver is yet another great 
treatment of vegetables, this time fried into patties and served as a first 
course. And the mixed-vegetable salads are always a colorful adventure. 
</P>
<P>
Lamb is ever at hand in the form of shish or doner kebabs, kofte (spicy 
meatballs) or in ragouts, while the best fish are sea bas, red mullet 
(barbunya) and sturgeon. 
</P>
<P>
Luscious Turkish desserts need no hard sell, but the Barok white wine from the 
Marmara region struck us as first-rate, a pleasant surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Good dining: The finest Turkish meal of our trip was served beautifully at 
Belkis (near Aspendos ruins), a lovely river-side restaurant that draws locals 
in droves for that special occasion. The dolmas (eggplant, peppers, tomatoes 
and grape leaves stuffed with rice, pine nuts, spices, and tiny grapes) got us 
off to a great start. 
</P>
<P>
We then had superb kebabs of Aegean tuna with thin slices of lemon, sage and 
green pepers, plus two bottles of wine, baklava and plump fresh figs. The total 
tab was $36 for three. So "afiyet olsun" (bon apetit) and enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
If a craving for kebabs hits you, head straight for Eski Sebzeciler, a small 
street near town center running into Ataturk Caddesi, the main drag. The entire 
block is a covered arcade lined with cafes serving kebabs, kofte, guvec, salads 
and turkish pastries. You'll eat like a bandit here for less than $2 and have 
plenty of fun to boot. 
</P>
<P>
On your own: Aspendos (28 miles northeast of Antalya) was probably founded by 
Greeks after the Trojan Wars (1194-84 BC), became a Roman colony and flourished 
about AD 133, then fell into decline. It has a magnificient aqueduct, and the 
Roman theater, which seated 20,000, is probably the best preserved from 
antiquity. 
</P>
<P>
Perge (11 miles northeast of Antalya) was founded by Greeks about the same time 
as Aspendos, and also came under the rule of Rome, which produced two sets of 
walls around the town. Little is left of the acropolis, nor of the basilica 
built for St. Paul, who came from Cyprus and converted the city to 
Christianity. But the remians of markets, forums, gymnasiums, a 10,000-seat 
theater and wide, porticoed streets still give one an idea of the vital city 
that once stood here. 
</P>
<P>
Ruins hopping: Getting around on the southern coast of Anatolia, and 
understanding the ruins' history, isn't all that easily done. We recommend that 
you book a tour or cruise with knowledgeable guides and lecturers. 
Swan-Hellenic Cruises at toll-free (800)426-5492, or Tursem Tours at 
(800)223-9169, will both send brochures outlining their itineraries and costs. 
</P>
<P>
For more information: Call the Culture &amp; Information Attache, Turkish 
Consulate General, at (212) 687-2194, or write (821 United Nations Plaza, New 
York 10017) for a brochure on the Aegean-Mediterranean coast, plus a map of 
Turkey and travel guide with hotel listing. Ask for the Antalya package.

"The Cosby Show" on Feb. 12 featuring outtakes from the series was the funniest

do one yearly show of outtakes instead of one rerun. Come on, everyone -- 
follow Bill Cosby's lead.

I am writing CBS in addition to you to let everyone know that I will be 
boycotting "60 Minutes" for the next three months, along with the rest of my 
family, due to its ridiculous suspension of Andy Rooney (the best part of the 
show). Should CBS lift its "ban" on Rooney, I'll be glad to tune right back in.

I am furious that my favorite program, "Sunday Morning," is constantly shown at 
different times. On Feb. 11, it was listed at 7:30 a.m. I got up to find it 
started at 6 a.m. and ended at 7:30 a.m. I would set my VCR if CBS would be 
consistent or give some notice about the scheduling.

WORDS OF WARNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To all network and local TV programmers: It's 1990 and it's time to wake up! We 
viewers aren't going to consume the same compost you keep shoveling our way 
year in and year out. In case you haven't noticed, there's this swell thing 
called cable that offers a lot more than you. 
</P>
<P>
How many times do you need to hear, "Those who forget history are condemned to 
repeat it"? Remember the studio film geniuses who arrogantly thought TV could 
never compete with them in the early '50s? 
</P>
<P>
We can now watch reruns of shows like "Car 54," cultural documentary series on 
KCET, better movies on A&amp;E, Bravo and American Movie Classics. We no longer 
want or need your Mr. Belvedere mentality turning our brains into vegetable 
soup.

HIS GOAL IS TO SCORE THEM IN WORLD CUP; 
</P>
<P>
SOCCER: WYNALDA MOVES UP FROM DEVELOPMENTAL SQUAD TO STRIKE A BLOW FOR U.S. 
NATIONAL TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His first appearance in a screaming headline occurred 12 years ago when a 
Thousand Oaks newspaper stretched this banner across the top of the sports 
page: "Eric Wynalda -- Soccer Figure at 8." 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Eric's father, David, was surprised by the headline and felt Eric 
really didn't deserve being singled out. Sure, Eric scored 56 goals in leading 
his youth soccer team to a state championship season, "but we thought he was 
just having fun out there. We didn't see him as special," David says. 
</P>
<P>
However, the reporter who wrote the story accompanying the headline was an 
Irish-born soccer expert, David says, "who recognized the things in Eric that 
we couldn't see." 
</P>
<P>
Today, it no longer takes a trained eye to determine that Eric is special. 
Always a prodigious scorer -- 88 goals in three varsity seasons at Westlake 
High and Southern Section 4-A Division offensive player of the year -- Wynalda 
is a strong candidate for the U.S. national team that will compete in the World 
Cup starting June 10 in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
"Eric is a gifted athlete," U.S. Coach Bob Gansler says. 
</P>
<P>
Currently considered the team's No. 1 striker, Wynalda started at forward in 
the last four exhibitions, including a 3-1 loss to the Soviet Union before an 
estimated crowd of 61,000 in Palo Alto last week, and just signed a contract 
with the U.S. Soccer Federation. His presence in the lineup, Gansler says, 
"adds some attacking flair to our team." 
</P>
<P>
But despite Wynalda's scoring skills, his status is surprising -- he wasn't on 
the national team until January. While strikers such as Peter Vermes and Brent 
Goulet were helping the United States to its stunning performance in World Cup 
qualifying last year, Wynalda was playing for the national developmental 
B-team. It took six months before Wynalda was able to move up to the big team. 
</P>
<P>
"Eric caught our attention when he was working with the B-team," Gansler says. 
"We knew he was a talent." 
</P>
<P>
Gansler wanted Wynalda to join the national team for a game against the Soviets 
in Philadelphia last August, but he came down with mononucleosis. The disease 
laid him up for two months and prevented his starting the collegiate season on 
time at San Diego State. In late December, Gansler called Eric at his parents' 
Westlake Village home and asked him to attend a two-week training camp in La 
Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
Wynalda, 6-1, 170, with long sandy-colored hair, was one of 28 players Gansler 
brought to camp. Most of the country's top strikers -- including some who play 
professionally abroad -- were there, but Wynalda stood out "and started to 
shine," Gansler says. By the end of camp, Gansler said Wynalda was his top 
striker but needed international experience. 
</P>
<P>
Wynalda went to Miami with the national team for the Marlboro Cup matches in 
January. But Gansler started a midfielder, Hugo Perez, ahead of Wynalda in the 
opening game against Costa Rica, and Perez played the first 45 minutes in a 2-0 
loss. Wynalda played the last 15 minutes, "made an impact," he says, and 
Gansler told him he had earned a chance to start against Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
Four minutes into the Colombia game, Wynalda, at 20 the youngest starter in the 
lineup, took a pass and went in alone on the Colombian goalkeeper, beating him 
with a quick shot for the only U.S. goal in a 1-1 tie. 
</P>
<P>
But Wynalda doesn't have a lock on a starting job or even a guaranteed backup 
role on the World Cup team. Gansler isn't going to name the final 22-man roster 
until May, after several more international exhibitions. And, according to 
Gansler, Wynalda still needs to improve. 
</P>
<P>
"At times he looks very, very good, and at times he gets caught with his 
concentration waning," Gansler says. "Technically he's fine, but he has to get 
better on the tactical end of things." Then Gansler adds, "I'm betting that 
he's going to get it done." 
</P>
<P>
Wynalda's next test will be March 10 against Finland in Tampa, Fla. "Coach 
Gansler always tells us, 'You're only as good as your last performance,' " 
Wynalda says. "That saying always goes off in my mind. I know if I have a bad 
game he'll give someone else a look." 
</P>
<P>
Most experts say that the problem with American soccer is the lack of skillful 
finishers, players who can score goals. Wynalda is a rare exception, says Chuck 
Clegg, soccer coach at San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
"Eric's ability to take on a player one-on-one is the best I've ever seen in an 
American," Clegg says. "And to have developed this skill with a purely American 
experience is very unusual." 
</P>
<P>
Wynalda learned to play in the American Youth Soccer Organization. When he was 
5 and his brother Brandt was 7, they joined an AYSO team coached by their 
father. The team's assistant coach was Italian-born Tino Forino, who spoke 
little English but knew how to play the European way. 
</P>
<P>
"Eric was inspired by Tino," says David, who owns a soccer specialty shop in 
Westlake Village. "The kids didn't understand much of what he was saying, but 
he still taught them the basics." 
</P>
<P>
In his junior year at Westlake High, Wynalda was coached by another European, a 
former player from Austria named Rudi Fedimeyer, who was studying American 
soccer for his doctorate degree. Fedimeyer helped refine Wynalda's techniques, 
and by the time Eric enrolled at San Diego State, he was "one of the most 
skillful players we've ever had," Clegg says. 
</P>
<P>
Wynalda stayed at San Diego only three seasons. In his freshman year, he scored 
the winning goal against UCLA in the NCAA Division I tournament quarterfinal 
and led the Aztecs into the final, where they lost to Clemson, 1-0. But last 
December, after the season, Wynalda decided to drop out of school and forgo his 
senior year of soccer. 
</P>
<P>
Only a handful of Americans currently play first division soccer elsewhere in 
the world, but Wynalda made strong connections when he and Aztec teammate 
Marcello Balboa played in a farewell game for Brazilian soccer star Zico last 
December in Brazil. Wynalda says he has offers to play first-division soccer in 
Spain and Holland. 
</P>
<P>
His priority, however, is making the U.S. World Cup team. "I'm very confident 
that I can do some very good things for the team," he says. "I think I bring an 
element of unpredictability to the attack." 
</P>
<P>
A major underdog in the 24-nation tournament, the United States is grouped with 
Czechoslovakia, Austria and host Italy in the opening round. But Wynalda says 
the United States is no longer a pushover. He points out that the national team 
was 8-18-9 in international games in 1988 and 18-6-3 last year. 
</P>
<P>
"That has a lot to do with the confidence we have in ourselves as a soccer 
nation," he says. "We don't go on the field any more trying just to hold our 
own. We expect to win and we don't feel overwhelmed. We don't say, 'Oh, we're 
playing Brazil,' and panic. 
</P>
<P>
"In the qualifying rounds we proved we could play defense. Now we have to 
generate a consistent attack."

LARRY ROBINSON ALMOST AFRAID TO TOUCH THE PUCK

<P>
Larry Robinson has heard the taunts more than once this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, ya bum," a fan will bellow from the safety of his seat, "why don't you 
retire?" 
</P>
<P>
It hurts as much the recent rash of costly turnovers Robinson has committed. 
</P>
<P>
It hurts as much as the collapse of his Kings into fourth place in the Smythe 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
It hurts as much as the aches and pains he sometimes feels in a body that has 
been subjected to the rigors of playing defenseman in professional hockey for 
20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the fan's question is a reasonable one. 
</P>
<P>
Why, after 19 years in the Montreal Canadiens' organization and a career filled 
with Stanley Cups, awards and adulation as one of the game's great defensemen, 
didn't he retire last summer instead of starting all over again in Los Angeles 
at age 38? 
</P>
<P>
"Because the thing that scares me," Robinson said, "is to have told people 
that's it and then to have realized I should have played one more year. People 
who have gone through it tell me I should play as long as I can, because once 
you're out, it's too late." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it didn't hurt that Robinson, having become a free agent, had a 
three-year, $1.65-million contract waved in front of him by King owner Bruce 
McNall last summer. The deal, for two seasons with an option year, pays 
Robinson $550,000 this season. 
</P>
<P>
But when he signed, Robinson didn't exactly feel elated. Afraid is a better 
word. 
</P>
<P>
"I was scared," he said. "Here's a man, Bruce McNall, who had enough confidence 
in me to make me an offer like that. I was afraid I would not live up to his 
expectations." 
</P>
<P>
It's a fear Robinson lives with every day. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Robinson didn't start as a defenseman. And if the weather in Ottawa had 
been a little bit better, he might never have become one. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson was a center when he played junior hockey while living on his parents' 
Ottawa farm. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a bad snowstorm, Robinson missed one game. He wound up, instead, 
sitting with Dan Dexter, who had another junior team. Dexter, down to three 
defensemen, figured Robinson, then a strapping 17-year-old, might be just what 
he needed. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson was interested. The result: junior hockey lost a center and the NHL 
gained one of its all-time defensemen. 
</P>
<P>
The transition was difficult at first. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone likes to be part of the glory," Robinson said. "But I got to the 
point where I get more satisfaction out of setting up a pass." 
</P>
<P>
There was still plenty of glory for him, as well. 
</P>
<P>
After starting his professional career with Kitchener of the old Ottawa Hockey 
Assn. in 1970, Robinson joined the Canadiens in the 1972-73 season. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the 6-foot-4, 225-pounder played on six Stanley Cup champions, was 
twice named winner of the James Norris Trophy, awarded to the league's best 
defenseman; and, in 1978, won the Conn Smythe Trophy, given to the playoff MVP. 
</P>
<P>
In 59 games this season, he has 38 points, giving him a lifetime total of 921, 
second best in NHL history among defensemen, behind only Denis Potvin. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of last season, however, Robinson knew it was time to move on. 
</P>
<P>
"They were going with a lot of young kids," he said of the Canadiens. "I didn't 
want to stick around as a baby-sitter. I hate watching. I'm not a good fan." 
</P>
<P>
He knew it would be different with the Kings, but he hadn't realized how much. 
</P>
<P>
"Over there," Robinson said, speaking of the Adams Division, "it was more of a 
one-on-one game. Dump and chase. You go bang in the corner and whoever comes up 
with the puck gets going. Here, it's much quicker, more controlled. There are 
guys coming at you from all directions." 
</P>
<P>
Too many for Robinson, lately. 
</P>
<P>
He's been on a bad streak, giving up the puck for six opposing goals in his 
last four games. Against the Detroit Red Wings on the last Kings' trip, 
Robinson's turnover allowed Steve Yzerman to score the game-winning goal with 
37 seconds to play. Against the Vancouver Canucks last week, the final two 
goals in a 6-4 loss were the direct result of Robinson giveaways. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a nightmare for Robinson, one that has kept him tossing and turning 
well into the night, replaying the crucial moments over and over again in the 
VCR of his mind. 
</P>
<P>
He has changed sticks. He has even changed suits, trying to change his luck. 
</P>
<P>
But, as the turnovers keep coming, Robinson has thoughts he never would have 
dreamed of in his prime. He finds himself hoping he doesn't even get the puck. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't wait to get off the ice," he admitted, "so I don't get scored on. I 
have started to doubt my abilities. I squeeze my stick harder. It sometimes 
seems like we don't have any other black shirts out there other than mine -- 
like the other side has 15 guys. 
</P>
<P>
"I think maybe it's because I'm not in shape, so I work out. I think my shot is 
off, so I pound the puck in practice until my arms are sore." 
</P>
<P>
Could he be simply too old? Has he lost a step? Or reaction time? 
</P>
<P>
"I can't always do things I once did," Robinson said. "But I think I can still 
keep up. If I couldn't, I'd quit. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the problems is the new team. You play seven, eight years with the same 
people. When you make a move, you expect a guy to be there because you know him 
so well. Now, the guy is not always there." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson doesn't see retirement in his immediate future. 
</P>
<P>
"I made the decision to play," he said, "and I'm very happy with it. I'm going 
to take it just one year at a time." 
</P>
<P>
When he does finally call it quits, Robinson, close to buying a home in Hidden 
Hills, wants to devote himself to horses, his next love after hockey. He owns 
six horses in Canada, is an avid polo player and has a share in a race horse 
with McNall, a horse named fittingly, it would seem, Down Again. 
</P>
<P>
McNall is far from down on Robinson's play. 
</P>
<P>
"Larry, in a way, has tried to do almost too much," McNall said. "A defensive 
guy is someone people see most when he makes a mistake. And being so well 
known, Larry draws a lot of attention that others do not. Larry Robinson is a 
big name and he's received some undue criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"But he handles it great. He'll say, 'Yeah, I blew that one.' It's kind of 
refreshing. He's so open and honest, it's a nice breath of fresh air. But I 
think he's too hard on himself." 
</P>
<P>
So no regrets about signing Robinson? 
</P>
<P>
"Not at all," McNall said. "We needed significant help with our defense, and 
he's been helpful to everyone. Given the chance to sign him, I would do it 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson's coach, Tom Webster, is also firmly in his corner. 
</P>
<P>
"Hockey players generally are their own worst critics," said Webster. "You 
don't have to say much to Larry. You've just got to lend support. 
</P>
<P>
"He bears too much of the burden on his own shoulders. It's like a running back 
in football. You look for the fumbles and, eventually, he's going to have them. 
Same thing with turnovers in hockey. But, overall, I think he has played well." 
</P>
<P>
Along with the personal adjustments, Robinson has also had to learn to play 
with a team that emphasizes offense over defense to a degree unheard of with 
the Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
"I was warned before I got here," Robinson said. "In Montreal, if we had three 
or four two-on-ones or three-on-twos in a game, it would be bad. With this 
team, we get that many in the first five minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Had the Kings enjoyed more success this season, his own problems would be more 
palatable. 
</P>
<P>
"We just haven't found ourselves yet as a team," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson's hope for salvation is that such a discovery will occur in the 
playoffs, assuming the Kings hold on to get there. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the good thing about hockey," he said. "There's always tomorrow. But 
we're running out of tomorrows." 
</P>
<P>
And nobody more so than Larry Robinson.

OIL SPILL IS STAR VEHICLE FOR MAYOR; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: HUNTINGTON BEACH'S THOMAS J. MAYS IS HAILED AS A RISING GOP PROSPECT 
AFTER HE EFFICIENTLY 'TOOK CARE OF BUSINESS' DURING THE CITY'S SHORELINE 
CRISIS.

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The boyish-looking mayor was blushing. 
</P>
<P>
Only 13 days before, lanky and soft-spoken Thomas J. Mays was in the third 
month of his one-year term, serving in a largely ceremonial and sometimes 
obscure post. But a week ago Tuesday, an overflow audience in the City Council 
chambers was on its feet delivering thunderous applause in honor of Mays' 
leadership since the Feb. 7 oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
"He took care of business and avoided some of the political grandstanding that 
some other state and federal politicians embarked on after the oil spill," said 
Councilman John Erskine, who led the applause. "I think he's shown a tremendous 
growth and maturity." 
</P>
<P>
Ever since the giant tanker American Trader gashed its hull on its own anchor 
and spilled 394,000 gallons of its oily cargo into the waters off Huntington 
Beach, Mays has gone from being just another local politician to being a 
frequent face on the network news. And Mays, a Republican, is now talking of 
riding the crest of his new-found prominence to a seat in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The tribute in the council chambers was only another sign that the 36-year-old 
rookie mayor of Huntington Beach has become -- practically overnight -- a 
rising personality in Orange County politics. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that Tom is an undiscovered gem who has long worked in the trenches of 
the party," said Orange County Republican Party Chairman Thomas A. Fuentes. 
"But as fate may have it, the occurrence of an oil spill has afforded him, 
finally, a proper public exposure." 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, herself a former Huntington Beach mayor, 
said the spill "was Tom's first test" as a new mayor and that, in her judgment, 
"he demonstrated leadership." 
</P>
<P>
"His youthful looks have probably worked against him," she noted. "It's 
difficult to get credibility when one is so young-looking. So the oil spill 
incident was a situation for him to show that his actions belie his young 
looks." 
</P>
<P>
If the spill created a national forum for the many politicians who raced onto 
the city's beach to bask in the publicity, it was Mays who much of the time was 
on center stage. But unlike the out-of-towners -- one of whom brought his own 
podium and microphone to set up on the sand -- Mays was never accused of 
exploiting the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, when other politicians had long since moved on to fresher issues, 
Mays was again down on the beach, officially reopening stretches that had been 
closed to the public since the spill. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't get any better-looking waves than this," said the former surfer, now 
dressed in his customary dark suit, starched white shirt and red silk tie. 
</P>
<P>
During the past few weeks, television viewers sometimes woke up to Mays' image 
on the "Today Show" and "CBS This Morning," and he was quoted in the New York 
Times, the Chicago Tribune and dozens of other major newspapers from Alaska to 
Florida. Last Sunday, he taped a "Phil Donahue Show" that aired Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
He was often up before dawn, boarding a helicopter to fly over and assess the 
spill's damage. He held frequent strategy sessions with representatives of the 
Coast Guard and other agencies involved in cleaning up the oil that was lapping 
at the city's shore. 
</P>
<P>
Mays even made news when he criticized Gov. George Deukmejian's refusal to 
declare the spill a "disaster" that qualified for emergency state assistance. 
</P>
<P>
"If he took a tour down here and saw how bad it was," Mays said at the time, 
"he would change his mind. If you can call it an emergency by having two 
Medflies down here. . . . I think their priorities may be a little mixed up." 
</P>
<P>
By taking a jab at the state's ranking Republican, Mays caused some political 
observers to raise their eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
"He has spoken rather harshly . . . and that's a risky thing to do for someone 
who wants a career in politics," said Huntington Beach Mayor Pro Tem Peter M. 
Green. "I was very surprised that he was that outspoken." 
</P>
<P>
But Mays' handling of the spill was widely praised, even by members of the 
other party. Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, the top Democrat in state government, 
said he was "impressed with Mayor Mays' response and management of the crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Mays has already announced his intention to seek a second four-year term on the 
council in November's election. But during a recent interview, he also said he 
is considering a run for Congress if the 1990 Census justifies the formation of 
a new district in west Orange County, which is currently shared by Reps. C. 
Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) and Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita). 
</P>
<P>
Said veteran political consultant Harvey Englander: "If a new congressional 
seat is formed, then certainly (Mays) would be a formidable candidate. He has 
done a good job in Huntington Beach and he's well liked as mayor and he showed 
a pretty cool head in his handling of the oil spill." 
</P>

Political observers say the free publicity Mays has received from the spill 
should prove invaluable to him. Erskine notes that when supporters of the 
Measure M half-cent sales tax proposal conducted a survey last year to see 
which county politicians were best known to voters, Mays emerged as one of the 
least known. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be very surprised if a survey were done now and people couldn't name Tom 
more frequently this year than in 1988," Erskine said. 
</P>
<P>
And others say the time may be ripe for Mays to make a bid for higher office. 
</P>
<P>
"Now all those things come together: experience, a conservative Republican 
philosophy and the high energy of a very vital young public officeholder, (and) 
that makes him an attractive potential candidate," said county GOP Chairman 
Fuentes. 
</P>
<P>
Mays' small office on the fourth floor of Huntington Beach City Hall is bright, 
sunny and -- like the mayor -- neat and orderly. One recent morning, he sat 
flipping through a stack of early 1900s Huntington Beach newspapers, glancing 
at stories about the construction of the city's historic pier. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to read these old newspapers because they give me a sense of Huntington 
Beach's history," Mays said. "I majored in political science because so much of 
history is formed by politics and politicians." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Huntington Park, Mays spent his childhood in La Mirada, Manhattan Beach 
and finally Huntington Beach, where he grew up surfing like many California 
beach youngsters. He still owns a long board. "Actually, I've been wanting to 
get out there and surf again. But the days recently have been pretty long." 
</P>
<P>
Mays has a bachelor's degree from UCLA and a master's, also in political 
science, from the University of Chicago. After college, he considered a career 
in the Foreign Service, but a job offer from McDonnell Douglas brought him back 
to Huntington Beach in 1978. He is a systems analyst for the giant aviation and 
aerospace firm. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother, who lives in Huntington Harbour, introduced me to the local 
California Republican Assembly, and I became interested and got active in 
that," Mays explained. After he worked for the election of Assemblyman Nolan 
Frizzelle (R-Huntington Beach) in 1980, Frizzelle ended up appointing Mays as a 
field representative on his staff. 
</P>
<P>
He made his first bid for elective office in 1984, when he ran for a Huntington 
Beach council seat. When he came within 1,000 votes of winning, Mays said, 
"people realized I had a chance. I kept my organization going, and we started 
making plans for 1986." 
</P>
<P>
That year, Mays campaigned as a pro-development candidate and won. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach council chooses the city's mayor every year from among its 
own ranks. Erskine says the council came close to selecting Mays in 1988. But 
"at the time, some people were of the opinion that maybe he was a little young 
and didn't quite have the experience," Erskine said. 
</P>
<P>
Mays discounts that explanation and blames his failure to secure the post on 
politics. He said the support he had collected to be named mayor was eroded 
when he publicly criticized Supervisor Wieder for not paying enough attention 
to complaints from residents about some sewage problems. 
</P>
<P>
For her part, Wieder said last week that she has had only pleasant relations 
with Mays, adding, "I've not had the chance to work with him until he became 
mayor." 
</P>
<P>
Mays acknowledges that a few months ago he was thinking about making a bid for 
Wieder's supervisorial post. But Wieder said she has only heard rumors. 
</P>
<P>
"Rumors are rampant," she said, dismissing suggestions that she and Mays could 
be political rivals. "If that rumor were true, how could it be that I have his 
endorsement for reelection? I enjoy his support and the support of 95% of the 
elected officials in my district." 
</P>
<P>
In Huntington Beach, political factions often fall along a line separating 
those with development interests from those with environmental concerns. Mays 
has generally not been considered a member of the council's "slow-growth" wing, 
led by council members Green and Grace Winchell. But the mayor maintains that 
he has been evenhanded on issues that pit development against environment. 
</P>
<P>
Mays has voted in favor of measures to protect Huntington Beach's fragile 
wetlands and last week was part of a unanimous vote to join the city of Los 
Angeles in a lawsuit to ban malathion spraying in the battle against the 
Mediterranean fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
Some political observers say Mays' support for some environmental causes is 
part of a national trend among new Republican leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"During the Reagan years, you had a big increase in the Republican rolls, and 
many of those new voters were yuppies living in California's coastal areas," 
said political consultant Allen Hoffenbloom. "If you're a Republican living 
inland you don't wake up every morning worrying about offshore drilling and 
coastal preservation. But if you live in Manhattan Beach or Hermosa Beach or 
Monterey, you do." 
</P>
<P>
But Debbie Cook, chairwoman of Save Our Parks, a Huntington Beach environmental 
group, suspects that Mays' concern for the environment is fleeting. 
</P>
<P>
"He said it (the oil spill) opened his eyes to environmental issues, but I just 
don't believe it," she said. "I don't think he ever takes the environmental 
stance he should." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to Cook, environmentalist Loretta Wolfe, president of Huntington 
Beach Tomorrow, praised the mayor even though she has frequently disagreed with 
his previous pro-development stands. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of him and thought he did a good job," Wolfe said. "He was out there 
all the time, day and night, and to me it was showing that he was not 
abandoning the city to the state or the other people who were moving in," Wolfe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
While it remains to be seen whether Mays' recent burst of visibility will ever 
translate into votes, for now, Surf City seems to be buzzing about its mayor's 
political future. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago, Mays was the main speaker at a Rotary Club luncheon at the 
Huntington Beach Inn, and almost everyone in attendance wanted to hear him talk 
about the oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
"Today we're very fortunate to have the man of the hour with us," program 
chairman Steve Holden said as he introduced Mays. "I'm sure you've all seen him 
on television. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom is a young man who is going places," Holden continued. "Maybe next time we 
see Tom he'll be Congressman Mays or Sen. Mays."

INS REGIONAL HEAD DAVIDIAN USES LOW-KEY APPROACH IN CONTRAST TO EZELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Ben Davidian relishes the fact that he's visited just about every outpost under 
his jurisdiction as the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service's top 
official in the West. He remembers a visit he paid Christmas Eve on 
unsuspecting Border Patrol agents near Nogales, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
"Can we do something for you?" several uniformed agents asked Davidian, not 
recognizing him to be the INS Western regional commissioner. "Well," he 
replied, "I was hoping to do something for you." 
</P>
<P>
After a few more questions, the embarrassed agents figured out who Davidian 
was. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll say this," one agent later confided, "any man who wants to freeze his 
buns with us on the Mexican border on Christmas Eve is OK by me." 
</P>
<P>
The episode seems to say much about the 38-year-old Sacramento lawyer in the 
six months since he succeeded the controversial and colorful Harold Ezell as 
one of four regional INS commissioners in the United States. He enjoys meeting 
many of the immigration service's 5,500 employees in his sprawling region that 
encompasses California, Nevada, Arizona, Hawaii and the Pacific island of Guam. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, according to his critics, is that he isn't meeting the right kind 
of people. 
</P>
<P>
Davidian has been attacked -- both inside and outside the INS -- as being an 
"invisible commissioner" who is afraid to meet with adversaries in the 
immigration field who are interested in finding out his views on important 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
He also has been accused of being a weak leader and being afraid of making 
decisions that might anger superiors in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the criticism stems from Davidian's avowed intention to reverse Ezell's 
publicity-seeking posture and turn the spotlight back to the "hard-working, 
dedicated (INS) men and women in the field." For example, he makes no apology 
for the fact that he has not yet held a news conference to articulate his views 
or those of the INS. 
</P>
<P>
In doing so, critics believe Davidian's silence has helped undermine the morale 
of many INS bureaucrats and has given a subtle message to Southern California's 
large immigrant population that it can expect little help from him. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an invisible commissioner who has done little to reach out to immigrant 
communities," said Linda Mitchell, a top official with a coalition of immigrant 
rights groups in Los Angeles. "I mean, who knows who he is?" 
</P>
<P>
Ernest Gustafson, who retired last September as INS district director in Los 
Angeles, added: "My concern is that the silence out of the INS is very negative 
for the community. It could develop into a curtain blocking the INS from the 
communities it is trying to serve. 
</P>
<P>
"Six months have gone by and we don't know anything new about him or the INS." 
</P>
<P>
Davidian rejected the criticism, saying that controversy comes with the 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a job that is not going to make friends with everybody," Davidian said 
in an interview at INS regional headquarters in Laguna Niguel. "You cannot have 
a job that deals with enforcement as well as service and expect everybody to 
like what you do." 
</P>
<P>
Several problems have cropped up that critics say could have been avoided if 
Davidian were a more aggressive executive: 
</P>
<P>
* The post left vacant by Gustafson's retirement, considered by many to be the 
second most important agency job in the West, is not filled. Without a 
replacement at the top, INS staffers say morale has plummeted in the downtown 
Los Angeles office while Davidian and officials in Washington deliberate about 
who should be appointed. 
</P>
<P>
* Davidian's office is lax in persuading aliens to complete their amnesty 
applications under the latest phase of the landmark immigration reform law. To 
achieve legal residency, applicants must complete courses on U.S. history and 
English by November. To date, 70% of the 1 million applicants in the West have 
completed the second step, but critics say the percentage could be much higher 
if Davidian was personally involved. 
</P>
<P>
* Davidian's views on various immigration issues, such as political asylum and 
increased funding for the agency, are unknown. Davidian said he chooses not to 
talk publicly about his views, partly because that is the job of his boss, INS 
Commissioner Gene McNary in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
* Some Latino activists involved in immigration work accuse Davidian of 
refusing to meet with them. He rejects that charge, saying he has met in recent 
months with representatives from such well-known Latino organizations as the 
American GI Forum and the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC). 
</P>
<P>
But Arnold Torres, national political adviser for LULAC, said those contacts 
were unauthorized and not substantive. "Since August, we have repeatedly sought 
meetings with him but he has officially closed the door after our opposition to 
the confirmation of McNary as INS commissioner." 
</P>
<P>
Such criticism does not seem to faze Davidian, a man of reserved demeanor who 
chaired the California Agriculture Labor Relations Board for 2 1/2 years as an 
appointee of Republican Gov. George Deukmejian before assuming the INS post 
Aug. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Davidian said he has worked hard to forge links with some Asian, Latino and 
other ethnic groups, adding that he's willing to meet with members of 
"responsible groups" when his schedule permits it. 
</P>
<P>
To the criticism that he has been slow in appointing a Los Angeles district 
director to replace Gustafson, Davidian said he takes "full responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to fill that job," he said. But he said McNary, who must have a hand 
in the selection, is still relatively new to his post and has other items to 
deal with first. 
</P>
<P>
"It's such an important job that I think we'll be very slow, very 
deliberative," Davidian said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Davidian's strongest supporters are those who work with him at the INS 
Laguna Niguel headquarters. They give him top marks in his first six months. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very popular with the people who work with him," said career INS official 
William King, who is in charge of the amnesty effort in the West. "He's very 
bright, very energetic. He's playing it low-key until he learns his job 
properly." 
</P>
<P>
Even Ezell, whose publicity stunts and outrageous statements sometimes got him 
into hot water with higher-ups during his six-year tenure as INS Western 
regional commissioner, has kudos for Davidian. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard nothing but good things about him from guys close in (who work with 
Davidian)," Ezell said. "And they ought to know." 
</P>
<P>
Officials within the Justice Department, which oversees the INS, say Davidian's 
demeanor is a marked improvement over Ezell's flamboyant, controversial style. 
Ezell came under fire for threatening to cut off federal funds to cities that 
supported the sanctuary movement for Central American refugees and once 
embarrassed the agency by attending a party thrown by Ferdinand and Imelda 
Marcos at a time when they were under investigation by the Justice Department 
for allegedly stealing tens of millions of dollars from the Philippines 
treasury. 
</P>
<P>
Davidian, who favors pinstripe suits and button-down collars, would never be 
mistaken for Ezell, who repeatedly donned a Mexican sombrero to publicize 
amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
"Davidian's not running around with sombreros on, talking all kinds of stuff 
that was not cleared with anybody in Washington," said one Justice Department 
official, who asked not to be identified. "He's competent, steady and working 
hard." 
</P>
<P>
But there are others inside the INS Western region who accuse Davidian of being 
a "wimp" who is afraid of offending his superiors. The criticism is so stinging 
that they asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a joke, a political hack," said one INS middle-manager. "We ought to have 
INS professionals running the show." 
</P>
<P>
Said another mid-level official inside the agency: "His office has copies of 
correspondence stacked from the floor to the ceiling waiting for his signature 
for several weeks because he is afraid of making a decision. He hasn't filled 
the L.A. job yet. He manages like a puppet by only reacting when Washington 
tells him how and when to take action. 
</P>
<P>
"Ezell was overzealous but Davidian is the invisible wimp behind his closed 
office door." 
</P>
<P>
Davidian said his door is always open and does not understand the criticism by 
those under him. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to say I have an open-door policy and I can't meet with everybody who 
wants to meet with me," he said. "I've never had . . . somebody walk up to me 
and tell me we have a morale problem that has anything to do with what I'm 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
Davidian's reluctance to speak out publicly is tied to a restrictive policy 
imposed on the INS by McNary, who followed the lead of his boss, Atty. Gen. 
Dick Thornburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, Thornburgh started a campaign within the Justice Department 
against unauthorized leaks to reporters. McNary then issued a directive 
requiring that all news media inquiries, unless they are of the most routine 
nature, be cleared with INS headquarters in Washington. It requires 
Washington's approval before any INS official, including ranking ones like 
Davidian, can speak officially with a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
But in the months since the policy began, overly cautious immigration officials 
at every level have checked with Washington before releasing any information. 
Recently, when one official at the Laguna Niguel regional headquarters was 
asked for his title, he replied that he would have to get clearance from 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The official never called back. 
</P>
<P>
Davidian refuses to be drawn into a debate on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
But Ezell, who was never shy about voicing his opinions, said he opposes the 
new policy. 
</P>
<P>
"The attorney general can be the one spokesman for the Justice Department and 
that's his decision," Ezell said. "But it's a lousy one. He's not omnipresent. 
You have a department with qualified appointees who are commissioners. That's 
what you got them there for. The attorney general's 3,000 miles away from the 
action." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Ezell said, the aggressive public posture the agency took during 
the Reagan Administration is "going down the tubes." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of reacting to the criticism, Davidian is content to go out and meet 
the troops and face the challenges of his job, even if he lacks Ezell's 
showmanship. 
</P>
<P>
One of those challenges is the agency's growing role in the interdiction of 
illegal drugs smuggled across the U.S.-Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
The INS role in the drug war comes at a time when Bush Administration officials 
admit there are dwindling funds for an already overworked immigration service. 
</P>
<P>
Davidian said he was surprised when he learned how much drugs his Border Patrol 
agents are seizing while apprehending illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
"One day, a coyote (alien smuggler) may be bringing over undocumented aliens. 
The next day, he or she may be bringing over marijuana. The next day, it may be 
cocaine and the next day, it may be undocumented aliens again," Davidian said. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't go looking for the war on drugs. It came to us."
