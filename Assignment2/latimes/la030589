DANCING AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD BY URSULA K. LE GUIN (GROVE PRESS: $17.95; 320

and Space, will be published by Harper &amp; Row in the spring.

<TEXT>
<P>
All writers want to preserve the words they've labored hour upon hour to 
squeeze out onto the page -- even, or perhaps especially, the ones composed for 
specific occasions, ephemeral words, which threaten to dissolve in the May 
sunshine gracing a college commencement or fade along with the snapshots of a 
cross-country journey or vanish with the magazine gone belly-up after two 
promising issues. I'm not sure all writers will admit to such an urge, but I'm 
convinced we all feel it. 
</P>
<P>
Out of it arises a work like Ursula K. Le Guin's "Dancing at the Edge of the 
World," which draws together between durable covers miscellaneous essays, 
travel journals, commencement addresses, lectures, informal talks, and reviews 
spanning 12 years. The product is not a thematically or rhetorically coherent 
text, not a "book" in that sense at all. Really, it's more of a jumble. 
</P>
<P>
But then . . . what's wrong with that? This is what the British call a jumble 
sale, the chancy source of some of life's treasures: the cracked mug on which a 
woman, diaphanously clad, rides a butterfly-drawn chariot under the title 
ECSTASY; five out of six tulip-shaped wine glasses; or, for 10 cents, Sammy 
Snake, 6 feet of chartreuse plush, who will spend a decade entwined in the 
bedclothes of one child or another. 
</P>
<P>
"Dancing at the Edge of the World" holds this sort of plenty, unpredictable and 
uneven but, for those very reasons, a trove of delights: insightful, 
impassioned, sometimes lyrical, often funny. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how various its components, a compilation like this one must shove 
them into some sort of linear order. Le Guin has chosen, to good effect, a 
chronological arrangement rather than some more subtle logical principle. This 
system, in its plainness, doesn't draw attention to itself. And it does, as she 
points out in the introduction, "provide a sort of mental biography, a record 
of responses to ethical and political climates, of the transforming effect of 
certain literary ideas, and of the changes of a mind." In one instance, "Is 
Gender Necessary? Redux," she makes the matter of writerly development explicit 
by printing her reconsiderations after a decade in the margins of the original 
text. 
</P>
<P>
The only exception to the book's straight chronological order is the collection 
in a separate section of 17 reviews, also arranged chronologically, at the end. 
This position is unfortunate, since it makes the reviews seem tacked on and 
prevents the book from ending on its strongest note, "The Fisherwoman's 
Daughter," a persuasive critique of the "books-or-babies myth" promulgated by 
misogynists and feminists alike. 
</P>
<P>
But the reviews, of subjects as various as "Star Wars," the "maverick genius" 
of Mervyn Peake, and May Sarton's poetry, reveal pleasurable insights into Le 
Guin's literary and cinematic tastes. "How many novelists are there writing 
now," she asks in a review of Doris Lessing's "The Sentimental Agents," "who 
can make you really angry?" It's as good a criterion for choosing to read a 
book by Lessing as I've seen. I wouldn't have wanted to miss these reviews, and 
I couldn't have figured out a better place to stick them, either. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, however, she is at her best in the pieces that offer more 
scope for invention and reflection. Using increasingly sophisticated, though 
never pretentious, feminist theoretical insights, she virtually revises the 
world, that is, sees it anew, in terms that subvert "Euclidean, European, or 
masculinist" values that have led to social injustices and the threat of global 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
Less skilled writers have wrought out of these themes some pretty heavy-handed 
and flatfooted polemics. But Le Guin's prose, true to the title of this 
collection, dances. Here she is, for instance, illustrating for Bryn Mawr's 
graduates their "mother tongue" as differentiated from "the language of the 
fathers": 
</P>
<P>
"John have you got your umbrella I think it's going to rain. Can you come play 
with me? If I told you once I told you a hundred times. Things here just aren't 
the same without Mother, I will now sign your affectionate brother James. Oh 
what am I going to do? So I said to her I said if he thinks she's going to 
stand for that but then there's his arthritis poor thing and no work. I love 
you. I hate you. I hate liver. Joan dear did you feed the sheep, don't just 
stand around mooning. Tell me what they said, tell me what you did. Oh now my 
feet do hurt. My heart is breaking. Touch me here, touch me again." 
</P>
<P>
The whole jumble of human experience heaped up in these few lovingly chosen 
phrases. 
</P>
<P>
Those who appreciate Le Guin's novels will find the pieces in "Dancing at the 
Edge of the World" no substitute for their intricacies of vision and language. 
But this volume makes a fine companion, and on occasion a guide, to her 
fiction, offering insight into the writer at work. She differs, for instance, 
from the Hero, who "has decreed through his mouthpieces the Lawgivers, first, 
that the proper shape of the narrative is that of the arrow or spear, starting 
here and going straight there and THOK! hitting its mark (which drops dead); 
second, that the central concern of the narrative, including the novel, is 
conflict; and third, that the story isn't any good if he isn't in it." Her 
narrative model is, rather, a "carrier bag/belly/box/house/medicine bundle." 
Like these containers, "Dancing at the Edge of the World" is full to bursting.

<TEXT>
<P>
Day One (CBS Sunday at 8 p.m.), a new three-hour TV movie written and directed 
by David W. Rintels, stars Brian Dennehy, David Strathairn and Michael Tucker 
in the story of the Manhattan Project and the race to develop the atomic bomb. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Mann's ferocious, mesmerizing 1986 movie Manhunter (NBC Sunday at 9 
p.m.) is a dark locomotive of a movie, dragging the audience with it. It's a 
sleek, hard-edged psychological detective story in which its most lingering 
characters are its twin sadistic killers. William L. Petersen stars as a 
troubled ex-FBI agent called back to service to track down a serial murderer. 
Strong, exciting -- and not for children. 
</P>
<P>
Robin Givens stars in the new TV movie The Penthouse (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) as 
the daughter of a music mogul held hostage in her own apartment. 
</P>
<P>
The Assisi Underground (Channel 5 Monday at 8 p.m.) is a standard 1985 drama 
about an attempt on the part of the Catholic Church to save Italian Jews from 
the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
A better bet is the original 1967 In the Heat of the Night (Channel 13 Monday 
at 8 p.m.), starring Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger. 
</P>
<P>
Those She Left Behind (NBC Monday at 9 p.m.) is a new TV movie starring Gary 
Cole as a businessman struggling to rebuild his life and care for his newborn 
baby after his wife's death. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1981 First Monday in October (Channel 13 Tuesday at 8 p.m.), Walter 
Matthau is terrific as a seasoned justice of the Supreme Court in the William 
O. Douglas mold. Unfortunately, the film -- which betrays its theatrical roots 
as the liberal Matthau duels with the newly appointed conservative, Jill 
Clayburgh -- really doesn't get anywhere, for all the issues dramatists Jerome 
Lawrence and Robert E. Lee raise. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 TV movie Intrigue (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.) is an efficient enough genre 
film, given some grit by Robert Loggia as an American defector who wants to 
return home; Scott Glenn is his former protege whom the CIA sends undercover to 
retrieve him. 
</P>
<P>
Night of the Creeps (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m., again on Saturday at 8 
p.m.) is a 1986 first feature from writer-director Fred Dekker, who has fun 
with horror picture cliches as a group of college students battle zombie 
ax-murderers. 
</P>
<P>
Hard Knox (Channel 11 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), a 1984 TV movie, serves up a so-so 
dose of sentimental machismo as Robert Conrad plays a career Marine Corps pilot 
who takes over the operation of a military school filled with young misfits 
when he is forced to retire from the service. 
</P>
<P>
The Car (Channel 5 Thursday at 8 p.m.) features a big, black monster of a 
driverless, impregnable automobile that literally decimates a small 
Southwestern desert community. James Brolin and Ronny Cox are the unfortunate 
humans in this grisly and hollow 1977 film. You're better off watching Billy 
Wilder's 36-year-old Stalag 17 (Channel 11 Thursday at 8 p.m.) with William 
Holden. 
</P>
<P>
The 1982 horror picture A Stranger Is Watching (Channel 5 Friday at 8 p.m.) has 
hopefully been toned down for TV. A morbid exercise in extreme violence against 
women (and men), it features a child witnessing her mother being hammered to 
death and a woman being stabbed to death with a screwdriver. Rip Torn and Kate 
Mulgrew star. 
</P>
<P>
A warm film of illuminating impact, The Chosen (Channel 11 Friday at 8 p.m.) 
tells a story of friendship, of love between fathers and sons, and above all, 
what it means to be Jewish. Director Jeremy Paul Kagan and adapter Edwin 
Gordon's 1981 film of the 1967 Chaim Potok novel stars Rod Steiger as a Hasidic 
rabbi and Robby Benson as his son. The film's central question is: How can a 
religion maintain its integrity and its traditions and still keep in touch with 
the times? Maximilian Schell and Barry Miller also star. 
</P>
<P>
The 1984 computer fantasy Electric Dreams (Channel 5 Saturday at 6 p.m.), a 
romantic comedy of genuine sweetness and originality, stars Lenny Von Dohlen as 
a spacey, klutzy young San Francisco architect whose computer (voice supplied 
by Bud Cort) plays Cupid.

RICHARD EDER: SIEGE PERILOUS IN THE COURT OF DUTCH SCHULTZ; 
</P>
<P>
BILLY BATHGATE BY E. L. DOCTOROW (RANDOM HOUSE: $19.95; 320 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aking is known by the tone of his retinue. E. L. Doctorow elevates the story of 
the gangster, Dutch Schultz, into a cycle of rise, fall and renewal by using 
the lofty voice of a prodigious 15-year-old apprentice-boy. 
</P>
<P>
Like virtually all of Doctorow's work, "Billy Bathgate" uses some of the 
features of a period piece to do something quite different. Here, the period is 
the 1930s, when Schultz flourished in his own ferocious fashion until state 
prosecutors -- notably, the late Thomas E. Dewey -- began pressing him hard, 
and a rival gang rubbed him out. 
</P>
<P>
Doctorow's novel makes full and loving use of the manners, the artifacts, the 
savors and the rhythms of the '30s. He is marvelously skillful at getting into 
the thoughts and the lingo of the time. 
</P>
<P>
But that is not all. There is also a contemporary sensibility at work at some 
mid-point between the author and his narrator. The Billy Bathgate of the title, 
the 1930s apprentice, recalls his story today, in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
It is, as "Ragtime," "Loon Lake," "World's Fair" were, a dialogue between two 
eras. And Doctorow's ultimate purpose, aside from entertaining and enthralling 
-- which perhaps he has never done so well as here -- is only apparently to 
re-create the past through this dialogue. In fact, it is to give an edge, an 
unsettling undertone to the present. 
</P>
<P>
Billy is an apocryphal figure amid a lot of real, or only partly embroidered 
New York history. The Schultz that Billy remembers -- his idol, his mentor and, 
in the way symbolic fathers are, his victim -- is both real and transfigured. 
It is the difference between a 6th-Century Welsh chieftain and the 
myth-enshrouded King Arthur of Thomas Malory. 
</P>
<P>
The Arthurian comparison goes further. Billy is a Bronx slum-kid who catches 
Shultz's eye. He is a protege but in a distant, mysterious fashion. Like some 
Arthurian Round-Tabler, he is sent on a quest, marked by lethal puzzles and 
ordeals. In this case, the object is not the Grail, but a seat at the 
gangster-king's right hand. 
</P>
<P>
Billy becomes an errand boy at numbers-racket headquarters. As an initiation, 
he is taken to watch the arranged death -- by apparent mishap -- of a 
troublesome window washer in a union that Shultz controls. 
</P>
<P>
Billy is tutored in detail by Schultz's accountant, Abbadabba Berman, a cripple 
and a mathematical genius. Schultz himself is alternately remote and close, 
benevolent and threatening. Billy never knows when he is in favor and when he 
may be liquidated. 
</P>
<P>
It is the truest apprenticeship. Schultz's own life of perpetual combat and 
deadly gambles is mirrored in Billy's uncertainty about his position, and even 
his life. 
</P>
<P>
He becomes a busboy-cum-informer in a Schultz-controlled bar. He witnesses 
Schultz's personal liquidation of a lieutenant suspected of treachery. He is a 
kind of chaperon and companion to the gangster's high-society mistress, and 
briefly -- though he is only 15 -- her lover. 
</P>
<P>
Still 15, and still wearing short pants, he is assigned to shadow Dewey. 
Schultz, unhinged by the net closing about his operations, wants to kill the 
prosecutor. And Billy is there, in a New Jersey restaurant, when the Mafia 
chieftain, Lucky Luciano -- fearful that such a scheme will ruin them all -- 
has his men kill Schultz and his lieutenants. 
</P>
<P>
Billy tells the story in a series of scenes, and what vividly cinematic scenes 
they are! He begins on a tugboat chugging off New York Harbor late at night. 
Schultz has kidnaped his lieutenant, Bo Weinberg, suspecting him of dealing 
with his rivals. 
</P>
<P>
We see Bo, tied to a chair and having his pants legs rolled up by Irving, 
Schultz's meticulous assistant. Here, for a specimen of the book's brilliantly 
precise language, is Billy's description of this quiet technician: 
</P>
<P>
"He was a professional, but since he had no profession other than dealing with 
contingencies of his chosen life, he carried himself as if life was a 
profession just as, I suppose in a more conventional employment, a butler 
would." 
</P>
<P>
Pants rolled up, feet white and naked, Bo is about to take Irving's arm and be 
helped into a tub of wet concrete. When it hardens, Schultz will come up -- he 
has taken Bo's girlfriend to a cabin below -- and kick Bo overboard. 
</P>
<P>
Shod in concrete, his tuxedo rumpled, Bo remains elegant nonetheless. Schultz, 
on the other hand, is awkward and ill-clad despite the expensive clothes he 
keeps tugging at. "He tried constantly," Billy tells us, "to correct his 
relation to his clothing." 
</P>
<P>
Other scenes are related with a similar mix of rich detail, irony, tension, and 
a nervy, darting reflectiveness that keeps taking us in unexpected directions. 
</P>
<P>
There is Billy's first encounter with Schultz -- he is juggling bottles on the 
sidewalk -- and his hilarious stratagem for getting taken on as a messenger 
boy. There is a whole pastoral-comic sequence in an Upstate New York town where 
Schultz and his henchmen settle down for a few months. Their task is to spend 
money and play the role of good citizens -- Billy has to go to Sunday School -- 
so as to impress the local jury empaneled to try them. 
</P>
<P>
Billy's voice is by turns flowery, baroque, mystical and down-to-earth. It is 
mannered talk, yet supple enough to accommodate both the questing 15-year-old, 
as recalled by his older self; and Doctorow's own vision. 
</P>
<P>
After Schultz is gunned down in the New Jersey bar, Billy slips away, 
unnoticed. He has the combination to his master's safe, and clues to where the 
rest of his fortune is stashed. Later, he tells us, he will use the money to 
build up his own empire. 
</P>
<P>
He does not tell us who he has become, nor whether he is still connected to the 
gangs. It does not matter, he implies. Gangs and "legitimate" enterprises come 
and go; the money is unchanging and immortal. 
</P>
<P>
So much for the dark thread that runs -- as it did in "Ragtime" -- through a 
gaudy and elegant book. It is a binding thread, a governing one. 
</P>
<P>
And there, perhaps, is the underlying weakness of "Billy" despite its 
beguilement. As in his other recent books, Doctorow governs his work as a 
craftsman governs his material. The pulse and pattern his characters move to 
seem implanted; he has given them a life-like mechanism, not life itself. 
</P>
<P>
At his best, that is, his novels are prodigious toys. When they end -- even his 
placement in a past time makes their endings seem like an off-switch -- the 
thread is in his hand. The toy goes back to him. We open our eyes just where we 
have closed them. Like Bo Weinberg, though infinitely more agreeably, we have 
been not on a journey but a ride.

<P>
MORAL AND SENSUAL ATTRACTIONS IN DOING EVIL BY JACK KATZ (BASIC BOOKS: $19.95; 
384 PP.; 0-465-07615-7) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert H. Frank, Frank, an economics professor at Cornell University, is the 
author of Passions Within Reason: The Strategic Role of the Emotions (W. W. 
Norton). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Allen, a career stickup man from a black ghetto in Washington had this to 
say about why he chose stickup over safer, more lucrative forms of crime: 
</P>
<P>
"For a man, pimping is a good way of making money, but the fastest way is 
narcotics, and the safest and best way of all is numbers. Even though my whores 
were making a lot of money, I just didn't like pimping that much. It ain't my 
style. . . . I missed stickup quite a bit. . . . What I really missed was the 
excitement of sticking up and the planning and the getting away with it. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
In "Seductions of Crime," UCLA sociologist Jack Katz challenges the 
conventional view that criminals approach their crimes "in the calculating 
spirit of making money." Cost-benefit analysis certainly does not seem to have 
been the driving force for Allen. By the time he was 34, he had spent more than 
14 years behind bars and was crippled for life from a police shooting. Yet he 
persisted, committing at least one robbery even after confinement to his 
wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
Allen's experience is by no means unusual. Burglaries and robberies yield an 
average take of only about $80. A relatively small number of repeat offenders 
account for most of these crimes and almost all of them spend much of their 
lives in jail. Where these career offenders are concerned, there is 
considerable support for the maxim that crime doesn't pay. 
</P>
<P>
The spending patterns of criminals lend additional testimony that material 
deprivation is not their primary motive. After a big score, a buying spree 
usually follows, only not the sort of buying we usually associate with poverty: 
"I get lots of things I don't need. . . . When I've got money, I don't sleep 
for three or four days -- you're just buying something all the time." Often, 
much of the take is spent on others or simply given away. "The money ain't 
nothing. You just use the money to make your play. To show people you are the 
best." 
</P>
<P>
Katz's claim is that criminals seek not material rewards but the sensual 
experience of the crime itself. The adolescent shoplifter, for example, savors 
not the trinket she steals but the challenge of sneaking it past the clerk, the 
thrill of having outsmarted the system. With stickup men, as with members of 
adolescent street gangs, it is the transcendent joy of dominating an adversary. 
With the impassioned killer, it is to vent the rage triggered by humiliation or 
by a threat to some cherished moral value. 
</P>
<P>
Katz argues for his claim by a patient and careful review of previously 
published ethnographic accounts of deviance. His method is to reconstruct the 
criminal's experience in the moments leading up to the crime, and in this he is 
remarkably successful. He takes us inside the criminal's head, where many 
readers will feel alarmed to discover that seemingly senseless crimes sometimes 
do indeed exert a strong sensual attraction. 
</P>
<P>
Now, to say that crime is motivated by sensual attraction is not to say that it 
never makes sense from a materialist perspective, and Katz acknowledges that 
deviance often does serve practical purposes. He points out, for example, that 
the celebrity status of the "badass" assures a reliable source of sexual 
favors. There is also the irony that the ability to intimidate, which commands 
a variety of obvious material advantages, is most easily achieved by someone 
believed to be irrational. (Harvard's Tom Schelling once observed that if a 
person knocked at your door and threatened to pull the pin on a hand grenade 
unless you gave him $10, you'd be much more likely to comply if his eyes were 
bloodshot.) 
</P>
<P>
In stressing that emotional factors explain criminal behavior, Katz does not 
deny the patterns in the traditional background factors emphasized by social 
scientists. He notes, for instance, that robberies are overwhelmingly more 
likely to be committed by black males, and explains how factors in the ghetto 
experience predispose these men to be seduced by the opportunity to dominate in 
a stickup. In the same vein, he explains why the experience of impoverished 
immigrant youths in America makes them ripe candidates for the seductions of 
membership in elite street gangs. 
</P>
<P>
What remains unclear is why Katz believes that these background factors are not 
really causes of crime: 
</P>
<P>
". . . The longstanding association in the United States of street elites with 
urban ethnic-minority adolescent poverty groups is causally spurious. None of 
these conditions, alone or in combination, is necessary for the social 
construction of the phenomenon. What is essential is the existence, in the 
generational background, of a culture humbled at the prospect of entering 
modern, rationalized society." 
</P>
<P>
What does Katz mean here? Surely membership in a humbled culture is neither 
more nor less necessary (or sufficient) to explain crime than is membership in 
an urban, ethnic-minority poverty group. Indeed, the two categories are very 
much the same. The conventional view is that membership in these categories 
makes people more likely to engage in deviant behavior. The conventional view 
goes on to assume that this deviance is undertaken for the primary purpose of 
acquiring additional material possessions. Katz gives us ample basis for 
questioning the latter assumption. But his analysis provides no grounds 
whatever for concluding that the traditional background factors do not cause 
people to commit crimes. 
</P>
<P>
For policy reasons, this point is important. After all, as potential victims of 
violent crime, our most pressing concern is what can be done to prevent it. The 
conventional wisdom is that programs that reduce social and economic inequality 
serve this purpose. Katz seems to disavow this view, saying that readers "who 
follow (his) argument to its end may not find encouragement for broad-based 
social welfare policies. . . ." Yet it simply does not follow from his analysis 
that crime rates will be unaffected by reductions in inequality. And from the 
victim's point of view, it does not matter whether social programs curtail 
crime by making it less seductive or by reducing the need for material goods. 
</P>
<P>
But this is a quibble. "Seductions of Crime" is an important and original book. 
It is not an easy read, but serious students of crime cannot afford to ignore 
it.

I want to thank the creators and writers of "The Wonder Years" for producing 
the most brilliant comedy series since "Taxi." I am 33 years old and grew up in 
western Pennsylvania, where I was Kevin Arnold's age in the '60s. It seems as 
though that series was made about my life. We said and did everything they do 
in the show. "Wonder Years" is a comedy filled with sad moments, dramatic 
moments and hilarious moments -- not just a stream of silly punch lines. Thanks 
for the careful thought, research and quality that goes into such a wonderful 
series.

I watch old reruns of "I Love Lucy," "Sanford and Son" and "The Honeymooners" 
and they still make me laugh. The other night I watched "Roseanne" for the 
first time and I didn't laugh once during the whole show. Have I lost my sense 
of humor? Should I go see a psychiatrist?

Brownstein's article suggests incorrectly that America has something to learn 
from Los Angeles as a city. The truth is that America has nothing new to learn 
from L.A. except how not to create a city. The best things about it -- the 
climate and natural surroundings -- have only been damaged by our additions to 
them, through smog, and, now, the pollution of Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
I believe our civic leaders should adopt an official mascot. I propose the 
capybara, a large rodent about the size of a cocker spaniel. It barks and is 
cheerful and cute. I saw one at the L.A. Zoo, drinking from its water dish, in 
which it was also standing. It also was urinating into the same water. I 
thought of this while parked in traffic on the 405 Freeway near Santa Monica 
Boulevard staring at a soon-to-be completed office complex with 7,000 new 
parking spaces.

WOMEN'S SPRING FASHION; 
</P>
<P>
CLASSIC VALUES; 
</P>
<P>
THREE FLAMBOYANT REDHEADS MODEL THE SEASON'S CONSERVATIVE STYLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
DESIGNERS SHOWED EVERYTHING from pants as wide as pyramids to gold lame 
sportswear at the spring fashion previews, but what will most women actually 
wear? Clearly, the trend is toward conservative styles. 
</P>
<P>
Buyers call it a season of "retail reality." Classic clothes in feminine, not 
man-tailored, shapes are filling stores. But there are a few surprises: 
jumpsuits for evening and weekend wear, pantsuits (that some women will wear to 
work) and ankle-length dresses and skirts, some as full as sails in the wind. 
</P>
<P>
If a working woman makes one major purchase this spring, it is likely to be 
practical: "A suit, in a softer fabric, especially silk or rayon," predicts 
Wesley Clay, Robinson's vice president of merchandising. Interpretations of the 
Chanel suit -- with its cardigan jacket, engraved gold buttons and straight or 
pleated skirt -- are even more in demand than they were a year ago. Among 
smaller investments, white shirts and blouses are the first choice for updating 
black or navy skirts during this conservative season. Surprisingly, gold lame 
is back and will be worn interchangeably with white for evening or day. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest break with recent tradition is the return to pants. Experts 
don't agree, however, about whether women will wear them to work. "No," says 
LeeAnn Rosekelley, Nordstrom's fashion coordinator. "They're an alternative to 
skirts for weekends and evenings." "Yes," counters Rose Marie Bravo, the new 
chairman and chief executive officer of I. Magnin and Bullocks Wilshire: "We 
did buy pantsuits for women to wear to work, especially executive women." She 
names designer Donna Karan, a trend-setter in corporate style, who showed pants 
almost to the exclusion of skirts for spring. One consensus: The best shape is 
the easy-cut trouser, gently gathered or pleated at the waist, preferably with 
pockets and a slightly wider leg than most women are used to wearing. 
</P>
<P>
With so few new options in office wear, women will probably spend more on 
weekend and casual evening clothes this spring, says Marjorie Dean, president 
of the Tobe Report, a nationwide buying service for stores. The evening wear 
they choose will have fewer froufrous than in recent seasons. "Simple shapes, 
without a lot of decoration," says Los Angeles designer Kevan Hall, who adds 
that his strapless chiffon dress with long, graceful skirt is a best seller. I. 
Magnin / Bullocks Wilshire's Bravo sums up what apparently has been in the 
minds of many shoppers: "Fashion has calmed down. It was getting too extreme."

OUTTAKES: SOLITARY REFINEMENT

The London Sunday Telegraph has just paid a whopping $70,000 for first serial 
rights to "Jacqueline du Pre, A Biography," due out in hardcover in England in 
June. Du Pre was the world-renowned English cellist whose career was tragically 
cut short in 1973 by multiple sclerosis when she was 28; she died in 1987. 
Author Carol Easton told us she had Du Pre's cooperation on the book, but met 
with "a lot of opposition from her family, because they didn't want anyone 
getting behind the myth." 
</P>
<P>
The myth, Easton explained, "was that Jacqueline had this golden, fairy tale 
life, when in fact, she was isolated by her talent as a child, isolated in the 
concert world, and then by her illness." 
</P>
<P>
Easton will include material on Du Pre's husband, conductor-pianist Daniel 
Barenboim (fired recently from his $1.1-million job as director of the Opera de 
la Bastille in Paris, amidst much publicity, and recently named director of the 
Chicago Symphony Orchestra). As Du Pre deteriorated, Easton said, Barenboim 
moved alone to Paris, eventually becoming involved and having children with 
another woman (they married last year). 
</P>
<P>
Agent Michael Hamilburg said that about 20 publishers have expressed interest 
in U.S. book rights, which go up for bids in NYC later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, after waiting 13 years, William Morrow has finally issued the 
paperback version of Easton's critically praised "The Search for Sam Goldwyn." 
</P>
<P>
The timing, she suspects, has something to do with the April publication of 
Knopf's "Goldwyn: A Biography," by A. Scott Berg, which Publisher's Weekly 
recently reviewed as "a thoroughly engrossing book about an unadmirable man."

After months of speculation, the plum role of stripper Blaze Starr has been 
cast. 
</P>
<P>
Starring opposite Paul Newman -- who will play Louisiana Gov. Earl Long -- in 
A&amp;M/Touchstone's "Blaze," will be a virtual unknown. She's Lolita 
Davidovich, a Toronto-based actress of limited film experience. 
</P>
<P>
Davidovich snared the role after the film's producers read and tested hundreds 
of actresses -- known and unknown. (For awhile, it was widely talked that 
Melanie Griffith would portray the voluptuous Blaze.) 
</P>
<P>
Davidovich, until recently known professionally as Lolita David, has had small 
roles in Columbia's "Big Town" and Paramount's "A New Life." Her most 
significant film part to date: The third lead in a Canadian thriller called 
"Blindside," starring Harvey Keitel. 
</P>
<P>
"Blaze" chronicles the real-life tempestuous relationship between Starr, and 
the Louisiana politician, which began in 1959 and ended when he died the 
following year. Despite scandalous national headlines, Long rebuffed political 
pressure to end the affair. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Shelton wrote the script and will direct when "Blaze" begins filming next 
month in Baton Rouge under producers Gil Friesen and Dale Pollack. Leonard

Has "Wired" -- the controversial John Belushi screen bio -- finally found its 
domestic distributor? According to several sources, serious negotiations are 
under way with New Visions, the company headed by film maker Taylor Hackford 
("La Bamba"). And there are plans for a 700-print July release. 
</P>
<P>
This after the major studios passed on the $13.5-million project. 
</P>
<P>
The book on which it's based,Bob Woodward's 1984 best seller about the frantic 
rise -- and druggy 1982 death of the comic star -- was snubbed and reviled by 
many folks in Hollywood. (Most notably, those who knew/worked with Belushi.) 
When Feldman bought the rights, he didn't have a lot of competition. As he told 
The Times last June, when the movie was shooting, "No one wanted it." 
</P>
<P>
Now the film's odyssey has become a legend all its own. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no secret that the film's been everywhere," said producer Ed Feldman -- 
who wouldn't confirm a pending deal. ("On this movie, anything might happen.") 
</P>
<P>
He did say that screenings at the American Film Market, which wraps tomorrow, 
have so far generated foreign sales to England, Scandinavia, Australia, Hong 
Kong and Singapore. Pat H. Broeske

DOCTORS VENTURE INTO THE COSMETICS BUSINESS WITH IN-OFFICE SALES

TODAY MANY doctors have entered the cosmetics business, selling 
non-prescription skin-care products right in their offices. Like beauty 
advisers in department stores, dermatologists and plastic surgeons are now 
recommending lines of cleansers, astringents and moisturizers. Some physicians 
formulate their products, others add their labels to existing generics, and 
still others sell brand-name items designed specifically for sale in doctors' 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills dermatologist Letantia Bussell created her product line, Beverly 
Hills Proform, because "my patients always asked me what to use, and I didn't 
find any one line that addressed all their needs." Originally sold only in her 
office to patients with complexion problems, Proform is now sold in selected 
stores across the country and will soon be available in selected J. C. Penney 
stores in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
RejuvenAge, which was developed for use with the prescription drug Retin-A, is 
a brand-name line sold in a number of doctors' offices. The six-item collection 
was tested by dermatologist Albert Kligman, the professor at the University of 
Pennsylvania School of Medicine who invented Retin-A and first reported its 
anti-aging effects. The line features a facial cleanser, four moisturizers (two 
with a sun-protection factor of 6 and two with an SPF of 15) and a nighttime 
emollient. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Kotler, a Century City cosmetic surgeon, sells RejuvenAge to patients 
who use Retin-A as part of what he calls "a complete program to treat 
wrinkles." Kotler, a clinical instructor of surgery at the UCLA School of 
Medicine, says he chose to sell the line because Kligman's name is associated 
with it. "He's the dean of dermatology today, so his name is a very important 
credential to be attached to the product," Kotler explains. 
</P>
<P>
The question of medical ethics is bound to arise when doctors begin to sell 
cosmetic products. The American Academy of Dermatologists has taken the 
official stand that "selling products is permissible as long as it is in the 
best interest of the patient," according to J. Richard Allison Jr. of Columbia, 
S.C., chairman of the academy's ethics committee. But he and Eugene P. Schoch 
Jr. of Austin, Tex., another member of the committee, agree that patients 
become a captive audience for doctors eager to make a profit. "There's 
something psychological that happens when a doctor puts something in your hand 
and says, 'This is my product,' " says Allison. "It's a one-to-one relationship 
that can be exploited," Schoch adds. 
</P>
<P>
"I never tell patients they must use my products -- no reputable dermatologist 
would do that." Bussell says. "But I recommend them because I know exactly 
what's in them. I know I can stand behind them." 
</P>
<P>
Kligman says that although he suggests that his patients use a moisturizer with 
Retin-A, he does not single out RejuvenAge. In fact, Kligman says, he does not 
endorse RejuvenAge or any other cosmetic product. 
</P>
<P>
Are the products physicians sell really any better than the skin-care 
preparations sold in department stores and pharmacies? Obviously, the doctors 
who sell them think so. But ethics-committee member Schoch says: "They are 
absolutely not inherently better. Dermatologists are not pharmaceutical 
chemists, and they shouldn't try to be." On the other hand, Allison counters, 
some of the products may have value. "Some physicians started out as 
pharmacists -- they know what they're doing. Sometimes these products are the 
same things you can buy in a store, and other times they are not."

With talk of a possible actor's strike in July, studios have been reluctant to 
start new production after May 1. But there are some notable exceptions. . . . 
For the moment: Paramount has Tom Cruise to start "Born to Run" for producers 
Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer in June. The drama, set in the world of 
NASCAR racing, is based on a story by Cruise with Warren Skaaren currently 
working on the screenplay. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Film maker John Boorman has set Dabney Coleman as his modern-day King Lear in 
Disney's "Where the Heart Is," an April start in Toronto and New York City. The 
story centers on a captain of industry who decides that the best thing he can 
do for his children is to cut them off financially -- "about parents giving up 
their children when they come of age, and vice versa," producer-director 
Boorman said. Uma Thurman and Anthony Michael Hall are the unlucky kids. 
Boorman wrote the script with daughter Telsche. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Al Pacino takes on the role of crime chieftain Big Boy in Disney's "Dick Tracy" 
for producer-director-actor Warren Beatty. Meanwhile, actors are being paged to 
reshoot scenes with actress Glenne Headly who replaced Sean Young in the part 
of Tess Trueheart. . . . 
</P>
<P>
John Malkovich plays an ad executive who skyrockets sales with a policy of 
"honesty is the best policy" in Paramount's "Crazy People." The production 
marks "Good Morning, Vietnam" writer Mitch Markowitz's directing debut of his 
original story. Sydney Pollack, Tom Barad and Robert Weiss produce the April 
start. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Val Kilmer plays a low-rent detective in Propaganda Films' "Kill Me Again," an 
April start in Los Angeles based on the novel by Eric Knight. Joanne Whalley 
(Kilmer's real-life wife) co-stars as a woman who hires him to fake her death. 
John Dahl directs and co-wrote the yarn with David Warfield. Steve Golin, Joni 
Sighvatsson and Warfield produce, MGM releases. . Lou Diamond Phillips is a 
good cop in Interscope/Nelson Entertainment's "Transit," filming locally in 
April. Phillips brings to justice a serial killer, whose spirit goes looking 
for revenge after the execution. Robert Resnikoff wrote the script and makes 
his feature directing debut for producer David Madden. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Dermot Mulroney and Joanna Pacula head for Brazil in June to star in Filmline's 
"The Last Place God Made." Based on Jack Higgins' novel and adapted by Don 
Miller, the adventure finds two flyers caught up in intrigue and passion along 
the Amazon in 1938. N. Lee Lacy makes his big screen bow for producers Pieter 
Kroonenburg and Nicolas Clermont. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Stern is the big brother of Patrick Dempsey and Arye Gross in 
Universal's "Coupe de Ville," in which the fraternal trio transport a vintage 
Cadillac cross country for dad. Joe Roth directs Mike Binder's original script 
for producer Larry Brezner. . . . . Also taking to the road is Jonathan 
Silverman, who sets up a last trip for terminally ill buddy Jason Bateman in 
MCEG's "Sketches." Neal Israel directs the Paul Shapiro screenplay. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Brian Doyle-Murray joins the cast of Columbia's "Ghostbusters II" but not as 
Bill Murray's brother. In the Ivan Reitman production, Doyle-Murray will play a 
psychiatrist who must assess the spook fighters' mental stability. Also joining 
the antics: Eugene Levy as nerdy Rick Moranis' nerdy dermatologist cousin

EVERY GOOD COOK keeps on hand a small group of infallible, fast-and-easy 
"emergency" recipes. These are what one relies on when -- at 4:30 in the 
afternoon -- one urges friends dropping by to stay for dinner, knowing full 
well that the larder is bare and that there is little time for either shopping 
or meal preparation. 
</P>
<P>
Such a recipe is one for an attractive, very spicy shrimp dish that goes 
together quickly and easily. Camarones Rancheros is a colorful Mexican-style 
entree -- light enough to suit today's tastes and needs with only a modicum of 
accompaniment. Serve it with a Mexican- or Spanish-style rice -- homemade if 
there's time -- plus a crisp tossed salad. Dessert can be anything appealing 
from the market's bakery or freezer sections. 
</P>
<P>
Do be aware that this particular spicy shrimp dish is just that -- spicy. If 
your palate isn't geared to a plethora of hot chiles, you may want to add the 
jalapenos to the sauce gradually, tasting until you've reached the exact level 
of heat that pleases you. 
</P>
<P>
CAMARONES RANCHEROS 
</P>
<P>
1 clove garlic 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
6 fresh long green chiles 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup sliced onion 
</P>
<P>
2 jalapeno or guero (yellow) chiles, seeded and sliced 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon minced fresh cilantro leaves 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons butter or oil 
</P>
<P>
1 tomato, cored and diced 
</P>
<P>
Dash sugar 
</P>
<P>
2 dozen medium shrimp, peeled, cleaned and butterflied 
</P>
<P>
Oil 
</P>
<P>
Mash garlic in salt. Chop 2 long green chiles coarsely and set aside. Saute 
garlic, onion, jalapeno or guero chiles and cilantro in butter over low heat 
until onion is tender. Add tomato, chopped chiles and sugar to onion mixture 
and cook, stirring, 3 minutes. Set sauce aside. Char remaining long green 
chiles under broiler or over gas flame, turning frequently. Peel chiles and, 
leaving stems intact, split from tip to stem. Scrape out and discard seeds. Set 
green chiles aside. 
</P>
<P>
For each serving, saute 6 shrimp in 1 to 2 tablespoons oil 3 to 4 minutes or 
until shrimp turn pink. Add sauce to taste and cook 1 minute longer. Arrange 
shrimp over long green chiles and serve with Mexican rice, if desired. Makes 4 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: This is a spicy dish. If you prefer less authoritative flavoring, use 
fewer chiles.Photograph styling by Robin Tucker; food styled by Stephen Shern;

WINE: YOUNG BUT MATURE; 
</P>
<P>
BABCOCK WINES BEAR OUT THE PROMISE THEY SHOWED IN '87 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

FROM SMALL Babcock Vineyards comes big taste. 
</P>
<P>
I encountered Babcock Vineyards at the American Wine Expo in Dallas in 1987. 
The wines were excellent, as they are still. 
</P>
<P>
I keenly awaited the Babcock Gewurztraminer at the Dallas tasting. I held out 
my glass to the young man behind the counter, then swirled the wine and inhaled 
the exotic bouquet. 
</P>
<P>
Sensitive vinification had captured the luscious varietal's almost Oriental 
perfume of lychee fruit, which also suggests ripe pink grapefruit. 
</P>
<P>
"This is wonderful," I told the smiling young man, who turned out to be Bryan 
Babcock, maker of the wine. From under the counter, he proffered a sample of a 
late-harvest Johannisberg Riesling from his last vintage -- a berry-selected 
(37% Brix, 7% alcohol) 1986 nectar. Brilliant amber, it was a liquid poem of 
wine. 
</P>
<P>
I made notes to pursue the unreleased and unlabeled wine, the Gewurztraminer, 
and Babcock Vineyards. Among the hundreds of new wineries in California, this 
one has enormous promise. With a mere 7,000-case annual production and but 50 
planted acres on its 100-acre estate, Babcock has been discovered by 
Gewurztraminer aficionados. There is much to justify the true wine lover's 
attention, a significant achievement in the winery's short history. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, dentist Walter Babcock of Long Beach bought the 100-acre parcel near 
Lompoc. He and his wife considered making wine. 
</P>
<P>
For 18-year-old Bryan Babcock, a freshman at Occidental College majoring in 
liberal arts, the farm acquisition was not exciting, but the prospect of wine 
making interested him. 
</P>
<P>
Babcock was persuaded to pursue graduate studies in viticulture and enology at 
University of California at Davis. The day after he left college, in 1984, he 
was pouring concrete for the winery. The vines were in five-year maturity. And 
Bryan Babcock, wine maker, became a working reality. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, I sat down with him at the winery to a tasting of current release 
wines, beginning with his 1987 Santa Ynez Valley Sauvignon Blanc ($8). 
</P>
<P>
"It's barrel-fermented," he told me, "in French oak, 15% new. It has what I 
call an 'expanded style' . . . with about 30% malolactic fermentation and about 
six months on the lees." 
</P>
<P>
That "expanded style" totally tamed the "sauvage" quality of the grape, which 
is so often "wild" in its aggressive, grassy character. Here, the wine is 
wholly beguiling. It's one of the most delightful wines from Sauvignon Blanc 
grapes (100%) I've tasted. A second 1987 Sauvignon Blanc, dubbed "11 Oaks 
Ranch" ($18), with grapes from three nearby properties, also in "expanded 
style," is smooth and subtle. 
</P>
<P>
Where you'll find these wines, you'll probably also discover the Babcock 
Vineyards 1987 Santa Ynez Valley Chardonnay ($12), barrel-fermented, nine 
months on the lees, delicate in Meursault-style, and the 1987 Santa Ynez Valley 
Chardonnay-Selected Barrel Reserve ($18). It has a striking complexity and is 
totally balanced. 
</P>
<P>
And the wine under the counter in Texas? It's the 1986 Santa Ynez Valley 
Johannisberg Riesling, Berry-Selected, Late Harvest (10ths $37). The ultimate 
elixir of the grape, it would exhaust a vocabulary of superlatives to make 
adequate praise.

POPLINE: NO 'JOKE' BAND LABEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Chris Willman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The three former Bostonians who bill themselves as Christmas don't mind being 
told that their music has a certain flair for the absurd -- as well they 
shouldn't, with titles like that of their new album, "Ultraprophets of the 
Psykick Revolution," and satirical college radio hits like "Stupid Kids" and 
"Richard Nixon." 
</P>
<P>
What they do mind somewhat is being thought of as a "joke" band, even while 
writing songs about AIDS, wife beating, nuclear destruction and the like, and 
showing sure signs of solid pop-rock craftsmanship amid their 
left-of-centeredness. "We have definitely -- I hate to use the M-word -- 
matured," admits singer/drummer Liz Cox. 
</P>
<P>
Like Camper Van Beethoven, perhaps? "Camper Van Beethoven has turned out to be 
less of a novelty act than they appeared at first, and in some ways we do have 
something in common with them," says singer/guitarist Michael Cudahy, sporting 
a nude-Madonna T-shirt and acting just a little like an insidious Ed Grimley. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that humor -- or, musically, any kind of weirdness -- corrupts the 
rest of it so that people go, 'Oh, they're a funny band.' But absurd isn't the 
antithesis of serious. It's more than just finding everything to be a joke when 
you find everything to be absurd." 
</P>
<P>
"Ya talk about absurd!" exclaims Cox. "We're living there: Absurd, U.S.A." 
</P>
<P>
She's referring to the group's new hometown: Las Vegas. Upon leaving its 
previous independent label (Big Time) to sign with a West Coast major (I.R.S.), 
Cudahy, Cox and bass player Dan Castelli packed up and moved from Boston, a 
city with a thriving music scene befitting its offbeat stance, to a city with a 
music scene thriving around Frank Sinatra Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Says Cox, "It's the big fish in a little pond scenario: 'Hi! We're the best new 
band in town! Where do we park our van?' I suppose that sounds conceited, but 
there aren't too many bands there." 
</P>
<P>
"It's true," confirms Cudahy. "We are the best rock band in Las Vegas. I'm sure 
of it. As the Legendary Stardust Cowboy says, 'They're not such a big market 
for our kind of entertainment here.' " Chris Willman

COMING SOON : SNEAK PREVIEWS OF FORTHCOMING BOOKS OF SPECIAL INTEREST TO 
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS; 
</P>
<P>
GOING WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL PAISNER , From The Imperfect Mirror: Inside Stories of Television 
Newswomen, by Daniel Paisner, to be published this month by William Morrow 
&amp; Co. Connie Chung was co-anchor for KNXT-TV from 1976 to 1983. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
'So Connie Chung disappeared to Los Angeles.' ' 
</P>
<P>
IN 1976, AFTER covering McGovern and Watergate for the CBS News Washington 
bureau, Connie Chung decided that living and working in one city her entire 
life (save for a two-year stint in Houston during junior high school while her 
father was assigned there) was not a good thing. Coinciding with her thinking 
was an offer from CBS-owned-and-operated station KNXT-TV. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked about it," Chung says, "and I thought, 'Now, why would I want to do 
that? Here I am at the creme-de-la-creme network, which it really was at that 
time. Why in the world would I want to leave?' And then I thought, 'Well, you 
know, I'm 29 years old -- maybe I should live in another city for a while. 
Maybe it would be good for me.' I felt that I was still kind of suffering from 
the post-Watergate syndrome. So I thought, 'Head west. Go to California.' 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been the pick-up-and-leave sort of person," she says. "I can't 
believe that I did it, actually. The funny thing is that what they offered me 
to stay was anchoring the 'CBS Morning News.' At that time, I'd substituted a 
lot at the 'Morning News,' but I didn't think that was a particularly great 
place to go, because, at that time, when people anchored the 'CBS Morning News' 
and then returned to regular reporting, their colleagues wondered where they'd 
been. They thought they had disappeared off the face of the Earth." 
</P>
<P>
So Chung disappeared to the West Coast, making what many in the television-news 
industry would consider a backward career move, to anchor local news, albeit in 
the No. 2 market in the country. She didn't want her friends in Washington to 
think that she "went Hollywood," so she threw herself into her work. She 
anchored the 11 o'clock news and the early 6 o'clock broadcast. Eventually she 
added the 4:30 newscast, in addition to the Pacific Coast news digest for CBS. 
She also reported, she says, because she "didn't want to be held hostage at the 
anchor desk." 
</P>
<P>
Before too long, though, Chung looked up from her grueling schedule and began 
to feel she was missing something: "Somehow I felt that I was three hours 
behind, even though it was local news and it was on time for Los Angeles. It's 
just that things were happening around the country and I wouldn't know about 
them. I was still asleep in the morning. Also, I was getting tired of the 
murders, fires, floods -- that kind of thing," she says. "I wanted to cover big 
fires, big floods." 
</P>
<P>
The decision to move back East was motivated also by the chance at a lasting 
relationship with the man to whom she is now married, Maury Povich, of "Current 
Affair." Theirs had always been a commuter relationship. "We hadn't planned to 
get married," Chung says, "but maybe we were thinking we would give it a chance 
if we were at least on the same coast." 
</P>
<P>
By the time her second three-year contract was due to expire, in 1983, Chung 
had sent out feelers to all three networks. Among the people she talked to was 
Bill Small, her former boss at the CBS News Washington bureau, who was then 
with NBC News. He offered her a job anchoring the network's new early-morning 
newscast, "NBC News at Sunrise." She cut short her commitments to CBS and 
returned east to NBC in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm torn between anchoring and reporting," she says. Currently she anchors the 
"NBC Nightly News" on Saturdays and serves as one of the two principal 
substitutes for Tom Brokaw on the weeknight broadcasts. Two or three times a 
week she anchors "NBC News Digest." And her week is filled with reporting 
assignments for various NBC reports. "Right now," she says, "I have the best of 
both worlds."

POPEYE: JEFFERSON AIRPLANE SET TO TAKE OFF AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty-two years after the Summer of Love, the Jefferson Airplane is revving up 
its rusty propellers and eyeing the pop skies again. 
</P>
<P>
The seminal San Francisco psychedelic band, which hadn't released an album 
under its original name since 1973 (the group partially re-formed in 1974 as 
the Starship), is going into the studio in a matter of weeks to begin recording 
a new album. 
</P>
<P>
"If you'd told me we were going to do this two years ago, I'd have said you 
were crazy," said Grace Slick, phoning from Marin County where she was nursing 
the flu. "(Co-founder) Paul Kantner and I were still at each other's throats, 
and everyone else was pursuing other interests. . . . But time heals all 
wounds." 
</P>
<P>
Slick said Airplane members Jack Casady and Jorma Kaukonen, who perform as Hot 
Tuna, recently played some dates with Kantner, who in turn invited Slick to a 
show in San Francisco. She sat in, singing a few songs, including an acoustic 
version of "White Rabbit." 
</P>
<P>
"It was very casual, but we all enjoyed it -- and better still, the audience 
seemed to enjoy it," she said. "So we took that as a promising sign." (The only 
original member still holding out is Marty Balin, who "might" become involved 
as the project unfolds.) Slick said the band has a new manager -- HK 
Management's Trudy Green -- and is about to sign a one-shot record deal, with 
RCA Records (the group's original label) as a possible contender. 
</P>
<P>
If the Airplane was the enfant terrible of '60s rock outfits, then Slick was 
the psychedelic era's most colorful media quote machine. Even in middle age 
(she turns 50 in October!) she still displays an appealingly irreverent 
attitude toward careerdom. 
</P>
<P>
"Honey, getting this band back together is a mind-boggling procedure," she 
said. "For the last four months, we've been making phone calls for three hours 
a day, talking to managers and lawyers and accountants and more lawyers, either 
trying to infiltrate or extricate ourselves from all sorts of crazy contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone has all these old ties. Even me. I have to detach myself from the 
Starship because we owe RCA one more album." She laughed. "And I own 51% of the 
stock in the group so I just can't walk away from it." 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Starship had largely relied on outside songwriters whose 
material brought the band three No. 1 hits, but little respect. "I'm sure it 
was very gratifying for those hotshot L.A. songwriters, but I missed being 
involved something terrible," Slick said. "When I started writing again last 
summer, I realized how much songwriting meant to me." 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's hard to imagine the Airplane recapturing much of its former glory. 
In recent years, a wide variety of oldster bands -- from the Doobie Brothers to 
CSN&amp;Y -- have re-formed, with depressing results. "As far as I'm concerned, 
we're going for the music," said Slick. "We're not trying to recapture the '60s 
-- that would be pretty nauseating. We're not trying to tear down the walls 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
But is Slick comfortable hanging onto her rock identity at 50? "I'm not 
comfortable with anything. When I was 25, I made a lot of pronouncements. I 
read some quotes I'd made recently and I thought, 'Oh, you fool!' But that's 
the beauty of rock. It's still so young as an art form that there aren't a lot 
of specific rules -- and you can always break the ones that are there. I don't 
feel old at 50. I'd just like another 100 years or so!"

QUOTE OF THE WEEK: We've seen some pretty odd couples -- but rap icons Ice T, 
Slick Rick and Fab Five Freddy with . . . Malcolm Forbes? It all happened at 
MTV's noisy post-Grammy's Rap Party, where the world's hippest 69-year-old 
Capitalist Kingpin (and frequent Liz Taylor date) mixed with rap royalty like 
DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, Kool Moe Dee, JJ Fad and Salt 'n Pepa. 
(Dennis Hopper was there too, but who noticed?) As he posed for pictures, 
Forbes eyed the rap posse's shiny assortment of rings and monster cables, 
quipping: "Liz's jewelry has nothing on you guys!"

THE LILAC TIME"The Lilac Time." Mercury ** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
One-time British New Romantic pop-fop star Stephen Duffy's transformation, in 
these folkier days, into contemplative idyllist may strike some (at least the 
few in the United States who have heard of him) as a bit calculated. But this 
album is so fresh and understatedly from-the-heart that if it is a calculation, 
it's a good one all around. As on the Waterboys' "Fisherman's Blues," the 
balance between the contemplation (primarily on the state of the English 
mind-set and the state of love) and the idyllic sound (lotsa airy acoustic 
guitars and lilting hooks, but not at the expense of drive) is the key: Call it 
strum and Drang. Maybe the sound's not entirely new, but it's truly romantic.

REPLAY: A HILLBILLY TREASURE FROM THE VAULTS OF CAPITOL; 
</P>
<P>
THIS FEATURE SPOTLIGHTS NOTEWORTHY COMPILATIONS AND REISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Album: "Hillbilly Music . . . Thank God! Volume 1." Bug Records/Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
Artists: Merle Travis, Hank Thompson, Buck Owens, Faron Young, Louvin Brothers, 
Tennessee Ernie Ford, Rose Maddox, others. 
</P>
<P>
History: "Hillbilly music" was country music, when country wasn't cool. 
Emerging in the 1920s from its folk roots in the Appalachians -- largely 
through recordings of pioneering performers such as Jimmie Rodgers and the 
Carter Family -- its popularity spread in subsequent decades through the South 
into the Southwest, and eventually throughout the world. Generally, the music 
referred to as hillbilly differed from the "Western" branch of country (made 
famous in the 1930s and '40s by Gene Autry, Roy Rogers and other singing cowboy 
movie stars) by its rural, backwoods underpinnings and frequently mournful, 
melancholy lyrics. It's this brand of seminal country music that has been so 
successfully resuscitated in recent years by Emmylou Harris, Randy Travis, 
Dwight Yoakam and the other "new traditionalists." 
</P>
<P>
Sound: This first-rate double album is drawn from the Capitol Records vaults. 
The music dates from the late '40s into the '60s.(All the recording information 
was lost, so dates of the individual sessions are not known.) When Capitol 
Records opened its doors in Los Angeles in the '40s, a major part of the 
label's prerock-era success was from hits by country artists signed right here. 
This retrospective spans the label's major artists (Hank Thompson, Merle 
Travis, Faron Young, the Louvins) to the truly obscure (the Farmer Boys, the 
Milo Twins). There's a healthy nod to Buck Owens, with two of his own 
performances as well as two other Owens songs, one recorded by Rose Maddox and 
one by the Farmer Boys. If the term hillbilly music was something of a 
pejorative, the songs often compensated for trivial subject matter with 
inventive word play, engaging harmonies or simply a healthy sense of humor. And 
snobs who might turn up their noses at the very idea of hillbilly musicianship 
should listen to "Stratosphere Boogie," a rip-roaring exercise in dexterity by 
steel guitar duo Jimmy Bryant and Speedy West. The liner notes by the album's 
producer, rock singer Marshall Crenshaw, are informal, spirited and 
informative, and the remastered sound is remarkably clean throughout. RANDY

Just when it seemed that art had mined every conceivable medium, along comes an 
exhibit that's alive with surprises. The works in "Eco-Systems" at the Santa 
Barbara Contemporary Arts Forum incorporate more than 65,000 living creatures, 
namely snakes, frogs, guppies and swarms of ants and bees. 
</P>
<P>
These animals populate large installations by Michael Paha, John Roloff, Mark 
Thompson and Remo Campopiano. The installations, all containing animals whose 
behavior can't be predicted or controlled, are sort of "art as research," said 
arts forum director Betty Klausner. 
</P>
<P>
The gist of the show is summed up in a statement by Paha, whose 24-foot-long 
environment will be "like something we might find below city streets," Klausner 
said before the artist had begun installation. The piece, "Other Worlds Near to 
Us," will be a "dark, mysterious" habitat containing rocks, water, soil and 
urban debris -- trash, bottle caps and spent shotgun shells -- and snakes, 
frogs and insects, Klausner said. 
</P>
<P>
Writes Paha: "My goal is to set up the situation, arranging for a set of 
activities to occur by chance, and then letting all the elements take their 
natural course." 
</P>
<P>
Said Klausner: "All four of these artists are doing that: Setting up situations 
with live elements -- with live animals -- and then indeed, seeing what 
happens. This is art as research in a very major way." 
</P>
<P>
Roloff, who will construct two spherical glass and steel greenhouse structures, 
one installed at the arts forum, the other at Santa Barbara's Museum of Natural 
History, "unleashes environmental conditions to see what happens," Klausner 
said. Collectively titled "Oculus," his forms will hold water where algae will 
grow over the length of the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
"He is seeking information about the unknown and what's important to him is 
transformation and change," Klausner said, noting the artist's long-time 
interest in geology. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson's long-held passion has been apian. His work "Idiot Boy" immerses 
viewers in a room redolent with the scent of honey, illuminated by amber light 
filtered through wax-covered windows, and abuzz with the sound of bees -- about 
60,000 bees -- swarming inside a hive. The title refers to a short story, 
posted outside the room, about a mentally retarded boy "immersed in the world 
of bees," Klausner said. 
</P>
<P>
The largest piece in the unusual exhibit is Campopiano's "Fish-Breeder," which 
consists of 10 wall-size test tubes. Filled with breeding guppies, the giant 
decanters deposit the guppies' babies into a pond. In the pond are Styrofoam 
mounds covered with thousands of ants. 
</P>
<P>
"Around the edge of the pond, there will be a place where you can actually 
kneel down and observe what's going on with the ants and the guppies," Klausner 
said. "It's a combination of science -- represented by the test tubes -- and 
the natural world. 
</P>
<P>
"As well as being sort of weirdly compelling imagery, these pieces will make 
you stop and think a great deal about our environment -- what's out there and 
what we're doing with it," Klausner said. 
</P>
<P>
"Eco-Systems," through April 8, is financed in part by a grant from the 
National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
PICTURES FOR POSTERITY: The Richard Avedon archive, consisting of more than 
1,000 prints, negatives, transparencies, correspondence, books and memorabilia, 
has been acquired by the University of Arizona's Center for Creative 
Photography. 
</P>
<P>
"The great weakness in art history is the confusion between the life of the 
artist and the life of the work," said Avedon, renowned for portraiture and 
fashion photography, about the acquisition. The center, a leading museum of 
20th-Century photography, "is the only museum of photography that honors that 
distinction and devotes itself to both. I feel that my work is now in better 
hands than my own," he said. 
</P>
<P>
ALL AROUND TOWN: A festival of exhibits, performances, classes and other 
cultural activities will be ooheld Saturday and Sunday at each of 10 art 
centers operated by the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department. 
</P>
<P>
The festival, called "Center Connections," will offer such events as a 
student-faculty art exhibit at the North Valley Arts Center in Granada Hills 
and a mono print workshop at Art-in-the Park in Arroyo-Seco Park. 
</P>
<P>
Free bus transportation between the art centers will be offered. Information: 
(213) 485-2433.

NOTEBOOK: YOUNG CHEFS TO GET TASTE OF COMPETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you want to learn how to be a chef, go to Europe -- that's the career advice 
would-be Wolfgang Pucks and Michel Richards typically receive. The reason? 
There just aren't that many places in the U.S. that train chefs beyond the 
competent banquet/hotel level. "It's an emptiness of education," says Chez 
Melange co-owner Michael Franks, "especially in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Franks, like a lot of other food lovers, would like to change the culinary 
education scene. His contribution: the Young Chefs of the South Bay 
Competition, scheduled this year for April 8, at El Camino College. "I thought, 
Americans are always so competitive," says Franks, who schedules special menus 
(e.g., Provence Prix Fixe, Grazing Prix Fixe) and wine tastings at his Redondo 
Beach restaurant year-round, "why not start the ball rolling with a contest for 
aspiring chefs?" 
</P>
<P>
This is the second year Franks has held the competition that is open to South 
Bay high school students -- each school sends a three-person team to prepare a 
three-course meal made with ingredients specified by the contest rules (sole 
stuffed with shrimp is this year's entree course). Last year, Spago's Wolfgang 
Puck and St. Estephe's John Sedlar helped judge. This year, Sedlar, Kate 
Mantilini's Marilyn Lewis, Chez Melange chef and co-owner Robert Bell and 
others will award the gold, silver and bronze medals that come with scholarship 
money (donated by American Express) for each member of the top three teams. All 
of the participants receive certificates and commemorative T-shirts donated by 
Nordstrom. The deadline for entry is this Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE DOMINO EFFECT: Somebody had to do it sooner or later. Domino's Pizza mogul 
Tom Monaghan has announced that construction will begin next year on a, yes, 
Leaning Tower of Pizza -- a 30-story skyscraper on a 15-degree rake, officially 
called Domino's Tower. It's to be erected just outside Ann Arbor, Mich., as the 
superpopular pizza firm's new corporate headquarters. Monaghan is a well-known 
architecture buff and collector of Frank Lloyd Wright furniture and buildings. 
The architect in this case is Gunnar Birkerts, who will reportedly install a 
chapel on the top floor of the building. For the sake of comparison, it might 
be noted that the Leaning Tower of Pisa, which wasn't supposed to lean, sits on 
a 5.2-degree angle.

BIRTHDAYS AND BIRTH NOTES: It's Happy Birthday this month to West Beach Cafe in 
Venice, 10 years old; to Giuseppe! Ristorante in Beverly Hills, also 10; and to 
La Famiglia in Beverly Hills, 15. . . . The Cat &amp; the Custard Cup 
celebrates its own 10th anniversary March 6 and 7 by serving lunch and dinner 
both days from its very first menu, at the original prices. (Dinner prices, for 
instance, run $8.50 to $11.95 for main dishes, with appetizers at $2.50.) No 
reservations will be accepted these two days. . . . Caliente, featuring 
"Texas-style smoked meats from its custom-built smokehouse, as well as 
traditional Mexican favorites," has just opened in Irvine by the El Torito 
chain. . . . And Garduno's is new in Costa Mesa, serving Italian food from a 
single menu day and night. . . .

CULINARY CALENDAR: Jonathan Waxman's elegantly Californian Jams in New York 
City turned into the more casual "Jonathan Waxman's" last year and then closed 
altogether this January -- but it will be reborn briefly this Tuesday through 
Thursday, when Waxman himself cooks dishes from the Jams menu at the Parkway 
Grill in Pasadena. . . . Chanteclair in Irvine has inaugurated a series of 
weekly wine tastings, every Thursday from 5 to 7 p.m. A different winery is 
featured each week, with samples poured for $2 per generous helping. 
Complimentary hot and cold appetizers are included. . . . After four years of 
dinner-only service, the Palace Cafe in Santa Barbara now serves lunch on 
Thursdays and Fridays. . . . UCLA Extension's Division of Culinary Arts holds a 
free open house next Saturday, March 11, from 10 p.m. Various professional and 
extracurricular culinary programs will be discussed. Reservations are required, 
and may be made by calling (213) 206-8120. . . . The original El Cholo on 
Western Avenue takes part in a progressive dinner, dubbed "Over 200 Years of 
Dining in L.A.," on March 20. For $50 per person, all-inclusive, participants 
begin with margaritas and nachos at the 1927-vintage El Cholo, move on to a 
full-scale Italian dinner at Little Joe's downtown (1910) and finish with 
cheesecake and pie at Philippe, also downtown (1908). Travel is by chartered 
bus. Call any of the three restaurants for more information. . . . And the 
husband-and-wife team of Jean-Pierre Moulle and Denise Lurton-Moulle is 
offering five one-week visits to Bordeaux this summer, each with a maximum of 
eight guests, for $2,450 per person -- air fare not included. Moulle was chef 
at Chez Panisse in Berkeley for seven years, and his wife's family owns a 
number of well-known Bordeaux chateaux (La Louviere and Clos Fourtet among 
them). Their weeklong program includes visits to markets, restaurants and 
numerous chateaux (including Margaux and Mouton), plus home-cooked meals and a 
fisherman's picnic. Write to the Moulles at P.O. Box 8191, Berkeley, 94707 for 
details.

Every year, at Grammy award time, we are reminded by Robert Hilburn of the 
"travesty" when the Captain and Tennille won their Grammy in 1975 for "Love 
Will Keep Us Together." 
</P>
<P>
I always kind of wondered why Hilburn was so disturbed by this; after all, 14 
years have passed. Then, lo and behold, there was the answer in a chart that 
ran with "At Long Last, the Grammys Grow Up," his Feb. 19 article: "Love Will 
Keep Us Together" edged out "Born to Run" by Hilburn's all-time fave, Bruce 
Springsteen!

TALE OF TWO CRITICS

<TEXT>
<P>
My question to Times critic Dan Sullivan is why did he think Peter's piece 
required a rejoinder in the first place? Is Dan so paranoid that this British 
counterpart might be right that he felt the compulsion to strike down what 
Peter wrote? 
</P>
<P>
The fact is, having read Sullivan's criticisms for many years, I have never 
gotten the impression that Sullivan himself thinks terribly highly of theater 
in Los Angeles, and that he would be much happier reviewing plays in London or 
New York.

Martin Scorsese should not have been nominated for best director ("The Last 
Temptation of Christ"). He should have been nominated for best con man for 
displaying a caricature of Jesus Christ in 70 millimeter and fooling a lot of 
intelligent people into believing his film had accomplished something 
honorable. 
</P>
<P>
If he thinks he has a chance of winning, he is indulging in still another 
fantasy.

The international uproar over the novel "The Satanic Verses" should be called 
"The Last Temptation of Christ -- Part II." Whether it's Islamic leaders 
threatening the life of an author or Christians burning theaters in France for 
showing Oscar nominee Scorsese's "Last Temptation," it gives religion a bad 
name. 
</P>
<P>
These attempts at artistic suppression have served only to motivate people to 
(1) buy a book that doesn't exactly sound like zippy material and (2) see a 
film they wouldn't have wanted to see.

EASTERN MACHINISTS STRIKE; AIRLINE PLEDGES TO OPERATE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Union mechanics and baggage handlers struck Eastern Airlines at midnight 
Friday, refusing to accept the carrier's demands for wage cuts and threatening 
to obstruct mass transit nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a strike at Eastern Airlines," said Wally Haber, head of the 
machinists union at the carrier just as the clock passed midnight. Haber said 
picket lines would be set up immediately. 
</P>
<P>
National Mediation Board Chairman Walter C. Wallace said the talks between the 
two sides ended on a "professional if not cordial" note. The mediator said both 
sides were free to resume talks anytime. 
</P>
<P>
The company's proposed contract would reduce hourly top-scale mechanics' wages 
by 15% -- from $18.83 to $16 -- and baggage handlers' by 26% -- from $15.60 to 
$11.54. 
</P>
<P>
The strike was called after Eastern made a last-ditch offer to the union that 
company officials said protected past wage increases and job security for 8,500 
union aircraft mechanics and baggage handlers. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, in an unpredecented action, President Bush rejected a 
recommendation from federal mediators to order an emergency 60-day cooling-off 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern vowed to keep operating a limited schedule with management pilots and 
substitute mechanics, which the airline hired and trained especially for the 
strike. In preparation for the strike, Eastern eliminated up to 75% of its 
weekend schedule. 
</P>
<P>
A union official said the machinists were ready for "war." 
</P>
<P>
In a related action, the Airline Pilots Assn. announced that, in the event of 
an Eastern strike, next Tuesday its 40,000 members will begin to precisely 
follow flying procedures, causing "substantial" airport delays. 
</P>
<P>
Bush warned organized labor that his Administration wouldn't tolerate sympathy 
actions in support of the machinists, who were sent home for the day Friday by 
the airline to prevent what management called sabotage by militants. 
</P>
<P>
The AFL-CIO has urged all members to honor picket lines, and the machinists 
have vowed to picket trains, ports and other airlines. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, U.S. District Judge John H. Pratt ruled that machinists at other 
airlines could not honor Eastern machinists' picket lines in view of no-strike, 
no-slowdown clauses in their contracts with other carriers. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told a news conference that the 
Transportation Department "will monitor the situation and will, in addition, 
take whatever steps are needed to protect the safety of the traveling public." 
</P>
<P>
Eastern said it was cutting up to 75% of scheduled weekend flights, including 
most service from its Atlanta hub and about 60 other cities. 
</P>
<P>
Service will be maintained to about 50 cities, including most flights from 
Miami and on the airline's Northeast shuttle and Latin American routes, said 
Joseph Leonard, Eastern's chief operating officer and executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern said it was prepared to operate during a strike and had contracted with 
1,100 non-union mechanics to service its planes. Leonard said Eastern could fly 
indefinitely with 200 management pilots and those who cross picket lines if 
pilots honor a walkout. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard told reporters in Miami that the paid day off for machinists wasn't a 
lockout or an attempt to affect the bargaining. Eastern took the action after a 
federal judge said it was necessary to ensure passengers' safety, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's refusal to invoke an emergency mediation panel and impose a 60-day 
cooling-off period in the 17-month-old dispute marked his first major 
labor-crisis decision. 
</P>
<P>
To Eastern's machinists, it signaled a major dimming of hope. "The reaction 
here is we would just as soon get it over with," said Rick Iacino, a machinists 
general chairman. "Our people are pumped up; they're ready. War has been 
declared." 
</P>
<P>
The airline, which says it is losing $1 million a day, has been seeking $150 
million in concessions from the machinists. Management made a new offer 
Thursday that leaders of the 8,500-member union -- which includes mechanics, 
baggage handlers and other ground workers -- said offered little improvement. 
</P>
<P>
The AFL-CIO and 33 senators led by Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) wanted Bush to 
intervene to prevent "a major disruption of interstate commerce." 
</P>
<P>
Eastern flies about 100,000 people a day with an average of 1,040 daily 
flights. It has 250 airliners. 
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old, Miami-based carrier, owned by Texas Air Corp., wanted Bush to 
stay out of the dispute, claiming that it could not afford any delay. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern's pilots rejected an appeal Thursday by Texas Air Chairman Frank 
Lorenzo for them to sign a new contract and cross machinists' picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern flight attendants said they would honor picket lines, although Lorenzo 
-- who in 1983 took Continental Airlines into bankruptcy reorganization to end 
a labor confrontation -- has warned that the action could land Eastern "in the 
corporate graveyard." 
</P>
<P>
Airports nationwide strengthened security and made contingencies for dealing 
with the strike. Other airlines, some of which have refused to promise to honor 
Eastern tickets, reported surges in sales last week. 
</P>
<P>
"We will do our best to assist Eastern passengers should there be a work 
stoppage," said Delta Air Lines, which arranged to accept Eastern tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard said the company had experienced "significant amounts of vandalism" and 
got permission from U.S. District Judge C. Clyde Atkins in Miami to send 
workers home. Atkins said it was necessary for passengers' safety.

BLOOMING IN THE RUST: NEW USES TRANSFORMING OLD MILL TOWNS

ALIQUIPPA, Pa. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LTV Steel's once-mighty Aliquippa Works, which hugs the Ohio River for seven 
miles west of Pittsburgh, finally is being torn down, yard by rusty yard, and 
union boss Rich Vallecorsa is shedding no tears. 
</P>
<P>
About 8,000 workers once toiled at the plant, turning limestone, iron ore and 
coal into America's pipe, wire and tin plate. Only about 900 workers remain in 
two small mills that have managed to prove their profitability in the fickle 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
But Vallecorsa, president of United Steelworkers Local 1211, won't fight for 
the old plant. 
</P>
<P>
"Why raise people's hopes? As long as the mill is standing there, rotting away, 
there's a false sense of hope it is going to start again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Along the 80-mile-long steel valley of the Ohio and Monongahela rivers, closed 
plants are being demolished in preparation for their metamorphosis as 
industrial parks, high-tech centers and even amusement parks. 
</P>
<P>
From Chicago to Buffalo, large manufacturing plants are undergoing similar 
transformations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Greening of the Valley' 
</P>
<P>
"It's like the greening of the valley," said Steve Barrouk, director of the 
Allegheny County Industrial Development Authority. "We're changing from gray to 
green, essentially. We're looking at open space, clean, light industrial 
development and some heavier activity." 
</P>
<P>
From 1979 to 1987 more than 67,000 jobs in basic steel and 63,000 jobs in heavy 
manufacturing were lost in the Pittsburgh area. Companies closed within days, 
sometimes overnight, leaving behind eerie, ghost town-like plants where coats 
still hung on hooks and lunch boxes waited to be opened. 
</P>
<P>
While social service agencies tried to help the displaced workers, planners 
turned their attention to the shuttered plants themselves. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, they looked at mills in the Monongahela Valley south of 
Pittsburgh, the cradle of America's steel industry. For psychological and 
economic reasons, they believed the change had to begin there or the valley, so 
dependent on steel for so many decades, would wither. 
</P>
<P>
"Around the end of the '70s and the early '80s, we were experiencing a major 
shutdown every week," Barrouk said. "The magnitude was such that it was almost 
impossible to respond in any way you thought was adequate. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of major facilities in private, corporate hands, and the 
companies were not interested in being landlords." 
</P>
<P>
Public and private entrepreneurs with a vision stepped in. Although there's no 
general, long-term plan for the region, a quiet renaissance in real estate has 
emerged. Some examples: 
</P>
<P>
* Just 6 miles from downtown Pittsburgh, USX Corp.'s century-old Homestead 
Works is being turned into a new alloy of light manufacturing plants, offices 
and a riverfront playground with water slides, a boardwalk and a sandy beach. 
</P>
<P>
* Within five minutes of downtown Pittsburgh, the former J&amp;L Steel Corp.'s 
Hazelwood plant is becoming the city's version of California's Silicon Valley. 
Bulldozers have cleared the way for the Pittsburgh Technology Center, a site 
for developing robots, computer programs and research into biotechnology. 
</P>
<P>
* In Glassport, about 10 miles southeast of Pittsburgh, the former Copperweld 
Corp. wire manufacturing plant is the home of 14 companies producing windows, 
ball bearings, steel rods and futuristic airbuses. 
</P>
<P>
* In neighboring McKeesport and Duquesne, USX Corp. last year turned its 
National and Duquesne works over to Barrouk's agency in what is believed to be 
the nation's largest transfer of industrial property to local governmental 
agencies for redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
* In a region known as the "electric valley," Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s 
East Pittsburgh Works, which built the equipment used to bring affordable 
electricity to many of America's cities, is being turned into an urban 
industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
At an international conference on urban renewal, a team of experts led by 
Britain's Prince Charles descended upon the valley last year to examine ways to 
revitalize the area. In general, their ideas validated what some private and 
public developers already had planned or begun. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone has been receptive. 
</P>
<P>
Those who believe basic steel can bounce back say that demolishing plants like 
Homestead is akin to hammering the last nail in the coffin of the nation's 
old-fashioned, integrated mills and the communities that became dependent on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"In many cases, these facilities were horrendously managed," said Bob Erickson 
of the Steel Valley Authority, which is trying to maintain steel making in the 
Mon Valley. 
</P>
<P>
With leaner, smaller operations that can respond more quickly to changes in the 
market, some doomed plants still could be producing steel profitably, Erickson 
said. In some cases, steel is even being manufactured on a limited scale at 
plants that are being demolished, such as Aliquippa. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Steel No Longer Feasible 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, point to study after study that have determined that steel 
making at many of the facilities is no longer feasible. The future for the 
sites, they say, is to offer a more diverse mix of goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to get jobs back," Barrouk said. "But instead of one manufacturer 
that has a club of influence on a community, we're talking about dozens of 
manufacturers." 
</P>
<P>
Erickson questions whether such sites are truly marketable. 
</P>
<P>
"They're unattractive," he said. "They have high taxes, poor access, bad public 
service and bad school systems. The locations aren't conducive to light 
industry or high technology without a lot of work being done." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Park, whose company is developing the Homestead Works, acknowledges that 
it will take millions of dollars to clean the sites of pollutants and build 
roads, bridges and sewer and water lines. But he said once the stage is set, 
there will be plenty of interested actors. 
</P>
<P>
"You take 100 acres in the Mon Valley and put in sewer and water lines and it 
will fill up," said Park, vice president of the Cleveland-based Park Corp. 
</P>
<P>
For the last year, giant shears have been nibbling away at Andrew Carnegie's 
citadel of steel and smoke in Homestead, slowly demolishing the plant that once 
employed 15,000 and supplied massive amounts of armor plate in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The Park Corp., which liquidates and recycles industrial property, bought most 
of the 3 1/2-mile-long plant from USX for more than $2.75 million. Kennywood 
Park, an amusement park, bought the rest. 
</P>
<P>
"If this development happens as we anticipate, I can imagine streets here with 
names like Open Hearth Avenue," Park said. "This is going to be a real 
showplace, with heavy and light manufacturing and some commercial and 
recreational ventures." 
</P>
<P>
A brick building that was the site of the bloody 1892 labor dispute pitting 
Carnegie's Pinkerton guards against striking steelworkers -- a battle that set 
the unionization of steel workers back 50 years -- may be preserved as a 
historic landmark. 
</P>
<P>
A community-based credit union plans to construct a $1-million building on a 
former parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Park also may restart two mills within the plant, and a local investment group 
is trying to buy part of the plant and produce steel for use in farm equipment, 
cars and major appliances. 
</P>
<P>
At one end of the site, bulldozers are clearing brush and debris and regrading 
land for the water park, scheduled to open this July. 
</P>
<P>
Kennywood President Carl Hughes said the park is the brainchild of an associate 
who felt that Pittsburgh, nearly 400 miles from the ocean, needed a beach. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was the Homestead property available, but it has a gentle slope and 
offers a view across the river of a densely wooded hillside. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are going to be astounded when they see this," Hughes said. 
"It's such a sylvan setting. It's almost impossible to imagine it's an old 
steel mill." 
</P>
<P>
Hughes said the park will feature 18 water slides, a boardwalk, a wading pool 
and a channel for floaters -- this in the midst of a rough-and-tumble town 
known more for its food banks and soup kitchens than recreation. 
</P>
<P>
If it is successful, he plans to build a large marina and floating restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
A few miles upstream, Glassport's fortunes sank with heavy manufacturing. And 
in the mid-'80s, when the county bought Copperweld's vacant Glassport plant, 
the economic climate for start-up companies didn't appear too bright. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Eeriest Feeling' 
</P>
<P>
"When we walked through the plant, it was the eeriest feeling because the 
papers were still on the desks, jackets were still hung on hooks. Lunch boxes 
weren't even opened," Barrouk said. "People were given one-day notice when they 
left that place. It was like a neutron bomb. It was just like walking through a 
ghost town." 
</P>
<P>
Using public funds, the county and an incubator group bought the mile-long 
facility in 1984 for $600,000 and spent $2.5 million to renovate it. 
</P>
<P>
Officials hoped they could find tenants within five years. It took less than 
two. 
</P>
<P>
The site houses 13 companies employing about 200 people, most of whom were 
hired locally, and the county is considering buying adjacent property. 
</P>
<P>
The activity has pumped some life into Glassport itself, said Ron Stuart, who 
manages the facility. 
</P>
<P>
"Where the restaurants were closed before, people now have lunch. Rite-Aid is 
putting in a brand new drugstore down the street -- the first new building 
Glassport has seen since Hitler was a corporal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Heady with Glassport's success, the county last November bought two landmark 
steel mills -- USX Corp.'s National Works in McKeesport and its sister plant, 
the Duquesne Works, across the river. 
</P>
<P>
The 360-acre package cost the county $3.6 million, which won't be paid until 
the land is redeveloped and sold. 
</P>
<P>
Barrouk estimates that the cost of redevelopment could reach $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
In Pittsburgh, the Jones &amp; Laughlin steel mill -- once a symbol of the 
city's grimy past -- is perhaps one of the best examples of the city's clean, 
new future. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the city and county bought 52 acres for $4 million and, in conjunction 
with the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie-Mellon University, are 
redeveloping it to make room for the Pittsburgh Technology Center, a high-tech 
industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Master Plan 
</P>
<P>
A master plan adopted last year calls for each university to develop a portion 
within six to seven years. 
</P>
<P>
"We took a calculated gamble," said Evans Stoddard of the city's Urban 
Redevelopment Authority. 
</P>
<P>
Stoddard said the high cost of developing the land -- more than $500,000 an 
acre -- necessitated public financing. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no private developer in the world that's going to do that," he said. 
"The only way that can be done is with substantial subsidy." 
</P>
<P>
Stoddard is convinced that such ventures are necessary for areas such as 
Pittsburgh and the Mon Valley to prosper into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a sense of urgency on everyone's part that we have to get started with 
this economic transformation and prepare for the next century," he said. "We 
can't look back."

A once highly regarded Silicon Valley computer whiz has filed court documents 
alleging that he was forced to plead guilty to a scheme of stealing computer 
secrets to sell to the Soviet Union. Kevin Eric Anderson has filed a series of 
affidavits in federal court in San Jose, saying that his attorneys told him 
that he could never win acquittal and that exaggerated national security claims 
by prosecutors led prison officials in Texas to wrongly classify him as a 
convicted spy. Anderson pleaded guilty last May to conspiring to violate export 
laws and to wire fraud. He was sentenced to six years in prison. Prosecutors 
contended that the secrets he stole were proprietary information for Saxpy 
Computer Corp. of Sunnyvale and that the Saxpy computer was a supercomputer 
with military application that could help the Soviets build a "star wars" 
system. They later toned down the claim, saying it was a "near-supercomputer." 
Nothing was exchanged with the Soviets, although wiretapped conversations 
indicated that Anderson thought he could sell the material to them for millions 
of dollars.

Serious differences have emerged during talks in Warsaw between representatives 
of the Polish government and the Solidarity union on mass media access and 
local self-management, Solidarity spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz told a news 
conference. He said authorities reject the idea of allowing Solidarity free 
access to radio and television, a key demand of the trade union formed in 1980 
and banned in 1982.

David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader elected last month to the Louisiana 
House of Representatives, called the Rev. Jesse Jackson a "racist" and said 
affirmative action and minority set-aside programs should be abolished. "I 
think the racists in this city are people like Jesse Jackson," Duke said at a 
Chicago news conference after addressing the national convention of the 
right-wing Populist Party of America. Jackson declined comment on Duke's 
statements, except to say: "I don't think it's an American point of view."

West Germany's ecologist Greens party elected a new leadership at a meeting in 
Duisburg, pledging to set aside internal struggles. The previous 
radical-dominated leadership was ousted in December at a party congress, which 
intensified a struggle between "fundamentalist" and "realist" factions. The 
"fundis," as they are known, prefer direct protest action to parliamentary 
cooperation. The party's "realo" wing urges cooperation with the opposition 
Social Democratic Party to gain government office. The Greens elected as party 
spokespersons a "fundis," a "realo" and a moderate. The party won 8.3% of the 
vote in the 1987 federal election but has slipped in the polls since.

The partial merger of Detroit's two daily newspapers, the Free Press and the 
News, which was to have taken effect Monday, was blocked by Justice William J. 
Brennan Jr. until at least March 17, when the full Supreme Court meets at its 
regularly scheduled closed-door conference. Federal appeals court panels have 
upheld then-Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III's decision to allow the papers to form a 
joint operating agreement. Gannett Co., owner of the News, and Knight-Ridder, 
owner of the Free Press, say the papers are losing money. Opponents of the 
merger, calling themselves Michigan Citizens for an Independent Press, say the 
newspapers were unprofitable solely because both cut prices in an unsuccessful 
effort to force each other out of business.

Ara Dunomalyan's large, sad eyes took on a gleam and he suppressed a proud grin 
as he toddled along the corridor of Yerevan's orthopedic center, showing off 
his mobility with an artificial leg and a cane. 
</P>
<P>
The 4-year-old has triumphed over tragedy, learning to walk and smile again 
after the Dec. 7 earthquake that crushed his left leg and took the lives of his 
mother and brother. 
</P>
<P>
The innocence of childhood has allowed him to forget the horror of the day it 
rained concrete in his native town of Spitak. But the Armenian and West German 
adults who have nursed him through trauma have longer memories and more fragile 
hearts. 
</P>
<P>
Eyes welled up with tears among the circle of grown-up spectators when the 
motherless tot completed his performance for visiting foreigners by slipping a 
downy arm around the neck of a reporter who stooped to watch at his eye level, 
brushing her cheek with a kiss. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Children Forget Pain' 
</P>
<P>
"Children forget pain more easily than adults," the child's grandfather, 
Mikhail Dunomalyan, said as Ara hobbled off behind a brigade of wheelchairs 
bearing legless children through an obstacle course of nurses and technicians. 
</P>
<P>
The orthopedic center on a hill overlooking the smog-shrouded Armenian capital 
has been helped by a prosthesis workshop set up by the West German Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
Orthopedic technician Kristof Blum of Saarbruecken works in the room filled 
with child-sized rubber hands, plastic knee joints, artificial feet and 
connecting braces that slap visitors in the face with the reality and breadth 
of the suffering inflicted by the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Blum and half a dozen Armenian assistants put in long days in the laboratory 
custom-making prostheses and working through the list of amputees that 
lengthens daily as word of the clinic's work spreads through the distant, 
backward villages hit hardest by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
A despondent Spitak father approached a visiting Red Cross inspection team to 
inquire if his crippled 15-year-old daughter could be sent back with them to 
West Germany for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They Want the Best' 
</P>
<P>
"This happens every day, people wanting to send their children abroad for the 
same treatment we've worked to provide here," Blum said. "They all want what is 
best for their children and they believe that it lies far away. But what they 
fail to understand is the need for the family to be close by to help during the 
recovery period. Sometimes a mother or father is all these children have left." 
</P>
<P>
The clinic's hallways and stairwells are crowded with idle and homeless 
relatives of the patients brought here from makeshift hospitals set up in the 
earthquake zone to treat the more than 31,000 injured. 
</P>
<P>
Relief efforts in the months since the disaster have concentrated on the 
immediate tasks of medical care and food supply, and the provision of new 
housing for the estimated 100,000 left homeless will take at least two years. 
</P>
<P>
The relatives of those hospitalized spend their days caring for the patients 
and their nights in tent cities and temporary shelters. 
</P>
<P>
"Ara's ready to go home now, but he has no home to go to," said Ilya Osepyan, 
director of the 250-bed orthopedic clinic that has treated thousands of 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shelter Sought 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to arrange temporary shelter for those who have recovered at a 
children's sanatorium, but the adults have to be accommodated too," the doctor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Blum has fitted more than 30 children with artificial limbs since he arrived in 
January, as well as 50 adults. More than 300 people are awaiting prostheses, 
and the clinic expects to fulfill that need within six months. 
</P>
<P>
"The children's prostheses must be replaced as they grow, so we expect to keep 
volunteers here for at least two years, or until a local staff can be trained 
to take over the work," Blum said. 
</P>
<P>
The prosthesis center is one of several projects taken on by the West German 
Red Cross under the loosely organized disaster recovery plan being developed by 
the Soviet government. 
</P>
<P>
Worldwide donations that generated a record foreign contribution for disaster 
relief have slowed to a trickle, but International Red Cross societies and 
church organizations have collected hundreds of millions of dollars for 
long-term relief and are negotiating with Moscow and Yerevan authorities over 
how the money can best be spent. 
</P>
<P>
The West German Red Cross has built a field hospital in the city of Stepanavan, 
where 80% of the buildings were destroyed, and plans to reconstruct the village 
of Kursali, near Spitak, with the help of volunteers from the Soviet republic 
of Estonia. 
</P>
<P>
"The tears have dried and everyone will eventually be treated," Osepyan told 
the West Germans who toured the prosthesis workshop and recovery wards. "But it 
will take years to bring Armenia back to a state that could be considered 
normal."

EXTRATERRESTRIALS 'COMING BACK TO LOOK FOR ANCIENT MAYANS';

UFO MANIA SWEEPS GUATEMALA, KEEPING EYES FIXED ON THE NIGHT SKY

<TEXT>
<P>
UFO mania is sweeping this Central American nation, sending thousands of people 
each night out into the cold, dark mountains hoping for a glimpse of 
extraterrestrials. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of night sightings by upstanding citizens, not thought to be psychotic 
or prone to heavy drinking, have captured the imagination of the country of 8.7 
million people. 
</P>
<P>
Each day, local papers report sightings by doctors, lawyers, students and even 
government officials. Conversation on the streets of Guatemala City invariably 
turns to the phenomenon, with a wide range of opinions about what the strange 
objects might actually be. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the ETs (extraterrestrials) are coming back to look for the ancient 
Mayans, with whom they had contact centuries ago," said Joaquin Lopez Bonilla, 
a 20-year-old student at the capital's San Carlos University. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Looking for Tikal' 
</P>
<P>
"They are looking for Tikal, I am sure," he said, referring to the resplendent 
ancient Mayan capital, now a major archeological site about 200 miles north of 
Guatemala City. 
</P>
<P>
But there is a lot of skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
"These so-called sightings are nothing more than drug-traffickers who operate 
small craft at night," said Nario Pineda, a businessman from the town of 
Antigua, just outside the capital. "They make all kinds of strange maneuvers in 
order to avoid radar and the police," 
</P>
<P>
But for those who claim to have seen the UFOs, nothing can dissuade them from 
their belief. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw them and so did 12 of my friends, so I know I am not crazy," said Juan 
Carlos del Monte, 28. "We saw two red lights far off in the distance. They 
seemed to be playing around out in space. Then, suddenly, one began to move. 
Within 30 seconds it was flying practically over our heads. 
</P>
<P>
"It was bigger than a jumbo jet, and it did not make a sound. It was circular 
in shape, with one red light and three amber lights," Del Monte said. 
</P>
<P>
Del Monte was interviewed 40 miles northeast of Guatemala City along the 
highway that leads to the Caribbean coast. The area, near the town of El 
Progresso, has produced by far the richest number of sightings, although UFOs 
have been reported in other parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Common Time 
</P>
<P>
In El Progresso, the UFOs reportedly appear between 7:45 and 8:15 p.m. The most 
common time for their appearance is exactly at 7:56 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent night, the highway was lined with hundreds of cars, each jam-packed 
with children, dogs, grandparents and whoever else wanted to see the UFOs. 
</P>
<P>
Many people wrapped up tightly against the cold winter chill of the desolate 
mountains and milled about, comparing tales of past sightings. Dozens of 
telescopes and binoculars pointed toward the clear black sky. 
</P>
<P>
One man, using a portable electric organ, played the famous five-note tune made 
popular from the movie "Close Encounters of the Third Kind." 
</P>
<P>
"They are out there; they can hear me," he insisted. 
</P>
<P>
On that night, however, the UFOs did not appear. 
</P>
<P>
"There are too many people here now," said one disgruntled observer, who said 
he had come to El Progresso every night for a week. "All the car lights and 
cumbia music (a lilting form of 'salsa')) are scaring the Martians away." 
</P>
<P>
"It has been like this every night for the past few days," said one police 
officer, who was sent to El Progresso to make sure that the highway was not 
blocked by the crowd. "Thousands of them come up from the capital to see the 
UFOs. It's a big party." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Three Times 
</P>
<P>
"I have seen the UFOs three times," he said, adding that he did not want to 
give his name because "otherwise, they will think I am crazy down at 
headquarters." 
</P>
<P>
But the government is apparently not taking the UFO craze lightly. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't fully discount the sightings, in fact, we're a little concerned," a 
Defense Ministry spokesman said. "But there is no proof of anything," 
</P>
<P>
He said that a number of military and police agencies were investigating the 
reports and that the agencies were "keeping an eye out for the UFOs ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
"We have four observation posts set up around El Progresso," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even Interior Minister Roberto Valle Valdizan was not immune to UFO mania. One 
night recently, he and an entourage of aides spent several hours near El 
Progresso, heads turned skyward. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not see a thing," the minister told reporters the next day. "I am very 
disappointed, but I will be back again," 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the craze continues. 
</P>
<P>
Local merchants are running radio ads claiming that ETs came to Guatemala to 
buy their products, while T-shirts, banners and graffiti cry out: "Welcome to 
Central America UFOs." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arrive Late 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting to be a bit much. We are going to suffer if this continues," said 
one bank manager in Guatemala City, adding that several of his employees "have 
been coming in late in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
"They stay out in El Progresso until very late and cannot get up in time the 
next day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But as long as the sightings continue, Guatemalans will keep looking skyward at 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most exciting thing that has happened here in years," Del Monte 
said. "It is better than the Pope's visit in 1985."

WILL TRIBES BE OVERRUN?;

<P>
GLUT OF FOREIGN TREKKERS SPARKS FEAR AMONG THAIS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Armed with cash and cameras, foreign trekkers by the thousands are scouring the 
hills of northern Thailand for unspoiled tribal people, turning the region into 
"a human zoo," critics say. 
</P>
<P>
Thai officials, Christian missionaries and others interviewed say these 
increasingly popular treks by Western Europeans, Americans and Australians are 
hastening the erosion of traditional culture among 500,000 tribal people 
already reeling under rapid modernization. 
</P>
<P>
Villagers are selling their colorful costumes, jewelry and other heirlooms or 
exchanging them for jeans and other Western goods offered by trekkers. And 
intruding brusquely into village life are some Westerners who, as former tour 
operator Bill Young recalls, "run around with their breasts hanging out." 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is free now. Their traditional hospitality has been corrupted," 
American missionary David Morse says. "Before they would offer food and lodging 
to strangers. Now they no longer accept people for who they are. They have 
become hardened, less open." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
100,000 Trekkers in '88 
</P>
<P>
According to the government's tourist authority, tribal trekking has grown from 
a handful of hikers in the 1970s to more than 100,000 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Most sign up with tour companies in this major northern Thai city, then make 
their way by jeep, bamboo raft, elephant, motorcycle or foot to the hill 
villages of the Akha, Karen, Hmong, Lisu, Lahu and other tribes. 
</P>
<P>
The trekking companies capitalize on the region's natural beauty and the lure 
of the exotic and notorious -- the area is part of the so-called Golden 
Triangle of opium fields and warlord armies. 
</P>
<P>
"Padaung hill tribes now available," reads one typical advertisement, which has 
prompted critics to charge that the tribal people are being marketed like 
animals on a safari or in a zoo. 
</P>
<P>
Young, a longtime American resident of northern Thailand, says trekking 
agencies vary greatly. 
</P>
<P>
Some, he says, educate clients about local cultures, while others may offer an 
"opium experience" and provide opportunities for "authentic" photographs by 
getting tribesmen to smoke their opium pipes or engage in courtship rituals. 
</P>
<P>
Some trekkers have died of drug overdoses. Violence and robbery against 
tourists -- once unheard of -- are on the rise as cultures clash and cash is 
haphazardly injected into primitive economies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Controls Over Agencies 
</P>
<P>
Suppakit Apasil, director of the government's tourism office in Chiang Mai, 
says part of the trouble stems from lack of controls over the mushrooming 
agencies and the trekking industry, which brings $5 million annually to the 
city.

TOURISTS RECRUITED TO PRESERVE WILD DOGS 
</P>

<P>
KRUGER NATIONAL PARK, South Africa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists at Kruger National Park are recruiting tourists to help them track, 
count and conserve the African wild dog, the most endangered large carnivore on 
the continent. 
</P>
<P>
The big-eared dogs have intricately patterned coats, each one distinct enough 
so individual animals can be identified from photographs. Once scientists know 
how many wild dogs there are and how they move, they will begin drawing up 
conservation plans. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa's National Parks Board and the private Endangered Wildlife Trust 
have started a contest to get tourists to take pictures of the animals and send 
the prints in with information on location, pack size and number of young. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 photographs have been entered in the contest, which began in 
January and runs through July. 
</P>
<P>
The first prize is a free trip to a South African national park and the 
runner-up prizes are photo equipment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Scared of Vehicles' 
</P>
<P>
"We could drive through the park for a month and never see one wild dog, but 
probably every day someone somewhere in the park sees them. They stay close to 
the road and they are not scared of vehicles," said Gus Mills, head of predator 
research at the park. 
</P>
<P>
He said he believes there are about 300 in the park, the biggest group in 
Africa. Others are in Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia and parts of East Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"They move long distances and seem sometimes to go out of the park. When that 
happens, they get into trouble," said Mills. 
</P>
<P>
Since wild dog packs hunt by day and don't fear humans, they are easy targets 
for farmers protecting their livestock. Mills said a farmer whose land borders 
the park recently shot 20 dogs. 
</P>
<P>
"People have an exaggerated hatred for wild dogs; it's somewhat like the way 
the wolf is regarded in America," Mills said.

More than 117,000 gallons of oil gushed from the tank and fuel lines of a 
ruptured tanker that ran aground on a coral reef and dark goo from a drifting 
1-mile-long slick washed onto a remote beach Friday, the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
The tanker drifted onto a coral reef about 1,000 yards southwest of Barbers 
Point lighthouse Thursday. The famous beaches of Waikiki are 15 miles east of 
Barbers Point on the south shore of the island. 
</P>
<P>
There were no reported injuries to the 24 crewmen aboard the tanker. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard spokesman Keith Spangler said, "We have the possibility of a major 
pollution incident," but Coast Guard official Dennis Hubbard of the Marine 
Safety Office said the ship appeared to be in no immediate danger of sinking or 
losing its cargo of 90,000 barrels of crude oil.

DRINKING DEATH STIRS MANY FRATS TO CLOSE BARS AND BRING BACK ADVISERS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 14 newly pinned college fraternity pledges, roused by the members' speeches 
and their own desire to belong, were led downstairs into the darkened Lambda 
Chi Alpha basement and lined up in front of the bar. 
</P>
<P>
On went the lights, revealing the final stage of the pinning night. There sat 
200 "kamikazes," a potent vodka concoction. 
</P>
<P>
They drank. 
</P>
<P>
James Callahan of North Bergen drank until he dropped dead. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old's alcohol death last winter at Rutgers University was one of a 
string of scandals at fraternity houses around the country that have brought 
more pressure for reforms of the Greek-letter brotherhoods. 
</P>
<P>
With their futures at stake, fraternities are responding. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bars Being Closed 
</P>
<P>
Bars in many fraternity houses are being closed and advisers are returning. And 
the National Interfraternity Conference is considering a total ban on pledging. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy to change the culture, but until we do I think there are going 
to be very bad days ahead for fraternities," said John Creedon, a Rutgers 
assistant provost. Since Callahan's death, Creedon has led the push for 
fraternity reforms at Rutgers. 
</P>
<P>
"Fraternities are under fire as never before," said Eileen Stevens, a national 
anti-hazing activist. She has traveled the country since her son died 10 years 
ago after drinking too much during a hazing at Alfred University in upstate New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
"Their very future is in jeopardy," Stevens said. "I think we've come to a 
point where the people who supervise them realize the problems are enormous, 
and they're just not sure what to do about it." 
</P>
<P>
The problems boil down to two hard-dying traditions -- drinking and hazing. 
</P>
<P>
Critics call fraternities an anachronism. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Futile Struggle' 
</P>
<P>
"Fraternities have been engaged, like the brontosaurus, in a futile struggle 
against a changed climate," Earl Smith, dean at Colby College, wrote last year 
in the Chronicle of Higher Education. Fraternities have been banned at Colby 
since 1984, when administrators decided that they no longer fit in at the 
college in Waterville, Me. 
</P>
<P>
Fraternity leaders say the scandals are relatively few, that elitism charges 
are unfounded and that the positives such as friendship, leadership development 
and community service far outweigh any negatives. 
</P>
<P>
But over the last two years, defenders of the fraternity system have winced at 
a series of incidents. In addition to the Rutgers death: 
</P>
<P>
* Four members of the University of Alabama chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, the 
largest national fraternity, were arrested on charges of selling cocaine. They 
were accused of making some of the drug deals out of the stately chapter house. 
</P>
<P>
* At the University of Lowell in Massachusetts, six fraternity members were 
charged under the state's tough anti-hazing law over a stunt that sent a pledge 
to the hospital with a body temperature of 109. The members had bundled the 
victim in a sleeping bag and turned on heaters nearby. 
</P>
<P>
* A former University of Delaware student claimed in a lawsuit that someone 
dumped caustic oven cleaner over his head during a fraternity "Hell Night." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Death Inspires Bills 
</P>
<P>
But nothing stirred an outcry like Callahan's death at Rutgers. It inspired 
nearly a dozen bills in the New Jersey Legislature and is cited by fraternity 
critics nationally. 
</P>
<P>
"That probably had more impact on us than any other hazing incident," said 
Jonathan Brant, director of the National Interfraternity Conference. 
</P>
<P>
The reprisals against Lambda Chi Alpha were swift and harsh. The Rutgers 
chapter was disbanded and the house doors slammed shut. 
</P>
<P>
The 29 other fraternities were ordered to pull out their basement bars, which 
had become standard equipment at Rutgers fraternities, and make other reforms. 
</P>
<P>
It could have been worse. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, more than a dozen colleges have banned Greek-letter 
organizations. Besides Colby, fraternities are passe at Amherst College and the 
University of Lowell, both in Massachusetts, and Franklin &amp; Marshall 
College in Lancaster, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Underage Drinking Clubs' 
</P>
<P>
At the Pennsylvania college, "the trustees felt the fraternities had been 
reduced in many ways to underage drinking clubs," said college spokeswoman 
Patti Lawson. 
</P>
<P>
The mounting pressure against fraternities threatens what has been a steadily 
rising membership. 
</P>
<P>
Undergraduate fraternity membership has climbed to 400,000, according to the 
interfraternity conference. That's more than double the 1970 figures and a 
170,000 increase since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Greek system's golden age of the 1950s, this heyday has come in a 
relatively unsupervised environment, campus administrators note. Gone are the 
housemothers, strict rules and other formalities that once characterized 
fraternity life. 
</P>
<P>
But some college administrations are starting to reintroduce the supervision. 
Many fraternity chapters have resisted, but some are starting to respond. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Live-in Advisers at USC 
</P>
<P>
Resident advisers have moved into chapter houses on USC's Fraternity Row. 
Fraternities have gone completely dry at Indiana University, home to one of the 
strongest Greek systems in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The fraternities' national magazines abound with denunciations of alcohol 
abuse, sexism and racism. 
</P>
<P>
A recent edition of Alpha Tau Omega's publication chronicles that fraternity's 
efforts to halt a national liquor promotion geared to male college students. 
</P>
<P>
The governing body of Zeta Beta Tau voted in September to end pledging, an idea 
being studied by the national Greek council. 
</P>
<P>
Callahan's death came a few days after more than 40 Princeton students were 
treated for alcohol poisoning following a drinking binge at two private social 
clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen Lambda Chi Alpha members were charged with aggravated hazing in 
Callahan's death. They have yet to come to trial, but a conviction would carry 
a maximum penalty of 18 months in jail and a $7,500 fine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consensus on Drinking 
</P>
<P>
"I've had calls from all across the country," said James Meisel, a Hackensack 
lawyer who is representing Callahan's mother. "Among the people I've talked to 
-- university people, crusader groups -- there's a consensus that as a general 
matter drinking is way out of hand on college campuses." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Discenza, a lawyer for Lambda Chi's Board of Trustees, acknowledges that 
there was "peer pressure" for the pledges to drink. But Discenza contends that 
nobody was forced. 
</P>
<P>
He said Callahan's own reckless behavior was to blame for his death, which an 
autopsy attributed to 23 ounces of alcohol and a .434% blood alcohol content -- 
more than four times the legal limit. 
</P>
<P>
"This one isolated incident said nothing," said Discenza, an alumnus of the 
Rutgers Lambda Chi Alpha chapter. "It said if someone really wants to drink a 
lot they can. It could have happened just as easily in my basement." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fights Rutgers Proposal 
</P>
<P>
Michael Steinbruck, a Delta Phi member, is leading a fight against the Rutgers 
administration's latest proposal for reform -- a requirement that each chapter 
have an adult, live-in adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbruck, 23, has a scrapbook full of press clippings about his chapter's 
work to raise money for New Brunswick homeless shelters and other causes. He 
believes the university has ignored the good works of fraternities and acted in 
a reactionary fashion to Callahan's death. 
</P>
<P>
"People are so fed up with constantly being on the defensive about hazing, 
they're willing to try lots of different plans if they feel they have a 
reasonable chance of succeeding," said Patrick Brown, a national fraternity 
official. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would End Irresponsibility 
</P>
<P>
The goal, Brown said, is to reinforce the founding purposes of friendship and 
scholarship and eliminate "the basic irresponsibility, whether it is alcohol 
abuse, hazing, poor scholarship. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Fraternity can be a magnificent educational movement if it's appropriately 
directed. I'm convinced we're taking it in the direction it has to go if we're 
to survive."

SEATTLE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once a little city with clean, if rainy, skies and clear mountain views, 
fast-growing Seattle has become a metropolis with the usual smog and traffic 
jams. Some people are starting to protest. 
</P>
<P>
A citizens group turned in 18,000 signatures on an initiative to limit the 
height and density of downtown buildings, and debate is gearing up before a 
vote on May 16. 
</P>
<P>
The building boom is easy to see, and much of it has occurred in the last 
decade. Three skyscrapers are under construction, and permit applications for 
three more were submitted before a recently imposed six-month moratorium on 
downtown growth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Buildings Top 50 Stories 
</P>
<P>
The 55-story Washington Mutual Tower was completed last year, bumping the 
50-story 1001 Fourth Avenue Plaza to third tallest. No. 1 is the West Coast's 
tallest building, the 76-story black-glass Columbia Seafirst Center built in 
1985, before downtown zoning went into effect. A dozen office towers are 30 
stories or more, and all but three were opened in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The thousands of workers in these buildings, plus tourists and shoppers, make 
downtown Seattle a lively place. 
</P>
<P>
Fishmongers, farmers' stalls, crafts booths and restaurants compete 
shoulder-to-shoulder at the historic, hectic Pike Place Market. 
</P>
<P>
Redevelopment is continuing at the downtown waterfront. And the downtown retail 
core, with major flagship department stores and a variety of small businesses, 
recently settled one 30-year-old land-use debate with the opening of Westlake 
Center, a new mall of expensive shops and a 24-story office tower. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concern for Pollution 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the Citizens Alternative Plan to Downtown Development, or CAP, 
say overdevelopment in downtown will mean more pollution as more people commute 
by car and more box-like apartment buildings replace single-family houses and 
dilute the flavor of old city neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
CAP wants to limit building height to about 40 stories in the office district. 
New office floor space would be limited to 500,000 square feet a year for the 
next five years and 1 million square feet a year from 1995 through 1999. After 
that, the ceiling would be lifted unless re-imposed by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, nearly 6 million square feet of downtown office space is newly 
completed, under construction or has received city permits, said Virginia 
Galle, a City Council member and CAP supporter. 
</P>
<P>
At the present rate of growth, in 10 years about 67,000 new office workers are 
expected to occupy 52,000 new households and make 29,000 more car trips daily 
into downtown, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Formula for Size 
</P>
<P>
There is no height limit under the city's current zoning plan. A building's 
size is worked out according to a formula based on the size of the site, with 
extra height allowed in exchange for such amenities as plazas, retail space and 
day-care centers. 
</P>
<P>
CAP supporters insist that they want growth, but not at a high cost to the 
environment and the neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not anti-growth in the traditional sense," says Patrick Strosahl, a 
jeweler and president of Vision Seattle, which supports CAP. "We're really much 
more into shaping growth so that it produces and accentuates the livability of 
the city." 
</P>
<P>
Some participants in the growth debate argue that the city needs controls that 
are more lenient than the CAP initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Charles Royer presented a plan of his own that would limit office towers 
to about 50 stories. It would stiffen the zoning code, but not as much as CAP 
would. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Encourage Height 
</P>
<P>
Royer also wants to adjust the bonus system used to allow developers to build 
higher. His plan would shift the emphasis of the bonuses from street-level 
amenities to housing, human services and open space. 
</P>
<P>
The Downtown Seattle Assn., a group of developers and business executives, 
contends that the 1985 zoning law is strict enough. 
</P>
<P>
John Gilmore, president of the association, says downtown growth makes more 
sense than spreading development into neighborhoods and suburbs. A downtown 
provides a focal point for a rapid-transit system, something Seattle needs, he 
said. And Seattle must grow, he contended. "We're having children like every 
other part of the country, and there's got to be jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Folke Nyberg, a professor of urban planning and architecture at the University 
of Washington, agreed that Seattle's location on the Pacific Rim means that it 
will grow, but disagreed that concentrated downtown growth is good. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Physical Constraints' 
</P>
<P>
Seattle has an "hourglass" figure, squeezed between Puget Sound and Lake 
Washington, he said. "So there are some very limited physical constraints that 
make it imperative that we have an effective transportation solution before we 
allow growth to happen, and this was not done." 
</P>
<P>
A better way to grow, Nyberg said, would be in decentralized clusters 
throughout the region. People in these smaller cities would live near their 
jobs and go to downtown Seattle mainly for conventions and cultural events. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, unplanned growth can be seen in declining air quality, traffic 
congestion and more homelessness caused by a lack of affordable housing, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle, which "has been a very livable city," he said, failed to learn from 
other cities' mistakes. Asked why, he replied: "It's all greed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prefers Hearings 
</P>
<P>
Gilmore, of the Downtown Seattle Assn., said that the city's 1985 downtown 
zoning was the product of four years of debate and that any changes should be 
made through more hearings and City Council votes. The American Institute of 
Architects' local chapter agrees. 
</P>
<P>
CAP supporters, however, say their plan is reasonable and timely. 
</P>
<P>
According to Strosahl, San Francisco needed to enact stiffer downtown limits in 
1986 because it waited too long, until the cost of housing went way up and the 
character of the city changed. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco voters approved the limits after a building spree in which 25 
million square feet of office space was added between 1979 and 1984. The 
high-rises nearly blocked out all the sun in San Francisco's financial 
district. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco's voter-approved plan limits new office space to 475,000 square 
feet for several years for a city with a population of 690,000. That compares 
to CAP's limits of 500,000 square feet for five years and 1 million square feet 
for the next five in a city of 490,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Questions Motives 
</P>
<P>
Gilmore suggests that people who signed CAP did not really want to limit growth 
but were just annoyed with traffic disruption downtown caused by construction 
of a downtown bus tunnel and a state convention center. The initiative text was 
long and complicated, and people probably did not read it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the petition had just 329 more signatures than it needed. 
</P>
<P>
Strosahl thinks voters will pass the initiative, but he expects a highly 
financed campaign against it.

Zbigniew Krawiec swore that he had just been drinking pickle juice when he was 
pulled over for drunk driving, but a jury decided he was pickled and convicted 
him anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Krawiec, a Polish immigrant, said his favorite beverage is pickle juice. It's a 
Polish custom, he told jurors Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
To prove his point, defense attorney Jim Kane introduced a jar of dill pickles 
and wanted Krawiec to take a mouthful on the witness stand to prove he loves 
the stuff. 
</P>
<P>
But deputy prosecutor Steven Nash objected, and Judge Charles Dorn upheld the 
objection. 
</P>
<P>
"Have I ever seen a 'pickle juice defense' before this? No," said Dorn, who has 
tried hundreds of drunk-driving cases. 
</P>
<P>
Washington State Trooper Dan Derrick testified that he pulled Krawiec over 
after spotting him driving with his lights off. Derrick said Krawiec failed a 
field sobriety test and refused to take a breath test. 
</P>
<P>
Derrick and two jailers testified that the defendant's breath smelled of 
alcohol, not pickles. 
</P>
<P>
Dorn fined Krawiec $400 and ordered him to serve three days in jail. Kane is 
expected to appeal.

<P>
Chinese yuppies who never selected a song from a jukebox are discovering the 
American '50s with a zeal that has made ballroom dancing the hottest craze in 
town. 
</P>
<P>
Sipping malteds at a soda fountain while Elvis Presley croons and examining 
fenders from an era when a teen with a Thunderbird was king are new pastimes 
for workaholic Singaporeans. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything seemed so much simpler then," said Lester Chue, a busy real estate 
agent who finds time each day for a "Blue Hawaii Hamburger" or "Love Me Tender 
Steak" at Yesterday's, the newest hot spot overflowing with nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deprived as Teens 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Americans remembering their youth with cars and cash, Southeast Asian 
adults who were teens during that bygone era recall lining up for noodles at 
hawker stands and dreams of bicycles for transport. 
</P>
<P>
Confined to gramophones and a family radio in the aftermath of World War II 
with Singapore part of Malaysia under British colonial rule, Jenny Ling 
recalled her parents exhorting her to switch off such enticers as Jerry Lee 
Lewis blasting "Great Balls of Fire." 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have the cars and other trappings enjoyed by American kids," said 
Ling, now a middle-aged mother. "But we all loved rock 'n' roll, and I still 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Zack Harris, enterprising assistant manager at Yesterday's, recreates the '50s 
for those too young to remember, adults old enough to cherish their own 
memories and both generations intrigued by such American artifacts as Wurlitzer 
jukeboxes, Remington typewriters, gum ball machines and vintage pumps 
advertising gasoline for 33 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
With the walls plastered with the fenders of the most-coveted cars and a band 
sporting pompadours belting out the hits of Fats Domino, Bill Haley and the 
Comets, the Everly Brothers, Chuck Berry, the Four Seasons, Ricky Nelson, Buddy 
Holly and others who became overnight sensations, even Harris is amazed at the 
instant success. 
</P>
<P>
"We never thought we'd be selling more milkshakes than liquor," he said. "But 
this is a place where anyone caught up in the hectic pace of six-day weeks can 
slow down, have fun and feel good." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oldies, New Releases Mixed 
</P>
<P>
Disc jockeys spin oldies as regularly as latest releases from Michael Jackson, 
Madonna and Bruce Springsteen. Video stores sell out discs and tapes of one-hit 
or few-hit wonders as fast as they are restocked. 
</P>
<P>
It is a rare shopping center that is not blaring the sound track from "La 
Bamba," the movie about '50s singer Ritchie Valens who was killed in a plane 
crash. The film played to packed houses for months. 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated beauticians eager to create elegant hairdos complain over the 
popularity of ponytails. Dance teachers are overwhelmed by demand for ballroom 
dancing lessons, particularly the jitterbug and acrobatic rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
Young professionals view ballroom dancing as a social skill, singles seeking 
romance cherish hopes of an attractive partner, and the older set kept away 
from discos by the feverish pace find rhythms they can enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started lessons I thought I'd never make it," said bank vice president 
K. W. Teh, 52, as he guided his 20-year-old daughter through the cha-cha. "Now 
it's clear there is no age limitation on dancing." 
</P>
<P>
Dance schools have skyrocketed, with eight catering to 14,000 students like Lee 
Wye Choo, a businesswoman who said she has spent "the equivalent of a one-carat 
diamond ring" on lessons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Intrigued by Glamour 
</P>
<P>
Lee, 23, said she is intrigued by the glamour, with men in polished black 
dancing shoes twirling partners in flared skirts in disciplined but graceful 
movements. 
</P>
<P>
Other zealots said they have given up all other hobbies to finance dancing 
lessons. Soo Lee, a transport company executive director, said she has 
abandoned gardening and scuba diving to perfect the jitterbug, rock 'n' roll 
and jive she loves best. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Low, a dance teacher for 32 years, said the renewed ardor is back to 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
"People thought that if they could get onto the disco floor and shake their 
bodies they would be all right, but that's all dying now and discos are 
changing," Low said. "The new ones are capitalizing on ballroom dancing."

STATE TO TEST RADON LEVELS IN VENTURA, L.A. COUNTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State health officials this month will mail letters to about 5,000 residents of 
Ventura and Los Angeles counties asking them to participate in a study to 
determine the extent of radon, a radioactive gas that can cause lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,000 households will be chosen for the survey, which will encompass 
Ventura County and adjoining areas of Los Angeles County, including Agoura, 
Pacific Palisades, Westwood, Hollywood and much of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth W. Kizer, director of the state Department of Health Services, ordered 
the study in October after learning the results of a yearlong survey by The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
The Times study found that the chances of exceeding recommended radon limits 
were higher than the Southern California average in a fast-growing southeastern 
Ventura County area that includes Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks and Moorpark. 
While Kizer called the Ventura County results only "mildly elevated" and 
relatively low in comparison to other U.S. areas, he ordered a more 
comprehensive study. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Survey Delayed 
</P>
<P>
The $40,000 survey was to begin last fall but was delayed because of 
difficulties in finding funding, said Steven Hayward, manager of the state 
Department of Health Services' Indoor Air Quality Program. Funds were trimmed 
from other department programs to pay for the study, he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 800 homes in Ventura County will begin the yearlong test in June, Hayward 
said, along with 200 homes in adjoining areas in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Hayward said residents' names were randomly chosen from property tax rolls in 
Ventura County and from Department of Motor Vehicles records in Los Angeles 
County. State health officials will choose a geographically representative 
sample of 1,000 homes from the responses they receive and mail testing devices 
to residents to install, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The more people that respond, the better our sample will be," Hayward said. 
"But people shouldn't just call in to volunteer because we're only using homes 
that have been randomly chosen." 
</P>
<P>
Letters to be mailed to the 5,000 residents will include a two-page fact sheet 
on radon and a postage-paid response. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3-Month Study 
</P>
<P>
About 200 of the 1,000 homes will receive a second device that will monitor 
radon levels for three months. This will give state health officials an early 
sense of the geographic distribution of any high radon levels, Hayward said. 
</P>
<P>
But the longer testing period of a year is necessary because radon levels 
fluctuate seasonally, with higher levels often found in the winter when homes 
tend to be kept sealed from the cold, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The state's survey comes at a time of growing national concern about the health 
threat posed by radon. Radon, which is produced by the natural decay of 
uranium, is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In September, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency joined the Surgeon 
General in issuing an unprecedented national health advisory urging virtually 
all homeowners nationwide to test their homes for the gas, which is found in 
soils throughout the world. Kizer pointed out that state testing is under way 
and said that it is too early for his department to recommend that everyone 
test. 
</P>
<P>
Because of slight differences in air pressure inside the house and outdoors, 
radon gas can be drawn into the house much like smoke is drawn up a fireplace 
chimney. The gas enters the house through cracks in concrete slab foundations, 
openings around plumbing and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Locations Confidential 
</P>
<P>
The exact location of the 1,000 homes and the identity of residents will be 
confidential, Hayward said. But California law requires home sellers to 
disclose to potential buyers anything they know that affects the habitability 
or marketability of the property. However, Hayward said, homes with radon 
readings above the EPA's recommended limit of 4 picocuries per liter of air 
could be modified for "a few hundred to a couple of thousand dollars" to reduce 
the gas to safe levels. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the study, health officials from Los Angeles and Ventura counties will 
visit the homes to make sure that the devices are installed properly, Hayward 
said. The detectors are supposed to be placed in a heavily used room on the 
ground floor or the lowest occupied floor, he said. Participants will be asked 
to mail back the devices at the end of the study, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The survey will involve three times as many homes as the state is already 
monitoring for radon throughout California. The current survey of 360 homes is 
being conducted by the Department of Health Services and the state Air 
Resources Board. 
</P>
<P>
In its study last year, The Times tested 436 residences in a Southern 
California region that includes Los Angeles and Orange counties and parts of 
Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RADON TESTING AREAS 
</P>
<P>
* Ventura Co.: 800 homes selected from throughout the entire county. 
</P>
<P>
* Los Angeles Co.: 200 homes selected from within the communities of Agoura 
Hills, Bel-Air, Beverly Hills, Brentwood, Canoga Park, Chatsworth, Encino, 
Hollywood, Mission Hills, Newhall, Pacific Palisades, Saugus, Sherman Oaks, 
Tarzana, Topanga, Valencia, Westwood and Woodland Hills.

'FLEMING IS NOT A BAD SCHOOL. WE'VE JUST HAD BAD LUCK.';

<P>
TRAUMATIZED SCHOOL ON THE MEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though only a few miles from some tough Los Angeles neighborhoods where crime, 
gangs and other big-city problems are common, Fleming Junior High in Lomita is 
the kind of place where nothing ever happened. 
</P>
<P>
But in the last 15 months, students have been traumatized by a rape and two 
shootings -- one student was killed, another wounded -- as well as the 
unexpected death of their principal. Fleming administrators cannot recall as 
turbulent a period in the school's 32-year history. 
</P>
<P>
The litany of tragic events began in November, 1987, with a ninth-grade "ditch" 
party, when about 25 teen-agers -- many of them older students from other 
schools -- cut classes and went to the home of a Fleming student while his 
parents were away. The alcohol-fueled party ended with the gang rape of a 
15-year-old female Fleming student. Three high school students were charged 
with rape or attempted rape, and two Fleming students were arrested on 
suspicion of rape but were not charged. The victim eventually transferred to 
another school. 
</P>
<P>
Last October, 15-year-old Fleming student Cesar Chavez was shot to death in a 
gang-related drive-by shooting in Compton. Although the incident occurred 
off-campus, students were devastated by the death of their classmate. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on Feb. 23, Adam Mendoza, a ninth-grade student and reputed gang member, 
was shot and injured on campus. Police said the 16-year-old student flashed 
gang hand signs at passengers in a passing car, who fired at least five shots 
at Mendoza, striking him once in the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
The Mendoza shooting happened only just days after students and faculty were 
shocked by the sudden loss of the school's principal, Patrick Cragin. The lanky 
6-foot, 11-inch administrator died at age 48 of a heart attack he suffered 
while watching his daughter play in a volleyball game in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
School administrators and faculty members, including counselors and the staff 
psychologist, have rallied to help Fleming's 1,350 students cope with the 
crises. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We've Just Had Bad Luck' 
</P>
<P>
"It's like so much to bear all in one year," said ninth-grader Vashia Rhone, 
14. "Fleming is not a bad school. We've just had bad luck." 
</P>
<P>
The incidents, in particular the sudden deaths of Cragin and Chavez, left 
students shocked and disbelieving, administrators said. 
</P>
<P>
On the day of Chavez's funeral, dozens of students got permission to leave 
campus and attend the funeral Mass across the street at St. Margaret Mary 
Catholic Church. Many students donated money to help his family pay funeral 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Some students at first refused to accept the principal's death, said Assistant 
Principal Don Wilson. "There was almost disbelief that he was here that Friday 
and was gone that Tuesday," he said. "A student came up to me and said he 
didn't believe it. He said, 'I know you're joking.' " 
</P>
<P>
After Cragin's death, "students were very sad," said Assistant Principal 
Constance Rupert. "They still come into the office and ask if he's really 
dead." 
</P>
<P>
"It was like it wasn't real," said ninth-grader Jennifer Skoda. 
</P>
<P>
The concept of death "really isn't real" for many junior high-age students, but 
students are gradually coming to accept it, said school psychologist Shamim 
Ibrahim, who counseled some students after the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
After the shooting last month, "we had some boys and girls who were crying," 
Ibrahim said. "Mostly the students were concerned for his (Mendoza's) safety, 
whether he lived, whether he was seriously injured." 
</P>
<P>
Some students fear the violence they have heard about in other areas is 
encroaching on Lomita, and on their school. 
</P>
<P>
"It was shocking," said Ivy Walker, 13, "because it's the kind of thing that 
happens at other schools." 
</P>
<P>
"It's just spreading," said student body President Craig Valenzuela, 15. "I 
don't think you're afraid until it happens right in front of you." 
</P>
<P>
Parent Jeff Baker, president of the School-Community Advisory Council, said 
most parents are aware that some Fleming students are gang members. 
</P>
<P>
Most Fleming students come from feeder schools in Lomita, Harbor City and 
Torrance, including Eshelman Avenue Elementary in Lomita, Harbor City 
Elementary School and Halldale Avenue Elementary and Meyler Street Elementary, 
both in Torrance, Fleming officials said. 
</P>
<P>
After last month's on-campus shooting, parent concern for their children's 
safety has increased, said Baker, who graduated from Fleming in 1971 and has a 
son in the seventh grade there. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby gang activity "does spill over, although the immediate area around the 
school is basically a quiet neighborhood," Baker said. The potential for 
violence, he said, "is one of those things a lot of Fleming parents didn't put 
a lot of thought into until it happened." 
</P>
<P>
Although the school does not have an on-campus guard, Fleming parents may 
request such security in light of last month's shooting, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel the incident couldn't have been prevented by having campus security, 
but it could have aided in apprehending someone faster," Baker said. Los 
Angeles Unified School District police arrested a reputed gang member the day 
of the shooting on suspicion of attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Principal 
</P>
<P>
Fleming's new principal is James Marshall, formerly assistant principal in 
charge of discipline and security at Steven White Junior High in Carson. 
</P>
<P>
During an interview on his first day at Fleming last Thursday, Marshall and 
other administrators discussed security changes at the school. One new rule 
prohibits students from lingering on Fleming's front lawn before and after 
school, administrators said. 
</P>
<P>
Students also are no longer allowed near the playground fence during physical 
education. That is where gang hand signs were exchanged last week between 
students on campus and passengers in a black car from which the shots were 
later fired at Mendoza. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators will increase campus patrols, using portable radios, and they 
will continue to enforce dress codes prohibiting gang clothing and colors, 
Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our schools are safe and we'll take whatever measures necessary to keep them 
that way," Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
At least one student concerned about his safety has requested a transfer. Such 
requests will be handled "on a case-by-case basis," Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
But other students said they are not fearful and hope the trauma is over. 
</P>
<P>
The school's flag had been flown at half-staff since Cragin's death. When 
students arrived at school on Monday "the flag was at full mast again," said 
Vashia Rhone. "It was like a cloud had lifted."

A MESSAGE WITH A BEAT; 
</P>
<P>
DRUMMING UP INTEREST IN INSTRUMENT'S 'ROOTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Tootie Heath has been around. 
</P>
<P>
His beat has filled smoky jazz lounges and recording studios in New York, Los 
Angeles, Barcelona, Copenhagen. He has studied with master drummers of Ghana, 
Nigeria and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
At 54, Albert (Tootie) Heath is one of the most respected drummers in jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Last week this wandering wise man came to Inglewood High School to share the 
considerable culture and history of the drum. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see how you can play the drums and not be interested in the history of 
the music," he said in an interview. Heath has a classic jazz voice -- he talks 
in a gentle rush of words. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to go back to what went on before New Orleans, what went on before 
slavery, back to the cradle of civilization. If you have an interest in the 
history and culture of the drum, sooner or later you go to Africa. I've been 
traveling around the world doing research on the drum. . . . I like to share it 
with young people." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Visits Schools 
</P>
<P>
For the past five years, Heath has spread his message at Los Angeles-area 
schools. He says teaching is a logical step for a lifelong student of jazz who 
grew up in a musical household where it was not unusual for Charlie Parker to 
drop by. 
</P>
<P>
The name Tootie, by the way, results from a casual christening by a grandfather 
in the late 1930s. Heath suspects it has something to do with tutti-frutti ice 
cream. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad I wasn't born in the '80s. My name would be Haagen-Dazs or Frusen 
Gladje," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Heath has played in groups with his brothers -- saxophonist Jimmy Heath and 
bassist Percy Heath -- and with legendary artists including John Coltrane, 
Dexter Gordon and Nat (Cannonball) Adderly. After a career that has included 
long stints in Europe -- typical of so many jazz musicians -- he lives in 
Altadena and divides his time between performing and teaching. 
</P>
<P>
The Senegalese drum he brought to the gym at Inglewood High School last week is 
called a djimbe, part of a drum collection Heath has gathered during trips 
around the world. In a brief presentation culminating Black History Month 
activities at the school, Heath used the djimbe to analyze different rhythms 
and playing styles, tracing them from their African roots through slavery, jazz 
and contemporary music. 
</P>
<P>
The 2,000 students in the audience appeared to enjoy themselves. Nonetheless, 
these are teen-agers whose musical pantheon does not often include be-bop 
drummers, no matter how renowned or deserving. Heath said that doesn't bother 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids that are 18, 17, 16 years old, they're interested in the music that's 
going on today. I just want to show the connections. We have economic reasons 
to categorize music, but I don't separate jazz from Michael Jackson, Little 
Richard -- they all have elements of the same thing. It's all connected." 
</P>
<P>
After many lean years, Heath said, the '80s have been a generally good decade 
for jazz. Young purists like New Orleans trumpeter Wynton Marsalis have become 
millionaires. Movies like " 'Round Midnight" and last year's "Bird" indicate 
the spreading commercial presence of a musical form that some have complained 
is more popular overseas than in its native land. 
</P>
<P>
That is a myth, says Heath, who lived and performed in Europe in the late '60s 
and early '70s. 
</P>
<P>
"Europeans may have a broader range of music they like," he said, but "I've 
always been a person that says the greatest jazz audiences are here in this 
country." 
</P>
<P>
In this country, "Bird," the dark cinematic portrait of sax genius Charlie 
Parker directed by Clint Eastwood, is the most prominent recent attempt to pay 
homage to jazz. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Effect of Movies 
</P>
<P>
Heath, who knows musicians who worked on the movie, appreciates the effort. But 
he's less than enthusiastic about the result. He feels Hollywood commercial 
priorities twisted the movie's focus, overemphasizing Parker's drug problems, 
for example. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew Charlie Parker," Heath said. "He was a gentleman, a wonderful man. I'm 
not interested in Clint Eastwood's version of Charlie Parker. I'm not 
interested in Chan Parker's (Parker's widow's) version." 
</P>
<P>
Heath's continuing passion for his music fits an artist who in 1968 took on the 
Nigerian name Kuumba, which means "creativity." He said he is now studying the 
Yoruba culture and music of Nigeria with a master drummer from that country. 
</P>
<P>
So the teacher is still a student. The man who performed at Inglewood High 
School retains the spirit of 40-odd years ago, when 12-year-old Tootie Heath 
sat spellbound, watching drummer Sonny Greer in Duke Ellington's big band and 
decided what he was going to be.

1 INCUMBENT A CINCH TO WIN SCHOOL BOARD RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Redondo Beach voters will decide Tuesday whether to keep two incumbent members 
of the local elementary school board or to replace one of them with a retired 
principal. The two candidates with the most votes will win seats on the 
five-member board. 
</P>
<P>
The incumbents, Howard Huizing and Rebecca Sargent, and challenger Andrew 
Deliman agree that Redondo Beach City School District is in excellent shape 
after adjusting to a traumatic drop in enrollment over 20 years from 10,000 
students to 3,800 today. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews, the three candidates said the financial condition of the 
district is sound, the quality of education is high, teachers and 
administrators are first rate and many programs cut during the lean years have 
been restored. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a happy place," said Huizing, 69, the board president, who is seeking his 
second term. "Other districts envy our position." 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is going extremely well now," said Sargent, 43, who is running for 
her third term on the board. "But we need to keep moving forward." 
</P>
<P>
"We have a fine school system," said Deliman, 68, who worked for the district 
for 27 years as a principal before retiring in 1985. He listed 12 areas in 
which he would like to see further improvements, such as class-size reduction 
and computer education. 
</P>
<P>
The three candidates agreed that elementary districts in the three beach cities 
-- Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach -- are likely in the near 
future to absorb the secondary students now served by the troubled South Bay 
Union High School District. What form the reorganization may take will be 
discussed by the boards of the four districts at a joint meeting March 14. 
</P>
<P>
At South Bay Union, the student population has dropped from a high of 7,000 in 
the 1970s to 3,300. The decline is expected to continue along with mounting 
budget problems. The high school district has proposed a 
kindergarten-through-12th grade unification of all three beach cities. 
</P>
<P>
Deliman said: "Redondo Beach wants its own school system. . . . I might 
consider Hermosa Beach joining us, since it has only about 700 students." 
</P>
<P>
Both incumbents said a separate unified Redondo Beach system, possibly 
including Hermosa Beach, may be the best way to go, but said they will be open 
to all the options until they hear the views of the other districts. 
</P>
<P>
"I think unification is a good thing and we want to discuss the best way to do 
it," Huizing said. 
</P>
<P>
Sargent, who works as a paralegal in a Torrance law firm, was first elected in 
1981. She has been active as a volunteer in a number of state and local 
educational groups. 
</P>
<P>
Deliman worked for the Redondo Beach district for 29 years, including 27 years 
as a principal at various schools. Since retiring, he has worked as a 
substitute teacher in Torrance. He said he would like to see a stronger role 
for teachers in the district's operations and he proposed providing an annual 
report on school affairs to the community. 
</P>
<P>
Huizing also is a veteran of service in the Redondo Beach district. He was a 
teacher and basketball coach, then principal of the Washington school for 27 
years. Since his retirement, he has worked as a real estate agent.

<P>
MAN SENTENCED IN GRAFFITI CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 18-year-old Wilmington resident was sentenced to 130 days in jail and 
ordered to spend 100 hours cleaning up graffiti for spray-painting the wall of 
a house, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Miguel Angel Gonzales was sentenced Thursday by San Pedro Municipal Court Judge 
Roy S. Rekich after Gonzales pleaded no contest to one count of vandalism, 
according officials at the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales, who police suspect is a Wilmington gang member, was also placed on 
two-year summary probation and ordered to reimburse the owner of the house for 
the cost of removing the graffiti, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested Gonzales on the night of Feb. 18 when they saw him 
spray-painting the initials of a gang in three-foot-high letters on the wall of 
the house. 
</P>
<P>
Such convictions are rare because few people are caught in the act of 
vandalizing a building, said Mike Qualls, a spokesman for the city attorney's 
office.

SUPPORTS TEST FOR SENIOR DISCOUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In reference to the Torrance user fee services article (Times, Feb. 10.), I am 
a strong believer in the 100% individual fee-for-service concept. Some examples 
are the utilization of national parks, private aviation and boating, etc. Also 
a surcharge should be assessed for excessive library use. In regard to senior 
discounts, I heartily approve of those by private enterprises, such as coffee 
shops, restaurants, beauty and barber shops, etc. However, for public 
facilities, such as adult education, there should be a means test similar to 
those for school lunches. I question the 50% discount for affluent seniors over 
the age of 62 1/2 years old, provided by the Torrance Unified School District 
for Adult Education. Similarly, after observing many expensive autos parked at 
surplus cheese distribution locations, a means test should be applied. I 
(would) rather see this surplus cheese given to the poor and homeless.

33 COMPETE IN REGIONAL FINALS; 
</P>
<P>
TORRANCE HIGH JUNIOR TOPS HISTORY COMPETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ken Kuniyuki, a junior at Torrance High School, won the South Bay regional 
finals of a nationwide history, government and current events competition 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-three students from 11 area schools competed for 3 1/2 hours in the 
Citizen Bee event at the Hyatt Hotel at Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The question-and-answer session, one of a series of regional competitions held 
Saturday across Southern California, tested students' knowledge of American 
government and history, geography, economics, culture and current events. 
</P>
<P>
The Citizen Bee competition is sponsored by The Times, the Close Up Foundation, 
a nonprofit organization devoted to civic education, and Columbia Savings &amp; 
Loan Co. This is the first year the event has been held in California. 
</P>
<P>
Kuniyuki won $500 and a chance to participate in the state finals to be held 
next month in Los Angeles. He correctly answered the last history question of 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
He was asked to give the last name of the man who was the first Republican 
candidate for the presidency, served as a union general, and explored the West 
and fought for California's independence from Mexico. The correct answer was 
John C. Fremont. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Yamasaki, a junior at Gardena High School, placed second and received 
$300. 
</P>
<P>
David Samms Jr., a junior at San Pedro High, came in third and received $200. 
</P>
<P>
Students participating in the event came from high schools in Bellflower, 
Compton, Gardena, Harbor City, Long Beach, Manhattan Beach, Paramount, Redondo 
Beach, San Pedro and Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Winners of the statewide competition will receive a five-day expense-paid trip 
to the national finals in Washington, plus cash awards and college 
scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
The Close Up Foundation said the competition was designed to combat "an 
alarming lack of knowledge about the basics of American history, government and 
public life" among high school students.

BOARD APPROVES STORM DRAIN WORK TO PREVENT ANOTHER SLIDE IN MALIBU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, which in January agreed to a 
$35-million payment to Big Rock Mesa homeowners, has tentatively approved an 
elaborate storm drain project designed to prevent a repeat of the landslide 
that damaged or destroyed 250 homes in the Malibu neighborhood in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
But the board's approval of an environmental study for the project prompted an 
angry reaction from some of the homeowners in the area, who complained that the 
county has provided no estimate of the cost of the drainage work. The residents 
will have to pay for the project. 
</P>
<P>
"This is as if you go to a store and buy something, and after you buy it, the 
storekeeper tells you how much it costs. It's looney," said screenwriter Kurt 
Villadsen, a longtime Mesa homeowner. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know if it will cost $1,000 per home or $50,000," said Ken Chiate, an 
attorney who lives in the Big Rock Mesa area and who represented the homeowners 
in the recently settled lawsuit against the county and state. "It's a 
reflection of ineptness of the highest magnitude for them to be this far along 
and not know the cost." 
</P>
<P>
County officials say they have no reliable cost figures because the area's 
shifting geology could dramatically alter the price tag between now and the end 
of the year, when the Department of Public Works expects to present a financing 
plan to the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a cost figure. It's a developing proposal," said Roger Burger, a 
deputy director of public works. He said that when a good estimate is 
calculated, probably in three or four months, property owners will be notified. 
"We absolutely expect to keep them fully informed." 
</P>
<P>
Burger also noted that the county is not yet certain which property owners will 
benefit from the project and be billed for it. Even some of the 30 homes 
condemned after the 1983 slide could be assessed. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one of the things we have under study. . . . If the landslide is 
stabilized then that becomes a buildable lot," Burger said. 
</P>
<P>
Newsletters about Big Rock landslide problems have been sent to 550 Mesa-area 
addresses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors approved the environmental report last week so the county could 
apply to state agencies such as Caltrans and the Coastal Commission for permits 
required for construction, Burger said. 
</P>
<P>
The public works department created a furor last fall when its early estimate 
of per-home costs for a Malibu sewer system more than doubled in two months. 
Big Rock Mesa is in the new sewer district, and homeowners already have been 
assessed $9,999 for that project. 
</P>
<P>
Chiate said it is outrageous that the county would tentatively approve the 
storm drain project without an estimate of its cost. 
</P>
<P>
Since homeowners filed their lawsuit against the county in 1984, claiming that 
it had allowed construction that caused the landslide, "the county has refused 
to tell us what they're doing. Now we don't have any idea what they're doing. 
There has to be somebody who responds to homeowner inquiries." 
</P>
<P>
Burger said the county has kept property owners informed through a series of 
newsletters about the landslide. One sent in October mentioned the current 
project, reporting that: "Plans for permanent surface drainage improvements are 
close to being finalized." The newsletter estimated that construction would 
begin this summer. 
</P>
<P>
County officials have already begun negotiations with property owners for 
easements where storm drains will be built, offering $2,000 per easement, 
Chiate said. 
</P>
<P>
The new project consists of 10 catch basins and 7,000 feet of polyethylene pipe 
that would run across the mesa and in ravines and other natural runoff channels 
to Pacific Coast Highway, where a collection system will be installed. It may 
include new equipment to monitor landslides. 
</P>
<P>
The project also will place into underground vaults 18 wells that pump water 
from the water table. 
</P>
<P>
Those wells have been installed by the county under the aegis of a community 
improvement district, which homeowners helped form in 1983, after the slide. 
Since then, the county has spent nearly $4 million to pump millions of gallons 
of water from the ground and to monitor the continuing slippage of the mesa. 
</P>
<P>
That amount eventually will have to be repaid by homeowners in the improvement 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Chiate said homeowners, although hoping to gain local control over the 
improvement district, plan to cooperate with the county on the storm drain 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"If the county does what is reasonable and prudent, the homeowners are not 
going to object," he said. "It's their homes that are being saved."

INCLUDING FCA'S KNAPP IN S&amp;L STORY WRONGLY CREATED IMPRESSION OF GUILT BY 
ASSOCIATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Feb. 20, The Times carried an article on five former savings and loan 
executives, including our client, Charles W. Knapp, who resigned in August, 
1984, as chairman and chief executive of Financial Corp. of America ("Behind 
the Fallen Thrifts"). It was extremely unfair to include Knapp in a story with 
persons who have been convicted of crimes or who are targets of criminal 
prosecution; that improperly created the impression with your readers of guilt 
by association. 
</P>
<P>
Although your article on Knapp refers to "an internal FCA study done in 1986," 
it fails to state that FCA has refused to disclose the evidence supporting any 
of the conclusions in its study. More than 4 1/2 years have elapsed since 
Knapp's resignation and no criminal or administrative charges of wrongdoing 
have been brought, nor does he have any knowledge of any pending investigation. 
</P>
<P>
In October, 1986, Knapp filed a lawsuit against FCA in Los Angeles federal 
court in which he alleged that FCA made false and defamatory statements about 
him and improperly attributed to prior officers the responsibility for the 
failures of his successors. In addition, Knapp's lawsuit alleges that the 
matters for which he was blamed were disclosed in advance to and approved by 
FCA's auditors, attorneys, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the 
Federal Home Loan Bank Board and that the financial reporting of these matters 
was approved by FCA's accountants, audit committee and entire board of 
directors, which included respected members of the business, legal and academic 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
After Knapp resigned, he was named a defendant in several lawsuits. In the only 
case in which there was a final ruling on the merits, summary judgment was 
granted in favor of Knapp because there was no evidence "that Knapp was 
personally involved in any of the alleged misconduct, conspired to commit any 
of the alleged misconduct, or that he knew of it, authorized it, or ratified 
it." 
</P>
<P>
If you intended to report fairly, you would not have included Knapp in an 
article with convicted or about-to-be-indicted persons and you would have 
reported the facts set forth in this letter rather than quoting uncorroborated 
and confusing innuendo from anonymous sources.

STRANGE SILENCE IN S&amp;L DEBATE;

<P>
THOSE ON CAPITOL HILL WHO FAILED TO HEED WARNINGS ARE RETICENT TO RESPOND TO 
BUSH BAILOUT PLAN

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The real horror of the "Great Savings and Loan Crisis of 1989" is that no one, 
not President Bush, not Congress nor the S&amp;Ls themselves, are willing to 
address the root causes of the disaster. What this means is that whatever 
solution Washington finally agrees upon probably won't work very well or at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
While politics long has been the art of the possible, the trouble starts when 
there are so many separate agendas in conflict with one another that the art of 
the possible becomes corrupted into the craft of concealment and dissembling. 
</P>
<P>
By the same logic that allowed the staunchly anti-Red Richard M. Nixon to open 
doors to China, so it is that ardent free marketeer George Bush unblushingly 
proposed to nationalize scores of billions of dollars worth of S&amp;L assets 
and to pay for them with money he will raise by dipping into our own savings 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush plan calls for $50 billion in long-term bonds to be sold on Wall 
Street as part of a $150-billion-plus bailout and reorganization of the 
thrifts. Healthy savings and loans will be tapped twice, not only for cash to 
prop up ailing competitors but also to be part of the buyers' market to take 
over the 350 estimated "zombies" -- S&amp;Ls that are among the walking dead. 
</P>
<P>
The big winners in the turf wars are Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and 
L. William Seidman, head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures 
and regulates most U.S. banks. Brady will take charge of the Federal Home Loan 
Bank Board, which does for the S&amp;Ls what Seidman's FDIC does for the banks. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman gets the FHLB's insurance arm (the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance 
Corp.) and two New Deal-sounding agencies, the Resolution Funding Corp. and the 
Resolution Trusts, that will sell the $50 billion in long-term bonds. The 
Treasury will use your money to guarantee the principal of those bonds. The 
approximately 1,500 healthy S&amp;Ls will buy those bonds (somewhat 
unwillingly) and the interest probably will be paid by our tax dollars as well. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, yes, while the S&amp;Ls are busy pasting up the new FDIC deposit insurance 
decal on their doors, they will also be brought under tougher accounting rules 
and capital standards under the Bush plan. And $50 million more is to be given 
to the Justice Department to track down the upward of $3 billion in outright 
fraudulent losses that are estimated to be among the widespread wreckage of the 
zombies. 
</P>
<P>
If all this raises more questions than are answered, that's the point. Chief 
among the immediate questions is why the reaction to the President's rescue 
plan has been muted to nonexistent from those very opposition leaders of 
Congress who might normally stand up and holler about anything so radical as 
the takeover of 350 bankrupt S&amp;Ls and their assets or the repackaging of 
all that for resale to private buyers (including banks?). Not to mention the 
idea of playing honest broker for perhaps as many as 1,000 other weak but 
salvageable thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
While Congress is silent, even Bush's budget director, Richard Darman, is 
conceding that the interest-rate assumptions underlying the whole plan and 
wildly optimistic and will have to be sharply revised. 
</P>
<P>
The best answer for the quiet on Capitol Hill on the Bush plan is that many 
congressional leaders of both parties are taken by a fit of guilty conscience. 
Back in the bad old days of Jimmy Carter, the powerful S&amp;L lobby made a 
convincing case in 1980 and again in 1982 that the thrifts were being killed 
between the rock of high-digit short-term rates that they had to pay depositors 
and the hard place of lower home mortgage yields. "Deregulation" was the policy 
flavor of the month back then. 
</P>
<P>
Like the old Chinese curse, the S&amp;Ls got what they had wished for. They 
could offer money market fund deposit rates, they could make consumer loans and 
ultimately were allowed to invest in commercial real estate development, luxury 
yachts, consumer finance and other ventures long the preserve of the banks. 
Better still, they thought, regulators did not apply the same capital rules as 
those for banks. The minimum net worth an S&amp;L was supposed to maintain was 
cut and new thrifts were given 20 years to reach the required minimum. Small 
wonder that people began to open chartered thrifts in nothing larger than a 
post office box and rake in millions. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the interest rate squeeze on the thrifts is even more dangerous. Again, 
Congress bears part of the blame (along with the past and present occupants of 
the White House) for being unwilling and unable to deal with the annual budget 
deficit scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, there is little chance that the $60-billion reduction in the 
upcoming 1990 budget deficit mandated by the Gramm-Rudman compact will be 
achieved any time soon. And that means that already rising U.S. interest rates 
will rise further. Each percentage point rise in the prime and other interest 
rates not only adds $5 billion to the federal budget deficits, but it also 
extends the S&amp;L zombie list well beyond 350. 
</P>
<P>
So a good question might be, Just what good will that $50-billion new debt 
offering of the Bush Administration do except to buy time for things to get 
worse? And what about the billions of dollars of property -- shopping centers, 
half-built office towers, even cemeteries -- that will effectively be 
nationalized every time a regulatory agency takes over a zombie S&amp;L? The 
Bush plan pointedly ignored an already existing government effort to sell those 
bankrupt assets promptly back into the private sector and the agency is slated 
for dissolution. 
</P>
<P>
Other questions stack up quickly. First, do we really want to do away with the 
dual banking system (thrifts and commercial banks) that has financed this 
country's remarkable prosperity safely for the last 50 years? If so, where's 
the debate on the topic? Do we really believe that regulators can handle $40 
billion (or $60 billion or $100 billion) in soggy S&amp;L assets and get them 
back into the private sector? If so, where is the Bush Administration's 
estimate of the real flood of property headed this way? Or don't they know? 
</P>
<P>
And what if the healthy S&amp;Ls refuse to help? There is a split developing in 
the once united front already. Last month, the San Francisco Home Loan Bank 
voiced the unwillingness of the bigger and older California thrifts to bail out 
the upstarts that jump-started their way into the fast lane of finance only to 
crash at the first turn. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, does the Bush plan (or any likely alternative of the Congress) 
show any hope for creating a new financial services system that will be 
healthy, fraud-proof and provide efficient and safe capital management for 
depositor and borrower alike? 
</P>
<P>
None of these questions has been addressed either on Capitol Hill or at the 
other end of Pennsylvania Avenue at the White House. Different agendas are in 
play here.

AUTO POLICY IN A SPIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The positive tone of the Feb. 12 story, "The New International Auto," belies a 
more disturbing side of the trend toward globalization in automobile 
manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
The story said "a dizzying array of joint ventures . . . is rapidly blurring 
the distinction between the major Asian, European and American auto makers." 
Auto markets, however, aren't working the same way. While the wheels of 
commerce spin most markets into a "dizzy" mix, the borders of South Korea and 
Japan enclose an unnatural calm. 
</P>
<P>
Globalization of production fosters innovation and quality, diminishes 
insularity and encourages peace -- but only if it occurs across the board. 
Currently, Asian auto makers build plants in the United States and elsewhere, 
and sell cars in cooperation with American manufacturers, while Asian 
governments deftly prevent our Big Three from doing the same on their soil. 
</P>
<P>
The Times story concluded that "in more and more cases, there aren't any 
differences between American and foreign cars." The flavor is much less 
"global" on the streets of Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
Why do we have so little will to get as good as we give? What we truly need are 
Asian trade and business ownership policies that match our own.

EX-S&amp;L REGULATOR EYES CURRENT CRISIS AND SAYS 'I TOLD YOU SO' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM FURLONG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From his balmy perch in south Florida, Edwin J. Gray is basking in the glow of 
favorable publicity about his efforts to warn the nation of the impending 
thrift industry crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Gray's tenure as the nation's chief federal regulator for thrifts from 1983 to 
1987 was a tumultuous one, marred by staff upheaval, travel expense scandals 
and unending complaints about Gray's alleged inconsistency and incompetence as 
a regulator. 
</P>
<P>
But as time passes, Gray is starting to look like a prophet in his own time for 
his repeated public warnings about the approaching dangers that eventually 
overwhelmed the industry and threatened its future. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not only conceivable, but in my view very possible, that at some point 
in the future, massive infusions from the U.S. Treasury -- and hence the 
American taxpayers -- may well be necessary to shore up the system," Gray told 
a gathering of savings and loan executives in Washington in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Gray's dire warnings have proved unerringly correct. Hundreds of thrift 
failures, brought on by imprudent lending, have bankrupted the Federal Savings 
and Loan Insurance Corp. and forced the Bush Administration to come up with a 
taxpayer-assisted bailout proposal that is expected to cost at least $90 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Once excoriated by some members of Congress, Gray now encounters lavish praise. 
Rep. James Leach (R-Iowa) recently called Gray "one of the great martyrs in 
this crisis" who "found out what the problem was and acted like any honest, 
prudent man should have acted." 
</P>
<P>
Gray's past admonitions prompted Barron's magazine to compare him to William 
Mitchell, the Air Force general who was ultimately court-martialed for 
insubordination in his fight to prove the superiority of air power some seven 
decades ago. Mitchell sought to show the vulnerability of ships to air attack. 
</P>
<P>
"In many ways, Ed Gray . . . is a latter-day Billy Mitchell," the magazine 
said. "Though, unlike Mitchell, Gray has lived to see his dire predictions come 
true." 
</P>
<P>
Now president of a savings and loan in Miami, Gray has labored tirelessly to 
remind lawmakers and reporters about his public statements. 
</P>
<P>
He has compiled and distributed thick papers showing excerpts of his warnings 
going back to 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Using typically colorful rhetoric in a letter last year to The Times, Gray 
said: "The world was on notice. Red lights were flashing. I was the messenger. 
The FSLIC crisis didn't happen overnight, or in a vacuum. . . . Where was 
everybody when I was ringing the alarm bells?" 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Gray still has many critics, who say he was extremely difficult to 
deal with and a poor administrator with little executive experience. Gray is an 
erstwhile public relations man who worked for former President Ronald Reagan in 
both Sacramento and Washington before taking the regulatory job. 
</P>
<P>
His warnings notwithstanding, detractors say it was Gray who failed to rein in 
fast-growing thrifts that later failed. "He's rewriting history," said 
California thrift executive Herbert M. Sandler. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, history's verdict on Gray is likely to be neither white nor black. 
As longtime thrift industry analyst Jonathan Gray put it: "The guy has been 
vindicated. It's unfortunate that he was not adept politically."

CORPORATE CONSCIENTIOUSNESS IS CHANGING THE WAY U.S. CONSUMERS SHOP 
</P>

Pauline Quan doesn't chew Wrigley's gum anymore. 
</P>
<P>
A bookkeeper in Arlington Heights, Ill., Quan switched to Warner-Lambert Co.'s 
Sticklets after the company that makes Wrigley's gum was accused by a nonprofit 
group of being socially irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
"No more Wrigley products for me," she wrote in a letter to the Wm. Wrigley Jr. 
Co. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Quan is among a growing number of American consumers who browse the aisles of 
supermarkets searching for products made by companies that they believe have a 
conscience and a sense of social responsibility. Many consult tools such as 
"Shopping for a Better World," a pocket guide to "socially responsible 
supermarket shopping" that gave Wrigley the bad rap. 
</P>
<P>
The guide, compiled by the Council on Economic Priorities, looks at 138 
companies and 1,300 products, evaluating them on such issues as the advancement 
of women and minorities, protection of the environment, community outreach and 
charitable giving. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dinner Raises Awareness 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, there is a segment -- a growing one in the consumer base -- which is 
increasingly concerned with the corporate consciences of the companies they do 
business with," said James E. Preston, chairman and CEO of Avon Products Inc., 
which has been cited by the council for having a "corporate conscience." 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, many companies have become more concerned about their social 
images. "Any corporation that doesn't project itself as concerned about the 
welfare of its consumers is basically stuck in time with a very primitive 
marketing program," said Herbert Chao Gunther, executive director of the Public 
Media Center, a public interest advertising firm in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
According to a council survey, 80% of the consumers it polled said they had 
changed their shopping habits after reading the guide. Two-thirds said they 
were in the habit of looking something up when they shop, and about the same 
number actually remembered company ratings. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer awareness also is raised by an annual awards dinner the council 
sponsors to recognize companies with exemplary performance in areas such as 
equal opportunity, charitable giving, employee responsiveness, environmental 
responsibility and community action. 
</P>
<P>
Companies that made the grade this year included: 
</P>
<P>
Arlington, Va.-based Applied Energy Services, an independent power generator 
and consultant, made the list for a tree-planting program in Guatemala designed 
to combat the greenhouse effect; Dayton Hudson, a Minneapolis-based chain of 
retail stores, for its 43-year-old charitable giving program; Federal Express 
for "employer responsiveness," particularly its no layoff policy and Eastman 
Kodak for its support of small businesses owned by women, minorities and the 
handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficult to Gauge 
</P>
<P>
H .B. Fuller, the paint and adhesive company, and Newman's Own, a company 
founded by actor Paul Newman, received honorable mentions. 
</P>
<P>
At the bottom of the list, at least according to the council's criteria, were 
Du Pont -- for its role in managing the Savannah River nuclear power plant -- 
and meatpacker John Morrell &amp; Co. The company was fined $4.3 million for 
having dangerous conditions in the work place. Both were to receive 
dishonorable mentions. 
</P>
<P>
Du Pont has attributed its difficulties at the plant to outside technical 
inspectors and insists that it never tried to cover up any problems. 
</P>
<P>
Morrell has accused both the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and 
congressional Democrats of mounting a vendetta against the company. Morrell 
officials said that the company has cleaned up most of the safety violations it 
was fined for allowing. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the interest and activism of some consumers, it is difficult to gauge 
how corporate social behavior translates into sales -- or lost sales -- the 
cash register. 
</P>
<P>
Wrigley, for example, did not respond to a survey from the council, and said 
its first obligation is to its shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
"Our social responsibility is as strong as any corporation's, but why should we 
support some group making a business out of sending these things out," said 
William Piet, Wrigley's vice president of corporate affairs. The company does 
its giving through a special foundation, he said, which was not included in the 
guide's ratings. 
</P>
<P>
Many corporations in the past 20 years have improved their track record in 
areas such as charitable giving, the promotion of women, and their role South 
Africa, according to Alice Tepper Marlin, executive director of the council. 
</P>
<P>
Marlin points out, however, that gains have been offset by what she views as 
negative developments -- the rise of corporate giving to political action 
committees and the effect of mergers, acquisitions and leveraged buyouts on 
corporate volunteerism, charitable giving and employee benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"Their consciences vary as much as they do for any individual," she said.

TOWER BESIEGED . . .AS BUSH TEAM BUNGLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

during Ronald Reagan's first term, is editor at large for U.S. News and World 
Report.

<TEXT>
<P>
Would someone please turn off the campaign motor at the White House. George 
Bush has all the makings of a good President but more often he has been acting 
like a candidate, dashing from one event to the next, improvising a theme a 
week, elevating style over substance and, most recently, allowing the fight 
over John Tower to become a high-risk, bloody squabble with the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Understandably, his young staff tries to imitate campaign masters like Roger 
Ailes, Bob Teeter and Lee Atwater: They helped Bush become a highly effective 
nominee. But a President must be more serious, focusing the nation on long-term 
goals, driving it steadily toward them. He must build a government that can 
effectively manage. He must deliver on his policies. And he must do it all with 
an occasional touch of majesty. 
</P>
<P>
Win or lose on Tower, Bush now stands perilously on the edge of a cliff. He has 
impressed Congress and the country with his openness, his hands-on, 
knowledgeable approach and his obvious good will. But there is a deepening 
sense that something is badly amiss. Some of his most ardent friends furrow 
their brows and quietly shake their heads, wondering how he can draw back from 
the precipice. 
</P>
<P>
Seasoned observers began asking early on if the Administration knew where it 
was going. So far, except on the thrift crisis and elements of a budget plan, 
it has been extraordinarily vague. As time has dragged on and policies remain 
in limbo, the questions have been getting tougher: Do these folks know who is 
coming with them? So far, despite some fine appointments at the top, they have 
only a shell of a government. At Defense, Bush has 41 key slots to fill that 
require confirmation and to date he has sent the Senate only two names, one of 
them Tower. At Transportation, two of 17 names have gone up; at Energy, two of 
20; at Interior, one of 18 -- and the new secretary has been off for 11 days in 
Guam. The pace, slowest on record, leaves the Administration adrift in many 
areas. Hence, a third question rises: Do these folks even know what they are 
doing? 
</P>
<P>
The biggest surprise is how often the White House is surprised. In the Tower 
affair, no one seemed to understand that a private briefing of Republican 
senators on an FBI report would infuriate Democrat Sam Nunn of Georgia, 
chairman of the Armed Services Committee and a well-known stickler for 
senatorial courtesies. A few days later, the White House was surprised when the 
committee voted against Tower's confirmation. Winging toward Japan, staff 
members were smug -- at least three Democrats would come down on their side. No 
delay, not even a presidential phone call was deemed necessary from Air Force 
One. Last Sunday, the White House didn't know in advance that Tower would take 
an oath to stay cold sober should he become defense secretary. 
</P>
<P>
"The surprised President." We have heard that before. Republicans remember it 
as an epithet they hurled with devastating effectiveness against Jimmy Carter, 
accusing him and his staff of failing to appreciate how the world works. 
</P>
<P>
The Carter team at least had an excuse -- they were outsiders new to 
Washington. The Bush team can hardly advance that argument. Bush, after all, is 
the pre-eminent insider, the walking resume with 14 years of executive branch 
service -- more than any President since William Howard Taft. In his Cabinet 
and other key posts are veterans with more than 114 years of experience in past 
administrations, probably another record. Not counting Tower, six former 
members of Congress are there to advise; this is the Administration that is 
supposed to know how to play in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Bush loyalists say they are simply getting their sea legs, that it's still 
early; even if the Beltway natives are restless, the new President enjoys the 
approval of 60% of the general public, exceeding Ronald Reagan at this stage. 
The future may well vindicate their views but the past lends scant support. 
Carter learned that if the Beltway crowd turns against you, as it did in the 
early months of his presidency, those feelings ripple out and can eventually 
sink a President. To maintain equilibrium through a storm, a President needs a 
rock-solid core constituency that will stick with him no matter what. When 
Reagan came to town, he could count upon a reliable ideological base of about 
30%-35% of the voters and they sustained him through the recession of 1981-82. 
Neither Carter nor Gerald R. Ford had a natural core constituency and were 
tossed about in every gale. While Bush may be riding high with the public 
today, the evidence suggests that he does not yet have a solid base and that 
favorable views of him are lightly held, based mostly on his attractive style. 
His first 100 days in office are crucial to begin building core support. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, fingers point in every direction. For the press, the villain du jour 
is White House chief of staff John H. Sununu. Should Tower fail, Sununu will be 
blamed for mishandling relations with Congress and for traveling with Bush when 
he might have tended the nomination battle back home. (It will be interesting 
to see how much credit he will be given if Tower wins.) The more serious 
question is whether Sununu is falling into the Don Regan trap, hesitating to 
bring in a top-flight staff and spending so much time at the President's side 
that he can't break away to devise and execute strategy. An exceptionally 
bright man, Sununu will presumably learn quickly from early blunders. 
Meanwhile, whispers even rise among some Republicans in Congress about Bush 
himself, questioning his wisdom in forcing them to defend Tower and his 
slowness in forming a government. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, it doesn't really matter who made what mistakes. What matters is 
whether the Administration appreciates its precarious position and swiftly 
moves to right itself. The White House currently plans to recover from the 
Tower fight by putting Bush on the road every two or three days to sell his 
program, campaign style. That's a mistake. If he hits the road again, does he 
really have anything to say? Not much, to judge by his last road trips at home. 
Moreover, Bush has already proved that he is a man of prodigious energy, but he 
is moving around so much that he's exhausting his staff and making people 
nervous. Even the Secret Service has nicknamed him "the Mexican jumping bean." 
</P>
<P>
What's needed is for Bush to show the same self-discipline he has in the past 
when faced with difficulties. He needs to ettle down in the White House for a 
while and concentrate on personnel and policy, giving his government more 
coherence. His recruiters say that the appointments process is bogged down by 
paper work and FBI clearances. Surely, the President can slice through that 
thicket by raising hell with the system. 
</P>
<P>
The White House must also ensure that policy-making is on track. In his first 
speech to Congress, Bush promised that a major review of national security and 
defense issues would be completed by May 10. There are signs of the process 
falling behind, handicapped by a lack of players from the departments. But 
within the next few weeks, leaders in other nations -- not to mention the press 
-- will begin to expect imaginative, well-considered answers. 
</P>
<P>
On both personnel and policies, Bush would serve himself well if he lifted his 
sights. There is a tendency within the Administration to think the main task on 
jobs is simply to fill the vacant slots. But the White House would be greatly 
strengthened if a few heavyweights from the past came in on a temporary basis, 
giving the more junior players now there more time to catch hold. 
</P>
<P>
Bush had a first-class campaign because, as manager Atwater boasted, it was run 
by 23 senior veterans from past campaigns. Strikingly, not one of those 
veterans joined Bush at the White House. The theory was that Bush wasn't a 
terribly good campaigner -- that he needed such help -- but he would be such a 
pro as President that he didn't need them. Wrong. Noone can master the 
presidency alone. The current White House is leaving it up to Bush to carry the 
ball on every play, when in fact, he needs and deserves as much help as in the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Because financial resoures are limited, the Administration has felt compelled 
to make only modest legislative proposals. Instead of overarching themes, it 
has pursued what one insider calls "a little agenda" of small changes in 
education, housing, the environment and the like. Even those proposals have 
been presented with so little sustained fanfare that the press isn't paying 
much attention. As a result, Bush seems highly reactive, a President chained to 
his in-box. In these early days, it's the out-box that counts. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Bush has shied away from what he has called "the vision thing," but 
he needs to overcome his misgivings and adopt a larger view of what he wants to 
achieve. Surely he wants to do more than manage problems as they come and 
surely the country needs more, too. In a nation where 3,000 kids drop out of 
school every day and where foreign indebtedness increases by $300 million a 
day, a President has a huge canvas upon which to paint. Bush doesn't need a lot 
of money to rally the country to greatness; he needs only a sense of clarity 
and urgency about the nation's future. 
</P>
<P>
Once the White House knows where it wants to go, it can more easily formulate 
public strategy. At the moment, it is being nibbled and nicked to death by 
small stories because the Administration is generating so few big stories to 
dominate the news. The Tower fight would have been major news in any 
Administration but it has been allowed to escalate beyond all proportion. Bush 
has been absolutely right to stick by his man and defend the powers of his 
office against ambitious Democrats. A victory would be an obvious boost for 
him. But he has taken an enormous gamble putting so much personal prestige on 
the line and letting the process drag on so long. 
</P>
<P>
Few in Washington relish the prospect of a weak presidency. There is a 
gathering consensus in both parties that the country needs an effective leader. 
Congressional Democrats may insist upon greater parity with the White House but 
as they know, four of the last five Presidents left office with enormous 
frustration and despair; over that period, the United States suffered a 
relative decline in world power. How can we respond to Soviet changes or 
compete against rising powers in Japan and Europe if its own Capitol is in a 
mess? 
</P>
<P>
Much of Washington would like to see George Bush succeed. Republicans are fond 
of him and the First Lady, who has made a smashing impression. Democrats for a 
change appear happy as the congressional party and, once beyond Tower, seem 
disposed to work with Bush. The question from the Tower affair is whether the 
White House has learned from early mistakes and misfortunes. If so, they can 
still pull back from the cliff -- but they had better hurry.

PLEDGING ALLEGIANCE TO ONE NATION, DIVIDED BY TWO RELIGIOUS FACTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert Wuthnow, Robert Wuthnow, who teaches sociology at Princeton 
University, is the author of The Restructuring of American Religion: Society 
and Faith Since World War II (Princeton University Press).

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Americans have been urged repeatedly in recent months to make this, using 
President Bush's words, "a kinder and gentler nation." We have been asked to 
show compassion to our enemies, to seek common ground and social kindness and 
to engage in activities that enrich and ennoble us all. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout much of our nation's history religious conviction supplied the 
muscle necessary to put such fine admonitions into practice. Utilitarian 
self-interest was constrained, as Alexis de Tocqueville observed on his visit 
to the United States in the 1830s, by a common tradition of biblical virtue and 
by extensive participation in voluntary religious organizations. Whether they 
belonged to one faith or another, believers found much on which to agree. As 
recently as the early 1960s, when Will Herberg published his widely read book 
"Protestant, Catholic, Jew: An Essay in American Religious Sociology," 
America's several faiths seemed to provide a common identity and shared 
assumptions about our nation's calling. 
</P>
<P>
Today American religion is less a source of kindness and gentleness -- or even 
gentility -- than it is a war zone of antagonism. Rather than infusing public 
debate with harmony and reconciliation, it presents an image of tension and 
conflict. The one public theology Tocqueville saw uniting us has been torn 
asunder by two competing factions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A conservative public theology champions strong traditional morality, 
strong national defenses and a heady brew of free enterprise. It stakes its 
authority in a literal interpretation of the Bible and claims to return the 
nation to biblical ideals on which it was founded. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A liberal public theology argues for a more relativistic code of personal 
morality, a cooperative multilateral spirit in foreign relations and strong 
government initiatives capable of infusing norms of social justice into the 
capitalist mind. It also stakes its authority on biblical tradition, but often 
interprets this legacy as cultural wisdom rather than divine revelation. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides believe deeply that religious values must be heard in the public 
square. They hold implicitly that the United States must be godly -- or at 
least good -- if it is to remain great. They take their cues from religious 
sentiments expressed in the Declaration of Independence and printed on U.S. 
currency. They hold strongly that America is, as we say when we recite the 
Pledge of Allegiance, "under God." But the two place emphasis on different 
understandings of what it means to be a nation under God. Indeed, the two 
positions can be summarized with reference to different phrases in the Pledge 
of Allegiance itself. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of a conservative public theology stress the fact that the United 
States is "one nation" under God. Translated: We are unique, a special nation, 
privileged by having been chosen of God, unlike any other nation in the world. 
Our forebears founded the nation on biblical concepts. They believed we were a 
covenant people, the New Israel. Even to this day, conservative religionists 
argue, the United States has a special mission to fulfill for God. It is a 
mission of hope for the Free World, of opposition to atheistic communism, of 
presenting an image of biblical morality to the world. To be true to our 
calling, they argue, we must unite once again around these collective ideals. 
</P>
<P>
The liberal public theology takes its cue from the phrase "with liberty and 
justice for all." Liberty means greater tolerance and diversity. Justice means 
a driving concern for minorities and the poor. In this view, America has a 
special role to play in the world mainly because of its power, not because of a 
special divine calling. As long as Americans enjoy material success and 
military power, they must use it for the common good of the world. Liberal 
religionists agree that America must be a lamp shining in darkness. But the 
glow of this light must shine especially on deeds of mercy toward the poor and 
of justice for the oppressed. 
</P>
<P>
How deep is this division? According to a Gallup survey, the American public 
divides itself almost evenly between religious conservatism and religious 
liberalism. About 40% put themselves in each camp when asked about their 
religious beliefs. At the extremes, about 20% say they are either very liberal 
or very conservative religiously. The same study showed that a majority of the 
public regards the conflict between religious conservatives and liberals as an 
area of serious tension. Conservatives described liberals as unloving, shallow 
and unsaved. Liberals characterized conservatives as rigid, narrow-minded and 
fanatical. And that survey was several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Newer evidence shows that this division in orientation corresponds closely to 
differences of opinion on a wide range of religious beliefs and social issues 
-- from views of the Bible to opinions about abortion or positions on welfare 
spending. It is aggravated, not lessened, by greater contact with the other 
side and by greater knowledge about the other side. And it cuts through the 
middle of all the major faiths and denominations. Thus, conservative 
Methodists, for instance, often feel they have more in common with conservative 
Catholics or conservative Baptists than they do with liberal Methodists. 
</P>
<P>
In short, the two varieties of public theology that offer competing definitions 
of what it means to be a kind and gentle nation have cast their shadow broadly 
on the American people. Antagonism between religious liberals and religious 
conservatives comes not only from the voices of the Rev. Jerry Falwell and 
Norman Lear or from the bureau chiefs of the National Council of Churches and 
the National Assn. of Evangelicals. It gains expression in local pulpits and 
prayer fellowships. And it has begin to register in public-opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
We have, of course, experienced religious conflict many times in U.S. history. 
But the current division is particularly deep. The abortion debate has been an 
especially serious source of misgiving. Feminism, prayer in public schools, 
pornography, AIDS and the sex scandals of highly visible TV evangelists have 
all added fuel to the flames of religious controversy. Genuine differences of 
theological interpretation and moral conviction are at issue. But differences 
in educational levels and life styles add to the level of misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
The conflict is largely a product of the turbulent quarter century we have 
experienced as a nation since the early 1960s. The civil-rights movement drew 
some of the initial lines still dividing religious liberals from religious 
conservatives. The Vietnam War reinforced those initial differences. In both 
instances, these were events that challenged longstanding assumptions about the 
impact of our values on our nation's behavior. Increasingly, religious leaders 
questioned whether good values alone would lead to good behavior. And as they 
did, some -- those who were to be called liberals -- began to emphasize the 
behavior of direct action while others -- conservatives -- argued for purity of 
values. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1970s, two other developments added to the growing cleavage between 
religious liberals and conservatives. One was the rapid growth in religious 
special-interest groups. Ethnic and racial caucuses in the major denominations, 
special organizations for homosexuals and an increasingly wide array of 
conservative groups -- Presbyterian Laymen, the Creation Research Society, 
Moral Majority -- all came into being to pressure their denominations and the 
public at large in one direction or another. 
</P>
<P>
The other development was a marked erosion in the significance of traditional 
denominational boundaries and of the barriers between Protestants and Catholics 
and between Christians and Jews. The very reduction of these divisions made it 
easier for leaders on the left and on the right to mobilize large 
constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
The 1980s has been a decade of nearly continuous battle between these religious 
constituencies. Public officials have often courted one side or the other. 
Preachers have become more active politically. And in the process much of the 
latent conflict between evangelicals and fundamentalists on the one hand and 
liberals and secularists on the other has become painfully evident. 
</P>
<P>
What then are the implications? For the 10% to 20% of the public that has 
become indifferent to religion, the most likely conclusion is to say a plague 
on both your houses. Neither side will inspire conviction as long as it is at 
the other's throat. 
</P>
<P>
For those who still care about our nation's churches, parishes, synagogues and 
fellowship halls, the gravity of the situation needs to be recognized. Priority 
must be given to counsels of reconciliation. The common ground must indeed be 
sought. And within this common ground, genuine diversity must be encouraged. 
For, as Jefferson recognized, pluralism can only strengthen our nation, but 
polarization always weakens it.

MANAGUA: KEEP PLANNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration is finally moving to implement a new U.S. policy toward 
Nicaragua and its Sandinista government. Initial reports indicate that 
President Bush's approach will be more balanced and constructive than the 
hostile military stance that failed so miserably under Ronald Reagan. But while 
a new Nicaragua policy is certainly welcome, support for the plan will depend 
on what emerges when the White House gets more specific on some crucial points. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III has been briefing key members of Congress 
on the new Nicaragua strategy in an effort to generate bipartisan support on 
its behalf -- something Reagan rarely achieved during the eight years he spent 
trying to oust the Sandinistas. Baker says the new Administration is willing to 
support recent diplomatic efforts by Central American leaders to negotiate a 
reduction of the tensions between Nicaragua and its neighbors. The United 
States is even prepared to offer financial assistance and other economic 
benefits, like lifting a U.S. trade embargo against Nicaragua, as an incentive 
towards peace. But this will happen only if the Sandinistas make good on 
promises to restore freedom and democracy inside Nicaragua prior to the 
election of a new government in early 1990. That is a reasonable stance. 
</P>
<P>
However, Baker also has told Congress that the Administration wants to keep 
sending food, clothing and other forms of "humanitarian" aid to the Contra 
rebels fighting to overthrow the Sandinistas. While the Administration has 
given up Reagan's fantasy that the Contras will somehow, some day, defeat the 
Sandinistas militarily, Baker argues the Contras must remain a viable force in 
order to keep pressure on the Sandinistas. 
</P>
<P>
There is a superficial logic to Bush and Baker's carrot-and-stick approach to 
the Contras that may appeal to many in Congress. Unfortunately, it overlooks 
some harsh realities about the current situation in Central America. The 
government of Honduras, the U.S. ally that has been the Contras' chief base of 
operations, is increasingly restive over their presence. What assurances can 
Bush offer the Hondurans that the heavily armed fighters now living on their 
borderlands will be disbanded once they are no longer needed? Contra military 
commanders have so far indicated no willingness to give up their goal of 
defeating the Sandinistas, no matter how remote the odds of achieving it. What 
is to keep renegade Contras from pursuing their own agenda -- fighting a futile 
war that could eventually degenerate into banditry or even terrorism? That 
could be what the Bush Administration and Congress are risking if they simply 
renew aid to the Contras, even if it is restricted to humanitarian aid, without 
having an alternative plan ready. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly the Contras must not be abandoned outright. They have been surrogate 
fighters for the U.S. government for too long to be treated shabbily. There is 
precedent from the Vietnam War and the failed Bay of Pigs invasion for helping 
defeated surrogates. But, so far, the Bush Administration has given no sign 
that it has even thought about this eventuality. Before Congress agrees to 
provide any more aid to the Contras, it must insist that Bush's new Nicaragua 
strategy include a specific plan for withdrawing the Contras from the 
battlefield.

HIROHITO'S FUNERAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I cannot find the words to describe the feelings I am undergoing regarding 
President Bush's trip to Japan for the funeral of Hirohito. 
</P>
<P>
I remember so well the three years-plus I spent as a young Marine in the 
Pacific. I cannot forget all the dead on all those islands. The remains of all 
the sailors and Marines entombed on the Arizona, the death marches -- dear God, 
has it all been forgotten? 
</P>
<P>
Bush did not have to go. I feel such sorrow and such shame for us all.

SOCIAL WORKER'S TRAGIC DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We mourn the tragic and untimely death of a committed and compassionate social 
worker, Robbyn Panitch, who died while doing what she loved; helping the 
disenfranchised and desperate members of our society, the homeless chronically 
mentally disabled. Your editorial ("Death at the Clinic," Feb. 23) expressed 
the deep feelings that we all share for a colleague who represented the highest 
ideals of our profession: respect for the inherent worth of all human beings, 
and a firm belief in equal opportunities for all members of our society. I am 
personally proud to be a social worker. 
</P>
<P>
During this time of grief, we must be reminded of our collective responsibility 
to strongly advocate for the necessary resources and support to provide 
accessible and comprehensive care and treatment for mentally disabled 
individuals; and to alleviate the societal conditions which aggravate their 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
It is ironic that in March, designated as "Professional Social Work Month," the 
National Assn. of Social Workers will initiate a yearlong campaign -- "There's 
No Place Like Home" -- focusing on the plight of the country's estimated 3 
million homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
To the memory of Robbyn Panitch, and to all others who are working with this 
population, go our deepest respect and strongest support.

STALKING SIR FRANCIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Drakes Bay is, beyond all reasonable doubt, the place on the California coast 
where Sir Francis Drake careened and repaired the Golden Hind in 1595 before 
setting sail for England and home, we learned the other day, reading the latest 
copy of the Smithsonian Institution Research Reports. The endless debate over 
the authenticity of the site is over. The early historians, who first proposed 
the location, have been proven correct. 
</P>
<P>
The report inspired us to talk with the two scholars who produced the last bit 
of evidence that clinched the case. They had sorted out the mystery through 
Ming Dynasty shards found among Coast Miwok tribe relics at the Point Reyes 
National Seashore that now embraces Drakes Bay. 
</P>
<P>
It was Clarence F. Shangraw, chief curator of the Museum of Asian Art in San 
Francisco, who made the first spectacular discovery. He found that the 708 bits 
and pieces of what once had been 235 cups, bowls, plates and a vase were from 
two distinct periods of manufacture, some made in the mid 1570s, some made 20 
years later, in the mid-1590s. He was able to date each shard and specify where 
in China it had been made. 
</P>
<P>
Then Edward P. Von der Porten, director of the Treasure Island Museum, made the 
second discovey: The older shards showed no signs of sea damage, even though 
they were finer and more delicate. But those made around 1595 had been worn in 
the way that pounding surf and sand smooth rough edges. "Two totally 
independent methods of analysis gave us identical answers," Von der Porten 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The answers, they reported, are clear: The older shards had to have been 
carried carefully ashore. They could only have come from Drake's ship. They had 
to be from the crates of precious Chinese ceramics logged aboard the Golden 
Hind when they were pirated by Drake from Spanish outposts and ships along the 
Central American Coast of the Pacific Ocean on the voyage before he reached 
Point Reyes. Records make clear that the crates were not aboard when the Golden 
Hind returned to England. As Drake consolidated his supplies for the long 
voyage home, he must reluctantly have lightened cargo and left the dishes for 
the Indians to use. 
</P>
<P>
The ceramics made a generation later must have been aboard the San Agustin, a 
Spanish trading vessel plying the Pacific between Acapulco and Manila. It had 
been blown far off course and then sank in a terrible storm at Drakes Bay on 
Nov. 30, 1595. Efforts to locate the wreckage, buried in centuries of 
accumulated sand, are now being planned. But detailed records of the shipwreck 
itself permit accurate dating. 
</P>
<P>
There was a lively but risky trade across the Pacific in those days, dominated 
by Spanish galleons running between the west coast of Mexico and the 
Philippines and Indonesia. Chinese ceramics were transferred in junks from 
points of manufacture to the trading ports, such as Manila. Galleons brought 
them to places like Acapulco. They were carted overland to Vera Cruz for 
shipment to Europe where extraordinary prices were paid, even for the 
lower-quality goods. Drake's booty included the finest products of Jingdezhen 
in south-central China, the center of fine ceramics from the 14th Century even 
to this day. But the San Agustin's cargo was of poorer-quality bowls and plates 
made on the south coast by entrepreneurs quick to respond to the lucrative 
market. 
</P>
<P>
The Miwok tribespeople apparently smashed most of the ceramics that came into 
their possession to make jewelry, even one elegant pendant, and to fashion 
effective tools for scraping hides. "Each culture finds a different use," 
Shangraw said philosophically. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the shards are now part of a traveling exhibition being shown in major 
museums, but Von der Porten hopes for a permanent exhibit in California one of 
these days. That will help him respond to the continuing skepticism that some 
still express about just where it was that Drake landed.

SOCIAL WORKER'S TRAGIC DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The tragedy of Robbyn Panitch's death is overwhelming to her parents as well as 
all of us. Hopefully, her tragedy will not prevent others from pursuing the 
noblest goals of helping people in distress. 
</P>
<P>
It is disturbing, however, to note the reactions of her parents in distress. 
Her father, "a Democratic Party activist," was liberal in his blame of Prop. 
13, Gov. George Deukmejian and former President Ronald Reagan. Never mind that 
a guard at the entrance of the facility would most likely have had little 
effect, that the ACLU has to a large degree been responsible for keeping 
violent, psychiatric people in the streets if they do not agree to be 
hospitalized, that Ms. Panitch voluntarily and altruistically entered a 
profession with a high degree of potential violence (even responding to 911 
emergency calls to strange behavior), that her parents' politics probably were 
a factor in steering her to devotion to the public good with an increased 
exposure to potential violence. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Panitch, there are many problems in our society which need correction and 
improvement. All of us, liberal as well as conservative, deplore tragedies such 
as occurred to your daughter. We obviously have different ideas and concepts on 
how to approach many of society's problems. However, your liberal heart ought 
to include the ability to intellectualize that good is not captive of liberals, 
while evil is not pervasive in conservatives. Honest men honestly differ.

AIDS TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Research Council's recommendation that every baby born in the 
United States should be "anonymously" tested for AIDS antibodies seems 
guaranteed to offend just about everybody in exchange for statistics of, at 
least, marginal utility (Part I, Feb. 9). Were I the parent of a newborn child, 
I would demand, as an absolute right, to know of any condition which 
represented a potential health hazard to my child. Anything less would strike 
me as game playing of the worst sort. 
</P>
<P>
This "recommendation" makes me wonder just how much the council members, for 
all their medical and scientific expertise, know about how real flesh-and-blood 
human beings feel and operate.

JOHN PATIERNO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The obituary of John Patierno (Part I, Feb. 28) contained a major error of fact 
which does injustice to the brilliant engineering record established by 
Patierno over the past 33 years. 
</P>
<P>
The article leaves the impression that Patierno left behind an ongoing B-2 wing 
redesign at the time of his death. That is incorrect. As The Times previously 
reported (Oct. 29, 1988), "The effort to redesign the wing started about five 
years ago when the Air Force changed its assumptions about how low the bomber 
would have to fly, requiring that the plane have a stronger structure, Gen. 
Larry D. Welch said in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
The Times also noted that Welch said the new wing is both lighter and stronger 
and has an even smaller radar visibility than the original design. "It was a 
brilliant effort," he added. 
</P>
<P>
That "brilliant effort" was led by, and completed under the direction of, John 
Patierno. The results of that effort were built into the first B-2, which 
rolled out for the first time last November.

HIROHITO'S FUNERAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Conrad's cartoon showing a dead Hirohito in his casket saying "They won the 
battles, but we won the war" (Feb. 24) is historically inaccurate in its 
implication. We assume from the cartoon that Conrad is fostering the popular 
notion that the Japanese are winning the war economically, when they couldn't 
do it militarily. 
</P>
<P>
The facts are different: In Japan prior to World War II there were two strong 
opposing policies among the people in the power structure, i.e., whether Japan 
should attempt to dominate and prosper through military means, or, to pursue 
business and economic goals. As we all know, the military people won that 
struggle. At the end of the war the military faction was discredited. Emperor 
Hirohito was associated with that point of view. The people of Japan who were 
for peace and doing business were right. 
</P>
<P>
The power structure responsible for the war is gone; "they" did not "win the 
war" in the post-war era by selling cars and TVs. To say that the Japanese want 
to win a war against America fosters jingoism and hatred. I think the Japanese 
just want to make a living, like the rest of us, and are doing a good job at 
business. Business isn't war.

SHORT TAKES: THE MAN OF KABUKI TALKS ABOUT THE WOMEN OF KABUKI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The steps, in turn, were maundering, menacing, mincing. The facial expression 
switched from snort to smirk with the rise or fall of a painted eyebrow. 
</P>
<P>
It was a mini-tour of the recondite world of Kabuki, Japan's popular theater, 
and with Leonard Pronko as guide, the lecturees at the Pacific Asia Museum in 
Pasadena last week were not only instructed but enthralled. 
</P>
<P>
Pronko, professor of theater arts at Pomona College, was the first non-Japanese 
to study Kabuki at Japan's National Theater, and his Pasadena insights, many 
agreed, were as much fun as a performance. 
</P>
<P>
That a man should interpret the art form was only fitting, since Kabuki now is 
an all-male province. Not always, though, Pronko explained. 
</P>
<P>
Originally "a sort of folk dance, with erotic and comic elements added," Kabuki 
was introduced in Kyoto in the 1590s by a woman named Okuni. Her troupe was 
wholly female, Pronko said, "many of them prostitutes." By 1629, woman dancers 
were outlawed "because the important part of the performance was taking place 
after the performance." 
</P>
<P>
Even the word Kabuki has changed meaning: "Originally," Pronko said, "it meant 
'leaning' -- leaning in the wrong direction -- since the early actors indeed 
had strange, and not entirely savory, bents." Now the word means, "song, dance 
and skill," the final bowdlerization of a once-bawdy divertissement. 
</P>
<P>
Men now perform stylized male and female roles alike. "They had to devise a way 
to suggest not a woman but absolute femininity," Pronko said, "the essence of a 
woman." And they did it so well that "nowadays, they say a woman can't possibly 
capture that elusive essence." What she would have to do, said Pronko, with a 
beguiling tip of the fan, "is imitate a man imitating a woman. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
14-Year-Old Sets Her Wonders to Music 
</P>
<P>
She has been hard at work composing for six years, and now, at long last, Julie 
Yang has won her first major music award. 
</P>
<P>
Julie, of Westwood, was declared Southwest Division winner in the Junior High 
School classification of the Music Teachers National Assn./Columbia Pictures 
Publications Student Composition contest -- in effect, crowning Julie as the 
best young composer in a six-state area: Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada, 
New Mexico and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Her winning composition was "Six Variations of Wonders," written for solo piano 
-- "because I play the piano myself." (She also plays cello with the Junior 
Philharmonic Orchestra of California, sings soprano with the Los Angeles 
Mandarin Baptist Youth Choir and dabbles enthusiastically in a variety of 
pursuits, from the sciences to "general school life.") 
</P>
<P>
Julie, who was born in Taiwan and came to the United States in 1984, describes 
her composition as limning "the different stages of my life, since I was 4 -- 
kind of like flashbacks of feeling, remembering how I felt. As a child, you 
really don't know what's coming up. Not that every period is a 'wonder,' but in 
a different sense, you're always wondering." 
</P>
<P>
Has Julie, then, wondered about life as a professional musician? "Not 
necessarily," she says. "I enjoy many things. Music certainly is a way of 
expressing myself, but not the only way. I may well go to UCLA -- that's where 
my brother is -- but I really don't know what I'll be doing in the future. 
Remember, I'm not even 15 yet." 
</P>
<P>
One More Time, Counselors, From the Top 
</P>
<P>
They're human after all. Then again, one might have expected a lighter side to 
men and women who spend so much time at the bar. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, the Orange County Bar Assn.'s Theater Wing presented "Law 
Revue '89," a musical comedy, in the Chapman College Auditorium, a show that 
demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that judges too can tap dance. 
</P>
<P>
"You understand," lawyer William Jackson said before the show, "that it's to 
raise money for charity, for the Orange County Bar Foundation's community 
programs. But at the same time, it is great fun." 
</P>
<P>
"We take a lot of (San Francisco lawyer) Morris Bobrow's musical parody, then 
we intersperse it with talent of our own," said attorney Karen Taillon, 
theater-wing chair. "We have an all-attorney barbershop quartet doing 'Law and 
Motion Here I Come,' 'Justice Rose,' a few others. The chorus line is all 
judges, and yes, they do tap-dance. There's a number called 'Brush Up Your 
Motions' and another one: 'Mamas, Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Lawyers.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Alas, no "Sue City Sue" or "Bill Bailiff Won't You Please Come Home," but there 
was a series of comedy sketches whose chronology, as seen by lawyers, was 
telling: "Singles in America," "Our Love," then "Visitation Blues. 
</P>
<P>
"There's another benefit to a show like this," Jackson said: "getting judges 
and commissioners and attorneys together in a social venue. Remember, sometimes 
we too have an adversarial relationship. We don't always get along with those 
guys either."

HISTORY IS JUST A HANDSHAKE AWAY WITH FRIENDLY FRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES HILLINGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MACKINAW CITY, Mich. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you saw Old Fred and didn't know him you would think he was one of the 
legion of America's homeless, a drifter perhaps. But you can't always tell a 
book by its cover. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Litzner -- known to everyone in this area as Old Fred -- wears a well-worn 
flannel shirt, old trousers, a seedy black coat and faded black hat, walks with 
a cane and always carries a shopping bag. His get-up belies his standing as an 
extraordinary historian. 
</P>
<P>
For 20 years, Litzner, 75, has lived in a tiny house filled floor to ceiling 
with hundreds of his handwritten notebooks, with boxes brimming over with 
historical records, with books and artifacts. He has no telephone or TV. 
There's hardly room for him to move about in his one-room modest dwelling. 
</P>
<P>
Old Fred is the best-known character in the small towns along the byways and 
highways in the sparsely populated counties where Lakes Michigan and Huron come 
together separating Michigan's Upper Peninsula from the Lower. 
</P>
<P>
"He waves at everybody, talks to everybody. Tell him your name and if you're 
from around here he'll tell you all about your family, tell you things about 
your ancestors you have never heard before. He's uncanny," said Joe Nowak, 48, 
a long-time Michigan state trooper. 
</P>
<P>
"Old Fred hitchhikes everywhere. He doesn't have a car. He's a roamer. 
Everybody picks him up. He's such a friendly, fascinating person. He's a 
walking encyclopedia. And, he traces everyone's family tree," said Janet 
Peterson, 33, executive secretary of the St. Ignace Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"The Ballad of Old Fred," published in the St. Ignace News, captures the 
essence of this remarkable man. It begins: 
</P>
<P>
 This is a story of a man named Fred 
</P>
<P>
 It's true and correct and should be said, 
</P>
<P>
 For he's not a bum or tramp as seems, 
</P>
<P>
 But a gentle old man who shares his dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Ain't that something though, Old Fred, 
</P>
<P>
 You keep a record of everybody, living and dead. 
</P>
<P>
 You knew my uncles, my aunts and even my paw; 
</P>
<P>
 Tell me their life, then say "good luck to ya." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Litzner grew up on a Michigan farm. His grandparents came to Michigan from 
Germany in 1885 after seeing signs painted on barns urging Germans to migrate 
to Michigan, where the land was good, plentiful and almost free. The Germans 
came in droves. 
</P>
<P>
Litzner graduated from high school in Saginaw. He farmed. But history was his 
avocation, his passion, his obsession. He purchased historical items at 
auctions and presented them to universities, museums, historical societies. 
</P>
<P>
"He is known to historians at the University of Michigan, at Michigan State, to 
historians and librarians throughout Michigan. He is a most extraordinary 
person," said James Moody, 53, professor of history at Lake Superior State 
University, Sault Ste. Marie. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to sit down with Mr. Litzner for six months and tape everything 
he knows. He is a tremendous resource. I have just completed a paper for the 
National Academy of Sciences on the history of railroads in the Upper Peninsula 
and the industries that grew up with the advent of the railroads. 
</P>
<P>
"Fred knows more about this than anyone I know. He knows the players. He knows 
the location of dozens of sites of towns that no longer exist. He can take you 
right to them. He has a tremendous collection of books and artifacts not only 
in his humble home but in storage that he maintains. He talks to everyone. He 
is as close to St. Francis of Assisi as anyone I have ever met." 
</P>
<P>
Katherine Punch, 72, a librarian at the Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada, 
library from 1937 to 1981 and on the library board ever since, is one of 
numerous librarians throughout Michigan and Ontario befriended by Litzner over 
the years. 
</P>
<P>
"He knows history on a personal basis. He does so much for history. I've never 
met anyone quite like him. For 25 years he has been hitchhiking to our library 
from his home, bringing information to add to our historical collection," Punch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't hear from him for months. Then one day he appears. He searches out 
small clues. Anything he runs across pertaining to the history of our area he 
collects, saves, then presents to us -- papers, maps, photo documents. He has 
added immeasurably to our collection." 
</P>
<P>
Litzner sends information to libraries as far away as Switzerland, Germany and 
Sweden about immigration to Michigan that might be of interest to them. He 
often hitchhikes to Detroit, Lansing, Ann Arbor and other places in Michigan to 
do his research. 
</P>
<P>
"He is an incredible human being. He digests everything. He has an uncanny 
memory. He does all sorts of wonderful things for so many people out of the 
kindness of his heart," said Donald Heldman, director of archeology at the 
Mackinaw City State Historic Park. 
</P>
<P>
Ft. Michilimackinac in Mackinaw City, population 900, was built by the French 
in 1715, and occupied by the British from 1761 to 1781. Litzner is an authority 
on the period and has closely followed Heldman's excavations at the site. 
</P>
<P>
"You would think Old Fred was dirt poor, a lost soul in his old clothes 
carrying a shopping bag, hitchhiking all hours of the day and night. On the 
contrary, he is brilliant. He speaks beautiful German. He is an historian's 
historian," Heldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 So, if you see Old Fred standing by the road, 
</P>
<P>
 And, it's starting to rain, it's windy and cold, 
</P>
<P>
 Pick him up, don't hesitate, 
</P>
<P>
 For the stories he's got are really great. ...

COUSTEAU WATCH: CHARTING A MISSION ON ENVIRONMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN-MICHEL COUSTEAU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The animal was as slippery as water itself. As I watched the giant otter glide 
easily through the river, I felt awkward, even in my sleek diving suit. 
</P>
<P>
Before me, the supple mammal swirled, totally at home in these murky Amazon 
streams. Then the animal approached my father and me. Although able to claw a 
human to death, instead she nuzzled us, her wet nose across our faces and warm 
tongue across our cheeks. The touch was unforgettable, the moment perhaps 
irreplaceable. For these animals, slaughtered and hunted for their magnificent 
pelts, are practically extinct. 
</P>
<P>
We had come upon this otter cramped in a tiny zoo and she became a visitor on 
Calypso until she could be safely released into the wild again. 
</P>
<P>
Our time with her was unplanned, unexpected, special to us -- one of the 
countless magnificent moments that celebrate life on our planet. 
</P>
<P>
As we begin the Cousteau Watch, we hope to share such moments as these. And we 
hope to explore their meaning. 
</P>
<P>
When my father first began undersea exploration in the 1930s, the ocean was the 
nearest frontier. When he co-invented the aqualung in 1943, this frontier 
became accessible as never before. No human had yet truly explored this deep, 
silent world, the world without sun. Yet this was not a sea of darkness, but a 
sea of magic. Awe became a steady companion, for here he found indescribable 
beauty -- the perfect swirl of the nautilus shell, the lithe underwater 
maneuver of the seal, the tentacle ballet of the octopus, the microscopic 
majesty of the coral polyp building colossal reefs. 
</P>
<P>
Here was a brilliant cornucopia of life we had not imagined. Since then, this 
realm has changed forever -- for better and for worse. 
</P>
<P>
We have stampeded the oceans, pillaging the wealth of fish and aquatic life. 
And we have turned the seas into a dumping ground for wastes of all kinds. No 
matter where we dive today, we are hard-pressed to find the sublime richness 
and diversity of life that was the Mediterranean Sea when my father first 
tested the aqualung. 
</P>
<P>
The world has moved on, and so must environmental awareness. It is no longer 
enough to lobby on behalf of national parks, wilderness conservation, 
endangered species. We can no longer act as though humans are somehow apart 
from the cycles of life. The more we travel, the more we see how humans too are 
endangered by their activities. 
</P>
<P>
Smog alerts have become common in major cities throughout the world. At Love 
Canal in the United States, we have seen the spectacle of evacuations of 
residents whose houses were contaminated by oozing toxic substances. 
</P>
<P>
We have seen the return of cholera and hepatitis due to the eating of shellfish 
spoiled by human sewage. In the summer of 1988, hospital debris floated back to 
beaches near New York, Seattle and the Great Lakes. Forces have been set into 
motion that are dangerously warming the Earth. In inflicting on the land and 
ocean perhaps all they can take, human society is putting itself at risk. 
</P>
<P>
Calypso and our wind-powered ship Alcyone now circle the globe on separate 
expeditions, examining not only the ocean environment, but other elements -- 
social, economic, political -- that affect the quality of life on our planet. 
We film and we seek to understand what we see. We record things as they are and 
speculate about things that could have been, and may still be. We try to find 
the subtle matrix that governs us all, the links between bird and branch, sound 
and silence, preservation and power, threat and threatened -- the difference 
between mere existence and life. 
</P>
<P>
Our ships are small, and there is little formality. We eat together, work 
together and share tasks together. Including watch. 
</P>
<P>
We not only need to keep our eyes open for navigational safety, despite 
sophisticated equipment, but also because we are explorers in a world already 
largely explored. The new becomes harder to discern. 
</P>
<P>
Of course we have itineraries and plans, but often the most indelible moments 
are the serendipitous, the random, when we simply watch and wait. 
</P>
<P>
Off Papua New Guinea, in the summer of 1988, Calypso and Alcyone met for the 
first time in several years. It was a reunion of our forces and our 
aspirations, an extension of the first moment 40 years ago when we beheld the 
undersea universe for the first time. The ships floated on the glass of clear 
blue water off a beautiful tropical island. We were guests in paradise, and I 
felt small in the face of modern forces, natural and unnatural, that both 
create and destroy our dreams. 
</P>
<P>
As we continue to explore, we hope to share with our readers our experiences, 
wonder and worries; to re-create in print, before our films can be finished, 
both our fleeting and our lasting memories. 
</P>
<P>
In the Cousteau Watch, we will journey in adventure and inquiry, sharing the 
touch of the otter, our journeys across the water planet, and our rediscovery 
of Earth, this most precious world.

ERMA BOMBECK: THE BEDROOM SHOULD COME OUT OF THE CLOSET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Erma Bombeck 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How's this for a seduction scene? You slip into something satiny with a 
spaghetti strap that falls from the shoulder. As you approach the bed (with the 
perfumed sheets), your foot becomes entangled in a mound of paper being spewed 
out by a fax machine, causing you to bump into the filing cabinet and send the 
keyboard to the word processor crashing to the floor. If that doesn't take the 
fire out of your desire, it'll at least slow you down. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't know bedrooms had "gone corporate" until I complained in a column 
about the exercise bicycle at the bottom of my bed. The mail that followed 
enlightened me. 
</P>
<P>
According to one writer, her bedroom is so full of business machines, people 
ask, "Who's your decorator? Shearson Lehman Hutton?" Another one who complained 
of romance between the sheets (fax, that is) said she considered draping 
herself in all that paper and becoming a Turkish belly dancer. 
</P>
<P>
One disenchanted wife said she and her husband don't have exercise equipment, 
but they are part of a new trend that brings a microwave oven and a small 
refrigerator to their bedroom for those late snacks of popcorn and pizza while 
they're watching television. Another woman offered to trade me my exercise 
bicycle for the large German shepherd dog draped over the foot of her bed every 
night like a "snoring quilt." 
</P>
<P>
It has become apparent that the sexy mirrored bedroom that television depicts 
as the last stop before ecstasy isn't a parking lot for sex at all, but a gym . 
. . an office . . . a kitchen . . . or a kennel. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a challenge for you. Go to your bedroom and take a look. Is this a room 
that sets a tone for intimacy, passion and adventure? Or is it decorated in the 
following decor? 
</P>
<P>
Early Cloth World: A dress form, sewing machine and swatches of material 
dominate the room. The shag rug on the floor contains some decorating surprises 
-- straight pins that go straight through a bare foot. 
</P>
<P>
Neo-Laundry: My personal favorite is a bedroom where the bed is dramatically 
underplayed. It is buried under a mountain of clothes to be folded. Every night 
the clothes are taken off the bed and dumped on chairs. Every morning, the 
clothes are returned to the bed. 
</P>
<P>
Collectible Primitives: Many bedrooms have "carport looks." They hold items 
destined to become antiques. These rooms are stacked with plants that need 
repotting, a carton containing toilet tissue purchased on sale, bicycles for 
storing, etc. 
</P>
<P>
One woman said her and her husband's bedroom held a huge TV screen and a wall 
of videotapes of football games past. I'll bet even Alexis on "Dynasty" never 
made love with the Notre Dame fight song playing in the background!

'NOSTALGIC APPEAL' OF THE AK-47 DRAWS FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So the AK-47 semiautomatic assault rifle has "nostalgic appeal"? ("In Defense 
of the AK-47" by Patrick Mott, Feb. 24). What about the nostalgic appeal to 
their families of children killed by the AK-47 and similar weapons? 
</P>
<P>
But then we should remember that "Guns don't kill people; people kill people." 
Why, then, are we concerned to reduce nuclear arsenals? Nuclear missiles don't 
kill people; people kill people. Why are we concerned to eliminate the weapons 
of chemical and bacteriological warfare? Chemical and bacteriological weapons 
don't kill people; people kill people. In short, no weapons kill people; only 
people kill people. But people without weapons designed exclusively for killing 
would find it more difficult to do so.

MONUMENTAL DILEMMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kudos for Allan Parachini's fine article on Greene and Greene ("Living the 
Legacy," Feb. 19). This excellent account of the "problems of owning and living 
in an art object" illustrates a dilemma we have recently decided to address. 
This institute (Institute for Survival through Design, formerly the Richard J. 
Neutra Institute) has created a project titled the Preservation of the Urban 
Historic Heritage. 
</P>
<P>
We are conducting research into possible incentives for owners of such 
properties to find reasons to preserve them in their original spirit, and in 
some form find support from the public sector, which tends to put them on 
lists, only to then let them fend for themselves and put impediments in the way 
of freedom of action and a pall on resale. 
</P>
<P>
A quick view of the current list of "monuments" of the Cultural Heritage 
Commission of the City of Los Angeles, reveals too large a number of sites 
where some important structure once stood. The idea here is not just to put 
things on lists, but to secure their preservation. At present, being listed 
basically buys a one-year moratorium on demolition; not a sufficient result for 
the amount of effort involved. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty saved of 200 Greene and Greenes is not a meritorious record.

HITTING NAIL ON THE BISHOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For those of us who have grown weary of reading totally irrelevant accounts of 
what prominent women in the news are wearing, it was indeed inspiring to learn 
from Betty Cuniberti ("The Bishop of Controversy," Feb. 15) that Barbara 
Harris, the first female bishop of the Episcopal Church, has "manicured mauve 
nails." 
</P>
<P>
Next will we know whether Bishop Tutu bites his and the Pope prefers clippers 
to scissors? What is the View section calling this series: Manicures and 
Morals? Christianity and the Cuticle?

AMNESTY COURSE MAY COME TO END FOR LACK OF FUNDS

<TEXT>
<P>
Irene Facio faced the 46 Latino men and women, and cheerfully led them in a 
slow chant extolling the virtues of the toothbrush. 
</P>
<P>
Holding up a drawing of the instrument, Facio urged the students in the crowded 
classroom to repeat in unison: "The toothbrush keeps our teeth clean!" 
</P>
<P>
She then took them through a dozen more practice sentences that helped 
familiarize the students with other household vocabulary words, such as salt, 
coffee, food, store and clothes. 
</P>
<P>
"Muy bien," she congratulated the class members -- many of whom spoke no 
English. "You are all getting better." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Government Funding 
</P>
<P>
Because of a lack of funds, however, the students may be the last to enroll in 
a four-week class in rudimentary English, government and U.S. history that the 
Bell council of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) offers to 
amnesty applicants. 
</P>
<P>
"We're out of money," complained Bell LULAC head Rudy Garcia, who has been 
running the classes without any government funding since last November. "These 
people want to continue to come to class, but they won't be able to if the 
state doesn't give us money." 
</P>
<P>
The once-illegal immigrants who have applied for amnesty need to take at least 
40 hours of such class instruction, one of the last requirements for applicants 
to gain U.S. citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
The Latino community-based organization has certified more than 400 amnesty 
applicants who have attended the classes, which are held at the Cudahy Social 
Services Center. About 250 are enrolled in day and evening classes, and another 
450 are on a waiting list, Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Missed the Deadline 
</P>
<P>
But state Department of Education officials have rejected the council's funding 
request, saying the organization was one of a handful of nonprofit agencies in 
the state that filed after the department ran out of money allocated for 
amnesty classes. The education department administers the state's portion of 
the $1.8 billion allocated by the federal government over a five-year period 
for amnesty classes. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, hundreds of eligible amnesty applicants on waiting lists from 
Bell, Bell Gardens, Maywood, Cudahy and Huntington Park would have to look 
elsewhere for classes. Although most public schools in the area offer amnesty 
classes, many also have waiting lists, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The possible closure of the Bell LULAC classes comes at a time when lawmakers, 
community leaders and educators, citing a lack of classroom space and proper 
organization, are estimating that thousands of Latinos who have applied for 
amnesty nationwide may not fulfill the class requirement in time. 
</P>
<P>
Applicants have 16 months from the time their amnesty application is approved 
by U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service officials to find a class that 
teaches them civics and English proficiency. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very concerned that the bottleneck that's been created by the lack of 
funding is detrimental to the amnesty program," said Beverly Hunter-Curtis, a 
staff member for state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles). Torres is chairman of 
the Joint Committee on Refugee Resettlement, International Migration and 
Cooperative Development. 
</P>
<P>
The Bell LULAC council has relied on local private donations to pay for office 
space, utilities and teaching materials, Garcia said. The classes offered by 
the Bell LULAC council are approved by the INS, and Garcia argues that he 
should qualify for the $500 per student that other community-based 
organizations receive. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said that even though he received $1,200 last month from local business 
owners, he does not have money to pay the five full-time staff members who 
teach the classes, fill out the necessary paper work and occasionally accompany 
applicants to the local INS office once they complete the class. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sought $1 Million 
</P>
<P>
The teachers have been conducting the classes on a voluntary basis until the 
organization's fiscal problems could be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia's problems with the state Department of Education began early last fall 
when he applied for state funding. Based on an enrollment projection of 2,000 
students, Garcia asked for $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said state education officials lost his original application, then told 
him when he reapplied in late December that his application was submitted too 
late. He said he was told no more money was available in the fiscal year that 
ends in June. 
</P>
<P>
"It was incompetence," Garcia said. "We waited and waited, but never heard 
about (the original application)." Garcia also said that education department 
officials did not list the Nov. 1 deadline to submit a funding request, a claim 
that education officials dispute. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised when they said there was a deadline," Garcia said. 
Hunter-Curtis said a number of other organizations -- including some that did 
receive funding -- have said that they were unaware of a deadline. "We were 
never really clear ourselves that there was a deadline," Hunter-Curtis said. 
</P>
<P>
John Schaeffer, head of amnesty funding for the state education department, 
said he could not comment on whether the state had lost the original 
application. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Up to 15 Groups Lost Funds 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, the Bell LULAC had applied much later than most other 
organizations, and was not the only organization that lost out by applying for 
money past the November deadline. 
</P>
<P>
"By November, it started getting tough," Schaeffer said, saying that the 
deadline had been extended a few weeks to allow new providers to get funding. 
Between 10 and 15 organizations eventually had to be denied funding, he 
estimated. 
</P>
<P>
"It got to be ridiculous to keep on funding projects that came in very, very 
late," Schaeffer said. 
</P>
<P>
"Had we had the money, we would have funded (Bell LULAC)," Schaeffer continued. 
"We want all the providers we can get because there is a tremendous demand out 
there. We just came to the point that we were out of money." 
</P>
<P>
Schaeffer said that the department has argued for the past year that there 
would not be enough funding to support the need for classes. The $80 million 
that was allocated this year to class providers, including public school 
systems, was far short of the department's needs to provide class space for all 
applicants, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have said that we needed $50 million to $70 million more than that to make 
it through this year," Schaeffer said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bill Would Add $50 Million 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said that the organization "wasn't geared up to teach" until late 
summer. However, after deciding to open classes and receiving INS 
certification, Garcia said that he would have made the November deadline if the 
state had not lost the original application. 
</P>
<P>
Torres has authored a bill, now in the Senate Education Committee, that would 
provide an additional $50 million to fund amnesty classes. 
</P>
<P>
"No one should be denied full participation simply because there is not enough 
money," Torres said. "The agencies (providing money) have to get their act 
together to make sure that people will not be denied the opportunity to 
participate." 
</P>
<P>
A recent study found that 1.2 million of the nation's estimated 2 million 
amnesty applicants reside in California, with 51% living in Los Angeles County, 
said Joseph Flores, Los Angeles Community College District facilitator for 
amnesty programs. 
</P>
<P>
"It is clear now that the need is far greater than anticipated," Flores said. 
He added that 77% of amnesty applicants in the county are illiterate in 
English, and about 30% of those are illiterate in their native language. 
</P>
<P>
"The need for educating these people is obvious," Flores said. "But they want 
education. They are going after education like there's no tomorrow, taking 
whatever classes they can get."

LAND-SWAP DEAL GIVES HUMAN SERVICES ASSN. GREEN LIGHT ON CENTER

<P>
As a result of an unusual land swap, officials of the 49-year-old Human 
Services Assn. will go ahead with a long-awaited plan to build a combined 
senior housing and social services center along the banks of the Rio Hondo. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a long time coming," Susanne Sundberg, executive director of the 
association, said after the announcement that a 2.1-acre strip of John Anson 
Ford Park will be deeded to operators of the church-founded, nonprofit agency 
by April. The park is owned by the county. 
</P>
<P>
"We are really very happy that we can count on the property," Sundberg said 
about the plan to move the agency's headquarters from Ludell Street across town 
to the park site. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Serves 11,500 
</P>
<P>
The agency serves about 11,500 elderly and low-income residents in a dozen 
Southeast communities by providing transportation, meals, legal help and 
in-home services. 
</P>
<P>
Almost three years ago, HSA officials began searching for a new site after city 
officials rejected the agency's plan to expand its existing facilities under a 
$266,000 state grant. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said HSA's facility, owned by the Southern California Synod of 
the Presbyterian Church, is within the city's largest redevelopment project 
area. The residential properties in that project are earmarked for eventual 
conversion to a commercial district. 
</P>
<P>
The city rejection jeopardized the agency's grant money, which was to have been 
used by last April. Agency officials also feared that they might have to move 
out of Bell Gardens, where 31% of the agency's clients live. 
</P>
<P>
But at the urging of HSA's Rex M. Dye, the office of County Supervisor Edmund 
D. Edelman, the Presbyterian Church and Bell Gardens officials worked out a 
three-step land deal, which was outlined last week during the HSA's annual 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"In a country as rich as we are," Edelman told the HSA board at the meeting, 
"it doesn't make sense not to provide social services. People need help. They 
deserve to get it." 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the church will sell the HSA property to the Community 
Redevelopment Agency for $625,000, the fair market value under the state's 
condemnation laws. In turn, the county will sell the undeveloped section of the 
park to the Redevelopment Agency for a nominal fee. Then the Presbyterian 
Church will purchase the new parcel from the Redevelopment Agency to build a 
new social services facility. The park area's price will be determined after a 
series of Redevelopment Agency public hearings, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Presbyterian Church founded HSA in 1940. The agency, which operates with a 
$1.2-million-a-year budget, also receives funding from United Way and the Los 
Angeles County Area Agency on Aging. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Meeting of the Minds' 
</P>
<P>
"We were not sure that it (the land deal) would happen," said Dye, a former HSA 
director who retired last summer to coordinate the project. "But we finally had 
a meeting of the minds on this." 
</P>
<P>
State officials have also agreed to extend for another year the deadline for 
the agency to use the grant money. 
</P>
<P>
The construction funds available from the state grant and the profit from the 
Ludell Street sale should finance about 80% of the proposed new social services 
center, Dye said. The rest would have to come from fund-raising efforts.

RESCUER INVENTS BETTER WAYS TO SAVE LABOR, LIVES IN MOUNTAINS 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you have recently helped carry a 200-pound victim with a broken leg down a 
narrow, rocky trail, you probably owe one to Russell Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the days when being on a search-and-rescue team often meant tracking 
victims down in the wilderness, then using sheer muscle to haul them out, 
Anderson got to thinking. A longtime Sierra Madre Search and Rescue Team 
member, Anderson is fit but not particularly muscular, and he has a bad back. 
Hauling heavy loads in the mountains -- that's agony, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"Hit a narrow spot in the trail, and only two guys can carry the litter. It 
took a couple of gorillas," said Anderson, 56, a slim, talkative man, with 
short gray hair cut into what he calls an "Ollie North." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looked for Solutions 
</P>
<P>
So Anderson, who operates a tree service out of his Sierra Madre home, started 
looking for solutions. What if, Anderson wondered, he could fit a wheel to a 
standard Stokes litter and turn the wire stretcher device into a kind of 
backcountry wheelbarrow? Somebody had once tried rigging a bicycle wheel to a 
litter, of course. But it tended to veer out of control on the rough spots. 
Unless it was being used on a paved road, the device was useless. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson disappeared into the little machine shop he has equipped behind his 
garage, and, a few days later, he came out with the Russ Anderson litter wheel. 
It was a fat wheel from an all-terrain vehicle, about two feet in diameter with 
thick rubber cleats, and it was fastened to an aluminum clamp, which could be 
easily slipped onto the bottom slats of the litter. 
</P>
<P>
It worked phenomenally well, Anderson's admirers say. 
</P>
<P>
In the 11 years since Anderson developed the idea, the litter wheel has become 
an indispensable item in the arsenal of mountain rescue equipment. "We couldn't 
do without it," said Arnold Gaffrey, a Sierra Madre team member and a past 
president of the Mountain Rescue Assn., a national umbrella organization for 
rescue squads. "It's taken a back-breaking job and made it a do-able job." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aversion to Hard Labor 
</P>
<P>
Ever since he first fell in love with the wilderness about 40 years ago, 
Anderson has been combining a brilliant grasp of mechanics and an aversion to 
hard labor to come up with labor-saving or lifesaving mountaineering equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Six years ago, the Seattle Manufacturing Co. made a deal with Anderson, who 
never went past high school, to market his ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Now all Anderson has to do is gather in the royalties (modest ones, he insists) 
and come up with new ideas. 
</P>
<P>
They seem to come in a steady stream. "Every time I'm out there, either 
backpacking or working on a rescue operation, I'm always dreaming about how to 
make the equipment better or simpler," he said. "Any money I make is kind of 
secondary." 
</P>
<P>
Things seem to get miraculously transformed under Anderson's pensive gaze, 
fellow rescue team members say. An ice ax, a standard mountain climbing device, 
suddenly acquires a rubber hand grip at one end. The Stokes litter gets broken 
into two easily-packed parts that can be reattached in the field. A winch used 
for hauling victims up mountain sides is mounted on a custom-built platform. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Array of Pulleys 
</P>
<P>
By now, the pieces of equipment manufactured with the Russ Anderson stamp 
include an array of sturdy but lightweight mountaineering pulleys, an "edge 
roller" to reduce the friction on ropes being pulled over rocky outcroppings, 
and a specially modified "figure-8 descender," which helps to reduce accidents 
to climbers or rescuers while they are rappelling down ropes. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson builds the prototypes in his shop, which includes metal lathes and a 
milling machine, and ships them to Seattle for mass production. The products 
are sold either through catalogue orders or in mountaineering specialty shops. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been among the most influential innovators of technical rescue equipment 
in the United States," said Tom Vines, the Montana-based editor of Response 
Magazine, published by the National Assn. for Search and Rescue. "He's not only 
developed new technology but he's taken previously existing technology and 
brought it to the point where it's easier to use and safer for the user." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson reacts to such kudos with embarrassment. "You go to a national 
conference with him," said Steve Millenbach, president of the Sierra Madre 
rescue team, "and you hear people saying, 'God, you're Russ Anderson?' and Russ 
will say, 'Oh, me?' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consults His Friends 
</P>
<P>
Anderson often consults fellow team members and friends on his inventions, he 
acknowledges -- people like Norman Batterson, an aerospace researcher who 
belongs to the Altadena Search and Rescue Team. And he uses ideas that come 
from mountaineering or outdoorsman's lore, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've copied concepts that have been used for years," Anderson insists. 
</P>
<P>
Copied and modified. Take the figure-8 descender. This is a device designed to 
exert friction on a rope so that a climber, rappelling down a cliff or out of a 
helicopter, won't lose control of his descent. The problem with earlier 
versions of the device was that the rope tended to slip around the sides and 
lock into a knot called the girth hitch. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen it happen three or four times," Vines said. "It usually happens when 
your weight shifts while you're rappelling over a sharp edge, like a helicopter 
skid." The climber's only recourse is to shimmy back up the rope, taking his 
weight off the figure-8, and slip the rope back into position, often while 
dangling a hundred feet in the air. 
</P>
<P>
But Anderson built his own version of the figure-8, based on a concept 
developed in Great Britain. He put "ears" on the device, prongs which prevented 
the rope from slipping. "It added a degree of safety to the job that we never 
had before," Gaffrey said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Got Nature Bug Early 
</P>
<P>
Anderson got the nature bug as a teen-ager. One of his teachers in South 
Pasadena, Robert Franklin Leslie (who later achieved some renown as the writer 
of such children's nature books as "The Bears and I" and "In the Shadow of a 
Rainbow") invited him on a 220-mile trek along the John Muir Trail in the 
Sierra Nevada. It was an inspiring 24-day experience for the 16-year-old 
Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
"I got all fired up about mountaineering," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In those days, outdoor clothing was made of wool and cotton, instead of the 
tightly woven lightweight synthetics like Gore-Tex that outdoorsmen use 
nowadays. And mountaineering equipment tended to be unwieldy and burdensome. 
</P>
<P>
But Anderson was an innovator from the start. He and Leslie, using military 
surplus materials, built their own lightweight pack racks for the Sierra trip. 
"Those were probably some of the first aluminum pack racks," he said. "Too bad 
we didn't get a patent on them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rocket Test Technician 
</P>
<P>
Anderson graduated from the high school branch of Pasadena Junior College (now 
Pasadena City College), went to work for an assembly plant and ended up as a 
rocket test technician for Aerojet General in Azusa. 
</P>
<P>
In 1964 he joined the Altadena Search and Rescue Team. In 1975 he switched to 
the Sierra Madre team, in what has now been his hometown for 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was with Aerojet, there was always a lot of standing-around time," he 
said. "I always had some little project I was working on." 
</P>
<P>
Pretty soon, Anderson developed the reputation as a can-do sort of team member 
as well as a level head in rescue operations, said Miner Harkness, the 
59-year-old patriarch of the Sierra Madre team. "He's very calm and cool," 
Harkness said . "He just goes along at the same level. All hell can be coming 
down on you, and Russ'll be there." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anderson Tree Service 
</P>
<P>
In 1968, Anderson started Anderson Tree Service, most of whose operations are 
overseen today by his 30-year-old son Gary. "It's a lot more fun coming out 
here after a leisurely breakfast," said Anderson, sitting in his sunny back 
yard, with a cactus garden and citrus trees drooping with fruit, "and fiddling 
around in the shop than working on an 8-to-5 job. That would kill me." 
</P>
<P>
Running his own business has also given Anderson more time to respond to rescue 
calls. His house is about four blocks from the rescue team's garage and a short 
drive to the team's main field of operation, the San Gabriel Mountains. Because 
of his mechanical aptitude, Anderson has unofficially been placed in charge of 
the team's two vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, whose shop is stuffed with logs of rare wood that he collects while 
pruning trees, is working on some new mountaineering devices, he said. But for 
the moment, he is keeping them under wraps. The competition might be listening. 
"There's not a whole lot of competition," he said. "But there's some." 
</P>
<P>
His fellow team members wait with more than just a passing interest. "The 
things he comes up with are important stuff," Harkness said. "It just makes 
life a lot easier."

COMPANION OMISSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for writing about the strange omissions in the Oxford Companion to 
English Literature (Book Review, Feb. 12). 
</P>
<P>
While I realize that your comments were directed toward a comparison between 
the Oxford book and the Cambridge Guide to Literature in English, it might 
interest you to learn that there is no mention of Isabel Colgate and Roald 
Dahl, both proper British subjects as far as I know. This seemed so odd that I 
simply stopped looking for more quirkiness. 
</P>
<P>
Also, in Oxford's rush to drown us in printed words and imperil our forests, 
they have produced several volumes of collected articles such as the ones on 
female jazz singers that did not even dignify the effort with an index. I 
recall a time when such fine bookstores as the old Pickwick would not even 
order books such as this that came without an index. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, your comments were salutary and might, I would hope, help to bring this 
rampant spinning of words gently but firmly to heel.

Regularly each week, I read the entire Book Review section to an elderly friend 
who is blind. She can be a little testy. Three-fourths of the way through 
Richard Eder's "Richard Poor" Endpapers, she interrupted with, "Yes, yes. Let's 
stop before he says that reverses are proverbial." 
</P>

I obeyed willingly. It is a poor piece, clumsily arch.

The Endpapers column on flipped-over sayings, "The Proverbial Wisdom of Richard 
Poor" (Book Review, Feb. 5) was certainly thought-provoking. I found myself 
mentally wandering around picking up old saws and re-examining them. Many of 
the more explosive flipovers have already become hackneyed e.g. "Time wounds 
all heels!" 
</P>
<P>
Some sayings would have no effervescence if the flipover were not contained in 
the saying itself, as in "Winners never quit: Quitters never win!" or "It's not 
the size of the dog in the fight, but the size of the fight in the dog!" Or 
what about, "Clutching defeat from the jaws of victory"? 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, with a new man in the White House, we should not forget George 
Bush's flipover, "I can see the tunnel at the end of the light!" -- whatever 
that means.

<P>
On the advent of his father's mortal illness, Michael Lesy sets off to confront 
the subject of death, the "forbidden zone." 
</P>
<P>
"Our culture is permeated by images and accounts of death," Lesy writes, "but 
they are only fictions, the works of the imagination, counterfeits. The real 
thing is carefully hidden." 
</P>
<P>
Lesy travels across the United States interviewing pathologists, homicide 
detectives, undertakers, slaughterhouse workers as well as murderers, 
executioners and mercenaries, all of whom distance themselves from their work 
-- through humor, ritual, religion. 
</P>
<P>
Among the conversations Lesy relays, a Charleston undertaker tells him that 
Charles de Gaulle's protection against death by poisoning was to take a pinch 
of arsenic every day. "A little death every morning to live through the big 
one." From an AIDS physician, Lesy hears: "You die the way you live. There are 
very few last-minute transformations."

Thirty-two-year-old Rachel Kennedy, owner of a London bookshop, is 
self-sufficient, solitary. "I've learned how to be alone and to put a good face 
on it," she says. 
</P>
<P>
She becomes a frequent dinner guest at the home of her father's former 
accountant and his wife, Oscar and Dorrie Livingstone. Somehow Rachel concludes 
"that Oscar and Dorrie thought me a suitable companion for Heather," their 
grown daughter, and Rachel condescends to become her mentor. 
</P>
<P>
When Heather impulsively flies to Venice to marry the man she loves, Rachel 
follows her -- to reprimand her. Heather responds by saying that Rachel's own 
total control -- good manners masking disengagement -- amounts to a 
"mismanagement" of life. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Rachel admits her limitations: "To strike out and claim one's own 
life . . . even to embrace caprice, was, though monstrous, sometimes 
admirable." 
</P>
<P>
"What we are reading is . . . an allegorical fable between a false life of 
repression and a true life of risks and engagements," Hermione Lee wrote in 
these pages, calling "A Friend From England" a "harsh, dark fable."

Ada Cunningham (stage name Norma) finds refuge in the unlikely company of a 
lioness, an aging trapeze artist, a popcorn magnate and the remnants of a 
circus troupe near retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Her real family was no less eccentric than her current company. Her mother, 
Grace (who died when Ada was 8), was a newspaper columnist who fabricated some 
of her best stories, the most popular of which was about her prodigy daughter: 
Ada, she reported, could read and write both English and Latin by age 3 and 
play violin, piano and compose music. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Ada is partly handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
Her father, Reynard, a violinist for the Indianapolis Symphony, is committed to 
a sanitarium by the time Ada is 16. But the early music training that he indeed 
gave her finds her a place in the circus: composing and playing music on the 
steam calliope. 
</P>
<P>
Ada's memories of her past, as well as the secret that caused her to flee 
Richmount, Ind., are interwoven into the narrative of circus life. An 
entertaining first novel.

Ruthanne Lum McCunn has woven an enthralling work of fiction from the true life 
story of Lalu Nathoy (known later as Polly Bemis), a Chinese pioneer who 
settled the American Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
Lalu was her father's favorite, his qianjin, or "thousand pieces of gold." But, 
after his crop of winter wheat fails because of drought in 1871, he sells the 
teen-age Lalu to a band of raiding bandits for two sacks of soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
The bandit chief subsequently sells her to a brothel in Shanghai for 30,000 in 
taels. "Normally, I would not be able to buy a scrawny, dark-skinned girl with 
feet like dragon boats," the madam tells Lalu, "but today I have a special 
buyer who does not care about such things, someone who will take you to 
America." 
</P>
<P>
Traveling from San Francisco to Portland, Lalu is then brought by mule to the 
mining community of Warrens: Hong King, an aging Chinese saloon-keeper, has 
bought her to draw business, and renames her Polly. 
</P>
<P>
Later the white saloon-keeper next door, Charlie Bemis ("no one dares mess with 
him, he can keep a tin can dancing in the air with his six-shooter"), becomes 
her protector and eventually wins her from Hong King in a poker game -- and 
gives her her freedom.

RESTAURANT REVIEW: WARSZAWA'S MENU MAY BE DIFFICULT TO SAY, BUT FOOD IS EASY TO 
LIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maybe it's just panic that keeps me away from Warszawa. Maybe I'm just afraid 
I'll make a fool of myself with that unpronounceable Polish menu. (Hey, I'm 
kidding -- Polish is easy to pronounce. Take pstrag, the word for trout. All 
you have to do is remember that it rhymes with honk.) 
</P>
<P>
No, that's not the reason. I think my real problem is that somehow I only 
remember a couple of disappointing dishes. Bigos, for instance, a traditional 
stew of beef, bacon, sausage and sauerkraut in a sweetish sauce that has a long 
and glorious history in Poland -- a mighty rep, in other words -- and sounds as 
if it has to be stupendously hearty. Somehow, though, it has never knocked me 
out the way I expected. 
</P>
<P>
Or wolowina (pronounced voh-woh-VEE-nah, by the way), a sort of beef stroganoff 
with a peculiar starchiness about it. Or Warszawa's version of veal paprikash, 
the dauntingly spelled paprykarz cielecy (go ahead, give it a try: 
pah-PREE-kash cheh-LEN-tsy), which always tastes more like tomato soup than 
paprikash to me. 
</P>
<P>
Recently I went back to check Warszawa out again, with good cheer but not 
really expecting to rave. But, as it happens, I'm going to rave. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, to acknowledge the fact that most Americans don't know where to 
begin with this large and unfamiliar menu, Warszawa has started letting diners 
order half portions of two entrees for a single price (only a couple of dishes 
at the bottom of the menu are excluded). 
</P>
<P>
It was only because of this highly educational practice that I ever got around 
to trying kolduny: thumb-sized ravioli filled with rich, gamy ground lamb in a 
slightly sweet and very oniony broth. You really have to like lamb, but if you 
do, it's the heart's desire. 
</P>
<P>
I came back another time and had duck with apples (kaczka z jablkami), with a 
marvelous, complex spiciness to its skin, and zrazy, which are thin beefsteaks 
wrapped around a wonderful, rich filling of mushrooms and onions and served in 
cream sauce. I came back again and had stuffed cabbage with a sweet-sour 
paprika cream sauce and a pretty unexpected entree called placki ziemniaczane 
(get ready: PLAHT-ski zhem-nyah-CHAH-neh), amazingly smooth-textured potato 
pancakes served with cinnamon apples, spiced plums and sour cream. 
</P>
<P>
By the time I was through with Warszawa, I'd had just about every entree on the 
menu. I'd even had a couple of the dishes you can't order by half portions, 
like rather homey pork chops with heavy, crisp breading in cream sauce and a 
beefsteak with mild juniper flavoring (the traditional seasoning for wild boar) 
and tart lingonberry sauce on the side. 
</P>
<P>
And a couple of appetizers; yes, I got around to those too. The Warszawa salad 
is still an original combination that works spectacularly well: fresh 
sauerkraut, apples and carrots with a dash of dill. There's also a more subtle 
salad of red cabbage with bell peppers and walnuts. 
</P>
<P>
And there are homely appetizers like a split pea soup sprinkled with 
sharp-flavored bits of ham and pumpernickel croutons, and the frumpy 
old-fashioned sort of fanciness of a beef-and-carrot aspic, saved by the fact 
that it comes with staggeringly fierce horseradish. The wildest appetizer is 
sliwki w boczku (SHLEEVE-ki'v BOATCH-koo), more of the spiced peaches that come 
with the potato pancakes, only wrapped in bacon and baked like the world's most 
exotic rumaki. 
</P>
<P>
Rum walnut torte is the only dessert I remembered from Warszawa, but now I find 
I actually like a lot of others at least as well. Nalesnik z serem is a dainty 
sweet crepe filled with cream cheese flavored with lemon and vanilla, with 
stewed raspberries on the side, not exactly photogenic but very good. The hot 
apple tart, szarlotka (surely you recognize the French word charlotte in 
there), is simple but fresh-flavored. The best might well be the poached pear 
Solidarnosc, with vanilla cream and cranberry sauce representing the colors of 
the Polish flag. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, I think my biggest revelation about Warszawa was the unusual 
after-dinner drinks served in narrow, elegant glasses, like wisniowka (you've 
got it by now: veesh-NYOOF-kah), a cherry vodka with a surprisingly winy 
bouquet like old port and Madeira. Krupnik, despite a name that looks faintly 
rude in English, is a wonderful honey liqueur rather like Drambuie. 
</P>
<P>
I'm over my Warszawa block. Someday soon, I swear, I'll go back and have the 
losos z sosem szczawiowym. I don't even care what it is. 
</P>
<P>
Suggested dishes: sliwki w boczku, $5; Warszawa salad, $4; kolduny, $14.75; 
kaczka z jablkami, $17; poached pear Solidarnosc, $4.75. 
</P>

The British government assured novelist Salman Rushdie, ordered by Iran's 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to pay with his life for a book considered 
offensive to Muslims, of its unwavering support. Asked to comment on the 
Indian-born writer's fears that government backing was waning, Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher replied that "the government has not changed its position at 
all on this." In Tehran, Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani said it would be 
difficult to repair the diplomatic damage done by Rushdie's book, "The Satanic 
Verses." "Even if the apostate Rushdie is executed, if Britain apologizes or if 
the book is withdrawn, the rift remains part of a global arrogance plot," 
Tehran Radio quoted Rafsanjani as saying.

A Madera farm labor contracting firm accused of more than 330 violations of the 
1986 Immigration Control and Reform Act is the first agricultural business in 
the nation to be fined under the law, federal officials said. S&amp;A Farm 
Contractors of Madera was fined $153,250 for reportedly employing 27 illegal 
aliens who were arrested during Border Patrol sweeps in January, said J. 
William Carter, chief of the Border Patrol office in Livermore. Agents later 
reviewed employment verification forms and found that 246 of 399 forms on file 
at the firm were not completed, Carter said. An employer who knowingly hires an 
illegal alien can be fined from $250 to $10,000 per offense, and failure to 
maintain proper employment verification forms carries fines ranging from $100 
to $1,000, INS officials said.

 -- Lyn Paleo of the San Francisco AIDS Foundation doffs her hat to Roman 
Catholic school nuns for their frank and open discussion on the use of condoms 
to fight the deadly disease. Paleo says that while most people try to avoid 
talking about the C-word, as she refers to condoms, Catholic schools are 
playing an important educational role. "The nuns tell us: 'You tell them 
everything they need to know, whatever you need to say,' " Paleo said of the 
foundation teams that visit the high schools. "One nun said: 'We preach 364 
days a year about abstinence. You tell them what they need to know for the 
other day in case our preaching hasn't worked.' " Paleo added: "Condoms and 
condom use are the true cornerstones of preventing the transmission of the AIDS 
virus." But, she said, selling the idea is another matter.

 -- For now, rock star Madonna's new video doesn't stand a prayer of being 
shown on Italian television. Charges by the conservative Roman Catholic group 
Famiglia Domani that the video, "Like a Prayer," is blasphemous have led 
state-run RAI television to cancel plans to show the video on the program 
"Notte Rock" (Rock Night) this week. In the video, the singer witnesses an 
assault on a girl, and a black man is wrongly accused. Wearing a slip, Madonna 
enters a church, where she stands before a statue of a black saint. The face is 
that of the accused man. Madonna, moved by the statue-come-to-life, develops 
bleeding hands similar to the wounds of the crucified Jesus. She kisses the 
statue and tells the police the accused man is not guilty. Madonna's Italian 
record company, WEA, said it will temporarily suspend TV distribution of the 
video.

 -- Wait no more. A mere $1,720 will buy a rare find these days: Samuel 
Beckett's latest novella, entitled "Stirrings Still." Only 200 signed copies of 
the 83-year-old Nobel Prize-winning author's work are being printed in London 
right now, but a mass-market edition should be in U.S. stores in a couple of 
years. The book by the author of "Waiting for Godot" is a meditation on old age 
that one reviewer lauded as "another of Beckett's nihilistic mantras, best 
mumbled aloud." A sample: "A clock afar struck the hours and half-hours. The 
same as when among others Darly once died and left him. Strokes now clear as if 
carried by a wind now faint on the still air. Cries afar now faint now clear. 
Head on hands half hoping when the hour struck that the half-hour would not and 
half fearing that it would not. Similarly when the half-hour struck. Similarly 
when the cries a moment ceased. Or merely wondering. Or merely waiting. Waiting 
to hear." JAMES MARNELL

Anti-abortion demonstrators were hauled away by the busload from coordinated 
protests at women's medical clinics in three New England states. Arrests 
totaled more than 300, including two members of pro-choice groups that staged 
counter-rallies. Four busloads of demonstrators in Brookline, Mass., were 
booked on disorderly conduct charges. Other protests took place at abortion 
advocate Bill Baird's clinic in Boston; a Danbury, Conn., clinic, and at the 
Providence headquarters of Rhode Island Planned Parenthood. The simultaneous 
protests began at 7:45 a.m. at three Brookline clinics along a three-mile 
stretch of Beacon Street. "What we want to do is witness the life and so gum up 
the works (that) no longer is it possible to kill unborn children, so the legal 
system simply can't deal with the closing of the clinics. They can't arrest 
everybody," said Father David Mullen of St. Paul's Roman Catholic Church in 
Wellesley, a protest organizer.

Israeli soldiers blocked roads and turned back hundreds of Israeli peace 
activists hoping to meet and discuss peace with Palestinians in the occupied 
West Bank. But several hundred others sneaked through or were allowed to pass, 
organizers said. About 1,500 supporters of the Peace Now movement set out from 
four cities for Arab towns. Troops stopped three groups heading for Ramallah, 
Nablus and Beit Sahur, a Peace Now spokesman said, but others persuaded 
soldiers to let them visit two Arab villages near Nablus. Leaders of the 
Palestinian uprising had called on Arab residents to welcome Peace Now 
supporters "with open arms."

The Bush Administration is reviewing visa requests by two officials of the 
Palestine Liberation Organization and a West Bank Palestinian to attend a 
U.S.-Israeli-Palestinian conference in New York next weekend, the State 
Department said. A visa request for a fourth person, Bassam abu Sharif, a PLO 
spokesman, was apparently dropped after U.S. officials told the PLO it would be 
impossible. Dennis Harter, a State Department spokesman, did not identify the 
three visa applicants by name, but he referred to a Washington Post report that 
said they are posing a dilemma for the Administration over how to deal with the 
PLO.

The New York state Board of Parole said Bernhard H. Goetz must serve the full 
one-year prison sentence he got for illegally carrying the gun he used to shoot 
four teen-agers on a New York City subway in 1984. Releasing Goetz after just 
two months in jail "would deprecate the seriousness of the crime and undermine 
respect for the law," the board said in Albany. Monday was the earliest Goetz 
could have been released. Edward Elwin, the board's executive director, said 
the decision meant Goetz would have to serve his full one-year sentence, minus 
any time off for good behavior, unless he can persuade a court to overturn the 
board's ruling. Goetz, 41, was convicted on the gun charge but acquitted of 
attempted murder, assault and reckless endangerment charges. He began serving 
his sentence Jan. 13 .

IN MOURNING OVER THE LOSS OF A SMALL, UNTAMED PLACE OF SERENITY

Bulldozers are changing the configuration of the lumpy mounds alongside my 
road. So I know the end is near. 
</P>
<P>
I never see the rabbits anymore. After the bulldozers arrived, the rabbits 
would stand in the middle of the road, looking disoriented and bewildered, as 
if the bulldozers had already turned over their burrows. Now they're gone 
altogether. I don't see the gigantic heron anymore either, but I worry less 
about him. He seemed only a few giant wing flaps away from whatever new home he 
wanted to choose. 
</P>
<P>
I call it my road but it really isn't. It's the haunt of runners, fisherfolk, 
dog walkers and solitary, pensive types. But, as one of its most devoted 
admirers, it falls to me to write the eulogy for the road with no name. 
</P>
<P>
It's not even a road, really. It's a wide swath of dirt at the edge of Mission 
Bay, running from near the entrance to Fiesta Island out to the backside of Sea 
World. I first set foot on it 20 years or so ago while making a running loop 
around the bay. I was captivated immediately by the unpruned, untidy, untamed 
feel of the place. I began frequenting it and learning its moods. At dusk on my 
road, eye-filling sunsets bathe the bay in luscious orange light, or sometimes 
play peek-a-boo from behind massive sea-scented fog banks. That's heading west. 
Turning around out at Sea World and heading back east, I'd see the moon rising 
up from behind the museum in Presidio Park and glowing over the hills and the 
now-twinkling valley. In such a setting, serenity can't help but set in. 
</P>
<P>
There have been early mornings of biting winds, dusty middays and becalmed 
times when the splash of jumping fish was all that shattered the stillness. 
I've recuperated from a ruptured appendix there, untangled endless puzzling 
problems and collected myself in sundry ways over the years on that road. 
</P>
<P>
Now the road is being bulldozed out of existence. As I see it, my loss is 
incalculable. City officials would, I'm sure, console me by pointing out that 
no shopping mall is being installed there. Rather, of all things, it will be a 
park for the people. Sunsets, moonrises and fog banks will still be available. 
Whatever is the problem then? 
</P>
<P>
Well, for starters, it will no longer be a place to go and be scruffy. One will 
have to be a presentable member of the community. And the grounds will be 
presentable. There were never even any grounds out there before. Just misshapen 
humps and bumps, cracked and eroded by the magnificent elements. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, it will no longer be a place to be alone, to find peace. Kites, maybe. 
But not peace. 
</P>
<P>
This may sound picky, crabbing about our city being the recipient of a 
beautiful, manicured new park. But solitary places are vanishing from our city 
at an alarming rate. And something dire happens to the human spirit when all 
the secret places people go to, to sort things out and put them back together 
again, are bulldozed into oblivion (or commercial prosperity). The desecration 
of Mission Valley will be complete when the last visual refuge of greenness 
there, the Stardust Golf Course, is "upgraded" to a happy commercial place for 
the townfolk to stroll in and part with their cash. 
</P>
<P>
My mourning for the lost road is my mourning, regardless of any city planner's 
however valid justifications. It is too special a road to vanish 
un-memorialized. The rabbits' disappearance should not go unrecorded. And not 
just the rabbits' habitat was lost here. Our habitat was lost here. As our wild 
places diminish, we are diminished.

NO TIME TO STRETCH HOUSING DEFINITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven-year-old Antonio Rodriguez and his 5-year-old brother, Jairo, got their 
first bath last week in a real tub. They played for almost an hour in the warm 
water -- a real change from the cold, makeshift showers they were used to. 
</P>
<P>
Their mother, Paloma, cooked dinner on a gas range and got her first look at a 
dishwasher. No more campfire cooking or hauling water for cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
That night the boys and their parents slept on the carpet of their new 
two-bedroom apartment because they didn't have furniture. But it was a far cry 
from sleeping on the ground in illegal encampments, waiting for an eviction 
notice from the county Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
The apartments that the Rodriguezes and two other families moved into last week 
are among the approximately 600 low-income housing units administered by the 
city of Carlsbad. Paloma Rodriguez and her husband, Lorenzo Santos, will pay 
30% of their income for rent, and the rest will be paid through a federal 
housing program. 
</P>
<P>
This family's good fortune is heartwarming, but the joy is dimmed by the 
knowledge that thousands of other people in San Diego County are still waiting 
for decent, safe housing -- people like Alicia and Moises Sahagun and their 
five children, who pay more than half their income for a mouse-infested, 
substandard home. 
</P>
<P>
The Sahaguns are among the plaintiffs in a class-action suit filed by the Legal 
Aid Society of San Diego, which accuses the city of Carlsbad of improperly 
using low-income housing funds to build a senior citizen center and offices for 
the school district. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to take issue with such a laudatory project as a senior citizen 
center. But the worthiness of the center is not at issue. And whether the city 
of Carlsbad is following the letter of the law, while important, is not the 
central issue, either. 
</P>
<P>
What's being tested is the sincerity of the commitment to the spirit of the law 
and to low-income housing by Carlsbad and other cities. 
</P>
<P>
The state law in question requires that 20% of the additional property taxes 
generated by redevelopment projects be used to increase or improve low- and 
moderate-income housing, with the emphasis on low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
But many cities are accused of looking for every loophole or trying to stretch 
the definitions to avoid having to use the funds for low-income housing. 
Through the efforts of public-interest law organizations, many of those 
loopholes have been closed. Several lawsuits, such as the one filed by the 
Legal Aid Society against Carlsbad, are designed to keep the focus on 
increasing the supply of safe, low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
Carlsbad argues that the senior citizen center is designed to do just that. It 
says the center will encourage private developers to build low-cost senior 
citizen housing, even though there is no specific project waiting in the wings. 
Only a court can decide which side is right. 
</P>
<P>
But when the city estimates that it would take almost 3,400 low-income housing 
units to meet the need projected for 1991, and when only about 50 units were 
added from 1986 through 1988, when the health department is pushing homeless 
migrants from pillar to post, that is not the time to be stretching 
definitions. Rather, it is a time when every available housing dollar should be 
put toward meeting the basic human needs of families like the Rodriguezes and 
the Sahaguns.

AIDS EPIDEMIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After recently reading the Los Angeles Times' excellent editorial ("AIDS: Cool 
Reception," Feb. 20) about AIDS prevention programs, I was concerned that some 
readers may conclude that the AIDS epidemic among males with male partners has 
peaked and that the worst is over. That is far from the case. 
</P>
<P>
While some may take the position that behavioral changes prompted by education 
have drastically cut the rate of new infections among the gay population, 
changes in behavior demonstrated in select groups may not be typical of the 
population as a whole. Although some members of the gay population have adopted 
"safer sex" practices, thus reducing the risk of transmission of the human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), others continue to engage in high-risk behavior, 
as evidenced by newly diagnosed gonorrhea and syphilis cases in this 
population. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, more gay men will be diagnosed with AIDS during 1989 than during 
any previous year. Progression to disease and transmission to others continue. 
</P>
<P>
Accurately predicting the number of AIDS cases that will occur in San Diego 
County is useful as a tool. This tool permits better recognition on the part of 
health planners for the number of individuals who will be requiring hospital 
beds, social services and medical care. 
</P>
<P>
Detecting new trends such as the increase or decrease in the rate at which new 
cases occur is, likewise, important. However, one must be cautious in 
over-interpreting the results that are found. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS is a specific disease condition diagnosed after many years of silent 
infection with the HIV. In 1985 and 1986, it was felt that the interval from 
the time of the infection until disease expression was relatively brief. 
Likewise at that point, it was felt that only a minority of infected 
individuals would develop symptoms related to viral infection. 
</P>
<P>
As time has passed, we find that the vast majority of infected individuals will 
ultimately develop symptoms of illness related to HIV infection, but that it 
may take 7, 10, 15 or more years before symptoms of this infection are 
recognized. Treatment agents, such as AZT, have shown an increase in the 
interval before progression to the full criteria for AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom-line significance is that a slackening of the AIDS epidemic in San 
Diego County cannot be defined by noting small changes in the rate of increase 
in new cases. 
</P>
<P>
Continued emphasis on risk-reduction education and reinforcement of positive 
behavior change to reduce HIV transmission in all high-risk groups must be 
continued and repeatedly fostered. We cannot be complacent about the task of 
changing high-risk behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, we must be consistent and reinforce the need for maintaining behaviors 
that will eliminate HIV transmission risk, and continue to provide this 
education and reinforcement to all individuals reaching the age of sexual 
maturity.

DON'T FALL FOR SHAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recently you ran an editorial entitled "The Real Issue Is Students' Health." In 
that editorial it was opined that a previous attempt at establishing a health 
clinic failed at a San Diego high school because of "protests from the Roman 
Catholic Church and from some narrow-minded parents who objected to the 
possibility that the clinic might dispense birth-control information or 
devices." I was a member of the Advisory Committee of the San Diego Unified 
School District, and future funding, the role of school districts in solving 
social problems, the primacy of curriculum and an upcoming election had a part 
in the decision to forgo further exploration of the concept. 
</P>
<P>
Now a joint effort of city, county and school district officials, under the 
umbrella of "New Beginnings" is attempting a way of coordination of services 
and saving resources by non-duplication of effort. 
</P>
<P>
While such an effort must be applauded, it is unfortunate that the divisive 
issue of a school-based clinic has been introduced into the picture. It is 
truly in the best interests of the proposers of "New Beginnings" to clearly and 
quickly state that a school-based health clinic is not and will not be a part 
of their considerations. 
</P>
<P>
The example cited in the Feb. 19 editorial was informative but also misleading. 
It is true that parents may sign consent forms to specify which services their 
children may receive. It should also be known that access to reproductive 
health services may be obtained without parental consent. Thus, while your 
child may need your consent for an eye exam or medication, they can obtain a 
pregnancy test or birth-control devices without parental consent. 
</P>
<P>
Private funding of clinics is advanced as an important reason for utilizing 
school-based health clinics since it saves district funds and offers expanded 
services without direct cost to the district. 
</P>
<P>
The other side of this truth is that private funding is usually a combination 
of foundation grants, federal or state funds and donations most often with a 
fixed percentage match of dollars or resources from the school district. 
Several of the large foundations supporting school-based health clinics require 
family planning services as a part of the range of services for funding 
purposes (i.e. no birth-control, no support). The federal and state funds are 
tax-collected monies supporting the Office of Family Planning or the 
implementation of the Adolescent Pregnancy Planning Act (hardly what I call 
private funds). 
</P>
<P>
If the real issue is students' health, why doesn't the Board of Education 
target certain at-risk schools and generate an expanded health care program 
with their school nurses? If the real issue is students' health, why hasn't 
there been a greater coordination of health care prior to this time? Health 
care for the poor is a shambles nationwide; indigent health care in our county 
is a disaster. Medicare providers are bailing out of service delivery daily. 
</P>
<P>
To presume that a health clinic on or near a school campus will resolve health 
care problems is naive at best. Referrals for service after the screenings at 
the campus clinic must be dealt with and funded. Access to health care is 
desperately needed, but let us not fall for a sham delivery system.

KINGS TROUNCE THE FLYERS, 6-2, IN A WILD ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until Wayne Gretzky's line got warmed up in the second period, the Kings' game 
against the Philadelphia Flyers Saturday night was looking to be a defensive 
matchup featuring the Kings' new goalie, Kelly Hrudey, and another of the 
National Hockey League's best, Philadelphia's Ron Hextall. 
</P>
<P>
Defense and fisticuffs were all the rage until Gretzky took over in the last 
half of the second period. After that, the defense dropped off a little but the 
fisticuffs didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, who had scored the Kings' only goal in the first period, added assists 
on all four of the goals scored in the second period, then scored the only goal 
of the third period on a breakaway as the Kings beat the Flyers, 6-2, before 
another sellout crowd of 16,005 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
As Gretzky scored the Kings' final goal, Jay Wells, who was chasing him up the 
ice with no chance of catching him, demonstrated the brutality level of the 
game by reaching out with his stick and swinging away with a solid, two-handed 
slash that caught Gretzky in the left elbow. As the puck went into the net, 
Gretzky doubled over, holding his left arm. He was helped from the ice by 
trainer Pete Demers and never returned to the game. 
</P>
<P>
It had long since been decided, anyway. There were just more punches to be 
thrown. At the end there were six Flyers on the ice swinging at five Kings. In 
the final tally -- a tally that continued on the back of the official score 
sheet -- the Kings were assessed 27 penalties for a total of 110 minutes and 
the Flyers 24 penalties for 104 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
But, as Gretzky said as he was shrugging off the "not overly hard slash" and 
trying to shift the focus: "It was a win we needed desperately." 
</P>
<P>
After a miserable trip (in which they went 1-3-1), the Kings need every point 
they can get in their battle with Edmonton for second place in the Smythe 
Division and home ice in the first round of the playoffs. With the victory, the 
Kings' record improved to 34-27-6. That's exactly the Oilers' record. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew it would be a physical game," Gretzky said, and although a lot of 
Kings ended up bruised and battered, there were no serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
King defenseman Dean Kennedy, who had a mean-looking bump swelling over his 
right eye, argued that the positive side of all the fighting was that nobody 
got cut with a swinging stick. Limit the fighting to fists and everyone lives 
to fight another day. 
</P>
<P>
It was defenseman Dale DeGray who was trying to get at Wells after the slash at 
Gretzky. Asked how he felt about seeing his teammates stick up for him like 
that, Gretzky said: "It's just a reminder that whether it's myself or any other 
player, when the game is 6-1 with just a few minutes left, those plays will not 
be tolerated." 
</P>
<P>
It was Hrudey's first start for the Kings at the Forum, and he was brilliant, 
stopping 28 shots after getting beaten by Rick Tocchet on the Flyers' first 
shot of the night, just 20 seconds into the game. He also gave up a late goal 
to Dave Poulin. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky had tied the score, 1-1, at 16 minutes of the first period, and then it 
was a standoff for 14 minutes during which the game was slowed by the series of 
fights. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky set up the first goal of the four-goal series in the second period by 
holding the puck behind the net -- and holding it and holding it -- because the 
Flyers were holding up his teammates, giving him nowhere to pass the puck. Tim 
Watters was tied up at the left post, and Mike Krushelnyski was tied up at the 
right post. Finally, Gretzky skated around to the front and took the shot 
himself. Mike Allison and Krushelnyski both jumped at the rebound, and the puck 
went in off Krushelnyski's stick at 10:15. 
</P>
<P>
Less than three minutes later, at 13:12, Krushelnyski jumped on the rebound of 
a shot by Watters and backhanded it past Hextall as he skated across the front 
of the net. 
</P>
<P>
And just 43 seconds later, Gretzky did his thing behind the net again, only 
this time Allison was free to take the pass, and he pocked it into the right 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
In two consecutive shifts, the Gretzky-Allison-Krushelnyski line had scored 
three goals. 
</P>
<P>
The final goal of the period was scored by Bernie Nicholls, who ended his 
seven-game drought by getting the puck behind Hextall and into the right corner 
as the finishing touch of his two-on-one breakaway, Nicholls racing up the 
right side, passing the puck back and forth with Gretzky, who was racing up the 
left side.

THIS PROSPECT CATCHES ON QUICKLY

The Minnesota Twins thought enough of Derek Parks' potential as a catcher that, 
even though he had played just six games at the position in high school, they 
made him the 10th amateur drafted in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
That summer, in his first pro season, Appalachian League managers named Parks 
the league's top major-league prospect. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the publication "Baseball America" chose him as the Midwest League's 
top prospect and the best catching candidate in baseball's entire minor-league 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Southern League managers picked Parks as the league's best 
non-pitching prospect, best defensive catcher and catcher with the best arm. 
</P>
<P>
And at the most recent winter meetings, Twins general manager Andy MacPhail 
repeatedly rejected any deals in which Parks' name was mentioned, including one 
that could have brought Dave Winfield from the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone seems to think Derek Parks is something special -- except for Derek 
Parks. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think about that stuff. And I don't care," says Parks, who is taking 
part in his first major-league spring training camp. "If you think about things 
like that, you'll just start putting pressure on yourself to live up to 
everybody else's expectations." 
</P>
<P>
Parks says he has "a ton of work to do" before he can even think about catching 
in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to work on the fundamentals, the mechanics, calling the pitches," he 
says. "I have to work on the proper way to receive the ball, getting 
comfortable in a stance. There's a million things." 
</P>
<P>
A million things are a lot for a 20-year-old to have on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a young catcher with a lot of tools and an above average arm who also 
swings the bat well," Twins bullpen coach Rick Stelmaszek says. "The important 
thing for him is to not try to be Superman." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Parks isn't the Man of Steel, but he's not exactly a 98-pound weakling, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
"He's put together well," Stelmaszek says of the 6-foot, 205-pounder. "He's a 
solid, strong kid. You'd never guess that he's only 20." 
</P>
<P>
But he is. And his catching career is much younger than that. 
</P>
<P>
"In high school, I pitched and played third base until right near the end of my 
senior year," Parks says. "I don't know what the Twins saw in me as a catcher. 
I still don't exactly know." 
</P>
<P>
What they saw was a tremendous athlete with tremendous potential. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior at Montclair (Calif.) High School, he batted .440 with six homers 
and 23 RBI in 24 games. In addition, Parks went 11-1 with a 1.25 ERA and 100 
strikeouts in 79 2-3 innings as a right-handed pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
During his three minor-league seasons, his offense slipped a bit as he 
concentrated on catching. 
</P>
<P>
In rookie ball in 1986, he batted .237 with 10 homers and 40 RBI in 62 games. 
The next year, at Class A Kenosha, Wis., he hit .247 with 24 homers and 94 RBI 
but struck out 111 times. And last season, at Class AA Orlando, he had a .235 
average with seven homers and 42 RBI. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not concerned with my offense, really," Parks says. "It's got to be 
defense first and then hitting. 
</P>
<P>
"The only offensive thing I want to work on this year is not trying to muscle 
everything out of the park. I hit 24 homers in A ball and thought I was some 
big power hitter. That hurt me last year." 
</P>
<P>
On defense, "I'm changing all the time," he says. "Changing my stance. Changing 
the way I catch left-handers. Changing the way I receive the ball. I've got to 
get comfortable back there." 
</P>
<P>
For their part, the Twins are quite comfortable with their No. 1 non-pitching 
prospect. 
</P>
<P>
"Suffice it to say that we're very, very careful when it comes to Derek Parks," 
MacPhail says. "I can't tell you how many trades we've turned down involving 
him or some of our other high-profile minor-leaguers. It would be very 
difficult for another team to wrest Derek Parks from us." 
</P>
<P>
That's fine with Stelmaszek, who is looking forward to a chance to work with 
Parks at the major-league level. 
</P>
<P>
"Considering how little he's caught, he's been impressive," the coach says. 
"There's no question he's got a great future."

ANGEL NOTEBOOK;

ON THIS DAY, MINTON DOES IT ALL -- WRONG

<P>
Even Greg Minton was speechless, which said volumes about his 1989 spring debut 
here Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea where to begin," Minton said after weathering two stormy 
innings that saw the Angel relief pitcher realize all his worst fears within a 
matter of minutes. 
</P>
<P>
On the mound, Minton began by walking the first San Diego Padre he faced and 
yielding a single to the second. 
</P>
<P>
Two outs later, a run scored on his wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Then he walked Garry Templeton. 
</P>
<P>
Then he allowed a run-scoring single to Mark Parrent. 
</P>
<P>
Then he walked Ed Whitson, the Padre pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Then he walked Joey Cora, forcing home a third run. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, he struck out Randy Ready to retire the side and squelch the chaos . . 
. only to rev it up again the next inning by botching Tony Gwynn's leadoff 
infield dribbler, which eventually led to another run. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's see," Minton said. "I made one error, I crossed up the catcher three 
times, I gave up five hits and four walks. I don't know where to start. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty sure I impressed Doug, though." 
</P>
<P>
This was new Angel Manager Doug Rader's first glimpse of Minton in an 
exhibition game, but first impressions can be deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
At least, that's what Minton is hoping. "Last spring, I had an elbow problem, 
but that's fine now," Minton said. "Over the winter, I had my knee (surgically 
repaired) and it feels fine. Right now, I feel great -- I just can't get the 
ball within 18 inches of the plate." 
</P>
<P>
Said Rader: "I think with Greggie, he fights himself too much mentally. He 
projects himself as a happy-go-lucky guy. But out there today, he looked like 
he was trying to grind so hard. He ends up digging himself in a hole." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Besides Saturday's 4-2 loss to the Padres, the Angels also suffered an injury 
to first baseman Wally Joyner, who hurt his lower back sliding into second base 
in the fourth inning. Actually, the official medical diagnosis was a "strained 
left buttock." Joyner said he didn't expect to miss any games because of the 
strain, but Manager Doug Rader is planning on holding him out a few days. . . . 
Chuck Finley started for the Angels and pitched three scoreless innings, 
allowing two hits and no walks. Bob McClure and Bryan Harvey worked the last 
three innings. McClure yielded two hits in two innings, Harvey one hit in one 
inning. . . . . The Angels also lost the B game, managing just three singles in 
a 6-0 loss to San Diego.

COMMENTARY;

<P>
AT OKLAHOMA, BUCK STOPS WITH SWITZER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN GREENBERG, The Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like the Roman Empire during its decline and fall, American civilization tends 
to value bread and circuses above all else. There is never enough money to 
build shelters for the homeless, but there is always enough to build another 
$80 million football stadium that will be used 10 times a year. 
</P>
<P>
And when host Miami's Super Bowl is upstaged by cries of police brutality and 
bloody rioting, NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle, on the morning of the league's 
annual Superbash, reminds the media that the party leftovers will be 
distributed to the homeless. As Marie Antoinette said when told the starving 
masses had no bread, "Let 'em eat cake." 
</P>
<P>
A society like ours, so in love with bread and circuses, must have gladiators 
to entertain it. But when the care and feeding of those gladiators gets so out 
of hand that we treat them as if they were above the law -- and instead attack 
those who would bring them to justice -- we are the biggest sickos of all. 
</P>
<P>
The sickos seem to be enjoying a clear majority in Oklahoma, where telephone 
polls conducted by the Tulsa World and KTUL-TV in Tulsa indicate more than 
three-fourths of the callers -- 76 percent in the newspaper's poll, 77 in the 
TV station's -- said Oklahoma Coach Barry Switzer should not resign. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we got three themes from the pro-Switzer people," Alex Adwan, 
editorial page editor of The World, told the New York Times. "First, OU and 
Switzer are not responsible for what every football player does. Second, 
everyone is innocent until proven guilty. 
</P>
<P>
"The third argument was, 'He's not hired to be a babysitter; he's hired to win 
those games.' " 
</P>
<P>
Assuming there were no more arrests of Oklahoma football players while we were 
sleeping, here's a quick update on some of the reasons 24 percent of the 
callers think Switzer should be replaced: 
</P>
<P>
Start with mid-December, when the NCAA placed the Oklahoma football team on 
three years' probation for what it called "major violations." Those included 
offering cars and cash to recruits and giving airline tickets to players. The 
NCAA committee on infractions noted that for "at least several years, the 
university has failed to exercise appropriate institutional control" over its 
football program. 
</P>
<P>
And that, sports fans, is the Mickey Mouse stuff. The NCAA is concerned only 
with recruiting and academic violations. Not with Hill Street Blues-Perry Mason 
style criminality. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, three of every four Oklahomans polled aren't, either. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 10, running back Glen Bell, offensive tackle Nigel Clay and tight end 
Bernard Hall were arraigned for allegedly gang-raping a woman Jan. 21 at Bud 
Wilkinson House, Oklahoma's all-jock dorm. 
</P>
<P>
Eight days earlier, cornerback Jerry Parks shot offensive lineman Zarak Peters 
in the chest after an argument in the dorm. Sports Illustrated reported Parks 
then allegedly aimed the gun at his roommate, starting quarterback Charles 
Thompson, then pointed it at his own head and pulled the trigger, but the gun 
misfired. 
</P>
<P>
As for Thompson, three days after he had lectured grammar-school kids on the 
evils of drug use, the FBI arrested, handcuffed and charged him with selling 17 
grams of cocaine for $1,400 to an undercover agent Jan. 26. If convicted, 
Thompson, the Sooners' leading rusher last fall, could receive 20 years in jail 
and $1 million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
After Thompson's arrest, the university disclosed that he had spent part of 
last summer in a drug rehabilitation center. Nor was this the first time 
Thompson had run afoul of the law. In Tulsa in August 1986, he pleaded guilty 
to a charge of petty larceny and no contest to an assault and battery charge 
for pushing a store clerk and stealing a pair of gloves. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the arrests, The Daily Oklahoman in Oklahoma City and the Tulsa 
World ran editorials saying Switzer should resign. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference following Thompson's arrest, Gov. Henry Bellmon, an 
Oklahoma State graduate, said he was "thoroughly disgusted" with OU football. 
But Bellmon later showed up at another news conference wearing a red OU jacket 
and gave Switzer his blessing. 
</P>
<P>
Was Bellmon having a genuine change of heart? Or was it because, like any good 
politician, he'd seen the results of those pro-Switzer polls? 
</P>
<P>
Switzer's most famous and most outwardly outrageous player, of course, was The 
Boz, linebacker Brian Bosworth, now playing for the Seattle Seahawks of the 
NFL. The Boz was banned from the 1987 Orange Bowl when the NCAA said he had 
tested positive for anabolic steroids. 
</P>
<P>
Bosworth's autobiography, "The Boz," describes Oklahoma as a school where 
berserk behavior by football players -- drug use, gunplay and off-the-field 
violence -- was anything but uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
Defenders of the Sooners said Bosworth's book, which was released before the 
NCAA probation and 1989 arrests, was full of exaggerations and lies. Maybe they 
still feel that way. If you stick your head deep enough in the sand, you could 
probably ignore a nuclear bomb. 
</P>
<P>
Switzer has called each of the charges and arrests "isolated incidents." He has 
said he doesn't deserve blame for his players' misbehavior any more than their 
parents do. 
</P>
<P>
Switzer has always run one of the loosest, and one of the most successful, 
programs in college football. He prides himself on his open-minded outlook 
about today's styles, and he has one of the best reputations for getting along 
with black players. 
</P>
<P>
But is it a coincidence that (as detailed in the Feb. 27 issue of Sports 
Illustrated) Cincinnati Bengals running back Stanley Wilson, who has a history 
of drug problems and was suspended from the Super Bowl for drug abuse, played 
at Oklahoma? That former offensive guard and 1978 Outland Trophy winner Greg 
Roberts, charged in Tampa, Fla., with racketeering and drug-related offenses, 
played at Oklahoma? That former running back David Overstreet, who was killed 
while driving drunk in 1984 and was charged in 1982, along with Roberts, with 
raping an Oklahoma student (she dropped the complaint), played at Oklahoma? 
</P>
<P>
If Switzer isn't at fault, who is? Oklahoma players run amok because he allows 
it. Because they get the signal soon after their arrival on campus that as long 
as they win football games for Oklahoma, they can do just about whatever they 
want. As long as they are good gladiators, the rules don't apply. 
</P>
<P>
If you believe the newspaper and television polls, that's how the people of 
Oklahoma want it, too. To many of them, aside from family and friends, Oklahoma 
football is their primary source of interest. 
</P>
<P>
But while the problem of athletes running amok may be on the grandest scale at 
Oklahoma, it is not confined to Oklahoma. Hardly. It is happening more and more 
all over this land. 
</P>
<P>
It's a frightening statement about how warped our values are, and about the 
type of society we've become.

SWEDISH WOMEN'S HOCKEY TEAM GOES 99-0-1

<P>
Def Leppard is blasting through the dressing room speakers. Pad after pad 
builds tiny players to giants -- and giants they are after a 100-game unbeaten 
streak in the Swedish league. 
</P>
<P>
Annika Persson, 25, shakes her long blond hair before putting on her helmet. 
"Hockey's my sport, I more or less grew up on skates, thanks to dad and my big 
brother," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Persson plays for Nacka Hockey, Sweden's winningest team -- men or women's 
leagues. Last weekend they hit a record 100 league games without a loss, 98 
victories, one tie and a decisive 100th win Saturday by a stunning 24-0. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, we did lose a (league) game back in 1982," Persson says with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
But how do they find motivation after seven years of plain success? If not in 
breaking records, then on the international scene where competition is much 
tougher. 
</P>
<P>
Nacka Hockey is -- with a few exceptions -- the equivalent of the Swedish 
national hockey team, which has the European Championships coming up in April. 
Also, the International Ice Hockey Federation has decided to organize an 
official World Championship next year. 
</P>
<P>
"So far Canada is the only candidate for hosting the championship," Jan-Ake 
Edvinsson, general secretary of the International Ice Hockey Federation, said. 
"We'll make the decision in Stockholm on April 26-27, during the mens' World 
Championships." 
</P>
<P>
Edvinsson said there would be five European teams plus the United States, 
Canada and one Asian team -- probably Japan -- competing. The Europeans would 
qualify according to their results in the European Championships, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nacka's coach, Kurre Svensson, 49, a former Swedish champion who also coaches 
the men's national veteran team, took over the club this year. "I was pretty 
hesitant about girls playing hockey, but these girls are fantastic," the 
convert says. 
</P>
<P>
But the Swedish Ice Hockey Federation is harder to persuade. 
</P>
<P>
"We're warring to be accepted. It's tough with ladies, see, I had grey hair 
before, but now it's even worse," Svensson says shaking his head with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Swedish women participated in an unofficial competition in the 
United States and placed fourth, with Canada capturing the gold.

Armon Gilliam scored 25 points and Tom Chambers 23 as the Phoenix Suns won 
their eighth consecutive home game Saturday night, beating the Clippers, 
133-91, the 19th consecutive road loss for the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix is 27-4 at home this season and 21-0 here against Western Conference 
competition after the victory -- one shy of the franchise's most lopsided win 
ever (142-99 over the New Orleans Jazz on Jan. 11, 1978). 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers, 2-32 on the road this season including an 0-12 mark against 
Pacific Division opponents, have now lost 31 of their last 32 games overall and 
12 straight. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns, who never trailed en route to winning for the 24th time in their last 
26 home games, led 34-24 after the first period and by a 61-46 count as 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam, who had 13 third-quarter points, keyed runs of 6-1 and 12-1 for a 
79-52 lead with 8:17 left. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers got no closer than 21 points in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Norm Nixon and rookie Gary Grant scored 15 points apiece for the Clippers.

Frank Brickowski scored 24 points as the San Antonio Spurs ended their 
club-record 13-game losing streak with a 106-89 victory over the Denver Nuggets 
Saturday night at San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
It was San Antonio's first victory since Feb. 3, when the Spurs defeated the 
Clippers, 106-101. 
</P>
<P>
Alex English scored 16 points for Denver, which was held to fewer than 90 
points for the first time this season. 
</P>
<P>
"As a team tonight we set new standards for ineptitude," Denver Coach Doug Moe 
said. "That is my only comment about tonight's game." 
</P>
<P>
New York 122, Chicago 104 -- Rod Strickland had season highs of 20 points and 
14 assists, and Johnny Newman had 28 points as the Knicks won at New York for 
their 23rd consecutive home victory. 
</P>
<P>
Strickland, a rookie guard, made the first pro start because Mark Jackson went 
on the injury list with torn cartilage in his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordan led the Bulls with 28 points. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 98, Boston 95 -- Rookie Chris Morris scored 20 points, including 
three free throws in the final minute, as the Nets defeated the Celtics at East 
Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Boston, which had its three-game winning streak stopped, trailed through most 
of the fourth quarter before rallying in the closing minutes behind Reggie 
Lewis and Dennis Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics tied the score, 95-95, with 1:54 left when Johnson made two free 
throws. With 59 seconds remaining, Morris put the Nets ahead for good by making 
two free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 119, Dallas 105 -- Jeff Malone scored 28 points at Landover, Md., as 
the Bullets got their third consecutive victory.

</P>
<P>
Seattle 118, Philadelphia 104 -- Xavier McDaniel scored 25 points and Russ 
Schoene had a season-high 20 as the SuperSonics won at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle (35-21) is 14 games over .500 for the first time since the 1982-83 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia completed an eight-game West Coast trip with a 3-5 record. 
</P>
<P>
"These road trips are brutal. Thank God it's over," said Charles Barkley, who 
had 18 points and nine rebounds.

BIRD'S RETURN DATE STILL UNKNOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BARNARD, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jan Volk, general manager of the Boston Celtics, says that March 1 was never 
meant to be a target date for Larry Bird's return to the Boston Celtics' 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"When someone is recovering for four months, there's no way you can put an 
exact date on someone's return," Volk said. "March 1 was just a projection, not 
a prediction. We don't consider it a setback that he's not playing yet. 
</P>
<P>
Bird, who hasn't played since Nov. 15 after surgery on both heels, is going 
through some drills with the team, but Volk still won't guess when he'll 
return. 
</P>
<P>
"I would consider it a setback if he's not back in March, but that's just my 
expectation," Volk said. "But we have to go conservatively because we have to 
consider the long haul." 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a lot of letters, a lot of gifts, a lot of flowers," Bird said of his 
absence. "It hasn't been a lot of fun. But I do like looking at the flowers." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Chambers, never a popular figure in Seattle, is winning friends in Phoenix 
with his praise of teammates and Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons. 
</P>
<P>
"Cotton is always optimistic, always motivated," Chambers said. "He's always 
honest and upfront with me and everyone on the team." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't take Joe Kleine long to learn about Celtics tradition when he was 
traded to Boston by the Sacramento Kings. 
</P>
<P>
"Jan Volk called me and we started to pick out a number, only they don't have 
any numbers. They're all retired," Kleine said. "It took 15 minutes to pick out 
a number. I realized these guys are doing something right." 
</P>
<P>
Kleine, who ended up getting No. 53, found out about the trade while coaching 
his wife through labor. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Knicks teams of the late 1960s and early 1970s enjoy 
near-legendary status in the Big Apple, but that didn't stop Nets coach Willis 
Reed, the center on the Knicks' championship teams, from asking center Patrick 
Ewing to keep a lower profile. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Patrick not to let the Knicks get so good that they'll forget about 
us," Reed said. "He said not to worry about it, he won't let it happen." 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, the Knicks' 21st consecutive victory at Madison Square Garden 
eclipsed the team record of 20 set in 1968-69 and matched in 1972-73. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks, meanwhile, have become the first team in NBA history with three 
players hitting more than 50 3-pointers in a season. They also have the records 
for 3-pointers made and attempted, and they still have 24 games remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Trent Tucker, Johnny Newman and Mark Jackson all have passed the 60 mark for 
3-pointers. Four NBA teams -- Detroit, the Los Angeles Clippers, San Antonio 
and Washington -- have fewer than that. 
</P>
<P>
The Fates haven't been kind to the two previous winners of NBA Coach of the 
Year honors. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 winner, Mike Schuler, was fired as coach of the Portland Trail Blazers 
on Feb. 18 and Doug Moe, winner in 1987, is battling to get the Denver Nuggets 
into the playoffs after a siege of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordan has played less than five NBA seasons, but he already is closing 
in on the Chicago Bulls' career scoring record. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, who recently became the second-fastest player to reach the 10,000-point 
plateau, trails only Bob Love for the Bulls. Love, who played nine seasons with 
the Bulls, finished with 12,623 on Chicago's all-time list.

CS LONG BEACH EXTENDS STREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Long Beach, the seventh-ranked team in the country, extended its 
winning streak to 18 games with an easy 81-68 road victory over UC Santa 
Barbara Saturday night in the final Big West Conference game of the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Cheryl Dowell scored a season-high 20 points and had 13 rebounds to 
lead the 49ers, who are 25-4 overall and 18-0 in the Big West Conference. It's 
the second straight season they have gone 18-0 in conference play. Santa 
Barbara is 9-18 and 4-14. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA 77, Oregon State 61 -- Junior forward Sandra VanEmbricqs scored a 
game-high 25 points and had 13 rebounds to help the Bruins snap a two-game 
losing streak in the Pacific 10 game at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Molly Tideback contributed 16 points and seven rebounds in just 18 minutes of 
action for UCLA (12-14 overall, 8-8 in Pacific-10 play). Chelle Flamoe led 
Oregon State (13-14, 7-10) with 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
USC 71, Oregon 68 -- Tammy Hammond scored 18 points, including a key free throw 
with 1:39 left, to lead the Trojans to the victory in a Pacific-10 game at USC. 
</P>
<P>
USC (12-14, 8-8) trailed at halftime, 41-39, then outscored the Ducks (18-10, 
10-7), 31-17 to take a 70-58 lead with 5:30 left. But a short jumper by 
Stefanie Kasperski began an 8-0 run that cut the lead to 70-66 with 2:37 left.

Ryan Drew scored a season-high 21 points, including four three-point field 
baskets, to lead California to a 74-62 Pacific 10 victory over USC Saturday in 
the last regular-season game for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
Cal, finishing the season 19-11 overall and 10-8 in the conference, trailed, 
49-48, with 9:50 left in the game. But the Golden Bears went on a 14-5 run to 
take a 62-54 lead with 5:31 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans, 9-21 overall and 2-16 in the Pac-10, cut the deficit to 62-58 with 
4:31 left. The Golden Bears, who finished fifth in the conference, scored the 
next nine points for a 71-58 lead, with 1:09 remaining in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm certainly delighted to finish the season with a win," Cal Coach Lou 
Campanelli said. "USC is a tough team, and I mean that. They've played everyone 
tough this season, and all their conference games have been close. 
</P>
<P>
"This team shows a lot of character. When USC came back late in the first half 
and a couple times in the second, we were patient on offense. That's a good 
sign." 
</P>
<P>
For Trojan Coach George Raveling, it was just the latest in a series of 
frustrating defeats. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been consistently inconsistent this season," Raveling said. "It's been 
the strangest season I have ever been involved in. It seens like our play 
fluctuates every five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"We did do a great job of getting back in the game. Our last timeout before the 
half, I told our guys we could tie it up before the half, and we almost did. 
</P>
<P>
"Drew. . . .well, we know he can shoot. He's hot and cold. Today he was hot. 
Cal didn't do anything we didn't expect them to do. It's just that they played 
a good game." 
</P>
<P>
Cal's Keith Smith broke the school's single-season assist record with nine 
against the Trojans, giving him 179. Kevin Johnson, now with the Phoenix Suns, 
held the previous mark with 175 assists set in 1986.

UC IRVINE RALLIES, BUT STILL LOSES, 78-70 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Midway through the first half Saturday night, it appeared the colossal collapse 
was complete. UC Irvine, a team that had seemed to put it all together just a 
month ago, was 23 points behind, and it seemed as if the Anteaters would end 
their regular season with not so much as a whimper. 
</P>
<P>
At least they went down with a growl and a yelp. 
</P>
<P>
UC Santa Barbara, which had taken a 37-14 first-half lead, made 12 of 14 free 
throws in the final two minutes and hung on for a 78-70 Big West Conference 
victory in front of 5,000 in the Bren Center. It was Irvine's fifth consecutive 
defeat at home. 
</P>
<P>
The loss means Irvine (11-16 overall and 8-10 in the conference) will finish in 
eighth place and meet the winner of today's University of the Pacific-San Jose 
State game in the first round of the Big West Tournament at Long Beach Arena at 
9 p.m. Wednesday night. Santa Barbara (20-7, 11-7) takes third place and meets 
Long Beach Thursday at 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the sellout crowd were Santa Barbara fans . . . and many more probably 
wished they were in the first half. But Irvine battled back and closed the gap 
to one -- at 64-63 and 66-65 -- with three minutes left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Had Irvine not made the run, it might as well have mailed in the rest of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
It was senior night's for Irvine, and center Mike Doktorczyk and guard Kevin 
Floyd appeared to be under the impression that it was a license to free-lance 
in the early going. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd scored Irvine's first six points and finished with 17, but he also shot 
two airballs, dribbled the ball off his shoes a couple of times and tried to 
take the ball to the hoop on a one-on-three solo flight. 
</P>
<P>
Doktorczyk made just one of six first-half shots and finished four of 13 -- 
including zero for five on three-pointers -- but he made all 16 free throws he 
attempted and scored 24 points.

LOUISVILLE GETS WELL WITH WIN OVER IRISH

<P>
Louisville, which lost five of its previous eight games, revived its faltering 
fortunes against Notre Dame by beating the Irish, 87-77, Saturday at South 
Bend, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
"When we play like we played today, even though we didn't play that well, it's 
hard to beat us," said guard LaBradford Smith, who scored 19 points for the No. 
14-ranked Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville, 20-8, has gotten some of its enthusiasm back after a three-day 
break following a 77-71 loss at home to Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not been playing well, so it was good to get a victory," Coach Denny 
Crum said. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals' Kenny Payne led all scorers with 27 points, and Pervis Ellison 
added 18. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame (18-7) trailed from midway through the first half, but twice closed 
to within four points, the last time on a three-pointer by Joe Fredrick that 
made it 71-67. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville came back with six straight points, including four by Payne, to take 
a 10-point lead with two minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame played most of the game without its second-leading scorer, freshman 
forward LaPhonso Ellis. He left without scoring three minutes into the game 
after suffering a compound dislocation of his right index finger. Keith 
Robinson led the Irish with 18 points and 16 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville, which starts the Metro Conference Tournament on Friday, still may 
not be ready mentally, Crum said. 
</P>
<P>
"This team has struggled to get over the hump," he said. "We have got to get 
some rest and play well down the stretch." 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma 103, Nebraska 76 -- Mookie Blaylock scored 19 of his 22 points in the 
second half when the No. 4 Sooners pulled away from the Cornhuskers to win the 
Big Eight game at Norman, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
The Sooners ended the regular season at 26-4 -- their eighth straight 
20-victory season -- and won the conference title with a 12-2 record. Oklahoma 
plays last-place Colorado in the first round of the Big Eight tournament 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Blaylock made only one of nine shots in the first half when he shot primarily 
from outside. By taking the ball inside in the second half, he had more success 
as the Sooners won their 30th straight at home. 
</P>
<P>
Nebraska (16-14, 4-10) got no closer than 17 points after Oklahoma took a 
20-point lead with 7:12 left. The Sooners used a 12-0 run in the closing 
minutes to open their biggest lead, 97-68, with 2:54 left. 
</P>

Missouri 66, Colorado 65 -- Greg Church made three free throws in the final 11

10-3) held off the Buffaloes to complete the regular season with a 16-0 home 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Morton's three-point basket with 48 seconds left cut the Tigers' lead to 
63-60. After Missouri's Lee Coward missed the front end of a one-and-one,

<P>
Church made two free throws with 11 seconds left and added another with five

</P>
<P>
Rice, the Big Ten's leading scorer with a 24.9 average, helped the Wolverines 
get 71 second-half points. It marked the ninth time this season that Michigan

</P>
<P>
Southern Mississippi (10-16, 2-10) lost its last seven games and will be seeded 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Ball State 92, Western Michigan 79 -- The No. 19 Cardinals extended their 
winning streak to 12 games in the Mid-American Conference game at Kalamazoo, 
Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Ball State (25-2, 14-2) tied the score at 38-38 with 54 seconds remaining in 
the first half on a three-point basket by Billy Butts, and Keith Stalling's 
layup with three seconds left in the half put the Cardinals ahead to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Ball State went on an 11-4 run early in the second half to take a 51-42 lead. 
Billy Stanback's three-pointer for Western Michigan (12-15, 6-10) cut the

</P>
<P>
Clemson 81, Georgia Tech 79 -- Dale Davis and Eldon Campbell scored the final 
24 points to lead the Tigers to the overtime victory in the ACC game at 
Clemson, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, who had 22 points and 10 rebounds, tied the score, 69-69, on two free 
throws with 25 seconds remaining in regulation. Anthony Sherrod missed a 
three-pointer with two seconds left in regulation for Georgia Tech (20-10, 
8-6). 
</P>
<P>
Clemson (18-9, 7-7) scored the first six points of overtime, including two 
dunks by Davis, who had 29 points, and led, 81-74, with 1:07 left. But Tom 
Hammonds scored on a short jumper and Dennis Scott hit a three-pointer to make 
it 81-79 with 32 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Alabama 83, Florida 63 -- Michael Ansley scored 25 points and the Crimson Tide 
held Dwayne Schintzius below his average while defeating the Southeastern 
Conference champion Gators at Tuscaloosa, Ala., to end the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
The victory moved Alabama (20-7, 12-6), a preseason pick to finish well back in 
the SEC, into a second-place tie with Vanderbilt. Florida (19-11, 13-5) won the 
title outright when Tennessee defeated Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
Schintzius, averaging 19 points, got his fourth foul with 17:23 left and spent 
several minutes on the bench, winding up with 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee 78, Vanderbilt 61 -- The Commodores were held to their lowest point 
total of the season in the regular-season ending SEC game at Knoxville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
The Volunteers used two bursts in the first half to build a lead the Commodores 
could not overcome. A 17-3 run gave them a 21-12 lead with 10:39 left. Dyron 
Nix had three three-point baskets and another basket in that spurt for half of 
his 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
Vanderbilt (18-12, 12-6) moved to within 21-19 on a basket by Barry Goheen, who 
was held to eight points. The Volunteers (18-9, 11-7) closed the half with a 
21-7 run to make it 42-26 and the Commodores never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi 113, Louisiana State 112 -- Gerald Glass scored his 53rd point with 
nine seconds left in overtime to give the Rebels the Southeastern Conference 
victory at Oxford, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
LSU freshman Chris Jackson, who scored 55 points, made a three-pointer and a 
free throw with 17 seconds to send the game into overtime at 106-106. 
</P>
<P>
Glass made a three-point shot with 1:05 left in overtime to tie the game, 
112-112. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers (20-10, 11-7) then missed a three-pointer, and Glass was fouled with 
nine seconds to play to set up the winning free throw for the Rebels (14-13, 
8-10). 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's 55 points gives him 895 for the season, an NCAA freshman record. He 
broke the record of 854 by James (Fly) Williams of Austin Peay in 29 games in 
1973. The 55 also is a single-game freshman record, breaking his own mark of 53 
against Florida on Dec. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State 89, Brigham Young 72 -- Pat Durham scored 31 points to lead the 
Rams past the Cougars at Provo, Utah, clinching at least a share of the Western 
Athletic Conference title. 
</P>
<P>
BYU (14-14, 7-9) led, 40-38, at the half, but Colorado State (20-8, 12-4) took 
control with a 10-2 run to open the second half. The Rams shot 78% in the 
second half and 67% for the game.

Rodney Monroe scored 26 points, including shots that put North Carolina State 
into two of the four overtime periods, as the 20th-ranked Wolfpack outlasted 
Wake Forest, 110-103, Saturday in the longest Atlantic Coast Conference game in 
history. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina State, 20-7 overall, 10-4 in the ACC, is assured of at least a 
tie for the regular-season championship. Wake Forest is 13-14 and 3-11. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe grabbed the rebound of a deliberately missed free throw by Kelsey Weems 
with two seconds left in regulation and made a basket to make it 77-77. 
Wolfpack guard Chris Corchiani drove the lane in the final seconds of the first 
overtime to tie score, 84-84. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Boyd and Derrick McQueen each hit three-point shots for Wake Forest in the 
next overtime, but Monroe scored with 45 seconds left in the period to make it 
92-92. 
</P>
<P>
The third overtime ended after N.C. State's Brian Howard tipped in a missed 
shot at the 1:02 mark to make it 96-96. The Wolfpack overpowered a tiring Wake 
Forest team in the final period as Monroe made the first basket and the final 
two free throws. The game lasted 2 hours 39 minutes.

HAVING ALREADY COME A LONG WAY, WOMEN DECIDE TO CHANGE SPONSOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Thomas Bonk 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Women's professional tennis will enter the next decade with a new sponsor . . . 
sort of. There will be a change from Virginia Slims to General Foods -- or from 
cigarettes to cereal. Although both are Philip Morris companies, 1990 will be 
the first year since 1970 that Virginia Slims has not sponsored the women's 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, General Foods' five-year, $28-million contract with the Women's 
International Professional Tennis Council (WIPTC) to serve as the worldwide 
sponsor of the women's game may have elevated politics to a new level in the 
most political of pro sports. 
</P>
<P>
General Foods won the right to sponsor women's tennis over Procter &amp; 
Gamble, which withdrew its four-year, $31-million bid from consideration when 
it sensed a lack of support from the players. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as Merrett Stierheim became the chief executive officer of the Women's 
International Tennis Assn. (WITA) in 1985, he began pressing for a change in 
sponsors, partly because of the image drawn between cigarettes and women 
athletes. For years, there had been a growing uneasiness that women's tennis 
was sponsored by a product that is believed to be a cause of lung cancer. 
However, there was also a feeling of loyalty to Philip Morris and this was 
especially keen in the veteran players. 
</P>
<P>
"When we first started out, Virginia Slims was the only people that would help 
us out," said Martina Navratilova of the WITA executive board. "They really put 
women's tennis on the map. But now, it's time to diversify." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the agreement, General Foods, will become the overall series 
sponsor, and Virginia Slims will keep its season-ending Virginia Slims 
Championships, the bonus pool and title sponsorship of an undetermined number 
of events. 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Merlo, vice president of marketing services at Philip Morris, said that 
Virginia Slims will announce, just before Wimbledon, details and format of its 
named events in 1990. Merlo said she is confident that the female players 
welcomed the continued involvement of Philip Morris. 
</P>
<P>
As president of the WITA, Chris Evert said she was part of discussions with 
Philip Morris as long as two years ago when the corporation was told that the 
women's players did not want a cigarette company as an umbrella sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
"The general feeling is to try to gradually get away from the cigarette 
sponsorship, to put it bluntly," she said. "There has been a lot of negative 
press about athletes being associated (with cigarettes). But quite honestly, 
they're the only ones that really have been able to put up a lot of money for 
these sports. It's like, 'Hey, where are the other sponsors knocking on the 
door?' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
WITA Vice President Pam Shriver said the public may notice the change in 
sponsorship and it will "take a little bit of the controversial sting off the 
cigarette focus." 
</P>
<P>
She said there are many who believe that women's tennis should not have any 
involvement with a tobacco product, but she does not agree. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not a smoking advocate in any way, but I am an advocate of people's 
Constitutional rights to advertise and to promote a product that's a legal 
product," she said. "It's not like there's a lack of information about it. 
People make decisions on whether or not they're going to do things that aren't 
necessarily good for the body. 
</P>
<P>
"You could do a bunch of things," Shriver said. "You could over-eat yourself to 
death. That's the way I'm going to go." 
</P>
<P>
Spurned suitor Procter &amp; Gamble got in the last word anyway. The company 
recently withdrew its $500,000 sponsorship of the WITA, saying the program 
didn't mean much without the overall sponsorship of the women's tour. 
</P>
<P>
Evert is top seeded for the $250,000 Virginia Slims of Indian Wells begining 
Monday at Hyatt Grand Champions. She has a first-round bye, then plays the 
winner of Hana Mandlikova's match against a qualifier. 
</P>
<P>
Evert will be playing her first tournament as the No. 4 ranked player in the 
world, which she became last week when Gabriela Sabatini moved up to No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Also receiving first-round byes are second-seeded Helena Sukova, third-seeded 
Shriver and fourth-seeded Manuela Maleeva. Lori McNeil, seeded fifth, plays 
Terry Phelps in a first-round match. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy Austin, playing her first tournament singles in five years, meets 
seventh-seeded Nicole Provis in the first round. Austin and Kathy Rinaldi are 
wild-card entries. Maleeva got into the 28-player draw as a special exemption 
when Amy Frazier, who earned a straight entry into the draw after winning the 
Virginia Slims of Kansas, decided not to use it. 
</P>
<P>
Claudia Kohde-Kilsch withdrew from singles because of an injury. Patty Fendick 
also withdrew from singles but will play doubles. 
</P>
<P>
It was bound to happen: The International Tennis Federation, reigning monolith 
of world tennis, is at odds with the Assn. of Tennis Professionals, who want to 
govern themselves in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The ITF, which had sole responsibility for setting the men's tour calendar 
until the ATP announced its own 1990 tour schedule, is challenging the ATP 
about when the Davis Cup should be played in 1990. This move by the IFF is 
regarded as the first serious test of the ATP's plan to run its own tour. 
</P>
<P>
In January, the ATP said its 1990 calendar showed that the first round of 
world-group Davis Cup matches would be scheduled the week starting Jan. 29, the 
week immediately after the Australian Open. However, the ITF has said that 1990 
Davis Cup competition will begin the week of Feb. 5 so players have time to 
adjust to travel. 
</P>
<P>
If the Davis Cup is actually played the week of Feb. 5 as the ITF wants it to 
be, then it would be in direct conflict with three ATP tournaments: a $600,000 
event at Milan, a $250,000 event at San Francisco and a $150,000 event at 
Guaruja, Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton Jordan, chief executive officer of the ATP, said the ATP tour board 
would not find the ITF's decision acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
However, the ITF remains the governing body responsible for overseeing the 
Davis Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Consider Swedish player Jonas Svensson. Would you buy a used car from this man? 
How about a new one? 
</P>
<P>
In a unique promotional agreement with Svensson, Volvo Motors of Sweden has 
signed Svensson to sell cars at each city where he plays a Grand Prix event. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, Stefan Edberg has signed ProServ to represent him. Edberg, the 
23-year-old reigning Wimbledon champion, recently sued Advantage International, 
which was his management company for six years. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Advantage countersued Edberg for breach of contract and is seeking 
$7.5 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
According to Advantage, the dispute started when the Inland Revenue, the United 
Kingdom's version of the Internal Revenue Service, audited Edberg, who 
maintains a residence in London. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg sued Advantage alleging breach of contract, demanding that Advantage pay 
his English taxes. He also asked that his contract with the Washington-based 
company, which has three years to run, be terminated. 
</P>
<P>
According to Advantage, after Edberg filed suit, the tax issue was settled in 
his favor. Advantage decided to sue. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Pasarell, tournament director of the Newsweek Champions Cup , said he 
would like to have John McEnroe as one of his five wild cards, but McEnroe has 
played three straight weeks and has said he needs time off to prepare for the 
Davis Cup, April 7-9, at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Pasarell's biggest star, Boris Becker, withdrew from the WCT Finals in Dallas 
because of the flu and Andre Agassi, his second-biggest star, withdrew from the 
same event after he pulled a muscle. Both are expected to play in the Newsweek 
event. 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
There's a new book out by Donald Dell, founder and chairman of ProServ and one 
of the most powerful men in tennis: "Minding Other People's Business," 
published by Villard Books. . . . Ivan Lendl, top-ranked player in the world, 
will play Jimmy Connors in the continuing Michelin Challenge exhibition series 
at 7:30 p.m. April 12 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
ProServ, which represents Connors, said he withdrew from the WCT Finals because 
of injury. Connors is entered at Scottsdale this week and also in the Newsweek 
Champions Cup. . . . Since Pam Shriver is not playing the French Open, her 
usual Grand Slam doubles partner, Martina Navratilova, will be teaming with 
Hana Mandlikova. Navratilova is also going to have a different doubles partner 
at Rome: Chris Evert.

TENNIS ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
MCENROE TOO MUCH FOR GILBERT THIS TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John McEnroe had a score to settle with Brad Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe, off to his best start since 1985, scored a 6-3, 6-3, 7-6 victory over 
Gilbert Saturday to win his record fifth WCT finals championship at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great to be back," McEnroe said. "It's as good as I've played since the 
birth of my children. I'll take it easy a few weeks and get ready for the Davis 
Cup against France (in early April)." 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert has beaten McEnroe just once in 12 meetings, but that defeat at the 
1985 Masters sent McEnroe into a six-month sabbatical saying, "I'm not going to 
play tennis if I lose to jerks like that." 
</P>
<P>
The sixth-ranked McEnroe ran his all-time WCT Finals bankroll to $925,000 with 
the $200,000 he won against 16th-ranked Gilbert, who settled for $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert was competitive only in the third set, which went to a tiebreaker. 
McEnroe won, 7-3, when Gilbert double-faulted on match point. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe, who has a 21-4 record career record in the WCT finals, is 15-2 this 
year, his best start since he won his first 10 matches of 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Steffi Graf overcame frigid winds and Hana Mandlikova, 7-6, 6-3, in the 
semifinals of the U.S. Women's Hardcourt Championships at San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never played in such terrible weather," Graf said. "You have to have 
luck. You have no rhythm at all. I'm happy it's over." 
</P>
<P>
Graf was on the verge of losing her first set of the year when she trailed, 
5-4, in the opening set. However, she fought off two set points with the help 
of a miss-hit by Mandlikova, and rallied to even the set, 5-5, and eventually 
won the tiebreaker, 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
"I missed an easy forehand volley," Mandlikova said. "The whole match would 
have been totally different, obviously. With her big swings, it's harder for 
her to play in this weather. But she came up with good points when she needed 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Ann Henricksson defeated Katrina Adams, 6-3, 4-6, 6-3, in the other semifinal.

WORLD TRAVEL WATCH: AIDS TESTING IS REQUIRED IN MORE COUNTRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY HABEGGER and JAMES O'REILLY, Habegger and O'Reilly are free-lance 
writers living in Northern California. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
World Travel Watch is a monthly report designed to help you make informed 
judgments about travel throughout the world. Because conditions can change 
overnight, always make your own inquiries before you leave home. In the United 
States, contact the nearest passport agency office; abroad, check in with the 
nearest American Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
 Asia 
</P>
<P>
 -- Japan: A law permitting immigration authorities to prohibit foreigners 
carrying the AIDS virus from entering the country went into effect Feb. 17. 
</P>
<P>
The law allows officials to require AIDS tests for any traveler who fits an 
AIDS profile, loosely defined as those demonstrating homosexual or drug-related 
behavior. How authorities will determine who fits this profile remains vague. 
</P>
<P>
Instructions from Japan's Foreign Office state that this will be determined 
"from all information available at that time." Travelers suspected of carrying 
the virus will be tested, and if found to be infected, a decision will be made 
regarding entry. 
</P>
<P>
According to a Japanese consular official reading from the Foreign Office 
instructions, the testing physician will assess whether the person is likely to 
spread the disease in Japan, taking into account the person's "social behavior 
patterns in the past, giving due consideration to his business career, age, 
purpose of entry and strength of infectivity." 
</P>
<P>
There is no clear signal yet about how actively this new law is being enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nepal: Foreigners living here may now stay for a maximum of three months 
and then must spend one month outside the country before reentering with a new 
visa. 
</P>
<P>
In exceptional circumstances a four-month stay can be arranged, but the visa 
holder will not be allowed to return for either six months or a year, depending 
on the stamp issued by immigration officials on departure. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers using Katmandu as a base for trips to Tibet or India must be sure to 
request a multiple entry visa. 
</P>
<P>
 -- North Korea: Closed to U.S. citizens for the last 40 years, North Korea has 
opened its borders to Americans and is actively seeking tours. 
</P>
<P>
This development reflects an easing of tensions between North and South Korea 
and the North's awareness of the value of opening up its economy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tibet: All travel agencies in Tibet were recently placed under the control 
of a central Chinese government agency, which could mean that foreign tour 
operators will no longer be able to choose their local outfitters. 
</P>
<P>
Africa 
</P>
<P>
 -- Chad: Chad and Libya exchanged diplomats last October and agreed to settle 
their differences peacefully, but Chad's disputed northern region is still 
militarized and portions of it are heavily mined. 
</P>
<P>
Fighting between insurgents and government forces occurred recently in eastern 
border areas with Sudan. Travel to both of these areas is restricted. Check 
with the U.S. Embassy in N'Djamena for current conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Somalia: Avoid areas along the Ethiopian border and the northern regions of 
Bari, Sanag and Togdheer because of unsettled security conditions. Register 
with the U.S. Embassy in Mogadishu on arrival. 
</P>
<P>
Persian Gulf 
</P>
<P>
 -- Oman: The Sultan of Oman has decreed that visitors shall not disturb sea 
turtles nesting on the beaches because Oman's coastline is the endangered 
species' most important Indian Ocean breeding ground. 
</P>
<P>
Mediterranean 
</P>
<P>
 -- Greece: Security has been tightened in Piraeus, Athens' port city, in an 
effort to prevent a repeat of last year's terrorist incident aboard a luxury 
cruise ship. Check-in time may be increased an hour by new procedures, so 
report to the pier as much as six hours before departure. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern Europe 
</P>
<P>
 -- Czechoslovakia: Visas are now available at four border checkpoints, three 
on the Austrian border and one on West Germany's. 
</P>
<P>
Visas cost about $30 and are good for 30 days, and can be obtained at Dolni 
Dvoriste, Hate, Petrzalka and Rozvadov. 
</P>
<P>
South America 
</P>
<P>
 -- Argentina: Buenos Aires is experiencing a power shortage that has been 
going on for months, producing nightly brownouts and shutdowns throughout the 
city. Few hotels have auxiliary generators and most have their power shut off 
for as much as six hours a day. Take a flashlight and extra batteries.

 -- Trinidad: The risk of yellow fever exists outside urban areas. A 
vaccination is not required for entry or onward travel at this time, but is 
advised. Yellow fever inoculations last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asia 
</P>
<P>
 -- Burma: Another Burmese domestic aircraft crashed recently, the fourth since 
mid-1987, this time evidently the result of engine failure. Travel by land when 
possible, especially during the rainy season from May through September, when 
flying is riskier. 
</P>
<P>
Political conditions have stabilized and the country is again open for tourism, 
but individual travel is not permitted. All travelers to Burma must make 
arrangements through Tourist Burma, the state tourist agency. 
</P>
<P>
Health Note 
</P>
<P>
 -- AIDS testing: Thirty-nine countries in addition to the United States have 
some kind of AIDS testing requirements for arriving foreigners, including 
students, those requesting work permits and tourists planning to stay longer 
than a specified time, usually not less than a month and often as long as three 
to six months. (In the case of Iraq, all foreigners must report to a doctor for 
an AIDS test within five days of arrival, and certification of an AIDS test in 
the United States is not valid.) If you plan a lengthy stay in a country, check 
with its consular or embassy officials for testing requirements before you go.

THE TIMES SHOPPER: EUROPE AND HONG KONG STILL OFFERING BUCK-SAVING BARGAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Shopping abroad this summer? Unfortunately, the dollar doesn't buy as much as 
it used to in the world's shopping capitals, but there are still buck-saving 
bargains to be had in London, Paris, Milan and Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the dollar's diminished value, goods usually cost less where they're 
made. In Europe, best buys include perfumes, woolens, leather goods, clothing, 
crystal and china. In the Orient, look for ready-to-wear and made-to-order 
clothing, jewelry, curios, gadgets and gift items. 
</P>
<P>
Check stores and learn prices at home so you'll know how much you're saving 
overseas. Price perfumes, liquor, silk scarfs, ties, jewelry, pens and other 
items in airport duty-free and airline in-flight shops. 
</P>
<P>
If these prices are lower than overseas, you can buy on your way home. 
Duty-frees and in-flights, however, have limited supplies and stock varies. 
</P>
<P>
In Europe, tax rebates (averaging 12% to 18%, depending upon type of 
merchandise) offer substantial savings for foreign shoppers who are buying for 
export. Rebate policies differ from country to country, shop to shop. 
</P>
<P>
All require minimum purchases, but some allow rebates only on big-ticket items. 
Others allow accumulation of smaller purchases to meet the minimum. 
</P>
<P>
Some charge processing fees, some give rebates on the spot, others have forms 
to be stamped by customs when you leave the country and then mailed back to the 
store for a rebate check. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Season for Sales 
</P>
<P>
In Europe, July sales offer bargains. Follow residents to discount shops and 
shopping streets. Discount shops change stock frequently and have limited 
quantities, so if you see something you like, buy it immediately. 
</P>
<P>
London's bargains in beautiful cashmeres, Shetlands and woolen sweaters in an 
astonishing array of colors and styles are available at Westaway &amp; Westaway 
(65 and 92-93 Great Russell St.). Despite a recent price-raising run on 
cashmere, you can get fine double-ply sweaters there for about $95. 
</P>
<P>
Of all English labels, Laura Ashley (256-258 Regent St. and other locations) 
has a noticeable difference in London versus U.S. prices, with regular tags on 
clothes and home furnishings about 15% to 20% less. Many sales bins offer 
everything from stockings to rolls of wallpaper ($5 and up) at ridiculously low 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
Other chic English and continental labels are discounted up to 40% at the 
Constant Sale Shop (54 Fulham Road) where Krizia, Katherine Hamnett, Valentino, 
Comme des Garcons, Armani and other designers sell end-of-season merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
The Reject China Shop (134 Regent St.) sells Aynsley, Royal Worcester, 
Portmeirion and other English china as well as French, German and Japanese 
tableware, at about 20% to 40% less than U.S. prices, and offer tax rebates on 
purchases of $65 or more. 
</P>
<P>
Filofax agendas, with forms to facilitate record-keeping of every sort, are 
sold for about $100 (about one-third the U.S. price) at Paperchase (167 Fulham 
Road) and other London stationery stores, and at Harrods (Knightsbridge). 
</P>
<P>
Harrods' July sales aren't as spectacular as its January sales, but prices are 
still good. At other times, merchandise is full price. Harrods' advantages 
include inexpensive signature items (gift-wrapped teas and biscuits, pens, 
scarfs and teddy bears), time-saving one-stop shopping and tax rebates on 
cumulative value of small purchases acquired during one or several days. 
</P>
<P>
Marks &amp; Spencer, the lower-middle-priced department store chain with 
branches throughout London, has good and inexpensive underwear and socks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shopping in Paris 
</P>
<P>
Paris' magnificent department stores, Galleries Lafayette (40 Boulevard 
Haussmann) and Au Printemps (64 Boulevard Haussmann) offer one-stop shopping 
for French designer goods, perfumes, china, crystal and more. 
</P>
<P>
Both provide aides to guide foreigners through departments and facilitate 
on-the-spot tax rebates for customers who have bought the minimum required 
amount, either with one expensive item or several lesser purchases. 
</P>
<P>
If department stores prove too pricey, Paris has discount shops. About a dozen 
excellent crystal and china discounters, offering Havilland, Bernardaud and 
Villery &amp; Boch porcelain patterns, plus Baccarat, Saint-Louis and Daum 
crystal glasses and decorative pieces, are on Rue de Paradis. The shops sell 
individual pieces and/or sets, and will ship. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Look for 'Stock' Label 
</P>
<P>
French designer clothes are discounted in shops designated "stock." Styles may 
be from seasons past, but are usually top quality. 
</P>
<P>
Rue d'Alesia's string of well-stocked stores includes Dorothee Bis (No. 74), 
MicMac (No. 80), Daniel Hechter (No. 92), Cacharel (No. 114), Lasserre (No. 
122) and others, with women's, men's and children's styles. 
</P>
<P>
Designer Jean-Louis Scherrer's discount shop is at 29 Avenue Ledru-Rollin and 
Nina Ricci's sales items are in the basement of her haute couture salon (39 
Avenue Montaigne). C. Mendes (65 Rue Montmartre) has discounted Saint-Laurent 
fashions. Many boutiques at nearby Forum des Halles, Paris' large shopping 
center, have markdowns on end-of-line styles by first- and second-string 
designers. 
</P>
<P>
Bally (1 Rue du Louvre) sells its own label of women's, men's and children's 
footwear at discounted prices. Women's shoes are about $90 and up. 
</P>
<P>
For perfumes, try Catherine (6 Rue de Castiglione), a duty-free shop offering 
108 scents for men and women from 49 perfume makers (Dior, Carven, Rochas, YSL, 
Chanel and others), as well as assorted cosmetics, scarf and ties for up to 40% 
off list prices. Other duty-frees have similar discounts, but more limited 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The City of Discounts 
</P>
<P>
In Italy, Milan is the city for discount shoppers. Mila Schon Negozio (Piazza 
Umanitaria 2) has classic Schon from seasons past marked down 50% or more. 
Linen and cotton sweaters sell for $40, silk blouses for about $120, silk 
scarfs are $5 and up. 
</P>
<P>
At Laura Bagiotti (Via Borgospesso 19), ask to see sale items in the back room 
for some terrific buys of moda alta styles. Il Salvagente (Via Fratelli 
Bronzetti 16) has Krizia, Ferre, Versace, Trussardi and other designer clothes 
at discounted prices, crammed in among other labels. 
</P>
<P>
Beware, however, because not all the clothes are new and some are slightly 
damaged. Vesti Stock Uno (Viali Romagna 19) and Due (Via Ramazzini) are sister 
discount shops near each other, offering men's, women's and children's styles 
by designers including Versace, Kansai, Montana, Moschino and others. 
</P>
<P>
Gucci Liquidazioni (Via Corridoni 13), the Gucci outlet, has a selection of 
double G leather goods at discounted prices, including handbags (from $100), 
silk scarfs (from $50) and neckties (from $25), wallets, key cases and other 
small leather goods, and some clothing including leather skirts and cashmere 
sweaters (from $215). Gucci offers an 18% tax rebate on purchases exceeding 
800,000 lire (about $630 U.S.). 
</P>
<P>
Parabiago, Milan's industrial suburb, has the Fratelli Rossetti Factory (Via 
Cantu 24) for stunning shoes (men's styles from $45 and women's from $60), and 
Stefano Serapian (Via Jomelli 35-37) for leather handbags (from $30) and 
rubberized carry bags (from $40). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bargains in the Orient 
</P>
<P>
In the Orient, famous designer merchandise manufactured in Hong Kong is sold at 
bargain prices in shops in that city. Discounters along Granville Road and in 
Stanley Market have French and Italian designer label silk dresses and 
ensembles for $60 and up, suede slacks ($45 and up), leather jackets ($85 and 
up) and a wide range of sports and casual ensembles ($20 and up). 
</P>
<P>
Factory outlets in the Kaiser Estates (Man Yue Street, Hunghom, Kowloon) 
include Four Seasons with pretty paisley silk dresses ($100 and up) and 
Camberley Enterprises with Anne Klein II silk blouses for $50 and wool sweater 
dresses for $60. 
</P>
<P>
Sam's (Burlington Arcade, Nathan Road, Kowloon) is a reliable source for 
clothes made-to-measure from a wide selection of fabrics. Have old clothes 
copied or choose styles from fashion magazines (from about $280 a suit). With 
three fittings, suits are completed in four days. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Tsui Jewelry (Golden Mile Holiday Inn, Nathan Road, Kowloon) has fabulous 
jade, pearls, lapis, as well as diamonds, colored gems and semi-precious stones 
sold loose or set beautifully into 14k or 18k gold rings, pendants, necklaces. 
Prices and service are excellent. 
</P>
<P>
China Products Co. (488-500 Hennessy Road, Hong Kong) stocks trinkets and 
knickknacks including cloisonne bracelets (from $10) and other pieces of 
jewelry and vases (from $15), embroidered silk blouses (from $40), pillow 
covers and linen tablecloths (from $25), dolls and toys. 
</P>
<P>
Chung Wing and Wing Shing Curios (167-169 Hollywood Road, Hong Kong) has 
antique and reproduction Oriental knickknacks, including jewelry boxes ($20 and 
up), cloisonne and porcelain vases ($17 and up), jade statuettes and bowls.

ALL ABOARD THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN TRAIN IN CANADA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN SKLAREWITZ, Sklarewitz is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
VANCOUVER, Canada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was early afternoon when engineer Don Angus steadily eased the throttle on 
the 3,000-horsepower diesel electric locomotive along the main line at 
mile-marker 114 out of Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers aboard the train crowded the open vestibules, cameras poised, while 
those inside lined up before the large picture windows. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty yards away appeared Pyramid Falls, cascading majestically down Canada's 
Mt. Cheadle. We heard the roar of water and caught the scent of pine. 
</P>
<P>
This was just one of the attractions along the Monashee Mountains area of the 
Canadian Rockies between the towns of Kamloops in British Columbia and Jasper 
in Alberta Province. 
</P>
<P>
Few railroads accommodate passengers as does the Rocky Mountain Daylight Train. 
Organized last year, the run will be repeated again from spring until early 
autumn by Via Rail Canada, the Canadian counterpart to America's Amtrak 
railroad system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Maximum Sightseeing 
</P>
<P>
On June 4, and continuing every Sunday morning through Oct. 15, the train will 
leave the Canadian Northern Railroad Station in Vancouver, British Columba, at 
9 a.m. and head east. 
</P>
<P>
For two days it will move along a route on a schedule designed to provide the 
maximum sightseeing opportunities through some of the most spectacular mountain 
scenery on the North American continent. And passengers won't miss attractions 
at night, as the train stops every evening. 
</P>
<P>
Until last year, passengers got only bits of the Canadian Rockies as they 
traveled aboard another trans-Canadian train that operates between Vancouver 
and Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Because of complaints from passengers over missing much of the scenery, the new 
train was placed in service. 
</P>
<P>
From Vancouver, after an all-day run, it arrives at the little town of Kamloops 
where passengers overnight. The next morning the train is split into two 
sections. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Retracing Their Runs 
</P>
<P>
One group of four cars heads for the resort town of Jasper in the heart of 
Jasper National Park, the other six continue to Banff National Park. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday morning both trains retrace their runs back to Kamloops for another 
overnight and a return to Vancouver. Travelers have the option of going one way 
or round trip. Overnight accommodations at Kamloops are included in the price 
(this year about $230 one way or $400 round trip). 
</P>
<P>
One-way passengers to Jasper have a variety of transportation choices for any 
additional excursions: They may rent a car, take a motor coach or go by train 
from Jasper to Banff, and then travel to Calgary. Banff/Calgary vacationers can 
continue to Jasper. 
</P>
<P>
Assigned to each car on the train is a service attendant who serves meals, 
complimentary soft drinks, tea and coffee and provides detailed information 
about sights along the route. 
</P>
<P>
On a typical eastbound Rocky Mountain by Daylight run, each car can take 35 to 
55 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Because the train has no dining car, meals and refreshments are served to 
passengers at seats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Changing Panorama 
</P>
<P>
Of more importance is the constantly changing panorama unfolding outside the 
coach windows. As the train moves through the wilderness it passes small 
settlements and sawmills. Fishermen wave from rivers and lakes and rafters 
sweep through rapids. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving Vancouver there are the flatlands of the Fraser Delta as well as 
the 850-mile Fraser River that was the primary transportation route for 
trappers, hunters and gold seekers in western Canada's early days. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of this trip passengers arrive at Moose Lake, headwaters of that 
same mighty river. 
</P>
<P>
To the east loom a stately parade of peaks -- Hope, Ogilvie, Squeah and Spider 
-- and to the west rises Mt. Baird, The Old Settler and Mt. Urguhart. 
</P>
<P>
Later the train moves past Hell's Gate, where the waters of the Fraser churn in 
white fury. 
</P>
<P>
Ahead are more miles of scenery: mountain peaks, glaciers and tumbling 
waterfalls. 
</P>

THE MATURE TRAVELER: SENIORS PUT MAJOR EMPHASIS ON CONVENIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HUGHES, Hughes is a 30-year veteran travel writer living in Sherman 
Oaks. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It seems that international travel for senior citizens is decided not so much 
by destinations and dollars as by comfort and convenience. 
</P>
<P>
Where to go and what it will cost are still major factors, especially for older 
seniors constricted in discretionary travel spending. These seniors look for 
travel value. 
</P>
<P>
Seniors have had their flings with solo travel. They've had it with airport 
hassles, baggage checking, transfers, finding hotels and restaurants and all 
the other details that seem adventurous to the young. 
</P>
<P>
The answer often lies in escorted tours. These tours lack some freedom of 
choice but make up for it in security and the convenience of letting couriers 
and guides do all the work. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, seniors seek leisurely tours, as few as possible one-night stays, 
shorter tour days, or at least no long, seemingly unending motor-coach drives. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part they prefer meal- and entertainment-inclusive tours. And they 
prefer to travel with their peers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Specialists 
</P>
<P>
Many Southern California travel and tour agents specialize in such tours. Most 
are also members of STRAC, the organization dedicated to making travel easier 
and better. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some of these agents and their international travel plans for spring 
and summer. (All prices are per person, based on sharing a double room and 
leaving from Los Angeles.) 
</P>
<P>
Richard Adams Tours: Specialists in 12- to 15-day European tours with six trips 
this year. Best of Britain, May 16-30, $2,395; Best of France, June 11-25, 
$2,495; English and Scottish countryside, July 15-29, $2,795; Scandinavia, Aug. 
6-20, $2,795; London to Paris, Aug. 21-Sept. 1, $2,295; Festive Alpine Tour, 
Sept. 16-30, $2,695. 
</P>
<P>
Gadabout Tours: Based in Palm Springs with several other Southern California 
offices and one of the largest international travel programs. Part of its 
series includes Australia Rail Sampler, 23 days, $4,125, leaving Sept. 26; New 
Zealand Rail Sampler, 19 days, $3,679, leaving Oct. 18; a dozen European tours 
and cruises, including Grand Europe, 17 days, $2,699, leaving May 30; Orient 
Sampler (Singapore, Bangkok, Hong Kong and one-day excursion into China), 13 
days, $2,274, leaving Nov. 2. Plus cruises in the South Pacific, China and the 
Yangtze River and Far East Spice Islands, including Thailand, Indonesia and 
Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
Giovanni Tours: An agency that features everything from pre-departure tours to 
after-tour reunions. London Theater and Countryside (several spring departure 
dates), eight days, $1,789; South Pacific, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, March 
30-April 18, $4,589; Grand Europe, two 23-day tours leaving June 27 or 29, 
$3,689; Heart of the Orient, 14 days, Sept. 9 to 21, $2,989; Scandinavia, 17 
days, Sept. 20-Oct. 6, $1,589. Giovanni also has international cruises and 
several tours of the British Isles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Variety of Choices 
</P>
<P>
Great Western Travel: This senior specialist has a wide variety of domestic and 
Canadian tours and is a full-service agency representing all major tour 
companies. Offers tours to Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, 
East Germany and Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor Tours and Cruises: Another full-service travel and tour agency and 
specialist in cruises for seniors. Now finishing details on an 18-day, 
eight-country tour of Europe leaving Sept. 2, $1,995. 
</P>
<P>
Trieloff Tours: A wholesale tour operator with a wide variety of domestic, 
Mexican, Caribbean and Canadian tours and cruises. Offers several international 
tours for 1989, including Australia and New Zealand, 22 days, $4,299, departing 
April 8; England, Scotland and Ireland, 22 days, $2,530, departing July 15. 
</P>
<P>
These tour operators sell to the general public and work with many senior 
organizations and clubs that offer international and domestic tours to their 
members. In addition, there are several fine tour operators, also members of 
STRAC, that deal only with senior tour groups. 
</P>
<P>
Also, a variety of major tour wholesalers and special-interest tour operators 
cater to mature travelers. A few work through travel agencies; the others use 
direct mail and toll-free phone lines for information and reservations. 
</P>
<P>
Working through travel agents are: Collette Tours, based in Pawtucket, R.I., 
with an extensive offering of escorted tours to Europe, Australia, Africa, 
China and other international destinations; Insight Tours, with an office in 
Irvine, specializing in motor-coach tours to Britain, Europe and the Eastern 
Mediterranean; Love Holidays, which has widened its primarily Eastern Europe 
tour program to include Britain and Ireland, Spain and Portugal, Morocco and 
South America; and a recent entry, Frames Rickards Tours, with escorted tours 
of Britain, Ireland and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The two major travel/study organizations appealing to mature travelers are 
Interhostel, which offers primarily an international program, and Elderhostel, 
which has some foreign destinations but a wider domestic program. 
</P>
<P>
Finally there are the two biggest, AARP and Grand Circle. The American Assn. of 
Retired Persons has an outstanding program of tours and cruises, all sold 
direct by mail and phone. 
</P>
<P>
Boston-based Grand Circle Travel has an ever-expanding series of international 
tours and cruises and is considered a leader in the mature travel field.

FOR THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
Correction: In a recent column an error made it appear that Great Western 
Travel in Pasadena operated tours to East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland,

NUMEROUS FESTIVALS AWAIT TRAVELERS IN EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Variety abounds more than ever in Europe this year. 
</P>
<P>
Journey in any direction and you can touch on the history, culture, people, 
pageantry and landscape of an ancient country. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, choosing what to see and do can be a fairly painstaking process. 
While it's impossible to name all the attractions, what follows is a brief 
outline of events that will draw travelers in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
France's Bicentennial 
</P>
<P>
The "Bicentennial of the French Revolution" is expected to attract 2.5 million 
Americans this year. One of France's best-known landmarks, the Eiffel Tower 
(built in 1889 to mark the centenary of the French Revolution), will celebrate 
its 100th anniversary with fireworks, shows and exhibits May 13-15. 
</P>
<P>
Bicentennial festivities accelerate in July with a parade of tall ships in 
Rouen Harbor, the inauguration of the Bastille opera in Paris and the opera 
festival in the palace and gardens of Versailles. 
</P>
<P>
Concerts, historical pageants, films and exhibitions will be prominent 
throughout France all year. Featured through April 30 is the centennial of Van 
Gogh in Arles. 
</P>
<P>
The Normandy region will commemorate the 45th anniversary of the Allied landing 
June 6, 1944. To mark the struggle, a new memorial was inaugurated in Caen last 
June. Open to the public, the Memorial of Caen features a film retrospective of 
the area's history 1918-1989. 
</P>
<P>
The French Government Tourist Office is offering two complimentary publications 
to help plan trips this bicentennial year. 
</P>
<P>
A 32-page "Paris" guide lists more than 110 moderately priced hotels, more than 
230 restaurants, wine bars and tea rooms, plus helpful hints for shopping, 
entertainment and transportation. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's Celebrate Together" is a pocket-size guide to the history of the French 
Revolution and major events commemorating the Bicentennial. 
</P>
<P>
To request the booklets, contact the French Government Tourist Office, 9454 
Wilshire Blvd., Suite 303, Beverly Hills 90212, (213) 271-6665. 
</P>
<P>
Down to the Port in Ships 
</P>
<P>
One of the top celebrations will be a yearlong birthday party for Hamburg's 
800-year-old port. A highlight will be the grand opening of the jubilee 
festivities May 3-7 along Port Mile, reaching from Landungsbrucken to the fish 
market. Downriver celebrations are scheduled at Ovelgonne Museum Harbor. German 
and foreign naval vessels will welcome visitors during the jubilee festivals, 
and guided tours will be offered by launch. 
</P>
<P>
More than 250 ships are expected to participate in the "Sail Hamburg 
'89/International" tall ships' meeting July 13-23. 
</P>
<P>
An international ballet festival will be held June 3-26. Theatrical events at 
the International Theater of World Festival '89 will feature dramas from South 
America, China and Hamburg's twin city of Leningrad, and for film fans, a 
Hamburg film festival and European film forum will take place. 
</P>
<P>
In addition Bonn, the capital of the Federal Republic of Germany (West 
Germany), this year will celebrate its 2,000th birthday with a series of 
celebrations, festivals and ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>

St., Suite 2230, Los Angeles 90071, (213) 688-7332. 
</P>
<P>
The Danish Experiences 
</P>
<P>
Like other European countries, Denmark is less expensive in the fall, winter 
and spring months when theaters, concert halls, cabarets and clubs of 
Copenhagen celebrate with music, drama, comedy, opera and ballet. The Royal 
Danish Ballet appears in Copenhagen through May, with the Danish Ballet 
Festival highlighting the season. 
</P>
<P>
Music continues into summer with such entertainment as the Copenhagen Jazz 
Festival (July), Hans Christian Andersen Festival (August) and Aarhus Festival 
Week (September). On July 4 the largest celebration of America's Independence 
Day outside of the United States will be staged in the Rebild Hills of Jutland 
with parades, marching bands and musical performances. 
</P>
<P>
At Copenhagen's Tivoli Gardens (open April 26 through Sept. 10) more than 100 
concerts will be held, many of them free. In addition, the Copenhagen marathon 
run is scheduled for May, followed by yacht races June 23-27.

CRUISE VIEWS: TRAVELERS CAN CHOOSE FROM GLAMOROUS SHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIRLEY SLATER and HARRY BASCH, Slater and Basch are Los Angeles free-lance 
writers. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cruise passenger in the coming months should be in the catbird seat, able 
to choose the perfect cruise from a fleet of glamorous ships. 
</P>
<P>
Last year brought us not only a glut of new and remodeled vessels, but also a 
mind-boggling series of mergers and consolidations that left even the most 
blase industry-watchers gaping. 
</P>
<P>
Also, just over the horizon, three Japanese-owned cruise companies are 
preparing to sail into the North American market in the next 18 months -- 
Oceanic, Mitsui and Crystal Cruises. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concern About Quality 
</P>
<P>
First to feel the squeeze, however, will probably be the small lines that have 
older mid-size ships that handle 500 to 800 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Most cruise companies seem to be concentrating on the "biggest, brightest or 
most expensive ships" ever. However, most passengers don't care much one way or 
the other about the newest design trends; the major concern we hear is about 
the declining quality of service. 
</P>
<P>
Aloha Pacific's U.S.-flag Monterey, still in operation although under a recent 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing for financial reorganization, made a first-class 
try when it began seven-day sailings around Hawaii in October. It was hampered, 
however, by having to train attractive young Americans who looked like movie 
starlets and who were not that enthusiastic about making beds and cleaning 
toilets. 
</P>
<P>
So we should all cheer the splendid new Seabourn Pride, a 10,000-ton vessel 
that made its debut in late December with a perfect staff of Europeans and 
flawless food and service, something rare in a banner year of new ships. 
</P>
<P>
Fares average about $600 a day per person, double, including tips; a sister 
ship, Seabourn Spirit, is due next November with the same follow-the-sun 
itinerary. 
</P>
<P>
The brand-new Royal Viking Sun provides plenty of room to roam with the highest 
passenger space ratio of any of the new crop of ships. It's the first new 
vessel for that prestigious company in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crowning a Princess 
</P>
<P>
The first big new ship due in 1989 is Princess' 1,600-passenger Star Princess, 
scheduled to sail March 24 from Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., for a series of 10-day 
Caribbean cruises before heading north to Alaska. Crown Cruise Line's Crown del 
Mar, a 486-passenger vessel due last November, made its inaugural two-night 
sailing from Palm Beach at the end of January. 
</P>
<P>
Carnival's Fantasy, set to make its inaugural cruise Dec. 11 from Miami to the 
Bahamas on three- and four-day sailings, is the most striking endorsement yet 
for the future of the mini-cruise; this 2,600-passenger vessel is supposed to 
be the most expensive cruise ship ever built. 
</P>
<P>
Next January, Carnival will move the 1,022-passenger Tropicale from its 
longtime Los Angeles base to San Juan, Puerto Rico, replacing it with the newer 
1,500-passenger Jubilee, which will assume the same seven-day Mexican Riviera 
itinerary on April 8, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Club Med Cruises' five-masted, 416-passenger computerized sailing ship, Club 
Med I, originally expected to arrive in time for Christmas, will make its first 
sailing in mid-January 1990, with fares around $1,250 to $2,500 for a seven-day 
cruise. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean Quest's Ocean Spirit, the former Sunward I, a 320-passenger dive-cruise 
vessel sailing from New Orleans to Belize, Cozumel and Cancun, was scheduled to 
set out on its first cruise March 4. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Yacht-Size Luxury 
</P>
<P>
The yacht-size Oceanic Grace from Oceanic Cruises and the 600-passenger Fuji 
Maru from Mitsui are both due in April, while Crystal Cruises' super-deluxe 
49,000-ton luxury Crystal Harmony is due in July, 1990, as is a second Mitsui 
vessel. 
</P>
<P>
Oceanic Grace says its San Francisco-based representative, Guynell Kryzak at 
SMI Group (toll-free (800) 545-5778), begins cruises April 22 with seven-day 
sailings in Japan, China, Taiwan and Korea from $3,395 per person, double 
occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
We'll also see more small luxury vessels in '89. 
</P>
<P>
Norwegian-based Fearnley &amp; Eger, owner of Starship Explorer and North Star, 
both operated until recently by Exploration, are bringing out a series of eight 
116-passenger ships from an Italian shipyard between the fall of 1989 and the 
summer of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
And two 80-passenger Dutch-owned vessels, Rembrandt and Van Gogh, are both due 
in December from Goliath Transport. 
</P>
<P>
Windsor Cruises will introduce two new 70-passenger, 270-foot British-registry 
yachts, Lady Diana and Lady Sarah, this summer that are expected to be the most 
expensive yet at a minimum of $1,000 a day per person, double occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
he Lady Diana will be first on line, due July 1 for a series of Mediterranean 
sailings before a Caribbean winter season. 
</P>
<P>
Another super-luxurious option: West Coast passengers for a 1989 QE2 
transatlantic crossing between New York City and Southampton can add an MGM 
Grand Air Los Angeles-New York City flight for $695 extra. 
</P>
<P>
Rates for the five-day crossings are $1,330 to $8,010 per person, double 
occupancy, which includes return to the East Coast via British Airways or, for 
an additional $995 per person, British Airways Concorde. 
</P>
<P>
For passengers who read the right-hand side of the menu first, there's also 
good news: Cunard's lower fares on the Cunard Princess, already seen this fall 
and winter on Mexican Riviera sailings, and the Cunard Countess, starting next 
September in the Caribbean, are both pegged at $495 per person, double 
occupancy, for some seven-day sailings. 
</P>
<P>
Careful cruise shoppers should keep an eye on three areas -- Alaska, Bermuda 
and the Mediterranean -- for potential spring and summer discounting. 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled traffic to Alaska this summer is down somewhat, only 16 or so ships 
compared to last season's 23. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Savings on Bookings 
</P>
<P>
The intense competition between Princess, with a record five ships in Alaska, 
and Holland America with four, also should produce some early booking and 
advance-payment savings for careful cruise shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
Bermuda, which prunes its visiting ships as carefully as its well-kept gardens, 
has always limited the number of ships that call in a season. For the first 
time in three decades the familiar yellow-and-blue stacks of now-defunct Home 
Lines will be missing, but Royal Caribbean's Nordic Prince will be back along 
with Chandris' Amerikanis and Galileo. 
</P>
<P>
New faces there this season will be Cunard's Sagafjord and the Cunard Princess, 
along with the Royal Viking Star, making a first-ever full season of New York 
City-Bermuda seven-day round-trip cruises. 
</P>
<P>
The Chandris vessels and Cunard Princess will vie for lowest prices -- from 
$799 and $845, respectively, per person, double occupancy during low season. 
The Galileo will sail to Bermuda from Port Canaveral April 8 and 15, then move 
gradually north on subsequent sailings scheduled from Charleston, Wilmington, 
N.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City and Boston. The Cunard Princess 
will intersperse some three- and four-day cruises with its seven-day series. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Newest Hot Spots 
</P>
<P>
Hottest destination for the spring and summer is Europe and the Mediterranean, 
with 36 ships set to sail part or all of the summer there. While the French 
Riviera remains a favored itinerary, the newest hot spots are Turkey's 
Turquoise Coast (all three Sun Line vessels will sail there this spring) and 
the Adriatic coast of Yugoslavia, where Windstar's Wind Spirit will cruise in 
midsummer. 
</P>
<P>
Next winter the Cunard Princess will reposition to Malaga, Spain, for seven- 
and 14-day cruises to the Canary Islands, Madeira and Morocco; prices for the 
two-week itineraries are priced from $2,295, including air fare from New York. 
</P>
<P>
The little country of Belize, lying south of Mexico's Yucatan Peminsula on the 
Caribbean, is a new destination for both Ocean Quest and American Canadian 
Caribbean, whose 80-passenger New Shoreham II sold out its first winter season 
of 12-day cruises round trip out of Belize City along the coasts of Belize and 
Guatemala, further proof that new destinations attract passengers. 
</P>
<P>
In the Orient, the always-imaginative Ocean Pearl offers a new China Dynasty 
program scheduled April through October that will add a cruise along part of 
the Yangtze River and calls in Xiamen and Nanjing to Beijing, Dalian, Qingdao 
and Shanghai.

ROME'S LIGHTHOUSE SENDS SIGNALS TO THE CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Austria.

<DATELINE>
<P>
ROME 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the top of Janiculum Hill is a real lighthouse hiding 20 miles from the 
Mediterranean Sea. 
</P>
<P>
Il Faro (the lighthouse) continues to flash its beam every night from dusk till 
dawn to ships that aren't there -- to a sea that is too far away to be seen 
from any of Rome's seven hills. 
</P>
<P>
What's a lighthouse doing inside Rome? 
</P>
<P>
Although the Romans take the lighthouse for granted and consider it as much a 
part of the city as the Colosseum or Via Veneto, tourists who see it are truly 
puzzled, especially if they come upon it in the early evening when the 
lighthouse is sending out its colored flashes. 
</P>
<P>
It even has a foghorn, but when the sound mechanism works, it can't carry 
farther than three miles. 
</P>
<P>
Forty feet high, the lighthouse is about 300 yards from the main square on the 
pinnacle of Janiculum Hill. Also there, a statue of Italy's Risorgimento hero, 
Giuseppe Garibaldi, reigns supreme and where the crowds gather every day at 
noon to watch the traditional cannon boom, which in itself is a curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overlooks Rooftops 
</P>
<P>
If you walk north along Janiculum's paved, descending roadway the lighthouse 
will be on your right, overlooking Rome's rooftops. No one, however, is 
permitted to enter. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the people who work on Janiculum and those who live nearby are not 
quite sure how Il Faro ever got there or what it is supposed to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
A government official found in the archives a dossier that showed that Italian 
residents of Buenos Aires gave the lighthouse to Rome as a gift in 1920. 
</P>
<P>
Luigi Luiggi, a delegate of the Committee of Italians in Argentina and himself 
an engineer, delivered a speech on Sept. 19, 1920, on the day of the 
presentation to Mayor Adolfo Apolloni and other VIPs. 
</P>
<P>
According to the handwritten text of Luiggi's talk, the lighthouse had been 
offered as a "tangible sign of affection for the fatherland" on the occasion of 
Rome's half-century anniversary as the capital of unified Italy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Vow Beacon' 
</P>
<P>
Luiggi explained that the reason a lighthouse was chosen as a present was not 
necessarily to beam warning signals to craft at sea but to provide a "vow 
beacon," much in the same way a "votive fire" was installed at the tomb of 
Dante in Ravenna. 
</P>
<P>
City Hall documents also show that the original scheme was to flash the flag 
colors of Italy (green, white and red) across the city whenever there was a 
major holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the unveiling, however, city officials decided that the tower 
was to send out its flashes daily, and the order is still being carried out. 
</P>
<P>
Only during World War II was the light turned off because of enemy air raids. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, on the occasion of Rome's 100th anniversary as Italy's capital city, a 
composer wrote an opera in which the Janiculum lighthouse figured heavily, but 
the opera was never staged. 
</P>
<P>
As is the wont of every Roman, the quips began to fly. Said one wit who set out 
to one-up all the others: 
</P>

YOUTH BEAT: VISITING THE HOT SPOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON, Izon is a Canadian travel journalist covering youth budget 
routes. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Soaking up sun on Turkey's Aegean coast, river rafting and riding elephants in 
Southeast Asia, snorkeling on the Great Barrier Reef, absorbing the cultural 
atmosphere of Paris -- they're all hot spots for young adventurers this year. 
</P>
<P>
The image projected in popular Australian movies plus the lack of political and 
language problems have contributed to raise the interest of young adventurers 
in that area of the South Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Young Australians and New Zealanders are such avid travelers themselves it's 
not surprising that many have returned home and opened independent youth 
hostels. 
</P>
<P>
For young visitors it means that even though prices are not cheap, there is a 
large network of services and information that you can use to get the most out 
of your dollar. 
</P>
<P>
In Australia at the gateway to the Great Barrier Reef you'll find the world's 
first youth island. Recently Contiki Travel, the world's largest youth tour 
operator, opened the only resort on Long Island and limited it to guests 
between the ages of 18 and 35. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exotic and Cheap 
</P>
<P>
Thailand has become very popular with young visitors on the Southeast Asia 
route because it's exotic and cheap. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands head out on hiking trips from Chang Mai in the north to visit hill 
tribe villages. Riding elephants and rafting on jungle rivers are usually 
incorporated into the adventures. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that although many go into those remote areas and experience an 
enjoyable adventure, you should check the credibility of local tour guides and 
operators with the tourist office and be aware that malaria is a problem in 
some areas, even if you have taken anti-malaria medication. 
</P>
<P>
South America can be a major challenge to young novice travelers who haven't 
had experience in dealing with foreign cultures. Europe and the South Pacific 
offer well-developed youth services that are a good support system to those 
that haven't had the opportunity to learn how to be "street-wise." 
</P>
<P>
Now, through international financial support, more youth services are being 
developed in South America. For example, in the last several years Brazil has 
opened more than 38 youth hostels. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clean, Safe Hostels 
</P>
<P>
That's important because the hostels not only provide clean, safe 
accommodations (to get the international funding they must meet international 
standards), they also offer good places to network with other young 
international travelers, and to get advice on how to travel and what to see in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been attracting young backpacking travelers with inexpensive 
domestic bus transportation and beds in pensions, on the Aegean coast, for $3 
to $5 a night. 
</P>
<P>
Train travel to Turkey is not covered by the popular Eurail or Interail 
transportation passes. The route most choose to reach Turkey is by boat from 
Greece. 
</P>
<P>
Greece is still a good bet, with beds in youth hostels averaging $4 or $5 a 
night, although some young travelers are discovering that surviving on a tight 
budget is easier on the mainland in areas such as the Peloponnesus rather than 
competing with the large groups of tourists that head for the islands. 
</P>
<P>
Athens is also still a popular transportation hub. Lots of competition has 
added up to some very competitive transportation fares. It's a popular spot for 
young travelers to pick up cheap flights to Egypt and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern European countries have traditionally been the most comfortable 
countries for those traveling on tight funds. 
</P>
<P>
"Italy seems expensive compared with other southern countries," one young 
traveler commented after being charged $10 to $12 for youth hostel 
accommodations. "That's the same price as Switzerland." 
</P>
<P>
"Paris is much easier than London," commented a young traveler who visited 
recently. That's not surprising because through the AJF (Accueil des Jeunes en 
France, a Paris-based service for youthful travelers) more than 8,000 beds in 
youth and budget hotels are available to young visitors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Reservation Fee 
</P>
<P>
The AJF charges no fee to make a reservation. One of its offices is in the new 
building at Gare du Nord (the north railway station). 
</P>
<P>
This year certain Eastern Bloc countries will be more attractive to young 
visitors because they have been added to the system covered by popular 
unlimited rail travel passes. Hungary can now be reached while using the 
Eurailpass, and Czechoslovakia has been added to Interail Pass (for sale in 
Europe only to those who are residents of a European country for at least six 
months). Both tickets sell at special rates to travelers under 26 years of age.

FOOTLOOSE IN VEJER: GETTING A KICK OUT OF A RUSTIC SPANISH TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

VEJER DE LA FRONTERA, Spain 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Time was, and not so long ago, when this country's Costa del Sol was an 
arresting vision of sparkling and sleepy little whitewashed towns along the 
Mediterranean coast from Malaga to Gibraltar. Alas, time and developers can 
change just about anything. 
</P>
<P>
Torremolinos, Marbella, Fuengirola and countless other fetching villages right 
out of Don Quixote have become blighted with high-rise hotels, office buildings 
and other signposts of progress that have brought dispiriting sighs even from 
the Spaniards. 
</P>
<P>
But beyond Gibraltar on the Atlantic side, along the Costa de la Luz things 
have remained relatively stable. Here and in inland Andalusia the white towns 
remain, to remind us of a Spain free of wall-to-wall tour buses, $200-a-night 
"golf hotels" and other signs of the late 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Vejer is one of these white towns (Los Pueblos Blancos), so beautiful that its 
name means paradise in Arabic. Romans founded the village and it was an 
important place during the Moorish occupation of Spain from 711 until 1492. 
Historians say that it was the last completely Arabic town in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Vejer still rides the crest of its solitary hill as it has for 2,000 years, a 
pretty and languorous town where you may still see an occasional woman dressed 
head to foot in the dark robes of Islam, her face perhaps covered with a veil 
similar to the letam still worn by women in Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
To here: Fly Iberia nonstop to Madrid, American and TWA with changes. Aviaco 
will get you down to Jerez de la Frontera, where it is best to rent a car for 
the hour's drive on to Vejer. 
</P>
<P>
How long/how much? Give Vejer a full day and night, with another day or so set 
aside for visiting Los Pueblos Blancos nearby. Accommodations in Vejer are in 
short supply but the prices are downright cheap. Dining costs are moderate. 
</P>
<P>
A few fast facts: Spain's peseta recently sold for .0086, 116 to the dollar. 
Spring and fall are the best seasons for a visit, but even midsummer is kept 
reasonably pleasant by cooling air from the nearby Mediterranean. You won't 
need a car in town, although the streets and alleys are often hilly. 
</P>
<P>
Getting settled in: Hostal Jose Munos Lobaton (Corredera 55; $18 double) was 
entering its second month of operation as a small hostal during our visit, an 
absolutely spotless place with glistening marble floors and pots of flowers in 
the hallways. The lounge has a large window with the best view in town of the 
valley. Take breakfast and other meals at Restaurant La Posada next door, owned 
by Lobaton's brother Juan. 
</P>
<P>
Hostal La Janda (Cerro Clarina; $22 double) is another new one and just as 
simple and neat as the one above. It's at the top of the hill, so the views are 
also marvelous. Rooms are modest but with bright curtains and bed coverings, 
one a mini-suite with sitting room for the same price. The two jovial ladies 
who run La Janda speak no English, but communications don't seem to be a 
problem. Breakfasts are served in the hostal, other meals at a restaurant next 
door. 
</P>
<P>
Hospederia del Convento de San Francisco (town center; $69 double) is Vejer's 
very best, a recently restored 17th-Century Franciscan monastery that is 
exquisite in every respect. Bedrooms have exposed-stone walls, beamed ceilings, 
some with magnificent stone arches spanning the width of the room. Furnishings 
are handsome period reproductions, raffia-framed mirrors at dressing tables, 
baths completely modern. 
</P>
<P>
One of the downstairs salons is lined with choir stalls, new rustic couches and 
chairs upholstered with colorful contemporary fabrics. Walls of the reception 
hall and bar-cafeteria have Roman mosaics from the 2nd Century, an impressive 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
Regional food and drink: Andalusian meals usually start with a fino sherry 
accompanied by a few tapas and always plump and juicy olives, which seem to 
have a different marinade in each restaurant, all delicious. A rather startling 
sight in some cafes and bars is the bowl of rather pinkish lard used to smear 
on toast or hard rolls for breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
Vejer is only six miles from the Mediterranean, so seafood is always fresh from 
the water: swordfish, tuna, clams, squid and choco, a tiny cuttlefish much 
admired around here, are a few of the delectables you'll find on menus. 
</P>
<P>
Like most Spaniards, Andalusians love meat, so plan on seeing plenty of veal, 
game and beef, all prepared in a simple but hearty manner. Ox or bull's tail is 
a particular treat, served in a heavy wine sauce with rice from Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
Provincial red and white wines always seem to go well with local food, but 
they're seldom exported and few make it beyond the region. So have the 
corriente (local wine) or go for a more expensive Rioja from northern Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Good dining: La Posada (Corredera 55), a rustic Andalusian-style place with 
lots of wrought iron, tiles and beams, is just off the La Posa bar, a dozen 
serrano hams hanging from its ceiling. It's a simple but pretty place, having a 
three-course daily menu for $7. Some of the offerings: wild asparagus omelet, 
pescaito frito (a mix of deep-fried fish), merluza a la basque (hake in a rich 
sauce) or garlic prawns, plus several meats. You'll also have a choice of nine 
tintos (red wines). 
</P>
<P>
El Quijole (Cerro Clarina) is another combination bar-restaurant, the latter a 
small but attractive place decorated with wine bottles and old posters. You'll 
find a good fish soup for $2.50, paella for two at $13, mixed fried fish for 
$5.50, a veal fillet for the same. Nothing fancy, and the bar is a local 
gathering spot. We liked it a lot. 
</P>
<P>
El Refectorio (in Hospederia del Convento) has 10 tables in a lovely room 
furnished much like the hotel, with gorgeous fabrics on furniture and fine 
contemporary art on the walls. Start with entremeses, then gazpacho or a cold 
squid salad, followed by sole with sherry, boquerones (fried baby anchovies) or 
one of several meat dishes. The daily menu is $13 and it's the best dining room 
in town. 
</P>
<P>
On your own: Walking this old Moorish town is sheer delight, from the 
still-working windmills at the crest of the hill down to the main Plaza de 
Espana with its palm trees and exotic feeling of Arab Andalusia. Along the way 
have a look at the 13th-Century Church of El Salvador, built in Gothic-Mudejar 
style on the site of an old mosque, and the 10th-Century castle with its 
beautiful patio. 
</P>
<P>
Vejer is not the center of the Los Pueblos Blancos region, but a day trip will 
still take you to the town of Medina Sidonia, where the 13th-Century duke 
governed Vejer and granted its people freedom from the feudal duties of 
cultivating land and raising livestock for its royal rulers. Day trips also 
will introduce you to Spain's oldest city, Cadiz, a lively holiday resort with 
great restaurants and beaches. 
</P>
<P>
History buffs may wish to take the six-mile run down to Cape Trafalgar, where 
in 1805 Lord Horatio Nelson finally annihilated the French-Spanish fleet, 
paying for it with his life as a French sharpshooter found the range. 
</P>
<P>
For more information: Call the Spanish National Tourist Office at (213) 
658-7188, or write (8383 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills 90211) for a brochure 
with map of Andalusia, another on the Costa de la Luz, a booklet of Spanish 
cuisine and a map of all Spain.

DINING OUT IN COPENHAGEN;

<P>
TREATING YOUR TASTE BUDS TO TIVOLI

COPENHAGEN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Throughout the summer, Tivoli offers Danes a wonderland of entertainment, 
including gardens, lake, rides, concerts and 29 restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous stands sell everything from hamburgers to ice cream. Of course, 
sausage or polser stands abound, offering a variety of Danish sausages with 
grilled onions on a roll for about 18 Danish kroner (about $2.65 U.S.). 
</P>
<P>
The stands show photos of various sausages and offer them on small paper 
plates, or with a roll or slice of bread. Many stands also sell ice cream in 
huge waffle cones that are freshly made. They cost 15 to 18 kroner, and are 
filled with what seems like a pint of ice cream. Danish ice cream is one of the 
best we have tasted. 
</P>
<P>
On our first visit to Tivoli, the lights were just beginning to sparkle in the 
early evening. We walked along the gravel paths that wound through flower 
gardens, beside a lake and across a tiny bridge to the Old World elegance of 
the Belle Terrasse restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Packed With Flavor 
</P>
<P>
White latticework lined the walls and tables were set with elaborate 
arrangements of fresh flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Before ordering we were served tiny cups filled with a smooth mixture of tomato 
puree and hard-boiled egg yolks, flavored with fresh tarragon and served with 
crusty rolls. Everything is fresh and, more importantly, packed with flavor. 
</P>
<P>
A freshly made tagliatelle pasta came with fresh mushrooms and sweetbreads in a 
port wine sauce made with heavy cream; and tender, delicately flavored Danish 
venison was served with small grilled tomatoes and paper-thin potato pancakes. 
</P>
<P>
Dessert was a mazzarin tart topped with almond nougat and served in a light, 
lemon-cream sauce. The bill came to about 415 kroner (about $60 U.S.) for two. 
</P>
<P>
Belle Terrasse, which operates only during summer, has been a fixture at Tivoli 
for more than 130 years. Jan Kurt Christensen's family bought the restaurant in 
1946, and he is there every evening watching over the rooms, greeting people 
and talking with visitors and regular customers. 
</P>
<P>
Almost next door and overlooking the same lake, Divan 1 and Divan 2 date from 
the beginning of Tivoli to 1843. Both are elegant restaurants with garden-like 
dining rooms. Divan 1 offers three kinds of herring for 78 kroner, shellfish 
soup for 95 kroner and duck with a honey and lime sauce for 225 kroner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Simpler Fare 
</P>
<P>
Specialties at Divan 2 include sugar salted Baltic salmon in lemon and olive 
oil for 95 kroner, Christianso herring for 72 kroner and lamb stew with fresh 
vegetables for 165 kroner. 
</P>
<P>
For a simpler meal, casual restaurants serve the traditional smorrebrod, the 
Danish open-faced sandwiches that come in every variation imaginable. 
</P>
<P>
At lunch one day we tried the Faergekroen (Little Fairy House), a bright-red 
half-timbered house at the edge of the lake. Hanging baskets of petunias and 
geraniums decorated the outside deck; ducks floated past and from across the 
lake we heard the laughter from the children's Ferris wheel. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant offered such smorrebrod as roast pork with red cabbage for 25 
kroner, smoked eel with scrambled eggs for 27.50 kroner, fried herring in 
vinegar for 20 kroner, steak tartare with an egg yolk for 40 kroner and fried 
Camembert cheese with jam for 27 kroner. 
</P>
<P>
The ham with vegetable salad (25 kroner) came with a huge piece of ham that 
dwarfed the small slice of dark rye underneath. A side salad of carrots and 
peas was served with freshly made mayonnaise. We also tried lobescoves, a 
traditional Danish dish. It turned out to be a very hearty stew of beef and 
potatoes served with rich, slightly sour brown bread (55 kroner). 
</P>
<P>
Groften, a cozy restaurant with large wooden timbers, is a favorite lunch place 
for business people. Specialties include grilled calf liver with bacon and 
onion for 90 kroner and fresh smoked salmon for 60 kroner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Yellow-Brick House 
</P>
<P>
Pafuglen (peacock) is in an old yellow-brick house almost obscured by shade 
trees. A terrace with green and white striped awnings occupies the space in 
front of the building. Specialties include beef in paprika and fish in Noilly 
Prat sauce, at 89.50 kroner each. 
</P>
<P>
Such is the magic of Tivoli that Perlen, a restaurant specializing in a wide 
variety of smorrebrod, including smoked herring with chopped radishes for 39.75 
kroner, herring with curry and apple for 28 kroner, and French Brie with celery 
and grapes for 39 kroner, overlooks a replica of the Taj Mahal with a menu 
serving international specialties. Just a short stroll away is another 
restaurant serving barbecued ribs and hush puppies. 
</P>
<P>
No one should leave Tivoli without tasting the pastries and desserts at the 
Konditoriet. Danish pastry is called Viennese pastry in Denmark. Every 
afternoon, residents come to Tivoli and the Konditoriet for a coffee and cake 
on the balcony. 
</P>
<P>
The procedure is to find a table, afterward get a ticket from the waitress. 
With the ticket one goes to the counter to order one of the elaborate cakes or 
pastries. There is a menu, but choosing from the case is more fun. 
</P>
<P>
Count on spending about $10 to $15 for two, but it is worth every cent just to 
taste the whipped cream. And the pastry we sampled was so light, flaky and 
buttery that it put to shame the concoctions that masquerade as Danish pastry 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
English Spoken Everywhere 
</P>
<P>
Tivoli is open from 10 a.m. to midnight every night from May through the second 
week in September. All restaurants are open for lunch and dinner every day. 
Danes don't often eat formal lunches, so the more elegant restaurants are 
barely full during the day.

The World Indoor Track and Field Championships had a dazzling day as four world 
indoor records were broken Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
High jumper Javier Sotomayor of Cuba, 800-meter runner Paul Ereng of Kenya, 
women's 3,000-meter runner Elly Van Hulst of the Netherlands and women's 
3,000-meter walker Kerry Saxby of Australia had record-setting performances. 
</P>
<P>
Sotomayor, the world outdoor record-holder, matched his outdoor world record 
with a leap of 7 feet, 11 1/2 inches on his first attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Ereng, the gold medal winner at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, surprised himself with 
a sizzling finish in overtaking Jose Luis Barbosa of Brazil and winning the 800 
in 1 minute 44.84 seconds. Ereng, a University of Virginia sophomore, erased 
the record of 1:44.91 set by Britain's Sebastian Coe in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Van Hulst trimmed nearly six seconds off the women's 3,000 mark with a time of 
8:33.82. The previous record of 8:39.79 was set in 1986 by Zola Budd. 
</P>
<P>
Saxby won the women's walk in 12:01.65. 
</P>
<P>
Sotomayor cleared 7-11 1/2 outdoors last September in Spain, nine days before 
the start of the Olympics, but Cuba joined North Korea in boycotting the Games. 
</P>
<P>
So, even though he was ranked No. 1 in the world for 1988, Saturday was his 
first opportunity since the Games to prove that he could beat the world's best 
jumpers. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted this world record very much, just as much as I wanted to win," 
Sotomayor said. 
</P>
<P>
The world records were only part of Saturday's outstanding performances. 
</P>
<P>
Merlene Ottey of Jamaica ran the second-fastest women's 200 with a time of 
22.34. She might have surpassed the world record of 22.27 set by East German 
Heike Drechsler in the 1987 world championships had she been seriously 
challenged. 
</P>
<P>
The expected showdown in the men's shotput between Olympic champion Ulf 
Timmermann of East Germany and world record-holder Randy Barnes never 
materialized, although they finished in the same order as at Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
Timmermann led all the way to win his second consecutive world indoor title at 
71-4 1/4. Barnes had a poor series except for his final throw of 69-9 3/4 to 
finish second. Barnes set the world mark of 74-4 1/4 this season. 
</P>
<P>
Soviets Rodion Gataullin and Yevgeny Egorov, the Olympic silver and bronze 
medalists in the pole vault, finished first and second. Gataullin clinched the 
gold medal with a vault of 19-2 1/4, matching the meet record set by world 
record-holder and Olympic champion Sergei Bubka, also of the Soviet Union. 
Gataullin then missed three times at a world-record 19-9 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
In other finals, Romanian Doina Melinte repeated as women's 800-meter champion 
in a meet-record 2:04.79; West German Helga Arendt won the women's 400 in 
51.52, also a meet record, as Diane Dixon finished second in 51.77, breaking 
her U.S. record, and outdoor world record-holder Galina Chistyakova of the 
Soviet Union won the women's long jump at 22-10 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
The meets ends today with 11 finals.

WHITTIER CHRISTIAN REACHES NEW HEIGHTS, 69-67

<TEXT>
<P>
In a battle matching size and quickness, Whittier Christian's height advantage 
proved to be the difference as the Heralds won their first Southern Section 
championship by defeating Banning, 69-67, in overtime, to gain the 2-AA title 
Saturday at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Scott Ferguson, a 6-foot-7 center, scored the winning basket for 
Whittier Christian when he followed his own miss with a layin with 58 seconds 
left in the overtime period. The Heralds started three players taller than 
6-foot-3. 
</P>
<P>
Banning, which did not have a starter over 6-2, had three opportunities to tie 
the score after Ferguson's basket. 
</P>
<P>
With 38 seconds remaining, center Derrick Paige missed a layup. With seven 
seconds left, David Gray missed an open jumper from the free-throw line. The 
Broncos, who won the 2-A title last season, had one more chance, but junior Don 
Leary's last-second shot fell short. 
</P>
<P>
"We worked hard in preparing to break their press," Whittier Christian Coach 
Bob Brown said. "We had to keep the ball off the floor because they were so 
quick in coming from behind and creating turnovers." 
</P>
<P>
The Heralds (22-6) had 21 turnovers, but their front line combination of 
Ferguson (18 points) and Paul McKinley (21 points) hurt the Broncos inside. 
</P>
<P>
Banning (21-5) was led by senior Donnell Henderson, who scored 19 points, and 
Leary, who had 14. LONNIE WHITE

Santa Clara High School rode a 16-2 scoring spree in the second quarter to a 
78-54 victory over Orange Lutheran Saturday in the Southern Section 2-A 
division boys' championship game in the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The Saints (23-3) shot 57% from the field and limited Orange Lutheran to its 
lowest scoring output of the season with pressure man-to-man defense. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara made 19 of 30 attempts in the first half and led, 45-22, at 
halftime. Center Bubba Burrage made three straight shots as the Saints opened a 
35-17 lead midway through the second quarter, and Orange Lutheran never 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Lutheran (23-4) had averaged 84.6 points per game, but forward Daryl 
Cole was the only starter who played well. Cole scored 22 points, but center 
Pat Bagatourian was held to 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers shot only 32% after averaging 55% all season. Bagatourian, a 62% 
shooter, made only two of 10 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara's 6-foot-5 junior forward Shon Tarver led all scorers with 23 
points, making 10 of 17 shots. He also blocked three shots. TOM HAMILTON

CAPISTRANO VALLEY GOES INTO HIGH GEAR TO BEAT IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was close for a while, but Capistrano Valley High School ran away from 
Irvine for a 76-49 victory in the Southern Section 5-A championship game 
Saturday in the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley outscored Irvine, 14-1, in the first 4 minutes 30 seconds of 
the second quarter, pushing a 14-13 lead to 28-14, and was never really 
challenged. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third time Capistrano Valley had beaten its South Coast League 
rival. The Cougars won the others by one and 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley (24-4) advances to the State Division I playoffs, which begin 
Tuesday. Irvine (24-6) could get an at-large berth in the state tournament. 
</P>
<P>
This was Irvine's first winning season in its 11 years of varsity basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Scott McCorkle led Capistrano Valley with a game-high 24 points on 10 
of 16 shooting. But he was on the bench with two fouls when the Cougars made 
their second-quarter run. McCorkle played just 19 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"McCorkle goes out of the game and they still take off on us," said Irvine 
Coach Steve Keith, who coached Glendale to the 4-A championship in 1985 and the 
2-A title in 1981. "It's an indication of how good they are." 
</P>
<P>
Guards Bill Mazurie and Chris Kostoff added 15 and 14 points, respectively, for 
the Cougars, who led by 10 at halftime and by 22 (59-37) at the end of the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley was able to break the game open primarily because of good 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
However, it certainly didn't hurt that the Cougars were also able to pick up 
the pace in the second quarter and bring a patient Irvine team out out of its 
offense and into a running game. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew our coach (Mark Thornton) wanted us to push the ball up," Kostoff said. 
"I think they got tired out there. We just kept running, and then Scott came 
back in the third quarter and that helped us." 
</P>
<P>
And just to be sure Irvine didn't get any closer late in the game, McCorkle 
sank a jumper and a three-pointer to give Capistrano Valley a 64-40 lead a 
minute into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"We just played really well tonight in all facets of the game," Thornton said.

TRABUCO HILLS IS ON GAME WHEN SWANWICK ISN'T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Throughout the Southern Section 3-A division boys' basketball playoffs, 
opposing teams have done their best to contain Trabuco Hills High School's Rick 
Swanwick, an imposing 6-foot-10, 220-pound center. 
</P>
<P>
Swanwick came into Saturday's championship in the Sports Arena averaging 20.7 
points and 13.8 rebounds per game. Stopping Swanwick was the best way to stop 
Trabuco Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Well, not quite. Corona del Mar limited Swanwick to nine points, but Trabuco 
Hills' perimeter shooting carried the Mustangs to a 59-55 victory in front of 
6,635 fans. 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills (22-6) won by making six of eight three-point shots and making 
nine of 13 free throws in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills' four-guard offense more than made up for Swanwick's off night. 
Chad Poulos scored 14 points, including four free throws in the final 48 
seconds that sealed the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Kriech led all scorers with 19 points, including three three-point shots. 
Luis Arenado had eight points and Tim Manning added seven. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar (19-10), the third-place team in the Sea View League, shot only 
39% in its quest to win the 3-A title. 
</P>
<P>
Center Brian Spratt, who averaged 20.3 points in four previous playoff games, 
score six points going into the final quarter but finished with a team-high 14.

IMPROVING IMAGE AMONG STUDENTS;

ISRAELI TEENS VISIT U.S. ON GOOD-WILL MISSION 
</P>

<P>
With their country suffering a run of image problems, Mikhal Tal and Ami Levine 
took three weeks off from classes to make a pitch for Israel at high schools 
from Santa Barbara to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't been easy. At some schools they found a complete lack of interest, 
while at others they had to explain Israeli government policies that are at 
odds with their own thinking. 
</P>
<P>
But Arab unrest on the Israeli-occupied West Bank and in the Gaza Strip has not 
been the only topic. The 17-year-olds who visited four Westside high schools 
last week, found themselves answering questions about sex, cars, drugs and 
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
They were also asked about the generation gap, a concept that did not translate 
easily at first. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, over here a lot of parents don't understand their kids," one 
University High School student explained. 
</P>
<P>
"Aha," Tal, a Haifa resident, said with a smile of recognition. "That's an 
international problem." 
</P>
<P>
Tal and Levine came to California as part of a 15-year-old program intended to 
help acquaint young people in other countries with life in the Jewish state, 
said Ilan Mor, an Israeli diplomat who accompanied the teen-agers to University 
High in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy-two Israeli high school seniors were chosen for the program after 
passing a battery of written and oral exams. After undergoing a two-week 
training program, the students were sent to the United States, Canada, South 
America and Europe as "messengers of good will," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Frank Discussion 
</P>
<P>
"This is not propaganda in any way whatsoever," Mor said. "The fact that it has 
been going on since 1973, when we didn't have a P.R. problem, speaks for 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that both Tal and Levine were frank about their own 
willingness to give up occupied land for peace, a position that is at odds with 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's determination to resist territorial 
concessions. 
</P>
<P>
"This shows how we're a democracy, and that we can send our students all over 
the world to exchange opinions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With both of them facing induction into the Israeli army, Tal and Levine said 
Israel's sensitive location makes world politics come alive for youngsters 
there in a way that many Americans may not understand. 
</P>
<P>
"The main debate now is whether to keep the territories (occupied by Israel in 
1967) or to establish a Palestinian state," Levine told a social studies class. 
</P>
<P>
"The right wing thinks it must be legally part of Israel. The left wing thinks 
we must negotiate with the Arabs, possibly with Arafat, and a Palestinian state 
must be established. Most of the youth, as well as the adults, are divided on 
this." 
</P>
<P>
But other concerns were universal. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you dress the same as we do?" a student asked. Showing off their jeans and 
sneakers, Tal said, "we import most of our clothing from the United States and 
Europe, so we dress the same way." 
</P>
<P>
Another student asked about class hours, which set off groans of sympathy when 
Levine said he starts classes at the high school near his kibbutz collective 
farm near the Sea of Galilee at 6:40 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Tal and Levine also said there are few drinking problems among Israeli 
teen-agers despite the lack of a minimum drinking age and that although there 
are illegal drugs, most abusers are older than 21. 
</P>
<P>
As for sex, "This is a very high stage in the relationship between a boy and a 
girl. It's not just like that," Tal said, snapping his fingers. 
</P>
<P>
The visit by the Israelis was not the only foreign delegation to visit 
University High School recently, Assistant Principal Thomas M. Rayburn said. 
</P>
<P>
Three Korean students who visited in February stunned students by telling them 
they spend up to 60 hours a week in class, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of interest from our students' point of view both about how 
things work in another country, and how we're similar and how we're different," 
he said.

UPSET BY 'TRIBUTE' TO HOMEOWNER GROUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Developers Find Peace at a Price" which appeared on the front page of the 
Sunday Times (Feb. 26) dismayed me. The recent practice of extracting tribute 
from a developer as the price for settlement of a zoning matter has apparently 
been initiated by Friends of Westwood. This surprises me since the other 
co-founder is Laura Lake, a respected UCLA professor of urban planning and a 
candidate for the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
I have served on the board of directors of the Tract 7260 Homeowner Assn. for 
33 years. We have been involved in sometimes bitter confrontations: 20th 
Century Fox -- proliferation of helistops; Century City Inc. -- Century City 
Specific Plan; Watt Industries -- Century City parking structure; Ring Brothers 
-- condominium height; Days Inn -- design and routing of Orton Stairway; Days 
Inn -- safety of retaining wall, Century City Shopping Center -- noise 
abatement; and Homestead Associates -- neighborhood protection ordinance. We 
have never sought one cent of tribute. 
</P>
<P>
It has been assumed that those representing homeowner associations were unpaid 
volunteers. In the David-Goliath struggles, we have appeared before boards and 
commissions with clean hands to protect the sanctity of our homes. In the 
Homestead matter, we were forced to hire an attorney. We are asking to be 
reimbursed for legal expenses, not tribute. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowner associations are normally nonprofit corporations. The IRS and the 
state Franchise Tax Board might look askance on the large payoffs given to 
Friends of Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
I urge Laura Lake, Sandy Brown, Harald Hahn, and Diana Plotkin to examine their 
priorities and to ensure that money and prestige have not diverted them from 
their primary purpose.

'BETRAYED' IN THE 'LAND OF THE FREE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I survived Hitler and came to the land of the free and the home of the brave in 
1951. My six-unit apartment house in Santa Monica represents the result of 30 
years of hard work. 
</P>
<P>
The Rent Control Board in Santa Monica forces me to rent a beautiful 
1,400-square-foot apartment with two bedrooms, dining room and two baths for 
under $500, while only two blocks away, in Los Angeles or almost anywhere, 
similar or even smaller apartments rent for $900 and more. I am, in fact, 
giving my tenants $4,800 each per year, a total of $24,000 for five apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the house needed a new roof at a cost of about $8,000. Rent Control 
handed me a stack of forms to file a petition -- seven copies -- which revealed 
that I can charge the cost of the roof plus financing to my tenants over 10 
years, or about $11 for each of the six apartments per month. How much will the 
$11 be worth in 10 or even five years? 
</P>
<P>
I may be granted this relief if I can show that my net operating income did not 
yield a fair return. Who is going to determine the fairness? Each of my tenants 
will have the opportunity to see my figures and calculations. Am I still in the 
land of the free? Is it permissible that in a free country my tenants have to 
have knowledge of my financial matters? Can it be just that people simply vote 
themselves my money into their pockets and will not allow me a reasonable 
return on my investment? Last year I had, of course, no income whatsoever from 
my investment, except for my free rent; the roof ate it all. 
</P>
<P>
I am not allowed to let any of my relations have an apartment in my own house 
because I occupy one myself. Am I in the land of the free? No more can I deal 
with my property the way I need and want. 
</P>
<P>
Every 50-year-old shack in Santa Monica that was bought for $15,000 can now be 
sold for $350,000 while the value of my house has been cut in half because of 
the unreasonable actions of the Rent Control Board, which disregards the 
realities of the marketplace. Will the day come when the automobile dealer will 
have to sell to the low-income people at half price? This is what is happening 
to me, except that my tenants are far from the low-income group. 
</P>
<P>
I feel betrayed, abandoned and powerless to fight the dozens of lawyers that 
the board pays with my money.

JUDGE VALIDATES 30 KAYSER PETITION SIGNATURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge on Thursday breathed new life into the 
election hopes of Los Angeles City Council candidate Bennett Kayser, 
tentatively ruling that the city clerk should accept 30 of 99 signatures Kayser 
needs to get his name on the 13th District ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Kurt J. Lewin also instructed attorneys for the city and for Kayser to 
determine by Monday whether they can agree on the validity of 69 additional 
signatures. The city clerk ruled last month that Kayser fell 99 signatures 
short of qualifying, but Kayser maintains that as many as 103 signatures were 
erroneously rejected. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides are scheduled to appear in court again Monday morning when Lewin 
is expected to make a final ruling in the dispute. In the meantime, the city 
has canceled plans to assemble 13th District ballots over the weekend and has 
juggled printing schedules of the so-called sample ballot, mailed to voters 
about a month before the election. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Additional Expenses 
</P>
<P>
"It will definitely cause delays in mailing the sample ballots within the 13th 
District," said Joseph R. Giles of the clerk's election division. "And it is 
probably going to make the election more expensive." 
</P>
<P>
In a written declaration filed with the judge, Bernard J. Barrett, who heads 
the election division, said it would cost $1,000 to reprint ballot pages for 
the 13th District, and $8,100 to add Kayser's name to the sample ballot. The 
13th District includes Hollywood, Los Feliz and parts of Sherman Oaks, Studio 
City, Silver Lake and Echo Park. 
</P>
<P>
Kayser, former president of the Federation of Hillside and Canyon Assns., 
failed to qualify for the April 11 ballot after the clerk ruled that 197 of the 
598 signatures he collected were invalid. A candidate needs 500 valid 
signatures to qualify. Four candidates did qualify: incumbent Mike Woo; Berndt 
Lohr-Schmidt, an attorney; Venus De Milo, a computer consultant, and Zahrina 
Machadah, a business consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty of the 197 invalid signatures were rejected because they appeared on 
petitions that were improperly signed by Virginia Charon, the woman who 
circulated them. Under law, the circulator must sign the face of the petition 
in two places. Charon signed it once. 
</P>
<P>
Barry A. Fisher, Kayser's attorney, and Assistant City Atty. Anthony Saul 
Alperin said that Lewin tentatively ruled during a closed-door discussion that 
the 30 signatures should be counted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Substantial Compliance' 
</P>
<P>
Fisher said Lewin determined that Charon's signature amounted to "substantial 
compliance" with the Election Code. 
</P>
<P>
Kayser, who lives in Echo Park, said he is confident he has at least 69 
additional signatures that were incorrectly rejected by the clerk. But Giles 
said he will not budge on at least 20 of the signatures without a court order.

FORMER STUDENTS GIVE RETIRING TEACHER ALL A'S 
</P>

At testimonials, the food comes with adjectives on the side. 
</P>
<P>
A luncheon honoring science teacher Al C. Rooney, who is retiring after 31 1/2 
years with Covina Valley Unified School District, saw colleagues and former 
students heaping them on: stern, fair, energetic, gifted, inspiring, 
disciplined, dedicated, hypnotic. 
</P>
<P>
Hypnotic? 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Frank Wills nodded. "He almost hypnotized you," said Wills, one of about 
100 colleagues and former students attending the luncheon in Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
Wills, now a watch commander with the Pasadena Police Department, was in 
Rooney's seventh-grade science class at Las Palmas Junior High School in Covina 
in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
"If you worked really hard," he said, "you were allowed to show up an hour 
early at school, to study." Wills' delivery was something like Tom Smothers' -- 
only the eyes belied the deadpan. 
</P>
<P>
"And then if you did well, you could stay in and study through recess, and then 
stay and study after school," Wills said. Then the deadpan cracked, and he 
grinned. "And you thought you were the luckiest guy in the world to be able to 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Facing Cadavers 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn Wong, 24, who organized the event last Sunday, and her sister, Florence 
Wong, 23, amplified on the Rooney brand of motivation. 
</P>
<P>
If Rooney's seventh-grade students memorized the periodic table of gases, they 
were allowed to study the muscles of the human body, and if they passed the 
musculature test, they were allowed to have a fetal pig to dissect, and if they 
did well, they could become part of a select group that went to Loma Linda 
University and dissected cadavers. 
</P>
<P>
A field trip to a dissecting room might seem like a big leap from the standard 
frog, which has aroused its share of squeals and shudders in countless biology 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
"They were draped," Evelyn Wong said, referring to the cadavers. "But I was 
shaking. I was scared. I went back to Mr. Rooney. 'I don't think I can do 
this.' He said, 'What's so scary?' 'They're dead bodies!' He reassured me. He 
said, 'We're all created to live, and we're all created to die, also.' He 
calmed me down. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time I got to medical school, I was used to it." 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn Wong, who is Rooney's goddaughter, says the only reason for her being a 
third-year medical student is "Mr. Rooney. He showed me how to dream big 
dreams." 
</P>
<P>
"He expected so much out of us," Florence Wong said. "It made us more 
motivated, not only in his class but in other classes." Now in her first year 
of teaching first-graders at Ramona Elementary School in Alhambra, she said, 
"I'm trying to be like him." 
</P>
<P>
At 61, Rooney seems imbued with the pugnacious energy of 10 20-year-olds, and 
as a younger man he must have created a breeze standing still. 
</P>
<P>
Decade after decade, he organized the "Crazy Eights" the "Nineties" and the 
"Tams," clubs that met in a small structure in back of his San Dimas house. The 
students sometimes stayed the night. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Rooney and his wife, Margaret ("my partner and my greatest 
inspiration" Rooney says), would take the group on a "mystery trip," a visit to 
a play, or circus, a helicopter ride or to a parade -- which the students 
marched in. 
</P>
<P>
"A teacher has to be dramatic," Rooney said the day after his testimonial. 
</P>
<P>
"I always looked at a child as a potential success. I never accepted any 
student as mediocre. I let them go to their strong suit. You meet their needs, 
and all of a sudden, they'll go to the books. . . . I was able to impart this 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
And he was a maverick, as friends Cal McClane, assistant principal at Las 
Palmas, and Ron Iannone, principal at Covina School, will readily point out. 
</P>
<P>
He was, he agrees. "The paper work? I just pushed it aside." He used to hug his 
students in the classroom, he said, as he hugged his friends at the 
testimonial. 
</P>
<P>
"I never judge people," he said. "I take that kid; we start from scratch. 'You 
and me against the world, we're gonna whip 'em.' " 
</P>
<P>
And, in the same way his students trace their success to him, Rooney says he is 
"the product of the methodology" of two important teachers in his life. 
</P>
<P>
A Pomona native, "I was on welfare, I ran the streets. I was an F student," he 
said. But when he was 12, he had a teacher who told him, "You're not dumb, you 
just don't have the skills," Rooney said. 
</P>
<P>
The idea came as a blinding light: not dumb? It was the signal of a new 
direction. And when Rooney was a student teacher, his master teacher cemented 
his confidence. "He just left me hanging. He was no help, except to say, 'Yes, 
you can do it, if you go home and figure it out.' " 
</P>
<P>
As the climax to Rooney's testimonial, there was a roast. It's hard to put the 
heat on someone when the atmosphere is awash in so much warmth. But they did 
their best. They picked on his spelling and his taste in cigarettes in his 
smoking days. 
</P>
<P>
And Frank Wills took a poke at his choice of profession. "He could have had a 
cult," he said. "Or, if Mr. Rooney'd been a TV evangelist, he would have been a 
millionaire by now."

25 IN NAACP CHAPTER SEEK TO NULLIFY ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL McGRAW, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty-five members of the Beverly Hills-Hollywood Chapter of the NAACP have 
filed a petition with the national organization to have last week's local 
election of officers nullified because of alleged irregularities, members said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The petition charges that a voter eligibility list was altered by certain 
members of the winning slate under supervision of chapter President Willis 
Edwards. Individuals who were not valid members of the branch were added to the 
list shortly before the election, and valid ones taken off, the petition 
alleges. In the voting, incumbent Edwards received 176 votes to rival Connie 
Watson's 112. 
</P>
<P>
"The allegations are not true. There was no tampering of any sort and it's an 
insult to this organization to say that. I won fair and square," Edwards said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, another local branch was scrutinized by the national organization. 
Anthony Essex, the Los Angeles NAACP branch president, was reprimanded for 
unauthorized use of $5,000 in chapter funds. An aggressive campaign is now 
underway to defeat his attempts at relection scheduled for next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Watson, former first vice president and executive committee member, said the 
chapter secretary was supposed to check the membership for accuracy before the 
national officials certified it. However, she said the secretary was denied 
access to the list by Edwards until the night before the national officials 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
One of the petition signers, chapter founder Maggie Hathaway, charged that she 
and other life members were removed from the list. She was allowed to vote 
after showing the election committee a plaque honoring her with life 
membership, Watson said. Branch members are required to pay their dues 30 days 
before an election in order to vote. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards said Saturday that both he and Watson "signed off" on the membership 
list, indicating that things were in order, and that the election was certified 
by national officials. The individuals who were accused of making the changes, 
one of whom was a membership chairman, were in reality doing normal paper work, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards added that an emergency petition, signed by 50 members, was filed in 
October against Watson for alleged "disrespect of the organization and failing 
to follow the chain of command." He refused to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Watson said she had not been told the contents of the petition filed against 
her, but assumed it might be because she wrote a letter on NAACP stationery and 
did not have it reviewed by Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
Neither petition has been heard yet by national officials. 
</P>
<P>
William Penn, a national branch director who supervised the Beverly Hills 
election, could not be reached Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The office of president is not a paid position. Edwards, who has held an 
executive post for 12 years, has catapulted the group into prominence in 
Beverly Hills with a gala annual Image Awards banquet for Hollywood stars. He 
said his main work has been to fight for more black access to the entertainment 
industry.

2 ALIEN-SMUGGLER SUSPECTS PICKED UP BY INS AT LAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two suspected smugglers were arrested at Los Angeles International Airport as 
part of a continuing crackdown on the transporting of illegal aliens aboard 
commercial airliners, an Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Also arrested late Friday and early Saturday at three domestic airline 
terminals were 35 immigrants, who were about to board 12 separate flights bound 
for New York, Atlanta, Chicago and Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Majority From Mexico 
</P>
<P>
All but eight Salvadorans and four Guatemalans are from Mexico, said John 
Brechtel, assistant district director for investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 300 illegal aliens have been arrested nationwide since the crackdown 
began Feb. 27. 
</P>
<P>
Brechtel said charges of smuggling aliens are expected to be filed Monday 
against Erado Fernandez-Martinez, 26, of Buena Park and Jose Lomeli-Perez, 30, 
of Sonora, Mexico. A third man among those arrested at the airport was 
originally suspected of being a "coyote," or smuggler, but evidence against him 
is "thin," according to the spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
He said it was not known if Fernandez-Martinez and Lomeli-Perez were working 
together. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arraignment Tuesday 
</P>
<P>
Information obtained so far suggests that these arrests are "unrelated" to the 
arrest last week of Jorge Guzman-Romero, who was also charged with smuggling, 
Brechtel said. 
</P>
<P>
He said INS officials will seek to have the illegal aliens declared material 
witnesses against the suspected smugglers, who are scheduled to be arraigned 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Immigration officials announced Friday that their investigation has expanded to 
include surveillance of several "drop houses," which reportedly are becoming 
increasingly crowded as immigrants wait for the smugglers to arrange alternate 
modes of transportation.

PRACTICAL DINING IN TONY PARIS

PARIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it comes to restaurants, this is the City of Choice. 
</P>
<P>
It's easy, if you have a bulging wallet, to sample places such as La Tour 
d'Argent or Taillevent, and enjoy an exquisite meal at more than $100 a person. 
</P>
<P>
But most visitors and Parisians find their niche at the numerous smaller, less 
expensive restaurants scattered throughout this vast city. 
</P>
<P>
How do you find the best of these smaller restaurants? How do you know what to 
expect? Most guidebooks don't list them. 
</P>
<P>
Here are a few that stand out -- at less than $15 a person. 
</P>
<P>
For no-frills fondue there is a popular restaurant on the hill of Montmartre. 
It lies just a few blocks from the majestic Sacre Coeur church. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Set Menu 
</P>
<P>
The sign outside reads "Refuge des Fondus," though you will find it named "Chez 
Les Fondus" on the bill. The priorities here are good food and quick service 
with one set menu. 
</P>
<P>
The appetizer (bits of cheese, pickles, salami, bologna, olives and tasty 
chunks of potato in Tunisian hot sauce) arrives with a sugar-laced aperitif 
(cocktail Bidon). 
</P>
<P>
For the entree the choice is either cheese (fromage de Montagne), meat (fondu 
Bourguignonne or Savoyarde) or both. It is best to order both, so try to arrive 
with three or more hungry persons. 
</P>
<P>
You can cook the meat yourself and then dip it in any of four sauces. The bread 
for the cheese, as in most French restaurants, is unlimited. A favorite 
specialty of the place is the red wine drunk from baby bottles (Biberon de 
Rouge), with the opening cut a little wider for easier access. 
</P>
<P>
For dessert, pay a little extra for the sorbet (orange or lemon served inside 
the fruit) or an excellent blend of chocolate ice cream. Pineapple (Ananas au 
Kirsch) comes with the meal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interior Is Small 
</P>
<P>
Make your reservations early and prepare to wait for a seat at one of the two 
long and always-crowded tables. The interior is small and the walls radiate 
with an elaborate, brightly colored mural. 
</P>
<P>
Once seated, food and drink come quickly. The atmosphere is warm and jovial. 
The clientele, mostly young French and foreign students, seems to be naturally 
friendly. What with the close quarters, new acquaintances are often made at 
this self-described "restaurant d'ambiance." 
</P>
<P>
The Asian quarter is in the southeastern 13th arrondissement. In this area the 
streets are lined with Vietnamese restaurants as well as many Chinese and 
Korean establishments, known to prepare the least-expensive cuisine in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese restaurant Hawai is a strong favorite of this neighborhood. It 
is large, with tables inside and out seating up to 150. 
</P>
<P>
Though the proprietor is from Saigon, the 5-year-old restaurant serves both 
North and South Vietnamese cuisine prepared by a North Vietnamese chef. 
</P>
<P>
The clientele are predominantly Asian Parisians. Once seated, the waiter or 
waitress expects you to know what to order almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Soup to Start 
</P>
<P>
The service is exceptionally fast. For a very filling starter, try one of the 
four North Vietnamese soups. The meatball soup (la soupe aux Boulettes de 
Boeuf) is especially good. 
</P>
<P>
Entrees are from the South. The Vietnamese spring rolls (pate imperial nem) are 
delicious as a light entree. For formidable eaters, the hot plate of pork and 
rice (riz au porc grille) or the cold plate of shrimp rolls (rouleau de 
printemps aux crevettes) are recommended. 
</P>
<P>
To top it all off, order the Dessert Vietnamien, a tiny bowl of sweet corn 
porridge. 
</P>
<P>
For a restaurant closer to the center of the city, Chez Hamadi ("Le 
Boutegrille") is a wonderful Tunisian couscous restaurant in the Latin Quarter 
near the Sorbonne. 
</P>
<P>
For 25 years Chez Hamadi has catered to professors and students of the 
Sorbonne, including many North African Parisians. Couscous is a North African 
specialty resembling grains of fine rice and topped with a light sauce teaming 
with vegetables and a meat (mutton, lamb sausage known as merguez, beef or 
chicken) of your choice. 
</P>
<P>
The couscous made by the two Tunisian chefs is of an exceptional quality, 
without the bland taste common at many other places. For starters, try the brik 
a l'Oeuf, a hot pastry dish filled with chopped meat, egg and spices.

BILLS WOULD HELP MANY BUY HOMES; 
</P>
<P>
LOW-INTEREST LOANS, HOMEOWNER IRA AMONG MEASURES BEFORE CONGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mortgages with a 6% interest rate for first-time home buyers, use of a 
tax-advantaged savings account and IRA for a down payment and wider 
availability of low-interest FHA loans are some of the highlights of nearly a 
dozen bills being considered in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the proposals have already been introduced, while others are expected 
to be submitted later this month. All could face an uphill battle, as lawmakers 
try to cope with a variety of other pressing issues and struggles to cut 
federal spending. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these pressures, some housing experts are optimistic that Congress this 
year will approve legislation aimed at easing the nation's affordable-housing 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"This could be Congress' 'Year of Housing,' " said Don Campbell, staff director 
of the Senate Housing and Urban Affairs subcommittee and chief housing aide to 
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.). 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these proposals are going to cost money, but I think the nation's 
housing problems have gotten bad enough that some (lawmakers) are ready to do 
something about it in a big way," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sweeping Legislation 
</P>
<P>
While housing advocates are pleased that so many bills have been introduced 
early in the legislative session, they're still waiting for what some simply 
call "The Big One" -- The National Affordable Housing Act. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, which may be introduced later this week by Cranston and Sen. 
Alfonse D'Amato (R-N.Y.), could be the most sweeping housing legislation 
proposed in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would enhance incentives for builders and investors who provide low- 
and moderate-income housing, and also would provide incentives to encourage 
more state and local governments to improve housing programs in their area. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the federal government could provide seed money that local 
agencies would loan to neighborhood developers, or could guarantee loans to 
builders who produce low- and moderate-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
The bill -- which reflects nearly two years of exhaustive studies and hearings 
-- would also make low-down payment FHA loans widely available to buyers in 
high-cost housing states such as California. 
</P>
<P>
Taxpayers would be allowed to use money in their individual retirement accounts 
to purchase a house and could also put up to $2,000 a year in the tax-deferred 
accounts to save for a down payment. 
</P>
<P>
Many parts of the Cranston-D'Amato legislation overlap other Senate proposals. 
It is expected that most of the other housing-related bills will be merged into 
the Cranston-D'Amato plan to form an omnibus bill "that will deal with housing 
in a comprehensive, big-picture manner," said Floyd Williams, a lobbyist for 
the National Assn. of Home Builders. 
</P>
<P>
Key provisions of the major proposals now on Capitol Hill would: 
</P>
<P>
* Make the FHA program viable in all areas. 
</P>
<P>
Most FHA loans are 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages that require a down payment of 
about 5%. Since the FHA guarantees the mortgage, lenders are more willing to 
make a loan to borrowers who have a small down payment or would have trouble 
qualifying for a conventional mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
But the FHA cannot insure loans of more than $101,250, making the program of 
little use in Southern California and other high-cost housing areas, where much 
larger loans are needed to buy a house. Only 9% of all California buyers last 
year used an FHA loan, less than half the nationwide average. 
</P>
<P>
A bill authored by Rep. David Price (D-N.C.) would alter the program so the FHA 
could make loans on properties whose purchase price did not exceed 95% of the 
median price of homes in the area. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if the area's median price is $240,000 -- as it is in Orange 
County -- a buyer could purchase a house for $228,000 and still be eligible for 
an FHA loan. 
</P>
<P>
Price's bill also would allow first-time buyers to get an FHA loan with a 3% 
down payment. In addition, it would permit the FHA to insure adjustable-rate 
mortgages whose interest rates can move up or down two percentage points a 
year. Currently, the agency can only insure loans with rates that can move just 
one point each year -- loans that are difficult to find. 
</P>
<P>
A similar bill has already been introduced in the Senate, and similar changes 
will be included the Cranston-D'Amato bill. Higher FHA limits have drawn 
support from powerful realty and banking trade groups, and little opposition 
from others. 
</P>
<P>
Housing experts say chances of approving such changes to the FHA program are 
good, in part because it would not cost the Treasury any money. That's because 
a one-time insurance premium that FHA borrowers pay funds the program. 
</P>
<P>
"Any bill that would help more people afford to buy a home without costing the 
government any more money is going to look very attractive," said Paul Feldman, 
Price's legislative director. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 representatives have already agreed to co-sponsor Price's bill, 
Feldman added, and about a dozen are co-sponsoring the companion bill in the 
Senate. "And we haven't even started aggressively pushing yet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
* Use of IRA money for down payments. 
</P>
<P>
A number of proposals would allow home buyers to use money in their individual 
retirement accounts, 401k savings plans or other pension plans as a down 
payment on a home. Now, such money can only be invested in bank certificates of 
deposits, stocks and bonds, and a handful of other items. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Cranston-D'Amato plan, up to $10,000 in retirement savings could be 
used to purchase a house. The money would be considered an investment -- just 
like a bank certificate of deposit -- so the buyer would not have to pay a 
stiff withdrawal penalty. 
</P>
<P>
The bill also would allow taxpayers to put up to $2,000 a year in the tax-free 
accounts to save for a down payment. 
</P>
<P>
A bill in the House of Representatives is less generous. Authored by Rep. 
Gerald Kleczka (D-Wis.), it would allow first-time buyers to withdraw up to 
$5,000 from their retirement accounts to purchase a home. 
</P>
<P>
The director of the National Assn. of Realtors' housing and community 
development committee, Peter Morgan, said the trade group "supports the concept 
of letting people use their IRA savings to buy their first home." 
</P>
<P>
But NAR has yet to endorse any specific proposal in the House or Senate, he 
said, in part because realtors "want to wait until all the proposals have been 
submitted so we can pick the most appropriate ones." 
</P>
<P>
However, some experts say realtors are lukewarm about Kleczka's bill, and that 
the measure could perish if it does not get the realtors' support. 
</P>
<P>
Realtors' biggest concern about the bill appears to be a "recapture" provision 
that would require taxes on the IRA withdrawal to be repaid over the 10-year 
period following the sale of the house. 
</P>
<P>
The Kleczka bill "would make you pay back tax benefits after you've sold your 
home," said a lobbyist from another trade group. 
</P>
<P>
"The realtors say that would set a bad precedent -- that the next thing you 
know, Congress would pass some law that makes you pay back the deductions you 
took for your mortgage-interest payments," he said. 
</P>
<P>
* Low-rate loans for first-time buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The most ambitious bill on this front is authored by Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez 
(D-Tex.), new chairman of the influential Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez's bill would establish a "National Housing Trust" that would provide a 
federal subsidy to first-time home buyers. The subsidies would effectively 
reduce the interest rate on a borrower's 30-year loan to 6%. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez believes the trust could open the door to millions of people shut out 
of the housing market, and most housing analysts agree. Yet those same analysts 
say the bill has a tough road ahead, in part because some budget-conscious 
lawmakers don't like the proposal's $2-billion-a-year cost. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts also say the proposed trust has several flaws. One is that there 
is now no ceiling on the size of the subsidy: The cost of the program could 
soar if interest rates skyrocket, because it would cost the government more to 
keep the homeowners' loans at 6%. 
</P>
<P>
Similar to Kleczka's IRA bill, Gonzalez's bill also has a "recapture" provision 
that would require a borrower to pay back the subsidies when the home is 
eventually sold -- a condition that limits the bill's appeal to some real 
estate trade groups. 
</P>
<P>
While most of these bills have broad-based support, some housing experts doubt 
that they'll be approved in the current legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
"Working out a budget and solving the FSLIC (Federal Savings &amp; Loan 
Insurance Corp.) crisis are probably going to be higher priorities," said 
builder lobbyist Williams. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if you could finish those two jobs by summer, you'd have the July 4 
recess and then the August recess." The session is slated to end in October, 
which would leave little time to complete a big housing package. 
</P>
<P>
Added NAR's Morgan: "I don't think the chance of Congress passing a 
comprehensive bill this year is very likely -- there's just so much else to do. 
If it's going to get passed, it'll probably be in 1990." 
</P>
<P>
Cranston aide Don Campbell disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
"Sen. Cranston is really going to push his bill. A lot depends on momentum, and 
I think it's building," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell also notes that Jack Kemp, the new secretary of Housing and Urban 
Development, has said he wants to begin working to solve the nation's housing 
problems immediately. Many of the concepts in the Cranston-D'Amato bill and 
other proposals may please Kemp, who believes that the best way for the 
government to solve the housing crisis is to offer incentives to spur more 
private-sector involvement.

MOVIE FOLKS 'TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly seven decades ago, a handful of film stars more concerned with their 
colleagues' well-being than with their own careers, envisioned a place where 
those who make movies -- be they mechanics or matinee idols -- could live their 
final years in a spirit of comfortable camaraderie. 
</P>
<P>
From that long-ago gathering came the Motion Picture Relief Fund and its credo 
"We Take Care of Our Own." 
</P>
<P>
As of today, what has grown to be the sprawling Motion Picture Country House 
and Hospital will be taking even better care of its own. 
</P>
<P>
A $25-million hospital and health center is being dedicated at the scenic 
41-acre Woodland Hills facility where one-time stars mingle with scenarists, 
and comics with craftsmen. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's Like a Resort' 
</P>
<P>
The dedication would have gladdened the hearts of Mary Pickford, Charlie 
Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and D.W. Griffith, the first celebrities to 
envision the now-legendary retirement home where anyone with 20 years of work 
in the film industry can spend his or her final years in comfort, regardless of 
his or her individual financial situation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a home, it's like a resort," said Fayard Nicholas, once half of the 
Nicholas Brothers terpsichorean team that tap dance enthusiasts will remember 
for their flying feet and spectacular splits. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholas, now 74, has lived there with his wife for five years "after getting 
tired of being burglarized" in their West Hollywood apartment. Because of the 
fund, he was able to get corrective surgery for a hip condition that once had 
him saying, "I can dance better than I can walk." 
</P>
<P>
Mae Clarke, the still-feisty and fiercely independent star of the 1930s who 
will forever be the gun moll smashed in the face with a grapefruit by James 
Cagney in the 1931 classic, "The Public Enemy," is another resident, as is Hal 
Elias, a former producer and governor of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and 
Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pharmacy, Surgical Suite 
</P>
<P>
But in the main, those that may someday benefit from the new 80-bed, 
three-story hospital addition that will serve the critically ill and the 
convalescing are the electricians, grips, sound technicians, film editors and 
scores of other behind-the-scenes unknowns who made Hollywood what it was and 
is. 
</P>
<P>
The new facility will include a pharmacy, surgical suite, dental offices, 
outpatient medical center, radiology department and physical, occupational and 
recreational therapy units. 
</P>
<P>
The opening of the hospital building is the beginning of a plan that will 
extend burgeoning health facilities and eventually double hospital capacity. 
The eventual cost will total $50 million, of which $35 million already has been 
raised. 
</P>
<P>
Much of money came from those within the industry, from studio heads and 
studios themselves and from businessmen who became more interested in reaching 
for their checkbook after hearing personal appeals for help from some of 
Hollywood's biggest names. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Phones in the Rooms 
</P>
<P>
The capital fund drive was coordinated by producers Robert Blumofe and Walter 
Seltzer and presided over by Edie Wasserman, wife of MCA Chief Executive Lew 
Wasserman. 
</P>
<P>
She has spent 10 years as the unofficial "Mother Superior" of the Woodland 
Hills campus on Calabasas Road and Mulholland Drive, just south of the Ventura 
Freeway, and it was a personal experience that first brought her there. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother was 95, and we were thinking about admitting her," she said the 
other day. "But the visiting hours were inconvenient and there were no phones 
in the rooms and it just wouldn't have worked. So we kept her home, but I 
remember thinking 'there's some things there that need fixing.' So I decided to 
fix them." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the hospital and health center, the Motion Picture and Television Fund, 
which has been at its present location since 1941, now operates a retirement 
village, an outpatient medical center in Hollywood and a state-of-the-art 
Alzheimer's care center. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Psychological Support 
</P>
<P>
Substance abuse programs have been established while the fund provides more 
than 20,000 visits each year to those film veterans who are in need of 
financial or psychological support beyond the constant care given the residents 
of the home itself. 
</P>
<P>
There is a dining room where one oldster complained bitterly that he "was sick 
of steak." There is a theater donated by Louis B. Mayer and a lodge with 42 
rooms given by Samuel Goldwyn's widow, Frances. And, of course, there are the 
58 cottages where most residents live. 
</P>
<P>
"Of all the charities I've ever done, this is the best," Wasserman said. 
</P>
<P>
"If I won $10 million in the lottery," Nicholas said, "I'd give $8 million to 
the fund, keep $2 million and keep living right here." 
</P>

NEWS BRIEFS: STYLES AND REVIEW

<P>
To review or not to review . . . that's one of the questions facing residents 
in Beverly Hills, where many houses either are being extensively remodeled or 
torn down to make way for newer, larger homes. 
</P>
<P>
Under a proposed zoning code, the approval of an architectural review board 
would be required for any "flat front" design, presumably because such designs 
look more bulky from the street than designs that have part of the house set 
back farther from the street. 
</P>
<P>
At a packed council meeting, Tricia Moore said that establishing a review board 
would discourage "traditional styles of architecture that have been around for 
centuries: Cape Cod, French Provincial. . . . There is a whole category of 
architecture that's being removed from the city." 
</P>
<P>
She emphasized that she was speaking as an individual, not in her capacity as 
executive vice president of the Beverly Hills Board of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council decided to calm the fears of those who favor traditional 
exteriors by asking planners to write guidelines for Colonial-style houses or 
others with flat facades to be built without review board approval. David M.

Azusa has approved a $6-million, 51,000-square-foot commercial and office 
complex on 3 1/2 acres at Azusa Avenue and Foothill Boulevard that could 
revitalize the San Gabriel Valley community's downtown. 
</P>
<P>
De Rosa Properties, Bel-Air, which has completed two smaller projects in Azusa, 
received approval from the city to build Centennial Square at the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
Robb Steel, Azusa's redevelopment director, said the project, combined with a 
141-unit luxury apartment complex under way and a rehabilitation program for 
building facades on Azusa Avenue, should encourage other developers to build 
there. David M. Kinchen

NEWS BRIEFS: WESTSIDE GROWTH SLOW

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite all the new apartment buildings going up in Mar Vista, Palms and 
Brentwood the Westside has grown by only about 79,000 since the 1980 census, 
according to a new study by the Los Angeles County Department of Regional 
Planning. 
</P>
<P>
Every Westside community except Marina del Rey -- which dropped from 6,693 in 
1980 to 6,285 in 1988 -- gained population during the 8-year period. The 
Westside's population rose from 966,150 in 1980 to 1,045,425 last year. 
</P>
<P>
County analyst Terry Bills, a Mar Vista resident, was initially surprised by 
the figures, noting that three-story apartment buildings had replaced many of 
the single-family houses: "The data is right. It's simply that when we live 
close to construction, we tend to see it as more pervasive than it is." David

In a first for the Southland, Monrovia's City Council has adopted an ordinance 
requiring owners of mobile home parks who convert the parks to other uses to 
pay displaced tenants up to $5,000 each, or buy their homes.

<P>
Sunnyvale and San Jose in Northern California have adopted similar ordinances 
in the past three years, according to City Atty. Richard Morillo. Monrovia has 
three mobile home parks.

With the major film studios breaking up into small production companies, many

corporate office towers. The result has been a run on attractive, easily 
accessible low-rise office buildings on the far Westside and in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
A development consortium, including a few film producers, are recycling the 
architecturally anonymous Systems Development building at 3000 W. Olympic 
Blvd., Santa Monica, into a distinctive garden office complex, to be called the 
Lantana Center.

Given the success in Griffith Park of the new Gene Autry Western Heritage 
Museum, designed by Widom Wein Cohen, and the new entry to the Los Angeles Zoo, 
designed by John Aleksich, it was only logical that something better than a 
parking lot connect them. 
</P>
<P>
Now being shown to the necessary public agencies and potential private donors 
is "Dream Walk," an engaging pedestrian way softened by furniture, plantings, a 
kiosk and fountains. Featured at intervals of the 900-foot walk would be an 
orientation center to the park, a water sculpture in the form of children's 
toys and an entrance court to the zoo.

"With a steady stream of people, particularly children, now wandering between 
the museum and zoo I thought the walk would make the experience a safer, and

If you cut wood with a chain saw, be sure to position yourself so as to prevent 
the cut log section from rolling. Solo Inc. advises holding the saw on the 
right side of your body, outside the line of sight across the chain. If the log 
shows signs of internal stress -- a bowed appearance -- the operator should not 
cut on the stressed side, since this could lead to pinching and result in a 
kickback of the saw.

Designer Ettore Sottsass, a founder of the Milan-based Memphis Group, 
internationally acclaimed for its New Wave architecture and furniture designs, 
has completed his first project in California, a striking new art gallery on 
Beverly Hills' Rodeo Drive. 
</P>

The most distinctive feature of the Mayer-Schwarz gallery is its frontage. A 
facade of black Marquina marble is punctured by a dramatic doorway made up of 
irregular folds and jagged angles of multicolored terrazzo. 
</P>

The doorway conveys a sense of mystery, as if giving entry to a hidden cave of

GARDEN NEWS: JAPANESE STONE BASINS ARE FOR HAND-WASHING; 
</P>
<P>
YOU CAN FIND REASONABLY PRICED CONCRETE IMITATIONS IN LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
At least one of those huge containers being offloaded by giant cranes at the 
Port of Los Angeles was full of Tsukubai instead of Toyotas. 
</P>
<P>
Tsukubai is the traditional stone basin used to wash one's hands before a tea 
ceremony in Japan, or to wash one's hands while weeding -- a more modern use. 
</P>
<P>
You can find reasonably priced concrete imitations in Los Angeles or buy the 
real rock-solid, granite basins imported by George Yamaguchi. They cost from 
about $300 for the low kinds that require some stooping (considered humble and 
worthy) to $1,000 for an extremely handsome tall one that requires no humility 
at all. Considering what they weight (George is not sure, but they can be put 
in the trunk of the car), the price per pound is pretty good. 
</P>
<P>
There are basins that look like natural boulders, basins shaped like an old 
Chinese coin, basins shaped like a chrysanthemum flower and basins that are 
simply round and elegant. 
</P>
<P>
For those who want to use tsukubai in a traditional Japanese setting, the book, 
"A Japanese Touch for Your Garden," by Kiyoshi Seike and Masanobu Kudo 
(Kodansha International; Tokyo and New York) explains the rules for positioning 
them next to a "sea" of gravel or small stones, with a large flat stone for 
standing on and two smaller flat stones to hold other objects while washing. 
The authors even give the traditionally proper dimensions and spacings. 
</P>
<P>
Yamaguchi has also imported 40,000 pounds worth of solid granite lanterns from 
the small path-side Oki-gata, to the towering Tachi-gata, for those looking for 
a traditional Japanese touch in night lighting. All are available at Yamaguchi 
Bonsai Nursery, 1905 Sawtelle Ave. in West Los Angeles, 213/473-5444. Robert

An Australian import has arrived for Southland gardens. This charming, small, 
blue daisy was a nursery mystery when it first arrived, identified only as 
Brachycome. If you looked up Brachycome in your Sunset Western Garden Book or 
Hortus Third last year, you learned only that this daisy was probably an annual 
called Swan River Daisy. But this new blue daisy was certainly not an annual, 
and adventurous gardeners recognized its long-lasting garden contribution 
almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
This year, we learn that Brachycome multifida is Hawkesbury River Daisy, named 
for the river outside of Sydney. It produces low-growing mounds of ferny 
foliage with tiny yellow-eyed blue daisies and blooms for a long period from 
spring into fall, demanding only good drainage and at least a half-day of sun. 
As a perennial, it needs shearing in late fall and a short rest in winter. True 
to its Australian heritage, it is moderately drought tolerant once established. 
It can be propagated by cuttings. Useful in pots, baskets, or as a low edging 
for borders, Hawkesbury river Daisy is sure to become a Southland perennial 
favorite. Mary Ellen Guffey

The lavender flowers and gray-green foliage of lavender plants are a part of 
all Mediterranean gardens and should be in every California garden as well -- 
for the fragrance, color and a host of practical uses. T. DeBaggio Lavender is 
an unusual nursery doing a mail- order business only in lavender plants, but 
not just any lavender. He sells several special selections, including the 
variety "Grosso," which is the standard commercial variety in France. He also 
sells "Irene Doyle," a dark, heavy-flowering variety, "W.K. Doyle," an even 
darker version, and "Susan Belsinger," a dwarf, 11-inch high variety. His 
catalogue costs $1 and includes a growing guide, from T. DeBaggio Lavender, 923 
N. Ivy St., Arlington, VA, 22201. 703/243-2498. Robert Smaus

Here's a new dwarf shrub that's almost too good to be true. Dipladenia Red 
Riding Hood, a cousin of the beautiful but infamous climbing vine Mandevilla, 
has stunning tube-shaped cherry red flowers, glossy green foliage and sturdy 
growth. Unlike Mandevilla, it grows vigorously and is not stingy with its 
blooms. What's more, insects and diseases ignore it. This new dwarf shrub will 
be effective in a patio pot or hanging basket because it stays compact and 
blooms continuously. Along the coast, it likes full sun; inland, it requires 
some shade from midday sun. If it begins to vine, it's getting too much shade; 
if its leaves become light green, it's getting too much sun. In a pot, it needs 
regular fertilizer and pinching to keep it bushy. Red Riding Hood is available 
at many garden centers. Mary Ellen Guffey

Home buyers, apparently choosing higher monthly payments and lower interest 
paid over a longer term, prefer a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage as their first 
mortgage option, according to a recent study. 
</P>
<P>
The consumer study, by Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate Service, showed 
that 40.3 percent of respondents preferred the 15-year fixed rate mortgage, 
compared with 39.3 percent who would choose a 30-year fixed-rate loan. Eleven 
percent would prefer adjustable rate loans and 5 percent would opt for a 
30-year fixed-rate bimonthly mortgage.

PREFERENCE FOR THREE-BEDROOM HOMES REPORTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The dream house of a nationally representative sample of families polled by 
Professional Builder magazine is a three-bedroom, two-bath ranch-style house 
with 1,900 square feet and an average price of $121,000. 
</P>
<P>
They want brick siding (45%) -- except in the West where stucco is the 
preferred exterior material and the East where wood siding is the preferred 
material; a two-car garage (63.5%), traditional architecture (35.5%), a full 
basement (77.8%) and a master bedroom suite with walk-in closet and a private 
bath. The overwhelming number of shoppers (84.6%) want a detached house on its 
own lot. 
</P>
<P>
The survey in the magazine's December issue is based on 1,072 replies from 
families who said they would purchase a home within six months. Along with a 
separate survey questioning builders about their construction and marketing 
practices, it was conducted by National Family Opinion Inc.

MOST SOUTHLAND VACANCY RATES TO CLIMB AS OFFICE SUPPLY RISES; 
</P>
<P>
DOWNTOWN L.A. REMAINS EXCEPTION WITH EXPANSION AND EAST COAST INFLUX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Strong leasing demand and a dearth of new construction is expected to push 
office vacancy rates in downtown Los Angeles sharply lower this year, brokerage 
experts say, but vacancies in the big Westside market will rise as several new 
office complexes open their doors. 
</P>
<P>
Vacancy rates in the San Fernando Valley will remain about the same, commercial 
brokerage agents believe, and the South Bay market will show some modest 
improvement. But vacancies in the Orange County and San Diego markets -- 
already more than 20% -- could go even higher if leasing activity does not keep 
pace with new supply. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be a magnificent year in terms of demand, but an even grander year in 
terms of new product coming on line," said Dennis Macheski, director of 
research services for Grubb &amp; Ellis Commercial Brokerage Services. 
</P>
<P>
Translation: Vacancy rates in most parts of Southern California are going to 
move higher in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown Los Angeles is more the exception than the rule, Macheski said. Many 
companies already located downtown are expanding, while big East Coast firms -- 
especially those involved in the legal, accounting and financial services 
industries -- are opening West Coast offices. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Short-Lived Prosperity 
</P>
<P>
As a result, said Macheski, today's downtown office-vacancy rate of 14% could 
drop to 9% by the end of the year. But that prosperity could be short-lived. 
Rates could approach 20% by 1991, when several projects under construction 
finally open. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a possible office glut in the early 1990s, the health of the downtown 
Los Angeles office market stands in marked contrast to many other major 
Southland markets. Here is how those other big office markets are expected to 
fare this year, and a glimpse of what's ahead: 
</P>
<P>
West Los Angeles: Several projects that were approved before Los Angeles voters 
passed the growth-cutting Proposition U in 1986 are opening this year or next. 
As a result, vacancy rates in the West Los Angeles/Mid-Wilshire area are 
expected to climb from about 12% today to 14% by the end of the year and could 
hit 16% in 1990, according to John Knott, a broker and vice president in 
Cushman &amp; Wakefield's Westside office. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the rising vacancy rate, rents have been moving sharply higher -- as 
much as 15% a year in some areas -- because "the Westside is still a very 
glamorous area to have your offices and its location is terrific," Knott said. 
</P>
<P>
"Tenants are more cautious about taking on additional space commitments today 
than they were two or three years ago because of the higher rents, but it's 
still a strong market." 
</P>
<P>
South Bay: This market's vacancy rate stands at about 24%, a legacy of its 
building boom in the earlier part of the decade and cutbacks by big 
office-users in the aerospace and defense industry. 
</P>
<P>
"But the worst seems to be over," said Mike Condon, a vice president and broker 
in the South Bay office of The Seeley Co. He believes rates could fall to about 
18% by the end of this year and to 15% by 1991, thanks to a near halt in new 
construction, the growing presence of Pacific Rim companies and the increasing 
number of firms relocating from West Los Angeles in order to reduce their rent 
by about 30%. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando Valley: Vacancy rates in this market are expected to remain near 
their current 12% level through most of this year and into 1990, as new office 
space continues to be absorbed by two types of companies: professional firms 
that concentrate on serving only local clients, and larger companies that 
eschew the glamour of a downtown address in favor of the Valley's lower rents. 
</P>
<P>
"Absorption is fairly strong and new construction is dropping," Macheski said. 
"All in all, it looks like a wash for this year and next." 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena/Glendale: These two cities have combined to form one of the 
Southland's fastest-growing office markets. By next year, according to Grubb 
&amp; Ellis, the two will have a combined 7 million square feet of office 
space. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena's vacancy rate, currently at 9%, is expected to rise sharply within 
the next 12 months as several new projects open. Glendale's vacancy factor is 
already 16%, but few brokers are worried: It's already the third-largest 
financial center in California (behind Los Angeles and San Francisco) and 
continues to attract large lending institutions and other financial-services 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County: The county's vacancy rate is already about 23%, and it could 
rise slightly this year "as a humongous amount of new office space comes on 
line," Macheski said. A whopping 5.2 million square feet is expected to open in 
1989, four times the amount expected in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Macheski said that all the new construction, combined with projects yet to 
open, will keep Orange County's office vacancy rate above the 20% mark for four 
or five years. That means rents will rise little, if at all, between now and 
the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
"Long-term, the picture is brighter," he said. "There's a lot of anticipation 
that (future) slow-growth initiatives will slow construction in the early '90s, 
so owners in the late '90s will reap large rewards." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego: The downtown vacancy rate of about 12% could rise as high as 18% by 
early next year, as several new office projects open their doors. Rates in the 
county's suburban markets range from 15% to 25%, according to Winston Elton, 
principal of the Goodkin Real Estate Consulting Group in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Vacancies in San Diego's suburban markets could get even worse over the next 
few years, as downtown owners offer attractive deals to lure tenants away from 
outlying areas. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't save much money by renting in the suburbs anymore, and all things 
being equal, most tenants would rather be downtown," said Elton. "The downtown 
projects are sucking tenants out of the suburbs like a vacuum cleaner, and it's 
a trend that should really take hold when we see all the new (downtown) 
projects open over the next year or two." 
</P>
<P>
Riverside/San Bernardino: Analysts do not pay too much attention to the Inland 
Empire's vacancy rate -- currently about 24% -- because it is subject to wild 
fluctuations. That's because the entire area has but 2.4 million square feet of 
office space, a mere fraction of the space in neighboring counties. 
</P>
<P>
"If a couple of big buildings or big leases get signed, the area's vacancy rate 
changes dramatically," Macheski said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Macheski and other analysts are bullish on the Inland Empire's future, 
in part because both rents and land prices there are much lower than those in 
other parts of the Southland. Demographics are also working in the area's 
favor: It's population began to mushroom in the late 1970s, and rapid 
population growth is usually followed about 15 years later by a boom in 
office-construction. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura: Like the Inland Empire, Ventura County's office market is in its 
infancy and is dominated by smaller companies that take relatively small 
amounts of space. Its vacancy rate of 16% is expected to approach 20% within a 
year, as several new projects open. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Kiefer, senior office broker in the Oxnard office of Grubb &amp; Ellis, is 
not worried about overbuilding. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the firms that are already here are expanding, and a lot of high-tech 
and light-industrial companies are moving out here from the San Fernando Valley 
and West Los Angeles because they can cut their rent by 35% or 40%," he said.

REVENUES SOARS AS A-M HOMES MARKS FIRM'S 10TH ANNIVERSARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This year marks the 10th anniversary of A-M Homes, a Santa Barbara-based home 
builder that has grown from annual revenues of $1 million in 1979 to an 
estimated $171 million in revenues for 1988. 
</P>
<P>
With 24 developments under way in both Northern and Southern California and in 
Arizona, A-M Homes -- the name comes from the last names of founders James B. 
(Bart) Araujo and Michael Muench -- is a major player in one of the most 
competitive housing markets in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
It's also a company with plenty of capitalization, especially since last 
October, when Jennings Industries Ltd. of Australia provided additional capital 
of more than $25 million to A-M. 
</P>
<P>
Muench said the infusion of capital will strengthen A-M's position in home 
building, especially in California. 
</P>
<P>
A-M Homes ranked 80th nationally on the "Builder 100" published last year by 
Builder magazine, a trade publication. The firm's total 1987 sales volume was 
$144.7 million.

VENTURA COUNTY: INCENTIVES NEEDED TO LURE WORKERS TO VENTURA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
VENTURA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Firms used to move to Ventura County because land was cheaper than in Los 
Angeles and Orange County and employees could afford homes. 
</P>
<P>
But times have changed and today the median cost of a resale home in Ventura 
County exceeds $234,000, making the county the second highest market in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, local business are turning increasingly to innovative housing and 
relocation benefits in attempts to recruit and retain workers. 
</P>
<P>
Incentives range from one-time cash bonuses to low-cost housing loans to paying 
the difference in housing taxes or mortgage interest rates between the old home 
and the new. 
</P>
<P>
One hospital in Ventura County has purchased homes and apartments which it 
rents to certain skilled employees at below-market rates. 
</P>
<P>
Only a handful of Ventura County companies offer big-ticket housing assistance, 
but many more say high home costs pose a threat to recruitment, and eventually 
may drive existing employees out of the county. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the single biggest headache we have and there's no easy solution," said 
John Huddy, president of Riklis Broadcasting, which owns Oxnard TV station 
63-KADY. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Disaster Zone 
</P>
<P>
Huddy said he flies out potential employees who fall in love with Ventura's 
palm trees, beach and fresh air. 
</P>
<P>
"Then the applicant looks at housing costs and finds it horrifying. We get a 
sheepish call . . .," Huddy said. 
</P>
<P>
Some firms have declared Ventura County -- where housing costs rose 28% last 
year -- the real estate equivalent of a disaster zone. 
</P>
<P>
Proctor &amp; Gamble has designated the area as one of seven nationwide where 
employees can qualify for extra housing assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the plight of Al Austen, who recently transferred from a P&amp;G plant 
in Pennsylvania to become a manager at P&amp;G's paper products plant in 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
In Dalton, Pa., Austen owned a two-story, colonial-style home on a half-acre of 
land. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A 'Heart-Stopper' 
</P>
<P>
When he moved to Thousand Oaks last November, he traded it in for a one-story 
tract home on a quarter-acre that cost $120,000 more than the home he left 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though people prepare you for it, the cost of housing is a heart-stopper. 
I never dreamed I'd be paying that much," he said ruefully. 
</P>
<P>
P&amp;G tries to help by making interest-free loans available in certain cases 
to relocating homeowners who can't afford down payments. The loan is repaid 
over five years and in exchange, the firm shares in the equity build up of the 
home, spokesman Bob Paulger said. 
</P>
<P>
Housing experts say such help is crucial if firms want to retain key personnel. 
Runzheimer International, a management consulting firm that specializes in 
relocation, found that already, 39% of employees resist transfers to the Los 
Angeles area because of the scarcity of affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
"Employer-assisted housing is cheaper than wage increases and more valuable," 
says David C. Schwartz, director of the American Affordable Housing Institute 
at Rutgers University. "We're finding tremendous interest in the business 
community and labor unions." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Superintendent Quit 
</P>
<P>
Barry Hammitt, the executive director of the Public Employees Assn. of Ventura 
County, which represents 6,500 workers, agreed. He said that finding people to 
run the county government -- from landfill engineers to transportation planners 
-- poses an increasing problem. 
</P>
<P>
Last year for instance, the county lost its Ventura Unified School District 
superintendent because the man could not afford the home he wanted despite an 
$85,000 salary. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's a factor for people at my income level, what about for people coming 
in at levels significantly lower, at the beginning of their careers?," says 
Jack Gyves, who is now superintendent of the Napa Valley School District. 
</P>
<P>
The question is echoed in boardrooms throughout the county. Some firms have 
come up with at least partial answers. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron greases the path to Ventura by offering cash bonuses of up to $30,000 
for home-owning and salaried employees who relocate from the depressed Texas 
market. The firm also pays closing costs on homes and provides bridging loans 
for employees who buy new homes before they sell their old ones. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spouses Find Jobs 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody goes into culture shock when they go from a low- to a high-priced 
housing market. You do a lot of soul searching," says Linda Sheldon, a human 
resources representative at Chevron USA. 
</P>
<P>
Sheo suffered a few pangs herself when Chevron relocated her from Midland, 
Tex., to Ventura last year and she traded a "dream home" for a condo at a 
$17,000 loss. 
</P>
<P>
Amgen, a Thousand Oaks biotech firm, will help spouses of employees find local 
jobs and will consider hiring those with applicable skills, says vice president 
of human resources Bill Puchlevic. In some cases, Amgen will also offer 
employees home loans at several points below market rates. 
</P>
<P>
One of the county's most progressive housing assistance plans is that of 
Ventura's Community Memorial Hospital, which bought three homes and one 
four-unit apartment building within walking distance of the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital rents them at up to $200 below-market cost to employees with 
difficult-to-find skills and doesn't require a security deposit or first 
month's rent, says Executive Director Dr. Michael D. Bakst. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
County's Tax Base 
</P>
<P>
"We hope the money they save will give them a nest egg to get started," Bakst 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For some firms, the answer lies in expanding elsewhere. GTE and Patagonia, a 
manufacturer of outdoor equipment, recently opted to relocate divisions outside 
of California, in part because of high housing costs. 
</P>
<P>
This alarms Ventura County's business community, which foresees ominous 
implications for the county's tax base. 
</P>
<P>
Business leaders say the answer may lie in a joint effort by business and 
government. New Jersey, for instance, is considering a law that would offer 
companies a $1 incentive for every $3 they spend on employee housing benefits, 
says Schwartz of the Affordable Housing Institute, who is also a state 
assemblyman. 
</P>
<P>
"Employee-assisted housing is the solution to America's moderate-income housing 
crisis," Schwartz said. "If employers don't do it, who will?"

HISTORIC BARNS ARE GETTING OVERDUE ATTENTION; 
</P>
<P>
ARCHITECTURAL GEMS OR LOCAL LANDMARKS, RELICS ARE BEING REHABBED ACROSS U.S.

<P>
Great barns are an important part of the rural landscape. They are familiar 
landmarks that speak of seedtime and harvest, of hay and horses, milk and 
memories. 
</P>
<P>
Many barns in the United States represent the building traditions of settlers 
from many other parts of the world. Numerous ethnic groups came to be 
identified by their distinctive old-country barn types. 
</P>
<P>
In the Midwest, for instance, the English three-bay barns and German 
cantilevered barns were until recently viewed as curiosities or relics of a 
vanishing era. 
</P>
<P>
Now, through the "Barn Again!" program of the National Trust for Historic 
Preservation, barns are getting long overdue attention. Farmers are finding out 
how outdated barns can be economically rehabbed and put back to good use. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Architectural Significance "Historic" generally refers to barns more than 50 
years old. Many have architectural significance. Some are important local 
landmarks or are valued for their contribution to agricultural history or 
technology. The National Register of Historic Places lists 2,599 entries 
defined as "resources that were historically functional as agricultural 
buildings." 
</P>
<P>
Others are appreciated for the visual impact they make and for their 
contribution to regional tourism. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you imagine driving through lush farming areas and seeing only low modern 
metal barns, and almost no complete homesteads with their original and 
distinctive barns?" asks Janis King, a "Barn Again" convert from Knoxville, 
Ill. 
</P>
<P>
"Huge numbers of barns, granaries, and other structures -- many of them 
historically significant -- were being torn down, victims of obsolescence, 
neglect, and a trend to new metal barns," says Mary Humstone, "Barn Again!" 
project director and program associate of the National Trust's mountains/plains 
regional office in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw many good barns going to waste on farms and ranches all across the 
country," Ms. Humstone reported to the recent annual conference of the National 
Trust, held in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Put Them Into Use 
</P>
<P>
"We figured that as preservationists we had the kind of expertise that could 
help save these buildings and put them back into use, thus saving farmers money 
and benefiting rural communities as well as the public as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
Some daunting facts were faced. Farming had changed drastically in the last 50 
years. A typical farm of 1920 had many buildings: a hog barn, a chicken coop, 
small granaries, machine sheds, large barns for livestock and hay. Today, many 
farms specialize in one crop or one product, and modern farmers want efficient, 
modern buildings. Although barns seem to survive as long as the land is in some 
form of agricultural production, there are far fewer farms today than a half 
century ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Sweeping technological changes, farm abandonment, climatic conditions, and 
urban encroachment threaten rural resources as never before," Humstone points 
out, "so we must somehow make preservation easy, understandable, practical, and 
cost-effective." 
</P>
<P>
The "Barn Again!" program, she explains, was developed in response to a need 
for ideas and technical information for preserving older farm buildings, and 
for blending economic development and historic preservation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worth Preserving 
</P>
<P>
Editors at Successful Farming magazine in Des Moines agreed with the trust that 
historic barns could, and should, be adapted for modern agriculture, and that 
they were treasures worth preserving. In 1987 a national "Barn Again!" 
competition was launched, jointly sponsored by the National Trust and 
Successful Farming, with financial support from John Deere &amp; Co. and 
Pioneer Hi-Bred International, two major agricultural corporations. 
</P>
<P>
More than 500 farmers from 34 states responded with entries. Their barn 
rehabbing projects ranged in cost from $300 to major $100,000 overhauls. 
</P>
<P>
Eighty-five winners were selected on the basis of innovation, practicality, 
cost-effectiveness, and good preservation practices. Traditional uses for the 
restored barns varied from hay and hogs to grain storage, machinery sheds, 
shops, and dairies. Diversified barn-use enterprises included the selling of 
Christmas trees, growing mushrooms, housing a farmer's market, and use as a 
square dance hall. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the farmers and their families did the work themselves in pay-as-you-go 
phases. For instance, Tim and Catherine Broer of Iowa Falls, Iowa, renovated a 
1940s-vintage barn for farrowing. Kevin and Anna Heuiser of Sikeston, Mo., 
turned an unused dairy barn into a modern machine shop. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Winners Announced 
</P>
<P>
Tim and Martha Manchester of Lakeview, Ohio, converted a 1908 round barn into a 
soybean seed-cleaning and storage facility. And Stewart and Judith Schlafer of 
Stockton, Ill., are using a renovated 100-year-old horse barn for dairy cows. 
</P>
<P>
The 85 winners, announced last summer, spent an average of $11,400 on their 
rehabs, and each demonstrated that old farm buildings could indeed be adapted 
to the needs of modern agriculture. Four demonstration barn projects in various 
areas were used to test creative solutions for reuse, and to illustrate 
preservation techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Janis and Ted King, who operate a 369-acre grain and livestock farm near 
Knoxville, Ill., sought the assistance of the National Trust in making their 
enormous 1865 barn a demonstration project for the "Barn Again!" program. With 
the help of barn restorer Dave Clolek, as well as the state historic 
preservation agency, a barn architect and engineer, the essential renovation 
was accomplished for $8,725, plus another $2,500 to wash and paint the barn. 
The project included restoring the crumbled foundation, raising the hayloft, 
fortifying the flooring and the roof, jacking up the barn, and replacing broken 
windows and rotted sills. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. King notes that the barn has always stood as a landmark in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"During our four-week 'demonstration' period we had over 500 visitors to the 
barn from five states," she says. "We still have people driving in off the road 
every week just to admire the great restored barn." 
</P>
<P>
The Swobodas -- Irene and Jim -- spent less than $1,000 to restore their 
84-year-old barn (also a demonstration project) in Chippewa County, Wis. They 
did all the work themselves. They patched the roof with cedar shingles; they 
spent $400 on lumber and hardware to build sliding doors, and $250 for paint to 
brighten the barn's exterior.

THE BOOK TRADE: THE YEAR OF THE YOUNG READER

There is a cheerful spirit to the posters, buttons and bookmarks springing up 
in libraries, schools and bookstores around the country. But the purpose behind 
these displays, and the workshops, read-ins and author appearances that 
accompany them is far from frivolous. This is the Year of the Young Reader, a 
campaign launched jointly by the Center for the Book and the Children's 
Literature Center in the Library of Congress, and supported resoundingly by 
book publishers, booksellers, educators and librarians. The effort is intended, 
said John Cole at the Center for the Book in Washington, "to focus attention on 
the importance of getting young people familiar with books and reading at the 
earliest age." 
</P>
<P>
"Libraries, public schools, private schools, day care centers, bookstores -- 
anybody that has anything to do with children or reading can pick up the ball 
and run with it," Janie Coats, of the Children's Literature Center, said. 
</P>
<P>
Inspired by the successful 1987 Year of the Reader program, the young reader 
project seizes also on a growing awareness of the literacy problems faced by 
many young Americans. A high school diploma is no guarantee of reading skills, 
since in some areas, nearly half a graduating class may be borderline 
illiterate. One study cited by the Library of Congress found that fewer than 
half of the 17-year-olds surveyed could comfortably read a newspaper. Cutbacks 
in library funding that have forced some libraries to reduce hours or days of 
operation as well as after-school projects have caused additional alarm. Many 
educators worry that though young people can read, they simply choose not to. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody assumes that kids today are learning to read," said Betty Takeuchi, 
a co-founder of the Southern California Project for the Year of the Young 
Reader, "and they're not." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the YYR activities are promotional: public service announcements 
featuring actor LeVar Burton acting as "host/spokesperson," for example. There 
are "camera-ready" logos with the slogan, "Give Us Books, Give Us Wings." And 
the Library of Congress has issued kid-size, four-color "Readin' and Rollin' " 
T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
Public and private sectors are working together, however, to ensure that the 
campaign has substance as well as pizazz. "There's really good stuff happening 
all over the country," Cole said. In Florida, for example, newborn babies in 
Dade County leave the hospital with YYR book packs that include a read-along 
guide, an audiotape for the baby and tiny "Love Me, Read to Me" T-shirts for 
the budding bibliophile. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, two dozen authors and illustrators of children's books 
will gather at a school in San Gabriel in May as one of at least 10 major 
public events planned in conjunction with the Year of the Young Reader. 
Takeuchi, the owner of the San Marino Toy and Book Co. and president of the 
Assn. of Booksellers for Children, said another element of the YYR campaign in 
Southern California would feature members of the Dodgers appearing in spot 
television announcements to describe their favorite reading material as 
children. 
</P>
<P>
With many of the principals on the Southern California committee coming from 
the educational management community, Takeuchi said other projects would focus 
on reading skills for homeless children, pregnant teen-agers and gang members. 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco, a daylong multimedia extravaganza to kick off the YYR effort 
there nearly overwhelmed its organizers with its success. Only 200 people had 
been expected. For lack of space, YYR committee members reluctantly had to cut 
off admission tickets at 500. 
</P>
<P>
In Takeuchi's view, one of the long-term benefits of the project has been the 
linking of so many aspects of the children's book community. "We've brought 
together all these different groups," she said. "Usually we don't all work 
together like this." 
</P>
<P>
She said the enthusiasm had grown so high that participants have already agreed 
that the Year of the Young Reader will not be a one-shot event. "This will be a 
model year," Takeuchi said. "This will continue." Some kind of a public 
document, a "manifesto," as Takeuchi called it, will be issued at the end of 
the year, she said, outlining how the lessons from this Year of the Young 
Reader can be extended. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year can be the Year of the Young Reader," Takeuchi said. 
</P>
<P>
Here in New York, meanwhile, Scholastic Books would no doubt be thrilled to 
extend the YYR program indefinitely, provided it can continue to issue the same 
YYR bookmark. Scholastic art director Carol Gildar said the publisher nearly 
ran into serious problems when it invited employees to bring their kids in to 
pose for an illustration of happy little kids, happily reading. Gildar's one 
stipulation was that the kids had to be able to sit up. 
</P>
<P>
But hey, even publishing parents can turn into stage moms when there is the 
possibility of stardom for their precious little ones. More than one 
beach-ball-phased kid, too young to do anything but lie on the floor and look 
unhappy about it, was brought in while an anxious mom stood nearby and insisted 
that the child knew how to sit up. Thankfully, nine sitting-up babies managed 
to finish the shoot without spitting up. Only one child is shown eating a book. 
This, presumably, is the ultimate solution to illiteracy. 
</P>
<P>
SATANIC BOMBINGS. On Feb. 28, at 4:30 a.m., Cody's Books, Berkeley, was 
firebombed. Damage was minimal, according to owner Andy Ross. A second bomb was 
discovered and defused during cleanup after the first. A Waldenbooks outlet in 
Berkeley was also bombed on the same day, as was the New York City weekly 
newspaper Riverdale Press, which had published an editorial endorsing Salman 
Rushdie's "The Satanic Verses." Ross speculated that the bombings were 
connected with earlier attacks on the book. "I can't imagine any other reason 
why people would be lobbing bombs through bookstores," Ross said.

JERUSALEM PRIZE. Argentine writer Ernesto Sabato is the winner of this year's 
Jerusalem Prize, to be presented at the Jerusalem International Book Fair, next 
Sunday through March 18. In 1973, Sabato, a novelist, who holds a Ph.D. in 
physics, was chosen to head his country's committee investigating the 
whereabouts of the "missing persons," or desapercidos. He is the 14th winner of 
the prize created in conjunction with the Jerusalem Book Fair, which this year 
expected the participation of 1,000 publishers from 40 countries.

DRINKING NEVER AFFECTED WORK, TOWER DECLARES 
</P>

<P>
Past bouts of heavy drinking "didn't impact on my work," Defense 
Secretary-designate John Tower declared in an interview, adding: "When I'm 
under stress, in times of crisis, working against deadlines, I don't drink at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
"You've heard about people who drink under stress. I don't. . . . That is not 
the mark of someone who is alcohol-dependent," Tower said, complaining that too 
much has been made of his involvement with alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Tower, his prospects for Senate confirmation dwindling with the continuing loss 
of support from undecided Senate Democrats, discussed the increasingly bitter 
struggle over his nomination in an interview at the Pentagon with reporters 
from The Times and three other major newspapers. The 35-minute interview was 
conducted Friday but embargoed for release today. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Presented as Victim 
</P>
<P>
The interview was part of a stepped-up campaign by the White House and Senate 
Republicans to present Tower as the victim of a partisan vendetta by Democrats 
who bear grudges from past battles with the former Texas senator and want to 
deny him the powerful Cabinet post. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some people in the Senate who just do not want me to be secretary of 
defense -- period -- and are prepared to embrace any plausible excuse for 
voting against me," Tower said. 
</P>
<P>
In a subdued but forceful defense of his nomination, Tower discussed the three 
areas on which his fitness for the top Pentagon post has been challenged: 
allegations of womanizing, excessive drinking and close ties to major defense 
contractors. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that what he called the "dedicated opposition" of Senate Armed 
Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) has made his struggle for Senate 
approval an uphill battle. 
</P>
<P>
But he repeated earlier complaints that his opponents are judging his fitness 
for the top Pentagon post on shifting grounds and by tougher standards than 
those applied to Cabinet secretaries or even presidents in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Tower called the confirmation process "tantamount to a public trial" and 
expressed bitterness that many of his former colleagues appear to give the 
allegations of "anonymous accusers" more weight than their own observations of 
his performance in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Tower said he still hopes to change minds among his critics before the expected 
Senate vote this week. While declining to speculate on the motives of lawmakers 
aligned against him, he said of Nunn, considered a rival force on defense 
issues: "I think he does want to be a very assertive voice in the national 
security issue. I think that's a given." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dismisses Charges 
</P>
<P>
Tower dismissed as a "phony rap" charges that his past consulting relationships 
with defense contractors were improper. The ex-senator, who made more then 
$760,000 in two years consulting defense contractors, noted that recent 
"revolving door" legislation was not designed to block the 
"cross-fertilization" between the government and defense industry. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be careful what kinds of standards you set on that," he warned, 
saying knowledge of the industry is important in the Pentagon post. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Tower declared that a chronic alcoholic "should not be 
secretary of defense, obviously" and that those with "a clear pattern of sexual 
harassment . . . shouldn't be considered for any Cabinet post . . . (or) for 
any senior position in government." 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Armed Services Committee, which recommended 11 to 9 against Tower's 
confirmation on Feb. 16, reported that it had found no evidence that Tower 
"exerted sexual pressure" on female employees or associates. But the committee 
noted "there are a number of examples of personal conduct which the committee 
found indiscreet and which call into question Sen. Tower's judgment." 
</P>
<P>
Tower said he is proud of his professional relationship with women -- one he 
said few of his colleagues could match. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that at times he was the only senator to have a woman running his 
statewide campaign or serving as his senior administrator, he said he gets 
"very high marks on providing equal opportunity for women and treating my 
female professionals with great respect." 
</P>
<P>
". . . As a matter of fact, I've if anything tended to favor women of great 
professional competence, because, competing in a man's world, they tend to work 
harder and dedicate themselves a little more intensively to what they've done," 
Tower said. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of last Sunday's dramatic pledge to forswear the consumption of 
alcohol if confirmed as secretary of defense, Tower said he has continued to 
drink wine with dinner, "although not on a daily basis." 
</P>
<P>
"I drank to excess in some instances" in the past, he said, but now has "no 
concern" that he will be able to abstain. "Delighted to do it," he said, adding 
the Pentagon heavy workload should make that easier. "I tend to get immersed in 
my work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Tower said that round-the-clock sobriety -- a standard he 
says he embraces for the secretary of defense -- "has never been exacted even 
with the President of the United States. F.D.R. (Franklin D. Roosevelt, the 
nation's 32nd President) used to sip martinis during the day when the war was 
going on." 
</P>
<P>
Tower also defended President Bush, who has steadfastly supported him since the 
nomination ran into controversy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bush 'Reiterates' Support 
</P>
<P>
He said he has told Bush's aides that he would gladly withdraw "if at any time 
this got to be an embarrassment to the President," but that Bush "reiterates to 
me on a daily basis" that he wants him to press on. 
</P>
<P>
"The President thinks in terms of what's good for the country, what's good for 
his Administration," Tower said. "I don't think that he would let old 
friendships or old loyalties . . . stand in the way of what he considers to be 
the national interest. And I believe he thinks the national interest is best 
served by pursuing this matter to a conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
If in the end the Senate rejects him, Tower said, "what you're doing then is 
damning the President's judgment." 
</P>
<P>
In a proposal made Friday, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) asked that 
Tower be given the opportunity to stand on the Senate floor and "answer his 
critics face-to-face, charge-by-charge, rumor-by-rumor and fact-by-fact." But 
even such an unprecedented act of self-defense by Tower is considered unlikely 
to turn around his grim confirmation prospects. On Friday, Sen. Dennis 
DeConcini (D-Ariz.), a key Democratic conservative, said he would oppose the 
Tower nomination, reducing to eight the number of undecided Democratic senators 
whom the Administration can lobby. 
</P>
<P>
The White House must rally all 45 Senate Republicans and win the support of at 
least five Democrats if Tower is to be approved.

THE TIMES POLL; 
</P>
<P>
AMERICANS OPPOSE TOWER, SUSPECT CONFLICT OF INTEREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Americans do not think the Senate should confirm John Tower as defense 
secretary, and they overwhelmingly reject the argument that a President should 
be allowed to fill his Cabinet with anybody he chooses, a nationwide survey by 
the Times Poll has found. 
</P>
<P>
What bothers people most about Tower -- far more than his alleged history of 
heavy drinking and womanizing -- is the suspicion that he may have a conflict 
of interest because of consulting fees he received from defense contractors 
after he left the Senate, the survey showed. 
</P>
<P>
And on the alcohol issue, nearly two-thirds of those surveyed -- 64% -- said 
they did not "trust" Tower to abide by his pledge to forsake all liquor while 
serving as defense secretary. Only 22% believed he could keep the pledge. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the public's negative opinion of Tower seems not to have rubbed off on 
President Bush. He enjoys a relatively high job rating -- 59% approval to 13% 
disapproval. 
</P>
<P>
But there are danger signs ahead for the new President as he continues his 
no-retreat, uphill fight for Tower, the poll also indicated. Many Americans -- 
28% -- still are in the process of forming an opinion about Bush, and these 
people oppose Tower's nomination 4 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
The Times poll, directed by I. A. Lewis, interviewed 1,046 adults by telephone 
Wednesday and Thursday, just as the full Senate was beginning to debate Tower's 
nomi nation in anticipation of a vote this week. The margin of error for the 
survey was 4 percentage points in either direction. 
</P>
<P>
"Ronald Reagan used to be able to go over the heads of Congress and appeal 
directly to the voters, but this poll shows that such a tactic probably won't 
work for President Bush this time because the Tower nomination doesn't have all 
that much support to begin with," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
The poll showed clearly that Bush's nomination of Tower was not a popular move 
-- just as his selection of Dan Quayle as his vice president had troubled 
people. Only a slim majority -- 52% -- said they believe the President "has 
good judgment about hiring people for government." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Potential Consequences 
</P>
<P>
The potential political consequences to Bush of trying to win Tower's 
confirmation can also be seen in another way: Although 61% of those surveyed 
said Bush's nomination of Tower had not affected their overall impression of 
the President, a significant number -- 29% -- reported that their opinions of 
him indeed had fallen. 
</P>
<P>
Tower's nomination was approved by only 18% of those interviewed. Forty-four 
percent disapproved of it and 38% were not sure. Not even Bush's core 
constituency -- Republicans and conservatives -- favored the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
But now that Tower has been nominated and is the subject of a bitter political 
fight, Republicans believe he should be confirmed, the poll showed. Democrats, 
meanwhile, are adamantly opposed to his confirmation. The overall result is 
that 44% of the public think Tower should be rejected by the Senate and just 
35% believe he should be confirmed. The rest -- 21% -- are not sure. 
</P>
<P>
Americans of all political persuasions believe overwhelmingly that "the Senate 
should take a strong stand" and exercise its constitutional right to "review 
the qualifications" of presidential nominees. By 82% to 12%, those surveyed 
rejected the thesis -- promoted by the Administration and Republican senators 
-- that "the President should be given a free hand to pick whomever he chooses 
for his Cabinet." 
</P>
<P>
A majority of people -- 52% -- thought Tower had been "treated fairly" by the 
Senate Armed Services Committee, which voted 11 to 9 along strict party lines 
to reject his nomination. Only 25% said he had been handled unfairly. Even 
conservatives considered his treatment to be equitable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Cynical 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the public is cynical about the Senate's motives, believing 
that the lawmakers mostly are "playing partisan politics" rather than "trying 
to uphold high standards of government conduct." 
</P>
<P>
Those surveyed believed that "the most serious" charge against Tower is that he 
has a conflict of interest because of the $750,000 he was paid by major defense 
contractors in the 2 1/2 years after he left the Senate. After retiring as a 
senator and chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Tower served as an arms 
control negotiator in the Reagan Administration and then became a defense 
industry consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-six percent of the people who were interviewed considered the conflict of 
interest issue to be the most serious -- twice as many as were worried about 
excessive drinking (26%) and nine times as many as were disturbed by the 
allegations of womanizing (6%). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Women Bothered by Drinking 
</P>
<P>
Women tended to be slightly more bothered by the drinking than were men, but 
not any more by the womanizing. Teetotalers also tended to regard the liquor 
accusation as more worrisome than did people who said their average daily 
alcohol consumption was at least one drink a day. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of people -- 58% -- thought that Tower's "drinking would impair 
his ability" to carry out the duties of defense secretary. Only 27% felt his 
performance would not be impaired. Again, teetotalers were the most skeptical 
about the job performance of a heavy-drinking defense secretary. 
</P>
<P>
The American public's impression of life styles within the upper echelons of 
government in Washington is that drinking is "fairly widespread," the survey 
showed. 
</P>
<P>
By region, Westerners objected the most to Tower's nomination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

PAN AM BOMBING; 
</P>
<P>
UNRAVELING THE MYSTERY OF FLIGHT 103 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LOCKERBIE, Scotland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To the ordinary eye, the tiny scrap of material recovered from the rolling 
green hills near here looked like any other piece of charred metal. 
</P>
<P>
But to bomb experts searching for clues in the downing of Pan American Flight 
103 as it flew over Scotland from London to New York last Dec. 21, the pattern 
of pitting and cratering on the metal suggested that it had been directly 
exposed to a high-intensity explosion. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators then pinned down -- they won't say exactly how, but their work 
relies heavily on computers -- that the metal came from a radio-cassette player 
that housed plastic explosives. Having determined that the cassette player had 
been carried inside a piece of luggage, they are now trying to identify the 
luggage and figure out who checked it onto Flight 103. 
</P>
<P>
If they can, they will have completed an important step in fixing 
responsibility for the deaths of the 259 people aboard the flight and 11 
citizens of this peaceful Scottish market town, whose name comes from the 
Celtic words for "a place of strength." 
</P>
<P>
It is one of the great detective operations of the decade: the inch-by-inch 
scouring of 845 square miles of the Scottish countryside by 11,000 police and 
others for more than 10,000 fragments from the doomed aircraft; then the 
sorting of the wreckage in "Shed No. 3," part of a British army ammunition 
depot 18 miles southeast of here. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Like Skeleton Dinosaur 
</P>
<P>
Inside the shed, like paleontologists putting together the skeleton of a 
dinosaur, workers wearing plastic gloves have inspected and catalogued 80% of 
the plane. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, by putting together shreds of twisted aluminum as small as 2 
inches long, they have reconstructed much of the "igloo," or portable baggage 
container, that they believe had been loaded into the forward cargo hold and 
contained the piece of luggage that carried the explosives-laden cassette 
player. 
</P>
<P>
Intelligence agencies are conducting a parallel inquiry. The prime suspects are 
no longer radical Palestinians seeking to abort the U.S. dialogue with the 
Palestine Liberation Organization, but instead pro-Iranian groups with a 
variety of possible motives, including retribution for the downing of an 
Iranian Airbus by a U.S. warship in the Persian Gulf last July. 
</P>
<P>
But the fact-gathering detectives in Scotland, fearful that preconceptions will 
color their inquiry, have not even satisfied themselves beyond a shadow of a 
doubt that the crime was a terrorist act. 
</P>
<P>
"Any investigator has his or her favorite suspect," said Neil Gallagher, chief 
of the FBI's counterterrorist unit. "It's critical that they do not allow the 
investigation to be controlled by that." 
</P>
<P>
Gallagher acknowledges that the determination that the radio-cassette player 
carried the explosive heightens the likelihood that terrorists brought down 
Flight 103. 
</P>
<P>
The bombing was apparently carried out by "motivated, highly trained" 
individuals and was not "a sporadic act," he said. "But that doesn't make it a 
terrorist act." 
</P>
<P>
Gallagher and others involved in the probe here and in Washington seem 
confident that those responsible for the act will be identified -- eventually. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day there's a new twist, a new development," Gallagher said, "which 
makes me confident a solution will be found. We're in no sense of the word 
stymied. Whether we get to court remains to be seen." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
64 Airliner Cases 
</P>
<P>
The record on solving such crimes, however, casts some doubt on Gallagher's 
optimism. Since 1968, there have been 64 cases of sabotage, bombing or 
attempted bombing of aircraft worldwide, according to Karen Gardela, a RAND 
Corp. research assistant. The vast majority have gone unresolved, she said, 
particularly when the plane was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Flight 103 seems a special case. More than two months after the plane was blown 
out of the sky, many roofs of Lockerbie houses remain covered by tarpaulins. 
Others show the telltale new tiles replacing those that had been damaged by the 
wreckage of the flight. 
</P>
<P>
Sherwood Crescent, where the main part of the fuselage smashed to the earth in 
a ball of fire, is still barricaded. Workmen have filled in most of the 
30-foot-deep gash in the ground. Somewhere underneath lies whatever remains of 
the missing bodies and four houses that were obliterated. 
</P>
<P>
What will become of the crash site remains undetermined, although some 
residents oppose any memorial that will perpetuate the place as a ghoulish 
curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
The scope of the investigation constitutes a kind of memorial to the tragedy. 
John Boyd, chief constable for the Dumfries and Galloway Region, where 
Lockerbie is located, described the probe as "an international murder inquiry 
on an unprecedented scale." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bodies on Golf Course 
</P>
<P>
During what Boyd calls Phase 1 of the investigation -- the search for bodies -- 
victims were discovered over a 10-mile radius around Lockerbie. Scores of 
bodies fell on a golf course near Mount Tilla, a hill behind the town. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain rescue teams used dogs to search for bodies in the areas of heaviest 
forestation and undergrowth. Police frogmen combed a huge reservoir a few miles 
from the town, as well as smaller streams. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the intense hunt, no trace has been found of six Americans, three 
Hungarians and one Canadian from the plane and seven Lockerbie residents. Their 
bodies, it is assumed, were virtually "vaporized," as one source close to the 
investigation put it. 
</P>
<P>
As bodies were found, eight civilian and Royal Air Force pathologists worked to 
identify them, helped by orthodontists, dental records and FBI fingerprint 
cards. In the grisly cases of two victims, Karen Lee Hunt, 21, of Rochester, 
N.Y., and Mary L. Johnson, 25, of Wayland, Mass., their bodies were 
misidentified in Lockerbie and sent to each other's family. 
</P>
<P>
Their ages and general physical description were close, and their dental charts 
were virtually identical. "I've seen them, and they had the same fillings in 
the same teeth," said one source. The mistake was discovered after the Hunt 
family became suspicious because the clothing from the body they received was 
not anything they knew to be in their daughter's wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Belongings X-Rayed 
</P>
<P>
Examination of personal belongings began with X-rays "in case of there being a 
secondary explosive device," Boyd said. After personal property is conclusively 
identified and determined to be unconnected with the bombing -- jewelry found 
with the bodies of people not suspected of any connection with the bombing, for 
instance -- it is being returned to relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Some property from the crash is considered a health risk. Police Supt. Douglas 
Roxburgh, who is in charge of the former chemical factory in Lockerbie where 
investigators are storing and examining personal effects, said the material has 
been exposed to a host of dangerous substances, including aviation fuel and 
human body fluids. 
</P>
<P>
"Area contaminated!" warn several signs at the former factory site. Inside, two 
men, wearing white gowns and caps, surgical masks over their faces and rubber 
gloves on their hands, sort through pieces of clothing. 
</P>
<P>
Next came Phase 2: examination of the wreckage. Investigators faced the massive 
task of finding and identifying fragments not only from the wide-bodied Boeing 
747 itself but also from the 21 tons of cargo -- luggage and mail -- that took 
off with the plane from London. 
</P>
<P>
At Shed No. 3, a three-acre warehouse more than 200 yards long, each piece of 
wreckage is carefully logged on a computer. Then the pieces are grouped -- 
wreckage from the cockpit goes to one corner of the shed, fragments from the 
tail section go to another, and so forth. 
</P>
<P>
From the physical evidence on the ground -- perhaps powder burns on luggage or 
luggage compartments -- investigators determined that the bomb had been carried 
in the forward baggage compartment. 
</P>
<P>
For each piece of luggage, Gallagher said, investigators sought to determine 
whether it had been on the first leg of Flight 103, a Boeing 727 from Frankfurt 
to London, and then been transferred onto the 747 in London. Or had it joined 
up with Flight 103 in London? 
</P>
<P>
Next of kin were interviewed both to draw passenger profiles and to describe 
what they knew about the luggage on Flight 103. Gallagher said agents asked for 
such details as where passengers had been before boarding the plane, why they 
were traveling, with whom they were traveling and whether they could have 
carried the bomb onto the plane, wittingly or unwittingly. 
</P>
<P>
"More than 20" of the 259 victims, mostly foreign men between the ages of 25 
and 40, still have not been cleared of suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pivotal Moment 
</P>
<P>
Investigators are now focusing on matching the radio-cassette player with the 
luggage that contained it. "This is the most pivotal part of the 
investigation," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
A conclusive answer would eliminate the time-consuming task of reassembling 
each piece of luggage. 
</P>
<P>
One source indicated Friday that investigators had narrowed the possibilities 
to a single piece of luggage. Others said only that several shreds of baggage 
that had been in direct contact with the bomb had been recovered and 
identified, but that the hunt for the specific bag was still under way. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators have indicated that, from the remains they have recovered of the 
explosive device, it was detonated by a combination timer and 
altitude-sensitive trigger. 
</P>
<P>
If the bomb was boarded onto Flight 103 in Frankfurt, then a strictly 
altitude-sensitive bomb might have been detonated in the pressure chamber that 
luggage passes through at the Frankfurt airport. And if the bomb had survived 
the pressure chamber, it might have gone off in the Boeing 727 during the 
flight to London. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Transfer Investigated 
</P>
<P>
But an altitude-sensitive bomb with a timer -- a bomb set to explode, for 
example, after two hours above 10,000 feet -- could have been loaded onto the 
727 in Frankfurt but lain dormant until Flight 103 was 31,000 feet over the 
Scottish countryside. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators have not ruled out the possibility that the bomb was transferred 
to Flight 103 in Frankfurt or London from another carrier, possibly a Middle 
East airline, that subjected its baggage to less stringent security than Pan 
Am. 
</P>
<P>
For all the meticulous legwork, investigators acknowledge that they still have 
a long way to go to answer the ultimate question. Said one: "There is still not 
a single piece of paper or evidence that says whodunnit." 
</P>
<P>
The radical Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, a 
group with close ties to Syria, has been mentioned repeatedly in speculation in 
the press over suspects. Thirteen of its members were arrested in West Germany 
in October with a Toshiba cassette player equipped with a plastic explosive 
bomb and a detonator that would go off after a period of time at high altitude. 
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. intelligence agencies have swung from early suspicion of radical 
Palestinians to Iranian factions or pro-Iranian Lebanese as the main operatives 
behind the bombing of Flight 103. Like a growing number of terrorist incidents 
in the 1980s, Bush Administration officials say, the Pan Am bombing may have 
involved operatives from multiple organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the analysis so far has been deductive rather than based on the 
evidence. The focus on radical Palestinians, such as the PFLP-General Command, 
has diminished simply because of timing. 
</P>
<P>
The PFLP was originally suspected because of an obvious motive: to sabotage the 
new U.S. dialogue with PLO chief Yasser Arafat. But Flight 103 was downed less 
than two weeks after Arafat's dramatic announcement that he had accepted U.S. 
conditions for talks. "The bombing had to already have been in the planning 
stage then," said a Bush Administration source who asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
Iran and its allies are now considered to be among the prime suspects, 
counterterrorism sources say. Not only might they have sought revenge for the 
downing of an Iran Air jetliner by the U.S. Navy last July in which 290 people 
were killed, but they also might have been trying to sabotage the efforts by 
moderate Iranian factions to create an opening to the West. 
</P>
<P>
And the mass suicide bomb has been a terrorist technique popularized by Iran 
over the last six years. 
</P>
<P>
Bush Administration sources are increasingly talking of "state sponsorship." 
But while investigators express confidence that they will uncover the identity 
of the bombers, several concede that they may not find sufficient proof to seek 
a criminal indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. David Audley of the Arizona Department of Public Safety, a past director 
of the International Assn. of Bomb Technicians and Investigators, speaks for 
experts who believe those responsible will eventually be identified. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people think that when a bomb goes off and detonates, the evidence is 
vaporized and no one will ever find the pieces," he said. "That's not true. 
It's just like someone standing on a city street and firing a gun in the air. 
Somewhere, someplace, the bullet is going down." 
</P>

BAD TIMES ON THE BAYOU;

LOUISIANA'S HOPE RUNS AS DRY AS ITS OIL-BASED ECONOMY

One day last year, the Louisiana state government came within an hour of 
missing its payroll. One day in the future, economists warn, this city could be 
knocking on bankruptcy's door. Its bonds are rated just one notch above junk 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Times are hard in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
Charity clinics overflow because the state can't afford to pay enough doctors. 
At City Hall, cracked windows go unrepaired. Children are taught in crowded 
classrooms without modern aids such as computers. One town has had to turn off 
its street lights to save money. 
</P>
<P>
"We have become a state of mediocrity instead of a state of excellence," 
Commissioner of Administration Dennis Stine said. "We've become a welfare state 
instead of a wealthy state." 
</P>
<P>
Times are hard in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 30,000 unskilled oil workers are unemployed; some have been out of 
work so long that their benefits are only a distant memory. Many skilled 
workers have fled to healthier economies. In all, almost 100,000 jobs have been 
lost since the bottom dropped out of oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Laws Curb Taxes 
</P>
<P>
Even worse, laws left over from the bygone oil boom hamper public officials' 
efforts to attract new business and raise the money needed to improve 
education, public health care and the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The French-Cajun optimism, that let-the-good-times-roll attitude that drank up 
boom after boom and thirsted through occasional busts, seems to be fading. 
People have been packing up and moving out. No hope for another oil boom, they 
say. No hope. 
</P>
<P>
"We seem to find people with short fuses lately," said Hubert Chiasson, the 
manager of New Orleans' largest unemployment office. "Do I really see any signs 
of improvement? No, I really don't." 
</P>
<P>
Times are hard in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
The state was forced to borrow $1.3 billion to cover its debt, and another $1.2 
billion to bail out its unemployment insurance fund. About 10% of the state's 
tax collections now go to pay interest on the debt. 
</P>
<P>
Sales taxes are already the highest in the nation -- the rate is 9% in New 
Orleans. Businesses fear that they will be taxed further to bail out the state. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Downward Spiral 
</P>
<P>
"It's a spiral. You can't get new business, so you can't employ all the people 
who need jobs," said Tim Ryan, director of business and economic research at 
the University of New Orleans. "That doesn't mean we will spiral down any 
further, but there will be no new growth." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, there are indicators that the economy here has bottomed out after two 
years of depression. There are no signs of improvement, however. 
</P>
<P>
The price of oil began falling in 1984. Two years later, a leading state 
business organization proclaimed that Louisiana's recession had become a 
depression. The unemployment rate reached 14.5% in January, 1987, and the 
latest figure is about 10%, or twice the national average. 
</P>
<P>
Even with its abundant resources, its waterway location and its reputation for 
good food and good times, Louisiana was ill-prepared for the day when the oil 
"gravy train" stopped, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
The taxing structure dates back to Huey Long, the populist governor who 
believed the people were entitled to a free ride at the expense of business. 
Most homes are exempt from property taxes and many state services are offered 
at unusually low rates, such as $3 a year for an automobile license plate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Revisions Voted Down 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Buddy Roemer tried to rearrange the fiscal structure, but his first 
attempt failed in the Legislature last fall. He says he will try again, and 
win, because the future of the state depends on it. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a state where big money beat big ideas, and that's a loser. We're 
trying to reverse it," Roemer said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the estimated 30,000 jobless workers, most dropped out of school to make big 
money on the oil rigs. Now, many of them don't even have the money to pack up 
and move out. 
</P>
<P>
"How are we going to get our present work force into jobs?" Eugene Schreiber, 
director of New Orleans' World Trade Center and chairman of a governor's task 
force on labor, asked. "We have to train and develop our workers." 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans has seen its sales tax revenues fall so far that the mayor said the 
only services left to cut were courts and school crossing guards. The city has 
lost $100 million -- a full third of its budget -- since oil prices crashed. 
</P>
<P>
"The current budget is in a crisis," Mayor Sidney Barthelemy said in an 
interview before opting for an $8-per-household "public safety fee," slashing 
court funds from $25 million to $15 million and announcing layoffs in the 
district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Property Tax Rule 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana law prohibits the City Council from raising property taxes without a 
general election, and by law, only 15% of the homeowners in New Orleans pay 
property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council can't raise the sales tax, by law. It can't create an income 
tax, by law. 
</P>
<P>
Barthelemy says all he can do is raise fees, such as a surcharge on water 
bills, for "public safety." 
</P>
<P>
Shreveport, in the northern part of the state, balanced its budget by laying 
off 115 Sanitation Department workers, abolishing back-door garbage pickups and 
raising water and sewer rates 25%. 
</P>
<P>
In Houma, an oil town near the Gulf of Mexico, times were so hard that 3,000 
street lights had to be turned off to save money. 
</P>
<P>
"Business has never been as bad," said Dan Catlett, owner of the Houma Pawn 
Shop. "I can't see any improvement, and I'm usually the first to tell." 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans school Supt. Everett Williams has had to cope with all the problems 
of a large, urban school system on a slashed budget. The state, the federal 
government and the city cut school funds and he has laid off 300 employees. His 
pupil-to-teacher ratio has reached 29 to 1 in elementary classes and there are 
450 pupils to each counselor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bonds Not Enough 
</P>
<P>
Voters approved a bond package for the schools, but it's not enough. This year, 
the schools are operating with $30 million in "bridge funding" from the state. 
Williams is worried that they will lose that money next year. 
</P>
<P>
He said that could mean more layoffs, a shorter school year, and a budget so 
poor that he "really couldn't operate the school district." 
</P>
<P>
Like Mayor Barthelemy, Gov. Roemer, economists and business leaders, Williams 
says the key to the future will be reshaping the tax structure to promote 
business growth and remove the handcuffs from local governments. They see good 
times ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"I am optimistic, and I guess that's how we survive," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
The governor added: "We are going to turn this state around."

TRAINS COLLIDE IN BRITAIN; 5 DIE, 80 HURT; 
</P>
<P>
CARS TUMBLE DOWN EMBANKMENT IN 2ND CRASH IN 3 MONTHS

<P>
In the second major rail accident here in less than three months, five people 
died and about 80 others were injured Saturday afternoon when two trains 
collided on the southern outskirts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said that only because the latest crash occurred on a weekend, when 
the trains were not full, the tragedy was not as deadly as the rush-hour 
collision that killed 35 commuters near London's busiest rail junction last 
Dec. 12. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors said that 20 of those hurt Saturday were in serious condition, mostly 
with multiple head, chest, and spinal injures, and that as many as 10 were 
listed as critical. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's accident, which occurred within 10 miles of the December crash, 
apparently occurred when a slower-moving northbound train switched tracks in 
front of a faster train coming up behind it near the suburban Purley station. 
</P>
<P>
The impact as the trains collided tore a gaping hole in one carriage and sent 
half a dozen others tumbling down a steep embankment. One came to rest in the 
back yards of a row of homes, stopping only a few feet short of the houses 
themselves. Residents were evacuated for fear that other derailed carriages on 
the side of the embankment could break loose and roll farther. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rescuers Used Ropes 
</P>
<P>
Local people helped pull the injured from crushed carriages, while firefighters 
had to use heavy cutting equipment to free more than a dozen others from the 
tangled wreckage. Rescue workers could only negotiate the steep embankment with 
the help of ropes. 
</P>
<P>
There was much confusion during the evening over how many people had died. At 
one point, British Broadcasting Corp. television reported 12 fatalities. But 
Scotland Yard later said that five were confirmed dead. 
</P>
<P>
"My daughter and I were deep in conversation when we heard this huge impact," a 
survivor identified as John Lawrence told reporters at Mayday Hospital in East 
Surrey. "Following that, it was mainly a case of flying debris and bodies 
flying through the carriage as well." 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence's head and jacket were caked with dried blood from cuts caused by 
flying glass. 
</P>
<P>
The exact cause of the accident was not immediately clear, although Bernard 
Munn, a local resident, told Britain's Press Assn. news service that he saw 
British Rail engineers working on signaling equipment near the site on Friday, 
apparently as part of routine monthly maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Faulty Signaling Work 
</P>
<P>
British Rail has acknowledged that December's crash near the Clapham Junction 
was caused by faulty signaling work there on the weekend prior to the accident. 
A public inquiry into the Clapham crash, which was this country's worst rail 
disaster in 20 years, is still under way. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was said by a spokesman to be "very 
distressed" by the latest accident and receiving minute-by-minute reports. Her 
junior Transport Minister, Michael Portillo, went immediately to the crash 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
A Buckingham Palace spokesman described Queen Elizabeth II as "shocked" and 
also being kept informed. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition Labor Party's shadow transportation secretary, John Prescott, 
said there had been a 20% increase in rail accidents in recent years and a 30% 
increase in casualties. "I'm extremely alarmed that safety is not getting the 
priority it needs in our railway system," he said, and he called for a full 
government statement to the House of Commons to explain Saturday's accident. 
</P>
<P>
Britain's worst rail crash occurred during World War I on May 22, 1915, when a 
troop train collided with a passenger train, killing 227.

U.S., SOVIETS AGREE TO INCREASES IN THEIR EMBASSY STAFFS

The United States and the Soviet Union have agreed to increases in their 
embassy staffs, reversing a cutback forced by the Reagan Administration after 
reporter Nicholas Daniloff was accused in Moscow of spying. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Redman, the State Department spokesman, said Friday that 18 positions 
were added last month to both the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet capital and to the 
Soviet Embassy here, along with two additional slots at the U.S. and Soviet 
consulates in Leningrad and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 1, Redman said, 13 additional slots will be added to each of the 
embassies and two more to the consulates. The maximums then would be 256 for 
the embassies and 30 for the consulates. 
</P>
<P>
Daniloff's arrest -- he was subsequently released -- touched off a diplomatic 
tiff in which the Reagan Administration in October, 1986, imposed ceilings of 
225 at the embassies and 26 at the consulates. 
</P>
<P>
This forced the Soviets, which had a bigger staff, to withdraw about 80 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining the reversal, Redman said the workload at the U.S. Embassy and 
consulate had increased.

SALVADOR REBELS URGE 'LAST CHANCE' TALKS

<TEXT>
<P>
El Salvador's rebels Saturday proposed "a last opportunity" meeting with the 
government Tuesday and Wednesday to negotiate a peace settlement and called on 
the United States to end its opposition to postponing a presidential election 
to Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that the government had never responded to a previous guerrilla offer to 
meet this weekend, Radio Venceremos, the clandestine radio of the Farabundo 
Marti National Liberation Front, said that "finding ourselves at the end of 
opportune time we propose negotiations no later than March 7 and 8 in El 
Salvador." 
</P>
<P>
If the talks aren't held and the voting is not delayed, said Salvador Samayoa, 
a senior FMLN spokesman in a separate interview, "there is no possibility of a 
negotiated solution for five years" -- the period until the next presidential 
election. 
</P>
<P>
President Jose Napoleon Duarte last Sunday had accepted the idea of a meeting 
with the FMLN, as the guerrillas are commonly called, for last Tuesday, in 
Guatemala, a plan rejected by the rebels, who said that the talks should be 
held here. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Limited Subject 
</P>
<P>
Even if a meeting is held, the guerrillas' demand that the subject be limited 
to the postponement of the voting from March 19 to Sept. 15 is not acceptable 
to Duarte, the Salvadoran armed forces and the Nationalist Republican Alliance, 
the far-rightist party that is the likely winner of the presidential voting and 
has unswervingly opposed any delay in the elections. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte, who cannot succeed himself and whose Christian Democratic Party is 
trailing badly in opinion polls, has said the election could be set back to 
April 30, but neither Arena, as the right-wing party is called, nor the FMLN 
accepted that proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The latest guerrilla initiative is in line with a continuing effort to avoid 
being labeled as the party that wrecked an opportunity to end the fighting that 
has claimed at least 45,000 lives in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
A European diplomat said that a senior rebel leader had told him that the 
rebels were engaging in a "stunt" from the beginning. And, in fact, the FMLN's 
motives have been viewed with cynicism since they opened the current "peace 
process" Jan. 23 with a proposal to participate in and accept the outcome of 
the election, if the balloting was put off until Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the FMLN has refused to let the initiative die with the 
government's having the last word. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said that contacts have already been made between Arena and the 
FMLN to hold talks after the election and that Arena has considered offering 
government positions to political allies of the rebels, either to improve the 
atmosphere or divide the left. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's rebel proposal for another meeting date was made against the 
backdrop of ambiguous statements by rebel spokesman Samayoa in Mexico City, who 
said that he had given up all but the slightest hope for a postponement. 
</P>
<P>
He said that even if the voting goes ahead March 19 as now scheduled, the 
rebels will not violently disrupt it unless there are "very exceptional 
conditions." Such "conditions" presumably would include a government effort to 
impede the campaign of the Democratic Convergence, a coalition of leftist 
parties allied with the FMLN that is running in the election. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Radio Venceremos urged its listeners to boycott the voting 
or cast invalid ballots because "the election of March 19 will only aggravate 
hunger and misery, as it holds out no hope of a real solution." 
</P>
<P>
Samayoa accused the United States of manipulating President Duarte and the 
Arena party to try to make the FMLN appear to be the villain despite what he 
said were determined FMLN efforts to be conciliatory. "We have reduced to 
almost zero the rhetoric and public confrontation with the United States," he 
said. "We understood this as a clear signal that we were looking for an 
understanding." 
</P>

That was an apparent reference to the distribution of key rebel proposals to 
officials and politicians in Washington for comment before they were publicly 
disclosed.

"The United States was worried because the FMLN had too much political 
initiative in El Salvador and internationally," Samayoa said. "They are trying 
to neutralize this support and political initiative."

He rejected the notion that talks could be restarted after the election. "What 
would talks continue for? So that we accept the government and hand over our 
arms? That is not going to happen."

However, he acknowledged that during the Feb. 21 discussions in Mexico, "Arena 
began talking about dialogue" after the election.

An incorrect order nearly caused a major accident aboard a Soviet 
nuclear-powered icebreaker, but safety mechanisms and crew action averted a 
disaster, a senior official said in an interview published Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Rostislav Nikolsky told the Merchant Marine Ministry daily Vodni Transport that 
an order to open a drain valve to a working reactor aboard the icebreaker 
Rossiya had triggered a four-minute emergency while the vessel was undergoing 
maintenance last November in the Arctic port of Murmansk. 
</P>
<P>
"If there had been further crew errors, the reactor would have been left with 
no cooling system and the fuel could have melted," said Nikolsky, head of the 
state committee on safety in the nuclear industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The first safety barrier could have been broken and radioactivity would have 
spread through the entire installation. . . . But the triggering of the 
accident mechanism and steps taken by the crew stabilized the situation."

KABUL, Afghanistan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A convoy of several hundred trucks carrying food and fuel from the Soviet Union 
reached the Afghan capital virtually unscathed Saturday following a deal 
reportedly struck between rebels and President Najibullah. 
</P>
<P>
Afghan officials said up to 600 trucks arrived in Kabul from the Soviet border 
town of Termez, and 300 more are expected today. 
</P>
<P>
Drivers reported foul weather along the route down the Salang Highway from the 
Soviet border to Kabul through territory held by Muslim rebels, but only a 
single attack, apparently launched by a rival group not a party to the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"There was only one moujahedeen attack," said Abdul Fatah, a convoy organizer. 
He said three rockets were fired from mountains north of Kabul. One set fire to 
a fuel tanker, but the driver survived. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Allowed Safe Passage 
</P>
<P>
An Afghan official said Najibullah and his Marxist People's Democratic Party of 
Afghanistan government struck a deal with a rebel commander controlling Kabul 
province and the Salang area to allow the convoy to pass safely. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to name him, but a diplomat said it probably was Ahmed Shah Masoud, 
the most successful moujahedeen field commander in the nine-year fight against 
Afghan troops and the now-departed Soviet forces. 
</P>
<P>
Masoud is reported to have extended his reach northward to Kunduz province near 
the Soviet border. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes there was a deal," said Fatah. "Masoud does not stop food and fuel for 
Kabul now. The rockets were fired by Gulbuddin's men," he added, referring to 
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a hard-line Afghan rebel leader opposed to any compromise 
with Najibullah. 
</P>
<P>
The deal would account for both the arrival of the convoy, which had been 
delayed for nearly a week, and the absence of rebel shelling or rocket attacks 
on Kabul in the past 12 days. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Food and Land 
</P>
<P>
The official said the quid pro quo for the rebel commander would be food, land, 
fertilizers, an assurance that he would be allowed to retain de facto control 
over his areas of influence and even the right to buy arms. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said that the week's delay in the arrival of the trucks, eagerly 
awaited in a city short of flour, meat and fuel, was caused by snow, not rebel 
attacks, and that the government forces still control all four of the main 
roads leading to the city. 
</P>
<P>
A deal with Masoud could bolster Najibullah and his party against the rival 
government elected by rebel political leaders at a council meeting, or shura, 
in Pakistan last month. 
</P>
<P>
It would also lend credence to reports of a rift between rebel political 
leaders and the moujahedeen fighters who waged the war against Soviet and 
Afghan troops. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hard Winter 
</P>
<P>
The past winter has been the worst in years in Afghanistan, and snow still lies 
thick on the hills surrounding Kabul. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of shortages, most foods are still widely available in Kabul at a 
price. The poor are the worst affected, but there appears to be no threat of 
starvation. 
</P>
<P>
Fruit, vegetables, cooking oil and other necessities are on display in the 
shops and bazaars and those lining up for bread are mainly poor people unable 
to afford decontrolled prices. 
</P>
<P>
Some officials said a voucher system for bread, gasoline, sugar and some other 
staples would be announced this week. It was not clear whether the convoy's 
arrival would alter this. 
</P>
<P>
The most visible effect of the shortages is the lack of traffic on the roads 
because of the scarcity of gasoline.

<P>
New snowfall up to 18 inches deep left travelers stranded Saturday in much of 
the upper Midwest, and nurses had to summon four-wheel-drive taxis to get to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Snowplows were taken off some roads where blowing snow reduced visibility to 
zero. On other highways, the snow drifted back as soon as the plows passed. 
</P>
<P>
Along the edge of the snowstorm, thick fog made travel risky in southeastern 
Wisconsin and delayed some morning flights in and out of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Southwestern Minnesota was hit hardest by the snow, with 18 inches at 
Worthington. 
</P>
<P>
Northern and central Wisconsin also got heavy snow. 
</P>
<P>
In eastern Louisiana, a tornado damaged several buildings and uprooted trees 
that blocked roads in Tensas Parish, but no injuries were reported, authorities 
said.

MANY STRANDED BY CANCELLATIONS AT LAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

As a nationwide Eastern Airlines strike forced the carrier to cancel all of its 
flights out of Los Angeles International Airport on Saturday, frustrated 
travelers found themselves arguing with ticket agents, sprinting between 
terminals in search of alternative flights and, in some cases, making 
preparations to spend an extra, unplanned evening in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the airline's early-morning assurances that their flights would not be 
canceled, many would-be Eastern passengers found themselves confronted with two 
monitors showing a white line drawn through the 15 flights scheduled to depart 
for everywhere from Atlanta to Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
And, starting Monday, hundreds of Southern Californians who commute to Los 
Angeles by train from San Diego, Santa Barbara and elsewhere may find 
themselves in a similar situation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Amtrak May Be Struck 
</P>
<P>
A secondary strike by railway workers may affect cities along the Eastern 
Seaboard as well as Amtrak commuter trains in Southern California, according to 
officials of the International Assn. of Machinists. Officials estimate that 
2,200 Southern Californians board Amtrak trains each day for trips to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We fully expect to have secondary pickets up on our property," Amtrak 
spokesman John Jacobsen said Saturday. "At Amtrak, we are taking nothing for 
granted. Maybe the whole system gets shut down. We won't know until 5 to 6 a.m. 
Monday." 
</P>
<P>
A secondary strike is one in which union members in an unrelated company walk 
out in sympathy with a union engaged in a dispute. Although the practice has 
been outlawed for most of the economy since 1947, exceptions are allowed in the 
case of transportation companies. 
</P>
<P>
At the airport, Christina Varas, standing near the Eastern Airlines ticket 
counter, shook her head as she prepared to drive her mother and father back to 
Encino. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plans Were Confirmed 
</P>
<P>
"We learned two days ago that they were going to strike, so we started calling, 
but even last night they said they weren't going to cancel the international 
flights," said Varas, whose parents were scheduled to take a canceled 1:30 p.m. 
flight home to Buenos Aires. "We had frequent flyer tickets and no other 
airline will honor them. (And besides,) all the other companies are booked." 
</P>
<P>
Activity at the Eastern terminal at LAX ranged from picketing to pacing. More 
than 200 union workers marched with placards outside the building while dozens 
of disgruntled travelers ran back and forth between the ticket counters. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know what a yo-yo is?" asked an angry Las Burger, who for more than an 
hour had been trying to get himself, his wife and two friends on a flight to 
Miami. "That's what we are, between (the ticket counters of) Continental and 
Eastern. . . . Nobody wants to accept any responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
It was a sentiment echoed by many who had trouble getting other airlines to 
honor their tickets, although Eastern agents had made promises to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extra Ticket Expense 
</P>
<P>
"They (Eastern representatives) called me the night before and said they'd put 
me on Pan Am," said Michelle Judd, 21. She had bought a $500, round-trip 
Eastern ticket from Miami to Los Angeles, only to find on arriving at the Pan 
Am counter in Miami that she had to buy another ticket. "That was another 
$250," said the college student. 
</P>
<P>
And Judd said she will probably spend a further $250 for a ticket on another 
airline before the week is through, since she has no intention of flying back 
on Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never fly Eastern again, even if it's the last airline available," she 
said. "They knew how many people this (strike) would affect and I don't see how 
they could let this happen." 
</P>
<P>
But anger and disappointment were not the only emotions vented by the delayed 
passengers. Many also expressed sympathy, for the workers outside on the picket 
line and for the ticket agents behind the counters.

"Human folly" in pursuing President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's anti-drinking drive 
caused the destruction of 16% of Soviet vineyards, many of which were not 
intended to produce wine, the media said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The labor daily Trud said table grapes rather than wine grapes suffered the 
most during the systematic uprooting of vines spurred by the interest in 
promoting Soviet sobriety. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985-87, 533,000 acres of Soviet vineyards, or 16% of the total, were 
destroyed, Trud said. The official Tass news agency called it a "human folly." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev launched the anti-alcohol campaign in May, 1985, raising the price of 
vodka and other alcoholic beverages and cutting production within two months of 
being named Communist Party chief. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Soviets have admitted they erred in treating all alcoholic 
beverages alike, and have liberalized the sales of wine, cognac and some other 
beverages.

PRESSURE ON INDEPENDENT FILM COMPANIES SEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CIEPLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The merger agreement between Time Inc. and Warner Communications has some film 
executives wondering whether a combination of the two entertainment giants 
would put new pressure on struggling independent film companies. Of particular 
concern is the prospect of joint ownership of the Warner Bros. studio and the 
Time-owned HBO cable network, which has been a major source of revenue for 
movie producers. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that HBO is part of Warner Bros., does it become part of an overall 
conspiracy to kill off the independents?" asked a veteran movie producer who 
requested he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Small Competitors 
</P>
<P>
That producer specifically wondered whether HBO, if it were associated with a 
major studio, would continue to cultivate smaller competitors such as Kings 
Road Entertainment by entering deals to fund slates of pictures, as it has done 
in the past. Other Hollywood insiders wondered if Warner would receive more 
favorable treatment than other studios from HBO. "It's hard to imagine HBO's 
deals with Warner really being at arm's length," said one talent agent. 
</P>
<P>
However, even entertainment executives who expressed concern over the merger 
suggested that huge entertainment conglomerates such as a Time-Warner 
combination would still need the help of independent film makers. 
</P>
<P>
"In the short term, as these corporations get larger and larger, you wonder if 
there's going to be any room at all for independent product. But, longer term, 
they'll have to depend on the independents to fuel these big machines they're 
building," said Ira Deutschman, a former marketing executive with Cinecom 
International and a board member of the Independent Features Project West, an 
association that promotes the interests of smaller film makers. 
</P>
<P>
Deutschman and others have argued that big companies, particularly in the 
entertainment industry, often lose their creative punch as they grow. 
</P>
<P>
"Warner's not suddenly going to make 60 movies a year just because they have 
more money, and I'm sure HBO is going to keep making deals just the way they 
always did," said Alan Ladd Jr., chairman of newly formed Pathe Entertainment 
Inc., which is co-owned by Italian entrepreneur Giancarlo Parretti. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More of the Same 
</P>
<P>
Some industry leaders noted that the merger merely accentuates a consolidation 
that has been under way among media and entertainment companies for several 
years. But they did not predict that it would force other major studios to seek 
merger partners. 
</P>
<P>
"Is this going to put pressure on us to grow? No. Larger is sometimes better 
and sometimes not," Walt Disney Co. Chairman and chief executive officer 
Michael Eisner said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he saw a potential competitive problem in Warner's new 
association with HBO, however, Eisner indicated some concern. 
</P>
<P>
"(Warner Bros. chairman) Bob Daly has been the most articulate statesman we've 
had in the movie business. I hope this (merger) doesn't mute his ability to 
keep an open marketplace for our products," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Disney had $3.44 billion in revenues last year, and has interests in movie and 
TV production, broadcasting, theme parks, cable television and recorded music. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Big Players 
</P>
<P>
Other large entertainment conglomerates include MCA Inc., which owns Universal 
Pictures; Gulf &amp; Western Inc., which owns Paramount Pictures; Coca-Cola 
Inc., which holds a major stake in Columbia Pictures Entertainment, and News 
Corp. Ltd., which owns Fox Inc. 
</P>
<P>
One top film executive said the prospective price of Orion Pictures and MGM/UA 
Communications, studios not currently owned by entertainment conglomerates, is 
likely to increase because of the Time-Warner merger. "These companies are 
going to be worth a lot more money now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The merger appears to highlight one advantage cable networks have over big 
broadcasting networks such as ABC, NBC and CBS. Under government regulations, 
some of which are set to expire in 1991, broadcast networks are prohibited from 
producing and owning their own programs -- a restriction that does not apply to 
cable networks such as HBO or Viacom International Inc.'s Showtime and the 
Movie Channel services. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Madsen, a spokeswoman for Capital Cities/ABC Inc., declined to say 
whether her company saw any implications in the merger for the major television 
networks.

LAURIE SHIELDS; FORMED WOMEN'S LEAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Laurie Shields, one of two California women who organized the national Older 
Women's League in 1981, died Friday. 
</P>
<P>
She was 68 and died at her home in Oakland of breast cancer, said league 
spokeswoman Mary Gardner Jones in a statement issued in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"Laurie Shields was an indomitable woman who was fired by concern for displaced 
homemakers and older women -- women confronted by widowhood, divorce and sex 
and age discrimination," said Lou Glasse, president of the Older Women's 
League. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Team Effort 
</P>
<P>
"Women all across the country have lost a powerful force," Glasse said. "She 
will be missed." 
</P>
<P>
With Tish Sommers, who died in 1985, Ms. Shields started a grass-roots movement 
for older women's rights which now is a Washington-based organization with 
17,000 members and 120 chapters nationwide. Earlier, in 1975, they had founded 
the Alliance for Displaced Homemakers Among the league's many targets are 
inequities facing older women in the job market, in pension plans, Social 
Security and insurance benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Using the slogan "Don't Agonize -- Organize," the two women helped inspire 
federal legislation that set up job training and counseling centers for what 
they called "displaced homemakers" -- housewives whose lives changed 
drastically in middle-age because of a divorce or death of a husband. 
</P>
<P>
Ms. Shields had painful personal knowledge of the problems of older women. 
After her husband died in 1970, "she found herself unable to get a job because 
of age discrimination," the league said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Book Published 
</P>
<P>
Ms. Shields and Ms. Sommers wrote a book called, "Women Take Care," about the 
experience of care givers. It was published after Ms. Sommers' death. 
</P>
<P>
During a national book tour, Ms. Shields said that the care-giving movement 
should support those who choose not to be care givers as well as those who do. 
</P>
<P>
"Although I chose to be a care giver twice . . . it's not a role that is 
everyone's cup of tea," she said. "We must work together to prevent society 
from force-feeding it to the women simply because it is perceived to be a 
woman's role." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Chicago, Ms. Shields worked in merchandise and advertising before 
marrying. She is survived by a daughter.

E.W. LYON, 84; EX-PRESIDENT OF POMONA COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROXANE ARNOLD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Elijah Wilson Lyon, the Mississippi-born historian who guided Pomona College 
from the upheavals of World War II through the student protests of the 1960s 
before retiring in 1969 to become its president emeritus, died Saturday in a 
Pomona hospital after a long illness. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
A Rhodes scholar and recipient of countless honorary degrees and other awards, 
Lyon was credited with developing Pomona College, one of five undergraduate 
schools belonging to the Claremont Colleges, into a leading liberal arts 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
From the time he was named president of Pomona College in 1941 until his 
retirement in 1969, he saw the school's endowment rise from $3.5 million to 
more than $22 million and the student body swell from 790 to 1,200. Nine 
dormitories and academic buildings were added to the campus, including the 
highly regarded Seaver Science Complex and the Oldenborg Center, a residential 
hall for students studying foreign languages and international relations. 
</P>
<P>
Known as a scholar's scholar, the patrician-looking Lyon also took it upon 
himself to recruit an entire generation of faculty members, setting the tone 
for what is taught in classrooms there today. 
</P>
<P>
"He felt his paramount duty was the appointment of a strong faculty," said 
David Alexander, president of the college. "For 28 years, Wilson Lyon applied 
his view of liberal education to the development of Pomona College and what the 
college is today is the product of those dreams." 
</P>
<P>
Born in the Heidelberg, Miss., in 1904, Lyon at first planned to be a 
journalist. But the love of history soon took over. Lyon went to the University 
of Mississippi, where his outstanding record and his tenure as senior class 
president and editor of the college newspaper, helped him win a Rhodes 
Scholarship to St. John's College at Oxford. 
</P>
<P>
After returning to the United States, he began his career in the world of 
academics, first as an assistant professor of history at Louisiana Polytechnic 
Institute and then at Colgate University, where he was named head of the 
history department in 1934. 
</P>
<P>
Almost as soon as he arrived at Pomona, he found himself in turbulent times, 
first because of the outset of World War II and then into the McCarthy era. 
Throughout it all, he is said to have stood tall in defending academic freedom. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1966 tribute to Lyon, a Pomona professor said that "only years after an 
incident is a Pomona teacher likely to learn, and then indirectly, that the 
president stood unbendingly as a silent buffer, absorbing emotion-heated 
criticism that might, if thrust bullishly into the classroom, have ruptured a 
delicate emotional membrane." 
</P>
<P>
After retiring, Lyon returned once again to history, writing more history books 
and speaking at major colleges throughout the country. To honor him, a 
professorship was established in his name in 1969; and then in 1989, 
ground-breaking was held on campus for the college's newest dormitory -- the E. 
Wilson Lyon Court. 
</P>
<P>
Lyon is survived by his wife, Carolyn; a daughter, Elizabeth Lyon Webb of New 
York; a son, John Wilson Lyon of Washington; a sister and four grandchildren. 
Memorial services will be held on campus March 10.

MOTHER LODE COUNTY'S CEMETERIES YIELD TREASURE TROVE OF AREA LORE

<P>
Four generations of Hart Ralph Tambs' family are buried in the Sonora 
Historical Cemetery. That is where he found the grave of his great-uncle Fred 
O. Ralph, who died in 1873, a relative he had not realized was buried there. He 
also found the grave marker of a first cousin who died when he was 25 days old. 
</P>
<P>
But when he looked a week later, the marker had been stolen. Tambs, 67, 
discovered that such incidents are commonplace and result in many people being 
unable to locate their ancestors' graves. 
</P>
<P>
"There were markers for everyone at one time," he said. "Those missing were 
stolen or destroyed by vandals." 
</P>
<P>
Tambs decided to do a plot map of the Sonora cemetery. He also has mapped six 
other cemeteries in the area and has plans to do 23 more. It is his gift to the 
people in this Mother Lode community in the Sierra Nevada foothills. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unscrambling a Puzzle 
</P>
<P>
And on a personal level, it is a puzzle he never tires of trying to unscramble. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at this faded headstone," Tambs said as he began reading it to a visitor. 
" 'Erected by S. G. to the memory of Nelly, Jan. 14, 1861.' I'm going to do 
some research and find out who S. G. and Nelly were. I'll bet there's a good 
story there." 
</P>
<P>
Tambs is just completing his survey of the Sonora Historical Cemetery. 
Townspeople call it "the old cemetery on the hill." 
</P>
<P>
All the cemetery maps and records had been lost, so Tambs had to copy the 
inscriptions from all 1,060 markers. Poring through county records, he found 
information about 619 other people buried there whose graves are now unmarked. 
From all this information, he pieced together a plot map. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, all the cemetery plot maps in the county have disappeared over 
the years," Tambs said. "People go to the cemeteries and look for graves of 
loved ones or ancestors who died years ago and can't find them. This will 
help." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Retirement Project 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, Tambs is doing plot maps for 30 known cemeteries in Tuolumne 
County. It is a voluntary effort, his retirement project. (He retired in 1975 
from his job as an engineer for Pacific Telephone Co.) 
</P>
<P>
One thing he has not figured out is what motivates graveyard vandals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to understand why anyone would desecrate a grave, but it 
happens all the time. An average of six grave markers a week have been 
vandalized or stolen while I have been doing the survey in this cemetery," he 
said. Some steal headstones and put them in their back yards. Can you imagine 
that?" 
</P>
<P>
He encountered a heavy concrete marker that had been knocked off its concrete 
base and broken in two. "It took more than one person to knock that one over," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Damaged Headstone 
</P>
<P>
The inscription on the damaged headstone read: 
</P>
<P>
"Magie Mersereau. Died March 30, 1884. Aged 24 years &amp; 26 days. Goodby 
Babies dear. As I can no longer be here. To Heaven have Gone. Will meet you 
there." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heart-Shaped Stone 
</P>
<P>
Nearby was a tombstone, flat on the ground, in the shape of a heart with the 
inscription: "Susan Hester Curnow. Died March 21, 1910." Tambs pointed out the 
oldest tombstone in the graveyard, that of Louise Lepaper, who was born in 
Paris in 1824 and died in Jamestown in 1856. 
</P>
<P>
To get information from old, weathered wooden markers, Tambs waits until the 
sun is just right, with the light coming in at a 45-degree angle. To help him 
read the faded inscriptions he uses powder, chalk and magnifying glasses. 
</P>
<P>
One tombstone was for William K. Rushing (1835-1880), a rancher. A nearby 
mountain is named in his honor. At the headstone for Happy Hen Chow Ng 
(1856-1948) Tambs remarked: "He was the last resident of Sonora's Chinatown. I 
knew him when I was a boy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Much to Be Learned' 
</P>
<P>
"There's so much to be learned in the cemetery. The history of the whole area 
is here." 
</P>
<P>
Tambs has prepared plot maps of the old cemeteries in Columbia, the 
19th-Century Gold Rush town now a state historic park. Sharon Grout, a ranger 
at the park the last 11 years who oversees the cemeteries, lamented the 
vandalism, especially by Satanists. 
</P>
<P>
"Devil worshipers scrawl anti-religious pentagrams on the tombstones. They 
knock over grave markers and destroy them. We have caught groups in the 
cemetery at night when there is no reason for anyone to be there," Grout said.

POMONA HAS FINAL SAY IN CCAA TOURNAMENT WITH WIN OVER CSUN

There was something noticeably different about Cal Poly Pomona center Niki 
Bracken, and it had little to do with the sore right ankle she has been nursing 
for the past three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Northridge Coach Leslie Milke recognized Bracken's disposition as 
soon as the Lady Matadors took the floor to play Pomona in the final of the 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. women's basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"She was in a different gear than she was the last time we played them," Milke 
said of Bracken. "There was something in the look in her eye tonight that said 
she wasn't going to be stopped." 
</P>
<P>
Bracken scored 30 points and had eight rebounds as the Lady Broncos, ranked 
third in Division II, defeated 14th-ranked Northridge, 75-62, Saturday night at 
Riverside City College. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona has won every CCAA title since the conference was established in the 
1981-82 season. It was the third time in the four-year history of the CCAA 
postseason tournament that Pomona defeated Northridge in the final. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Broncos (24-5 overall) will begin their quest for a fourth national 
title when they play host to the West regional -- which could also include 
Northridge (21-8) -- Friday and Saturday. The Division II field will be 
selected today. 
</P>
<P>
"When I get in my mind that I'm the best, that's when I really play," said 
Bracken, who had 17 points and 10 rebounds in a semifinal victory over Cal 
State Los Angeles on Thursday and was named the tournament's most valuable 
player for the second consecutive season. "When it comes down to the last 
couple of games and we're going for the championship, I just feel no one can 
stop me." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge was attempting to duplicate the performance that earned the Lady 
Matadors a 67-61 victory over Pomona on Feb. 23, ending the Lady Broncos' 
26-game CCAA win streak and the Lady Matadors' 29-game losing streak to Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
But in that game Bracken, still hampered by the effects of an ankle injury she 
sustained Feb. 9 against Chapman, scored just 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, the 6-foot-2 junior from Compton High scored 16 points in the first 
half, making eight of 10 field-goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd let her get the ball and turn around," said Northridge guard Bridgette 
Ealy, who had 15 points and 11 rebounds. "You can't let her get the ball 
because every time she gets it, she will score. I mean, she's automatic." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge's Chris Cavalin, who scored a team-high 18 points, pulled the Lady 
Matadors to within 15-11 with 12:39 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Bracken, however, scored eight points during a 16-4, six-minute run that staked 
the Lady Broncos to a 31-15 lead. Northridge trimmed the deficit to 38-29 by 
halftime, but the Lady Matadors never got closer than nine points. 
</P>
<P>
"We played tired tonight," said Milke, whose team defeated Chapman, 89-73, 
Thursday. "I don't know whether it was a physical or mental tiredness or a 
combination of the two." 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Gooden, Pomona's senior All-American guard, had 15 points, including 
three three-point baskets, and five assists. Forward Stephanie Coons added 12 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Led by Bracken, who made 14 of 22 field-goal attempts, Pomona outshot 
Northridge, 54% to 39%, and outrebounded the Lady Matadors, 38-33.

MORNINGSIDE WINS 5-AA CROWN AGAIN

<P>
After they had beaten Fontana, 71-48, to win their second consecutive Southern 
Section championship, the Lady Monarchs of Morningside High gathered in a 
circle in Kellogg Gymnsium and joined together in an abbreviated team embrace. 
</P>
<P>
The coaches and players then broke away and strode off to meet with family and 
friends who had made the long trek to Cal Poly Pomona and now wanted to offer 
their congratulations. 
</P>
<P>
From all indications, this was a rather subdued celebration from a squad that 
has just won the Southern Section 5-AA championship in workman-like fashion 
and, in the process, dispatched a team that had been beaten just once in 
1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs, ranked No. 3 in the nation in a USA Today poll and top-seeded in 
the CIF 5-AA tournament, appear to have become accustomed to winning. They are 
now 29-1, having lost only to Louisville (Ky.) South, ranked No. 2 nationally. 
</P>
<P>
So winning games and championships is just the norm, and there's no reason for 
the Monarchs to get up in arms over a simple victory. Or is that the real 
reason? 
</P>
<P>
"We're not celebrating too hard right now because we know we have to prepare 
for the next round of games," said freshman forward Janet Davis, who scored 15 
points, including nine in the pivotal third quarter, and pulled down 10 
rebounds. "We can celebrate and have fun, but we know what's ahead of us, too." 
</P>
<P>
What's next for the Lady Monarchs is the Division I state tournament, which 
starts off regional play next week. Pairings will be drawn sometime today at 
the Southern Section offices. 
</P>
<P>
All too fresh in Morningside's memory is last year's state championship game. 
After winning the Southern Section 4A title, the Monarchs were unceremoniously 
dumped by Fremont, 52-50. A return trip and a chance for redemption has 
motivated Morningside the entire 1988-89 season. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night at Cal Poly Pomona, the Monarchs looked ready for the next round 
of games from the outset when they scored the first 10 points and never looked 
back. 
</P>
<P>
Guard JoJo Witherspoon started the scoring with an easy lay-up, and Tyesha 
Whiting followed with a pair of free throws. Junior center Lisa Leslie then 
scored six points in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Fontana (27-2) finally got on the board with 5:10 remaining in the first period 
when center Danielle Carter fooled Leslie with a nifty fake and scored an easy 
three-footer. Carter, who had all nine of Fontana's points in the first period, 
helped the Lady Steelers close to within 14-9 with two minutes left in the 
quarter, but that was the closest Fontana would get. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew that no matter how many points Danielle Carter got inside, it wouldn't 
be enough if it was just her," said Leslie, who scored 24 points, grabbed 16 
rebounds, blocked five shots and had four steals. "By the second quarter we had 
pretty much figured out their defense." 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs closed strong in the first quarter but received a scare when 
Witherspoon took a nasty fall with 20 seconds remaining. She left the game but 
reported back with more than seven minutes left in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Sparked by the return of their play-making guard, the Monarchs went on a 16-2 
run over the next five minutes to take a 30-11 advantage. Morningside led, 
40-18, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a country girl," said Witherspoon, who is originally from Arkansas. "I've 
got a lot of heart." 
</P>
<P>
By this time, Morningside had forced Fontana to change its offense by denying 
Carter the ball inside and daring Fontana to take the outside shot. 
</P>
<P>
And that was the Lady Steelers' undoing. Guard Tina Felt was 3 for 26 from the 
field, forward Jolanda Jackson was 2 for 8 and Kimberly Barnes was 0 for 4. The 
entire Fontana team shot only .255 (14 for 55) in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We were getting the outside shot, but we couldn't hit anything," lamented 
Fontana Coach Jack Willis, whose team may still receive an at-large bid in the 
state championship round. "But, really, credit them. They're an excellent club, 
and they're the reason we didn't hit anything." 
</P>
<P>
The game was essentially over by halftime, but Witherspoon and Davis started 
the third period as though it were still close. Leslie scored from inside, 
Davis converted a free throw for a three-point play, Witherspoon scored, then 
Davis hit three baskets in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Witherspoon capped off the third period with three baskets in the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference tonight," Morningside Coach Frank Scott said, "was JoJo 
Witherspoon and Lisa Leslie. They are two great competitors. Witherspoon just 
controlled the floor and took whatever they gave her, and Lisa did a great job 
on their big girl (Carter)." 
</P>
<P>
Witherspoon finished with 20 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists, while 
forward Akiba Flanagan had four points and eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Carter led Fontana with 19 points and 16 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Palos Verdes boys' soccer team wasn't taking any chances Friday afternoon 
in the Southern Section 4-A championship game against Edison at Gahr High. 
</P>
<P>
With an opportunity to bring back to Palos Verdes the first CIF soccer 
championship in the school's history, the Sea Kings started quickly, scoring 
two goals in the game's first 18 minutes, and breezed to a 2-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes, which held the top spot in the 4-A rankings the entire 1988-89 
season, finishes with a 33-0 record. Sunset League representative Edison is 
13-6-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings got on the board 13 minutes into the game when Brandon DeMott, in 
good position after Lance Haworth's shot was blocked by goalie Taylor Marcus, 
scored on the rebound. 
</P>
<P>
Five minutes later, Jeff Bowers took a pass from Al Lindsay and scored on a 
header. 
</P>
<P>
With the victory, Palos Verdes set several Southland records, including best 
single-season record. The previous record was set by South Torrance, which went 
28-0-1 in 1974.

WARRIORS BEAT RIVERSIDE, GO TO STATE FINALS 
</P>

<P>
Few expected El Camino to reach the junior college basketball state finals 
after Paul Landreaux left to become an assistant at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
But first-year Coach Ron McClurkin said from the start of this season that his 
team would reach the finals, and Saturday night his promise was fulfilled: The 
Warriors earned the trip to Santa Clara for the March 9 state tournament with 
an 81-65 win over No. 6-seeded Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
McClurkin has also said all season that if his team limits its opponents to 60 
points a game, it should have no problem winning. 
</P>
<P>
That almost came true as well Saturday for the No. 3-seeded Warrriors (23-8) in 
their Southern California Regional bracket final at El Camino. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it took more than El Camino's usual strong defense to win this one. The 
Warriors were aided greatly by their top gun, sophomore guard Kevin Mixon, who 
had a game-high 39 points, including 9 for 9 from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a big game," Mixon said, "and I knew I had to come through. I knew I 
had to take my shots, and I did." 
</P>
<P>
Riverside (27-9) was up 35-34 three minutes into the second half, but the 
Warriors went on a 12-point run that included three Mixon three-pointers. That 
put El Camino up 46-35 with 12:48 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers rallied and trailed by only five, 58-53, with 4:25 left on the 
clock, but El Camino answered once again with three consecutive Mixon 
three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to Santa Clara," a smiling McClurkin said after the game. "I think 
we played the same game we played against Glendale, except that we shot the 
ball. Oh, and we got it in." 
</P>
<P>
El Camino, which has had few good first-half performances this season, came out 
roaring against Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors hustled from the start and hit the boards hard. The led for most 
of the half -- unlike Wednesday's game against Glendale, when they had gone 
through an early shooting slump. The only time Riverside held the edge in the 
first half Saturday was at 12-11 with 12:02 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino was up by nine with eight minutes left in the half, but even its 
tight defense and good shooting couldn't prevent the Tigers from shaving the 
lead to one at the break. Riverside's Michael Stewart hit a jumper at the 
buzzer to make the score 29-28 in favor of El Camino. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Zlatco Josic had 13 points for El Camino, and guard Van Myers had 
nine. Riverside was led by Bobby Joyce's 18 points.

TORRANCE'S TOM AAKER HAS GOOD CAUSE TO FINISH L.A. MARATHON TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although he enters two marathons a year, Tom Aaker of Torrance has never cared 
much about the extravagant prizes awarded to the top finisher or even about the 
several hundred dollars awarded to each of the first 10 runners who cross the 
finish line. 
</P>
<P>
Today won't be any different. 
</P>
<P>
While elite athletes conquer the 26.2-mile Los Angeles Marathon course with 
material goals in mind -- the top female and male finishers will each receive 
$26,385, a Mercedes-Benz sedan and an 18-karat gold sports watch -- Aaker will 
do it to help the needy. 
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old Aaker will run the fourth annual race through the streets of 
downtown Los Angeles to raise funds for victims of domestic violence and 
impoverished children. 
</P>
<P>
Aaker knows he doesn't stand a chance against the elite on such a grueling 
course. After all, he's only a semi-hardcore distance runner, training an 
average of 60 miles a week on Redondo Beach's bike path and West Torrance 
High's track. 
</P>
<P>
He maintains a strict diet and has finished five marathons (Boston, San 
Francisco, Portland and twice in Chicago), but he probably won't come close to 
matching the top female runner's time today, and he'll finish at least half an 
hour behind the top male runner. 
</P>
<P>
The monetary reward the 5-foot-11, 145-pound associate investment manager 
expects to receive from the race won't come from placing high. Instead, Aaker 
will get about $1 a mile from each of several sponsors -- after he finishes the 
course. 
</P>
<P>
"Those runners are so good," Aaker said, "and so far ahead that I never find 
myself running with them. I'm always quite a ways behind the leaders. I don't 
enter races to compete against others, specially not them. I do it because I 
really enjoy running, and I like to compete against myself." 
</P>
<P>
Aaker's best time, 2:54.57, came at the Chicago Marathon in 1987. His last big 
race was the Portland Marathon last September, which he ran in 3:19. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's L.A. Marathon winner, Martin Mondragon of Mexico, finished in 
2:10.11. The female winner, also from Mexico, was Blanca Haime, who ran it in 
2:36.11. 
</P>
<P>
Both Mondragon and Haime will compete today in a field of about 17,000 runners 
that includes Japan's Taisuke Kodama, former South African Mark Plaatjes and 
American Greg Meyer. Kodama's best mark (2:07.35) is very close to the world 
marathon record of 2:07.11, and Plaatjes has run a 2:08.58 marathon. 
</P>
<P>
The top women include Portugal's Rosa Mota and the Soviet Union's Zoya Ivanova. 
Mota has come within two minutes of the women's world marathon record of 
2:21.06, and Ivanova has come within about seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Stiff competition for a part-time runner who competes for fun and worthy 
causes. 
</P>
<P>
That's why Aaker, who graduated from Loyola Marymount University in 1984 and 
received a master's degree from Northwestern University in 1986, has found a 
different incentive to finish the lengthy race. 
</P>
<P>
He hopes to raise $1,000 in pledges, which will go to an All Nations Foundation 
camp in the Angeles National Forest. Since the 1920s, the foundation has 
operated camping programs for inner-city kids and battered women and children. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Holmes, Aaker's colleague at Prudential Capital Corp., asked him to 
represent the charity when she learned that he planned to run in the marathon. 
</P>
<P>
"He agreed right away," said Holmes, whose parents are volunteer workers for 
the charity foundation. "We raised about $7,000 last year. The race really 
helps us a lot. It's great that Tom is doing this." 
</P>
<P>
While Aaker is concentrating heavily on finishing today's marathon to collect 
the pledges, he plans to run in many more. He started running as a high school 
tennis player and completed his first marathon in San Francisco in 1986 in 
3:35. 
</P>
<P>
Marathons are a big part of his life, he says, just like shedding his suit and 
tie to prepare for a run on the beach at the end of a long work day. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to run in them forever," Aaker said. "I really do. I'm going to do 
this for a long time. I even want to run in a marathon overseas someday." 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, he'll dash through the not-so-scenic streets of downtown L.A. 
for a good cause.

LOSS MEANS TOROS MAY NOT GET PLAYOFF BERTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
They'll be watching and waiting for the word as early as Monday afternoon in 
Carson as to whether the Cal State Dominguez Hills basketball team gets another 
shot at postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
But the plain fact of the matter is, the Toros blew the easiest chance they had 
to advance in the NCAA Division II playoffs when they couldn't hold a 10-point 
lead Friday night and lost to scrappy Chapman College, 67-62, in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The stunning setback before 1,127 fans at Riverside City College in the 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. postseason basketball tournament probably 
cost the Toros a chance to advance, Dominguez Hills officials admitted. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Dave Yanai characterized his team's chances now as remote. 
</P>
<P>
"When you are at the mercy of a selection committee and you don't get into the 
finals of your own conference tournament, it is not very good odds," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 32 playoff teams are expected to be announced as early as Monday afternoon, 
according to Toro Athletic Director Dan Guerrero. But because of a quirk in 
scheduling, the brackets for the tournament will not be made public until next 
Sunday, and play will not begin until March 17. 
</P>
<P>
It's a good bet, however, that if the Toros (19-9) are selected, they would be 
sent to one of eight four-team regionals outside of California as a wild card. 
</P>
<P>
Before Friday's loss, most observers felt all the Toros needed to do was beat 
Chapman in the tournament opener to advance. 
</P>
<P>
And it appeared Dominguez Hills would do just that, leading by six points with 
19 seconds remaining. In two previous meetings Dominguez Hills had had little 
trouble with the Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
But back-to-back three-point shots by Chapman, the second with three seconds 
left in regulation, stunned Dominguez Hills. The Toros also missed the front 
end of three one-and-ones to close regulation play. In overtime they never got 
their composure back, handing Chapman six consecutive free throws to open the 
extra frame. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think our kids thought this game was in danger," said Yanai. 
</P>
<P>
Now the entire season may be. 
</P>
<P>
"Our conference is so tough, I feel Dominguez Hills deserves a post-season 
berth," Chapman Coach Rich Prospero said. 
</P>
<P>
Courtside observers were not stunned by the outcome, the third loss in four 
games for the Toros. 
</P>
<P>
"Chapman has been playing extremely well," said Riverside Coach John Masi, who 
was named CCAA coach of the year earlier Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In some bittersweet news for Dominguez Hills, senior center Anthony Blackmon, 
as expected, was named the most valuable player in the conference. In addition, 
sophomore guard Robert Barksdale was named to the all-conference first team and 
senior guard Derrick Clark to the second team. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills, which at one time had a school record nine-game winning 
streak, finished a game behind Riverside in the final regular-season race.

CSUN DOMINATES 5-TEAM MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are two ways to analyze Cal State Northridge's victory in a five-team 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. track and field meet at CSUN on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The first theory is based on the hypothesis that the Matadors are much better 
than Coach Don Strametz has let on. 
</P>
<P>
After all, Northridge lost its best sprinter (Kevin Hendrix) to academic 
ineligibility, and its best hurdler (Tyrone Jeffries) and best middle-distance 
runner (Will James) were sidelined with a back and leg injury, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Matadors won 11 of 19 events in the men's meet -- including six of nine 
individual races -- and defeated Cal State Los Angeles, 136-78. Cal Poly Pomona 
finished third with 54 points, followed by UC Riverside (22) and Chapman (one). 
Scoring was conducted on a six-four-three-two-one basis. 
</P>
<P>
The second theory -- one that is probably closer to reality -- is that Cal 
State L. A. Coach John Tansley did not run all of his top athletes, 
particularly in the sprints and hurdles, where the defending CCAA champion is 
traditionally strong. 
</P>
<P>
That does not mean, however, that Northridge was unimpressive. The Matador 
men's team added another individual to its list of NCAA Division II 
championship qualifiers (three) and produced numerous personal bests. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's meet, Darcy Arreola and Lolita Pile led the Lady Matadors to 
victory. Northridge totaled 129 points, followed by Cal State L. A. (60), 
Pomona (50), Riverside (10) and Chapman (one). 
</P>
<P>
Walt Stewart, a junior from Notre Dame High, won the high jump with a personal 
best of 7 feet, 1/2 inch to qualify for the Division II championships and move 
into a tie for third on the all-time Northridge list. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Albers, a junior transfer from Sierra College who qualified for the 
Division II meet two weeks ago, moved to eighth on the all-time Northridge list 
in the hammer throw with a 185-7 effort and Sasha Vujic won the 1,500 meters in 
a personal best of 3:56.09. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a super meet," Strametz said. "If I had known that neither Tyrone or 
Will would run in this meet, I never would have expected us to win by this 
much. 
</P>
<P>
"It just shows you what can happen when you get kids to believe in themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Vujic, a freshman from Burroughs High, is an example of that. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of the year, distance coach Bob Augello described Vujic as a 
"classic complainer," a talented runner but one who viewed everything in a 
negative way. Then six weeks ago, things began to change, according to Augello, 
as Vujic began to think positively and started to bear down in workouts. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't really say anything," Augello said. "His attitude just changed. He 
kind of said, 'OK. Just tell me what to do and I'll do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
The change in attitude is starting to pay off with a drop in times. 
</P>
<P>
A week and a half ago, he lowered his personal best in the 800 to 1:56 in a 
time trial and Saturday he passed leader Rich Hirschman of Pomona with 130 
meters to go, then blew him away in the homestretch. 
</P>
<P>
Vujic ran the last 440 yards in 59.3 seconds and the last 330 yards in 43 
seconds after running the first 440 in a pedestrian 66.9 and the first 880 in a 
sluggish 2:11.2. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt really strong," Vujic said. "When the early pace was slow, I was happy 
because I felt like they were playing into my hands. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very confident with a lap to go." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to Vujic's victory, there was little suspense in either of 
Arreola's wins. 
</P>
<P>
Running in her first track races since the Olympic Trials last July, Arreola 
ran 4:25.17 in the 1,500 and 9:40.35 in the 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
Both times meet NCAA Division II qualifying standards. Arreola is the defending 
national champion in both events. 
</P>
<P>
"She's going to run under nine minutes (in the 3,000) this year," Strametz said 
of Arreola, who has a best of 9:13.34. "The times she ran today were very 
easy." 
</P>
<P>
Pile was one of the meet's busiest competitors, winning the long jump (18-5 
1/2) and triple jump (39-0 1/4) and placing third in the 200 (25.38). 
</P>
<P>
She also ran the second leg for the victorious 400 relay team (48.2).

SAN PEDRO GETS 2ND CHANCE, WINS CITY BOYS' SOCCER TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For the San Pedro High boys' soccer team, anything is possible. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates, after being defeated, 4-3, on penalty kicks by Palisades during a 
City Section semifinal match Tuesday, received a bid to play in the final 
against top-ranked Belmont after officials discovered that seven Palisades 
players participated in an American Youth Soccer Organization invitational in 
Tucson, Ariz., the weekend prior to their game with San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
California Interscholastic Federation rules say high school athletes may not 
play in outside games while the high school season is in progress. 
</P>
<P>
"Our loss was due to a shootout, so I don't feel bad," San Pedro Coach Hank 
Nozaki said. "Its like the Lakers tying the Celtics and picking the five best 
free-throw shooters. "I feel we should be here." 
</P>
<P>
As if making it to the championship game wasn't enough, the second-ranked 
Pirates stunned Belmont, 4-3, in overtime to win their 11th consecutive game 
and second City title in three years. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro defeated the Sentinels, 1-0, for the championship in 1987, then lost 
to Reseda, 4-1, last year. 
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Jack Holt scored the game-winning goal with 11 minutes to play in 
overtime when his 40-yard shot hit the ground and bounced over the head of 
Belmont goalkeeper Roberto Campos into the middle of the net. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a shot," Holt said after the game. "I was trying for a corner (kick) 
but I guess I lucked out." 
</P>
<P>
"That was the worst time and worst place for that to happen," said Belmont 
Coach Nancy Carr-Swaim. 
</P>
<P>
Belmont halfback Jose Moran had evened the score, 3-3, with a 25-yard shot into 
the middle of the net after seven minutes had elapsed in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The Sentinels (15-2-0) got on the scoreboard early with halfback Jose 
Barahona's shot from five yards at the two-minute mark. However, San Pedro 
(14-0-1) chalked up three straight goals and took a 3-1 lead with six minutes 
remaining in the half. Before intermission, though, moran narrowed the lead to 
3-2.

ALEMANY WHIPS CHAMINADE, 22-3

<P>
By DAVID SALKIN Simi Valley 8, Millikan 7 -- Simi Valley Coach Mike Scyphers 
notched his 200t 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On paper, Chaminade High figured to play Alemany close Saturday in the second 
round of the Westside baseball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Four Eagles starters returned from last year's Southern Section 2-A Division 
playoff team, and, although Alemany plays in a larger division, the team is 
coming off a sub-par season. And that was with ace left-hander Joey Rosselli, 
who is out for at least a month because of a broken hand. 
</P>
<P>
Shows how much weight paper carries. 
</P>
<P>
Alemany broke open a 2-1 game with a seven-run fourth inning and went on to a 
22-3 win over visiting Chaminade. 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth, the Indians nearly doubled their fourth-inning output, scoring 13 
runs. Beauchemin and Jeff Ordana hit home runs in the inning. DAVID SALKIN Simi 
Valley 8, Millikan 7 -- Simi Valley Coach Mike Scyphers notched his 200th 
career victory as the Pioneers upset the second-ranked team in the Southern 
Section 5-A in a second-round game of the El Segundo tournament. "Its a 
coaching milestone," said Scyphers, in his 11th season. "It's kind of a big 
deal for me, but the 200th win is not as important as the second win of this 
tournament." Simi Valley (2-0) scored five seventh-inning runs to win. Joe 
Gordon, Chadd Johnson, Andy Hodgins and Greg Santos had hits in the inning. San 
Fernando 5, Crescenta Valley 1 -- Senior Frank Serna pitched a five-hitter for 
the Tigers in the La Canada tournament. Bobby Corrales was three for four for 
San Fernando. Johnny Najar and Jesse Romero each had two hits. Scott Gleason 
had a double and home run for Crescenta Valley. Kennedy 14, Beverly Hills 6 -- 
Travis Bourne belted a grand slam for Kennedy and Gino Tagliaferri hit a 
two-run home run in the Westside tournament. Shawn Madden was three for four 
with three runs batted in. Poly 4, Burbank 1 -- Eddie Chavez hit a solo home 
run in the third inning and went two for three for Poly in the La Canada 
tournament. Channel Islands 4, Fairfax 3 -- The Raiders scored the winning run 
in the seventh when Jacob Cruz hit his second double of the game to score Fred 
Rodriguez. Jimmy Davis hit a double and triple for Channel Islands and John 
Johnson hit a two-run home run. Chatsworth 19, Ventura 2 -- Derek Wallace 
pitched a one-hitter through five innings and struck out seven for the 
Chancellors in the Westside tournament. Wallace also hit a double, a home run 
and had two RBIs. Jason Evans hit a single, double, home run and had six RBIs. 
Taft 6, Westchester 5 -- Jason Shapiro hit a triple and single as Taft won its 
second consecutive Westside tournament game. Adam Zutler drove in the winning 
run with a sacrifice fly in the seventh. Montclair Prep 7, Harvard 5 -- Jared 
Baumblatt was three for four with a home run to lead Montclair Prep in the 
Westside tournament. Chris Stone and Jay Borenstein hit triples for 
Harvard.SOFTBALL La Reina 3, Oxnard 2 -- Sherry Sisco relieved Heather Carey 
and pitched out of a bases-loaded jam in the seventh to preserve the win in the 
Simi Valley tournament. Thousand Oaks 15-3, Antelope Valley 0-1 -- Alicia 
Zinner pitched a no-hitter with 11 strikeouts and no walks in the first game. 
In the second game, Jenny Hicks singled to score Erikka Gulbranson to break a 
1-1 tie in the fourth. Simi Valley 3, Lompoc 0 -- Chrissy Oliver allowed one 
hit and recorded a career-high 18 strikeouts in the Simi Valley tournament. 
Simi Valley 5, Notre Dame 0 -- Sophomore Heather Santiago allowed one hit and 
struck out eight in the Simi Valley tournament.

LINCOLN IMITATES LAKERS, WINS 2 IN A ROW

Lincoln star Aaron Wilhite said his team was just following the lead of the Los 
Angeles Lakers Saturday in the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
By defeating Clairemont, 89-59, in the San Diego Section Division III boys' 
basketball championship, Lincoln won back-to-back titles and pulled off what 
Wilhite described as something akin to the Lakers' consecutive NBA 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
"Back-to-back championships, just like the Lakers," said Wilhite, a senior 
center. 
</P>
<P>
Well, sort of. This was the first hurdle. Lincoln (27-1) advances to Southern 
Regional play and if things go according to plan, the Hornets will continue on 
to the State Division III final -- where they lost last year, 76-71, to Daly 
City Jefferson. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln Coach Ron Loneski isn't thinking that far ahead but did say: "The only 
thing I want to do is to win the last game we play." 
</P>
<P>
If Lincoln keeps playing as it did against Clairemont (13-16), a team it beat 
twice in the regular season by 20- and 23-point margins, the Hornets should 
fare well in the coming rounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Hornets set the tone by employing their familiar full-court pressure 
defense and opened the first quarter with a 7-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
By halftime, Lincoln led, 40-21. 
</P>
<P>
"We had hoped to handle their press a little better," said Clairemont Coach 
Greg Lee. "But they're an excellent team. They destroyed us on the boards, they 
pursue the ball wonderfully and they have a couple of superstars who you can 
play good defense against and they'll still score.." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Temple, Lincoln's leading scorer, scored 30 points. 
</P>
<P>
"After playing them twice I thought they would be tougher," he said. "In the 
first half we just tried to discourage them. I came out pretty sloppy, but 
Aaron (Wilhite) was hot at the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
Wilhite scored 15 of his 29 points in the first half. Temple had 10 points in 
the first two periods. 
</P>
<P>
Clairemont's Ray McDavid led all scorers with 32 points.

ENGER GIVES VISTA EDGE OVER SAN MARCOS, 65-51

<P>
A moment of silence, if you will, for San Marcos High School, a 65-51 loser 
Saturday to Vista in the San Diego Section Division II girls' basketball 
championship at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
After all, several moments of silence, along with Vista center Chris Enger, 
contributed to the Knights' demise. 
</P>
<P>
"We were still breathing too heavy (at the start), looking at that big 
scoreboard," San Marcos Coach Bob Kellison said. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about some serious droughts: 
</P>
<P>
 -- There was the start of the first quarter, when San Marcos (21-7) didn't 
score for the first 3:08. Shantell Paopao finally broke through with a 10-foot 
jumper to make the score 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The start of the second quarter was even more damaging. Trailing, 18-12, 
San Marcos watched Vista (26-3) score seven consecutive points before Susie 
O'Brien made a couple of free throws with 5:37 left. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The beginning-of-the-quarter blues continued for the Knights after 
halftime. Vista scored 11 of the first 14 second-half points to move ahead, 
44-26, with 5:22 left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
A large part of San Marcos' problems were located in the center of Vista's zone 
defense in the person of the 6-foot-4 Enger. She had 10 points and five 
rebounds in the first quarter alone, and her long arm span kept San Marcos 
players looking over their shoulders each time they got the ball inside. 
</P>
<P>
Enger, who averaged 27 points this year, finished with 26 points, 15 rebounds 
and six blocked shots. She wasn't the game's leading scorer -- O'Brien finished 
with 33 -- but she did earn her first Section championship. And that, for 
Enger, won the war against O'Brien, the county's leading scorer (29.9 points 
per game). 
</P>
<P>
"It's a relief and total happiness," Enger said. "At times, I thought about her 
(O'Brien), but I tried to put it out of my mind. She's really a good player." 
</P>
<P>
San Marcos' best chance to get back into the game came when Enger drew her 
fourth foul with about 4 1/2 minutes remaining in the third quarter. Vista 
Coach Joe DeMaria sat her down with his team ahead, 44-26, and San Marcos went 
on a 13-2 run, but it wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
"If we could have taken more advantage of the time she (Enger) was out, it 
could have been a different story," O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Enger: "I was just praying we could hold the lead or extend it." 
</P>
<P>
Vista held it. The Panthers had their smallest lead of the second half, 46-39, 
at the end of the third quarter. But Vista scored six consecutive points to 
open the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Christofferson added 20 points for Vista and Kelli Schott had 18, taking 
some of the burden off Enger. 
</P>
<P>
Paopao scored 12 for San Marcos.

The story line for Saturday's sloppy San Diego Section Division I girls' 
basketball championship -- or, more appropriately, the Betty Crocker Game of 
the Day (41 turnovers were produced) -- was set by halftime. 
</P>
<P>
And by game's end, the theme was clear. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Mesa made just three field goals. Three. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Point Loma won the title, 44-25, at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
What was surprising was that Mira Mesa, after making just one first-half field 
goal, trailed by just four at halftime, 16-12. And for all intents and 
purposes, the Marauders were in the game until the end of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But the final numbers were haunting: Mira Mesa was three of 30 from the field 
(10%). The Marauders made more three-point attempts (two) than two-point 
attempts (one). And pestered by a tight Point Loma man-to-man defense 
throughout, they turned the ball over 25 times. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an ugly, ugly game, but it was a great defensive game for us," Point 
Loma Coach Lee Trepanier said. "They had no man-to-man offense, which was 
really too bad because they're a better team than that." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, when unguarded, Mira Mesa shot very well: 17 of 22 from the free throw 
line (77%). That's why the Marauders were able to hang with Point Loma as long 
as they did. Tweet Castillo made a three-point shot and a two-pointer, and 
Carrie Carambas added another three-pointer. Other than that, it was all free 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Mesa Coach Gary Blevins was at a loss to explain. 
</P>
<P>
"We took a lot of shots, they just wouldn't fall for us," he said. "Point Loma 
was very aggressive, so we shot a lot of free throws. But the other shots just 
rolled off the rim for us." 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma wasn't all that much better. The Pointers were 17 of 54 (32%) from 
the field and seven of 15 (47%) from the free throw line. 
</P>
<P>
But Point Loma had Monica Filer, a slick 5-foot-6 point guard, to direct the 
offense and Tyeast Brown, an aggressive 6-0 center, to control the inside. 
Filer was the game's leading scorer with 20 points, and Brown grabbed 21 
rebounds to go with 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
"I was real nervous," Filer said. "I didn't settle down until halfway through 
the first quarter." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Drumm added 10 points for Point Loma.

<P>
After beginning the season with considerable untapped potential, Anne Casey has 
proven that she is a quick learner. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Diego Section girls' basketball final against defending-champion and 
top-seeded Ramona Saturday morning at the Sports Arena, Casey showed her 
determination as she helped University to a 54-46 victory and the Division III 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
Casey scored 20 points and pulled down 11 rebounds for third-seeded University 
(14-7), but her leadership and court presence was the clincher, according to 
University's first-year coach, Rob Gorney. 
</P>
<P>
"Casey is the head of this team," he said. "She pushed the ball and the 
intensity level and showed the leadership we needed to win." 
</P>
<P>
But months ago, as the season drew near, the senior forward was sorely lacking 
those qualities that would enable her to lead anyone anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"She had very few skills in the beginning," Gorney said. "She kept saying, 
'Teach me, teach me.' She's shown a 300% improvement." 
</P>
<P>
The majority of that improvement showed in the third quarter Saturday, when the 
Dons outscored Ramona, 18-4, for a 39-26 lead going into the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Casey made nine of 10 free throws and added one field goal. She also slowed 
down Ramona's leading scorer, Kris Miller, in the third quarter. Miller, who 
was averaging 16 points a game, was held to two free throws in the quarter and 
finished with 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
"(Casey) played harder than I've seen her play before," Ramona Coach Joe Bess 
said. "She came ready to play and took some balls away from us. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference was at the foul line," Bess said. "You can't give anyone that 
many free throws and expect to win." 
</P>
<P>
University made 17 of 28 free throws; Ramona six of nine. 
</P>
<P>
Ramona (20-4) had fallen behind, 12-6, after the first quarter, but, aided by 
Kendra Brunje's eight-point effort, managed to take a 22-21 lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, we were so intimidated by the Sports Arena," Casey said. "We were 
very intimidated by Ramona, and in the second quarter their intensity grew." 
</P>
<P>
So Gorney had a little chat with the Dons in the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave us a pep talk," Casey said. "That made the difference." 
</P>
<P>
"I screamed at them," Gorney said. "I told them we needed to screen out and be 
more effective on the boards, and we did." 
</P>
<P>
Ramona outscored University, 20-15, in the final quarter, but it was too late.

ASIAN BROKER SAYS 8 TEENS DIDN'T STEAL CHINESE SIGN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
An Asian real estate broker whose Chinese business sign has been repeatedly 
vandalized has asked that charges be dropped against eight high school students 
who were caught stealing the sign last month. 
</P>
<P>
The sign has been stolen five times since November and some city officials 
feared the thefts had been committed by racists opposed to the growing Chinese 
business presence in San Marino. 
</P>
<P>
But Caesar Wu, president of Golden Acres Realty, said he has talked with the 
students and believes they had nothing to do with the previous thefts and were 
only taking part in a club initiation. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt that they are telling the truth," he said. "I was young once, 
I made mistakes, too." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Decision Made 
</P>
<P>
Whether the charges of petty theft and vandalism will be dropped is up to the 
district attorney's office. "In a criminal prosecution a victim can't drop the 
charges," said Marguerite McKinney, a deputy district attorney in charge of 
Pasadena juvenile cases. No decision has been made, she said, on whether to 
drop the charges. 
</P>
<P>
But Wu said he will do everything in his power to help the students. 
</P>
<P>
"If it is legal, I won't testify against them," he said. "Having this mark 
against them will affect them for the rest of their lives. It is too much for 
them to pay." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Wu nor the police have any idea who is responsible for the other thefts 
of the sign. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Everything's Quiet' 
</P>
<P>
But since the arrest of the students, there have been no more attempts to pry 
the two Chinese characters off the building. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything's quiet," said Police Cmdr. Paul Butler. "I think we got a lot of 
peoples' attention and I don't think it's going to happen again." 
</P>
<P>
The students, who attend San Marino High School, were arrested about 11:30 
p.m., Feb. 4 after an officer noticed a car stopped behind the building on 
Huntington Drive. 
</P>
<P>
One student, Ronald C. Steffey, 18, was caught on the roof of the building near 
a plastic Chinese character that had been pried off the wall, police said. None 
of the other students were identified because they are juveniles. Police said 
the charges are misdemeanors. Steffey faces a fine of $1,000 or up to six 
months in County Jail. The juveniles would be turned over to Juvenile Court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Source of Controversy 
</P>
<P>
Steffey, who is scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday in Pasadena Superior Court, 
said none of his companions were aware of the controversy surrounding the sign 
and would never have touched it if they had known. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I've done wrong," Steffey said last month after his arrest. "It was 
such a stupid thing to do, but it had nothing to do with race." 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Acres Realty sign became a source of controversy in this quiet, 
wealthy city when it first appeared last November. 
</P>
<P>
Two other businesses in town use foreign words on their signs, but neither have 
experienced problems. One belongs to the Shanghai Palace restaurant, a longtime 
San Marino fixture; the other to East-West Federal Bank, which uses Chinese 
characters in its company logo. 
</P>
<P>
Wu was allowed under the city's sign ordinance to mount 10 Chinese characters 
on the building above the company's name in English. 
</P>
<P>
But the city asked Wu to reduce the number to four and ultimately to two to 
avoid provoking critics of signs that are not in English. 
</P>
<P>
Wu agreed, and put up the one-foot-high, blue plastic characters. 
</P>
<P>
But some residents still complained to Wu, City Hall and the police that the 
two characters had no place in San Marino. Some callers said they feared 
Huntington Drive would soon become another Valley Boulevard, a street in 
Alhambra that is one of the main Chinese commercial areas in the San Gabriel 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sign Was Stolen 
</P>
<P>
Within a few days the sign was stolen. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Paul Crowley wrote a letter to the San Marino Tribune calling for peace 
in the community and explaining that Wu's sign was perfectly legal. The police 
also increased patrols in the area. 
</P>
<P>
But the sign was stolen several more times. 
</P>
<P>
Since the arrest of the eight students, Wu has received about 100 phone calls. 
This time, however, the callers have all been supportive and have deplored the 
vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we all learned something from this experience," Wu said. "I learned to 
be friends with people no matter what their intentions. If you show your 
friendship, you can change peoples' attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
"Make friends, not enemies, that's the thing," he said.

30 TRANSLATORS TELL IMMIGRANT PARENTS HOW TO HELP CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
About 250 eager learners flocked to Rincon Intermediate School last Saturday, 
but they weren't trying to chalk up extra credit. They were parents attending a 
Rowland Unified School District conference on ways to give their children a 
boost in school. 
</P>
<P>
And they were learning in their native tongues. 
</P>
<P>
Some 30 translators with command of Spanish, Mandarin, Korean and Tagalog (for 
those from the Philippines) helped fill classrooms of the West Covina school 
with a cacophony of sound. 
</P>
<P>
Clusters of parents sat at tables around their respective translators during 
most of the lectures, usually conducted in English. Groups of parents would 
murmur, nod their heads in agreement and sometimes laugh a step or two behind 
the rest, after hearing the punch line in their language. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Orientation to Society 
</P>
<P>
The daylong Multilingual Parent University was the first districtwide parent 
workshop sponsored by the 19,000-student district, which includes Rowland 
Heights and portions of La Puente, Walnut and West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
The workshop was intended mainly as an orientation to American society for the 
district's ethnically diverse community, said Anaida Colon-Muniz, bilingual 
education coordinator for the district. 
</P>
<P>
Participants were given a package of curriculum summaries in English and 
Spanish, referral sources for psychological and drug treatment services, and 
brochures on parents' responsibilities in education. 
</P>
<P>
Colon-Muniz noted that the student population has undergone "a tremendous 
change" in ethnic composition over the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
The percentage of Latinos attending the 21 schools in the district has nearly 
doubled from 26% in 1970 to 46% today, while Asians increased from 5.3% to 22% 
in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
The workshop was the brainchild of Supt. Sharon Robison, who had a survey 
conducted in five languages last year to find out what topics parents would be 
most interested in hearing about. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drugs and Gangs 
</P>
<P>
About 26 speakers explored issues such as school culture, choices other than 
college, communicating with children, and parenting in America. 
</P>
<P>
Gus Frias, coordinator of Operation Safe School, an Orange County Department of 
Education anti-gang program, addressed the problems of drugs, gangs and peer 
pressure. Social worker Nancy Lin from McClaren Children's Center spoke in 
Mandarin about how to talk to children about school. 
</P>
<P>
Some parents asked how to approach sex education. Others did not understand 
their children's new-found rebelliousness. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them to insist on the big things," Lin said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Workshops 
</P>
<P>
Another speaker, Howard Kwon, advised immigrant parents to overcome feelings of 
powerlessness in a strange country and to not give their children too much 
freedom. The Korea-born Kwon is the special programs coordinator for the ABC 
Unified School District, with headquarters in Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
"Respecting parents -- we need to import that," Kwon told his listeners. 
"Fathers have the responsibility to guide." 
</P>
<P>
Among his audience in a Chinese-speaking cluster was Meng-I Pan, whose son 
arrived last fall from Taiwan. The kindergartener is struggling to learn 
English. 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't been here very long, so I want to help him understand the school 
environment," she said in Mandarin, adding that it was great having 
translators. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish they would have more (workshops) so I can learn more things," said 
Lourdes Vasquez. The mother of a first-grader at Northam Elementary School in 
La Puente, she left Mexico for California a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
She was pleased that her group got to watch a Spanish video on the possible 
reasons why a child misbehaves, while others watched a similar tape in English. 
Vasquez said she learned that she should calm down and talk to her children 
before getting angry at them for putting off doing homework. 
</P>
<P>
Samantha Moon, who emigrated from Korea six years ago, said she had learned a 
lot. She said she picked up valuable tips on ways to encourage her two 
elementary school-age sons to do their homework, such as reading with them 
instead of watching television. 
</P>
<P>
The workshop was also an effort to sensitize educators to the diversity they 
face, said Sally Mentor, associate superintendent of educational services. 
</P>
<P>
"Face-to-face contact is a powerful reminder of how much our community has 
changed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mentor is developing a seven-hour cultural training program for administrators 
and staff this fall. 
</P>
<P>
She said the district is concerned with issues deeper than obvious cultural 
differences such as dance or music. 
</P>
<P>
Using videotaped interviews with students and parents, her program will explore 
different gender expectations, how discipline is handled at home and how 
communications between schools and the home can be improved. 
</P>
<P>
Communication is essential because sometimes parents do not understand what 
certain classes may involve, she said. For example, she said some parents were 
shocked when their children performed at the end of a modern dance class. 
</P>
<P>
"They were moving their bodies in ways that in some cultures are totally 
unacceptable," Mentor said, adding that some parents were also surprised simply 
to see the dancers in tights.

DELAYS IN FINDING OPEN FACILITY FRUSTRATE PARAMEDICS, PUBLIC

Call 911 and in a few minutes chances are that paramedics will be on the scene 
to treat the patient and load him into an ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
But often these days, instead of speeding off, the ambulance just sits there, 
while friends and relatives of the victim grow impatient as frustrated 
paramedics wait for word on where to transport the victim. 
</P>
<P>
John Wilson, general manager of Crippen Ambulance Service in Covina, said the 
wait can stretch from five to 20 minutes. And even after an ambulance is on the 
way to a hospital, he said, it is not uncommon to be rerouted, meaning that 
family members, and perhaps the family doctor, are going to one hospital while 
the patient heads for another. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said such breakdowns in the emergency-care system are "causing a lot of 
grief." 
</P>
<P>
Patrick McAlmond, regional manager of Cole-Schaefer Ambulance Service in 
Pomona, said that in one case paramedics took a patient to three hospitals 
before finding one that would grant admittance. 
</P>
<P>
"Originally, the patient wasn't in bad shape," McAlmond said, but by the end of 
the ordeal, the condition had turned critical. While such an extreme example is 
rare, he said, there is no doubt that "the whole system is in a crunch." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
35-Minute Wait 
</P>
<P>
In a more typical case, a county Fire Department paramedic squad in South El 
Monte responded to an accident on the Pomona Freeway Thursday that involved six 
victims. The paramedics said they loaded the victims, none of whom were 
seriously injured, into ambulances and then sat on the freeway for 35 minutes 
waiting for direction. 
</P>
<P>
Each paramedic unit in the county is assigned to work with a base station 
hospital, which directs patient treatment by radio or telephone and tells the 
paramedics where to take their patients. Six hospitals in the San Gabriel 
Valley have been designated as base stations. 
</P>
<P>
If the nearest emergency room refuses to take the patient, the ambulance must 
wait while the base hospital searches for an alternative that is no more than 
10 minutes away, or in the case of a trauma center, within 20 minutes. If all 
the facilities contacted are closed, paramedics are instructed to take the 
patient to the nearest emergency room anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Eileen Rice, pre-hospital care coordinator at Methodist Hospital of Southern 
California in Arcadia, which is a paramedic base station, said there is no way 
of knowing in advance when a hospital will be too busy to handle another 
emergency, and so paramedics must await instructions on each run. "A lot of 
time," she said, "the wait seems longer than it is." 
</P>
<P>
County paramedic Bob Cormack said he was at the scene of an accident about six 
months ago on the 605 Freeway, near the Pomona Freeway, that involved 12 
victims. One of the victims, he said, was showing worrisome symptoms, and "I 
wanted to get her (to the hospital) as quickly as possible." But the accident 
was 100 feet outside the service area of a trauma center, he said, and it took 
45 minutes for his base hospital to persuade the trauma center to take the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Priority Patients 
</P>
<P>
Cormack said critically ill or injured patients receive priority and there is 
no delay in getting them to a hospital. He said the delays are occurring for 
patients who seem to have less serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
But one of the problems, he said, is that paramedics cannot assess everyone's 
condition with certainty. "We have good training and all," he said, "but we 
can't tell if someone is bleeding a lot inside." 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Price-Hastings, director of the county's paramedic and trauma hospital 
program, said she has heard so many reports about paramedics "standing around" 
at emergency scenes that such complaints "are probably valid." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem, she said, is the sheer volume of emergency calls. 
Paramedics countywide responded to 425,000 calls last year. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is the volume huge, but the calls tend to come in bunches, with more 
Thursday through Sunday than Monday through Wednesday, Price-Hastings said. 
Also, there is always a spurt in January and early February for reasons that 
are not entirely clear. "Some people attribute it to the flu season," she said. 
"Others say people are opening bills after Christmas and having heart attacks." 
</P>
<P>
Price-Hastings said hospitals are allowed to turn away ambulances with 
paramedics aboard because paramedics "have the ability to manage the patient." 
But hospitals cannot turn away emergency cases in which patients arrive at the 
hospital under their own power or in an ambulance without paramedics on board. 
</P>
<P>
Cormack, who works on a paramedic squad based in South El Monte, said that 
because local emergency rooms are closed so frequently, emergency runs that 
took an hour two years ago are now taking an hour and a half or more. 
</P>
<P>
"Patient care is really getting compromised," he said. "We do everything we can 
in the back of an ambulance . . . but there is only so much you can do back 
there. They've got a lot better equipment at the hospital, and they're a lot 
more trained than we are." 
</P>
<P>
In some cities, such as Pasadena, paramedics transport patients to the hospital 
in city ambulances. In other cities, such as those served by paramedics from 
the county Fire Department, patients are transported by private ambulance, with 
paramedics going along to the hospital only when necessary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refusing Care 
</P>
<P>
Cormack said that because paramedics often cannot take patients to their 
preferred hospital, people increasingly are refusing care and saying they will 
get to the hospital on their own. 
</P>
<P>
One ambulance company executive said he has heard of a case in which paramedics 
bailed out of an ambulance just before it reached a hospital so that the 
hospital would have to take the patient. A paramedic who works for a private 
ambulance company said he once heard a colleague advise a man who had 
complained of chest pains to have his wife drive him to the nearest emergency 
room and save himself an ambulance ride to a hospital farther away. 
</P>
<P>
McAlmond of Cole-Schaefer Ambulance Service and Rice of Methodist Hospital 
scoffed at those stories. "That would be tantamount to abandoning a patient," 
Rice said, adding that no paramedic would be foolish enough to risk the legal 
liability of leaving a patient on his own. McAlmond put it more simply: "If one 
of my paramedics did that, I'd kill him." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Dial 911' 
</P>
<P>
County Fire Capt. Eugene McCarthy, a paramedic coordinator, said some of the 
heavy load on paramedic services is coming from people who do not have the 
money or insurance to pay for care. "When the state cuts funding for health 
clinics," McCarthy said, "where do these people go? They dial 911." 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy estimated that 60% to 70% of the emergency calls that are answered by 
paramedic units do not require paramedic skills. He said eventually the county 
may have to adopt a system of having dispatchers decide whether a 911 call 
requires paramedics or could be handled by lesser-trained emergency medical 
technicians. He noted that Los Angeles and other cities are beginning to 
establish such priority systems. 
</P>
<P>
The county Fire Department has 40 paramedic squads, including 10 scattered 
through the San Gabriel Valley. In addition, eight engine companies have a 
single paramedic on duty who can assess a patient's condition and undertake 
some life-saving procedures until a two-member paramedic squad arrives. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy said the number of paramedic squads has not increased for at least 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
The county system is designed to get paramedics to the scene in eight to 10 
minutes, but in Claremont, city officials say the response time is often much 
longer than that, and they are seeking permission to have a private ambulance 
company provide paramedic service. 
</P>

Daniel G. Gold, president of Medic-1, said his company has offered to provide 
paramedics to Claremont without cost, and he believes that he can do so at a 
profit, charging customers for the service. 
</P>
<P>
But ambulance companies that provide paramedic services to Pomona and El Monte 
under a similar arrangement say they are losing money on the service. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Dolphin, who owns Medevac Inc. in El Monte, said his company reduced the 
number of paramedic units on duty at any one time in El Monte from two to one 
two years ago because revenue was not covering expenses. "It was draining the 
company," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dolphin said the business is unprofitable because so many patients fail to pay 
their bills. The county pays $3 million a year to ambulance companies to help 
pay for indigent patients, but Dolphin said the amount is not enough to cover 
the costs. 
</P>
<P>
In Pomona, McAlmond said Cole-Schaefer loses money on the paramedic service 
because only 53% of the patients pay their bills. Dolphin said the collection 
rate is even lower in El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fund-Raising Drive 
</P>
<P>
El Monte Fire Chief Leslie E. George said the city cannot afford to establish 
its own paramedic squad or pay Medevac or the county to provide supplemental 
service. As an alternative, George has embarked on a fund-raising effort to 
acquire defibrillators for each of the city's fire trucks so that firefighters 
will be equipped to treat cardiac arrests. 
</P>
<P>
The county Fire Department also has begun equipping all of its fire stations 
with defibrillators. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. McCarthy said that unless the funding problems are resolved so that 
hospital emergency rooms are open when needed, the strain on paramedic services 
will continue. 
</P>
<P>
"The paramedic system is just as fragile as the hospital system," he said. 
"When they collapse, we collapse." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Love What They Do' 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't a paramedic that I ever met who doesn't want to give good service, 
who doesn't want to get there as fast as he can," McCarthy said. "They love 
what they do. This job means everything to them." And so, he said, it is 
particularly frustrating to paramedics when they find themselves out in the 
field at the scene of emergency waiting for direction. 
</P>
<P>
County paramedic Jeff Kaliher, who is based in South El Monte, said he 
responded recently to an emergency call from a woman who had abdominal pain. 
The woman's boyfriend became irate, Kaliher said, because "we couldn't go 
anywhere until we found out what hospital was open. The man was screaming at 
us, 'Do something! You guys aren't doing anything!' " 
</P>
<P>
Kaliher said that whenever there is a delay of that sort, "We try to explain 
(the problem) to them, but they don't understand."

OVERFLOW FROM L.A. HOSPITALS FINDS ITS WAY TO THE SUBURBS

<TEXT>
<P>
When the ambulance arrived at the corner of Figueroa Street and Avenue 26 in 
Los Angeles, the paramedics found a man named Victor lying in the darkness. He 
had been stabbed in the back. 
</P>
<P>
Another argument in the city had gotten nasty. Another victim's rescuers would 
wonder where to take a patient. 
</P>
<P>
Ordinarily, a stabbing victim would be taken to a nearby Los Angeles hospital 
for treatment. But on this Saturday night, the emergency rooms of the nearest 
city hospitals, County-USC Medical Center and White Memorial Medical Center in 
Boyle Heights were full. So instead, the ambulance headed northeast to 
Pasadena's Huntington Memorial Hospital, the San Gabriel Valley's largest 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
As hospitals in Los Angeles have become crowded, a ripple effect is occurring: 
Beds in suburban hospitals like Huntington are filling with the ill and the 
injured from outside the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
By no means an epidemic in the San Gabriel Valley, the situation nonetheless 
has the potential, Huntington officials say, to threaten the quality as well as 
the cost of health care in the region. 
</P>
<P>
The events during a swing shift on a Saturday last month illustrate a typical 
day at Huntington, licensed for 606 beds. 
</P>
<P>
During the shift, the specter of Huntington's emergency room closing loomed no 
farther away than a bulletin board in the Emergency Department. There, on a 
wall behind two-way radios and emergency telephones, the board graphically 
recorded which area hospitals that were, in one way or another, full. 
</P>
<P>
Within Huntington's immediate area four hospitals could take no more critically 
injured patients. Alhambra Community Hospital, County-USC, Garfield Medical 
Center in Monterey Park and San Gabriel Valley Medical Center in San Gabriel 
all were closed. 
</P>
<P>
Yet somehow, Huntington was able to maintain enough beds for critically injured 
patients. In mid-afternoon, when the shift began, there were 12 beds available, 
and when the shift ended at midnight, 12 beds were still available. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, a constant stream of Pasadena's wounded and sick flowed through 
the doors of the emergency room. Patients complained of constipation or 
headaches or back pain. Mothers carted in their feverish babies. A 
do-it-yourself carpenter had cut his thigh with a power saw. 
</P>
<P>
And through it all, the beeps of emergency phones pierced the air. 
</P>
<P>
During the shift, one man would die from a heart attack he had suffered at 
home. One woman who lived in a Pasadena motel would call 911 and, minutes 
later, in what would be her first contact with a medical professional during 
eight months of pregnancy, give birth to a girl. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens more patients -- 67 in all -- would be treated. And of this group, 16 
would be admitted, including two who ordinarily would have gone to other 
hospitals had those facilities not been temporarily closed, a situation 
Huntington had faced in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 9, for the first time recent memory, Huntington's emergency room was 
temporarily closed, hospital officials said. The reason cited was crowded 
conditions. On two other occasions later that month Huntington was forced to 
close its emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
Also during January, the hospital temporarily closed three times because of a 
lack of available critical care beds, and its trauma center closed four times. 
The center, with a specialized staff on duty round-the-clock, handles the 
emergency room's most severe cases involving traffic accidents, gunshot and 
stab wounds, and extreme multiple injuries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drug-Related Trauma 
</P>
<P>
Betty Briggs, Huntington's administrative director of ambulatory services, sees 
these closings as a growing problem. She cites more trauma cases, which she 
says are frequently an outgrowth of drug abuse. She also lists population 
growth and an increasing number of elderly residents who defer care until they 
are forced to go to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Still, she says, "People think closing means locking the door. But closing is 
only an attempt to divert paramedics and ambulances. Even though we're 
technically closed, you can't lock the door and let somebody bleed on the 
ramp." 
</P>
<P>
And Barbara Kelly, an assistant head nurse in the emergency room says: "It's 
not our philosophy to argue with the paramedics. You waste time arguing over 
where (patients) should go. And closing is not a decision based on a number. 
You stay open as long as you can safely care for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
While taking a break midway through a weekend shift, Dr. Donald J. Gaspard, 
head of Huntington's trauma center, gave this example of how overcrowding in 
Los Angeles hospitals affect those in the suburbs: 
</P>
<P>
Upstairs, the surgeon said, a patient who was brought from downtown Los Angeles 
three nights earlier was recovering from a butcher-knife wound to the chest. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, the patient would have been taken to the closest trauma center, 
County-USC Medical Center. But it was temporarily closed because of 
overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
"The patients who live in the San Gabriel Valley can be well cared for by 
hospitals here," Gaspard said. "The crisis is not that the black hole is 
creeping this way. The crisis is we really are our brother's keeper. And when 
these (Los Angeles) trauma centers close, the patients roost here." 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the man with the butcher-knife wound, he had neither insurance 
nor a home. He represented, Gaspard said, the increasing number of uninsured, 
traumatically injured patients diverted from Los Angeles. Calling this a 
"domino effect," Gaspard said that it is "real and it's going to impact people 
(even if) they've got a Blue Cross policy." 
</P>
<P>
One outcome, he said, is higher operating costs for hospitals -- the very 
reason cited by eight county hospitals within recent years for permanently 
closing their trauma centers. Huntington's center is the only one now open in 
the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
For the Huntington trauma center, the pace of the Saturday swing shift last 
month was busy, but never busy enough to require closure. And at 4:21 p.m. a 
nurse wiped away the word "closed" by the San Gabriel Medical Center's entry on 
the bulletin board. 
</P>
<P>
Then, just six minutes later, a yellow flashing light in the corridors signaled 
a "code yellow," the trauma designation. Soon, a team of 20 hospital staffers, 
ranging from social workers to nurses, surgeons and X-ray technicians, gathered 
in the trauma center, the Emergency Department's largest treatment room, to 
await their patient. 
</P>
<P>
On the roof, a Sheriff's Department helicopter was landing. This was the second 
of three trips the helicopter rescue team would make to the hospital on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In this instance, it was a mountain rescue from the eastern county line near 
Wrightwood. Initially, the helicopter had been scheduled to take its 
14-year-old patient to Glendale Adventist Hospital, which has no trauma center 
but does have 24-hour emergency care. 
</P>
<P>
But the injured boy, who had smashed his head on snow and ice, began vomiting 
and losing consciousness. Because he had a severe head injury, combined with 
the other symptoms, he was now considered a trauma victim -- someone whose 
injuries might kill him. So the helicopter changed its course from Glendale and 
headed toward Huntington. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, when the county's trauma center system was established, 
helicopter rescuers coming from the mountains had many more choices. Then, 
Pomona Valley Hospital in Pomona, Queen of the Valley in West Covina and 
Methodist Hospital of Arcadia all operated trauma centers. But the hospitals 
have since closed them. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the injured boy, the lack of a trauma center closer than 
Huntington did not become crucial, although the helicopter ride took longer and 
the boy's pain was prolonged. Within minutes after the victim's arrival at 
Huntington, in a blur of medical assessments, Gaspard and the staff concluded 
that the boy had no life-threatening injuries, even though his body had 
suffered an extreme shock. 
</P>
<P>
"Trauma is the province of the young," Gaspard said after treating the 
youngster, noting that many of the patients brought into trauma centers are 
males who are teen-agers or in their 20s. "There are 1,000 traumatic injuries a 
month in the county." 
</P>
<P>
Those numbers combine with the fact that many trauma patients have no 
insurance. At Huntington, he said, 60% are uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
This means, he said, that Huntington's trauma center has become "an expensive 
piece of real estate. We can't pay the rent. We're losing a $1 million a year." 
</P>
<P>
And this worsening situation, he said, exacerbates the overcrowding in the 
emergency room. The pressures on emergency rooms, Gaspard said, result from 
their functioning as clinics for the impoverished, for illegal aliens and for 
the working poor, who can't afford insurance or have minimal insurance. Because 
of this, he said, people see a physician only under dire circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"There are too many people who don't have access to good care. Society has to 
make a fundamental decision what to do about the patient who can't pay -- kill 
them, export them, package them, or care for them. But you can't let them run 
around and bankrupt the health care system." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, Gaspard said, Huntington remains committed to its emergency room 
and trauma center. But because of the permanent and temporary closures of 
trauma centers, he said, it has become more difficult for patients to get the 
care that is available through medical science and is rightfully demanded by 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate, he told the story of a worker who fell from scaffolding in 
Glendale and later died: 
</P>
<P>
Because of the severity of the man's injuries, he needed to be taken to a 
trauma center. The nearest ones, St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, 
Huntington and County-USC, were closed. So the paramedics were instructed to 
take him to the next-closest emergency room, Verdugo Hills in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
But when the victim arrived at Verdugo Hills, doctors there said he needed a 
neurosurgeon. The hospital had none. Eventually, Huntington reopened its trauma 
center to accept him. But four hours had elapsed from the time the man fell to 
when he was seen by neurosurgeons at Huntington. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether he had been treated right away in a trauma center and could have 
survived," Gaspard said, "is an unknown. The answer is, probably not. But if he 
was going to be saved, the more promptly he got the right treatment, the more 
likely it is that he would have been saved." 
</P>
<P>
On the swing shift at Huntington, only one case was as extreme. And neither the 
paramedics nor the emergency room staff could save a 64-year-old Pasadena man 
who had been rushed to the hospital at one of the busiest times, about 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Although the staff, which included eight registered nurses and two physicians, 
was not distracted by other emergencies, the man had arrived too late to save. 
As a curtain finally was drawn around the table where the man's body lay, Dr. 
Michael Page and social worker Scott Skyles went to another room to comfort the 
widow. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the waiting room, most of the three dozen seats were filled. A 
dozen clipboards were spread around a counter-top desk where the staff was 
reviewing cases and deciding who needed care first. 
</P>
<P>
A stretcher carrying the man named Victor, bleeding from a stab wound, sailed 
through the pneumatic doors. 
</P>
<P>
In one treatment room a dilemma was being resolved with a deaf San Marino 
octogenarian who didn't speak English . On a bed in the hallway, a Pasadena man 
who suffered grand mal seizures, was awaiting a visit from the doctor. He had 
been placed in the hall so the staff could keep a closer watch on him. 
</P>
<P>
Next to him lay a homeless man who had been attacked on a Pasadena street. His 
head was bandaged, his face bloodied. He smelled like he had been drinking and 
he complained of pain. 
</P>
<P>
Nurses began asking Victor questions he did not want to answer. His hands were 
soiled. He flailed around an examining table as one nurse took off his jacket. 
He said he had no home. And he had no insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know where you are?" the nurse asked. 
</P>
<P>
"L.A." he said groggily. 
</P>
<P>
"Pretty close. Pasadena." 
</P>
<P>
A Q-tip the doctor inserted into his stab wound showed that it was deep, but 
not as serious as it might have been. Little time would be needed to give him 
stitches. 
</P>
<P>
By the next morning, he was discharged. And so was the other homeless man who 
had come three days earlier with the butcher knife wound to the chest. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Memorial Hospital now was two more beds further away from having to 
close its doors again.

A NUCLEAR SUB IS NO TRIBUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The press, including The Times, recently reported on the commissioning 
ceremonies for a new U.S. nuclear-powered attack submarine named after 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
In ready compliance with the Navy's public relations campaign, several 
Pasadena-area dignitaries attended the commissioning ceremonies. Mayor William 
Thomson, Vice Mayor Jess Hughston, Director John Crowley and Rep. Carlos J. 
Moorhead (R-Glendale) were all on hand to bestow their blessings on the sub. 
</P>
<P>
Thomson's remarks that Pasadena is "fortunate" and "honored" to have the 
submarine named after it have met with favorable editorial response by one 
local newspaper. But before anyone breaks into jubilant celebration, I think 
the citizens of Pasadena deserve to know more about the Pasadena than has been 
reported by the press. 
</P>
<P>
A front-page story in the Feb. 12 Star-News mentioned that the sub comes 
equipped with cruise missiles. Even less was revealed about the sub in The 
Times. Unfortunately, none of the press reported that some of these missiles 
are tipped with 200-kiloton nuclear warheads that have an explosive force 15 
times more powerful than the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, these missiles have a range of 1,500 miles, pinpoint accuracy and 
capabilities that make them potential first-strike weapons. Because it is 
extremely difficult to distinguish between cruise missiles with nuclear or 
conventional warheads, such weapons present verification nightmares for 
attempts to ensure compliance with nuclear arms controls. They will make 
negotiations for future arms control treaties much more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
In a time of massive federal debt, greatly decreased Cold War tensions and 
critical human needs in Pasadena and other San Gabriel Valley communities, it 
seems difficult to justify the expenditure of the $800 million it took to build 
this single submarine. 
</P>
<P>
I call on Thomson, Hughston, Crowley and Moorhead to explain to the citizens of 
Pasadena why we need to deploy this submarine when the U.S. nuclear arsenal 
already contains the equivalent of two tons of TNT for every man, woman and 
child on this planet. I ask them to explain why they support the deployment of 
weapons that have first-strike capabilities and can only make new arms control 
treaties more difficult to obtain. And finally, I ask them why they expect 
Pasadena citizens to celebrate this $800-million expenditure when they know the 
critical human needs of Pasadena and many other communities. 
</P>
<P>
To these Pasadena civic leaders I say "congratulations." You have done your 
part to perpetuate the ever-more threatening and ruinously expensive arms race. 
I'm sorry, but I do not share your pride and joy in the commissioning of the 
Pasadena.

FALLOUT FROM INCINERATOR PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bellflower City Councilman William Pendleton has proposed building a 
waste-to-energy incinerator at the Puente Hills landfill. He also stated that a 
lot of opinion against waste-to-energy is formed through hysteria, ignorance 
and misinformation. 
</P>
<P>
I disagree with both his proposal and his characterization. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte has strongly opposed waste-to-energy incinerators in the Los Angeles 
Basin. Among the many reasons are their contribution to air pollution and the 
toxicity of their ash. 
</P>
<P>
We have particularly opposed the incinerator previously planned for Puente 
Hills. The San Gabriel Valley is already the depository of a disproportionate 
share of the county's trash. 
</P>
<P>
In the last four years, our City Council has spent literally thousands of hours 
and thousands of dollars studying waste-to-energy. We have not only attended 
seminars, we have sponsored them. Our experience shows that opponents of 
waste-to-energy are knowledgeable, well-informed and scientifically supported. 
</P>
<P>
While we oppose any waste-to-energy facilities in the Los Angeles Basin, we 
suggest that if Pendleton really wants to build one, he build it in Bellflower. 
We also urge him to use state-of-the-art technology to confine the resulting 
air pollution and toxic ash to his own community.

THERE'S A NEW GERALDO...SORT OF; 
</P>
<P>
RIVERA' STILL A TV OUTLAW, BUT HE'S MOVING INTO NEW CORPORATE, PERSONAL AND 
PROFESSIONAL WORLDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McDOUGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's 6:30 p.m. on Santa Monica Boulevard and some clown in a yellow Porsche has 
just cut off the most famous Puerto Rican Jew in America. 
</P>
<P>
Geraldo Rivera cursed mildly. He hit the brakes and swerved his rented Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time not long ago when he admits he might have chased the Porsche 
down, jumped out and confronted the driver. But this evening, he avoids 
confrontation. Strange, considering his now-famous program that ended up with a 
neo-Nazi brawl and Rivera sporting a broken nose from a thrown chair. 
</P>
<P>
After the close call with the Porsche, he turns to reassure his 10-year-old son 
in the back seat. "It's all right. It's OK," he called over his right shoulder 
to Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
It's the "new Geraldo," according to his executive producer and long-time 
friend Marty Berman. He is a changed man: monogamous and moderate. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Though he still portrays himself as a romantic rebel, the crusading storefront 
lawyer-turned-journalist of the '70s sounds suspiciously like a yuppified 
capitalist these days. With the announcement last month that he and four 
partners (including Cheech Marin of Cheech &amp; Chong comedy fame) would be 
buying up TV stations, Rivera discovered the wonderful world of corporate 
power. 
</P>
<P>
The way he described it, his flight into Los Angeles three weeks ago on 
broadcast magnate George Gillett's private Challenger jet was as intoxicating 
as Rivera's favorite before-dinner drink, Tanqueray and tonic. If Gillett was 
trying to woo Rivera and his partners in the newly formed Maravilla (English 
translation: Marvelous) Communications to buy one of his stations, he was doing 
a splendid job. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never forget, sitting in the back of George Gillett's private jet, flying 
into Burbank, talking deals to Cheech (in Malibu) on the phone," said Rivera. 
"It was just such a trip!" 
</P>
<P>
Big bucks is nothing new to Rivera. When he was fired from ABC-TV 3 1/2 years 
ago at the top of his game, he was reportedly pulling about $800,000 a year. He 
had a pricey apartment on West 64th Street in Manhattan, a Malibu beach house, 
a yacht, Cadillac, Jaguar. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing he didn't have to divvy up in his 1984 divorce from Sheri 
Rivera, his third wife, was the Jaguar. (He still keeps the classic 1954 beauty 
garaged here so that he can tool around the freeways on his three or four 
visits a year from his New York home.) 
</P>
<P>
In the past, his investment interests have been show-business garden variety: 
stocks, bonds, his own production companies, insurance policies and, for the 
sake of speculation, a few gas, oil and shopping center partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
But with the success of "Geraldo," all that has changed. 
</P>
<P>
First, Rivera developed his Investigative News Group production company. In 
conjunction with Tribune Broadcasting, which underwrote his talk show and his 
hugely successful syndicated specials, ING will undertake a new weekly TV 
magazine later this year entitled "The Investigators." Like his non-network 
talk show, "The Investigators" will not have to use union crews, a situation 
that substantially cuts production costs. 
</P>
<P>
"Combined with the new technology, that's going to make it very cost-effective 
to produce these kind of shows," said David Hyslop, vice president of VTE 
Productions, a non-union video production service that contracts with ING to 
produce "Geraldo" when the show originates from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
With a $200,000-per-week budget, "The Investigators," as Rivera envisions it, 
will be his own flashy version of a "20/20" program with Rivera at the anchor 
desk. Tribune originally planned to launch the program in January, but Rivera 
says he decided to hold off until the current deluge of tabloid TV programs 
("Inside Edition," "A Current Affair," "USA Today," etc.), "kill each other 
off." 
</P>
<P>
Rivera sees "The Investigators" as his return -- on his own terms -- to 
mainstream, nighttime TV. So he doesn't want to debut in an atmosphere of 
anti-Rivera hysteria, he says. 
</P>
<P>
The other aspect of the new, more fiscally conservative Geraldo Rivera is 
Miravella. 
</P>
<P>
Using an infrequently invoked minority-ownership regulation instituted by the 
Federal Communications Commission a decade ago, five men teamed last month to 
begin buying their own network of TV stations -- Rivera; Marin; former New York 
Rep. Herman Badillo; Marcellino Miyares, owner of Times Square Studios, and 
Tony Bonilla Sr., chairman of the National Hispanic Leadership Conference. 
</P>
<P>
According to Rivera, there are currently 44 on the market and Miravella is 
bidding for all. He predicts flatly that the partnership will own its first 
station by April. 
</P>
<P>
The key to their edge is an FCC ruling that gives huge capital gains tax breaks 
to station owners who sell their licenses to minorities. 
</P>
<P>
"If everybody else goes in and offers $100 million, we can offer $95 million," 
he said. The deferral granted the seller on capital gains taxes is so sweet 
that it will put Miravella in a terrific bargaining position, Rivera said. 
</P>
<P>
Within a few years, Miravella could be in the same league as some of the other 
multiple-station groups, including Gillett Group Inc., which counts KSBW-TV in 
Salinas and KSBY-TV in San Luis Obispo among its stable of seven lucrative TV 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sitting there in George Gillett's jet, making calls to bankers and my 
business partners and business reps," Rivera recalled. "And I just stopped at 
one point and had the best belly laugh. All by myself, sitting in the back of 
that jet. If somebody had seen me, they would have thought I was a lunatic. A 
crazy man. I was just laughing out loud about how the worm has turned." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, Geraldo was certainly not anywhere near the concerned parent, 
reflective businessman or monogamous mate that he now claims to be. Back then, 
the fiery crusader with the lantern jaw and lust for work and women was 
invincible, immortal, insatiable, insufferable. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very arrogant," said one former ABC colleague. "Bolder than appropriate 
in dealing with people. Geraldo was always somebody who crossed the line -- a 
bad boy who tended toward sensationalism and sacrificed accuracy. He never 
would have become an anchor at ABC, so it was probably a blessing for him that 
he was fired." 
</P>
<P>
There's still plenty of the old Geraldo: the one who grows edgy when he's 
prepping for a show; who poses indiscriminately for publicity shots and rarely 
declines autograph requests; who speaks blithely of himself as a pioneering 
broadcast newsman on a par with Edward R. Murrow. 
</P>
<P>
"I truly believe -- and it sounds so arrogant that I hesitate to tell you -- 
but I really believe that there will be a retrospective look at my career when 
I'm no longer a threat, when I'm no longer a player on the front stage," he 
said. "I really think when you get away from the people who are analyzing or 
reviewing what I've done now, I think you'll see a real reassessment of the 
journalism of Geraldo Rivera." 
</P>
<P>
But there is a genuine once-burned, twice-shy deference in the new Geraldo too. 
Ten years ago, the ex-gang member ("The Corner Boys and, after I got my driver 
license, the Valve Grinders . . . our graphic was a valve with wings on it . . 
. ," he recalls), was still working on his angry-young-man television image. At 
35, he could swagger without ever leaving his chair. 
</P>
<P>
Off camera, when the whim hit him, he worked on his third marriage. But he 
never outgrew his reputation as a globe-trotting, macho, party-till-you-puke 
Lothario. Like the first two marriages -- to a pre-TV sweetheart and, later on, 
to the daughter of author Kurt Vonnegut -- his third trip to the altar (to his 
ABC-TV producer, Sheri Raymond) ended in divorce in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
He remarried in 1987, again to one of his producers: C. C. Dyer. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time I've worn a wedding ring," he said proudly. "Monogamy 
feels good." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, he made similar statements about Sheri Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
But the changes are profound, subtle and real this time, Rivera swears. He 
learned his lesson well when his third marriage collapsed and he was fired from 
ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
On another day, Rivera is in front of a studio audience at Universal Studios, 
discussing transsexuality for the next taping of "Geraldo." The episode will 
air in Los Angeles at 4 p.m., just as school is getting out. If Rivera sees any 
ambiguity between his protective paternal role off camera and his titilating 
showmanship on camera, he doesn't show it. As his current wife and producer, 
C.C. Dyer puts it: "Kids have seen everything and heard even more at school. 
This doesn't shock them." And Rivera, listening to her comments, doesn't 
dispute her conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, for instance, KCBS-TV, Channel 2, promoted the "Geraldo" lineup this 
way: 
</P>
<P>
Monday: "Wanted: Elvis! Dead or Alive." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday: "Drag Queens on Parade." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday: "Exploring Satan's Black Market." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday: "Sexual Secrets . . . To Tell or Not to Tell." 
</P>
<P>
Friday: "Teen Lesbians and Their Moms." 
</P>
<P>
"Who are your influential critics really, though?" Rivera asks. "You have to 
distinguish between influence within the industry and influence with the 
viewers. Critics are really not influential at all. TV is not like Broadway 
where everybody rushes out to see what the reviews are. That must be so 
frustrating for a critic. They have no power to influence the people watching. 
If anything, they just keep my name in the news." 
</P>
<P>
During his 20 years in television, he has polarized his colleagues and audience 
alike. It's tough to find a TV critic anywhere who has much nice to say about 
Rivera: 
</P>
<P>
"You know sensationalism is back in style. . . . when Geraldo Rivera is riding 
high" -- Richard Zoglin, Time Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"The trend grows and so does the stench" -- Phil Kloer, Cox News Service. 
</P>
<P>
"His narcissism overwhelms his news sense . . ." -- Charles Leerhsen, Newsweek. 
</P>
<P>
"Geraldo Rivera should be arrested for exposing himself" -- Reuven Frank, 
former NBC News president. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no subject . . . that Rivera can't trivialize with his tactics." -- 
Howard Rosenberg, the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
Rivera says he cares what critics say about him, but not much. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
The year before he became a father, Geraldo was still light years away from 
that realization. In a 1978 Playboy interview, he spoke about how he had 
changed since he first entered television journalism in 1970: 
</P>
<P>
"I was definitely arrogant and pushy, but I was other things too . . . 
arrogance is definitely part of my life. My defense against criticism has 
always been arrogance. I would always answer my critics by saying: 'What do you 
know? When was the last time you were in the streets? What have you lived 
through? What have you seen?' " 
</P>
<P>
Rivera himself was about to live through the disintegration of his marriage, 
his career as an ABC News star and fatherhood. 
</P>
<P>
Gabriel Miguel Rivera was born in July, 1979. In the divorce settlement that 
followed five years later, he became the pawn in an expensive California court 
battle. Eventually, Geraldo agreed to pay ex-wife Sheri $25,000 a month in 
spousal and child support. As of last July, at the height of Rivera's 
renaissance as the nation's most reviled and/or respected video talk show host, 
the monthly support payment dropped to $21,500. 
</P>
<P>
But Rivera -- the middle-class, middle child of a Puerto Rican father and 
Jewish mother, born 46 years ago come this July -- has few regrets. 
</P>
<P>
On his left shoulder, he wears a tattoo with his fourth wife's initials 
surrounded by a pattern of intertwining lines. Except for the initials, which 
are recent additions, the tattoo dates back to his days as a merchant marine in 
the early '60s. 
</P>
<P>
At the joint between thumb and index finger of his right hand, he has a second 
tattoo. 
</P>
<P>
"It was self-inflicted at a very early age -- a sort of a gang I.D. like the 
pachuco cross," he said. "But I just didn't think it was appropriate to have a 
cross there so I elaborated and darkened it in to make the Jewish star." 
</P>
<P>
As far back as 1973, Rivera has had to battle the myth that his real name is 
Gerry Rivers and that his Long Island upbringing was one of privilege, not 
poverty. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, the Gerry part is right," he said. "I'm sure that Peter Jennings was 
Pete when he was young too. But the Rivers part is bogus. It's just such a good 
story that it feeds on itself. It's one of those great rumors and my detractors 
think it's wonderful because they can say: 'Aha! That's the reason he's gone so 
far! 'Cause he pulled a scam! He rode the minority thing!' 
</P>
<P>
"It's an easy way to minimize me or explain me away. I mean, I went so far as 
to put my dad on TV. I showed my passport on TV.It just got so frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
His father, Cruz Rivera, died a year ago on Thanksgiving. Geraldo speaks of him 
wistfully and with genuine reverence. Like his son, the elder Rivera lost his 
job after more than 15 years with his company. When he was fired as a kitchen 
supervisor in a Long Island airplane factory, he bought a diner that later went 
bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
"I cooked for him on the night shift while I went to law school," Geraldo 
recalled. "My father never earned more than $200 a week." 
</P>
<P>
From his syndicated show, his specials, his four books and all of his other 
investments, Rivera earns well over $1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
His youngest brother, Craig, is following in Geraldo's footsteps with his own 
sensational reporting on the new syndicated nightly news magazine, "Inside 
Edition." The remaining members of the Rivera family have done moderately well. 
</P>
<P>
His older sister is a parochial school principal. 
</P>
<P>
His older brother is a shop steward in the Steamfitter's Union. 
</P>
<P>
What set Geraldo apart from them was a lot of blind luck. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that life is a series of random chances and what you make of your 
life is what you make of those chances," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He worked his way through college at the University of Arizona selling men's 
clothes and going to sea from time to time with the merchant marine. After 
graduation in 1965, he returned to New York and went to the Brooklyn College of 
Law and later passed the bar. 
</P>
<P>
By then, Gerry had metamorphosed into Geraldo: spokesman for a group of New 
York City Latino activists calling themselves the Young Lords. During one 
well-covered demonstration, Rivera became such a frequent presence on the 
nightly news that WABC-TV hired him to fill a temporary on-camera reporting 
slot to satisfy federal minority-hiring quotas. 
</P>
<P>
From that point, Rivera began seizing the random chances and making them work 
for him: "ABC World News Tonight," "Good Night, America," "Good Morning, 
America," "20/20." 
</P>
<P>
Even at his nadir, when he lost his job at ABC, he never lost the common, 
maudlin touch of playing out random chances to his own best advantage. In an 
often sappy but introspective article written for Esquire in 1985, Rivera 
announced that he and C. C. would take off on an Atlantic-to-Pacific cruise 
aboard Rivera's yacht and try to find a way out of a mid-life crisis he was 
going through. 
</P>
<P>
Four years later, he's thinking about owning a string of TV stations. When 
asked if he successfully found the way out of his mid-life crisis, he answers 
with his own question. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you think?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
Rivera -- even the new one -- makes no apologies for shameless self-promotion. 
His afternoon talk show is a different brand of journalism from that which he 
practiced on prime time for ABC. It's a different kind of audience too: The 
unemployed, housewives, youngsters. They are "the people," Rivera says. 
</P>
<P>
His people. 
</P>
<P>
The ones who stop him on the street in his native New York and cheer him on: 
</P>
<P>
"Go get 'em, Geraldo!" 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never be accepted by any kind of in-crowd," Rivera said. "This is my 
frustration. I can cover a war as good as anybody. I've demonstrated that. I 
can cover any kind of breaking-news situation as good as anybody. 
</P>
<P>
"But there's this snobbery that refuses to face the reality of that fact. I can 
do investigative reporting as good as anybody who's out there right now." 
</P>
<P>
Nobody is ever neutral about him and he knows it. He thrives on it. He plays to 
it. But there are thin spots in his thick skin. The "mean-spirited" shots he 
has taken from as varied a lineup of critics as The Times' Rosenberg to 
"Doonesbury" cartoonist Garry Trudeau genuinely hurt at times. 
</P>
<P>
"People want to be accepted by their peers," he says. "Even a rebel wants 
secretly to be accepted." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Rivera's assertion that he "picks up where Oprah and Donahue leave off" 
consistently proves to be all too tastelessly true in the view of most TV 
critics. 
</P>
<P>
Radio blurbs invite listeners to tune in while Rivera talks with women who 
dress their husbands up in panties, teddys and lace. Rarely does a week go by 
without mud wrestlers, prostitutes, pimps, serial killers or some other 
sensational social misfit making an appearance on his TV show. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like acceptance," he says, smiling without showing any teeth. "But I've 
come to the realization that it will never happen to me."

FOR PAKULA, IT'S FALLING IN LOVE WITH LOVE AND BEING IN LOVE; 
</P>
<P>
NEW FILM REFLECTS OPTIMISM ABOUT SECOND MARRIAGES

<P>
Love and action have always run a close race as the prime ingredients of the 
movies. The earliest artifacts of the form include both a famous flickering 
kiss and "The Great Train Robbery." Over the decades, scripts more often than 
not have been a mixture of the two: A little romance to top off the action, a 
little action to spell the romantically talking heads. 
</P>
<P>
Marital comedies flourished in the '30s, functioning as escapist fare in those 
Depression years because whatever problems the couples had they seldom involved 
a shortage of money. But films that contemplate and concentrate on the love of 
man and woman have grown surprisingly rare these days. The corruption of love 
in "Dangerous Liaisons" is about as close as any of the Oscar contenders come 
to being about marital love. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Pakula is on the verge of invading this underpopulated field with "See You 
in the Morning," a highly personal celebration of love the second time around. 
It will open in early April and is about a divorced man who marries a widow 
with children. Pakula, a then-divorced man, married a widow with children and 
has lived happily ever after, so the film is closely autobiographical in its 
inspiration although not, he says, in its specifics. 
</P>
<P>
On a late winter morning, Pakula sits in his suite of offices in midtown 
Manhattan, not far from the theater district. He is in preproduction on Scott 
Turow's best seller, "Presumed Innocent," on which Frank Pierson is doing the 
adaptation. "See You in the Morning" is finished and poised to go. It is the 
first original screenplay Pakula has both written and directed, and he awaits 
its fate with more than customary interest because its themes are so close to 
his heart. 
</P>
<P>
Pakula, just out of Yale in 1950, began his career as a production apprentice 
at MGM. He subsequently earned Academy Award nominations as the producer of "To 
Kill a Mockingbird," as a director for "All the President's Men" and as a 
screenwriter adapting "Sophie's Choice," which he also directed. His other 
credits as a director include "The Sterile Cuckoo" (his first effort); "Klute" 
(Jane Fonda as a hooker pursued by a killer), the powerful speculation on 
political conspiracy called "The Parallax View" (Warren Beatty as a reporter) 
and, most recently, "Orphans," with Albert Finney in the adaptation of a play. 
</P>
<P>
Pakula's wife, Hannah, whom he married 16 years ago, has published a scholarly 
and very well-reviewed biography of Queen Marie of Romania. She is now working 
on a biography of Queen Victoria's daughter, also named Victoria, who married 
Emperor Frederick of Prussia and after his death became known as Empress 
Frederick. 
</P>
<P>
Pakula's first wife was actress Hope Lange, herself now happily remarried, and 
they remain on friendly terms. "Couples don't necessarily kill each other, they 
just don't get along," Pakula says. 
</P>
<P>
"Marriages succeed or fail without those involved being good people or bad 
people. We probably all spend too much time trying to apportion blame. Much of 
it has to do with compatibilities you thought existed but didn't." 
</P>
<P>
In the film, Pakula's central figure is a psychiatrist, played by Jeff Bridges. 
Farrah Fawcett is the ex-wife, Alice Krige (memorable in "Chariots of Fire") is 
the widow he marries. Pakula rehearsed his cast for four weeks and regards it 
as an ensemble piece rather than a star vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about people who've had other lives and are now falling in love," Pakula 
says, "and about the difficulty in dealing with the lives we had before. It's 
about being able to break through your own defenses so you can fall in love 
again. It reflects my feelings about love -- romantic love -- and the family, 
and about my observation that at a certain age you better co-exist well or you 
won't survive. It also reflects my optimism, and I guess more than anything 
else it's an ode to falling in love and being in love. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't write about my own life directly, but, on the other hand, I 
couldn't have written it at all if I hadn't had comparable experiences." 
</P>
<P>
Not least, Pakula says with a grinning look at the ceiling, "Courtship brings 
out the outrageous in you. Your co-workers have every right to say you're out 
of your mind." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Pakula is an unusually reflective film maker who sees the industry and the 
medium with some detachment, an attitude probably symbolized by his living and 
working in New York rather than Hollywood and, at that, on the fringes of the 
film community in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
"The best of this business is the collaboration and the worst of this business 
is the collaboration," Pakula says. "The collaborative effort is so much a part 
of it that you have to keep reminding yourself who you are. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to keep a life for yourself outside of film. Hannah and I are just 
back from a long stay in Italy, where we drowned in art. We should all be 
required to take a year off and do something else." 
</P>
<P>
In his earlier days, Pakula says, the process of film making was fascinating 
and appealing for its own sake. No longer. "I have no interest in making films 
just for the process. It's not that exciting anymore." 
</P>
<P>
What matters -- although they always did, as a look at his credits confirms -- 
are content, characters and relationships. "Presumed Innocent" will be a 
return, as Pakula says, to the social and political tensions of "All the 
President's Men," with some of the sexual tensions from "Klute" as well. 
</P>
<P>
Pakula enjoys working with actors at their most creative and contributory. "At 
this point in my life it's not just a matter of working with wonderfully 
talented actors but working with them without tension, in a certain area of 
trust and relaxation where we get the best from each other. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't imbue an actor with passion and caring about family and children if 
it's not there to begin with," Pakula says. During the month's rehearsal on 
"See You in the Morning," "We were making families. Any film develops a sense 
of family before it's done, but it was even more so on this one. Jeff (Bridges) 
was wonderful at it; he's full of surprises. You can have interesting critical 
disagreements that come out of respect not contempt." 
</P>
<P>
Pakula, as is not invariably the case with directors, is fond of actors. He 
admires Farrah Fawcett's intense love of acting and her dedication, and he 
continues to go in awe of Meryl Streep, who was extraordinary as the Sophie of 
"Sophie's Choice." 
</P>
<P>
"The word genius is bandied about and I've only met a few, but Meryl has it. 
Critics resent it and patronize it, but she's not just an actress acting. She 
synthesizes the character. There's no ambivalence in her about the work. She 
plunges into it." 
</P>
<P>
It remains to be seen how well Pakula's private experience has translated into 
a fictional story. But it arrives as a valentine to a successful marriage that 
appears to be founded on mutual admiration and acquired wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd both been through things and that makes it easier to adjust," he says. 
"You don't take love for granted. You don't take anything for granted. I'm not 
the same pain in the neck I used to be -- I think, I hope. So much has to do 
with compatibility. It's easier when you know who you are -- as much as you 
ever do."

TERRENCE MCNALLY: THE PLAYWRIGHT AS SURVIVOR;

'YOU JUST WANT PEOPLE TO SEE YOUR WORK'

NEW YORK

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The other day Terrence McNally had to take part in "a book-signing thing" at 
the Drama Book Shop. When he saw all his plays laid out on the table, he 
realized that he had been in the theater for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than depress him, this struck him as an achievement. Terrence McNally 
likes the theater. He likes himself when he's working in it. He is glad that he 
managed to hang in there. 
</P>
<P>
McNally's new play, "Up in Saratoga" (opening Thursday at the Old Globe 
Theatre) is his 30th or so script. Some have been hits: "Next" (1969), "The 
Ritz" ('75), "Frankie and Johnny in the Claire de Lune" ('88). 
</P>
<P>
And some have been flops. There was McNally's very first play in 1965, "And 
Things That Go Bump in the Night." This ended with one of the characters being 
chased into an electric fence, a theme that several of the New York critics had 
fun with the next morning. "Two of them called for my death," McNally recalled 
the other day in his Village apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe this isn't a bad way for a playwright to be introduced to the theater. It 
certainly avoids false illusions. The trick, of course, is to survive the 
initiation. McNally did, thanks to his producer, Ted Mann. 
</P>
<P>
"We had come in under budget, so Ted decided to cut the ticket prices to $2 and 
$3 and keep the show open for two-and-a-half weeks. The reviews were so bad we 
didn't know if anyone would come, even at those prices. But we sold out every 
night and the show was wildly controversial. 
</P>
<P>
"So I had my two-and-a-half weeks of feeling like a playwright. There were 
people going bravo after the show. There were people who were moved by my 
writing. If Ted had closed the show in one day, I don't know if I could have 
lived with that. I don't know if I could have gone on being a playwright." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, McNally says, "I've had enormous ups and downs. There have been 
years when I've felt that I couldn't do it anymore, financially. But I've never 
lost my enthusiasm for the theater, and I've always been able to get my plays 
done, in some fashion." 
</P>
<P>
He never writes the same play twice. Many of them are funny; some tenderly so, 
like "Frankie and Johnny." But he has a dark, grotesque side, as in a new 
script, "The Lisbon Traviata." In another mood, he will tackle the book of 
musicals -- "The Rink" (a flop a few seasons back) or Harold Prince's planned 
new version of "Kiss of the Spider Woman." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a weird thing about my career. I do one thing and then I do something 
else. After 'The Ritz,' everybody expected me to write farce. After 'It's Only 
a Play," they expected me to write drawing-room comedies. Now with 'Frankie and 
Johnny" everybody expects me to write blue-collar romance. 
</P>
<P>
"You could argue that any writer's really just trying to write the same play 
over and over. First as a comedy; then as a musical; then as a tragedy. I don't 
know. I just think it's fun to work in all these forms. When I see a bare 
stage, I want to write for that." 
</P>
<P>
"Up in Saratoga" is another departure for McNally: a period piece. It's based 
on Bronson Howard's "Saratoga," a high-society costume drama from the 1870s. 
When Broadway producer Liz McCann gave it to McNally to read, with the thought 
that he might adapt it, he found it "You just want people to see your work." 
</P>
<P>
charming but creaky. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than simply adapt Howard's original, McNally has remodeled it into "a 
play by me, that I hope is respectful of the period; that I hope will make you 
believe that you're in the 19th Century for two and a half hours. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a lot of fun writing it. I liked creating a language where you can't use 
gutter talk or slang. Also, if you were going to give people a sense of the 
theater of that day, there had to be lots of subplots, a lot of loose ends to 
tie up. Plays with 25 people shouldn't be short. 
</P>
<P>
"Bronson Howard's name will always be on it, along with mine, but if it doesn't 
work, I'm afraid I'll have to take full responsibility. I'm optimistic, 
though." 
</P>
<P>
McNally approaches his trade like a craftsman. "I never think of myself as 
writing literature. I'm more like an architect who is creating a blueprint, on 
which people will put up something that will stand. They can have bathrooms and 
bedrooms and access from floor to floor. It's all very practical. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, writing the play is only 50% of the experience. You write that first 
draft by yourself. But 'Frankie and Johnny' isn't what's on the page, it's what 
will happen in the theater. So you need actors and a director. They inspire me. 
They delight me." 
</P>
<P>
The whole theater process delights him. McNally has written for the screen 
(he's adapting "Frankie and Johnny" for Paramount right now) but he's happiest 
while rehearsing a new show. "Theater is like -- a friend. Not a parent figure, 
but a friend. I think theater brings out the best in people. I know I'm a nicer 
guy when I'm in rehearsal. More trusting. More open. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, there's a horrible side of me that the theater also brings out. Like 
when I get a bad review, or when someone turns a play down. But when things are 
going well in rehearsal, with all the actors giving so much, I'm reminded of 
the nicest times in my life, back in high school -- before I got competitive 
with people." 
</P>
<P>
McNally went to high school in Corpus Christi, Tex., after which he came to New 
York to major in English at Columbia. In his senior year he wrote the Varsity 
Show, and that started his involvement with theater. 
</P>
<P>
The next step was a $40 a week gofer-ship with the Actors Studio, where he 
studied everybody from Geraldine Paige to Marilyn Monroe, and where he learned 
that he couldn't act -- perhaps the reason he has always admired actors so 
much. 
</P>
<P>
After 25 years, McNally remains young in his love for theater, catching every 
show at a late preview, so that he won't be corrupted by the critics, and up on 
all the gossip. He also knows more about opera than most music critics, as he 
regularly demonstrates on the Metropolitan Opera quiz. 
</P>
<P>
He's a New Yorker to the soul -- but disenchanted with the alienation he sees 
around him, the kids with their earphones, the adults buying their videos for 
another lonely Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankie and Johnny" was a reaction to that mood. McNally had been in India, 
where he found people actually paying attention to each other. He wanted to 
write a play showing that it could happen in Manhattan, too. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, that miracle. You think, I've had my two divorces or three bad 
relationships (he is unmarried), and I'm not gonna get involved again . . . and 
then this miracle happens. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it might be a play that would only interest people in their 40s and 
50s, but we got the college kids and the little old ladies, and they all 
responded to it. 
</P>
<P>
"No way will 'Lisbon Traviata' be as popular as 'Frankie and Johnny.' It's very 
violent. But we've had a little production of it in New York, and a lot of 
people liked it, and a lot of people had criticisms of it. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's all right. I mean, I don't love everything I write. Playwrights are 
aware of the flaws in their work. They just can't fix 'em. If they could, they 
would. You don't expect everything to run forever.

THARP AT THE PARIS OPERA: RULES WERE MADE TO BE BROKEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLEN ROBERTSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twyla Tharp has always been one of the dance world's wiliest chameleons, able 
to adapt to circumstances better than most mere mortals. 
</P>
<P>
Going transatlantic for the first time in her peripatetic career as a guest 
choreographer, she accepted an invitation from Rudolf Nureyev to stage a pair 
of works for the Paris Opera Ballet. One of them, "As Time Goes By," was 
created for the Joffrey Ballet back in 1973, just after Tharp turned the ballet 
establishment on its head with "Deuce Coupe." The other, "The Rules of the 
Game," was a world premiere. 
</P>
<P>
Paris saw both these works for the first time Feb. 18, as part of a bill 
showcasing the avant-garde in ballet over half a century. The program opened 
with a reconstruction by former ballerina Tatiana Leskova of "Les Presages" 
(1933), Leonide Massine's first symphonic ballet. Next came "Agon," George 
Balanchine's great Stravinsky collaboration of 1957. Then it was Tharp's turn, 
first with her Joffrey piece, staged by her longtime cohort Richard Colton, a 
member of the original cast. 
</P>
<P>
The evening closed with "Rules of the Game," a title that punned both on the 
official ballet lexicon and Jean Renoir's French film classic. But the title 
wasn't the only thing that let us know Tharp was intent on evoking a Gallic 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
The curtain of the Paris Opera Ballet's home is an elaborate trompe l'oeil 
affair of red and gold draperies painted to hang in seemingly luxurious rococo 
swags. When this curtain rose for "Rules," it revealed another one designed by 
Giles Dufour: a replica that seemed to be reflected in a fractured mirror that 
someone (Tharp, or one of the dancers) had just shattered by hurtling the rule 
book right at it. 
</P>
<P>
The music too showed an on-going concern with melding past and present. It had 
a Bach violin sonata at its center, surrounded by elaborate full-orchestra 
variations that combined modern sounds with classic forms just as Stravinsky 
did in "Agon." 
</P>
<P>
A plotless suite of dances for four soloists and a back-up corps of four men 
and four women, "Rules of the Game" showcased the individual talents of the 
cast -- exactly the kind of ballet that French dancers like to do best. No 
other company in the world is so prone to "Look, Ma, I'm dancing" narcissism 
and Tharp seized on this penchant by introducing the cast one by one in a 
parade of solos that crossed the stage like some grand processional. 
</P>
<P>
Dufour's tutus -- the mid-thigh, droopy-skirted kind, red with an overlay of 
black net -- evoked Degas' ballerinas. Yet Tharp's dancers weren't the Romantic 
waifs that modern eyes see in pretty Impressionist paintings. Instead, she went 
after the gritty, hard-working way Degas' danseuses stood around, arms akimbo 
with one hip thrust forward. Tharp didn't stress this tart imagery, but she did 
treat her dancers as real women with an obvious sexuality that never reduced 
them to either Snow Whites or Lady Macbeths. 
</P>
<P>
The Paris Opera Ballet was far from Tharp's only reference point. In addition 
to Balanchine, she made several nods to Jerome Robbins. But, as with so much of 
Tharp, pinpointing her sources was only a bonus, not something needed to 
understand what was zipping past.

The opening night audience was ecstatic, rhythmically slow-clapping Tharp and 
cast through a long series of curtain calls. 
</P>
<P>
And what French event could ever be complete without a soupcon of la scandale 
running underneath: Nureyev's protegee, Sylvie Guillem, was nowhere to be seen, 
although she was originally meant to be appearing in "Rules of the Game." 
Everyone kept officially mum, but rumors were rampant that this etoile with an 
extension as high as the Eiffel Tower was debating whether to sever, or at the 
very least drastically re-structure, her allegiance to the company. 
</P>
<P>
The news came a few days later: Guillem had joined the Royal Ballet, Covent 
Garden, as principal guest artist. Too bad it had to happen at this moment. 
Tharp's stringency is just what Guillem needed to give her glamorous game a 
whole new set of rules.

HOW TWO WHITE GUYS HIT IT BIG IN RAP; 
</P>
<P>
WITH $3,000 AND 'WILD THING,' DELICIOUS VINYL STUNNED RECORD INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
"What a dump, man," scoffed Matt Dike, surveying the tiny, cluttered Hollywood 
office of the independent label Delicious Vinyl Records. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to tell what's debris and what's not," said his partner Mike Ross, 
pushing some papers off a chair so he could sit down. 
</P>
<P>
"Who cares?," said Dike, 27, plopping down on a chair and putting his feet on 
the desk. "It's funky -- it's home." 
</P>
<P>
Lanky and long-haired, wearing rumpled, mismatched clothes, Dike had that 
walking-disaster-area look of a '60s hippie. Ross, 26, dressed 
Saturday-afternoon casual, was eager for the interview to be over so he could 
go play basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Who would figure that these two disheveled novices would be responsible for the 
biggest-selling single since "We Are the World" in 1985: Tone Loc's "Wild 
Thing"? 
</P>
<P>
If that's not unlikely enough, there is the added surprise that Ross and Dike 
are white players in a game usually identified with black music and tied to the 
ghetto experience. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, we're happening, dude," said Dike, doodling on a piece of scrap paper. 
"We're just two soulful white guys, hanging out, being cool." 
</P>
<P>
Soon, they may be a couple of rich, soulful white guys. Their little label, 
which has only five artists, has only released a handful of singles and one 
album -- by Tone Loc. 
</P>
<P>
Tone Loc's new single, "Funky Cold Medina," is off to a fast start and has 
definite Top 10 potential. The L.A. rapper's album, "Loc-ed After Dark," was 
just released, but is already in the national pop Top 20. (See Record Rack, 
Page 84) 
</P>
<P>
At first, Dike and Ross said putting together the 2-million-selling single, 
"Wild Thing," was no real feat. It cost less than $3,000 -- dirt cheap these 
days. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't call it novel or different," said Ross. "We used stuff that other 
people have used. Matt came up with the beat and the guitar groove. It's simple 
and nothing new." 
</P>
<P>
But something about it is turning on all those fans. 
</P>
<P>
"That good, kickin' dance beat is one of the things that makes it work," Ross 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Another is the amusingly risque lyrics, mostly written by Young MC, one of the 
other rappers on the label. 
</P>
<P>
"Tone came up with lyrics too," Dike said with a laugh. "They were ridiculous. 
He wrote this X-rated thing. It was a mess. It was a one-joke thing. It's like 
it was written in a drunken stupor. The only thing right about it was the 
spirit. We had to go with what Young MC wrote." 
</P>
<P>
Ross added, "We wanted the song to be tongue-in-cheek and risque -- as risque 
as we could get away with and still get air play. The concept of the song was 
these funny scenarios of this guy trying to do the wild thing." 
</P>
<P>
Dike was first struck by the phrase wild thing -- street slang for sex -- in 
Spike Lee's 1986 comedy "She's Gotta Have It." 
</P>
<P>
"A friend of mine -- Fab Five Freddie -- said it in the movie," Dike said. "At 
one point we had it in mind for him to do the record. That's when we were 
having problems with Tone and things were up in the air for a while." 
</P>
<P>
One problem was that Ross and Dike wanted the record at a slow speed, while Loc 
insisted on rapping fast. "It took a lot of coaxing to get him to do it slow," 
Ross said. "It's not the style he likes. But we knew that style is well suited 
to his voice, which is very deep. With a half-speed rap, the record sounds 
sexier." 
</P>
<P>
Added Dike, "That half-speed rap fits the song. Anyway, Tone doesn't sound good 
when he raps fast. He slurs his words. He sounds like he's eating chili dogs or 
something." 
</P>
<P>
It's often been said that the rap-music world is like the rock scene back in 
the '50s -- a maze of tiny, under-financed independent labels putting out 
records that were sold from the trunks of cars. With a little capital and a 
good idea, you could be a record-company mogul overnight. In rap, you still 
can. 
</P>
<P>
The field is full of little companies like Delicious Vinyl, operated by young 
entrepreneurs who have a good music sense and are learning the business as they 
go along. 
</P>
<P>
"Do we look like moguls?" Ross asked, looking over at Dike, who was cracking up 
at the thought of being confused with the kind of dapper, high-powered 
businessmen who run the record industry. "We're just guys who like rap who saw 
other small companies starting up. We figured we could do it too." 
</P>
<P>
Of the label's five rap artists, only Tone Loc and Def Jef have relased 
records. But more product is due soon. They said Body-n-Soul, a female group, 
will have a single out this month. The other artists are Young MC and G-Love-E. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dike and Ross, they get along well -- for the most part -- with 
the artists. Is there any of the friction you might expect in a situation where 
two whites are working with young blacks -- some who undoubtedly were raised to 
resent whites? 
</P>
<P>
Dike said that, in some cases, there was a racial barrier initially. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to get past negative feelings and distrust at first with some people," 
he said. "Once they trust you and see you're not out to rip them off, things 
are cool. Anyway, they get over any racial barriers real quick because it's to 
their advantage. They want what we have to offer. It's surprising how a chance 
to make money can overcome prejudice real fast." 
</P>
<P>
Originally from upstate New York, the self-described hustler Dike is a disco 
fan who was turned onto rap by one of the music's pioneers, Grandmaster Flash. 
"I was hanging out with Flash in New York," he said. "I got established in New 
York as a club deejay before I came to L.A." 
</P>
<P>
He met Ross, a Long Beach native, in 1984, when both were deejaying local 
parties and clubs. Their friendship developed when they were part of the same 
deejay record pool -- a place to pick up promo copies of the latest dance 
records. "We were the only white guys in the pool," Dike said. "We used to go 
down there together. It was a rough neighborhood (the Crenshaw District). Two 
guys together were less likely to get beat up." 
</P>
<P>
Dike and Ross eventually decided they could make rap records as good as most on 
the market. "These small rap companies put out a lot of product -- most of it 
bad," said Ross. "But then one record hits and they're making money. It didn't 
take much to get started. So why not give it a shot?" 
</P>
<P>
They started Delicious Vinyl with a $5,000 loan obtained by Ross. Dike had a 
little studio in his house and some technical savvy, while Ross, who interned 
at MCA Records while going to UCLA, knew something about the inner workings of 
the industry. 
</P>
<P>
"We floated along on little money, scraping by," Dike recalled. "We put a lot 
of money into pressing our first record (Tone Loc's 'On Fire'), which got some 
local attention. But then we ran out of money. We had to make some kind of a 
distribution deal with a big company to get records on the market." 
</P>
<P>
After working briefly with Fantasy Records, they signed a distribution deal 
with Island Records, home over the years to such diverse attractions as Bob 
Marley, Traffic, U2 and Grace Jones. 
</P>
<P>
"The big companies out there are looking for little labels like ours," Ross 
said. "We're close to the streets and the rap world. Those record-company guys 
sit in their luxurious offices and don't have a clue about rap. They need us. 
They see there's a lot of money to be made in rap." 
</P>
<P>
The small size of their label, Ross noted, is its biggest asset. "We don't have 
to answer to all these department heads. We know what we like and we just do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
How big will their company get? 
</P>
<P>
"Not too big," Dike said. "I like this funky little office. I like things 
casual. I don't want to be one of those stuck-up corporate dudes. I want to 
stay close to the streets. I want to hang out with real people."

ON THE OFFBEAT: NON-GUITAR POP TOOTS ITS OWN HORN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Western pop, particularly rock 'n' roll, is so fixated on the guitar as the 
instrument that you might think that no other instrument exists . . . like, for 
instance, horns. 
</P>
<P>
It was honking saxophones (and pumping pianos) that fueled rock before Chuck 
Berry and then the British Invasion made six-string axeslingers the music's 
prime movers. And consider the jazz realm, where trumpeters Louis Armstrong and 
Miles Davis and saxophonists Charlie Parker, John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman 
played prominent roles in shaping the music. 
</P>
<P>
World music has its pockets of guitar domination -- particularly in African pop 
-- but this edition of "On the Off Beat," a periodic look at roots, ethnic and 
non-mainstream music from around the world, focuses on the new directions and 
old twists of horn players from the progressive (Steve Coleman) to the 
traditional (the Master Musicians of Jajouka). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STEVE COLEMAN &amp; FIVE ELEMENTS. 
</P>
<P>
"Sine Die." Pangea. 
</P>
<P>
Just what the world needs: another crop of young jazz players trying to use 
contemporary funk rhythms, Third World elements and high technology as a 
springboard for serious improvisation. Alto saxophonist Coleman is the de facto 
leader of a set of young, Brooklyn-based musicians attempting just that, and he 
may be on to something with "Sine Die." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Cassandra Wilson's jazzy vocals (especially on "Destination") nor 
Coleman's darting, acidic solos ("Cinema Saga") sound forced or restricted by 
the rhythmic underpinning. The rhythm section isn't likely to tear the roof off 
any heavy-duty funk emporium, but it doesn't approach the funk as some alien 
life form, either. Maybe Coleman and company will ultimately dead-end in 
another tired fusion formula, but right now it sounds more like an adventurous 
new direction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PAULO MOURA. 
</P>
<P>
"Gafieira Etc &amp; Tal" Braziloid. 
</P>
<P>
Like Coleman, Moura favors a mix-and-match aesthetic, but it isn't easy to get 
a grip on the Brazilian reed player on this album. If "Dialogo" and "Rio Negro" 
sound like a Brazilian Weather Report with Moura in the Wayne Shorter role, 
then "Ao Velho Pedro" and "Alma Brasileira" throw things for a loop with banjo 
and trombone and a feel closer to New Orleans trad jazz. Moura also exercises 
his swing clarinet chops and solos effectively over a rock-steady backbeat, so 
who cares if you can't pin him down? The compositions are intricate yet 
uncluttered, the performances economical but expressive, and the variety 
stimulating. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
VARIOUS ARTISTS. 
</P>
<P>
"Music Is My Occupation." Trojan (British import). 
</P>
<P>
This collection of instrumentals from 1962-65, part of a series of reissues of 
early Jamaican classics, features solo singles by members of the studio band 
that defined the formative stages of ska. The island's best musicians, 
including trombonist Don Drummond, created from scratch the fundamental 
building blocks of Jamaican music from indigenous styles, New Orleans R&amp;B 
and the horn sound of Blue Note jazz groups. 
</P>
<P>
Saxophonist Tommy McCook's "Magic," "Strolling In" and "Yard Broom" evidence 
the New Orleans connection -- imagine Frankie Ford's "Sea Cruise" crossed with 
a high-steppin' Mardi Gras parade and seasoned with a dash of Jamaican 
allspice. Trumpeter Baba Brooks' "Vitamin A" and Drummond's "Green Island" 
sound like prototypes for the late-'70s British Two-Tone bands like the 
Specials and Madness. But the long guitar melody winding beneath the punchy 
horn lines on McCook's "Apanga" is something else again -- a fresh departure 
foreshadowing the way this music, so progressive for its time, became the 
cornerstone of a new tradition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BROTHER VERNARD JOHNSON. 
</P>
<P>
"Rocking the Gospel." ROIR cassette. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson is a Texas-based gospel saxophonist with a wild 'n' woolly vibrato 
reminiscent of jazzman Arthur Blythe and licks from the King Curtis/Junior 
Walker R&amp;B school. This set, recorded live at a Fresno church with vocal 
support from a choir, doesn't quite hit the incendiary heights the liner notes 
promise. However, the opening side does rock out smartly, particularly when 
Johnson's passionate playing on "I Must Tell Jesus" and "Lord Life Us Up Where 
We Belong" ignites the congregation. But interest wanes on the second side as 
the novelty of hearing a saxophone ripping through gospel material wears off. 
Available from Reachout International Records, Suite 725, 611 Broadway, New 
York, N.Y., 10012. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE MASTER MUSICIANS OF JAJOUKA. 
</P>
<P>
"The Master Musicians of Jajouka." Adelphi. 
</P>
<P>
The Jajouka musicians make devotional music of a different sort, and they have 
lured artists ranging from writer William Burroughs to the late Brian Jones of 
the Rolling Stones and jazz pioneer Ornette Coleman to Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
Recorded in 1972, this album is more in the nature of a field recording than 
Jones' celebrated (and rare) album of music from Jajouka, but there are moments 
of startling power. The short selections are performed on the rhaita, flutes 
and a string instrument called the gimbri, with drum accompaniment. The most 
potent tracks feature the rhaita -- a high-pitched, reedy foghorn with a 
nagging, deranged tone that grips you and just won't let go. 
</P>
<P>
Check the finales to "Boujeloud" and "Jajouka Black Eyes," where one rhaita 
locks into an insistent drone while a second weaves hypnotic patterns around it 
and the drums pound away underneath. There isn't any other music in the world 
like it.

YOUR TAXES; 
</P>
<P>
IT CAME FROM WASHINGTON; 
</P>
<P>
THERE'S A HUGE BUDGET WAITING TO BE FED. BUSH SAYS 'NO NEW TAXES.' THIS TOWN 
MAY NOT BE BIG ENOUGH FOR BOTH OF THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, Times Staff Writer

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Can George Bush keep his emphatic "read my lips" promise to protect the 
American people from new taxes? 
</P>
<P>
The answer, so typical of the muddles that come out of Washington, is both yes 
and no. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the President and Congress probably will avoid any raise in the tax rates 
for individuals and businesses embodied in the 1986 reform act. 
</P>
<P>
But no, he can't redeem the campaign pledge entirely because of the big federal 
budget deficit. After a fierce debate, there may well be an increase in some 
excise charges such as the federal tax on gasoline or the levies on cigarettes 
and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Since these taxes would be extended -- rather than inaugurated -- Bush would be 
able to claim that he has remained faithful to the campaign pledge of "no new 
taxes." 
</P>
<P>
Because taxes are such a delicate issue, the political maneuvering has just 
begun, as the Republican President and Democratic Congress circle each other 
warily. 
</P>
<P>
"We're certainly not going to bring up taxes," said Budget Director Richard 
Darman. "The President has made his position extremely clear. If the other side 
wishes to bring up taxes, we'll have to discuss it on the merits. But our 
position is that the merits don't require taxes." 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats, badly burned by the tax issue in two losing presidential 
campaigns, talk in general terms about revenues, but they want the White House 
to make the first move. Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), chairman of the 
tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, put it bluntly: "I don't want to go to 
the bargaining table . . . and be the one that brings taxes to the table." 
Instead, he wants an invitation and admission from the White House that 
"everything" is subject to negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The President so far has proposed a tax increase that hits a comparatively 
small group in the population, the state and local employees who currently do 
not pay the Medicare payroll tax, which is 1.45% of incomes up to $48,000. This 
idea has been proposed before and defeated after energetic lobbying by union 
groups. The tax would apply to 2 million workers. 
</P>
<P>
By far the most controversial tax issue is the President's call for a cut in 
the capital gains rate, the tax on stocks, bonds, land and other assets that 
are not depreciated. 
</P>
<P>
He wants to trim the top tax rate for capital gains to 15% from the current 28% 
rate. Taxpayers would enjoy the lower rate on the sale of assets held more than 
a year, if they are sold from 1989 through 1992. The holding period would 
increase to two years for assets sold in 1993 and 1994, and three years for 
investments sold in 1995 or later. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was dead on arrival at the House Ways and Means Committee, which 
writes tax bills. "The committee continues to insist that no fundamental change 
should be made to the Tax Reform Act of 1986," chairman Rostenkowski said on 
Feb. 23, setting forth the official Ways and Means policy. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats denounce the proposal for a lower capital gains rate as a sop to the 
rich. "Reducing tax rates for the wealthiest 2% of the nation is not going to 
generate the type of revenue the President is envisioning," said Rep. Robert T. 
Matsui (D-Sacramento), a member of the Ways and Means Committee. "I am 
concerned he is raising expectations too high." 
</P>
<P>
About 70% of capital gains in 1987 went to about 1 million taxpayers with 
incomes above $100,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
But the President is anxious to redeem one of his campaign promises -- to cut 
the capital gains levy as a boost to economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, you can cast the capital gains cut as a cut for the higher brackets," 
said White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu, "but the fact of the matter is 
that its purpose and its historic record is that it does create investment, 
investment creates jobs and jobs create opportunities for men and women that 
want to work and earn a living." 
</P>
<P>
To deflect the charge that only the wealthy would benefit, the Administration 
wants to eliminate the tax on capital gains for single persons with adjusted 
gross incomes below $10,000 a year and couples with incomes below $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
However, the capital gains proposal seems doomed because powerful members of 
Congress see it as a threat to unravel the carefully crafted tapestry of the 
1986 tax reform legislation. "I like stability in the (tax) code; I think 
that's what the American people expected," said Rostenkowski, who regards his 
role in the legislation as the major accomplishment, thus far, of a 30-year 
congressional career. "I'd like very much to see the '86 code untouched for 
several years. This is the first year where we will see the true effects of the 
1986 tax cut." 
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski said he is worried by the Pandora's box of changes that could be 
opened. If Congress considers a lower capital gains tax, perhaps it will become 
entangled in other issues. Or there might be a new debate about enlarging the 
Individual Retirement Act, which was restricted. These uncertainties "are the 
things that frighten me," said the canny Ways and Means chairman. 
</P>
<P>
And he delivered an unmistakable warning to the White House that forcing the 
capital gains issue could bring with it something the President is dead set 
against -- higher rates. 
</P>
<P>
"If the President is going to insist on the capital gains reduction to 15%, I 
see no way we could hold back the majority of the House from increasing the top 
marginal rate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski wants more tax revenues without tinkering with capital gains or 
the top rates. "I should imagine we can go to a gasoline tax, to the sin taxes, 
to excise taxes of a sort," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another important Democrat, Rep. Leon Panetta (D-Monterey), chairman of the 
House Budget Committee, agrees on the need for increased tax revenues, combined 
with a "balance of spending constraints on defense and entitlements." Panetta 
said he is willing to "look at some form of energy tax" to raise revenues. 
</P>
<P>
The White House has no enthusiasm for gasoline taxes, which would cut energy 
consumption, hurting an already depressed industry. Rather than raise the tax 
burden, the Administration wants to spur energy exploration with some new tax 
credits for the independent entrepreneurs who drill for oil and gas. Tax and 
investment credits would help the drillers while costing the Treasury about 
$350 million a year in forgone tax collections. 
</P>
<P>
Other beneficiaries of Bush tax breaks would include low-income families 
needing help to pay for child care, people who adopt children, and 
high-technology companies with big research budgets. 
</P>
<P>
A new tax break is designed to help 2.5 million low-income working families. A 
tax credit, up to $1,000 for each child under the age of 4, would be provided 
for families with at least one working parent. The credit would be available 
for households with incomes up to $13,000 in 1990, with the ceiling rising to 
$20,000 by 1994. 
</P>
<P>
If the family's tax credit is more than its tax liability, the family would 
receive the cash difference from the government. 
</P>
<P>
Some action on the credit is very likely during this session of Congress 
because both Democrats and Republicans promised child-care legislation during 
the presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Another candidate for easy congressional approval is the President's request 
for a deduction for as much as $3,000 in expenses connected with the adoption 
of a child with "special needs," including physical handicaps. The deduction 
would cover expenses such as social services, legal fees and transportation 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
The research and development tax credit, designed to help high-technology 
companies, is scheduled to expire at year's end. Bush wants to renew it, at a 
cost of $400 million in lost tax revenues. The persuasive influence of the 
computer, electronics and semiconductor industries, which have strong friends 
in both political parties, gives this proposal a good chance for enactment by 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of an "enterprise zones" proposal, which would offer businesses about 
$1 billion in tax credits for establishing factories and facilities in 
economically depressed areas, will depend on the salesmanship of former Rep. 
Jack Kemp, the new secretary of Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
Worried about the corporations disappearing under a wave of leveraged buyouts, 
Congress will be gingerly discussing various proposals to ease the tax burden 
on dividends. 
</P>
<P>
Today's tax code makes takeovers financed with debt easy because interest 
payments on the huge borrowings are deductible. Dividends, by contrast, are 
twice taxed, as profits to the corporation and then as income to the individual 
receiving the dividend. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, it's not a "simple black-or-white situation" to discourage 
buyouts through the tax code, said Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan 
Greenspan. Clever lawyers would soon find ways to circumvent any restrictions 
on interest deductions, he said. And it costs too much to stop the double 
taxing of dividends -- the revenue loss would be $20 billion to $25 billion a 
year, Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
Some minor changes in the treatment of corporate interest charges and dividends 
are possible, but a wary Congress won't risk any big loss of tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and the Democratic majorities in the House and Senate seem headed for a 
clash on taxes. His budget says all of the new tax credits and benefits, 
costing $4.8 billion, will be paid for by a surge of revenues from cutting 
capital gains levies. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats want some other route to raise revenues and help reduce the budget 
deficit. "I don't know whether we're going to increase taxes," Rostenkowski 
said. "I know you can't increase them without the President of the United 
States."

<P>
If you're unhappy at the prospect of paying your federal taxes this year, it 
probably won't give you much comfort to hear about the sweet deal the wealthy 
Sullivans of Boston will be getting. 
</P>
<P>
Congress gave William H. Sullivan Jr., eldest son Charles W., and other family 
members a special tax break on their sale of the New England Patriots football 
team, which they completed last October. The Sullivans were the first owners of 
the franchise but in recent years had piled up more than $50 million in debts 
on the team and other enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, they had been talking to some 20 potential buyers about the team 
but had failed to nail down a deal, causing some anxiety that their financial 
problems might disrupt the Patriots' activities. 
</P>
<P>
To the rescue came Congress, by writing into the tax code a special provision 
allowing the Sullivans' company to write off those accumulated losses if they 
reached a deal. Exactly which congressmen pushed for the break is veiled in 
obscurity -- as is often the case -- but the intent was evidently to give the 
family an extra incentive to turn the Patriots over to a more financially 
stable owner. 
</P>
<P>
The loophole is expected to mean millions of dollars for the family, which sold 
the team to Victor Kiam, chairman of the Remington shaver company, for $85 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The Sullivans' special deal is one of the loopholes that continues to make some 
taxpayers more equal than others under the "reformed" federal tax code, though 
hundreds of other breaks were eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Some were written in to see that corporations and individuals didn't suffer 
unfairly when Congress changed the rules of the game in 1986. Others provide 
special benefits for broader groups of taxpayers -- and often, despite their 
patent unfairness, enjoy wide popular support. 
</P>
<P>
Two other individuals who got special deals under the so-called transitional 
tax rules were Kansas oil billionaires Charles and David Koch, owners of the 
private Koch Industries conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
The tax code writers allowed the brothers' company to use accelerated 
depreciation and an investment tax credit for their planned expansion of a big 
Minneapolis oil refinery, though such benefits were curtailed for most other 
businesses in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Congress took the view that the break was fair, because the company had begun 
the expansion believing that the old tax rules would not change. 
</P>
<P>
Also a beneficiary was Texas Air Corp., owner of Continental, Eastern and 
People Express air carriers. Congress said Texas Air could continue to reduce 
its taxes by applying losses Eastern racked up before it was purchased by Texas 
Air. 
</P>
<P>
The tax code writers decided that this was fair because the company had bought 
the struggling line expecting to be able to use the so-called tax loss 
carryforward. They estimated the value of the writeoff at $47 million. 
</P>
<P>
As Congress wrote these special deals into the new code, it preserved other 
quirks from the old code that benefit those clever enough to know how to use 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The code's rules on inheritance continue to allow many well-off people to pass 
on much of their riches free of taxation from one generation to the next. 
</P>
<P>
The break comes in rules that have to do with the way inherited property is 
valued. The rules say that, for tax purposes, the value of the property to the 
new owner is fixed at the time it is inherited, rather than at the time the 
former owner acquired it. 
</P>
<P>
Consider an example. A father wants to pass on a block of stock that he bought 
for $10,000 20 years ago and is now worth $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
If the son inherited it at the $10,000 value, he would be required to pay taxes 
on a $90,000 profit if he sold it. But since it is valued at $100,000, he can 
sell it and pay no tax on it, said Sidney Kess, a tax accountant with Peat 
Marwick Main &amp; Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, this looks like a loophole, plain and simple," Kess said. 
</P>
<P>
The father's estate will pay tax on the stock, but only if the value of the 
estate exceeds $600,000. Only a small percentage of estates are worth more than 
that amount, said Kess, who also noted that any asset passed on to a spouse 
escapes all taxation. 
</P>
<P>
Congress repealed and quickly reinstated this law in the late 1970s, after 
howls of protest. Now legislators are considering dumping it again. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent report, the Congressional Budget Office wrote that plugging this 
hole could "reduce opportunities for wealthy families to avoid tax permanently 
on an important source of income." 
</P>
<P>
Another dodge, the so-called tax-free exchange, has helped make many wealthy 
real estate people lots richer. 
</P>
<P>
This rule allows the individual or corporate owner of a piece of real estate to 
swap it for any equivalently valued property without paying tax on the 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
An investor might buy a run-down building for $50,000, fix it up and swap it 
for a building valued at $100,000. The investor might continue to add value to 
his portfolio of properties with similar tax-free transactions. 
</P>
<P>
By "trading up" in such a way, the investor avoids taxes he'd pay if he sold 
one property to raise money to buy another. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the beauty of these deals is that the tax rules are "very liberal in 
what you can swap," Kess said. "You can swap not only buildings for buildings, 
but for business or farm equipment." 
</P>
<P>
But if such less known rules of the code can be unfair, so can the provisions 
that are well known and have great popular support. 
</P>
<P>
The home equity loan, one of the code's most sacred cows, "raises a whole host 
of equity questions," says Joseph Minarik, a tax expert at the Joint Economic 
Committee of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
For instance: The taxpayer who finances his car through an auto company now can 
now deduct only 20% of the interest, a figure that falls to zero in 1991. But 
if he takes a home equity loan to finance his auto purchase, he can deduct the 
full amount. 
</P>
<P>
Tax purists also still frown over the airlines' "frequent flyer" programs, 
which they say allow companies to pass benefits to employees -- mostly 
high-ranking employees -- free of tax. These days, the airlines might be just 
as happy to see the authorities start taxing the programs, because it might 
discourage use of the program and cut the airlines' expensive obligations. 
</P>
<P>
But it appears that the programs' status will remain unchanged, since the 
Internal Revenue Service feels enforcement would be simply too big a job, said 
Eliot Rosen, editor of the nonprofit tax publication Tax Notes in Washington. 
"Here's an example of a benefit people are getting without a special 
congressional action," he said.

Dreading the annual hassle of tackling taxes? 
</P>
<P>
For many taxpayers, there is good news about 1988 taxes: They represent the 
lowest rates in more than 40 years. Tax returns for the year will reflect, for 
the first time, the full benefits of the new tax rates mandated by the Tax 
Reform Act of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
That means a 15% rate for four out of every five taxpayers, who use the simple 
tax forms and can take advantage of 1988's higher standard deductions and 
personal exemptions. High-income individuals face a maximum effective rate of 
28%, but that is down from 38.5% a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
But, despite the lower rates, some taxpayers may find themselves actually 
paying more in taxes than in years past. The downside of tax reform is the 
sharp cutbacks in deductions on interest paid on consumer debt. In another 
change, long-term capital gains are now counted as ordinary income and could be 
taxed at a higher rate than previously. 
</P>
<P>
"The amount of taxes that taxpayers will pay in 1988, in many instances, will 
be higher than before the 1986 tax act, even though the tax rates are lower," 
explained Mark S. Granich, tax partner at the Long Beach office of Deloitte 
Haskins &amp; Sells. "The reason is they are losing more in deductions than 
they are gaining in tax rate reductions." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, high-income taxpayers may be subject to the more restrictive and 
costly alternative minimum tax. Others who began receiving substantial 
retirement benefits in 1988 will have to make major decisions this year on 
receiving payouts from these nest eggs. 
</P>
<P>
In figuring 1988 taxes, be aware of these major changes that determine how you 
compute your taxes: 
</P>
<P>
Tax rates: The basic rate structure in 1988 is three-tiered, compared to five 
in 1987 (see chart on page 10). For example, a married couple filing jointly 
pays a 15% marginal rate on taxable income of up to $29,750. The rate rises to 
28% on income between $29,750 and $71,900. It increases again to 33% on taxable 
earnings between $71,900 to $149,250. 
</P>
<P>
Confused? Remember that your effective tax rate is not the same as the marginal 
rates indicated by the three tax brackets of 15%, 28% and 33%. To calculate 
your effective tax rate -- the actual percentage that you pay -- divide your 
total taxes by your taxable income. 
</P>
<P>
"The net result is that income from dollar 1 to 149,250 is at a flat 28%," 
explained Robert Gowing, tax partner in charge of the Los Angeles office of 
Touche Ross. 
</P>
<P>
Personal Exemptions: $1,950 each for taxpayer, spouse and each dependent, up 
from $1,900 in 1987. However, for high-income taxpayers the benefits of these 
exemptions are eliminated because of a 5% surcharge if taxable income exceeds 
$149,250 for joint returns, $123,790 for heads of households, $89,560 for 
single individuals and $113,300 for married individuals filing separately. 
</P>
<P>
Standard Deductions: "Those taxpayers who don't have a lot of itemized 
deductions will benefit from the higher standard deductions in 1988 versus 
1987," Granich said. 
</P>
<P>
The deductions for 1988 are: $2,500 for each spouse of a married couple filing 
separately, $3,000 for single taxpayers, $4,400 for heads of households and 
$5,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly. Single taxpayers 65 years or older 
can take an additional standard deduction of $750. For married taxpayers 65 or 
older the deduction is $600 each. 
</P>
<P>
Itemized (Schedule A) Deductions: An alternative to using the simple standard 
deductions is to use itemized individual deductions allowed by the IRS. Among 
the changes in 1988 requirements are: 
</P>
<P>
* Personal interest paid on consumer loans, such as credit cards and car loans, 
is now only 40% deductible, down from 65% in 1987. The deduction will drop to 
20% in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
* The deduction for mileage is 24 cents a mile in 1988, up from 22.5 cents the 
year before. 
</P>
<P>
* State and local income taxes, real estate and certain personal property taxes 
are deductible, but sales taxes have not been deductible since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
* Trade or business interest is fully deductible. 
</P>
<P>
* Deductions for medical and dental expenses, personal casualty and theft 
losses, charitable gifts and miscellaneous items remain unchanged at 1987 
levels, when they were dramatically cut back. Deductions for investment 
interest and passive activities interest are also unchanged. There also have 
been no changes in children's taxes, estate taxes or individual retirement 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
* Under a 1987 change in the Tax Reform Act, interest deductions on mortgages 
or loans secured by personal residences are now limited to loans of $1 million 
on first and second homes. Gowing explained, "For people who already had 
mortgages (of more than $1 million) in place before Oct. 13, 1987, the interest 
on the full amount is still deductible." Interest on any mortgage after that 
date is subject to the new rule. "It is the government's insidious attempt to 
chip away and broaden the (tax) base and to get at the wealthy taxpayers," he 
said. Under the new rules, interest is deductible on home equity loans of up to 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Alternative Minimum Tax: The alternative minimum tax was created so high-income 
taxpayers did not escape paying their share of taxes by taking unfair advantage 
of the new laws. 
</P>
<P>
The alternative minimum tax calculation starts with federal taxable income but 
eliminates certain deductions that are allowed for conventional tax 
calculation. The major disallowances are state income taxes and real estate 
taxes, passive losses from limited partnerships and rental real estate 
activities, deductions for interest paid on consumer debt and miscellaneous 
itemized deductions. 
</P>
<P>
Although the alternative minimum tax rate of 21% is lower than the regular rate 
of 28%, eliminating the deductions can make the alternative minimum taxable 
income so much higher that effective tax cost is higher. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to find many more players subject to the minimum tax," said 
George H. McCrimlisk, tax partner at the downtown office of KPMG Peat Marwick. 
</P>
<P>
Grandfather Election: Taxpayers, who as of Aug. 1, 1986, had accrued benefits 
in all of the qualified retirement plans -- corporate, individual retirement 
accounts, Keoghs and tax sheltered annuities -- of more than $562,500 face a 
major decision on taking the so-called "grandfather election." 
</P>
<P>
Under the tax reform act, any accrued benefits over that amount are subject to 
a 15% excise tax upon distribution. A taxpayer, however, may avoid the excise 
tax if he or she elects to roll over those benefits into an IRA and draw on 
them subject to an annual limitation defined by the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
Miscellaneous Changes: The IRS no longer grants automatic filing extensions if 
a person is temporarily out of the country when taxes are due. This year's 
deadline is April 17 because the normal April 15 date falls on a Saturday. An 
individual must be posted overseas and must file for an extension and pay 
estimated taxes by the due date. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the government waived any penalties for those taxpayers who did not 
list a Social Security number for any child or dependent over age 5. In 1988, 
it will assess a $5 fee per child or dependent when a Social Security number is 
not listed. 
</P>
<P>
TAX RATES 
</P>
<P>
Under tax reform, you do not pay a flat rate on your entire taxable income. 
Instead, new tax rates mean that you pay 15% on the first portion of your 
income, 28% on the next and 33% on the next; then the rate drops back to 28%. 
The income cutoffs for these portions vary according to your filing status and 
exemptions. In addition, high-income individuals whose tax rate drops back to 
28% pay a surcharge that eliminates the benefit of a personal exemption. The 
chart below shows the income cutoff levels for various filing statuses.

<P>
Tax shelters these days have gone the way of the California condor and 39-cent 
hamburgers. They are nearly extinct. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't always that way. In the late 1970s and early '80s, "gimme shelter" 
was the cry of rich and not-so-rich taxpayers alike. No wonder: Investing in 
anything from windmills to avocado groves to cattle semen could let you take 
immediate tax deductions of as much as five times what you put in. And you 
could use the deductions to shelter any kind of income, including your salary, 
stock dividends or savings account interest. 
</P>
<P>
But Congress formally ended the party with the Tax Reform Act of 1986. With 
only a few exceptions, traditional tax shelters such as real estate limited 
partnerships have lost their appeal as shelters. Losses from these investments 
are now classified as "passive" and can only be used to shield "passive" income 
from similar shelters. 
</P>
<P>
Tax reform made shelters less attractive in another way: By lowering individual 
tax rates, the new tax laws made deductions worth less. With the top individual 
tax rate now at 33% -- less than half the 70% top rate in 1980 -- each $1 in 
deductions saves you no more than 33 cents in taxes, compared to as much as 70 
cents nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, most investments that previously qualified as tax shelters now are 
oriented toward generating income. You must now evaluate them on their 
economics -- their tax benefits alone won't make them profitable. 
</P>
<P>
"There just aren't many shelters left that you can use to shelter ordinary 
income," says Fuhrman Nettles, vice president at Robert A. Stanger &amp; Co., a 
Shrewsbury, N.J., company that tracks limited partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
There is, however, a partial break still left if you bought your shelter before 
Oct. 22, 1986. In that case, you can still use 20% of losses to shelter 
ordinary income. But that will drop to 10% next year and then vanish completely 
in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
And some shelters survived tax reform. They can still be used to reduce 
ordinary income, regardless of when they were bought. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a brief rundown on those surviving shelters: 
</P>
<P>
* Rental real estate. If you rent out a home, condominium, apartment or other 
residential building -- and your income is not too high -- you can enjoy one of 
the best tax breaks left intact under tax reform. 
</P>
<P>
You can deduct losses from these properties of up to $25,000 each year against 
any kind of income. However, to qualify you must meet a few tests. 
</P>
<P>
First, your adjusted gross income must be below $150,000. If it's below 
$100,000, you can take up to the full $25,000. If it's between $100,000 and 
$150,000, the $25,000 ceiling will be reduced by 50 cents for each $1 your 
income exceeds $100,000. If your adjusted gross income exceeds $150,000, losses 
must be treated as passive, deductible only against passive income. 
</P>
<P>
Also, you must own at least 10% of the property. And you must make management 
decisions such as approving tenants, although a professional management company 
can maintain the property and collect rent. 
</P>
<P>
These tax breaks can make the difference between profit and loss, because 
rental income alone may not be sufficient to cover your mortgage payments and 
other costs. And with rental properties, you can earn profits through rent 
increases and price appreciation -- something many California investors are 
currently enjoying. 
</P>
<P>
But brokers' commissions and maintenance costs could eat away at profits. 
Another common risk: The possibility that your tenants may damage your property 
and be hard to evict. 
</P>
<P>
* Real estate limited partnerships. Real estate limited partnerships -- 
investing in office buildings, shopping centers, apartments or other commercial 
property -- are by far the most popular form of limited partnerships. But 
unless they invest in low-income housing or historic rehabilitations, they 
generally are no longer suitable as tax shelters. 
</P>
<P>
In a limited partnership, you and other "limited partners" invest money into a 
fund to be managed by so-called general partners. You get a share of any 
profits, and your losses are limited to the amount you invest. A major 
advantage is that you can get in with initial investment of as little as 
$5,000. 
</P>
<P>
But with some exceptions noted below, losses are considered passive. And 
partnerships can lose money due to poor investments or price declines. 
Commercial real estate prices were often artificially inflated a few years ago 
when tax benefits were still generous, notes Dick Poladian, tax partner at the 
accounting firm of Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
* Low-income housing and historic rehabilitations. These limited partnerships 
are the most generous form of tax shelters. That is because they offer tax 
credits, which reduce taxes dollar for dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Both types of partnerships offer tax credits that will let you write off up to 
$25,000 a year from your taxable income. So if you are in the 33% tax bracket, 
the maximum credit you can claim is $8,250 (that is the tax you save if you 
reduce your taxable income by $25,000, equal to 33% of $25,000). 
</P>
<P>
However, to qualify for the full credit, your adjusted gross income must be 
less than $200,000. If your adjusted gross income is between $200,000 and 
$250,000, the credit phases out by 50 cents for each $1 your income exceeds 
$200,000. 
</P>
<P>
For the low-income housing credit, the amount of the credit depends on the type 
of housing involved in the project and when you place the building or buildings 
in service. Check with the IRS to find out the exact credit, but a typical 
program might offer a credit of 9% of your investment each year for about 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
For historic rehabs, you generally can take more of the credit up front. The 
credit is limited to 10% of the amount you spend to fix up a building built 
before 1936 or 20% of the amount you spend rehabilitating a designated 
certified historic structure. To find out what buildings carry that 
designation, check with your local historical society or the Interior 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
But beware: These partnerships could still lose money. So shop carefully. 
</P>
<P>
And Congress may scale down the historic rehab credit to garner new tax 
revenues, says Sidney Kess, tax partner at the accounting firm of Peat Marwick 
Main &amp; Co. Existing partnerships may be grandfathered, however. 
</P>
<P>
* Oil and gas limited partnerships. Like real estate limited partnerships, oil 
and gas partnerships no longer work as pure tax shelters. They are subject to 
the same passive loss rules as other limited partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
There is, however, one exception. "Working interest" partnerships still allow 
you to shelter all kinds of income. But in exchange, you must subject yourself 
to greater legal and financial responsibility. For example, you may have to put 
up more money than you originally invested if it is needed to finance drilling 
costs. Or you may be liable if problems develop, such as an explosion or 
greater-than-anticipated debts. 
</P>
<P>
While you can insure yourself against such risks, Peat Marwick's Kess says, 
these deals are risky in another way: They can still lose money. And as with 
real estate limited partnerships, you may have to hold your interest for 
several years; it may be hard to sell in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
* Retirement plans. Investments -- whether savings accounts, stocks, bonds or 
mutual funds -- can accumulate earnings tax free if placed into individual 
retirement accounts, Keogh plans or 401(k) company savings plans. And the money 
you invest may itself be deductible, provided you meet certain tests. 
</P>
<P>
* Annuities and life insurance. Annuities operate like IRAs in that income can 
build up on a tax-deferred basis. 
</P>
<P>
Certain life insurance plans also can provide various tax benefits. For 
example, the savings, or "cash-value" portion, of a policy can grow tax free, 
unless withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
However, a tax bill passed last year made some of these benefits harder to come 
by. For policies issued after June 20, 1988, you must pay premiums over at 
least seven years to qualify for certain tax breaks. Previously, you could pay 
a single, one-time premium and qualify. 
</P>
<P>
* Series EE savings bonds. Starting in 1990, they will be exempt from federal 
tax under certain conditions, if proceeds are used for college education. 
</P>
<P>
* Municipal bonds. Their interest income is exempt from federal tax and may be 
exempt from state tax too, if you live in the same state as the agency issuing 
the bond. 
</P>
<P>
* Treasury bills, notes and bonds. They are taxable on the federal level but 
are exempt from state and local taxes.

IRS personnel gave the correct answer on only 64% of telephoned tax queries, 
and government auditors said a major reason was a failure to press questioners 
for details. 
</P>
<P>
A survey by the General Accounting Office, involving 1,733 test calls during 
the last return-filing season, also found that the IRS was even less likely to 
give the right answer in matters affected by recent changes in tax law. 
</P>
<P>
"IRS assistors' failure to probe for all of the pertinent facts before 
answering GAO's questions was a primary reason for the 36% inaccuracy rate," 
the congressional watchdog agency said in a report to Congress. "Of 20 test 
questions, 17 required assistors to probe to correctly understand and answer 
the question." 
</P>
<P>
When answers to only those 17 questions are considered, the IRS was wrong 39% 
of the time. Questions requiring no further details produced correct responses 
78% of the time, the GAO reported. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO emphasized that the inaccuracy rate applies only to the specific 
questions that were asked -- and not necessarily to all the questions taxpayers 
are likely to ask. However, the IRS' own check of actual taxpayer calls last 
spring indicated that its telephone personnel provided the correct answer just 
72.4% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
IRS Commissioner Lawrence B. Gibbs, in responding to the latest GAO report, 
said the IRS was well into a program to improve the skills of the telephone 
"assistors" before the current filing season. 
</P>
<P>
"We . . . have expanded assistor training on probing skills," Gibbs said. "In 
addition, we continue to emphasize to all managers the need for quality review 
and providing immediate feedback to assistors who fail to probe completely."

A GOOD BOOK CAN HELP YOU SAVE BIG ON YOUR INCOME TAXES.

<P>
By MIKE QUINN, Mike Quinn is a Southern California free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the tax laws the way they are today, it is easy to be pigeonholed among 
the fabulously wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: To be in the same tax bracket as the Rockefellers, your taxable 
income need only be $17,851 if you are single, or $29,751 if you are married 
and filing a joint return. Either amount puts you into the 28% bracket, the 
same one applicable to the very rich. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the tax simplification and reform act of 1986 created about 40 new 
Internal Revenue Service forms while many deductions and credits used 
extensively by middle-income taxpayers were abolished. 
</P>
<P>
While the "super rich" have accountants and advisers to deal with such matters, 
the rest of us are often left to flounder. To the rescue comes a crop of income 
tax books, aimed primarily at middle-income taxpayers who must be willing to 
spend some time to save some money. 
</P>
<P>
Beware, most of these books are thick -- 600 pages or so. They all follow the 
same general format: guiding a person through the preparation of a federal 
income tax return, starting with Form 1040 and ending with Form 8582, passive 
activity loss limitations. Along the way, some provide more help than others in 
actually completing the forms. Some provide much more advice on reducing or 
avoiding taxes. 
</P>
<P>
For tax novices, there are two good selections: "H&amp;R Block 1989 Income Tax 
Workbook" (Collier Books, Macmillan Publishing Co., $9.95) and "Winning on Your 
Income Taxes" by Dennis Kamensky (Winning Publications, $7.95). 
</P>
<P>
The text of the Block book increased by more than 50% over the 1988 edition. 
The simplified workbook approach has not changed. Pages 11 and 12 offer a "self 
interview guide" that narrows in quickly on what forms must be used. The book 
includes "an encyclopedia of tax" that is more a potpourri than an 
encyclopedia. 
</P>
<P>
Kamensky's self-published book is filled with good advice on preparing the 
forms. For instance, he devotes nearly a page to the seemingly innocuous 
"occupation" box at the very end of the 1040 form. He writes: "I am in no way 
advocating falsifying your job title, but look at the various aspects of your 
work and, without dishonesty, select a title that will allow you to take the 
most deductions." 
</P>
<P>
Kamensky argues that someone in a technical position who lists "clerk" will 
likely trigger an audit for legitimate deductions. He lists other occupations 
that should be avoided, if possible. 
</P>
<P>
The second batch of books, while helpful if preparing a return, are oriented 
more to explaining the tax law and advising people how to arrange their 
personal finances. These are the books that can answer the questions about 
special situations. All four are recommended as essential reference books. 
</P>
<P>
"Guide to Income Tax Preparation" by Warren H. Esanu, Barry Dickman, Elias M. 
Zuckerman and Michael N. Pollet (Consumers Union, $10.95) is written by four 
partners in a New York law firm. Last year's edition was the first, and this 
year the table of contents and the index have been expanded significantly. 
</P>
<P>
The publication stresses record-keeping in these days of ever-increasing 
cross-checking by computer. A handy list of records you should keep quickly 
tells what should be maintained or kept to support exemptions, income, 
adjustments to income, itemized deductions and credits. 
</P>
<P>
"Sprouse's Income Tax Handbook 1989" by Mary L. Sprouse (Penguin Books, $9.95) 
is the only tax book with jokes and puns. Sprouse, a tax law attorney who lives 
in Los Angeles, admits to being an English and history major in college. She 
clearly enjoys her subject, especially in a 30-page section entitled "Eight 
Basic Tax Principles." Who else could make jokes about the accrual method of 
accounting? 
</P>
<P>
Part III of the guide contains special sections dealing with, for instance, tax 
shelters and tax advice for homeowners and executives. The chapter on 
home-based businesses is one of the best in any of the tax books on a special 
circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
"J. K. Lasser's Your Income Tax 1989" (J. K. Lasser Institute, $10.95) is the 
granddaddy in the income-tax book field. This edition is the 52nd. 
</P>
<P>
Like those before it, the Lasser guide is shorter on graphics than the others, 
but information is packed into this book. What's more, the index, the largest 
of any of these books, is divided into five sections: a general index plus 
specialized ones dealing with income inclusions, income exclusions, deductions 
and what may not be deducted. 
</P>
<P>
"The Arthur Young Tax Guide 1989" (Ballantine Books, $11.95) comes from the Big 
Eight accounting firm of Arthur Young &amp; Company. 
</P>
<P>
The format is unusual. The IRS publication, "Your Federal Income Tax," is 
reprinted. The official word is supplemented throughout with comments and 
suggestions from an army of professional tax preparers. 
</P>
<P>
The book, includes asides dubbed TaxPlanner or TaxSaver, advice that elucidates 
a section or aids in reducing the overall tax bite. 
</P>
<P>
And then there is the book you will need if "Trivial Pursuit" ever comes out 
with income tax questions. This publication, "Complete Book of Tax Deductions" 
(Harper &amp; Row, $10.95), is a compendium of deductions based on court 
decisions, IRS rulings and numerous other sources. 
</P>
<P>
This book answers these questions, as well as many others: Can I deduct the 
cost of treatment for narcotics addiction? (Yes.) Can I deduct the postage used 
to answer fan mail? (Yes.) Can I deduct for sonic-boom damage? (Yes.) 
</P>
<P>
It's not for most of us, but tax professionals could find a place for it on 
their bookshelves.

COMPUTER TAX PROGRAMS ARE FASTER, NEATER AND FREE OF ARITHMETIC ERRORS. BUT 
IT'S UP TO YOU TO KNOW THE IRS RULES.

<TEXT>
<P>
Using a personal computer to prepare your income tax returns seems like a 
natural. 
</P>
<P>
It is faster than doing taxes by hand, neater and free of arithmetic errors. 
</P>
<P>
But even with Ask Dan, the only program that gives tax advice, it isn't like 
sitting across the desk from a tax accountant. 
</P>
<P>
If you already do your taxes by hand and have a computer, you may want to try 
one of the three tax preparation programs reviewed here -- TaxView/MacInTax, 
TurboTax, or Ask Dan. 
</P>
<P>
TurboTax, $75, published by ChipSoft Inc. of San Diego, runs on IBM PCs and 
compatibles with as little as 256 kilobytes of memory and either two floppy 
drives or a hard drive. 
</P>
<P>
Ask Dan, $90, published by Legal Knowledge Systems Marketing in Drexel Hill, 
Penn., also runs on IBM PCs and compatibles with at least 512 kilobytes of 
memory and either two floppy drives or a hard drive. 
</P>
<P>
TaxView/MacInTax, $119, published by SoftView Inc. of Camarillo, runs on IBM 
and compatibles and on Macintosh computers. 
</P>
<P>
TaxView is the IBM version, requiring at least a PC/AT or compatible, with 640 
kilobytes of memory and a hard disk. You also must have a graphics monitor, 
preferably color. 
</P>
<P>
MacInTax is the Macintosh version, running on Mac 512Ke or any more powerful 
Mac model with either two floppy disk drives or a hard drive. 
</P>
<P>
TurboTax has companion state return programs for 41 states ($40 each). Ask Dan 
has state tax programs for California, New York and Massachusetts ($12 each). 
TaxView/MacInTax has state supplements for California and New York ($65 each). 
</P>
<P>
All three import financial data from other software, such as spreadsheets and 
databases. TurboTax goes a step further by importing directly from Quicken, 
Dollars &amp; Sense, Managing Your Money, and TurboTax Personal Finance 
Manager. 
</P>
<P>
All three include numerous tax forms that cover most individual and many small 
business taxpayer needs, with TaxView/MacInTax having the most complete list. 
Consult the list printed on the back of each package for details. Both TurboTax 
and TaxView/MacInTax print complete returns, including the form 1040, on most 
laser or dot matrix printers. The IRS is very fussy about the look of the form 
1040 that it will accept, and most other tax preparation programs, including 
Ask Dan, require special preprinted forms. 
</P>
<P>
TaxView/MacInTax and Ask Dan make it easy to prepare multiple returns. TurboTax 
makes it so difficult that only expert PC users should try. 
</P>
<P>
Their are big distinctions in the way the three programs work. 
</P>
<P>
TaxView/MacInTax presents a graphic facsimile of the tax forms on the screen, 
using Microsoft Windows on PCs (included with TaxView) or the built-in graphics 
ability of the Macintosh. The graphics make this program the easiest to use, 
but, a little slower than the others. 
</P>
<P>
Both versions use a mouse pointing device to move the screen cursor to the 
blank desired and execute the proper command by clicking on the mouse button. 
</P>
<P>
Highlight the desired line with the mouse and click once to enter data or click 
twice to reach a worksheet on which to itemize elements comprising that entry 
-- multiple cash contributions, for instance. Amounts are automatically totaled 
and carried forward as required. 
</P>
<P>
IRS instructions are available by moving the cursor to the appropriate text 
line on a form, clicking the button twice and reading them in the text window 
that pops up. Another click removes them from the screen. 
</P>
<P>
Calculations are automatically updated. The program keeps a list showing which 
forms are part of the return and which of those are not yet done. 
</P>
<P>
The manual is concise and easy to read. Veteran Mac or Windows program users 
will barely have to read it. Sections on the tax forms are adequate but skimpy. 
The program also includes a copy of Arthur Young's 1988 Federal Tax Highlights. 
</P>
<P>
There are a couple of glitches in these otherwise excellent programs, however. 
In both TaxView and MacInTax, it is cumbersome to reopen a tax file that you 
already have worked on. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the version of TaxView currently on dealers' shelves has some problems 
working smoothly and efficiently with Windows, especially in printing. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for SoftView said a new version of TaxView was being written and 
would be sent free to all registered users. I tested a preliminary release of 
the new version and it cured the printing problems I had with the original. Its 
laser printed 1040s were the best. 
</P>
<P>
TurboTax has been around longer than TaxView/MacInTax. By today's programming 
standards, it is needlessly awkward to use. 
</P>
<P>
A new feature this year puts a graphic image of the form on your screen similar 
to that displayed by TaxView/MacInTax. But the faster way to use TurboTax is 
with its text-based simulation of the tax forms. Color is used to good 
advantage to indicate various kinds of entries, if your computer is so 
equipped. 
</P>
<P>
TurboTax opens with a personal data entry form in which you supply names, 
social security numbers, filing status and other basic information that goes on 
the 1040 and other forms. The program transfers the entries where they are 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, you can waste time on that first form if you try to fill in the 
five-year tax history section, which is not needed in completing your tax 
return although the screen doesn't tell you that. (The history feature is 
automatically updated yearly from last year's return if you use TurboTax each 
year.) 
</P>
<P>
New this year is the Auto Interview Work Sheet that enables the program to 
select forms needed based on the answers. There is a depreciation and 
amortization work sheet where answers to a series of questions are distributed 
to several inter-dependent forms. 
</P>
<P>
The program uses a pop-up main menu and related sub menus to give users access 
to its various forms and functions. 
</P>
<P>
Single line entries on forms can be expanded to itemization worksheets, as in 
multiple cash contributions. 
</P>
<P>
For added speed, TurboTax normally does not make math calculations until you 
choose a menu item instructing it to do so. That can be disconcerting because 
forms will appear incomplete, and data won't transfer from one form to another 
until you issue the calculation command. You can set it to automatically 
recalculate, but the program slows noticeably, especially if you are working in 
the graphics mode. 
</P>
<P>
TurboTax has other awkward features. For one, ChipSoft still hasn't developed a 
simple, rational way to move from one blank to another on a form. 
</P>
<P>
Deletion or modification of erroneous entries is too difficult. 
</P>
<P>
It is hard to find the on-screen IRS instructions for forms because the command 
to reach them is buried at the bottom of a sub-menu where users are apt not to 
find it. 
</P>
<P>
The manual is clear, thank goodness, because even experienced computer users 
will have to read a substantial portion before successfully working with 
TurboTax. The section on individual forms is complete and easy to understand. 
No tax manuals are included with the program. 
</P>
<P>
Ask Dan is different from other tax preparation programs because it gives tax 
guidance to users. 
</P>
<P>
There is an "Ask Dan" question-and-answer sequence available at the touch of a 
keystroke to help guide users in completing many, but not all, of the entries 
on various form. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, in the section on charitable contributions under Schedule A, Ask 
Dan warns of 16 "Tax Trap" situations where contributions are not deductible. 
Among them, gifts to social clubs, raffle ticket purchases and the value of 
time and services. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Ask Dan advises that the standard mileage method of depreciating a 
car is usually better than the alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
In another section, computer owners are reminded that if they write letters to 
friends on the computer they are not using it 100% for business, as required to 
obtain the full deduction. 
</P>
<P>
Ask Dan reviews completed returns and makes comments. It will tell you, for 
instance, that large medical expense deductions, large state and local tax 
deductions, large contributions and business use of the home, if present, are 
triggers for IRS audits. 
</P>
<P>
It also will offer advice, depending on your return, such as suggesting that 
you and your spouse consider filing separately or think about buying tax-free 
bonds to reduce taxes next year. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the help and advice, there is nothing fancy about Ask Dan. It has no 
graphic renditions of the tax forms to display on your screen and its work 
sheets and "scratch pad" screens for toting up itemizations are very simple. 
</P>
<P>
There is one bothersome glitch in Ask Dan, however. It is cumbersome to carry 
figures forward from a scratch pad work sheet to the form on which they 
belong.Want More Info?

It's no secret that the Tax Reform Act of 1986 made homeownership one of the 
last great tax shelters. The landmark overhaul of the nation's tax codes 
preserved deductions for mortgage-interest payments but reduced or eliminated 
writeoffs for most other types of investments. 
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, the sanctity of housing-related tax breaks -- coupled 
with fast-rising home values in California and many other parts of the country 
-- has made owning a home more than just a shelter from the cold and the tax 
collector. 
</P>
<P>
Now, experts say, it must also be viewed as a key component of your overall 
financial game plan. 
</P>
<P>
"Owning a home is one of the last tax shelters available to most investors, but 
it's also one of the most expensive," said Martin M. Shenkman, a New York tax 
attorney and author of several real estate books. "So, you've got to know how 
to squeeze every last bit of writeoffs out of it and then use your equity to 
help you achieve your other financial goals." 
</P>
<P>
Under the tax codes, you can deduct interest on up to $1 million in combined 
debt used to build or buy a first and second home. You can also deduct the 
property taxes you pay, as well as a handful of certain charges you incur when 
setting up the loan. 
</P>
<P>
Since deductions for interest payments on credit cards and most other types of 
non-mortgage debt are being phased out -- only 20% of that interest will be 
deductible on your 1989 tax return -- many experts today say most taxpayers 
should borrow as much as possible against their home and as little as possible 
to purchase other items. 
</P>
<P>
That's a turnaround from the philosophy of just a few years ago, when many 
experts advised taking out 15-year mortgages or making relatively large down 
payments to sharply reduce interest costs over the life of the loan. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, you can't let the tail wag the dog," said Thomas B. Gau, partner in 
the Torrance-based financial planning firm Kavesh &amp; Gau. "If you take on a 
big mortgage just so you can get a lot of writeoffs, you might wind up putting 
too much strain on your monthly budget." 
</P>
<P>
If you already own your own home, there's a good chance that fast-rising home 
values over the past few years have helped you build up tens of thousands of 
dollars in equity. A home equity loan can let you tap that reserve for even 
more writeoffs and, at the same time, provide you with cash to make other 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
Most homeowners can deduct interest charges on up to $100,000 of home equity 
borrowing, regardless of how the money is spent. If you're single or are 
married but file separately, the limit is $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
If a home equity loan sounds enticing, proceed with caution. "Don't fall for 
those advertisements that tempt you to take out a home equity loan to pay for a 
Caribbean cruise or a mink coat," said Lawrence A. Krause, president of a San 
Francisco-based financial planning firm that bears his name. "Only take one out 
if you're going to use the money for serious purposes -- like financing a 
college education, remodeling your home, starting your own business or helping 
your kids buy their first home." 
</P>
<P>
You might also want to take out a home equity loan and use the proceeds to pay 
off high-interest credit card balances and auto loans. By shifting that debt to 
your mortgage, you'll side-step the phase-out of writeoffs for non-mortgage 
debt and retain the ability to deduct all your interest charges. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, the more money you owe on credit cards and the like, the more sense 
it makes to take out a home equity loan and pay off that non-mortgage debt," 
said financial planner Gau. "If you just have a few thousand dollars in debt, 
shifting it to your mortgage probably won't be worth it -- the fees involved in 
setting up the home equity loan up will probably wipe out all of your tax 
savings." 
</P>
<P>
When you sell your home, you'll be able to defer paying taxes on your resale 
profit, if you buy a home of equal or greater value. If you have built up a lot 
of equity, balancing your need for mortgage-interest deductions against your 
other investment objectives will help you figure out how large of a down 
payment you should make on the new house. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're in your 30s or 40s and have plenty of other investments, you can go 
ahead and make a 20% of 30% down payment on the new home," said Krause. 
</P>
<P>
"But if you don't have much in the way of other investments, think about 
putting just 10% down and putting the rest of your money into mutual funds, a 
retirement account or some other investment vehicle," he said. "You don't want 
to have every last penny tied up in your house, and the writeoffs (from the 
mortgage-interest payments) will shelter a lot of your income." 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, people who are in their late 40s or 50s may want to forgo the tax 
advantages that a large mortgage can provide and instead consider financing 
their next purchase with a 15-year loan. 
</P>
<P>
"People who are in their 40s or 50s are in their peak earning years, so they're 
the ones who will have the easiest time handling the higher monthly payments 
that come from a 15-year loan," said Joe Knott, tax partner in the Los Angeles 
office of real estate consultants Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
"They won't get all the writeoffs that a 30-year mortgage would give them, but 
they can make other tax-advantaged investments. The important consideration 
here is that they'll have their home paid off by the time they retire." 
</P>
<P>
If you sell your home and you're 55 or older, you're eligible for a one-time 
tax exclusion that lets you keep up to $125,000 of your resale profits tax 
free. But there are some contingencies: The house must have been your primary 
residence for three of the past five years, and you can't take the exclusion if 
you or your spouse have claimed it before. 
</P>
<P>
Owning a second home isn't as attractive today as it was under the old tax 
codes. Previously, you could count on hefty deductions to offset a large 
portion of the home's carrying costs, such as loan payments, property taxes and 
utility charges. 
</P>
<P>
Now, there are strict rules on who can take those writeoffs and who can't. One 
set of rules applies to owners who use their hideaways infrequently, and 
another set applies to those who use them more often. 
</P>
<P>
If you or a member of your immediate family stay in the home for more than 14 
days -- or for more than 10% of the number of days it's rented to others, 
whichever is greater -- the property will be classified as a personal 
residence. Stay in the property for 14 or fewer days, or less than 10% of the 
time it's rented out, and the home will be considered a rental property. 
</P>
<P>
If your second home is classified as a personal residence, you can only deduct 
your payments for mortgage interest and property taxes. Even then, you won't be 
able to deduct all your interest if the loans on both your first and second 
homes total more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Should your hideaway be considered a rental property, you may be able to take 
writeoffs for depreciation, maintenance, homeowners fees and other items -- as 
well as for mortgage payments and property taxes -- if you actively manage the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, you're considered "active" if you manage the property yourself or if 
you personally select someone to manage the property for you. If you hire a 
manager, you can add an extra layer of protection against a possible tax audit 
by including a clause in the management contract that says you must personally 
approve new tenants and large repair bills. 
</P>
<P>
The key to determining whether you're better off treating the property as a 
residence or rental property is your adjusted gross income. 
</P>
<P>
If your adjusted gross income is $100,000 or less and you actively manage the 
property, you can deduct up to $25,000 in losses that the property generates. 
This tax break is phased out for taxpayers who earn between $100,000 and 
$150,000. 
</P>
<P>
Taxpayers who make more than $150,000 -- as well as those who aren't active 
owners -- can only write off losses the property generates if they have an 
equal or greater amount of "passive" income, such as earnings from a limited 
partnership. 
</P>
<P>
"If the property is generating a lot of losses and you're eligible to write 
them all off, you'll probably be better off tax-wise by calling it a rental 
property," Shenkman said. "It means limiting your use of the home, but the 
deductions may be worth it. 
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, if you can't write off the losses, you're probably better 
off calling the property a personal residence," he said. That's because you'd 
at least be able to deduct all your property taxes and mortgage-interest 
payments, as long as the total amount of debt on both your first and second 
home doesn't exceed $1 million.

BILL OF RIGHTS;

NEW RULES CAN HELP IF YOU FEEL THE IRS HAS DONE YOU WRONG.

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's still an unequal contest when the lone individual comes up against the 
mighty Internal Revenue Service, but the new taxpayer bill of rights offers 
some long-awaited defenses and protections. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the law forbids the use of quotas or dollar goals to 
measure the efficiency of IRS agents. No longer can an agent be promoted on the 
basis of his seizures of property and bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
IRS policy forbids any quotas, but local agents and managers often ignored 
Washington's mandate. They can't do it anymore -- managers will be required to 
sign a statement twice a year that they don't use quotas to rate their agents' 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
"By making such a prohibition part of law, rather than a mere policy, it cannot 
be so easily ignored, and it can be enforced in court," said Sen. David Pryor 
(D-Ark.), the prime author of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The audit and collection process will be stripped of some of its fearful nature 
for nervous citizens. A taxpayer calling for an interview at an IRS office may 
choose to stay home, sending a representative to speak for him. Before, the 
taxpayer had to attend the interview, even if his accountant did all the 
talking. 
</P>
<P>
If a taxpayer goes to the interview personally, he can stop the discussion at 
any time. "Most people think they can handle things, but they go down on their 
own and often get in trouble," said Paul W. Raymond, a Newport Beach tax 
attorney. "Talking too much is a common mistake." 
</P>
<P>
The taxpayer can say, "I don't feel comfortable talking to you any further," 
get up and walk out, and have all future contacts handled by his lawyer or 
accountant, Raymond said. Individuals always had this right -- but now the IRS 
is obliged to inform them of this before the audit begins. 
</P>
<P>
The individual can also make an audio or videotape recording of the interview. 
Previously, each IRS district had its own policy on taping. 
</P>
<P>
The bill of rights, which took effect Jan. 1, greatly expands the powers of the 
ombudsmen, the officially appointed protectors of the taxpayers within the IRS 
system itself. These protectors are known as problem resolution officers. They 
negotiate on behalf of aggrieved taxpayers with the complex IRS bureaucracy. 
For example, an officer might ask that a proposed seizure be stopped because it 
would cause hardship to a taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, ombudsmen can do more than ask: They are given the legal 
powers to order a halt to the collection process. 
</P>
<P>
"This is extremely important for taxpayers," Raymond said. "We now have a 
significant bargaining chip in dealing with the collections (division). We can 
say, 'This guy needs the money for an operation, or his house payment, or for 
his daughter's college tuition.' " These would be defined as hardships and the 
ombudsman could stop the seizure of bank accounts or wages, according to 
Raymond. 
</P>
<P>
Pryor had praised IRS Commissioner Lawrence B. Gibbs for creating the ombudsman 
process, but insisted on making it part of the law to give the protection a 
permanent place in the IRS structure. 
</P>
<P>
IRS district offices now have available Form 911, the application for taxpayer 
assistance, a request for emergency intervention by an ombudsman to prevent a 
taxpayer from suffering a hardship. The orders "would cut through bureaucratic 
red tape to suspend any action of the IRS," noted Pryor. The ombudsman decides 
if the IRS acted correctly, or if its decision should be rescinded. 
</P>
<P>
These expanded protections continue through the entire collection process and 
into the final step, the seizure of a taxpayer's assets. Previously, the IRS 
could confiscate bank accounts and other assets 10 days after giving a final 
warning to the taxpayer. The waiting period for liens is extended to 30 days, 
giving the individual a slightly longer grace period to try raising the money 
to pay the tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, taxpayers can sue the IRS when its employees "recklessly or 
carelessly" ignore the Internal Revenue Code during collection activity. "This 
is another very important protection," Raymond said. The aggrieved taxpayer can 
collect damages up to $100,000 for the misconduct of IRS employees. Supporters 
of the legislation say this will cause some overzealous IRS agents to be much 
more careful and precise in their preparation of cases. 
</P>
<P>
Taxpayers jousting with the government also are now permitted greater latitude 
in recouping legal and accounting fees if they win a case against the IRS. 
Traditionally, taxpayers could recover these expenses only in very limited 
circumstances in connection with court cases. 
</P>
<P>
Now the fees can be recovered if the taxpayer demonstrates that the IRS acted 
unreasonably. The award isn't just restricted to expenses in court but also 
covers the earlier charges for lawyers and accountants at the administrative 
appeals level of the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS must recognize and rectify mistakes, the new law says. For example, the 
IRS previously enforced penalties against a taxpayer whose mistakes were based 
on bad advice from the IRS itself. Under the new law, the government can't levy 
any penalties if the taxpayer got erroneous written advice from the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a taxpayer can recover damages if the IRS fails to remove an 
incorrect lien on his property. The taxpayer might have paid his full 
obligation, but the government neglected to remove a lien on his house. If the 
sale of the house falls through because of the lien, the individual could sue 
the IRS for damages. 
</P>
<P>
IRS policy forbids any quotas, but local agents and managers often ignored 
Washington's mandate. They can't do it anymore -- managers will be required to 
sign a statement twice a year that they don't use quotas to rate their agents' 
performance.

IRS SAYS MORE SHORTER, SIMPLER FORMS RETURNED THIS YEAR

A growing number of Americans are filing simpler tax forms, apparently because 
the new tax law reduced or eliminated several beneficial deductions. 
</P>
<P>
The number filing the long Form 1040 is down 4.2% this year, the Internal 
Revenue Service said last week. The number filing the "short" Form 1040A is up 
7.5%; 6.8% more taxpayers are filing the simplest form, 1040EZ, than at this 
time last year. 
</P>
<P>
"These figures suggest that many taxpayers who filed Form 1040 in the past may 
be switching to the simpler, shorter forms," the IRS said. 
</P>
<P>
The 1986 tax overhaul eliminated deductions for state and local sales taxes and 
two-earner couples and began phasing out the deduction for consumer interest. 
It also reduced writeoffs for medical expenses, and, for millions of workers, 
it cut or eliminated deductions for Individual Retirement Accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Through Feb. 24, halfway through the filing season, the IRS had received 30.8 
million returns -- only about 28% of the 109 million expected to file this 
year. That is up 2% from the 30.2 million at this time last year. This year's 
receipts included 13.1 million Forms 1040, 8.5 million 1040As and 9.1 million 
1040EZs. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS had processed almost half the returns and had approved refund checks 
for almost 8.3 million taxpayers, up 9% from last year. The refunds totaled 
$6.8 billion, an increase of almost 14% averaged $825, up from $793 at this 
time last year.

Say buddy, can you spare 10 grand? 
</P>
<P>
Inflation has taken its toll on just about everything by now -- the nickel 
cigar, the dime novel, the $500 claw hammer -- but it seems that not so long 
ago you could satisfy an outstretched hand with pocket change. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays it's another story. Been over to South Coast Repertory Theatre in 
Costa Mesa lately? 
</P>
<P>
Once you finish reading the program notes for George Bernard Shaw's "You Never 
Can Tell" and start flipping through the rest of the Performing Arts magazine 
that the ushers hand everyone, you well might come across the page that bears 
"A Letter from Mrs. Richard J. Flamson, III." 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Flamson is vice president of the SCR endowment fund. She's also chairman 
of the Campaign for SCR. In other words, she's in charge of getting out the 
bucks. And in her enthusiasm for "keeping the traditions of innovation and 
excellence vital for the next 25 years," Mrs. Flamson has thought of a way that 
"you can help." 
</P>
<P>
To wit: "Even if you regularly support the annual fund, or have never given a 
gift to the theater before, I invite you to consider a special gift of $10,000 
or more during SCR's 25th season to say how important this cultural resource is 
to you and how much you would like to see it continue with strength into the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
Ten thousand dollars or more? Let's see now, where did I set my wallet? I know 
I got change at lunch -- hmmm . . . was that a 10 or a 20-G note I gave the 
waitress? 
</P>
<P>
I appreciate that it takes a lot of money to run an organization as 
sophisticated and ambitious as SCR, but honestly. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Maybe if you spend a lot of time around folks whose numeral systems begin at 1 
million, reeling off a request for $10,000 is no big deal. (Item: "In 
October,," Mrs. Flamson writes, "General and Mrs. William Lyon announced a 
generous $250,000 challenge grant to help us complete the final $750,000 in our 
$6-million capital fund effort.") 
</P>
<P>
But me, I get still steamed at organizations that send out mailers where the 
lowest contribution box you can check is for $50. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, they usually have that blank space where you can write in a lesser amount 
if you want, but it might just as well read " $500, $250, $100, $50 and [don't 
bother)." Sort of makes you wonder whether there's not something to the 
argument that culture is strictly for those who spell it M-O-N-E-Y. 
</P>
<P>
But so what if Orange County is Land of the Financial Giants? A far more 
democratic, not to mention more realistic, approach would be to go after $10 
from 1,000 ordinary folks, rather than wait for the $10,000 checks to start 
flowing in. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, "democratic" is a bad word here, isn't it? I guess my problem is 
that I still think of money in terms of record albums. It goes back to that 
turning point in my professional life when I got a paycheck big enough that I 
could buy two albums in the same day. So when I hear "$10,000," all I can think 
is with that much cash, I could buy pretty near every Elvis record there is. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Flamson's letter goes on: 
</P>
<P>
"An endowment gift has a transcendent quality." (I'll say. Who couldn't 
transcend a lot of bill collectors with an extra 10 grand?) "You can endow a 
program of the theater in perpetuity or provide for the theater's future 
physical growth." (Hey, for any potential donors who maybe aren't theater fans, 
give me a call and I'll provide you with the name, address and bank account 
number of a hard-working writer whom you can endow in perpetuity and provide 
for his future physical growth.) 
</P>
<P>
I wasn't able to reach Mrs. Flamson this week to find out what kind of response 
she's had to the letter. Perhaps I'm all wet and SCR is flush with checks for 
$10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, maybe Mrs. Flamson is looking at it like the guy who opens a 
business selling solid platinum yardsticks for $500,000 apiece. You don't need 
a flood of takers -- just that one. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of money, what with Orange County having the highest median housing 
price in the nation and an abundance of two-career couples struggling to make 
ends meet, not to mention the high cost of raising kids these days, most of the 
people I know have a tough time just scraping together $25 bucks to buy a 
ticket to SCR (parking, dinner, baby-sitter and spouse's ticket not included). 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, they seem to have taken note of the economy: The Mark Taper 
Forum has initiated a pay-as-you-can policy for certain midweek performances 
that lets people buy tickets for whatever they can afford. The idea, says one 
theater official, is to eliminate high ticket prices as an excuse for people 
not to attend. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone down here listening? 
</P>
<P>
It might work. You never know: For every financially strapped theater lover who 
can only afford $4 or $5 to get in, there might just be someone who's got an 
extra, oh, say, $10,000.

LA HABRA 'HOMEBOY': 'WHY' STILL BAFFLES

<P>
It has been more than 3 years since Jose Luis Razo crouched in a trash bin 
outside a La Habra dairy and made a decision that changed the course of his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
The Harvard University freshman had just returned home from Cambridge to spend 
the holidays with his family. Now, the day after Christmas, he hid behind the 
Driftwood Dairy, down the street from the Catholic church where, as a 
precocious grammar school pupil, he first demonstrated the academic and 
athletic abilities that would take him out of the barrio. 
</P>
<P>
With a .22-caliber pistol in his hand and a ski mask pulled over his face, Razo 
waited until there were no customers in the store, then emerged from the 
dumpster and robbed the elderly owner of $60. 
</P>
<P>
"I was afraid he would kill," said the robbery victim, Damnang Meas during 
Razo's preliminary hearing in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first of more than a dozen holdups that Razo, now 22, says he 
committed while home on breaks during his first 2 years at Harvard. His 
confession to police -- and later to The Times and other newspapers -- in July, 
1987, shocked La Habra's close-knit Latino community, which had been enormously 
proud of Razo and still expected great things to come. 
</P>
<P>
This month, Razo's trial for 10 robberies in Orange County is scheduled to get 
under way. His trial in Los Angeles County for three more robberies is 
scheduled to begin in April. 
</P>
<P>
Razo's strange saga made national news when it first came to light, and lawyers 
in the case expect the trial to produce the same kind of interest. Eighteen 
months after Razo called La Habra police and confirmed their suspicions that he 
was the "ski-mask bandit" who had terrorized clerks in fast-food restaurants, 
markets and stores, the question of why remains baffling. 
</P>
<P>
Until his arrest, Razo's life had had a storybook quality: A Mexican immigrant 
raised in humble surroundings, he had excelled as a student and athlete at 
demanding parochial schools and had taken on responsibility as a community 
youth leader. At the country's most prestigious university, Razo was an 
above-average student and a hard-nosed, respected football player. 
</P>
<P>
But there were also a few blemishes on his record. In 1983, a "theft matter" 
involving Razo was handled "informally" by Fullerton police, according to court 
documents. No further information about that incident was available. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Razo, then 17, was made a ward of juvenile court for stealing a wallet 
from an unlocked car in La Habra. That same year, Razo was charged with assault 
and battery after he got involved in a fight at a party in Brea. Razo admitted 
fighting with two individuals at the party, but he said the fight started when 
one of them made "derogatory remarks about Mexicans," according to court 
records. Brea police agreed that the incident was one of mutual combat, and the 
charges were eventually dropped. 
</P>
<P>
And in 1986, Razo was arrested and charged with misdemeanor grand theft. The 
incident involved the theft of a watch and sunglasses from a student from a 
rival high school at a party in La Habra. That charge was dismissed the 
following year "in the interest of justice," court records show. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kept It Well-Hidden 
</P>
<P>
Richard Guthrie, director of the Boys' Club of La Habra, where Razo spent 
hundreds of hours as a youth, said that he and others at the club knew about 
the 1986 incident, but no one paid it much heed. 
</P>
<P>
"He kept it very well-hidden," Guthrie said. "It could have been a strong 
signal that something was amiss." 
</P>
<P>
While he was an outstanding student at Our Lady of Guadalupe School, teachers 
noted that Razo was sometimes unruly. His seventh-grade teacher, Rose Stalon, 
wrote on his report card, "Jose's behavior in class is very disruptive." 
</P>
<P>
On a later report card, Stalon wrote that Jose's behavior had shown "some 
improvement" and that he was "helpful in many ways." 
</P>
<P>
Razo's principal at Our Lady of Guadalupe, Sister Mary Louise, now in Northern 
California, said that Razo was "one of the most brilliant boys" she had ever 
had. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Natural Leader' 
</P>
<P>
"He was a natural leader," she said. "He was innately very bright. . . . What 
Jose said, and what Jose did, others willingly followed him." 
</P>
<P>
Louise said that Razo maintained contact with her even after he went to 
Harvard. "He was proud that I was proud of him," she said. "He would tell me 
what kind of a place it (Cambridge) was . . . about the football team. . . . He 
wondered if the games were televised here." 
</P>
<P>
Razo and family members declined recent requests to talk before his upcoming 
trial. In his statements to reporters and police in 1987, Razo said that he 
used the money from the robberies to help his family and friends and also to 
buy drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever my family wanted, it got," Razo said in a jailhouse interview in 
July, 1987. "I needed money for school and plane flights back and forth from 
Harvard." 
</P>
<P>
He also said that he didn't fit in at Harvard and that no one there understood 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a homeboy now," Razo said, then added in Spanish: "I don't sell out my 
own ethnic identity." 
</P>
<P>
Before he dropped the case because of an unspecified conflict of interest, 
deputy public defender James S. Egar said the case revolved around "mental 
issues" -- the pressures Razo felt as the symbol of success for a depressed 
neighborhood and the isolation he experienced as one of the few Latinos at 
Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Truth Is Confounding' 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is so confounding in this case," Egar said. "He used to tell his mom 
that he would buy her a house in Beverly Hills when he was a lawyer. In one 
day, he went from the shining star of his family to a con . . . an inmate, just 
another Mexican armed robber." 
</P>
<P>
Razo's current court-appointed attorney, John D. Barnett, is less inclined to 
talk about the problems his client might have had bridging the distinctive 
worlds of Harvard and La Habra, saying only that Razo's background "will have a 
place in the case." 
</P>
<P>
Barnett, in contrast with Egar, steadfastly maintains his client is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
He plans to introduce evidence showing that Razo confessed to crimes he did not 
commit and that his statements to police were obtained by "constitutionally 
deficient" means, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Barnett would not say why Razo would confess to robberies he did not do but 
said it will be "interesting" to find that out during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
"People confess to crimes they don't do all the time," Barnett said. "The 
techniques and behavior of the police . . . resulted in the receipt of an 
unreliable series of statements." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Confused, Vulnerable' 
</P>
<P>
During Razo's preliminary hearing, defense attorney Egar attacked the validity 
of the confession on a number of grounds. One key area was Razo's unusual 
behavior while talking to the police that Egar said showed his client's state 
of mind to have been "confused, vulnerable, volatile." 
</P>
<P>
When he first contacted police, Razo asked for a helicopter ride. Then, while 
in a police car on the way to the station, he asked if they could stop at a 
friend's house to pick up "a joint." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Razo told police that "God has sent me to change this world" and other 
seemingly irrational statements. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans dismissed Razo's religious statements 
-- which included a claim that Satan was interfering with his phone calls to 
police -- as relatively "tame" and suggested that Razo might have feigned his 
bizarre behavior after confessing to the robberies. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure he's rather brilliant," Evans said. "It seems like he knows what he 
was doing." 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge Arthur D. Guy Jr. ruled that Razo's statements were made 
voluntarily and were admissible. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor now on the case, Deputy Dist. Atty. Ravi Mehta, says that he 
fully expects Barnett to attack the confession in every way imaginable -- and 
then, if it is once again ruled admissible, to drop the not-guilty plea and try 
to negotiate a reduced sentence for Razo. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Too Much to Lose 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really expect this case to go to trial," Mehta said. "He's just got 
too much to lose." 
</P>
<P>
Barnett declined to respond directly to Mehta's prediction that the defense 
will eventually plead guilty in the case in exchange for a reduced sentence. 
</P>
<P>
In a case settlement discussion last March, however, Razo's former defense 
attorney seemed to say essentially the same thing as Mehta. Egar told Superior 
Court Judge Myron Brown that if Razo's statements to La Habra police are 
admitted during the trial, "the D.A. cannot lose this case." 
</P>
<P>
Egar argued that because of Razo's exemplary background and the intense 
pressure he was under at Harvard, he should not serve more than 4 years in 
prison. Mehta termed the request "ridiculous" and instead asked for a 10-year 
sentence, pointing out that Razo faces a maximum prison sentence of more than 
20 years for the multiple robberies if he was convicted in a trial. 
</P>
<P>
Brown offered Razo a 7-year sentence, but he turned the deal down. Egar would 
not comment on any aspect of the case. 
</P>
<P>
Razo spent a total of 16 months in Orange County Jail before friends and 
relatives were able to secure his release on $150,000 bail pending his two 
trials. 
</P>
<P>
Since he got out in November, Razo has tried to reconstruct for himself some 
semblance of a normal life. He attended his brother's football games at La 
Habra High School last fall. He works for a longtime family friend and is 
enrolled in courses at Fullerton College, said Boys' Club director Guthrie. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sobering Experience 
</P>
<P>
Razo's time in jail was a "tremendously sobering experience for him," said 
Guthrie, who sat with Razo and his parents at a couple of football games. "His 
mental attitude is very good. He seems to be somewhat quiet, subdued, very 
aware of what's going on in the world around him. 
</P>
<P>
"He realizes he's been through some rough times. . . . I think he's hopeful 
that it (the trial) will come out in the best possible way for him," Guthrie 
said, adding that exactly what that would be is "hard to define." 
</P>
<P>
"He wants to get it over with," Guthrie said. 
</P>
<P>
Guthrie says the Boys' Club has made a conscious decision "not to abandon" 
Razo.

INTERIOR DESIGN FIRMS FINALLY COME OF AGE IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Lorna and Howard Hitchcock wanted a change. Their Fullerton home was dated, and 
they were looking for a new place at the beach. After months of house-hunting, 
they gave up, realizing they would never find the perfect property -- one that 
needed no work and approximated their nearly 1-acre yard. But they still 
weren't happy with a home that hadn't been redecorated in nearly two decades. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the Corona del Mar couple with the antique-filled, 5-story, 
ocean-view house. They had built it themselves and lived there for more than a 
decade. As traffic in Orange County worsened during that time, they found 
themselves entertaining more at home instead of going out. And the house needed 
a face lift. 
</P>
<P>
And there was the young professional woman with a new condominium in the 
northern part of the county whose friend had arranged the bargain of the 
century: several thousand dollars worth of pricey floral fabric for a fraction 
of the regular price. The cloth became drapes, and the drapes took over the 
room. 
</P>
<P>
Three families, three problems, one solution: They all hired a designer and 
will soon be living tastefully ever after. 
</P>
<P>
It is probably a good thing that these calamities didn't strike sooner. While 
the Orange County interior design field is considered fully matured today, it 
was still suffering through adolescence as recently as 5 years ago, local 
design experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"Four to 5 years ago, there was nothing here," said Scott L. Brown, who 
operates J.S. Brown Design in Corona del Mar with his mother, June D. Brown. 
"We had to travel to Los Angeles, Dallas, New York for furniture, fabrics, 
antiques and art." 
</P>
<P>
While it still sometimes pays to travel to the far reaches to find that perfect 
accessory, most interior designers say there really is little reason to leave 
the confines of the county. Today, nearly everything a designer could desire is 
here. 
</P>
<P>
The credit for the county's swift design growth goes in part to Design Center 
South, a 240,000-square-foot complex in Laguna Niguel. The 4-year-old design 
center houses 70 showrooms, which include such large fabric lines as 
Brunschwig, Et Fils, Stroheim and Schumacher. 
</P>
<P>
It is home to furniture from around the world, carpeting and rug showrooms and 
lighting displays. Designers can also get antiques and accessories at the 
center, which does not sell to the general public. And an 80,000-square-foot 
addition is in the works. Local designers can also find supplies at the South 
Coast Design Center in Costa Mesa, which has 22 showrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"I would definitely say that there's no need to go to Los Angeles anymore," 
said designer Abby Menhenett, also of Corona del Mar. Whatever is available 
there can be found here, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Including clients. Orange County's rapid growth and enduring affluence -- the 
1988 median family income was $45,000, well above the national figure of 
$29,000 -- has swelled the ranks of interior designers. In the early 1960s, 
there were only a few here; today, the county boasts more than 300 members of 
the American Society of Interior Designers. 
</P>
<P>
(ASID membership is a safeguard for consumers because it means the designer has 
passed an examination and served a 5-year apprenticeship.) 
</P>
<P>
Orange County clients range from young, first-time condominium owners with very 
fixed budgets all the way to the wealthy. Menhenett said she considers them 
"real sophisticated": well-traveled, well-educated, well-informed. 
</P>
<P>
"They definitely want quality," she said of her customers. "They're defining 
their own sense of what their nest should look like." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, designers contend that residents can't do it alone, and that 
everyone needs their services. To a certain extent, they are right. 
</P>
<P>
Dorian Hunter, a designer who has practiced in Fullerton for nearly 30 years, 
saw evidence of this need as recently as 3 weeks ago -- it was Hunter who got 
the call of the colorful curtains. 
</P>
<P>
The floral drapes in question might have been a bargain, Hunter said, but they 
quickly turned into a quandary for their owner. Until the young client was left 
with yards and yards of powerful pattern dominating her small space, she hadn't 
really thought about whether she was even fond of flowers. 
</P>
<P>
What is she going to do? Hunter is working on that problem now. What she should 
have done was call for help first and decide to buy later, Hunter said. The 
designer compares her work to that of the accountant who fills out your tax 
forms: The accountant knows the rules and how to solve the problems; so does 
the designer. 
</P>
<P>
And that saves customers money and time. For while designers' fees here range 
from $50 to $100 per hour -- above and beyond furniture and supplies -- one of 
their main tasks is to keep clients from making costly errors. 
</P>
<P>
"People just starting out need a direction and a plan," Brown said. "They can 
take a 5- or 10-year plan and put it into effect as they are able to afford it. 
And people who are filthy rich need someone to curb their spending habits" so 
they don't over-decorate. 
</P>
<P>
So what's a plan and how much does one cost? 
</P>
<P>
A basic design plan can range from a quick sketch of a single room all the way 
up to a fully detailed drawing of every surface of every room in the home. 
</P>
<P>
Most are somewhere in-between. What a designer often will do is meet with 
clients, see their home and discover their desires and budget first. Then comes 
a furniture inventory, an assessment of what will be kept and what will be 
chucked. 
</P>
<P>
Next come the drawings: a floor plan to place furniture new and old, and 
detailed drawings of walls, wall coverings, windows and window treatments. 
Color schemes and fabric swatches can also be an integral part of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
According to a nationwide 1988 ASID survey, the average cost of a residential 
redecorating project -- including renovation of the kitchen, bathroom, living 
and dining rooms -- is $68,200. That also includes a detailed plan that could 
range, Brown said, from $5,000 to $25,000, depending on its complexity. 
</P>
<P>
But design doesn't have to be that expensive. A family with a tight budget can 
get a workable -- though less complete -- plan for $500 to $2,500, local 
designers say, and use it to steer their renovations over several years. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Titus, a Fullerton designer, considers $5,000 to be a small but possible 
design budget. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't turn down anyone," Titus said. "I have clients with $1,000, and we do 
it. I don't mind working that way." 
</P>
<P>
The key in such a project, Hunter said, is continued contact with an interior 
designer, which is an additional expense not reflected in the cost of the plan. 
Many people think they can come to a designer and get a color scheme and 
drawing and do it themselves, she said. But it's not that easy, especially 
since most furniture and fabric sources are closed to the general public. 
</P>
<P>
"You really should keep in contact with the designer, utilize the designer's 
skills over a long period of time," she said. "You have to remember that you 
spend as much on the inside of your house as you do on the outside, over time." 
</P>
<P>
And time is what it takes for a successful redesign project. 
</P>
<P>
When Claire Robinson, described by her colleagues as the doyenne of designers 
in Orange County, first descended on the 5-story antique-filled Corona del Mar 
house, it was 1987. Two years later, she is just getting to the finishing 
touches. 
</P>
<P>
The design problem facing Robinson and associate Christine Hallen-Berg was how 
to make a sophisticated antique collection reflecting years of travel fit in an 
architecturally contemporary home. 
</P>
<P>
Hallen-Berg said her clients, who declined to be named, wanted their home to 
have a "palatial" feeling. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson and Hallen-Berg achieved that look in the living room by designing 
custom furniture to complement the couple's extensive art collection. Two sofas 
of soft blue-green hue were matched with a similar color fabric for the walls. 
</P>
<P>
The room is set off by a limestone floor and ceiling fresco of clouds and 
angels rendered by a local artist. Two grand pianos grace a raised alcove off 
the room. The result is traditional and timeless, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The adjoining dining room and kitchen posed a particular problem, because the 
floor, ceiling and kitchen cabinets were dark teak. Although a wall of windows 
overlooks the ocean, the area was still gloomy, Robinson said. Her answer was 
to bleach the wood to a light gray-green. The full effect is airy, bright and 
sophisticated, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Several floors down, Robinson designed a Southwest-flavored audio-visual room, 
with a built-in bed and bar, animal-hide rugs, desert colors and a wall studded 
with televisions -- five small ones plus one large screen. 
</P>
<P>
While local design experts say that much of Orange County design has a 
traditional flair like this Robinson-designed home, another strong thread in 
local style is the airy California look: full of sunlight, bright colors and 
space. 
</P>
<P>
That's the look Scott Brown created in Lorna and Howard Hitchcock's one-story 
Fullerton home -- a far cry from its original 1960s navy and lime-green 
interior. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very creative," Lorna Hitchcock said. "We have a very contemporary 
look." 
</P>
<P>
Brown had the patio area enclosed with glass to create an 11-by-28-foot 
solarium, which the Hitchcocks use for family gatherings and entertaining. At 
the center of the solarium is a coffee table made simply of stacked slabs of 
Arizona sandstone in subtle salmon shades. Clustered around the coffee table 
are over-sized chairs covered in a heavy, hand-woven fabric of salmon and 
beige. Brown had a sand-colored banquette built, and accented it with painted 
canvas pillows in soft desert colors. He also added a granite bar with 
high-legged, low-backed chairs. 
</P>
<P>
Designer Lisa Dunlevie is achieving a similar California look in a Newport 
Beach home she and partner Abby Menhenett are gradually renovating over a 
period of years. The one-story home, spacious and airy and designed for casual 
entertaining, exemplifies the American return to the home as the center of 
family life. 
</P>
<P>
"The house represents a current California design trend with Orange County at 
the pinnacle," Menhenett said. With lots of windows, and French doors in the 
dining room providing a view of the garden and swimming pool, "it is open, 
connected with the outdoors," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Dunlevie, the project's primary designer, stressed natural materials and 
colors, bright accents, custom furniture and quality contemporary art. For the 
dining room, Dunlevie created a 600-pound limestone table with chairs 
upholstered in shrunken buffalo hide. A handcrafted pewter mirror graces the 
entryway. 
</P>
<P>
This California look, while out of place nearly everywhere else, is a real 
problem-solver for Orange County residents. Its airy quality fits the county's 
sun-drenched environment, and it is versatile enough to suit life styles from 
the laid-back to the sophisticated.

When Michelle and Ken Browe moved to Orange County from Michigan 5 years ago, 
they knew they were saying goodby to winter as they knew it. They just didn't 
expect to give up spring in the bargain. 
</P>
<P>
For Michelle, spring meant flowers -- a bright burst of color after a long 
siege of muted gray, white and brown. But here it's the seasonal changes that 
are muted, not the hues, with floral fireworks exploding into bloom year-round. 
It may be beautiful, but somehow it's not quite the same. 
</P>
<P>
"The first couple of springs here didn't feel like spring to us," she says. "It 
took some time to adjust." 
</P>
<P>
But this year, even without snowdrifts, it has felt like winter to the Rancho 
Santa Margarita couple. Maybe it was the frost that attacked their neighbor's 
hibiscus, or those stretches of chilly, cloudy days in January and February. Or 
maybe they've just become Southern Californians at last. In any case, by 
mid-February they were anxious for a real spring, flowers and all. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was growing up (in Michigan), my parents planted flowers a lot," 
Michelle says. "Every spring we had to start over again." From the time she was 
about 8 years old, Michelle would help, digging holes for the plants and 
watering. "My parents were always really good about hands-on learning." 
</P>
<P>
This year the Browes decided to start over for spring in the family tradition. 
Their last major planting had been about 18 months earlier, and "it was 
starting to look pretty bad," Ken says. 
</P>
<P>
Whether they're back-Easties or native Californians, plenty of Orange County 
residents get the urge to garden long about now, says Gina Royalty of 
Nurseryland in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
"There aren't really any times that you can't plant around here," says Royalty, 
an Advanced California Certified Nurseryperson who helped the Browes plan their 
spring garden. "A lot of people plant prior to the big holidays -- 
Thanksgiving, Christmas -- because they know they're going to have lots of 
guests coming by. But it gets to be a fever going into spring." 
</P>
<P>
The overwhelming year-round display of color in professionally landscaped areas 
tends to give some aspiring green thumbs the wrong idea, Royalty says. "They 
see the flowers at places like Disneyland or the Ritz-Carlton, where they use 
thousands of plants a month, and they expect that their yard is going to look 
like that. We have to convince them to be realistic so they won't be 
disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
"Most people expect too much out of their plants," Royalty says. "They want 
plants that will give them maximum color and will go on forever." Even in 
Orange County's eternal spring, that just doesn't happen, she says. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually you have to plant about three times a year to get good results," 
Royalty says. "To get ongoing color, you plant in the fall, October or 
November, then again about now, and then again in early summer, June or July. 
That's not absolute, but you just have to rotate. Plants get tired. You have to 
pull them out and replace them." 
</P>
<P>
For the Browes, it wasn't so much a matter of expecting the old flowers to last 
forever as simply lack of time to replace them. With two children, Kenneth, 5, 
and Ashleigh, 3, and both Ken and Michelle working full time, other things just 
had to come first. 
</P>
<P>
But between Michelle's garden-oriented upbringing and the couple's experience 
with previous plantings at their current house and a former residence in 
Mission Viejo, the Browes did have a realistic idea of the amount of effort and 
time involved. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran do-it-yourselfers, they landscaped both yards themselves from scratch. 
"We asked a lot of questions at the nursery and the hardware store," Ken says. 
</P>
<P>
"And we learned a lot of things the hard way," says Michelle. 
</P>
<P>
They weren't surprised when Royalty told them that in addition to the flowers, 
they would need planting mix and fertilizer to keep them healthy. 
</P>
<P>
"The ground is so terrible here," Michelle says. "When we were getting our lawn 
ready for sod, we had to rent a jackhammer to loosen it. It was so hard that 
the rental places wouldn't let people use rototillers because too many of them 
were coming back damaged. The sound of jackhammers rang from dawn to dusk every 
weekend here for months." 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the county's soil might not be quite as bad as Rancho Santa 
Margarita's, but in general, Royalty says, soil in the county tends to be a 
heavy clay that must be amended to give roots room to breathe. She recommends 
using a mix of "50% planter mix and 50% soil, at a minimum. And it helps to dig 
in some gypsum too." 
</P>
<P>
Because the Browes had planted before, they had a head start on their soil 
quality. "If you've replanted a lot, you can go a little lighter. Every time, 
your soil will gradually get better," Royalty says. 
</P>
<P>
In planning their planting, the Browes were careful to avoid one mistake they 
had made before. "The first couple of times we didn't take the sun into 
account," Michelle says. "We put plants in the shade that should have been in 
the sun, and it just didn't work." 
</P>
<P>
That's one of the most common mistakes, Royalty says. "When we're advising our 
customers, we really like to know what kind of exposure they're planting. And 
some of them don't know. They really haven't looked at the area that closely." 
</P>
<P>
And because the sun's angle changes with the seasons, it helps to know if an 
area that is in shade in March will be in full sun most of the day by July. 
</P>
<P>
Plants also need to get along with their neighbors, Royalty says. Don't put 
flowers that need frequent watering alongside those that require a drier soil 
because one will suffer no matter what you do. 
</P>
<P>
With Royalty's help, Michelle chose plants for a rectangular planter area under 
the front window and an irregularly shaped area bounded by a fence, the house, 
the lawn and the curb. The planting areas total about 100 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Ken was content to keep track of the children while Michelle made the choices. 
"She's very creative about that sort of thing, so I just leave it to her," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
They decided on a border of white, ground-hugging alyssum for the irregular 
area, surrounding a planting of purple pansies and multicolor Iceland poppies. 
For the area in front of the fence, Michelle chose variegated pink and purple 
primroses, with a star jasmine vine trained to climb the fence itself. And for 
the middle of the planting, Michelle chose three pink breath of heaven plants. 
</P>
<P>
In the rectangular area by the window, she decided on a mixture of azalea 
bushes, impatiens and primroses. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle's selections included a mixture of annuals, such as the pansies and 
poppies, and perennials, such as the impatiens and azaleas. Royalty says there 
are advantages and disadvantages to both. "Perennials will come back year after 
year, not indefinitely, but for 2 or 3 years at least. Annuals last only a 
season. They have more color right now, but it's going to be over within a few 
months." 
</P>
<P>
Michelle's family tradition calls for planting early in the morning, to reduce 
the shock of midday sun on newly transplanted flowers. Royalty says late 
afternoon can be another good time to plant. 
</P>
<P>
And always dig the holes twice as big as the size of the plant, so you can put 
enough good soil inside the hole. That's especially important with plants such 
as azaleas, which need even more soil amendment than most, Royalty says. 
</P>
<P>
The Browes have a system with their gardening: She does the planning, and he 
digs the holes. 
</P>
<P>
It's important to gently break up the dirt surrounding the roots of a bedding 
plant, Royalty says. "And don't plant them too deep. You want it to be at the 
same level it was when you bought it. Don't bury the little crown too deep." 
</P>
<P>
While Michelle and Ken planted, Kenneth and Ashleigh did their best to help. 
Kenneth took a pack of primroses and planted three of them himself while his 
parents weren't looking. 
</P>
<P>
"He felt so proud," Michelle says. "Of course, we had to replant them." 
</P>
<P>
Ashleigh, meanwhile, helped by making mud pies and carrying the packs of 
alyssum the few steps from the car to the curb. 
</P>
<P>
After planting -- the Browes finished the job in about 4 hours -- it's 
important to water the new garden well, Royalty says. After that, frequent 
watering is important, especially until the plants have rooted out into the 
ground. Later, the plants still need water, although Royalty says most people 
make the mistake of watering too much. 
</P>
<P>
As the flowers bloom and die, Royalty says, it's important to pick off the old 
flowers so the plants will use their energy to produce more flowers rather than 
going to seed. 
</P>
<P>
"And on plants like the azaleas, you have to do a lot of pruning," Michelle 
says. "I know that's hard at first because you want things to grow. But if you 
want it to be the way you planned it, you have to keep it under control." 
</P>

Donna Barasch, a Villa Park cooking instructor, stresses fresh ingredients in 
her spring menus, which she likes to prepare for daytime gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
Following are her original recipes for a Sunday afternoon "dinner" with a 
spring theme. The menu is built around lamb with herbs, new peas, fresh 
strawberries and an assortment of decorative touches (for information on her 
classes featuring these dishes and others, call (714) 997-3369). 
</P>
<P>
To complement the meal, husband Ken Barasch, whose hobby is wine collecting, 
recommends a French Burgundy such as DRC Aa Tache or a California pinot noir 
such as 1984 Carneros Saintsbury or 1984 Tulocay.

BUTTER LAMB SCULPTURE 
</P>
<P>
Ingredients 
</P>
<P>
1 pound butter 
</P>
<P>
2 whole cloves 
</P>
<P>
Preparation 
</P>
<P>
Place a 1/4-pound stick of butter on serving plate. 
</P>
<P>
Cut another stick of butter in half. With a knife, round off one end of one of 
the 1/2 sticks to make the lamb face, then smooth. Run a hot knife along the 
underside of that 1/2 stick and attach it to the front top of the whole stick, 
with the face extending beyond the bottom stick. 
</P>
<P>
Cut another stick into about 12 pieces. One by one, place small pieces in bowl 
of garlic press and squeeze out about 1/4-inch of "wool." Run a sharp knife 
across the face of the garlic press to pick up "wool" and place it along the 
lower edge of the large stick that is being used for the lamb body. Repeat the 
process with the remaining butter. Keep adding "wool," covering entire lamb, 
except for the smooth face. Always work from the bottom to the top. Cut off and 
discard the large end of the cloves and press remaining thin part into the 
lamb's face for eyes. Chill until ready to serve. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SPRING LEG OF LAMB 
</P>

POTATO BASKETS WITH FRESH GREEN PEAS AND CARROTS 
</P>
<P>
Ingredients 
</P>
<P>
Baskets 
</P>
<P>
1 package frozen hash brown potatoes, defrosted and drained of excess water. 
</P>
<P>
Cooking oil 
</P>
<P>
Filling 
</P>
<P>
2 pounds fresh green peas, in shells 
</P>
<P>
1/2 pound fresh carrots 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon butter 
</P>
<P>
Salt and pepper to taste 
</P>
<P>
Preparation 
</P>
<P>
Preparation 
</P>
<P>
To cook, you will need two small (less than 6 inches in diameter) wire fry 
baskets, one slightly larger than the other. Preheat deep fryer with vegetable 
oil deep enough to cover wire fry baskets. Break apart a potato patty and 
lightly place shreds in outer wire basket, spreading up the sides. Place other 
wire basket in center of first basket so the potato basket will hold its shape. 
Holding both baskets together, place in hot oil. Cook until potatoes just start 
to turn color, then gently remove inner basket. Continue cooking potatoes until 
browned; remove from oil. Turn basket upside down on paper towels. Gently knock 
off shreds that protrude through basket wires. Potato basket should drop onto 
towels. Repeat with remaining potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
Shell peas. Peel and dice carrots. Boil separately in salted water until barely 
tender. This may be done several hours ahead. Just before serving, melt butter 
in sauce pan, add vegetables and heat. Salt and pepper to taste. Serve in 
potato baskets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MERINGUE BASKETS WITH STRAWBERRIES 
</P>
<P>
Ingredients 
</P>
<P>
1 cup egg whites (need about 8 eggs) 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar 
</P>
<P>
2 cups sugar 
</P>
<P>
2 pints fresh strawberries 
</P>
<P>
Preparation 
</P>
<P>
In a large mixing bowl, combine egg whites with cream of tartar at medium speed 
until frothy. Turn to high speed and gradually add sugar. Beat until stiff and 
glossy. Place 1/2 of the meringue mixture in a pastry bag with medium tip. 
</P>
<P>
On parchment paper on a baking sheet, draw 8 4-inch circles. Pipe a layer of 
meringue to completely cover the outline of the circle and continue to pipe 
progressively smaller concentric circles inside the original circle to make a 
disk. 
</P>
<P>
On another baking sheet covered with parchment, draw more 4-inch circles. You 
will need 24. Pipe a single line of meringue around the circumference of each 
circle. Bake the disks and circles 1 1/2 hours at 200 degrees. (Refill pastry 
bag as needed.) 
</P>
<P>
When disks and circles are cooked, gently remove from baking sheet. On each 
disk, pipe a circle of meringue on the top of the outer edge. Place a baked 
meringue circle on top of the freshly-piped meringue. Repeat 2 more times until 
you have a disk with 3 rings attached. To complete the basket appearance, on 
the outside of the basket pipe a line of the meringue mixture from the bottom 
disk to the top circle spaced every inch around the basket. Repeat for 
remaining disks. Place baskets on parchment paper on baking sheet. Bake at 200 
degrees for 1 1/2 hours. Cool. 
</P>
<P>
Clean strawberries. Place in baskets just before serving. 
</P>
<P>
If weather is damp, serve the same day. If weather is dry, you can make 
meringue baskets the day before. In either case, store in airtight container 
until time to serve. KAREN NEWELL YOUNG

WARMER DAYS AHEAD WILL HEAT UP BUG PROBLEMS INSIDE HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Spring is on the way, and for sun-worshiping Southern California that means 
longer, warmer days -- and more bugs. 
</P>
<P>
"Insects, being cold-blooded animals, are pretty much dictated to by the 
temperatures," said Fred Beams, assistant manager of the Orange County Vector 
Control District. "Generally speaking, as the ground warms up and the air warms 
up, insects get more active, and they're a lot more likely to come into the 
house." 
</P>
<P>
Leading the warm-weather invasion, especially for pet owners, are fleas. The 
tiny insects cannot breed or survive without human or animal blood, so it 
doesn't take long for owners of flea-infested homes to feel their presence. 
Fleas will bite humans in addition to domestic animals. 
</P>
<P>
Warm weather can also signal an open-house invitation to ants, carpet beetles, 
crickets, silverfish and roaches. In fact, the Vector Control folks distribute 
pest control bulletins detailing more than 20 critters that commonly plague 
county residents. (The bulletins may be obtained by calling the district at 
(714) 971-2421.) 
</P>
<P>
There are a few general measures that besieged homeowners can take in 
anticipation of the warm days ahead. Checking to see if all screens are in good 
repair is a good step, as is making sure to keep all unscreened doors and 
windows closed. 
</P>
<P>
Cleanliness is an important safeguard, especially in the kitchen. All food 
products should be securely stored, and counters should be kept clean of crumbs 
and other food residue that might attract pests. Pet owners should be careful 
to regularly vacuum areas frequented by their animals. 
</P>
<P>
Pesticides can be helpful in the fight against specific pest problems, but 
users should exercise caution. First, the label should be read carefully before 
purchase to make sure the pesticide works on the targeted pest (different 
chemicals work on different bugs). 
</P>
<P>
Instructions should be followed to the letter. Misuse of pesticides is not only 
unsafe but can be counterproductive. If too much is used, for example, "you're 
much more likely to develop a resistance in the insects you're trying to 
eliminate," Beams said. 
</P>
<P>
The Vector Control District also advises insecticide users to take these 
precautions: Do not use insecticides around an open flame or exposed foods; 
clean food preparation areas after the use of pesticides; store out of reach of 
children and pets, preferably in locked cabinets; never keep pesticides in 
anything other than the original container, and never reuse the pesticide 
container to store other materials. 
</P>
<P>
For large problems, professional help might be in order. Vector Control 
District officials will provide free advice over the phone and will go out to 
homes when a pest poses a potential health threat. And many private pest 
control services operate in Orange County, as a glance through the Yellow Pages 
will show. 
</P>
<P>
For exterminators, business heats up along with the weather. But extermination 
services are not only a measure of last resort; most companies offer regular 
maintenance programs to keep specific pests in check. 
</P>
<P>
Following is a list of indoor pests common to the county, and some suggestions 
from the Orange County Vector Control District on how to keep problems at a 
minimum: 
</P>
<P>
* Fleas: The female flea lays her eggs on pets; the eggs often fall off and 
hatch in carpets and other places where the pet spends time indoors. If carpets 
are not regularly vacuumed, a home may become infested with developing larvae 
before the infestation is noticed. 
</P>
<P>
If fleas appear in the home, thoroughly vacuum infested rooms, including 
carpets, rugs and upholstered furniture, and mop uncarpeted areas with a hot 
soap solution. Fleas can be controlled indoors with several pesticides 
available at retail stores. Be certain that the solution is non-staining if it 
is to be used on carpets or fabrics. Treat outside areas where the animal runs 
or sleeps with sprays of malathion, Sevin, diazinon or Dursban. Cleaning and 
spraying should be coordinated with flea dips for pets. 
</P>
<P>
* Silverfish: These hardy insects prefer warm, damp, dark places and feed on 
vegetable matter with a high starch or sugar content, which can include paper 
and some fabrics. To prevent breeding of these pests, dry out locations that 
foster their development. Regularly air out and sun stored blankets and 
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
Solutions such as Ronnel and Dursban can be effective when sprayed on infested 
surfaces, including attics and basements, closets, baseboards, the shelves and 
back walls of cabinets and bookcases, under sinks and in holes where pipes pass 
through walls and floors. 
</P>
<P>
* Carpet beetles: The larvae of these pests feed on anything that contains 
feathers, wool or fur -- and have even developed a taste for many man-made 
fibers. The larvae are about one-quarter-inch long, elongated and have brownish 
to black bristles that give them a gray or golden fuzzy appearance. As they 
develop, they cast off their skins, and this small, fuzzy case is the first 
sign of an infestation. 
</P>
<P>
Regular vacuuming is the best safeguard against potential infestation, 
especially in hard-to-reach places such as near the wall. Woolen scraps, 
pennants or garments that lie for long periods of time may be sources of 
infestation and should be stored with treated paper. Fumigation may be needed 
in severe cases of infestation. 
</P>
<P>
* Crickets: Although they usually breed outdoors in uncultivated areas, 
crickets can become a problem if a nearby vacant lot has been disturbed. They 
can be a nuisance because of their noise, and because they sometimes chew 
soiled fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
Seal off cricket entryways by tightening screens and weather-stripping doors 
and windows. Dusts or sprays can be applied to cracks and other hiding places. 
Aerosols containing Pyrethrum and silica aerogel drying powder are the safest 
to use indoors. 
</P>
<P>
* Ants: Although they do not carry disease, ants in the home can be an 
annoyance. They often get into food supplies, some preferring sweet substances 
and others feeding on grease. 
</P>
<P>
Locate the ants' nest, if possible, and treat with insecticide. Also treat all 
cracks or openings ants use to get into the house. It is best if the ants are 
controlled in the spring months before their populations increase. 
</P>
<P>
* Cockroaches: Oriental cockroaches are secretive, preferring dark, cool, damp 
areas such as water meter boxes and dense vegetation along curbsides or 
foundations. Occasionally they are found in the home, often in the bathtub or 
shower. This does not mean the home is infested. More likely, it is the result 
of the roach searching for food away from its nesting area. 
</P>
<P>
Prevention and control of cockroaches require elimination of food sources, 
which may include pet food, spilled garbage containers or trash cans in poor 
condition. Piles of lumber or other debris may also provide hiding places for 
roaches, so general yard cleanup should be performed regularly. It may also be 
necessary to apply insecticides in places where they breed, such as around the 
house foundation and nearby thick vegetation. Suitable pesticides include 
diazinon, Baygon or Dursban. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMON HOUSEHOLD PESTS 
</P>
<P>
FLEAS 
</P>
<P>
Description: Tiny, oval, biting insects that lay eggs on pets. Blood of hosts 
is needed for viable eggs. 
</P>
<P>
Habitat: Can live inside or outside home. 
</P>
<P>
Problem: Eggs often fall into carpets, where they can hatch and infest the 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Prevention: Regularly vacuum or mop areas frequented by pets. Flea-dip pets 
when warm weather approaches. 
</P>
<P>
ANTS 
</P>
<P>
Description: Adults vary in size, are generally wingless. Abdomen is restricted 
(thin-waisted), unlike termites, which are broadly joined at thorax. 
</P>
<P>
Habitat: Social insects found in nests or colonies in open ground, under 
stones, in wood, etc. 
</P>
<P>
Problem: Often enter house in warm weather, can get into food supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Prevention: If ants appear, treat openings by which they enter home with 
insecticide. Find nest if possible and treat also. 
</P>
<P>
CARPET BEETLES 
</P>
<P>
Description: Larvae become one-quarter inch long, elongated or oval in shape, 
have brownish to black bristles. Adult is slightly bigger, broadly oval, and 
dark; mottled with white, yellow, brown or black. 
</P>
<P>
Habitat: Damaging larvae can be found in carpets, especially along walls and 
under furniture, and in dark areas of drawers, closets and cupboards. 
</P>
<P>
Problem: Feed on animal hair and man-made fibers. 
</P>
<P>
Prevention: Regular vacuuming is best safeguard. Woolens and other fabrics

SOMETIMES A DECK IS BETTER THAN A PATIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A deck, in Southern California home improvement parlance, most often is a 
redwood structure hanging off the second floor of a home or cantilevered out 
over a hillside. 
</P>
<P>
A patio, on the other hand, usually is a flat concrete slab at ground level. 
</P>
<P>
But it doesn't have to be so. 
</P>
<P>
A deck can be built just about anywhere a patio can be poured, and the warmth 
and texture of wood, combined with its relatively easy maintenance, makes a 
wonderful replacement for concrete. 
</P>
<P>
And for the do-it-yourselfer, a ground-level deck isn't all that difficult or 
expensive to build. 
</P>
<P>
When Michael and Lois Mirkovich moved from a tiny Balboa Island apartment to a 
1,200-square-foot condominium in Irvine's University Town Center, creating an 
outdoor area was a priority. They wanted to extend their space for 
entertaining, exercising and relaxing, and provide a clean, safe place for 
their son, Adam, to play. 
</P>
<P>
The two-bedroom condo had only a small rear yard -- no hillsides and no 
upstairs family room to give access to a second-floor deck. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Mirkovichs, neither of whom was enamored with concrete, decided to 
install a wooden deck. They just put it where most people put a patio. 
</P>
<P>
The result, after six weekends of work: a beautiful herringbone-patterned 
redwood deck-cum-patio, fitted neatly into a pocket of yard framed on three 
sides -- by the window wall of the living room, the sliding glass doors of the 
dining room and the stucco fence that separates the Mirkovichs' back yard from 
the neighbor's. The deck extends out an additional 6 feet into the main portion 
of the rear yard, giving it an overall dimension of 12-by-16 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Mirkovich, an attorney, decided to tackle the project himself because 
he enjoys working with his hands. 
</P>
<P>
He had learned construction skills when, after graduating from UC Santa Barbara 
with a master's degree in social ecology, he was recruited to play water polo 
in Australia for the University of Queensland club team in 1976-77. "I played 
water polo for free," he recalls. "They got me a construction job to pay the 
bills." 
</P>
<P>
But almost anyone who can swing a hammer and handle a power saw can follow the 
Mirkovichs' example and build a lasting and good-looking ground-level deck. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-by-16-foot deck described below will cost between $1,000 and $1,200 to 
build yourself, which is competitive with the cost of hiring a contractor to 
put in a standard concrete patio. "And aesthetically, it is so much nicer," 
Mirkovich says. 
</P>
<P>
Not only do the wide, "V"-shaped herringbone pattern and the warm reddish color 
of the wood give the deck a level of character that few concrete patios can 
match, it also wears well. 
</P>
<P>
Wood doesn't crack or chip at the edges like concrete. And Mirkovich avoided a 
common deck maintenance problem by refraining from painting or staining the 
deck. Instead, he applied clear water seal to each board before fitting the 
pieces together. All he does to keep the decking looking its best is to swab on 
a new coat of water seal every 6 months -- a process that takes less than 2 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
To keep the deck level with the floor of the house and still avoid the rotting 
and warping that will occur if wood is placed directly in contact with the 
earth, Mirkovich built it on a series of prefab concrete piers with mounting 
brackets for 4-by-4s. After installing the piers, he laid a layer of plastic 
sheeting on the ground to keep weeds from growing and to serve as a moisture 
barrier. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid attaching the deck to the house so there would be no building code 
problems and no chance of water running indoors, Mirkovich built it as a 
free-standing structure. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how you can do it: 
</P>
<P>
(Because building codes differ from city to city and the characteristics of 
each project can vary widely, use these instructions only as a guide, making 
sure your project complies with your local building codes.) 
</P>
<P>
The Foundation 
</P>
<P>
1. Instead of fastening a portion of the framing to the walls or foundation of 
your house, install prefab piers so that the mounting brackets are about 4 
inches from the wall. Set them so only an inch remains above ground. If your 
lot slopes, adjust the depth at which the piers are buried so the exposed tops 
are level. The distance between piers should be 5 to 6 feet. A line level, 
attached to a length of heavy string that is fixed to the house at floor level, 
is the best device for leveling the piers. A slight slope away from the house 
will keep rain water from running inside. 
</P>
<P>
2. Cut treated fir 4-by-4s to the appropriate length. Measure the distance 
between the ground and the level of your home's floor, subtract the 1 1/2-inch 
thickness of the decking boards and the distance the piers extend above ground 
level. 
</P>
<P>
3. Fit the 4-by-4 posts into the mounting brackets on the piers, mark the bolt 
holes and drill through with a 3/8-inch wood bit. Bolt posts to brackets with 
3/8-by-3 1/2-inch lag bolts, making sure they are straight and level. (If you 
taper the top of each post about 30 degrees, it will shed water. Coating the 
bottoms with roofing tar will further protect against water damage.) 
</P>
<P>
The Framing 
</P>
<P>
1. Cut treated fir 2-by-6s to length for main joists. For a 12-by-16-foot deck, 
Mirkovich used 16-foot joists. Cut a single joist for each outside row of piers 
and two joists for each interior row. 
</P>
<P>
2. Mount joists, tops level with the tops of the 4-by-4 posts. Tack in place 
with 16-penny galvanized nails. Exterior joists go on the outside of the piers 
(if you have a row of piers against the house or fence, the 4-inch space you 
left will give you plenty of room to slip the joist between the wall and the 
4-by-4 post). Interior joists are fastened to each side of the mounting posts, 
parallel to the exterior joists. 
</P>
<P>
3. Drill two slightly staggered 3/8-inch holes through each joist and support 
post. Fasten single joists to the posts with 3/8-by-5 1/2-inch lag bolts. Use 
3/8-by-7 1/2-inch lag bolts for the paired joists. 
</P>
<P>
4. Measure and cut treated 2-by-6 cross pieces to fit between the joists. 
</P>
<P>
5. For maximum strength, fasten them on 10- to 12-inch centers using galvanized 
joist hangers and 16-penny galvanized nails. Make sure the tops are flush with 
the tops of the joists. If the cross pieces are lower than the joist tops, the 
decking will sag; if higher, the ends of the decking won't nail down solidly 
and will tend to split. 
</P>
<P>
The Decking 
</P>
<P>
Use select grade redwood for best results. 
</P>
<P>
For a simple "V"-shaped herringbone pattern, cutting the ends of the boards at 
a 60-degree angle looks best. Decking can be run out to the edges of the deck, 
so the ends of each board are visible. Or, as Mirkovich did, decking can be 
framed, like a picture, to hide the board ends and give the deck a more formal 
look. Framing the deck, however, makes the cutting more involved and requires 
extra joists and cross pieces, and won't be dealt with in these instructions. 
</P>
<P>
Use a hollow-ground planing blade in your saw to minimize splintering and keep 
edges smooth. 
</P>
<P>
Coat each board with water seal and allow to dry before cutting. 
</P>
<P>
Then follow these steps: 
</P>
<P>
1. For the first side of the "V," lay a piece of untrimmed decking across the 
joists, adjust it to the proper angle with the ends overhanging the side and 
center joists, and nail it down with 10-penny galvanized finishing nails. Then 
nail each successive board in place, leaving a 1/8-inch gap between each for 
drainage and circulation (make a spacer from scrap 1/8-inch plywood or 
hardboard). 
</P>
<P>
2. Using a long straightedge or chalk line, mark the ends of the boards 
parallel with the outside edges of the joists. You can trim the decking flush 
with the exterior joist or allow it to overhang a bit, but you must add 2 
inches to the inside edge to allow for the space between the paired interior 
joists. 
</P>
<P>
3. Trim edges along the lines you've made. 
</P>
<P>
4. Coat the cut ends with water seal. 
</P>
<P>
5. To cut boards for the opposite leg of the "V" design, use a cutting jig to 
trim one end of each board. (To make the jig, use a 2-by-4 about 2 feet long 
and glue and bolt a 1-foot section to it at the proper angle -- 60 degrees is 
suggested, but it can vary according to individual tastes. Then you can lay the 
straightedge of the jig along the edge of each piece of decking and use the 
angled piece to guide your power saw. A rigid, moveable jig ensures that the 
angles you cut don't vary -- which is of critical importance in setting a 
herringbone pattern.) 
</P>
<P>
6. Coat the trimmed ends with water seal, then butt them against the inside 
edges of the first course of decking to form the point of each "V." Let the 
untrimmed edge of each board hang over the side. Nail boards into place, with 
1/8-inch spacing. 
</P>
<P>
7. Trim outside edge as described in No. 2 above and coat remaining exposed 
ends with water seal. 
</P>
<P>
8. Nail a 2-by-6 across the exposed joist ends to serve as a facing board for 
the edge of the deck that juts out into the yard. 
</P>
<P>
It takes time, and you'll likely end up with a mashed finger or two and more 
than a few splinters, but the end result is well worth it. 
</P>
<P>
The Mirkovichs have found that their deck enables them to entertain friends 
without feeling crowded. In other words, building it enabled Michael Mirkovich 
to add about 176 square feet of living space to his condo at far less expense 
than adding a room. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Following fashion is fine when you're buying a wardrobe, but it can be risky 
business when it comes to furniture shopping. After all, it's tougher to return 
an armoire than an overcoat -- and much more money is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
"Home design is such a big investment that it's ridiculous to be trendy. It's 
not a seasonal purchase," says Dorian Hunter, a Fullerton interior designer. 
</P>
<P>
So here are some guidelines, a kind of quick "What's In and What's Out" from 
Orange County interior designers Hunter, Scott Brown, Jason Titus and Lisa 
Weber. 
</P>
<P>
First, there's Hunter on lamps: "Unless you want a decorative look, like a 
piece of art, lamps are outdated." To Hunter, a lamp looks like a vase with a 
fedora, kind of odd and unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
But what do you do if you want to sit in your living room and, say, read a 
book? Modern technology has brought the design field a multitude of lighting 
solutions, Hunter says. And chief among them is good-quality track lighting. 
</P>
<P>
Remember the Southwest look? Brown, a Corona del Mar designer, and Weber, who 
operates out of Fullerton, agree that the chunky log furniture that graces 
Southern California department stores never worked, even when it was new. In 
their eyes, faux cactus and similar Indian-printed fabrics fare about as well. 
</P>
<P>
However, says Brown, "there's nothing wrong with the real thing: ethnic art, 
slabs of real stone and woven rugs." 
</P>
<P>
Cluttered English country, that messy look straight from an Agatha Christie 
novel, is also a thing of the past. Toss those bunches of baskets, herb wreaths 
and heavy reproduction furniture, Brown says. 
</P>
<P>
"I find it difficult to deal with traditional English and French, particularly 
the country looks," Hunter says in agreement. "We're not living those kinds of 
lives. But some people buy it. To them, this overly decorated look is a 
statement that they've arrived." 
</P>
<P>
But what Brown calls "clean country" is fine. With its spare Shaker furniture, 
simple lines and local heritage, such a style will never be dated. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the high-gloss lacquer look that was favored 7 or 8 years ago as 
cutting-edge contemporary. "You still see it," Brown says with a grimace, "but 
I hope no one buys it." 
</P>
<P>
Enough said. 
</P>
<P>
Titus says he is seeing a shift in his Fullerton firm that has more to do with 
sociology than style. 
</P>
<P>
Many of Titus' design clients are in the 50- to-70-year-old range. They've had 
their homes 30 years or more, and they haven't redecorated in about the same 
amount of time. 
</P>
<P>
"These people did these interiors in the '50s, '60s, maybe early '70s," Titus 
says. "The colors they chose back then have become dated. The vegetation around 
their houses has grown up. The houses are looking dingy and darker than when 
the people moved in." 
</P>
<P>
Such clients are switching to a kind of breezy California look, Titus says: 
bright walls, light furniture and less pattern in a war against darkness and 
fading eyesight. MARIA L. La GANGA

ENVIRONMENT: NOTES ABOUT YOUR SURROUNDINGS.

<P>
NESTING PLATFORMS: For more than 10 years, great blue herons have nested in 
eucalyptus trees at the Santa Ana River Lakes in Anaheim. The "lakes," site of 
a fishing concession, are recharge basins controlled by the Orange County Water 
District near where Tustin Avenue crosses the Riverside Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 14 nests produced 12 great blue heron chicks. And once the herons 
finished nesting, double-crested cormorants used the same nests and 
successfully raised young. Five nests produced 11 cormorant chicks, the first 
time the birds are known to have nested in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, increased nesting activity and perhaps other environmental factors 
have damaged the trees. In an effort to protect the bird habitat, artificial 
nesting structures will be built at the site by the County Environmental 
Management Agency, with advice from the state Fish and Game Department. 
</P>
<P>
Erection of four nesting poles, each with three platforms, was to be completed 
in February but was delayed by a paper-work mix-up, according to Dale Dillon of 
the county environmental agency. His agency could put up the poles within two 
weeks, but that may be too late: herons at the site have already started to 
collect materials to reinforce nests from past seasons and will be laying eggs 
in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Esther Burkett, a biologist for Fish and Game who is advising on the project, 
said erection of the poles may have to wait until next year if she decides the 
project will disturb the nesting birds too much. Whether the poles go up or not 
this year, the damaged trees will remain for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
Burkett believes this is the first time in California that nesting structures 
of this type will be tried for great blue herons, although they have been used 
successfully in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana River Lakes site is the largest of several known great blue heron 
rookeries in the county (the rookeries are small, with only 24 to 30 total 
nests known in the county). Others include a few nests on an island in Anaheim 
Lake, some at undeveloped Wagon Wheel Regional Park, and at Irvine Lake. 
</P>
<P>
SPEAKING OF BIRDS: Among the rare bird-sightings reported in January by Doug 
Willick, who compiles the sightings for American Bird magazine, is a pine 
warbler spotted at Yorba Regional Park on Jan. 14 and presumed to be wintering 
there. A common bird of the Eastern pine forests, this marks the first time the 
pine warbler has been recorded in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
An immature bald eagle spotted flying through Upper Newport Bay on Jan. 29 was 
only the second recorded sighting in the county in more than 10 years. 
Historically, the bird wintered in the county in small numbers. 
</P>
<P>
The American white pelicans that descended on the east Anaheim area in 
unprecedented numbers (several hundred were counted) peaked in December and 
have been gradually leaving the area. Several dozen of the impressive birds 
remain and are often seen in the Santa Ana River Lakes area.

NEW AIRPORT PARKING FACILITY OPENS AFTER BALKY TICKET MACHINE STALLS CEREMONY

On a stage on the top level of the new John Wayne Airport southwest parking 
structure, dignitaries stood around a yellow machine Saturday and watched as 
the button marked "Take Ticket" was pushed. 
</P>
<P>
But the group, which had gathered for the dedication of the first completed 
building of the ambitious airport expansion program, waited in vain. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Matranga of Bomel Construction Co., the builder, pressed the button a 
few more times, each time a little more frantically. Still nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, well," John Wayne Airport Manager George A. Rebella joked, "another 
typical airport power failure." 
</P>
<P>
With that reference to a power failure affecting a runway last month, and to a 
series of construction snafus that have bogged down the airport's $310-million 
expansion, airport and county officials officially dedicated the 1,476-space 
parking structure designed to take John Wayne Airport into the future. 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, whose district includes the airport, called 
the structure "another milestone in John Wayne Airport's history." 
</P>
<P>
"This is another of our efforts to bring Orange County's air transport service 
into the 20th Century," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
The four-level structure was scheduled to open for short-term parking at 8 p.m. 
Saturday, and be available for parking daily from 6 a.m. to midnight. Shuttle 
service will take people to the terminals every 10 to 15 minutes. 
</P>

A new 337,000-foot terminal has been scheduled to open by April, 1990. But the 
entire project, which will also add a total of 8,400 new parking spaces, has 
been plagued by problems. 
</P>
<P>
After months of controversy about alleged design errors and cost overruns, the 
Orange County Grand Jury began an investigation in December and concluded a 
month later that the new passenger terminal was 4 months behind schedule and 
probably would not open on time. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, however, officials were optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad we were able to open (the garage) on time, like we expect to open the 
terminal building on time," said Richard Begley, project director for 
Irvine-based HPV Inc., the firm managing the expansion program. "Even though 
it's running into a few little glitches here and there, it's running on time. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first evidence to the public that this project is getting 
somewhere, and it is," Begley said. 
</P>
<P>
The event featured an exhibit of antique cars, model planes and bicycles; a 
fashion show featuring women's wear from the last 100 years, and music from the 
International Youth Choir.

NOTHING GETS IN THE WAY OF IRVINE THEATER KICKOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
By all rights, it should have been postponed. 
</P>
<P>
But when it came time to turn the first official shovelful of dirt at the 
Irvine Theatre construction site Saturday, things went off without a hitch. 
</P>
<P>
After dozens of delays and setbacks, and 15 years of dreaming, hoping and 
planning, members of the Irvine City Council and arts community, along with UC 
Irvine officials, celebrated the beginning of work on the $17.6-million, 
750-seat theater. 
</P>
<P>
"We have come a long way," said UCI Chancellor Jack W. Peltason. "We have just 
a little bit more to go. And then it will be opening night." 
</P>
<P>
The university is one of three partners on the project. The city and the Irvine 
Theatre Operating Co. are also sharing in construction and operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bid Higher Than Budgeted 
</P>
<P>
Three months ago, it looked like the theater might never get built. The lowest 
construction bid -- $17.6 million -- came in considerably higher than the $12.2 
million that had been budgeted, which itself was almost twice as much as the $7 
million originally estimated in 1983, when UC regents approved the idea of 
building a theater on the campus. 
</P>
<P>
But the Irvine City Council approved an additional $1.8 million for the theater 
in December, bringing its total investment to $11.3 million. The university and 
theater operating company also pledged an additional $1.8 million each, 
allowing crews to actually begin work on the project before the year's end. 
</P>
<P>
The ground-breaking ceremony was delayed until March to allow many people 
involved in the planning to be able to attend, said Douglas C. Rankin, general 
manager of the theater. 
</P>
<P>
Sally Anne Sheridan, a City Council member who has worked on behalf of such a 
theater since she was a community services commissioner 15 years ago, said the 
theater's opening next year will be a milestone for the city. "The city is 
beginning to have its soul," she said.

RACIAL AND RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE IN COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I disagree with Rusty Kennedy, director of the Orange County Human Relations 
Commission, who is quoted in The Times (Feb. 11) as saying there is no 
anti-Semitism in the county. All he need do is wear a Star of David and he'll 
learn about anti-Jewish sentiment in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
I run an editorial bureau for a Boston-based newspaper, and my wife is a 
receptionist at a medical clinic. Both of us have seen and experienced 
anti-Semitism, blatant and otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
A common example, which I have heard far too often here, is using the noun 
"Jew" as a verb. It turns my stomach to hear someone say, "He is just trying to 
Jew you down" in reference to negotiations. It also is not uncommon to hear of 
how the Jews allegedly killed Jesus and Jewish people are not welcome here. The 
hate in this county is more widespread than many, I think, want to believe. 
</P>
<P>
There are other examples. The picture I paint is not pretty; it's not meant to 
be. In the 5 years we've lived in the county, we have experienced numerous 
incidents of anti-Semitism. Orange County still deserves its hard-earned 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
That's not to say everyone in the county is an anti-Semite. However, the 
numbers are too high, and it's time Kennedy realizes much work must be done to 
eliminate the problem.

RACIAL AND RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE IN COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It seems that we in Orange County still live in an age of bigotry, racism and 
intolerance. I refer to the defacing of two newly placed freeway signs on the 
Garden Grove and San Diego freeways. The signs announce "Little Saigon Next 
Exit." 
</P>
<P>
Over the past 2 weeks both of these signs have been defaced with spray-painted 
remarks against the Vietnamese community. The first time it happened, around 
Feb. 1, Caltrans quickly cleaned the signs. For this, they should be commended. 
However, I noticed as I drove the freeway today that it has happened again. 
</P>
<P>
The signs announce what has quickly become an important cultural and 
geographical area to the Vietnamese community in Orange County. I am not 
Vietnamese. I work with them and consider them my friends. It saddens me that 
in a county that is quickly becoming a melting pot there are those who are 
bigoted and racist enough to stoop to these levels -- spray-painting remarks 
telling the Vietnamese to "Go Home." 
</P>
<P>
The fact is there is an ever-increasing Vietnamese population in Orange County. 
Because of the problems of their homeland, many could not return if they wanted 
to. We can learn much from these people. I have and consider myself the better 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
If there are those in Orange County who do not wish to take part in this 
melting pot of cultures and continue to deface signs and throw out racial 
slurs, I invite you to check out the country of your heritage and take your own 
advice: "Go Home."

ELECTION SAVINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the last Huntington Beach Union High School District board meeting, agenda 
item 6B went by without a vote or even a mention from the board members. Item 
6B, consolidating the elections, would save the district up to $50,000 every 2 
years. Yet our elected officials saw right through that. They knew this was a 
bad plan for saving some of the pending budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Consolidating the elections was called a partisan move. People were afraid of 
teachers going on strike. They claimed that voters would be uninformed. After 
all is said and done, I guess they're right, because informed voters would have 
never elected such narrow-minded individuals. Except maybe at a private 
election with a sad 9.2% turnout.

TURNING TO SENIORS AS TALENTED RESOURCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was interested in a Times article printed recently that put forth the premise 
that Orange County can no longer tempt talented individuals to come here from 
other parts of the country for the usual reasons of high-cost housing and 
traffic gridlock. It even noted that many companies spend $60,000 to move a 
person from some other location and others spend much more. Considering that 
person needs an adjustment period of 6 months to become useful, the real cost 
is probably much higher. 
</P>
<P>
I am part of an organization called SWAT (Seniors With Amazing Talent), which 
contends that there is a source of first-class professional talent already 
living in Orange County. Senior citizens are for the most part capable, 
vigorous and not ready for retirement in any sense of the word. 
</P>
<P>
The only jobs they are offered are those in the minimum service areas that are 
demeaning to their backgrounds and do not pay enough to make their lives 
meaningful. 
</P>
<P>
Seniors, who make up a huge slice of the population, need more income to exist 
these days and to feel that they are contributing independent people like 
anyone else. I am shocked that employers in Orange County will not look at this 
talented resource before they look elsewhere.

'WOMEN BLITZED BY PRO-LIFERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In her Feb. 13 Notebook ("Women -- Pregnant or Not -- Blitzed by Pro-Lifers," 
Orange County section), reporter Dianne Klein uses third-hand quotes and 
opinions from Planned Parenthood about what Randy Adler, pastor of Stone 
Mountain Church, supposedly said as one of the speakers at a pro-life rescue 
rally last month. 
</P>
<P>
I was at that rally. Pastor Adler did indeed refer to a possible loss of life 
in the conflict over abortion: Those who do not flinch at tearing babies limb 
from limb will hardly think twice about murdering those who peaceably stand in 
their way. Yet Klein obligingly provides quotes comparing Adler to the infamous 
Jim Jones. Obviously, asking Planned Parenthood about the pro-life rescue 
movement is like asking Adolph Hitler about the French Resistance. 
</P>
<P>
Klein writes that when she approached an abortionist's office, she was met by 
peaceful people who gave her a smile, information about unborn life and an 
offer of help. She is offended that anyone would tell a pregnant woman that an 
unborn baby is more than just a blob of "uterine contents." 
</P>
<P>
Klein is outraged that anyone would dare to show a pregnant woman exactly what 
that defenseless baby looks like before the scalpel and the vacuum get to it. 
When will Klein have the journalistic honesty to show what that baby looks like 
after the abortionist gets through with it? 
</P>
<P>
Klein and The Times would have us believe that unborn children are less than 
human -- the property of their mothers, to do with as they please. They protest 
that it is illegal to stand between a pregnant woman and the abortionist's 
knife. Well, as we all know, 150 years ago some Americans were legally termed 
less than human and the property of others. Thank God that the abolitionists 
and the Underground Railroad were willing to risk arrest and their very lives 
to do what was right, not what was "legal." May we all have that same insight 
and courage today.

'REVENGE ATTACK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now I have one more reason to be glad I have only 79 more days as a teacher 
after reading about the Irvine Unified School District's decision to put the 
"suspected" juvenile criminals on "independent study" ("2 in Revenge Attack on 
Irvine High Boy to Be Transferred," Orange County section, Feb. 22). 
</P>
<P>
It is a fact, apparently, that the two boys did beat up on and break the leg of 
another student because that student upheld the law. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, we are not privy to all the details. Perhaps there is some evidence 
not available to us that proves the victim of the mayhem is not entirely 
blameless. Surely he would not be transferred for "fear of retaliation" if he 
were. The retaliation has already occurred and the retaliators removed. 
</P>
<P>
Neither case precludes a proper and just punishment for the criminals. However, 
the kind of solution posed by the school administrators in this case is all too 
common these days in our public schools. 
</P>
<P>
In the district I work in, these kinds of deals are done under the guise of 
"humanism" -- a current code word among school administrators and used, for the 
most part, by those who are not aware of its meaning except in the most 
simplistic terms. 
</P>
<P>
What it has come to mean among school administrators is that those who scoff at 
society's rules and laws are to be given an unlimited number of chances by 
those who are humanists or kind and sensitive to the needs of others. The rest 
of us, those who are not professed humanists and therefore cruel and 
insensitive because we do believe in adhering to rules, are placed at risk. 
</P>
<P>
These humanists either apply rules selectively or have no rules except those 
created on the spot. Thus, the definition of humanism as educators use it has 
evolved. 
</P>
<P>
To begin to set things straight, the Irvine School District can expel those two 
juvenile offenders with the additional condition that they cannot enroll in any 
public school in the state, or maybe even in the country. That is the proper 
and just, and humanistic, solution.

DEATH OF L.A. COUNTY SOCIAL WORKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The news of the fatal stabbing of Robbyn Panitch by one of her patients at the 
Los Angeles County Mental Health Clinic in Santa Monica hit me like a ton of 
bricks. A visual image of her smiling face and dangling earrings comes to mind. 
I knew her. I graduated in the same class with her from the USC School of 
Social Work in 1985. I remember her down-to-earth, unpretentious nature. And I 
remember her commitment to both the field of social work and to the homeless 
and chronically mentally ill population. 
</P>
<P>
But there's something else that nags at me as I experience the emotional impact 
of this tragedy. I do the same thing for a living that she did. I've worked 
with the outpatient Mental Health Department in Orange County, and now in Santa 
Clara County, where security is minimal. I've gone into the streets to evaluate 
people armed with nothing other than a pen and a pad of paper. I've seen 
severely psychotic patients alone in an office about the size of a walk-in 
closet. 
</P>
<P>
I've had tables pushed at me, doors slammed so hard against the wall that holes 
were left where the knobs hit and patients casually mention my home address to 
me during therapy sessions, admitting to following me home the previous week. 
I've been witness to patients screaming, pacing and pounding the tables with 
their fists. 
</P>
<P>
And I wonder as I sit writing this, and as I contemplate the possibility of 
moving back down to Orange County and working in county mental health again, 
why haven't I been the target of more severe attacks? When will it be my turn? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the reaction is fear. But it is also one of outrage and indignation. Does 
society realize the tremendous financial cuts that have been made in the public 
mental health system in recent years? That additional budget cuts are being 
proposed? Do citizens outside the mental health profession realize that 
caseloads are growing increasingly larger, and at this point, that workers are 
being authorized to see only the most seriously mentally ill? 
</P>
<P>
What this leads to is fewer licensed, experienced clinicians who are willing to 
work in the public mental health system, decreased motivation and enthusiasm, 
increased burnout and decreased sensitivity to the potential hazards that 
patients might present. 
</P>
<P>
I demand a response from the community. I challenge citizens to call their 
local state representative or county supervisor's office and simply state, "I 
support additional funding for public mental health services." Additional 
monies need to be made available to public mental health to provide for a 
variety of services ranging from increased availability of psychiatrists for 
more effective and comprehensive medication monitoring to an increased number 
of socialization programs. 
</P>
<P>
Will other mental health professionals be seriously harmed or possibly die 
before action is taken? If Robbyn was here she would ask the very same 
question.

'IT'S RIDICULOUS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After the Times Orange County Edition editorial "It's Ridiculous" (Feb. 12), 
covering a Costa Mesa tax surplus that cannot be spent, a reader from Fountain 
Valley wrote (Feb. 19) that "taxes . . . will seldom be enough to satisfy the 
appetites of government bureaucracies," that "government bureaucracies . . . 
are monopolies (with) no competition to keep them honest or frugal," and that 
"taxes have to be taken away from citizens before they can be given back." 
</P>
<P>
If our leaders are less than honest and frugal, or if they in turn appoint 
people who are less than honest and frugal, why do we keep voting them into 
office? Are we, as voters, not doing our jobs? Are we failing to take personal 
responsibility for our own governance? 
</P>
<P>
Should we replace our government's civil service personnel system with the 
nepotism and cronyism found in other countries? Or should we simply slash 
government services with a balanced budget amendment coupled with more tax cuts 
and be damned with the transportation, overcrowding, crime, health, education, 
housing and environmental problems facing us today? One thing is certain, there 
are many people who would just like to avoid paying taxes. 
</P>
<P>
I have lived in Southern California for 30 years and have witnessed a steady 
increase in the transportation, overcrowding, crime, health, education, housing 
and environmental problems facing us, an increase that has only been 
accelerated since the passage of Proposition 13 and the Gann Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
I think that we can do better than this, that we can improve our society and 
clean up our environment and be reasonably proud to pass them on to future 
generations, but not until we're all willing to ante up our share of the cost.

Midway through the first half Saturday night, it appeared the colossal collapse 
was complete. UC Irvine, a team that had seemed to pull it all together just a 
month ago, was 23 points behind and it appeared the Anteaters would end their 
regular season with not so much as a whimper. 
</P>
<P>
At least they went down with a growl and a yelp. 
</P>
<P>
UC Santa Barbara, which had frolicked to a 37-14 first-half lead, made 12 of 14 
free throws in the final two minutes and hung on for a 78-70 Big West 
Conference victory in front of 5,000 in the Bren Center. It was Irvine's fifth 
consecutive defeat at home. 
</P>
<P>
The loss means Irvine (11-16 overall, 8-10 in the conference) will finish in 
eighth place and play the winner of today's University of the Pacific-San Jose 
State game in the first round of the Big West tournament at Long Beach Arena at 
9 p.m. Wednesday. Santa Barbara (20-7, 11-7) takes third place and meets Long 
Beach on Thursday at 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the sellout crowd were Gaucho fans . . . and many more probably wished 
they were in the first half. But the Anteaters battled back and twice closed 
the gap to one -- at 64-63 and 66-65 -- late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Gaucho guard Carlton Davenport drove the middle and tossed in a high-arched 
five-footer to put Santa Barbara ahead, 66-63, with 2:47 remaining. It was the 
last field goal of the game for the Gauchos, but they made the free throws they 
needed to win. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Irvine played with tremendous intensity, heart and determination in 
the second half," Gaucho Coach Jerry Pimm said. "They deserved to get back in 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very physical game and I think Irvine wanted it that way, to stop the 
clock and hope their free throw percentage was better than ours. But we got the 
ones we needed." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara finished the game with three starters -- forward Paul Johnson, 
center Eric McArthur and guard Davenport -- on the bench with five fouls. And 
backup center Gary Cray was ejected early in the second half for a flagrant 
foul when he threw an elbow at freshman Elgin Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters started the game without sophomore power forward Ricky Butler, 
who has been the main man underneath for Irvine in recent weeks. Butler 
suffered a severe thigh bruise in practice Friday and wasn't even in uniform. 
</P>
<P>
It was senior night for Irvine and, in the early going, the two Anteater 
seniors -- center Mike Doktorczyk and guard Kevin Floyd -- either felt 
compelled to personally make up for the loss of Butler or were under the 
impression that seniors had a license to free-lance on their night. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd scored Irvine's first six points and finished with 17, but he also shot 
two airballs, dribbled the ball off his shoes a couple of times and tried to 
take the ball to the hoop on a one-on-three solo flight. 
</P>
<P>
Doktorczyk made just one of six first-half shots and finished four of 13 -- 
including zero for five on three-pointers -- but he made all 16 free throws he 
attempted and scored 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
"We just let them take it to us in the first half," Doktorczyk said. "Our 
defense was pretty weak. Coach (Bill) Mulligan challenged our manhood at 
halftime." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine responded, but the Anteaters still shot just 42% in the half (39% for 
the game) and came up short when Santa Barbara made its free throws. Forward 
Mike Doyle, who led the Gauchos with 25 points, was four for four from the line 
down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Still, had Irvine not made the run, the Anteaters might as well have mailed in 
the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know, a loss is a loss," Floyd said. "Well, I guess it's better that 
we pulled ourselves up. But I had my mother and father and brother, all the 
people I love, in the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"My father's gonna take off work to watch us play in the tournament and I'm 
gonna kill myself to make sure we don't lose. We've got to win four in a row to 
do anything." 
</P>
<P>
It won't be easy. Assuming the Anteaters and Fresno State -- the seventh-seeded 
team -- win Wednesday, Irvine, as the lowest remaining seed, will get to play 
Nevada Las Vegas on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
"We were trying to get away from playing Wednesday night," Mulligan said in 
reference to the two qualifying games pitting No. 7 against No. 10 and No. 8 
vs. No. 9. "We dug ourselves a hole tonight just like we dug ourselves a hole 
by losing five straight at home."

TITANS USE FANTASTIC FINISH TO WIN IN OVERTIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Of all the dire situations Cal State Fullerton has faced this season, this one, 
in the final seconds of the final regular-season game Saturday, seemed the most 
hopeless. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Long Beach had a three-point lead with 4 seconds remaining, and the 
49ers' Tyrone Mitchell was ready to inbound the ball under the Titans' basket. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell looked for an open man, saw none and passed the ball toward a crowd of 
players. 
</P>
<P>
And the players separated, like the waters parting for the latest Fullerton 
miracle. The ball bounced once, and into the waiting hands of Mark Hill, who 
steadied himself and lofted a shot from the top of the key. Three points. 
Overtime. 
</P>
<P>
That spelled victory for the Titans, 4-0 in overtime games in conference play 
this season. Cedric Ceballos scored all six of the Titans' points in the extra 
period and Fullerton took a 68-66 victory when Long Beach's desperation shot 
from backcourt missed by a mile as time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
It had taken still one more clutch play to win, Ceballos' driving lay-in with 6 
seconds left in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach wanted me to shoot a jump shot, but the lane just opened up," Ceballos 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach had one timeout left, but never called it. Marco Fleming, who 
powered his way to 27 points for the 49ers, had the ball but seemed uncertain, 
and handed it to Mitchell just in time for Mitchell to launch a 50-footer. 
</P>
<P>
The victory ended the Titans' regular season with a 15-12 record, 10-8 in the 
Big West Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Picked to finish ninth in the conference, the Titans finished in a three-way 
tie for fourth with Utah State and Long Beach State. Because those teams split 
against one another, by virtue of its victory over champion Nevada Las Vegas, 
Fullerton claimed the fourth seed, and will play fifth-seeded Utah State in the 
second round Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach (13-14, 10-8) will play UC Santa Barbara Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
For Fullerton's acting coach, John Sneed, it was just one more in a series of 
spectacular finishes that have helped make him the overwhelming public favorite 
for the job. 
</P>
<P>
"If John Sneed doesn't deserve to be the head coach at Fullerton, I don't know 
who in the heck in this world does," Long Beach Coach Joe Harrington said. 
"Tell all those Fullerton people: He can coach." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton seemed to have lost its chance at this one in the late going, when 
trailing by two with 4 seconds remaining in regulation, the Titans' Marlon 
Vaughn was called for a foul as Long Beach tried to inbound the ball on 
Fullerton's end. Vaughn, going for the ball, ran over Bobby Sears. An official 
blew his whistle, and signaled the foul intentional or flagrant, giving Sears 
two shots and awarding the possession to the 49ers. But Sears made only one of 
the shots, and the 49ers never successfully got the ball inbounds, regulation 
ending instead in Hill's shot. 
</P>
<P>
Hill and Ceballos said afterward that they thought Mitchell was trying to 
bounce the ball off of Ceballos' back, and recover it himself. The ploy didn't 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"We should have thrown it long," Harrington said. "It's easy to look back. It 
wasn't one play. It took an unbelieveably big-time shot to tie it up." 
</P>
<P>
While the other four Titans fronted their men, their own backs to the ball, 
Hill was the safety, facing the play. 
</P>
<P>
He picked up the loose ball, appeared to check his feet behind the line, and 
let fly. 
</P>
<P>
"I just pulled up," Hill said. " I knew I was pretty far out." 
</P>
<P>
Thus went another astounding finish for the Titans, who lost a double-overtime 
game to New Orleans but have beaten Pacific, UNLV, San Jose and Long Beach in 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
But weren't the Titans worried this time? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an optimistic person," said Hill, who scored 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
Ceballos had 23. 
</P>
<P>
"They've never given up," Sneed said. 
</P>
<P>
This one, they had to win without Wayne Williams, the hero of other games. 
Williams twisted his right ankle in the second half, and although he came back 
briefly, he finished the game on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted to play, but even though he could move up and down the court, he 
couldn't cut left and right," Sneed said. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Jerry Lloyd said Williams has injured the ankle before coming to 
Fullerton, and that there would be no prognosis on his availability until 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"The last thing he said to us was to win this one," Hill said. "He had tears in 
his eyes." 
</P>
<P>
Simple enough, the Titans won it, and in the process won 10 games more than 
some had predicted they would this season. 
</P>
<P>
"We think now we could have done a little better when we look back," Hill said. 
"But we're very happy, and we're just looking forward to the tournament."

This was for the state wrestling championship, wasn't it? It was hard to tell 
the way Woodbridge High School's Heath Sims ripped through the competition -- 
if you want to call it that. 
</P>
<P>
Sims (55-1), who won the 132-pound championship last year, was one of a record 
four Orange County wrestlers -- which included Katella's Chris Mollkoy (154 
pounds) and Joe Pastorello (175) and Canyon's Zach Cooper (191) -- to win a 
state title Saturday during the CIF state wrestling tournament at the 
University of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Sims pinned Monte Vista's Dustin Harless just 1:05 into the 138-pound final. En 
route to the title, Sims pinned one opponent and beat the other three by a 
combined score of 42-8. He won his semifinal match, against San Jose's Chung 
Le, 19-4. 
</P>
<P>
Does the phrase "no sweat" ring a bell? 
</P>
<P>
"I was wrestling so well," Sims said. "I felt great the whole tournament. My 
confidence was real high." 
</P>
<P>
Sims was so dominant that, though he was the school's only state qualifier, 
Woodbridge finished 13th in the team standings with 30.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
Just as impressive was Katella's team of Mollkoy and Pastorello, who placed 
their school in a tie for third with Clovis with 51.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
Clovis West, which had five wrestlers in the tournament, won the team title 
with 57 points points. El Monte's Arroyo finished second with 52.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
Mollkoy (43-2), after falling behind, 2-0, early in the 154-pound final against 
Yosemite's Caleb Roope, took command to win, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, I really didn't think I wrestled that well," Mollkoy said. "But I 
won, and this is what I've been aiming for since the first day of practice." 
</P>
<P>
Pastorello had a much more difficult time in his final against Westlake's Bill 
Hunter. Pastorello performed an escape early in the second period, and made the 
1-0 score stand up for the title. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third time these two had wrestled this season, Pastorello had taken 
the first two -- at the 4-A finals and Masters meet -- 8-1 and 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Hunter) learned some new tricks," Pastorello said. "He's really improved." 
</P>
<P>
In what might have been the finals' most exciting match, Cooper defeated 
Clovis' Renee Carlos, 7-6, in overtime on a reversal in the last 5 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"This is incredible," said Cooper, who finished his season 45-0. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon finished sixth with 45 points. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the toughest guy I've wrestled this year," Cooper said. "He's got to be 
so bummed right now." 
</P>
<P>
Canyon's Ravi Ramsamooj lost his semifinal match to Covina's Tony Trujillo, 
3-0, the same score of their Masters final last week. Trujillo went on to win 
the 112-pound championship. 
</P>
<P>
Ramsamooj beat El Camino Real's Greg McMurray, 11-5 in the third-place 
semifinal, but lost to El Camino's Michael Grubbs in the third-place match, 
9-2. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna's Tony Okada lost to Overfelt's Javier Gonzales in the semifinals, and 
lost again in the third-place semifinals, 2-0, against Poway's Dale Hanover. 
Okada, a sophomore, placed fifth when his fifth-place opponent, Bullard's 
DeWayne Zinkin, defaulted because of injury. 
</P>
<P>
Okada's teammate, Mike Verbeck, lost his semifinal match to Arroyo's Elfrin 
Gonzales, 7-2 and lost the third-place semifinal, 5-0, to North Bakersfield's 
Joe Cemo. Verbeck took fifth place when his opponent, Rio Mesa's Rob Cook, 
defaulted.

INJURIES, AGOURA STOP CANYON, 2-0

<P>
In the end, the inevitable far outweighed the improbable. 
</P>
<P>
The Canyon High School girls' soccer team, having lost its top two players to 
injury early in the game, lost, 2-0, to top-seeded Agoura in the Southern 
Section 3-A final Saturday at Gahr High School in Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon, the sixth-seeded team, had its biggest challenge of the season going 
into Saturday's match. Agoura (26-0) had set a Southern Section record with 175 
goals this season, and its defense had allowed only six goals. 
</P>
<P>
So when Canyon goalkeeper Keri Erkenbrack went down in the game's opening 
minute, Comanche fans had reason to worry. Erkenbrack, who was kicked in the 
head while trying to stop a shot, was taken to Pioneer Hospital in Artesia for 
X-rays and observation. A mild concussion was the preliminary diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
Less than 20 minutes later, Christa Ramirez, Canyon's scoring leader, limped 
off the field with a sore left knee. Using a variety of taping techniques, 
Ramirez tried several times to play, but could muster little more than 50% of 
her usual firepower and didn't take a shot in the match. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez, who along with Erkenbrack also starred on Canyon's basketball team 
this season, admitted that playing both sports in one season might have led to 
the knee injury, one that she has yet to have checked by a physician. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I'm lucky it happened in the end of the season," Ramirez, a senior, 
said. "I can't be too disappointed. We've done everything we wanted to this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Canyon, which had never advanced beyond the second round of the playoffs, 
played impressively despite its injuries, especially in the first half as it 
out shot Agoura, 7-4. With just seconds remaining in the half, Canyon's Keri 
Springer took a straight shot from five yards out, but Agoura fullback Kelly 
MacDonald reached up with her hands and swatted the ball away. No hand ball was 
called.

CENTRAL OUTRUNS ESPERANZA TO WIN SECOND CONSECUTIVE TITLE

Sergio Ramirez scored on a 10-yard angle shot with 15 minutes left in the game 
to give Central High School of El Centro a 3-2 victory over Esperanza on in the 
Southern Section 2-A boys's soccer final Saturday at Gahr High. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez, who also scored the game-winner in a 3-2 overtime victory over Laguna 
Beach in last year's 2-A final, got this year's goal when he took a loose ball 
in front of the Aztec net and slammed a low kick past goalie Dustin Dubreuil, 
who replaced starter Derek Sabori at the start of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third time in four years that Central (22-1-1) has won at least a 
share of the 2-A title. In the 1986 championship contest, Ramirez's brother, 
Frank, scored the goal that gave the Spartans a 2-2 tie against co-champion 
Brea-Olinda. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza (16-4-2), which used an aggressive, physical defense to compensate 
for the Spartans' speed advantage, was held to two shots in the second half. 
One of them, a 40-yard free kick by Michael Mattegit, was bobbled by Central 
goalie Jose Rodriguez as the ball barely crossed the goal line to tie the score 
at 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't worried after they tied the game at 2-2 because I knew we had at 
least six players who can come back and score at any time," Central Coach Nabil 
Noujaim said. "We have a lot of skill and speed, and we can also pressure the 
ball." 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs, who played the last 6 minutes one man short after Albert de los 
Reyes was ejected from the game for knocking down Ramirez near midfield, were 
unable to penetrate the Central penalty area after Ramirez's goal. 
</P>
<P>
"Esperanza is the most aggressive team we've faced this season," Noujaim said. 
"It takes a lot of discipline to play against a style like theirs, and I was 
proud of the discipline we showed out there." 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza Coach Kino Oaxaca said: "They're one helluva team. They took us out 
of our game. They kept our forwards from getting the ball the way we like to 
get it to them. They totally outran us." 
</P>
<P>
Central took a 1-0 lead 17:53 into the first half when midfielder Luis Ochoa 
dribbled his way past two Aztec defenders and kicked a rising shot past 
Sabori's lunge into the upper corner of the net. 
</P>
<P>
Four minutes later, unguarded forward Michael Voss took a crossing pass from 
Mattegit deep inside the penalty area and tied the score with a low kick into 
the goal. 
</P>
<P>
Central regained the lead, 2-1, with 4 minutes gone in the second half when 
Juan Carlos Cortez scored on a low 20-yard shot after taking a pass from Manuel 
Ramos.

</P>
<P>
In other Fullerton tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
Western 2, Esperanza 0 -- Western advanced in the winners' bracket behind Beth 
Queypo's shutout. 
</P>
<P>
Magnolia 4, Santiago 0 -- Magnolia's Amber Elliot pitched a no-hitter with 
eight strikeouts to beat Santiago in the losers' bracket. 
</P>
<P>
In nonleague softball: 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove 1-5, Ocean View 0-3 -- Stephanie Smith pitched a four-hit shutout 
in the first game for host Garden Grove. In the second game, Brandie Novak 
doubled in two runs to break a 3-3 tie in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon 12-8, Los Amigos 1-1 -- The Comanches limited Los Amigos to three hits 
and two unearned runs in the season-opening doubleheader at Canyon. Canyon's 
Sara Roberts gave up a bunt single to the first batter she faced -- Renee 
Hernandez -- and didn't allow another hit the rest of the way. Kristin Heizer 
pitched a two-hitter in the second game. Canyon first baseman Tina French had 
five hits and four RBIs on the day. Krissy Kyriazis had three hits and scored 
four runs.

WHY AIRPORT IS BUSIER THAN 'RULES' ALLOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Under the current airline access plan at John Wayne Airport, commercial jets 
are allowed an average 55 regulated flights a day -- a limit generally 
expressed as the 55 ADD (for average daily departure) rule. 
</P>
<P>
But airlines are actually flying an average of 96 daily flights, according to 
Airport Manager George Rebella. 
</P>
<P>
The new access plan being developed this month to carry the airport from 1990 
to 2005 will expand the number of regulated flights to 73. 
</P>
<P>
But the airlines will actually be flying somewhere between 115 and 160 daily 
flights, Rebella said. 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
Basically, only flights by certain types of aircraft -- those that generate the 
most noise on takeoff -- are limited under the ADD rules. They are called Class 
A and Class AA flights. 
</P>
<P>
Other flights -- some permanent and some awarded to various airlines on a 
quarterly "supplemental" basis -- are not counted because they are flown with 
the quietest jet engines available. 
</P>
<P>
These Class E (for exempt) flights are what boost the actual totals well beyond 
the regulated ADD limits in the plan. The only limit on these Class E flights 
is that they cannot be used to increase the total number of passengers flown in 
and out of the airport beyond the annual cap established in the access plan. 
Currently, that is 4.75 million passengers a year. Under the new plan, the 
number jumps to 8.4 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, regular Class A, AA and E flights are granted to individual airlines for 
the life of the allocation plan. Supplemental flights are granted periodically 
to enable the airlines to increase their passenger loads to fly the maximum 
number of passengers each year. JOHN O'DELL

STOCK WATCH: NATIONAL EDUCATION JOINS PRESTIGIOUS S&amp;P'S 500 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHARLES TIGHE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
National Education Corp.'s selection to the prestigious Standard &amp; Poor's 
500 index last Wednesday immediately sparked a surge of interest in the Irvine 
company's stock. 
</P>
<P>
Some 660,000 National Education shares were traded Thursday, compared to 51,000 
shares the day before, as portfolio managers added the training and vocational 
education firm to their holdings. Shares gained 88 cents Thursday to close at 
$25.63. The stock closed Friday at $25.50. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the initial buzz of interest will fade, but the effect of being 
included on the list will continue to be positive. 
</P>
<P>
"This might mean overdue recognition for the training-services sector, which 
has had its share of controversy," said Jeff Kessler, a services industry 
analyst at the New York brokerage firm of Shearson Lehman Hutton. 
</P>
<P>
Vocational education firms have been dogged by controversy surrounding loans 
made to students attending schools that were poorly run or that made inflated 
promises of the money that graduates could expect to earn. 
</P>
<P>
"National Education is one of the most respected in the business, but it is 
hurt by the not-so-goods," Kessler said. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Patterson, a Standard &amp; Poor's analyst, said that National Education is 
the only training and vocational education firm on S&amp;P's index. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson said S&amp;P bases its selections largely on a company's market 
value, and it seeks firms that provide broad, representational diversity among 
the 5,000 issues followed by the research firm. The 500 stocks represent $1.95 
trillion of the $3 trillion in market value for all 5,000 stocks. 
</P>
<P>
National Education replaced Church's Fried Chicken on the closely watched 
index. Church's is being acquired by a privately owned firm. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, there were 26 changes in the list, including the addition of 
Security Pacific Corp. in Los Angeles. No Orange County firms were added last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks in the index are weighted by their total market value, with IBM given 
the most weight. With a ranking of 442 out of 500, National Education won't 
suddenly become a bellwether for the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
But it will be a member of an index that many professional investors study more 
closely than the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 stocks. Most stock-index 
options and stock-index futures are based on the performance of the S&amp;P 
500. Because of this, institutional portfolio managers own shares in each of 
the stocks to hedge the risk of their index positions. 
</P>
<P>
National Education Chairman H. David Bright described the selection by S&amp;P 
as a "great benefit for our many stockholders." But analysts said that National 
Education stock is not likely to soar in value because of the selection. 
</P>
<P>
As the largest vocational education and training services firm in the country, 
"it's already a closely watched firm on Wall Street," said Arthur Rade, an 
analyst at Merrill Lynch Research in New York. 
</P>
<P>
National Education's stock price has increased steadily from a low of $12.38 in 
1986 as the firm's revenues and profits have climbed. Rade and Kessler expect 
the company to earn $52.2 million in 1989, compared with net earnings of $46.1 
million reported for 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The analysts lowered their 1989 earnings estimates by $2.5 million earlier this 
year after reports of a slight decrease in the number of students enrolled in 
vocational education schools nationally. National Education has done better 
than the national average, but enrollment has been flat in its vocational 
education programs for the first part of 1989, according to Barbara Milla, a 
spokeswoman for the company. 
</P>
<P>
With low levels of unemployment and plenty of jobs available, there are fewer 
incentives for young people to return to school for vocational training. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the one negative for the company. It's going to be a little tougher to 
get the enrollments. And marketing costs are going to increase as a result," 
Rade said. 
</P>
<P>
A poorer performance in vocational education, Rade suggested, should be offset 
by gains in National Education's primary business of industrial training. 
Vocational education and the company's publications represented about one-third 
of National Education's total revenue of $457.5 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
Rade attributed much of the company's success in 1988 to the $250-million 
acquisition of Advanced Systems, a Naperville, Ill., training company. When the 
acquisition was announced in 1987, analysts said its advisability was unknown. 
</P>
<P>
"But it clearly has merged into the company as a profitable operation," Rade 
said.

R2-D2 WHERE ARE YOU? ROBOTS STALL AT THRESHOLD OF UNCERTAIN FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PITTSBURGH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists in the 1950s proclaimed the robot the wave of the future. It would 
free housewives of drudgery and fill factories with a tireless steel-collar 
work force. But in many ways, the wave has been a washout. 
</P>
<P>
Robots can paint cars, salvage nuclear fuel and even assist in brain surgery, 
but they're still pretty dumb. And they are far from the science-fiction 
promise of comic books and movies. 
</P>
<P>
"Robots now are significantly better than (they were) 30 years ago, but that 
doesn't necessarily mean we are anywhere close to an R2-D2 or C-3PO," says Raj 
Reddy, director of The Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, 
referring to the robot characters in the "Star Wars" movies. 
</P>
<P>
Orders for American-made robots have been falling since their peak of $501 
million in 1984, according to the Robotics Industries Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say automating a factory is more complicated than just buying a robot 
and putting it on the assembly line. In addition, they say, some industrial 
robots are too complicated and prone to failure and, when they do work, they 
don't always fit in with factory operations. 
</P>
<P>
About 33,000 robots work in the United States, mostly in manufacturing, with 
auto makers buying at least 40%, says robots association spokesman Jeffrey A. 
Burnstein. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a revolution. It's an evolution," Burnstein says. "Robots are another 
new, productive technology in the same way that computers were." 
</P>
<P>
Japan is the world's leading robot user, followed by the United States, West 
Germany and France. 
</P>
<P>
"Robots are still dumb," Reddy says. "They're dumb because we haven't taken the 
trouble to put the pieces together, not because we don't know how. That takes 
money and time and effort, and we don't have the money." 
</P>
<P>
But today's robots can: 
</P>
<P>
 -- See. They don't see like humans, but they can recognize forms and shapes 
and measure distances through sonar, ranging devices and lasers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hear and speak. They use computers that recognize thousands of words. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Smell. Their sensors can detect smoke or fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Move. They most often roll on wheels, but some models hop on one leg and 
others walk with as many as eight legs, ambling like a spider on uneven 
terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Touch. They can recognize texture and the force of a movement, such as 
pressing. 
</P>
<P>
Many robots have one or two of these abilities to some degree, but creating a 
competent robot that combines most or all of them has been difficult. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, scientists have found it's difficult to match human abilities that 
most people take for granted, such as the dexterity of a finger or the ability 
to identify objects. 
</P>
<P>
"The rule of thumb is that if you think the job is easy, then it's usually 
difficult," says Takeo Kanade, co-director of the Carnegie Mellon institute. 
"The list of things that robots can do better than humans is much, much shorter 
than the list of things robots cannot." 
</P>
<P>
Industrial robots can perform many tedious tasks with precision, including 
welding, assembling, painting, packaging and loading, yet Burnstein estimates 
that fewer than 5% of American companies have installed even one robot. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese companies, which have installed more than twice as many robots as 
American companies, have been more willing to invest in robots that take years 
to pay for themselves, Burnstein says. 
</P>
<P>
"Robots are very expensive to make and they can do very little," says Hans 
Moravec, senior research scientist at Carnegie Mellon. "It's hard to find a job 
for them that actually pays off." 
</P>
<P>
Moravec says the industrial robot is about as smart as an insect. 
</P>
<P>
"The robots working on the assembly line today might well be compared to 
spiders," he says. "They do their jobs competently, but it's a narrow job." 
</P>
<P>
Industrial robots often shut down when even the slightest thing goes wrong, 
forcing humans to their aid, says Donald Michie, chief scientist of the Turing 
Institute of Glasgow, Scotland, which conducts research into artificial 
intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
Michie is trying to develop computers that learn from experience -- a 
technology that could result in robots that adjust to changing circumstances 
and learn from mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
Moravec believes technology will enable robots to have human-like intelligence 
in about 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
Service robots, a new breed, are moving off the factory floor to handle work in 
hazardous environments, help the disabled, or just sweep floors. Underwater 
robots are examining lake bottoms and doing risky deep-sea work. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors at Memorial Medical Center of Long Beach, Calif., have performed more 
than 35 brain operations with the help of a robot arm that guides surgeons as 
they drill into the skull. 
</P>
<P>
Research is under way at Carnegie Mellon on a six-legged robot to explore the 
surface of Mars in the next decade and on a car that can drive itself. 
University researchers also made robots to remove radioactive waste from the 
crippled Three Mile Island nuclear plant near Harrisburg. 
</P>
<P>
K.G. Engelhardt, director of the university's health and human services lab, is 
developing a robotic workstation that allows the disabled, especially those 
without the use of their hands, to work in an office. The station should be 
marketed by the end of the year, selling for less than $50,000, she says. 
</P>
<P>
Tish Pferdehirt, 44, a vocational rehabilitation counselor in Pittsburgh, helps 
test the station. With paralyzed legs and only limited use of her arms, she 
knows firsthand the benefits of such a helpmate. 
</P>
<P>
"It does all kinds of things from getting a book off a shelf for me, to turning 
off a radio, to picking up a file and putting it in an in-out box," she says. 
</P>
<P>
The work station has an arm that turns, bends and swivels as Pferdehirt speaks 
commands into a microphone. It fetches things, looks up telephone numbers and 
dials the phone. 
</P>
<P>
Engelhardt hopes to make the robot work on projects independently, such as 
shredding paper, when she is not there, thus making it more valuable. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph F. Engelberger has big corporate backers for his service robots. 
</P>
<P>
Projects in the works at Engelberger's Transitions Research Corp. of Danbury, 
Conn., include development of robots that will sweep or scrub floors in 
airports or supermarkets and fetch drugs for pharmacists in mail-order 
warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
Another Engelberger robot is Help-Mate, a nurse's aide that delivers meals to 
hospital patients and makes other deliveries, such as taking a urine specimen 
to a lab. 
</P>
<P>
Help-Mate, designed to use elevators and negotiate hallways as it moves by 
itself on wheels, is being tested, and Engelberger said it will go on sale for 
$40,000 by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
Engelberger hopes to get corporate backing to build his dream robot: a $50,000 
household helper that would prepare light meals, clean house and clear snow. 
But he can't figure out how to teach it to make beds. 
</P>
<P>
He estimates it would take up to $14 million and 2 1/2 years to develop, but 
American companies so far have been unwilling to make the initial investment. 
</P>
<P>
Engelberger helped pioneer an industrial robot more than 30 years ago, but the 
history of the automaton goes back farther. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole idea of building a mechanical man is fairly old," Moravec says. 
"There were clockwork automatons built by Swiss and French clock smiths in the 
18th Century and 17th Century." 
</P>
<P>
The term robotics was coined in 1942 in a science-fiction story by Isaac Asimov 
from the word robot, which was coined in 1921 by Czech playwright Karel Capek. 
</P>
<P>
In 1954, American inventor George Devol filed a patent for a programmable robot 
arm whose movement was controlled by punched program cards. In 1958, Devol and 
Engelberger formed a company to build the machines. 
</P>
<P>
Their first industrial robot was installed in 1961 in a General Motors Corp. 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
Engelberger says visions in the 1950s of a robot-filled world fizzled when the 
promises outran technology. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything was supposed to become automated," he says. "It was all blue sky, 
but the technology wasn't available. The technology is just becoming available, 
but I have a difficult time convincing people we can do it today."

<P>
The crisis in emergency medical care that has shaken Los Angeles has begun 
rippling through the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Temporary closures of emergency rooms and tense waits by paramedics to find 
available beds once were unheard of in suburban hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
But in recent months, troubles have hit the region in ways few could have 
imagined as recently as two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Consider these incidents in the San Gabriel Valley that occurred in early 
January: 
</P>
<P>
Covina's Inter-Community Medical Center diverted paramedic ambulances carrying 
critically ill patients for all but 48 hours during a 12-day period because its 
intensive care and coronary care units had no available beds. 
</P>
<P>
Ten of the 16 hospitals in the San Gabriel Valley were simultaneously closed to 
critical patients for three hours on Jan. 10 because there were no empty beds. 
</P>
<P>
And for the first time that anyone can remember, Huntington Memorial Hospital 
in Pasadena, the largest hospital in the San Gabriel Valley, had to temporarily 
close its emergency room to paramedic ambulances on Jan. 9 because it was 
overrun with patients. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Approaching Limit 
</P>
<P>
The flu season has been a major reason for the number of emergency room 
closures in the San Gabriel Valley. Even so, conditions have not approached the 
snarling disarray that has become the norm at County-USC Medical Center in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But most doctors agree the San Gabriel Valley's emergency system is approaching 
its limit, and the first signs of stress appeared well before winter. 
</P>
<P>
The troubles in the emergency medical care system, which some have described as 
a "brownout," have brought a bounty of changes, some routine, others ominous. 
</P>
<P>
When Arcadia's Methodist Hospital of Southern California noticed its emergency 
room consistently filling with patients 18 months ago, it ordered all emergency 
physicians to install car phones so they could be summoned at any time. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. John A. Mardones, head of the emergency room at Monterey Park Hospital, 
said he has just begun noticing a new phenomenon among patients that he calls 
"emergency room shopping." 
</P>
<P>
"It's like looking for a good restaurant," he said. "They'll go to one place 
and then another to find one with less waiting." 
</P>
<P>
At Santa Teresita Hospital in Duarte, the crowding and increased costs of 
maintaining an emergency room have led the hospital to threaten to close it to 
paramedics at the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
Most emergency physicians at San Gabriel Valley hospitals say patients have not 
been seriously affected in the suburbs, and they know of no deaths attributed 
to the problems. But those doctors are now casting an eye toward Los Angeles, 
which they see as a harbinger of their own future. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a snowball coming down the hill," said Hallie Hetzel, chief 
operating officer of San Gabriel Valley Medical Center. "It's going to hit us 
sooner or later." 
</P>
<P>
Tracing the cause of the brownout is like trying to piece together a jigsaw 
puzzle that has been strewn on the floor. There are no single sources, but 
several interlocking problems. 
</P>
<P>
The growth of the San Gabriel Valley as well as the aging of the population and 
the shortage of skilled nurses have all contributed to overloading the system. 
</P>
<P>
Most doctors, however, say the critical link in the chain of events was the 
skyrocketing cost of providing care for Medi-Cal, Medicare and uninsured 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
Medi-Cal and Medicare reimburse hospitals for their services, but the payments 
have failed to keep pace with the rising cost of health care, the doctors say. 
Medi-Cal provides health insurance to the poor and Medicare to the elderly and 
disabled. 
</P>
<P>
The losses have created a financial drain that has deprived hospitals of the 
funds and incentive to expand their emergency rooms, doctors say. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the case of a 5-month-old baby who was brought to the emergency room 
at San Gabriel Valley Medical Center with seizures. The child was stabilized, 
tested and then transferred to Huntington Memorial. The bill came to $1,187. 
The hospital received $157. 
</P>
<P>
"I could find 30 cases in a row just like that," said Dr. W. Richard Bukata, 
head of San Gabriel Valley's emergency room. "The hospitals are losing money 
left and right." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Insurance Study 
</P>
<P>
Compounding the problems is the growing number of patients who have no 
insurance. In the Los Angeles metropolitan area, one in four people under the 
age of 65 is uninsured, the highest proportion of any area in the country. Just 
a decade a ago, the figure was one in five, according to a recent study by two 
UCLA public-health professors. 
</P>
<P>
With nowhere else to go, these patients have turned to emergency rooms where 
they cannot be turned away. 
</P>
<P>
The losses for hospitals have been enormous. In 1982, unreimbursed costs for 
treating Medi-Cal, Medicare and uninsured patients at the 16 hospitals in the 
San Gabriel Valley reached $36.5 million. Last year, the figure topped $73.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The problems have hit inner-city hospitals the hardest, but they have spread 
outward toward private suburban hospitals linked with the large county 
hospitals in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
County-USC Medical Center has the prime responsibility for caring for the 
county's poor. So private hospitals in the San Gabriel Valley have long 
transferred most indigent patients there once they are stable enough to move. 
</P>
<P>
Those transfers, however, have become much harder in the last 12 to 18 months 
because of the lack of space, said Dr. J. Paul Holland, director of the 
emergency room at Queen of the Valley Hospital in West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chain Reaction 
</P>
<P>
Last year, almost 60% of the potential transfers from Queen of the Valley, or 
150 patients, were rejected by County-USC. 
</P>
<P>
The result frequently is a chain reaction. Critical-care patients brought to 
Queen of the Valley are diverted to other hospitals, which then fill up and 
must divert patients to yet other hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
"We run at near-capacity almost all the time, and it takes just a small change 
to saturate us," Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
The most publicized victim of the crisis has been the county's trauma-care 
system, which was set up in 1983 to guarantee victims of serious injuries a 
maximum 20-minute ambulance ride to a specialized emergency room staffed 24 
hours a day by a team of emergency physicians. 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals competed fiercely for the prestigious designation of being a trauma 
center. 
</P>
<P>
But staying in the system was more expensive than many imagined, and eight of 
the 23 original trauma centers have dropped out, including three in the San 
Gabriel Valley: Queen of the Valley, Methodist Hospital and Pomona Valley 
Community Hospital in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Delays in Treatment 
</P>
<P>
Today, Huntington Memorial is the only trauma center left in the San Gabriel 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The number of trauma cases has always been small. For example, out of the 4,786 
patients seen at Pomona Valley's emergency room in January, just 42 were trauma 
patients 
</P>
<P>
But the loss of three trauma centers in the San Gabriel Valley has meant 
occasional delays in treating the seriously injured. Trauma patients are now 
taken to the nearest hospital, but sometimes must wait for a surgical team to 
be summoned, a process that can take half an hour or more. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the San Gabriel Valley hospitals have been able to adjust to 
the new load of emergency room patients. 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, the system has several protections to avoid outright disaster. 
</P>
<P>
No hospital, no matter how crowded, can turn away a patient when it is a matter 
of life or death. Emergency rooms always accept walk-in patients or those who 
have been transported by ambulances that do not have paramedics on board. And 
in the worst case, when every emergency room in the area is closed, the county 
requires every hospital reopened to prevent a total blackout of emergency care. 
</P>
<P>
But recently, rumors have begun surfacing that some hospitals are not playing 
by the rules and are closing to lessen their workload or avoid treating 
indigent patients. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the county warned Greater El Monte Community Hospital and 
Inter-Community Medical Center for closing even though beds were still 
available. 
</P>
<P>
Inspectors visited both hospitals in late January and found three out of six 
emergency room beds empty at Greater El Monte and 10 of 13 empty at 
Inter-Community. 
</P>
<P>
But officials at both hospitals say their emergency rooms were reported closed 
because of misunderstandings, and the county agrees that neither case was a 
deliberate attempt to break the rules. 
</P>
<P>
But some paramedics and doctors believe instances of abuse have probably 
occurred because the temptation is strong. 
</P>
<P>
"People are people," said Mardones of Monterey Park Hospital. "There's no doubt 
the temptation is there." 
</P>
<P>
Even with a system that functions properly, some doctors worry that the load 
has reached the point where it is only a matter of time before a patient is 
harmed because they had to be diverted to a more distant hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care how good you are, you're not God, and you make mistakes," said 
Dr. Russell Maatz, head of the emergency room at Methodist Hospital. "You have 
to go by the information the paramedics give you and you make the best guess 
you can. Now, something unexpected doesn't happen 99% of the time, but it does 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
The predictions of a collapse in the system are only part of the picture. Some 
hospitals have actually welcomed the increase in emergency room patients. 
</P>
<P>
Although emergency rooms are generally money losers, they also are an entryway 
for paying patients who end up staying in other parts of the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be thrilled to death to get more patients," said Dr. Keith J. Rosing, head 
of the emergency room at St. Luke Medical Center in Pasadena. "Its a problem 
I'd love to have." 
</P>
<P>
St. Luke has always played second fiddle to its much larger cross-town cousin, 
Huntington Memorial, which receives most of the emergency patients in the city. 
</P>
<P>
In the past eight years, the number of emergency patients at St. Luke has 
dwindled from 24,700 to 16,500. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not in a poor area and we a have a nice mix of patients," Rosing said. 
"More patients wouldn't hurt us at this point." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High-Priced Care 
</P>
<P>
But even hospitals like St. Luke worry that as Medi-Cal and Medicare 
reimbursements fall farther behind hospital costs and the indigent population 
increases, they too will feel the pinch. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if we wanted to take care of these patients for nothing, you can't do it 
without the facilities," said Maatz of Methodist Hospital. "The nurses, the 
equipment, the space, everything about emergency care is high-priced." 
</P>
<P>
Looming on the horizon is the possibility that some hospitals will ultimately 
find it too expensive to maintain their emergency rooms and simply close them. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, French Hospital and Linda Vista Hospital downgraded the status 
of their emergency rooms last year. They no longer accept patients brought by 
paramedic ambulances. In January, Queen of Angels Medical Center closed its 
entire facility to merge with Hollywood-Presbyterian Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
No emergency room in the San Gabriel Valley has moved to ban paramedic traffic, 
although Santa Teresita Hospital in Duarte is threatening to be the first. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital originally announced that it would close its emergency room to 
paramedic ambulances March 1 unless the county approved a request to add 23 
beds to the hospital's nursing home. The hospital decided last week to extend 
the deadline to the end of the month and has left open the possibility of 
extending it yet another 30 days. Santa Teresita officials expect their 
proposal to add the beds to be approved. The emergency room lost $400,000 in 
1987 and $600,000 last year. By enlarging its nursing home, the hospital 
estimates it could make an extra $800,000 a year, which would offset its 
emergency room losses. 
</P>
<P>
Closing Santa Teresita's emergency room to paramedics would have a limited 
effect on hospitals outside of its immediate area, health officials say. 
</P>
<P>
But many doctors worry that other hospitals may eventually consider downgrading 
their emergency rooms because the problems are so widespread and the rationale 
to close, at least on an economic level, is so compelling. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of one emergency room could be absorbed by other hospitals, but how 
many more would it take to begin affecting care throughout the San Gabriel 
Valley? 
</P>
<P>
"If things continue to go the way they are going with no new funding, you're 
going to see other emergency rooms close or downscale," said Jeffrey P. Winter, 
administrator of Greater El Monte Community Hospital. Then clearly it's just a 
matter of time, he said, before the tangled congestion in inner-city hospitals 
becomes a reality in the San Gabriel Valley.

In the beginning, all flowers grew wild. Dating back to prehistoric times, 
flowers were found from the Arctic to the tropics. Because of their attractive 
shapes, beautiful colors and marvelous fragrances, flowers have been used for 
various purposes -- with expressing feelings and religious/civil ceremonies 
being among the most common. 
</P>
<P>
Garden flowers -- actually cultivated wild flowers -- come in three basic 
groups: annuals, perennials and biennials. The annuals are those that bloom, 
look attractive and die. Perennials live about three years and then die. 
Biennials live about two years but only produce during their second year. Some 
flowers provide pleasant scents, others have pretty colors and some both. 
Here's a guide to getting started with some of the county's most 
commonly-planted flowers. All are easy to plant and care is simple.

KING'S NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As an admirer of the Rev. Dr. Margin Luther King Jr., I am deeply saddened to 
see his name become the lightning rod for so much anger and bitterness. 
</P>
<P>
In the controversy over naming the San Diego convention center, people seem to 
have lost track of an important perspective: Dr. King was part of the civil 
rights movement, a political and social struggle that involved thousands of 
people across America. Some people see Dr. King as a hero, and some do not; 
however, the fact remains that the civil rights movement profoundly affected 
the course of American society. 
</P>
<P>
All those who are now so passionately caught up in the convention center 
controversy would do well to stop and ask themselves how the city of San Diego 
should educate itself about the history of the civil rights movement. I propose 
that the City Council dedicate itself to establishing a museum dealing with the 
history of civil rights in America. Such a museum would serve to honor Dr. King 
in a way far more fitting than any naming of the new convention center.

'CLEAN-AIR CRUNCH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times has been in the forefront in its support of a program for clean air, 
and in seeking commitment to an effective plan that can enable us to reach the 
nationally established ambient air-quality standards for the region (editorial, 
"Clean-Air Crunch," Feb. 17). We applaud The Times commitment to this goal, and 
we believe that only through a strong public information program can we truly 
generate commitment that will be necessary to achieve the path to clean air. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce was disappointed, however, in The 
Times characterization of the position of the business community relative to 
clean-air objectives. We also are disappointed that an editorial policy which 
has so consistently supported commitments to other major social service goals 
in the areas of education, health care, housing and care for the homeless, 
objects when an organization raises the point that committing available 
resources to achieve air-quality goals, can have a serious impact on the 
resources available to achieve other much needed regional goals. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce has publicly urged the Southern 
California Assn. of Governments and the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District to adopt the Clean Air Plan on March 17. We also have requested that 
the district make available a full description of what the costs of each 
segment of that plan will be over the next 5, 10 and 20 years. We have urged 
that the district adopt a resolution of flexibility, which will clarify that 
any new concepts brought forth to achieve clean-air objectives will be fully 
evaluated and may be substituted for existing elements of the plan, if the new 
strategies prove both environmentally sound and cost effective. 
</P>
<P>
We believe that a plan that is estimated to cost $3 billion to $4 billion a 
year needs to be fully evaluated and debated by all segments of the community. 
However, we understand that a plan must be adopted and implemented. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed air-quality plan is not the singular province of the staff of a 
government agency, or even of the air district itself. It is a plan that all 
citizens and businesses within the basin must know, understand and be committed 
to. Honest debate about proposals that make the plan more reasonable, more 
flexible and more effective is the least those of us who live and work here 
should expect.
