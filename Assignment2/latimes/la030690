LEAD LEVELS PUT 25% OF SOUTHLAND CHILDREN AT RISK

More than 25% of Southern California children -- and more than 40% in the San 
Diego metropolitan area -- may have levels of lead in their blood that could 
diminish learning ability and cause behavioral problems, according to a 
national study made public Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 60% of the children in the Los Angeles-Long Beach area are estimated to 
have lead levels that could impair learning, according to the study, which 
found rates to be at least 33% in seven California population areas of 1 
million or more people. 
</P>
<P>
The study by the Environmental Defense Fund is the first to calculate the 
potential lead exposure to children in specific U.S. metropolitan areas. The 
report used estimates from the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease 
Registry, whose data was based on the number of young children, ages 6 months 
to 5 years, living in older houses where lead-based paint is usually found, on 
family income levels, and on some screening programs that relied on blood tests 
to measure lead levels. 
</P>
<P>
"Lead poisoning is beyond question the single most significant preventable 
disease of environmental origin in the United States," Ellen K. Silbergeld, a 
toxicologist on the staff of the 100,000-member environmental organization, 
said at a Washington news conference. "Over 3 million children currently have 
levels of lead in the toxic range. They are not at risk for disease -- they 
have lead toxicity." 
</P>
<P>
About 58% of the children in the Los Angeles-Long Beach area and at least a 
third in San Diego, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and Santa Barbara 
counties were estimated to have lead levels of more than 10 micrograms per 
deciliter of blood, an amount that generally produces no physical symptoms but 
can reduce by four to seven points a child's performance on IQ tests. About a 
quarter of the Ventura County children were estimated to have lead at those 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
Although the study did not actually measure the lead in the blood of all urban 
children, the findings largely confirmed, within a 5% margin, the results of 
smaller investigations that did take blood tests. 
</P>
<P>
The Centers for Disease Control now recommend intervention at levels of 25 
micrograms per deciliter of blood. But recent epidemiological studies that 
found damage at levels as low as 10 and 15 micrograms have prompted the CDC to 
review its guideline. It is expected to be lowered within a year. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Diego metropolitan area, 40.3% of the children were estimated to 
have lead levels of more than 10 micrograms while 12.6% were estimated to have 
levels of at least 15 micrograms, according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles-Long Beach metropolitan area, 21% of the young children were 
estimated to have levels greater than 15 micrograms. A recent state public 
health investigation that relied on blood samples of young children in Compton 
and Wilmington found that 20% of the youngsters had levels of at least 15 
micrograms, the lowest level examined in the study. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Lynn Goldman, a pediatrician and epidemiologist who heads the California 
Department of Health Services section that did the Compton and Wilmington 
testing, said she had not examined the methodology used in Monday's report but 
found its numbers "not surprising." The U.S. public health survey from which 
the environmental group extrapolated its figures contained "reasonable" 
assumptions, she said. 
</P>
<P>
She noted, however, that the environmental group's estimates may "reflect the 
highest-risk areas" in some communities. For example, she said, a recent 
investigation by her section found 17% of the children in a "high-risk" Oakland 
neighborhood had levels of at least 15 micrograms of lead per deciliter of 
blood. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, Monday's report estimated that 19.7% of all young children in 
the San Francisco-Oakland metropolitan area have such levels. Goldman said she 
would have expected the level in the entire region to be lower, not higher, 
than the Oakland neighborhood, which contained mostly older, dilapidated 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
Karen L. Florini, an attorney for the environmental group, acknowledged that 
the estimates could be high for some regions. But she said they also may be too 
low for other regions because they fail to take into account additional 
exposure from lead smelters or other lead-producing industries in some 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not trying to say that you would get these specific numbers if you 
tested the children," she said. "But even if they were 50% too high, they still 
indicate an epidemic by anybody's definition." 
</P>
<P>
It is virtually impossible to determine the extent to which an individual child 
may be impaired at exposures of 10 or 15 micrograms of lead per deciliter of 
blood. Some children, because of such factors as nutrition and genetics, may 
not be affected while others will perform poorly in school as a result of the 
same exposure. Moreover, the loss of a few IQ points may not make a great 
difference in a child's ultimate achievements. 
</P>
<P>
It is only when large populations are studied that significant differences and 
reasons for concern emerge. Lead exposure in a large population will 
significantly reduce the number of those with superior intelligence and 
increase the number with below-average intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
Banned for most uses in 1977, lead-based paint still can be found in millions 
of American homes. Children usually are exposed through household dust 
contaminated by peeling, flaking or chalking paint. Young children also may be 
poisoned during teething by mouthing on window sills that contain leaded paint. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to reducing IQ, lead in young children can impair reaction time and 
the ability to concentrate and cause short-term memory loss. The longer the 
exposure, the greater the damage. Impairment is believed to be permanent, even 
after a child's lead levels are reduced to relatively low amounts. 
</P>
<P>
At congressional hearings later this week, the Environmental Defense Fund will 
propose creation of a $1.5-billion-a-year trust fund to remove lead-based paint 
from housing. The money would be raised through an excise tax on the production 
and importation of lead. Estimated costs for professional removal of lead-based 
paint from residences run between $2,000 and $10,000 a unit. 
</P>

 Chart shows the percentage of children ages 6 months to 5 years who are 
projected to exceed selected blood lead levels, broken down in selected 
population groups. Figures are expressed in micrograms of lead per deciliter of 
blood (MCG/DL). The federal Centers for Disease Control is currently reviewing 
its definition of "lead toxicity," now set at 25 micrograms per deciliter of 
blood. The CDC is expected to adopt a new definition of 10 to 15 micrograms per 
deciliter within the year.

GLORIA CARTER SPANN, 63; SISTER OF EX-PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gloria Carter Spann, the last of Jimmy Carter's siblings, died Monday of 
pancreatic cancer, the same disease that killed her father, sister and brother. 
</P>
<P>
The motorcycle-riding, harmonica-playing, fun-loving younger sister of the 
former President was 63 and her ailment, which is almost always fatal, had been 
diagnosed in December. 
</P>
<P>
Pancreatic cancer killed her father, James Earl Carter, when he was in his 50s; 
her sister, Ruth Carter Stapleton, who was 54 when she died in 1983; and her 
other brother, Billy Carter, who was 51 when he died in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Her mother, Lillian Carter, had breast cancer that had spread to other organs, 
including the pancreas, when she died in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Spann, who lived in nearby Plains, died about 1 a.m. at Sumter Regional 
Hospital in Americus, according to her husband, Walter. Relatives said she had 
been hospitalized for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The 65-year-old former President was at the hospital when Mrs. Spann died, said 
Sybil Carter, the widow of Billy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very sad for all of us. It's just something we don't understand," Mrs. 
Carter told the Associated Press. "Our family is grieved and saddened." 
</P>
<P>
Named the Most Outstanding Female Motorcyclist in the nation in 1978, Mrs. 
Spann, like the rest of the outgoing Carters, seemed to thrive on attention 
while insisting she was really "shy and retiring." 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband owned as many as five motorcycles, which they kept at their 
peanut farm and rode on weekends with friends or fellow members of the Georgia 
Motorcycle Rights Organization. 
</P>
<P>
At other times she taught art classes at night or kept books for the city of 
Plains. 
</P>
<P>
Her late sister was a minister and she alluded to herself as a "Jesus freak," 
but disdained the "born again" philosophy of brother Jimmy, saying she 
considered it "tacky." 
</P>
<P>
Although she fretted over her lack of privacy after Jimmy Carter launched his 
presidential bid in 1976, she acquiesced in the demand for interviews and 
seemed to delight in showing off her farm, her husband and her motorcycle 
jacket -- which said "Bad News" on the back. 
</P>
<P>
During the campaign she and seven other investors hawked one-square-inch lots 
of peanut-farming land in Plains for $5 a lot, bringing an angry disclaimer 
from Jimmy who denounced it as a "fast-buck shyster scheme." 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband did not attend the Democratic National Convention where 
Carter was nominated, adding to reports of a rift between them, which she 
denied. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Spann will be buried today at a graveside service in Plains after a 
funeral procession led by motorcyclists.

STANLEY BARNES, 89; SENIOR JUDGE OF U.S. 9TH CIRCUIT COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stanley N. Barnes, an athlete-scholar who was an All-Pacific Coast lineman on 
UC Berkeley's "Wonder Teams" of seven decades ago and then undertook what 
proved to be a lengthy and distinguished career in law, died Monday at his home 
in Palm Springs of the complications of age. 
</P>
<P>
The senior judge of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals was 89 and had been 
appointed to that court in 1956 by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Baraboo, Wis., Barnes served in the Navy in World War I and afterward 
attended UC Berkeley, where he played football and competed in two Rose Bowl 
games. In 1918, he was chosen an All Coast center and in 1920 and '21 All Coast 
tackle. 
</P>
<P>
After graduating in 1922, he studied at Harvard but returned to Berkeley to 
take his law degree in 1925. He was admitted to the California Bar that year 
and began practicing in San Francisco. He came to Los Angeles three years later 
and stayed in private practice until his appointment to the Los Angeles County 
Superior Court in 1946. He was presiding judge of the criminal departments from 
1949 to 1950 and presiding judge of the Superior Court from 1952 to 1953, when 
he was named an assistant attorney general of the United States in charge of 
the antitrust department. He stayed in that post until Eisenhower named him to 
the 9th Circuit. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes, who was active in Republican politics, was national president of the 
Federal Bar Assn. from 1954 to 1955 and chairman of the section of Judicial 
Administration of the American Bar Assn. from 1966 to 1967. He also was a 
trustee of the Los Angeles Bar Assn. and in 1971 was given that group's highest 
honor, the Price-Shattuck Award. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife, Elizabeth, a brother, two daughters and eight 
grandchildren.

<P>
Actor Gary Merrill, known for his supporting roles in the movies "Twelve 
O'Clock High" and "All About Eve" and for his stormy marriage to actress Bette 
Davis, died Monday of cancer at age 74. 
</P>
<P>
Merrill, who moved to Maine in 1965 and spent most of his time playing golf and 
reading poetry in schools, died at his home, a small cottage overlooking the 
sea in the wealthy Portland suburb of Falmouth Foreside. 
</P>
<P>
The colorful, spirited actor appeared in 42 films during a career of more than 
40 years. 
</P>
<P>
His last stage appearance was on Broadway in 1980 in a revival of the play 
"Mornings at Seven" with Maureen O'Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
Merrill began his acting career on stage in 1937. His first movie role was in 
"Winged Victory" in 1944. He went on to "Twelve O'Clock High" in 1949 and "All 
About Eve," which starred Miss Davis and won the best-picture Academy Award in 
1950. 
</P>
<P>
Merrill's other movie roles included parts in "Phone Call From a Stranger," 
1953; "Blueprint for Murder," 1953; "Bermuda Affair," 1956 and "Around the 
World Under the Sea," 1966. 
</P>
<P>
On television, he played the gruff but understanding Dr. Gillespie in the 
"Young Dr. Kildare" series and narrated "The Valiant Years" series about 
Winston Churchill. 
</P>
<P>
Merrill met Miss Davis in "All About Eve" -- he played her lover -- and married 
her the day his divorce from his first wife became final. He and Davis divorced 
in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
Merrill, a native of Hartford, Conn., prided himself on an inactive life style, 
telling an interviewer in 1981, "I've spent my life doing as little as 
possible. . . . And I intend to keep doing exactly the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
Merrill is survived by his son, Michael, of Brookline, Mass.; a daughter, 
Margot, of Geneva, N.Y.; a brother, Jerry, of Cape Elizabeth, Maine, and two 
grandchildren.

NATIONAL CITY COUNCILMAN VIOLATED LAW; 
</P>
<P>
PROPERTY: THE CITY ATTORNEY SAYS COUNCILMAN VAN DEVENTER VIOLATED STATE LAW BY 
BUYING AND HOLDING PROPERTY IN CITY REDEVELOPMENT AREAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
National City Councilman Jess E. Van Deventer violated state laws that prohibit 
council members from buying property in redevelopment areas, City Atty. George 
Eiser said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Van Deventer was told in 1986 that he was in "technical" violation 
of the state's conflict-of-interest law as it applies to redevelopment areas 
and was advised to get rid of the controversial properties, Eiser added. In 
1987, Van Deventer told him that he had disposed of the properties, Eiser said. 
</P>
<P>
But Van Deventer never rid himself of the downtown lots. Instead, the 
properties were put in the name of Pacific Professionals Enterprises Inc. -- 
the San Diego accounting firm that handled his finances for about 10 years -- 
while he continued to own the lots, Van Deventer acknowledged Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Van Deventer released amended economic disclosure statements he had 
filed for 1981-88 and revealed that in 1988 he failed to report two-thirds of 
his property holdings and 14 other sources of income. Of the eight additional 
properties that he listed in his amended 1988 statement, seven are in the 
National City Redevelopment Area. 
</P>
<P>
The redevelopment boundaries were drawn in 1981, while Van Deventer was in his 
first council term. The newly listed properties owned by Van Deventer in the 
redevelopment area were purchased from 1981 to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a technical violation of the redevelopment laws that says a councilman 
can't obtain properties in the (redevelopment) area once the boundaries are 
drawn," Eiser said. The law's intent is to prevent council members from voting 
on issues that could affect their own pocketbooks. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the violations are misdemeanors and any charges would have to be 
filed by the district attorney's office. District attorney spokeswoman Linda 
Miller said that a decision on whether to file charges against Van Deventer has 
not been made. 
</P>
<P>
Eiser said that he has again advised Van Deventer to get rid of the properties 
in question. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me in 1987 that he had disposed of the properties and I assumed that 
he had," Eiser said. "It wasn't until a couple of days before (last week's) 
council meeting that I learned that he still owned them." 
</P>
<P>
Van Deventer announced at last Tuesday's City Council meeting that his previous 
economic disclosures "were deficient," and he said he had filed amended 
statements with the city clerk's office and the Fair Political Practices 
Commission in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Van Deventer admitted Wednesday that he was breaking 
the law but blamed his situation on Jerry Segawa, owner of Pacific 
Professionals and his former adviser. Van Deventer also acknowledged that Eiser 
had counseled him in 1986 to dispose of the properties and he admitted putting 
them in the name of Pacific Professionals instead. 
</P>
<P>
"I listened to my adviser (Segawa) and did what he recommended. He recommended 
transferring the properties to the name of Pacific Professionals," Van Deventer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if he was still the real owner of the properties when they were 
transferred to the Pacific Professionals, Van Deventer said: 
</P>
<P>
"Technically, yes. But I was under the assumption that we (he and his wife, 
Sharon) didn't own them. It's the same thing that I told you before. I listened 
to my adviser and did what he recommended." 
</P>
<P>
Segawa, who was fired by Van Deventer two weeks ago, could not be reached for 
comment. His attorney, Michael Adkins, said Friday that Segawa would not 
comment on his relationship with Van Deventer. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of his conflict of interest, Van Deventer will have to abstain from 
voting on all redevelopment matters, Eiser said. 
</P>
<P>
"The only logical solution is for him to dispose of the properties," Eiser 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Van Deventer "has conscientiously" abstained from voting on issues 
that affect other properties that he owns, Eiser added. 
</P>
<P>
Although Van Deventer broke the law by purchasing property in the redevelopment 
area, there is no statute that prevents him from voting on redevelopment 
projects simply because he owns land in the redevelopment area, Eiser said. 
</P>
<P>
"But the feeling is that he has to distance himself as much as possible from 
voting on items or projects that involve the redevelopment agency," said Eiser. 
</P>
<P>
National City Council members double as the Community Development Commission, 
the city's redevelopment agency. 
</P>
<P>
Van Deventer said that he recently hired a group of attorneys to advise him on 
what to do with the lots he owns. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at different options. The attorneys I've hired are doing that. 
They're looking at everything from setting up blind trusts to disposing of them 
all together," Van Deventer said. 
</P>
<P>
He has repeatedly insisted that he and the properties he owns have not profited 
financially from his previous votes on redevelopment matters. 
</P>
<P>
"I've opened my books to everyone because I've got to live with myself. I think 
it's important to be above and beyond question. I got myself in this position, 
and I've got to get these things solved. I'm very concerned that the general 
public should know that they haven't been hurt by anything that I've voted on," 
said Van Deventer. 
</P>
<P>
FPPC officials said they received Van Deventer's amended statements on Friday 
and are still studying them.

SAILORS GET ADDED DUTY -- ASSISTING IN CENSUS COUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of sailors at North Island Naval Air Station has been sworn in to help 
compile census data on the number of active-duty military personnel countywide. 
</P>
<P>
The 150 sailors are the first military counters enlisted to help tally 
personnel stationed in the county as part of the 1990 U.S. Census. 
</P>
<P>
About 700 more sailors and Marines from other bases in the county will join in 
the military count, scheduled for the last week of March and the first week of 
April. 
</P>
<P>
North Island's administrative officer, Lt. Marcia Van Wye, told the group sworn 
in Wednesday that they must perform their regular duties in addition to the 
census chores. 
</P>
<P>
"We already work for a federal agency, and you cannot receive paychecks from 
two separate government agencies," Van Wye told the group. 
</P>
<P>
Results of the military part of the census probably will benefit the civilian 
community more than the military because results could mean more federal money 
and congressional representation, Census Bureau spokesman Dan Conway said. 
</P>
<P>
"The House Congressional Research Service predicts that California will gain 
five or more seats in the House of Representatives," which is reapportioned 
every 10 years based on census data, Conway said. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government allocated $38 billion to cities and counties in 1988 
based on census data, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"In San Diego, that means for every person missed, $150 will be lost by city or 
county government per year over the next 10 years," Conway said. "It's big 
money." 
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau's regional office in San Diego will process the count for 
California and three other Western states. Officials still are seeking part- 
and full-time civilian workers, who can earn up to $20 an hour, to help in the 
count, Conway said.

Mayor-in-the-Air: 
</P>
<P>
Tom Bradley took to the skies in a police helicopter Monday to remind commuters 
via six radio stations to car pool. 
</P>
<P>
"I am up here today to urge all of you -- and I can see you riding into work 
all by yourself -- to take advantage of ride-sharing programs," he intoned. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, of course, already ride-shares. 
</P>
<P>
With his chauffeur. 
</P>
<P>
Figuring that about one out of three people in L.A. claim to be authors -- or 
at least writing screenplays -- the Metropolitan Water District of Southern 
California is soliciting snappy prose for a forthcoming book. 
</P>
<P>
The theme: How to save water. OK, so it's not exactly on a par with the meaning 
of life. 
</P>
<P>
But, points out MWD spokesman Jay Malinowski: "We're in the fourth year of a 
drought period and water availability is going to be real tight this summer, so 
we want people thinking about water conservation." 
</P>
<P>
Authors whose work is included in the tome, "The Book on Water Conservation," 
will receive credit but not pay (neither salary, nor a percentage of the gross 
if it becomes a movie). 
</P>
<P>
The water district has received some not-so-productive suggestions over the 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a woman who said she washed her personal things with her hands then 
used the same water to wash her floor," said Malinowski. "We've had people 
suggest that swimming pool owners be required to put up signs that say, 'Do not 
splash in pool.' One we hear quite a lot is, 'Shower with a friend.' " 
</P>
<P>
The most unusual suggestion was a variation on the cozy shower. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard from a guy who showered with his dog," Malinowski said. 
</P>
<P>
Pass the flea shampoo, Rover. 
</P>
<P>
"Would like to borrow $2,500 for our honeymoon," says the ad in this week's 
Downtown News. "Restitution 24-month period at 7% interest." 
</P>
<P>
Not only is the approach unique, but the parties involved turn out to live in 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
"My girlfriend lives out in California," said the bride-to-be over the 
telephone. "She suggested I try there and maybe I'd find someone in Beverly 
Hills who wanted to help someone out. We both come from broken homes and we're 
really scraping to come up with money for the wedding. As it is now, we're only 
having six people at the wedding." 
</P>
<P>
She said that she and her fiance have both been hit hard by the recession in 
Michigan. But she pointed out their hometown of Bay City, Mich., has one 
distinction. 
</P>
<P>
"Madonna was born here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
What is it about A's-Giants baseball games? 
</P>
<P>
First, there was the Oct. 17 San Francisco quake just before the start of the 
third World Series game. 
</P>
<P>
Now, it turns out the A's and Giants were warming up to play in Monrovia last 
Wednesday when the Upland temblor struck. 
</P>
<P>
Well, not those A's and Giants. These were teams from the local youth baseball 
league. 
</P>
<P>
One other difference too. "There was no way these kids would have the game 
postponed," said league President David Bower. "The quake even pumped 'em up 
more." 
</P>
<P>
The A's won again, by the way.

AL MARTINEZ: UNDER A PLASTIC PALM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Let me begin by saying nothing went wrong at the Nick Edenetti Show. The sound 
system did not fail in mid-song, the spotlight did not go up in smoke and we 
were not plunged into sudden and unexpected darkness. Even the food at Kelbo's 
Polynesian hut was good, if you like baked beans and sticky chicken. 
</P>
<P>
There were other positive factors, not the least of which was that no Frank 
Sinatra lawyer waited to serve Nick with papers for impersonating a living 
legend. Also, the audience consisted of more than the owner, a cook and three 
waiters. In fact, the place was jammed and the show, if not glorious, was at 
least accident-free. 
</P>
<P>
What I'm trying to say is Ol' Brown Eyes is back and he's got it all together. 
</P>
<P>
You remember Nick. He's a saloon singer who does what he calls a Sinatra 
"playography," which is to say a series of Frank's songs interspersed with a 
little of Frank's background. 
</P>
<P>
Nick sounds a lot like Sinatra because he's practiced sounding like him. In the 
right light, he looks a little like him too, all of which creates a proper mood 
for the aforementioned playography. 
</P>
<P>
He began doing the show four years ago in a Burbank restaurant called the China 
Trader. I stopped by one night for Chinese food and was surprised to notice 
they were serving something called an Edenetti. It was on the menu just above 
the Szechwan pork. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Nick was a person, not a food, and he sang his heart out. I 
stayed to listen not because I was captivated by his voice but because I was 
the whole audience. It would be like everyone in Lincoln Center getting up and 
leaving in the middle of a Puccini opera. 
</P>
<P>
When you're an audience of one, you have certain responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
I got interested in Nick because he's the last of a breed, a saloon singer 
playing the small clubs and strip joints from Miami Beach to L.A. Clubs like 
Gio's and El Floridita and now Kelbo's. 
</P>
<P>
He's been doing this for 25 years, and no matter what happens, Nick takes it 
with an equanimity of spirit that is rare among people in show biz. It's a good 
thing. For awhile, disaster seemed to dog his footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
In just about every club he played, either the sound or the lights went dead 
just as he was belting out a big Sinatra number, diminishing his voice to a 
non-amplified whisper and cloaking everyone in confused darkness until the 
circuit-breaker could be reset. 
</P>
<P>
In one show, the power failed nine times, the meatball dinner went cold and 
even Nick seemed ready to give up singing and get a job somewhere as a 
bartender. But, like the guy who sweeps up after the circus elephants, he just 
couldn't leave show biz. 
</P>
<P>
He suddenly popped up doing the Sinatra playography at the Las Palmas Theatre 
in Hollywood. Hardly anyone noticed, however, until Ol' Blue Eyes did Ol' Brown 
Eyes the favor of his life. He threatened to sue him. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for Sinatra warned Edenetti to cease and desist doing the Sinatra 
show, and the owner of Las Palmas shut him down. The irony was exquisite. 
</P>
<P>
Ignored for years by just about everyone, Edenetti was suddenly news from coast 
to coast. The man he'd been impersonating with loving fidelity had, by a threat 
of legal action, turned Nick into a Famous Underdog. 
</P>
<P>
It was like he had been touched by the Holy Spirit. 
</P>
<P>
You know the rest. Sinatra finally agreed to let Nick do his show if he got it 
licensed, which Nick, of course, did. Then he opened last weekend at Kelbo's, I 
mean elbo's. 
</P>
<P>
The "K" light was dead on the club's neon sign. I noticed it as I drove up and 
I thought Not again! Was this going to be another night of power failures and 
dead mikes? Gimme a break. 
</P>
<P>
Kelbo's is a place in West L.A. which affects a Polynesian motif, complete with 
fake palm trees and tall rum drinks with little paper umbrellas floating on 
chunks of pineapple. 
</P>
<P>
It reminded me of a bar in Hawaii where sailors used to go during the Big War 
to meet fat girls in sarongs. In fact, Kelbo's has been around almost since the 
war and, if not famous, it's pretty well-known. 
</P>
<P>
Nick played in a room called the Coco-Bowl. I was seated next to an ersatz tree 
trunk with plastic palm fronds overhead. My wife, who accompanied me, saw me 
looking at the fake fronds, the umbrella drinks and a ring of little lights 
blinking overhead and said, "Poor Nick." 
</P>
<P>
 Au contraire. 
</P>
<P>
 Ol' Brown Eyes seemed right at home among the plastic palms. He sang with the 
enthusiasm of a kid, holding the mike in one hand and moving his free hand in a 
kind of waving motion, like Frank might do if he were playing Kelbo's. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know if I'd want to make a living being someone else, but at least 
Edenetti can say he's doing it his way. 
</P>
<P>
Well, their way.

AILING KILLER WHALE'S DAYS NUMBERED IN LOSING BATTLE AGAINST RARE DISEASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
Knootka, the ailing 8,500-pound killer whale, has not responded to last-ditch 
efforts to treat a rare fungal infection that has been further complicated by a 
bacterial infection, Sea World officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Officials believe Knootka, one of three adult killer whales at Sea World, will 
probably not survive her bout with the illness, which was first diagnosed in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
The chances of Knootka surviving are worsened by her relatively old age, which 
is mid- to late-20s, said Dr. Jim McBain, Sea World veterinarian. Killer 
whales' life expectancy is 25 to 35 years. It is not known how much longer the 
whale has to live, McBain said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all dying, but she is dying faster than most of us. If she died 
tonight, I would not be surprised -- she is a very sick animal," McBain said. 
</P>
<P>
But Knootka remains a good patient, demonstrating no signs of pain or 
discomfort. She has a large appetite for herring, mackerel, smelt and squid, 
which she can eat whenever she wants. Knootka also has become "good friends" 
with the newly arrived killer whale Kasatka, a 4,000-pound female. Kasatka 
spent two years with Knootka before being moved to Texas for a breeding 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"She is showing a desire to live," McBain said. 
</P>
<P>
In December, Knootka became the first whale to receive itraconazole, an 
experimental drug approved for human use in Europe. It was hoped that the 
medication would battle what doctors said was a rare fungal infection. After 
five weeks of treatment, Knootka's appetite returned and a lesion in her mouth 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, however, it became clear that a bacterial infection had also 
stricken Knootka. Bacterial infections are not unusual among older whales, and 
Knootka' immune system, already weakened by the fungal infection, fell prey. 
Her medical condition is similar to that of an elderly patient, weakened by one 
illness who then succumbs to pneumonia, McBain said. 
</P>
<P>
"Bacteria is common in the body already. When whales are young and healthy, 
those bacteria don't cause problems," McBain said. 
</P>
<P>
Knootka, who has been at Sea World since 1986, hails from the waters 
surrounding British Columbia. Before her San Diego debut, she was at Marine 
Land aquatic park in Niagara Falls. 
</P>
<P>
McBain is continuing to give the whale itraconazole, as well as antibiotics, 
vitamins and minerals. Her condition is monitored around the clock. After her 
death, an autopsy will be conducted to determine the effectiveness of the 
various medications, McBain said. 
</P>
<P>
"She will die eventually, but we are hoping it will be later and not sooner," 
he said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: EL CAJON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An El Cajon man pleaded innocent Monday to charges that he tried to murder a 
prostitute after a sexual encounter. 
</P>
<P>
James Morris Jackson, 23, was arrested Thursday by the Metropolitan Homicide 
Task Force, the agency investigating 42 mystery killings of women, mostly 
prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
The women have been killed since 1985 and their bodies dumped in remote areas 
of East and North County. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson is charged in an attack on a prostitute Feb. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Bonnie Dumanis said the investigation is continuing, but 
declined to say whether Jackson would be charged with other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson is charged with attempted murder for allegedly choking a young woman 
unconscious in a remote area after he allegedly forced her into a sex act. He 
is also charged with robbery, assault with a deadly weapon and false 
imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson shook his head before Municipal Judge William Woodward in denying the 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
According to an arrest warrant affidavit made public Monday, the prostitute 
said Jackson picked her up at 21st and Market streets on Feb. 26. After going 
to a remote area, Jackson gave her $4 and she said she wanted more money, the 
affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman claimed she was choked and forced to perform a sexual act before 
passing out, the affidavit said. She wrote down the car license number after 
she was dropped off in San Diego and gave police the information. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson works in the maintenance department at the Navy Public Works Center on 
North Island, said his attorney, Robert Carlin. Bail was set at $55,000. A 
preliminary hearing was set for March 16.

Jason Eimers, 19, was shot about 6:30 p.m. Sunday after he answered a knock at 
his door in the 700 block of Flora Drive, Officer Chip Morin said. Eimers was 
taken to Scripps Memorial Hospital-La Jolla. The bullet was not removed and is 
lodged near his spine, Morin said.

<P>
Although police said they have determined that the shooting was not 
gang-related, they do not have a motive or any suspects, Morin said.

<TEXT>
<P>
A private contractor on Monday began preparations for removing up to 7,000 
cubic yards of contaminated soil from the Chatham Brothers toxic waste site, 
where a petroleum recycling business operated for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Removal of the tainted soil is expected to begin next week and be completed by 
the end of April, said Allan Hirsch, spokesman for the toxics division of the 
state Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
Excavation up to 14 feet deep will occur in the most heavily contaminated area, 
which measures about 150 feet by 200 feet, Hirsch said. The contractor, O.H. 
Materials Corp., will replace the contaminated material with fresh soil. 
</P>
<P>
Chatham Brothers, located southwest of the corner of Gamble Lane and Bernardo 
Avenue, was identified in 1981 as a toxic waste site by county and state health 
officials.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: LAKESIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The president of the San Diego chapter of Hells Angels was sentenced Monday to 
five years in federal prison for possession of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Guy Russell Castiglione, 40, of Lakeside, was also ordered to pay a $100,000 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
Castiglione pleaded guilty in December to possession of methamphetamine with 
intent to distribute. About two pounds of the drug were found in his 
girlfriend's purse on May 13. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing for the girlfriend, Kathleen Pirelli, 21, also of Lakeside, was 
delayed until Thursday. She pleaded guilty to using a phone during a drug 
transaction. Her attorney said he would call Castiglione as a witness at her 
sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
Before imposing the sentence, U.S. District Judge John Rhoades said to 
Castiglione, "What do you have to say about mending your ways? You have a 
terrible record." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have anything to say," Castiglione replied. 
</P>
<P>
Castiglione was convicted of racketeering in connection with the 1977 shooting 
deaths of three members of the rival Mongols motorcycle gang. He also has a 
previous drug conviction.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE REFUSES TO HALT SEX CHURCH INQUIRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge on Monday refused for the third time to issue a court order 
barring police from investigating a Canyon Country couple who operate a sex 
church, which prosecutors say is a front for prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge William M. Byrne Jr. had twice refused to grant the court 
order requested by Will and Mary Ellen Tracy, the self-proclaimed high priest 
and priestess of the Church of the Most High Goddess. 
</P>
<P>
The Tracys argued that the First Amendment shields their church, which includes 
sex acts in its rituals, from prosecution and have said that they will continue 
to practice their religion. Police said the Tracys are practicing prostitution 
because male worshipers make donations, often cash, to participate in sexual 
rituals with Mary Ellen Tracy. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles Municipal Court jury believed police and convicted Mary Ellen 
Tracy in September on two counts of prostitution and one count of running a 
house of prostitution. Her husband was convicted of running a house of 
prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
The Tracys are free on bail while they appeal.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 KILLED, 5 HURT IN CRASH OF CAR, TANKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two people died and five others -- including three children -- were critically 
injured Monday night when a car rammed the back of a gasoline or oil tanker 
truck on the Golden State Freeway in Sun Valley, authorities reported. 
</P>
<P>
The identities of the two who died were unavailable late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Two children were taken to Children's Hospital. The other child and the two 
adults were taken to Pacifica Hospital, all in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
The car was "wedged under the truck" and passengers were trapped inside 
following the 9:45 p.m. collision in the northbound lanes near Wicks Road, said 
Kathy Shorten of the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Shorten said early reports indicated the tanker was leaking either gasoline or 
diesel fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Five engine companies, five ambulances and a rescue helicopter were dispatched 
to the scene, said Jim Wells, a Los Angeles City Fire Department spokesman.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AIRPORT TRYING TO BUY LAND NEAR RUNWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority on Monday tentatively approved 
applying for funds to buy 20.7 acres of land parallel to the airport's 
north-south runway to provide a greater safety setback for planes. 
</P>
<P>
The long strip of land east of the main runway includes the Lockheed Corp. 
firefighters building, which would be removed if the airport takes possession, 
authority staff members said. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated $20-million purchase price of the land would be paid by the 
Federal Aviation Administration, said airport spokesman Victor J. Gill. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase would conform to an FAA policy that encourages airports to control 
all land within 750 feet of runways, according to a staff report. 
</P>
<P>
The strip of land is not connected to any of the properties under consideration 
for a new terminal site, Gill said.

$3-MILLION OUTRAGE -- AND COUNTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors takes a back seat to no one when it 
comes to keeping a lean, mean budget. Need more county mental-health services? 
Tough. There was a $3- million budget shortfall. Sorry, the majority of the 
board told mental-health-care advocates pleading for mercy, we just can't 
squeeze another nickel out of the budget. 
</P>
<P>
But wait! The magicians on the board now seem to have found $3 million. For the 
mentally ill? Forget it. To shelter homeless people on cold winter nights? In 
your dreams. The board has found 3 million taxpayer dollars -- and counting -- 
for something truly dear to their hearts: their own political hides. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar total mounts as the county continues its legal battle to fight the 
righteous, and the inevitable: a redistricting lawsuit aimed at providing fair 
political representation for the county's 3 million Latinos. The county is 
fighting not only the American Civil Liberties Union and the Mexican American 
Legal Defense and Educational Fund but the U.S. Justice Department as well. 
</P>
<P>
According to the county, the lawsuit is not about fair representation for 
Latinos but about preserving local control and home rule. Apparently, the 
county does not want the federal government to impose its oddball notions of 
representative government on the all-white board -- a description that still 
holds for most, Supervisor Pete Schabarum's recently trumpeted Latino heritage 
notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
The board majority's priorities are sadly evident; its rationale for paying a 
private law firm $245 an hour completely transparent. What the county is paying 
lawyers for one hour to defend the indefensible could feed, clothe, counsel and 
give health care to 10 homeless children every day. That fact is nothing short 
of shameful. 
</P>
<P>
The federal trial is expected to be over in a few weeks. The county has already 
declared that if it loses, it will appeal, which is a signal that it apparently 
is ready to spend an endless amount of taxpayer money to maintain the 
supervisors' political fiefdoms. Whatever the legal outcome, the board 
majority's decision to fight a costly political battle -- while poor-mouthing 
the homeless and the mentally ill -- is a memory that should be carried to the 
polls in future elections by every voter of conscience.

RAPID INCREASE IN POPULATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial was both moving and important. As you suggest, contraceptives 
can help to avoid this rapidly increasing problem. 
</P>
<P>
But contraception is not, as you state, the only way to deal with the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the prejudice in so many societies against lesbians and gay men is a 
means of forcing them to act as if they were heterosexual, and reproduce, or 
suffer punishment because they do not, ordinarily, have children. The twin 
goals of population stability and respect for human rights are both violated by 
insisting that homosexual people act against their own sexual orientation and 
enter heterosexual relationships. 
</P>
<P>
If we state that we wish to respect human rights and we believe that 
overpopulation is a real problem, we act against our own self-interest by 
continuing to stigmatize homosexuality. It is only in a world where 
reproduction is the only and overriding good that homosexuality deserves this 
sort of intolerance and misunderstanding.

RAPID INCREASE IN POPULATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As per news item of Feb. 22, an increase of 250,000 people per day is 
frightening and mind-boggling. 
</P>
<P>
Poverty breeds uncontrollable population increase and unchecked population 
explosion perpetuates poverty. 
</P>
<P>
It is a vicious cycle. 
</P>
<P>
Britain, France, Spain, Belgium and Portugal are some of the old colonial 
powers who ruthlessly exploited their colonies and have done irreparable damage 
to their economies. Shouldn't this past colonial powers bear some 
responsibility for the mess they have left behind in their past colonies and 
help these poor nations in their struggle against population increase and 
poverty? 
</P>
<P>
It is in the interest of the whole world that all rich nations join the poor 
nations in their fight against this population menace.

ROCKWELL SAFETY PLAN CRITICIZED A SECOND TIME; 
</P>
<P>
READINESS: A DOCTORS' GROUP SAYS THE COMPANY IS BADLY MISREPRESENTING ITS 
ABILITY TO COPE WITH RADIATION INJURIES FROM A SPILL AT THE SANTA SUSANA LAB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second time in recent months, critics have accused Rockwell 
International of giving the government false assurances about local readiness 
to cope with radiation injuries if there were an accident at the Santa Susana 
Field Laboratory west of Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
The charge was leveled by Los Angeles Physicians for Social Responsibility, one 
of several groups fighting Rockwell's application to extend for one year the 
special nuclear materials license for Santa Susana's hot lab. 
</P>
<P>
The Rockwell application to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission includes a 
contingency plan that "contains numerous material false statements" about 
arrangements between Rockwell and local hospitals to treat radiation accident 
victims, according to a brief the physicians group filed with the NRC. 
</P>
<P>
It is the second time the accuracy of Rockwell's contingency plan has been an 
issue in the case. Previously, discrepancies were found in claims about 
arrangements for ambulance services, although Rockwell described these as 
"minor errors." 
</P>
<P>
In the most recent case, the physicians group said, an investigation by four of 
its members found that the contingency plan "badly misrepresents the 
arrangements -- or lack of arrangements -- made for medical assistance." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Sewell, a spokesman for Rockwell's Rocketdyne division, which operates the 
Santa Susana lab in the Simi Hills, declined to comment Monday, citing the 
company's policy of responding first to the NRC judge presiding in the case. 
Sewell said Rockwell will reply "to those specific items" when it files its 
brief in the case next month. 
</P>
<P>
The physicians group cited an assertion in the contingency plan that both the 
medical director and director of nursing at nearby Humana Hospital-West Hills 
were trained in treatment of radioactively contaminated patients at the 
government's nuclear reservation at Oak Ridge, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
The physicians group said that the medical director who received the training 
is now based at another Humana hospital in Northern California. That was 
confirmed by a hospital official. 
</P>
<P>
"One must question the adequacy of those arrangements if Rockwell is apparently 
unaware that the medical director whom they had arranged to have trained in 
handling radioactively contaminated patients is no longer at the hospital," the 
brief said. 
</P>
<P>
Five other hospitals listed in the Rockwell plan as "capable of radiation 
accident management" were found by the group to lack special equipment and 
training, according to the brief. 
</P>
<P>
"In summary, of the six hospitals identified . . . as having the training and 
equipment to handle radioactively contaminated patients, none were accurately 
described by Rockwell. . . . There is only one hospital, not six as claimed by 
Rockwell, capable of handling contaminated patients, and it has only one 
trained staff person, not two as claimed," said the brief dated Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
The hot lab is a heavily shielded workshop used to handle highly radioactive 
materials by remote control. After originally seeking a 10-year renewal of the 
hot lab's license, Rockwell announced last fall it would settle for a one-year 
extension to complete one more nuclear experiment before cleaning up and 
closing the hot lab. 
</P>
<P>
But opponents are trying to block this project and get Rockwell to put in 
writing its statement that it will halt nuclear activities permanently. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations by the physicians group revive the controversy that surfaced 
last fall over arrangements for fire and ambulance services. Don Wallace, a Los 
Angeles fire captain and head of the anti-nuclear Rocketdyne Cleanup Coalition, 
said last September he had checked statements in the plan about ambulance 
services and found them "rife with false assurances." 
</P>
<P>
The NRC later said that some arrangements cited by Rockwell "were apparently 
those that existed" in a prior version of the plan and had not been updated. 
</P>
<P>
In December, Rockwell released a revised contingency plan to correct the 
errors, saying they were minor. It is that updated plan, however, the 
physicians group now contends is inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
In another development in the case, Rockwell has asked NRC Law Judge Peter B. 
Bloch to strike major parts of the opponents' case as "irrelevant and 
immaterial" to the licensing issues. 
</P>
<P>
The Rockwell motion, dated March 1, is directed at the lengthy briefs in which 
six groups and individuals last month explained their opposition to the license 
request. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell asked Bloch to rule inadmissible the entire briefs of the Southern 
</P>
<P>
California Federation of Scientists, the Susana Knolls Homeowners Assn. and 
intervenors Estelle Lit and Jerome E. Raskin. 
</P>
<P>
The company also sought to strike parts of the briefs of Jon Scott and 
Physicians for Social Responsibility -- although not its discussion of alleged 
inaccuracies in the contingency plan. The company did not ask to strike any of 
the brief of the anti-nuclear Committee to Bridge the Gap. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell also asked Bloch to formally dismiss two other intervenors -- Don 
Wallace and the Natural Resources Defense Council -- who said they were 
dropping out of the case because the other groups represented their interests. 
</P>
<P>
The intervenors have 10 days to reply before Bloch rules on the motion. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell said some arguments should be stricken as irrelevant, and that others 
were inadmissible because opponents failed to identify specific NRC regulations 
or deficiencies in the application. 
</P>
<P>
Other issues raised several times in different briefs should be stricken to 
avoid redundancy, Rockwell maintained.

THOSE WHIZ KIDS OF SCIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One way a society defines itself is in its decisions about behavior it will 
punish and behavior it will reward. More often than not these days, public 
discussion about reward, punishment and America's values is focused on making 
points in political campaigns and not on identifying merit. So it is refreshing 
to think of values in the same frame of reference as that used by such rituals 
as the Westinghouse Science Talent Search, whose winners were announced late 
Monday with appropriate fanfare. 
</P>
<P>
The Westinghouse contest is an annual event of more consequence, if less 
celebrity, to the American future than the Oscars or any of a dozen other 
spotlights on achievement. Students who have yet to see their high school 
diplomas are formally feted for their wizardry in fields from genetics to 
microbiology. The thrilling accomplishments of these young hotshots inevitably 
serve to reassure the nation's almost always-hysterical older folk that the 
future of the nation is not in such bad hands after all. 
</P>
<P>
This year two Southern Californians stood out. David Ruchien Liu, 16, from 
Riverside, and Royce Yung-Tze Peng, 17, of Rancho Palos Verdes, finished among 
the top 10 winners, the first time in four years that state students finished 
in that stratospheric elite. No doubt the impressive achievements of Liu and 
Peng say more about the brains and determination of these ambitious teen-agers 
than anything else and scarcely provides us with the right to crow about 
California. That would be to trivialize this grand moment. Still, it's nice to 
know that such talent is flowering here, among teachers who have not given up 
and fellow students who cannot but help be inspired by the excellence of the 
achievement. And among adults who can be moved by recognition of such young 
talent even after many years and much cynicism have left them generally moved 
by little else.

HOUSING WON'T CURE BROKEN LIVES; 
</P>
<P>
HOMELESS: FRAMING THE ISSUE IN TERMS OF SHELTER ALONE DIVERTS RESOURCES FROM 
THE BIGGEST NEED -- REHABILITATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HOLSINGER, The Rev. Mark Holsinger is executive director of the Los 
Angeles Mission. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mitch Snyder has found a new way to distort the homeless issue. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder, a homeless activist and head of the Washington-based Community for 
Creative Non-Violence, is urging the homeless to boycott the 1990 Census. His 
argument: Only a fraction of the homeless will be counted, yielding a number 
that the Bush Administration will use to prove that the problem of housing 
isn't as serious as thought. 
</P>
<P>
To some, Snyder's boycott may seem strategic, almost rational in calling the 
Administration to task on cuts in federal housing assistance. In reality, it's 
just another tactic aimed at persuading the public that homelessness is a 
housing issue and that more government funding (which would depend, of course, 
on higher estimates of the homeless population) will solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, homelessness is a symptom of many complex problems: mental illness, 
emotional instability, chronic substance abuse, illiteracy, unemployment 
(largely due to a lack of job skills) and, most basic of all, breakdown of the 
family structure. 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of homeless in the United States are individuals who are 
unable to function successfully in society and who require intensive 
rehabilitation. And while they may not fit the stereotypes of the older, 
alcoholic male, neither are they mostly young families thrust out onto the 
streets by a soured economy and a stingy Administration. 
</P>
<P>
More than a lack of housing, the crack-cocaine epidemic is the single biggest 
cause of the great leap in the numbers of homeless people on the streets. And 
it is why the average age of the homeless has fallen from around 40 to under 28 
in less than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, too many "homeless activists" would prefer that the whole story 
go untold, largely for fear that it would result in a decline in public 
sympathy for the homeless. And while they may have cause for that concern, the 
tragic result of continuing to frame homelessness as a housing issue is that 
resources are continually channeled into construction of more shelters and 
low-income housing instead of the rehabilitation services that the homeless so 
desperately need. 
</P>
<P>
By framing the issue in terms of housing, and attempting to manipulate the 
homeless through his boycott, Snyder may succeed in advancing his personal 
brand of social activism but will do little to advance the needs of those he 
supposedly represents. 
</P>
<P>
After 25 years of working with the homeless -- day in, day out as the director 
of the Los Angeles Mission and with similar organizations in Northern 
California -- I know that shelter and housing alone will do little more than 
warehouse the homeless in their own misery. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the majority of the chronically homeless would be hard pressed to 
keep a home if they received one. Because of emotional problems, substance 
abuse and low self-esteem -- which is more the cause of their plight than the 
result of it -- they generally do not have the wherewithal to manage their 
lives successfully. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder or others cannot be allowed to frame the issue in such a way that the 
numbers become more important than the real needs of the people. While the 
census is a positive first step -- a commendable effort to count a segment of 
the population that has been overlooked in the past -- we must resist the urge 
to fixate on how many people are homeless. The numbers simply give us a body 
count of people with no fixed addresses. They tell us nothing about their pain, 
their desperation or their needs. 
</P>
<P>
At the Los Angeles Mission, we will do everything we can to assist the Census 
Bureau on the night of the count. Gaining some sense of the size of the problem 
is important, even though everyone agrees that the census count will be far 
from totally accurate. And frankly, we believe the estimates, which range from 
250,000 to 3 million, have often been inflated to attract more government 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
The important point is that whatever the count of the homeless population, 
whatever estimate any group gives, defining the scope of the problem will never 
mean that the solution is simply to pump more federal funds into more housing. 
</P>
<P>
We do not receive government money, so perhaps that's why we are concerned less 
about counting the homeless and more about rehabilitating them through 
intensive counseling, job training and re-creating a sense of family and love 
that they have lost or never had.

WHAT'S LEFT FOR THE LATIN LEFT?; 
</P>
<P>
NICARAGUA: THE SANDINISTAS' LOSS IS A MILESTONE FOR MODERNIZING SOCIALIST 
IDEALS IN THE FACE OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CRISIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

relations at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and a visiting 
research professor at UC Berkeley.

<P>
The election upset in Nicaragua is important from many perspectives, and will 
be a topic for commentary and analysis for some time to come. It is a watershed 
in Nicaraguan history, and a decisive event for Central America as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
Less obviously, the defeat of the Sandinista government is a milestone for the 
Latin American left, which is living through its most traumatic crisis ever. 
Its response to the events in Nicaragua, along with those in the Soviet Union 
and Eastern Europe, will determine whether the left will remain a major 
reference point in this hemisphere or pass into irrelevance. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Ortega's defeat is the most shattering setback the Latin left has 
suffered since Salvador Allende's overthrow by the military in Chile in 1973. 
It is sure to provoke soul-searching, identity crises and downright depression 
throughout the left side of the hemisphere's political spectrum. It should, 
because only then will the political forces ranging from the moderate 
left-of-center to the radical fringe be able to come to terms with the 
monumental changes under way in the world. Only through such a process can it 
hope to benefit from what should be an exceptionally and paradoxically 
favorable situation for its future prospects. 
</P>
<P>
The most immediate explanation for the Sandinistas' loss seems evident: The 
Nicaraguan people, fed up with 10 years of war, apparently believed that the 
only way to end the Contra offensive and the U.S. embargo, and the resulting 
pervasive economic degradation of the country, was through U.S. acceptance of 
the election results, which inevitably meant an opposition victory. The 
Nicaraguans were probably right in believing that a vote for Ortega meant 
continued American hostility; they are probably wrong in thinking that a vote 
for Violeta Chamorro ensures American financial largess. 
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan revolutionaries must also attribute their defeat to more general 
and long-term trends that are affecting Latin America as a whole. The 
hemisphere is experiencing an extraordinary conjunction of major democratic 
advances and economic and social regression. The Contra war, the U.S. embargo 
and economic mismanagement (partly due to the war and the embargo) have turned 
Nicaragua into a wasteland. But the country's affliction is simply an extreme 
manifestation of a process that reaches far beyond Nicaragua's borders. The 
subcontinent in its entirety has been going through a dramatic crisis 
characterized by economic stagnation, social regression and massive 
decapitalization. Throughout the 1980s, per-capita GDP growth grew only in 
Colombia and did not fall only in Chile and the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
The coincidence of economic decline and democratic gain bodes disaster for 
incumbents in general and in particular for political entities identified with 
the status quo. In Latin America, that means the military (Brazil, Chile, 
Argentina, Uruguay), or one-party rule (Mexico, Cuba, Nicaragua), or two-party 
monopoly (Venezuela, Colombia). The coincidence of those two trends had 
disastrous results for the Sandinistas, but in theory it should be encouraging 
for the left in the long term. That promise, however, could be aborted by the 
other underlying trend that brought about Daniel Ortega's demise: the 
transformation of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The end of the Cold War also means the elimination of what was known as the 
"socialist bloc." More importantly, it entails the dissolution of the socialist 
paradigm, which over the years has been broadly adapted, with additions or 
subtractions that each party, government or author wished to apply. Yet the 
collapse of the paradigm in the Soviet Bloc has not spared the Latin left: To 
the extent that any movement or regime in Latin America is perceived as being 
identified with the Soviet Union or Cuba, it now pays dearly with public 
opinion or at the polls. Conversely, it is no surprise that where the Latin 
left or left-of-center is strongest today -- Brazil and Mexico -- it is also 
totally newly born, home-grown and devoid of any ties, debts or emotional 
attachment to the "socialist camp." 
</P>
<P>
The end of the paradigm has plunged this hemisphere's orthodox left into a 
collective depression. Having indefinitely postponed dealing with issues such 
as democracy, sound economic management and relations with the United States, 
it found itself in a totally untenable, indefensible position as the socialist 
world collapsed and the Cold War came to an end. In this sense, the 
Sandinistas' commitment to a fair election, their acceptance of defeat and 
their restructuring as an institutional opposition is a positive development. 
It obliges the Sandinistas to take democracy seriously -- like it or not -- and 
not just tactically. Above all, it gives them a marvelous opportunity to remove 
the "Soviet-Cuban" handicap, and once again be and be seen by their countrymen 
and neighbors as a purely Nicaraguan, fully democratic movement. Such a 
full-fledged commitment to democratic practices is something that the 
traditional Latin American left, with the notable exception of Salvador 
Allende, had been until now unwilling or unable to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
If the Sandinista Front's acceptance of opposition status is fully carried out, 
it will allow the comandantes to renew ties with their followers -- as many as 
are left -- and be rid of the arrogant and authoritarian habits they acquired 
over 10 years of nearly absolute rule. It will force them to learn once again 
how to struggle for power, but under different rules: those they themselves set 
and bequeathed to their nation, in a gesture that was perhaps forced upon them 
but is nonetheless undisputably noble and generous. They have become an example 
that other pending processes of democratization would do well to follow. In one 
case, Cuba, it would save the revolution's place in history; in Mexico, it 
would spare the country a near-certain tragedy.

CALLING TO THE FAITHFUL ON ALIEN SHORES

By LINDA BLANDFORD, Linda Blandford, for years a columnist for the British 
newspaper the Guardian, will be writing about Southern California from time to 
time.

<TEXT>
<P>
In a Sizzler restaurant on South Vermont, two elderly men sit at their plates 
of salad in the early evening and go over their memories, as brothers do when 
they are close. The balmy nights by the Nile, the pyramids in the distance, the 
moonlight and warm breezes while walking through Cairo. "You never know on what 
soil you will die," Muslims say. Who could have known then of this anonymous, 
faraway night? 
</P>
<P>
Between them, the Drs. Hassan and Maher Hathout have 24 letters after their 
surname. They come from a tradition where such things are honored -- not made 
rich necessarily. But treated "with due respect." Their father was a 
schoolteacher, a headmaster in the last years; he, too, was treated "with due 
respect." And they have come to a land where, as they see it, Muslims are 
largely presented as Urban II presented them in the 11th Century. "They are 
dogs," said the Pope. "Chaff for eternal fire." He was, Dr. Hassan Hathout 
points out with gentle irony, known as Urban the Blessed. 
</P>
<P>
In these days of the Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan, the intifada, Iran, it 
is hard not to think of the Islam of the fist: desert-spawned, military-minded, 
lean, ascetic. And as hard to put that image together with the courtly Drs. 
Hathout, leaders of the Islamic Center of Southern California, cheek by jowl 
with the Sizzler. 
</P>
<P>
They were at the mosque for the last prayers of the day. Just before 7, the 
call to the faithful rang around the long, low rooms of the converted storage 
center. Five times a day, the same call rings out from mosques into city 
streets all over the world -- in Arabian lands, Afghanistan, Malaysia. Not 
Vermont Avenue, however: "Who is interested in that noise?" says Maher Hathout, 
with the worried care of a homeowner not wanting to wake his neighbor with a 
lawn mower. 
</P>
<P>
The faithful, when they arrive, present a rare array of colors, sizes, 
costumes. Pakistanis like slender greyhounds, swarthy barrel-chests from the 
East, black American converts. There are as many walks as costumes: Some 
swagger, others scuttle like crabs. Hassan Hathout, with the bearing of a stiff 
British colonel, contrasts with his younger brother, Maher, who rolls from side 
to side like a stately galleon. Shoes, heaped outside the prayer room, tell a 
score of tales: cheap flip-flops, down-at-heel clunkers, street-smart sneakers, 
thin Hollywood loafers. How great a leveler it is when men kneel, forehead to 
the ground -- a line of backsides, humbled and equal before God. 
</P>
<P>
Ten thousand families belong to the center. On Sunday, 1,500 crowd in to study, 
talk and pray. They come to forget their fears outside, to forget the hatred 
that has torn apart homelands and brought many to these alien shores. Alas, 
there are Americans who see their own land thus; they have found another way 
through Islam. 
</P>
<P>
Even here, there are whiffs of the desert that gave life to Islam: the 
courtesy, one man to another, born of a time when to be without others meant 
certain death. The tradition of hospitality lingers. In the desert, the 
traveler was always offered protection and care. In the graceful arches 
remembered in the tacky wooden alcove, in the beauty of the Koranic script, the 
past endures. 
</P>
<P>
"What do I miss in Egypt?" Maher Hathout sighs wistfully. "The intimacy -- 
worrying about your cousins, your cousins' cousins, your cousins' cousins' 
cousins. . . . " Who can wonder that so many in the desert that is a modern 
city have found refuge in this other brotherhood? 
</P>
<P>
Maher Hathout came to America long ago, to Buffalo in 1960. Buffalo? From 
Cairo? "It was not a piece of cake," he says with masterly understatement. Now 
he has his brother and his brother's family. 
</P>
<P>
All of his life, Hassan Hathout dreamed of giving his time to Islamic studies, 
and to reaching out to be understood: "So people know that we're not all 
terrorists, not murderers, not to be feared -- but nice gentlemen." He and his 
family moved here two years ago, after 20 years as a professor of obstetrics in 
Kuwait, 20 years of honor, "with due respect." It is not as strange a move as 
it seems. He has always been an outsider -- an Egyptian in the British Empire, 
a non-Kuwaiti in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole Earth is my homeland," Hassan Hathout says. "It is God's Earth, not 
man's." Others who felt as he did roamed here once. The Earth, they said, was 
not theirs to sell. Perhaps, after all, the Drs. Hathout are just coming home.

KINGS FALL TO 17 POINTS OUT OF FIRST;

PRO HOCKEY: THEY LOSE TO DIVISION-LEADING CALGARY, 5-0. WEBSTER IS CLEARED TO

<P>
First, the good news: Tom Webster has been cleared to resume coaching. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the bad news: He has to coach the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
Webster, medically cleared after ear surgery two weeks ago, will be behind the 
bench Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
He will resume control of a team that returns winless from a three-game trip, 
the latest loss administered by the Calgary Flames Monday night, 5-0, before an 
Olympic Saddledome sellout crowd of 20,107. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings have lost four of their last five and nine of 13 to drop to 28-33-6, 
a full 17 points behind the Smythe Division-leading Flames (33-21-13) with 13 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing that stands between the fourth-place Kings and elimination from 
the playoffs is the Vancouver Canucks (20-38-11), a team playing worse than the 
kings. 
</P>
<P>
But not much worse. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, the Kings' problem was their defense. But now, the offense has 
sunk to samelevel. 
</P>
<P>
On the three-game trip, the Kings were outscored, 19-5. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually after a game, I never know who scored for us," said co-interim coach 
Rick Wilson. "Tonight, I had no trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"Calgary did a good job of keeping us out of the slot and the scoring areas. We 
did a lot of bobbing and weaving, but came up empty." 
</P>
<P>
It was the Kings' seventh consecutive road loss. The last time they won away 
from home was at Calgary Feb. 6. 
</P>
<P>
This was also the place they suffered their only other shutout of the season. 
The score that night, Oct. 25, was also 5-0, and the goalie was Rick Wamsley, 
same as Monday. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Wamsley faced 26 shots. 
</P>
<P>
King rookie goalie Robb Stauber, making only his second NHL start, faced 30 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
In his NHL debut Friday night, he gave up six Winnipeg Jet goals on 13 shots. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a struggle since the day I got here," said Stauber, who was sent 
back to the Kings' New Haven Nighthawk farm club after the game. "I haven't 
instilled confidence in the guys and that's my job. It's not like I haven't 
tried. I just couldn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson thought that perhaps the velocity of the shots at this level had caught 
Stauber off guard. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like he wasn't ready on several of them," Wilson said. "He looked 
good around the net, but maybe he got a little nonchalant on the longer shots." 
</P>
<P>
Stauber, informed of Wilson's velocity theory, didn't buy it. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen guys down there shoot like that," he said, "although not like up 
here where everybody can. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight, it felt like the net was the size of one on a soccer field. I felt 
like I was full of holes." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Ranheim got the opening goal, his 22nd of the season, at 2:18 of the first 
period. Ranheim's 25-foot shot from the left side sailed over Stauber's stick. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the first of two scores via deflections, the puck going in off Joel 
Otto's stick after Ranheim had fired from the left circle. The goal, Otto's 
11th, came 57 seconds into the second period. 
</P>
<P>
After Joe Nieuwendyk's first of two goals at 13:38 of the period, Tim Hunter 
deflected Dana Murzyn's shot into the net at 14:58. Hunter got credit for his 
second goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Nieuwendyk closed out the scoring in the final period with his team-leading 
39th goal. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Joining Robb Stauber on the trip back to New Haven is left winger Scott 
Bjugstad. Both players had to be sent back by today to be eligible for the 
American Hockey League playoffs. . . . Tom Webster hasn't coached since leaving 
in the middle of a Feb. 3 game against Calgary because of dizziness, caused by 
an inner-ear problem. Webster's troubles began when he fell in the shower in 
his Edmonton hotel room Jan. 26. He underwent surgery Feb. 20 to stop leakage 
of fluid from the ear. 
</P>
<P>
Webster has spent the past three days working with goalie Kelly Hrudey. Hrudey 
skipped this trip to further recuperate from a bout with mononucleosis that has 
sidelined him for much of the last six weeks. "He looks a lot stronger," 
Webster said. "He doesn't feel anywhere near as bad as he's been." Hrudey will 
probably be Ron Scott's backup Wednesday against the Montreal Canadiens and, 
according to Webster, could get the start Saturday against the Pittsburgh 
Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
Still no word on the trade front. King General Manager Rogie Vachon spent all 
of Monday on the phone, trying to swing a deal for a defenseman. Since Wayne 
Gretzky is an untouchable and Vachon has already declared the team's leading 
goal-scorer, Luc Robitaille, won't be moved, the team doesn't appear to have a 
lot to offer. The trading deadline is noon today.

SOCKERS TRADE KARIC TO CRUNCH FOR WRIGHT

<P>
Paul Wright, a forward for the Cleveland Crunch who was claimed in last 
summer's free agent draft after he was left unprotected by the Sockers, has 
been traded back to the Sockers and will arrive Wednesday, Wright's agent Scott 
Simpson said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
According to sources, the Sockers have traded forward Zoran Karic in a 
one-for-one exchange for Wright. Karic, the Sockers' leading scorer with 37 
goals during the regular season last year, has had his share of differences 
with Socker Coach Ron Newman during 2 1/2 seasons with the team. He has been 
the subject of trade rumors since last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson said Wright called him last week and told him he had heard rumors of 
the trade. Wright, Simpson said, was called by Cleveland General Manager Al 
Miller Monday and told he had been traded to San Diego. Wright is under orders 
from Simpson not to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Socker owner Ron Fowler wouldn't comment either, saying only: "I think we're 
very close to a deal." 
</P>
<P>
Socker President Ron Cady, who sources said met with Miller in Tacoma Monday to 
finalize the deal, also wouldn't comment but said he hoped to make an 
announcement at today's Sportswriters-Sportcasters Assn. meeting at San Diego 
Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Socker Coach Ron Newman could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
In Karic, the Sockers have given up a proven veteran who has the ability to 
score the elegant goal from outside the penalty box. Yet Karic, tied with 
midfielder Waad Hirmez for the team lead with 22 goals, has often been a 
selfish player, who rarely helps his teammates defensively. Karic, 28, leads 
the Sockers in both penalty minutes (21) and shots-attempted (179). 
</P>
<P>
Wright, who played sparingly last season but has 15 goals and 11 assists in 37 
games this season, is just 20 years old, and is widely regarded around the 
Major Indoor Soccer League as a future star because of his blinding speed. 
Wright, who has a large following in San Diego where he played for Grossmont 
High School, is a versatile player, who has 20 defensive blocks. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're getting something we don't have from Paul," midfielder Brian 
Quinn said. "But we're giving up a player in Zoran that's done well the last 
two years. I think Ron (Newman) and Zoran's personalties clashed. I don't think 
anyone questions Zoran's ability." 
</P>
<P>
The trade will allow the Sockers some breathing room with the $875,000 MISL 
salary cap, which Fowler said the Sockers have pushed to the limit. According 
to sources, Karic makes around $50,000, Wright around $30,000.

OLAJUWON TOO MUCH FOR SPURS, ROBINSON IN ROCKET WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a match of the two best centers in the Western Conference, Akeem Olajuwon 
outperformed David Robinson and led the Houston Rockets to a 109-105 victory 
over the San Antonio Spurs Monday night at San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
Olajuwon scored 14 of his 37 points in the fourth quarter, including a 15-foot 
jump shot with 39 seconds left that broke a 105-105 tie. 
</P>
<P>
He also had 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell Wiggins added two free throws with 11 seconds left to give the Rockets 
their sixth victory in 30 road games. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson scored 29 points for the Spurs, who had won four of their last six 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Miami 105, Utah 104 -- Glen Rice scored from the top of the key at the buzzer 
at Miami as the Heat ended the Jazz's seven-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Rice's shot came on a pass from Sherman Douglas, who rebounded a missed shot by 
teammate Scott Haffner. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the Heat's third in six games after winning just three of its 
previous 30. 
</P>
<P>
Rony Seikaly scored 25 points for the Heat and Douglas added 22 points and 14 
assists.

New Jersey 128, Sacramento 111 -- Chris Morris scored 22 points at East 
Rutherford, N.J., to lead the Nets, who had their best offensive performance of 
the season and won for only the third time in 21 games. 
</P>
<P>
Seven players scored in double figures for the Nets, whose previous high was 
117 points. Sam Bowie and Purvis Short each scored 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State 138, Charlotte 117 -- Mitch Richmond scored 30 points at Oakland

MORNING BRIEFING: STRIKING IT RICH IN LOTTERY IS LIKE STRIKING OUT DIMAGGIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARLEY TINKHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember Mickey McDermott, fun-loving left-hander for the Boston Red Sox in the 
1950s? He's suddenly a rich man. At least his wife is. 
</P>
<P>
Betty McDermott won close to $6 million in the Arizona lottery last month. She 
and her husband will receive $220,000 in post-tax earnings for the next 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey told the Boston Globe, "It's the luck of the Irish. I feel like I just 
fanned DiMaggio in the ninth inning with the bases loaded." 
</P>
<P>
Add McDermott: He was a free-spender as a player when he haunted the piano 
bars, but his wife said, "I get the checks, and I've got him on an allowance." 
</P>
<P>
Mickey said, "That's right. She gave me a $5 bill and a white shirt, and she 
told me not to change either one of them." 
</P>
<P>
More McDermott: He batted over .300 three times with the Red Sox, and he said 
he heard that Ted Williams and Dominic DiMaggio once went to owner Tom Yawkey 
and said, "Look, if you take the kid and put him at first or in the outfield, 
you'll have him for 20 years. If you leave him on the mound, the other three 
days he'll be in a nightclub somewhere, singing." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Who was Joe DiMaggio's first wife? 
</P>
<P>
It Had-to-Happen Dept: As Greg Norman addressed a chip on the first playoff 
hole at Doral, CBS analyst Ken Venturi said, "I would take the flagstick out." 
Norman left it in and sank the shot. Tim Simpson, next up, took the flagstick 
out and rolled the ball over the cup. 
</P>
<P>
Now-It-Can-Be-Told Dept.: Kevin Johnson, who played in his first NBA All-Star 
game this year, was asked if he asked Phoenix teammate Tom Chambers, a former 
All-Star MVP, for any advice before the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Johnson said. "Tom just told me to get him the ball as much as I can." 
</P>
<P>
In a nutshell: Trainer Wayne Lukas tells about a cross-country flight he took 
with weight-conscious jockey Laffit Pincay: "Leaving California, Pincay ate one 
half of an unsalted peanut. When we arrived in New York five hours later, he 
ate the other half." 
</P>
<P>
Scoring big: Said former King Bernie Nicholls after scoring his first goal for 
the New York Rangers: "I've had high tea at the Waldorf. I've had dinner at the 
Tavern on the Green. I've scored at the Garden. All I need now is a limo to 
take me around town and I'll be all right." 
</P>
<P>
Now-You-Know Dept.: From the Chicago Sun-Times: "The bar in Harry Caray's 
restaurant is 60 feet 6 inches, the distance from home plate to the pitcher's 
mound." 
</P>
<P>
Careful: Charley Walters of the St. Paul Pioneer Dispatch said that one major 
league executive, a critic of the owners' stand in negotiations, was overheard 
saying, "To call the owners dumb is an insult to dumb people." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Dorothy Arnold, a New York actress. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Dick Motta, coach of the Sacramento Kings, on team harmony: "I don't 
like a guy to talk back to me, but I'd rather have a guy who's mad at me when I 
pull him than if he's going to be a (wimp) all of his life." HARLEY TINKHAM

SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 96 points last week and gave 
back only 10 points Monday, there was no stampede to buy San Diego stocks, said 
Irving Katz, director of research at Thomas Green/San Diego Securities. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the San Diego County issues, only three managed gains of more than one 
point. 
</P>
<P>
Molecular Biosystems as up $2.25, Cubic Corp. gained $2 and Maxwell 
Laboratories gained $1. 
</P>
<P>
Great American Bank rode a roller coaster last week, moving up to $5.75 on the 
announcement that Ed Wedbush had filed to possibly increase his 17% position 
and take a more active management stance. However, the subsequent announcements 
that the S&amp;L's auditors were coming back to reassess the final quarter 
write-downs on Arizona loans caused the stock to drop as low as $3.50 on 
trading of over 1 million shares on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Great American stock was also pushed down by an apparently erroneous article in 
Friday's Wall Street Journal that stated Great American's capitalization plan 
had been rejected by the Office of Thrift Supervision. Both Great American and 
the OTS denied the report. 
</P>
<P>
Great American's announcement on Monday that it was hiring an investment 
banking firm, possibly to help it raise capital, caused the stock to bounce 
back $.50 on Monday to $4.25. 
</P>
<P>
Intermark Inc. and Triton Group Ltd. finally announced that the two companies 
would merge with 1.4 shares of Intermark being exchanged for each share of 
Triton Group. As this was reflected in their market prices with no apparent 
premium, the stocks adjusted only fractionally. 
</P>
<P>
Kaypro, which finally filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, saw its stock drop to 
the lowest possible quotation of 1/32 and closed the week at 1/16. The stock 
has been depressed since its continuing announcements of losses and management 
changes.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: DATAPRODUCTS SELF-TENDER ATTRACTS TOO MANY SHARES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dataproducts Corp. said its self-tender offer of $10 a share for 4 million 
shares, or 20%, of its stock was oversubscribed. 
</P>
<P>
The Woodland Hills-based maker of computer printers said about 17.8 million 
shares were tendered to the company. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Dataproducts will buy about 22% of the shares that were tendered 
by each stockholder. 
</P>
<P>
Dataproducts launched the offer as part of a major restructuring that included 
the sale of its headquarters property. The $40 million in net proceeds from 
that sale are being used to pay for the self-tender offer. After the stock is 
purchased, Dataproducts will have 15.8 million total common shares outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the buyback, Dataproducts' remaining stock fell sharply Monday. The 
stock closed at $4.875, down $1, in American Stock Exchange composite trading.

JACK SMITH: DEMOLISHING DECONSTRUCTION BRINGS MORE DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I continue to be chastised for questioning the validity and value of a vogue 
form of literary criticism known as deconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
I do not understand deconstruction, as I admitted; but I infer, from what I 
have read, that it reduces texts to ambiguity or meaninglessness. In the end, 
the word is master of the man. 
</P>
<P>
It was born in France, but now seems to be entrenched in American higher 
education, especially at UC Irvine and Occidental College. 
</P>
<P>
I have already quoted John Rowe, of the Critical Theory Institute at Irvine, 
who complained that as a journalist I am no more able to understand 
deconstruction than to understand atomic physics or perform laser surgery. 
Quite correct. 
</P>
<P>
Similar complaints, though more acerbic, have come from Michael R. Near, 
assistant professor of English, and Daniel D. Fineman, associate professor of 
English and comparative literary studies, both of Occidental. 
</P>
<P>
Having had my say, I owe my critics a hearing. I hope my necessarily brief 
summaries reflect fairly the tone and content of their protests. 
</P>
<P>
Near's is long and detailed. First, he says that my ignorance makes it hard to 
take me seriously. But he notes that I would not scorn an astrophysicist 
because he could not explain his work to me in a few simple words. "I am 
therefore curious that you would feel no compunction about leveling your scorn 
at language specialists who could not reduce to a few simple terms the 
intricacies of deconstruction." 
</P>
<P>
He said my column was "childish, intellectually irresponsible, and 
ideologically dangerous," and perpetuated "the long anti-intellectual tradition 
that values the obvious and eschews the difficult enterprise of critical 
thinking. . . . And you do it in such an engaging style that we can barely 
detect the ideological rot that serves as the foundation for your discussion. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
(That's not as bad as comparing me to Hitler and Stalin, as another critic 
did.) 
</P>
<P>
Prof. Fineman, like Near and Rowe, said that I simply do not have the education 
to understand deconstruction. He notes that he has spent 15 years trying to 
read Jacques Derrida, its high priest. "His work is very difficult because it 
relies on an in-depth knowledge of Western philosophy from Parmenides to 
Husserl, a set of theoretical gambits that are at odds with those implicit in 
this same Western culture, a use of language that is intentionally metaphoric, 
and no desire to lower his rhetorical or discursive 'level' to please an 
audience which has not done its 'homework.' " 
</P>
<P>
As if that were not enough to shut me out, he notes that deconstruction can be 
thought of as "a humanistic replication of Kurt Godel's Incompleteness Theorem 
of 1931." (I admit I am not familiar with that theorem.) 
</P>
<P>
"Now Godel was one of the great mathematicians of the 20th Century, and his 
work in foundations and meta-mathematics is universally respected by those who 
can understand it. Nonetheless, I suspect that if you 'knock at (his) door,' 
you will also find no one who speaks your particularly impoverished version of 
English." 
</P>
<P>
I admit my ignorance. I am even more ignorant than the person who wrote the 
following plaintive letter, asking to remain anonymous: 
</P>
<P>
"Your essay was a shot in the arm. I am a candidate for an M.A. in English. For 
several years now, I have been struggling to understand deconstruction. As of 
today, I still haven't a clue as to what it is about. I have been made to feel 
inadequate by certain . . . professors because I wasn't able to gush over this 
new phenomenon or use its jargon. . . . I am a humble high school English 
teacher. The flatulent, self-conscious and pompous deconstruction essays are 
the very antithesis of what I have been teaching my students about writing. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
And this one, also anonymous, from a graduate student in the humanities at UCI, 
where Derrida is in residence: 
</P>
<P>
"As a rule, the faculty worships the ground (Derrida) walks on. Your article . 
. . only expresses the tip of the iceberg. The real tragedy is the salaries, 
perks, grad student favors, secretarial help and free conference time that 
these tenured 'researchers' receive while 27 million Americans are illiterate. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
Have the deconstructionists improved the writing of one novelist or poet, or 
made literature any more readable? Does anyone outside the rarefied air of 
their ivory towers have the slightest idea what they're talking about? 
</P>
<P>
True, I don't understand the physicists either, but at least they gave us the 
atom bomb.

Just Joshing: When George Bush gives a speech, he sometimes warms up his 
audience with news-oriented humor. At a recent New York fund-raiser for 
congressional candidate Susan Molinari, he said: "Here I am in the middle of 
the battle right here in New York, where one of the great contests of 1990 will 
take place. A lot is at stake -- there's been a lot of money spent on both 
sides, a lot of press attention." He paused, then quipped. "But I'm not here to 
talk about the Trumps."

No Contest: Gretchen Polhemus, Miss USA 1989, has some advice for her newly 
crowned successor: "I told her to get an attorney. There's a lot of things in 
that contract that are unclear." Polhemus told the Wichita., Kan., Eagle in an 
interview published Sunday that she was required to work 12-hour days and 
hadn't received all her prizes. The new Miss USA, Carole Gist, 20, of Detroit, 
was crowned Friday in Wichita. Pageant spokeswoman Sara Meza said officials 
renegotiated Polhemus' contract to give her more days off after she complained.

<P>
Keeping Distance: Democratic candidates are not beating down Gov. Michael S. 
Dukakis' door for his endorsement this year. Even Dukakis has joked that the 
best favor he could do for one Democratic candidate for treasurer, House 
Speaker George Keverian, would be to endorse the Republican opponent, Joe 
Malone. State Sen. Richard Kraus, candidate for treasurer, said of such an 
endorsement: "The negatives are so high right now." Former state Atty. Gen. 
Francis X. Bellotti, a leading Democratic candidate for governor, "does not 
really place any value on an endorsement at that level," said a spokesman. Rep. 
John Flood, who was an outspoken critic of the governor during the presidential 
campaign, said he would use a Dukakis endorsement against whoever received it. 
"Obviously, it would be used by the campaign as a negative," he said.

DR. NEIL SOLOMON: POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I read the column in which you said that even people who have never 
been in combat can have post-traumatic stress disorder. But does there have to 
have been a physical injury before a person can say that he has such a problem? 
And is there medicine to treat the condition, or is this something for which 
you need a psychiatrist? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Physical injury is not a prerequisite for a diagnosis of post-traumatic 
stress disorder. For example, a person who witnesses an automobile accident in 
which a friend or relative is killed may develop the disorder. 
</P>
<P>
Some antidepressants may be beneficial for some patients, and anti-anxiety 
therapy may be helpful for others. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

 Neil Solomon is author of "Sick &amp; Tired of Being Sick &amp; Tired,"

O'BRIEN REPLACES 'JAKE'S' DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ron Link is out, Jack O'Brien is in as director of "Jake's Women," Neil Simon's 
latest comedy, which opens Thursday at the Old Globe Theatre and is scheduled 
to open at the end of next month in Broadway's Neil Simon Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not a meeting of the minds artistically," said producer Emanuel 
Azenberg of Link's dismissal. He declined to be more specific about the reason 
for the switch, which happened Friday, but he said "there was no ranting and 
raving. It was done very maturely." 
</P>
<P>
He discouraged speculation that the show, which went into previews last 
Wednesday, is in trouble. "The play is fine. It's not like 'Oh, my God, it's a 
disaster.' " 
</P>
<P>
Reached at his hotel, Simon said only that "I'm in the middle of rewrites. I 
can't talk." 
</P>
<P>
Link said that Azenberg blamed "chemistry" for the switch when he delivered the 
news. "I don't know what that means. I'm not really that sure what happened," 
he added. "All of Neil's people said that his shows have never been in better 
condition than this one was." Link had not talked to Simon since Friday, but he 
said that "Jack has promised me to shepherd my play to its opening." 
</P>
<P>
"Neil and Ron just had different views of the direction the play was going," 
said Thomas Hall, the Old Globe's managing director. "And it's the playwright's 
interests that need to be served." Asked if the Old Globe management concurred 
in the decision, he replied, "It was a consensus of opinion." 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien, artistic director of the Old Globe, must balance his new assignment 
with his direction of a television adaptation of Ibsen's "An Enemy of the 
People" for KCET in Los Angeles. It goes into rehearsal today, said a KCET 
spokesman, and will shoot for 11 days beginning March 19. It's scheduled to be 
broadcast in May. 
</P>
<P>
This marks a turnabout for the Simon/O'Brien relationship. In 1980, Simon fired 
O'Brien as director of the Los Angeles production of Simon's "I Ought to Be in 
Pictures." As recently as two months ago, O'Brien commented, "I believe in my 
heart right now that Neil loves me as a colleague but doesn't think I can play 
his music. As a director, I believe I can direct anything. To be successful, 
you've got to have enough chutzpah to say, 'I can do anything.' " 
</P>
<P>
Link could take some consolation in the fact, announced today, that he won a 
Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle award for his direction of "Stand-Up Tragedy" 
at the Mark Taper Forum last year.

A CIRCUS THAT MAKES THE OTHERS LOOK LIKE PEANUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE POLLACK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ST. LOUIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Circus, like ballet, speaks a universal language, and the Soviets, who wrote 
the book on ballet, may have done the same with the circus. 
</P>
<P>
The Moscow Circus, visiting here in its last stop before San Diego (Wednesday 
through Sunday at the Sports Arena), offers a display of talent so dazzling as 
to run through the superlatives before intermission, leaving the second act for 
mere "oohs" and "aahs" of appreciation and astonishment. 
</P>
<P>
Circus is an old and honorable tradition in the Soviet Union. The Leningrad 
Circus Building, where the Muscovites rehearse, dates to 1877, commissioned by 
an Italian circus master named Gaitano Cenzelli and designed to be so flexible 
it can be used today. 
</P>
<P>
This version of the Moscow Circus, with eight new acts since the group's first 
U.S. tour -- especially the aerialists and the jugglers -- made practically 
every other circus I've ever seen look minor league, and was even good enough 
to make me join enthusiastically in a standing ovation, an extremely rare 
tribute where I am concerned. 
</P>
<P>
They're that good. 
</P>
<P>
The performers were enthusiastic, and so was the audience of more than 6,000, 
which stood through two national anthems with outstanding patience, then rose 
to its feet again and roared excitedly through the finale as Caucasian horsemen 
sped around the ring displaying the flag of each nation. 
</P>
<P>
In between, children were bewitched by a pair of nifty clowns, grown-ups 
goggled at the skill and coordination of jugglers and everyone simply flipped 
out over the Hertz group, which showed off trapeze work never seen here before. 
</P>
<P>
The Hertzes set the two standard swings farther apart than usual. Between them, 
and much higher, just below the auditorium ceiling, was a fixed platform. The 
swingers and catchers, taking longer and higher (and therefore faster) swings 
than usual, caught and threw men and women between themselves and, even more 
spectacularly, threw them upward, in a series of flips, to the fixed platform. 
</P>
<P>
The gold-clad troupe flew in a series of intricate, breath-catching, 
gravity-defying flights using both swings and the platform. 
</P>
<P>
As a diversion, one young woman kept four hula hoops (yes, hula hoops!) in 
action at the same time while she hung by one hand from the platform. 
</P>
<P>
And as a climactic moment, a Hertz, soaring the fullest extent of the swing's 
arc, took off on a 22-meter flight the length of the net. 
</P>
<P>
The Gibadulin jugglers demonstrated hands so quick and sure they could give 
major league catchers, goalies and wide receivers some tips. The five-person 
group flings Indian clubs with enough speed to make them look blurry, and they 
work standing up, lying down, on each other's shoulders and in varying other 
combinations. 
</P>
<P>
But the Indian club work takes a back seat to a plate trick where one of the 
Gibadulins stands at one side of the ring and the other four at the other. Then 
the four start spinning plates toward the one, practically as fast as they can. 
The catcher snared all 16, using his right hand to catch and simultaneously 
shift them to his left. He caught the last two while lying on his back. 
</P>
<P>
As an encore, he rises and throws them back, first four from one hand to four 
receivers, then five, then six plates soaring in as many different directions 
from one simple slip. 
</P>
<P>
Valery Serebriakov and Yakov Popov are clowns, and their routines are similar 
to those used by clowns through the generations. They're better than most, 
however, and they have the same marvelous affinity with children that every 
clown seems to have, no matter his native tongue or country of origin. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander Frish and Albert Makhtsier share the ringmaster duties, and Frish 
joins the clowns, and the children in the audience, for some juggling tricks. 
</P>
<P>
Other high spots were Sarwat Begbudi, who works with the tigers, among other 
duties, and the Doveykos, who do acrobatics off a teeterboard with an uncommon 
degree of skill and daring. 
</P>
<P>
Begbudi handles a cage full of tigers in good style. More impressive is 
watching him juggle, which he does while standing atop the back of a trotting 
horse. Not for amateurs. 
</P>
<P>
The Doveykos have taken their routines one step farther, just as the Hertzes 
have. The Doveykos' ultimate trick involves an acrobat on a 10-foot stilt. He 
hops into position on the teeterboard, and when two teammates leap to the other 
end, he flies into the air, does two back flips and lands, without falling, on 
the single stilt. 
</P>
<P>
The Moscow Circus is more than circus; it is a display of incredible athletes 
at work, and it is an absolutely dazzling evening of entertainment.

It was a hot opening weekend for the Cold War thriller, "The Hunt for Red 
October." Paramount Pictures' adaptation of Tom Clancy's best-seller had ticket 
sales of $17.1 million -- for one of the biggest openings in a year, and one of 
the highest per-screen averages ($14,010) for a release of its size (1,225 
theaters) in box-office history. 
</P>
<P>
The spectacular performance put to rest industry speculation that the 
$35-million-plus film would be imperiled by its pre-glasnost scenario. 
</P>
<P>
Starring Sean Connery as a renegade Soviet submarine commander, "Red October" 
was originally slated for release in the fall. According to Barry London, 
president of Paramount's motion picture group, the decision to have the picture 
surface earlier was based on marketing strategies that took advantage of what 
had been an uneventful film year. 
</P>
<P>
"Red October" breaks out on Friday to 1,600 theaters.

What Ortega Speech?: Technical problems were cited Monday as the reason that 
many Los Angeles viewers were not able to see a speech by Nicaraguan President 
Daniel Ortega that was supposed to be broadcast Saturday on the community 
access channels of local cable systems. According to Bill Rosendahl, vice 
president of Century Cable in Santa Monica, there were problems in pulling the 
signal down from the satellite. The speech did air in most places as planned, 
however. BETH KLEID

MIDORI AT AMERICAN YOUTH SYMPHONY BENEFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The American Youth Symphony is 25 years old this season, or six years older 
than Midori, soloist for the acclaimed and accomplished training orchestra on 
its annual benefit concert at the Music Center. If adjectives were not a 
renewable resource, the young Japanese violinist would already have exhausted 
the stock of critical superlatives. 
</P>
<P>
For the first two movements of the Sibelius Concerto, Sunday evening at the 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Midori provided yet another demonstration of 
sovereign technique, on behalf of a mature, richly dramatic interpretation. Her 
sound is a variable wonder, always right for the passage, and her complete 
control of the notes allows her to focus the music as she wishes, not as she 
must. 
</P>
<P>
Her quest for expressive contrast, however, began to exaggerate Sibelius' 
vehement rhetoric in the third movement. Neither fiddling fire nor soulful song 
were ever lacking, but the bravura became increasingly brusque and the 
sentiment increasingly schmaltzy. Then near the end she slipped apart from the 
accompaniment, creating a finale that limped when it should have leaped. 
</P>
<P>
Conductor Mehli Mehta and the orchestra did their estimable best for Sibelius 
and Midori in accompaniment. Their work was vigorous and generally firmly 
pointed throughout. 
</P>
<P>
After intermission, Mehta turned to Sibelius' Second Symphony. He took a 
characteristically expansive approach to the familiar piece, respecting its 
formal idiosyncrasies while lavishing his attention on its emotional 
exigencies. 
</P>
<P>
His young musicians gave him clear and balanced playing, ringing with palpable 
enthusiasm for the music. Mehta shaped it knowingly, holding enough in reserve 
to make the finale an orgy of radiant sound, lit by brilliant brass work. 
</P>
<P>
Mehta began this program of Sibelius' greatest hits with "The Swan of Tuonela." 
Marilyn Schram played the dark, enigmatic English horn ecstasies with warm 
sound and pliant nuance. Brent Samuel shadowed her ardently in the cello solos, 
while Mehta underlined the most lugubrious aspects of the score.JOHN HENKEN

KILBEY TAKES ON T. REX IN SOLO ACOUSTIC SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I hate to see something like that beat me," said the Church's lead singer and 
songwriter Steve Kilbey, just before he gave up trying to remember the start of 
an old T. Rex song during his solo acoustic performance on Sunday at Club 
Lingerie. It was just one of many little gaffes (forgotten words and chords, 
etc.) in the 80-minute set, but it was just the perfect sort of thing for an 
easygoing evening in the club's new, relaxed Sunday acoustic format (tables on 
the dance floor and everything!). 
</P>
<P>
Kilbey pretty much played whatever he or the audience wanted -- he managed that 
T. Rex song later and did two others as well -- and to heck with the 
formalities. Throughout, the puckish Aussie was charming and disarming, in 
contrast to his band-mate Marty Willson-Piper, who was often pensive and 
melancholy in his recent solo show at Bogart's Bohemian Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
Not that Kilbey doesn't offer his share of melancholy. As a songwriter, it's 
his stock-in-trade. But there's a gauzy wistfulness to his style and voice that 
translated quite well to the acoustic context, where he drew on the Church 
repertoire and selections from his solo albums, as well as the T. Rex numbers 
and a gorgeously sad version of Lou Reed's "Caroline Says."STEVE HOCHMAN

REGGAE'S PIONEER POET HAS PICKED UP HIS PEN AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: LINTON KWESI JOHNSON TOOK A BREAK BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID HE'D RUN OUT OF 
THINGS TO SAY, BUT EUROPE THOUGHT OTHERWISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's a simple reason why Linton Kwesi Johnson's appearances this week will 
be his first Southern California performances in five years. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, the British "dub poetry" pioneer whose politically charged poems set 
to fluid reggae arrangements were among reggae's most dynamic recordings 
between 1978 and 1984, was afraid he had run out of words. 
</P>
<P>
"I actually had put music aside for about four years," Johnson said during a 
phone interview from Vancouver. "I hadn't been writing; I stopped because I 
thought basically I had dried up." 
</P>
<P>
But the lack of fresh material after his last studio album, 1984's "Making 
History," hadn't lessened European appetites for Johnson's live performances. 
The demand was so great that the poet joined forces with his regular 
collaborator, bassist-producer Dennis Bovell, for a 1988 tour celebrating 
Johnson's 10-year career. Bovell and the Dub Band are also backing Johnson on 
the current tour, which includes a date tonight at the Belly Up Tavern in 
Solana Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson wasn't inactive during his dry spell, serving as arts editor for the 
now-defunct Race Today magazine and doing journalistic work for British 
television and BBC radio. But that return to concert activity had an unexpected 
benefit: It got Johnson back in the writing groove, and now he plans to record 
a new album this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"When I mentioned to a fellow poet from the Caribbean that I had started 
writing again, he said, 'Nonsense, you must have been writing in your head,' " 
Johnson recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"Which basically was true -- I had been thinking about ideas for poems, putting 
things down on paper, but never really completed anything and . . . well, the 
muse has come back to me, let's put it that way. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I just had too many distractions, because poetry needs time for 
meditations. I was running here and there, traveling around doing reports on 
television. There was absolutely no time to sit down and apply my thoughts and 
ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 37, was reared in rural Jamaica and migrated to London in 1962 to join 
his mother. He earned a degree in sociology and began writing poetry after 
forming a writers workshop during his involvement with the Youth League of the 
British Black Panther Party in the early '70s. 
</P>
<P>
He first experimented with blending his words with music with the Rasta Love 
percussion group in 1972. While working for Virgin Records later in the decade, 
Johnson suggested the label finance a demo recording of his work. That led to 
the "Dread Beat An' Blood" album released under the name Poet &amp; the Roots 
in 1978. Four more albums for Island followed, and a live double album was 
released in America in 1986 by Shanachie. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's work influenced a number of later poets, including the late Michael 
Smith and Mutabaruka, and his charged analyses of social conditions in England 
opened a window on life in black Britain. 
</P>
<P>
In many respects, his albums were analogous to Gil Scott-Heron's politicized, 
poetic commentaries on the American scene during the '70s, and can be seen as a 
British reggae bridge to the black consciousness being forcefully expressed by 
rap artists today. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say I'm a big fan of any of these rapping artists, but I can identify 
with some of the sentiments that they're expressing," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think none of them have come near to Grandmaster Flash's 'The Message.' I'm 
encouraged by the fact that, even in some of the dance hall things in Jamaican 
reggae, there's this movement back to social consciousness and social issues." 
</P>
<P>
While he's less involved in the music world as a whole, Johnson does keep tabs 
on the reggae world. And he likes what he sees. 
</P>
<P>
"The reggae scene is quite healthy and vibrant," he said. "Just before 
Christmas, the Dub Band and I went to do a gig for Solidarity in Poland, and 
they're into reggae in a big way. 
</P>
<P>
"There were thousands of young Polish kids wearing (the Jamaican colors) red, 
gold and green, and they have their hair in dreadlocks. Reggae is now a world 
music."

OLSON IN STONESY SETTING WITH EX-STONE, SIDE STONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Local rocker Carla Olson, erstwhile leader of the Textones, has traveled her 
share of musical courses but always seemed at her best in a hard-rocking, 
Stonesy setting. And what better way to showcase those tendencies than to 
finally hire on a couple of actual Rolling Stones? 
</P>
<P>
Well, an ex-Stone and a side-Stone, to be precise -- guitarist Mick Taylor and 
keyboard player Ian McLagan, respectively, both part of the crack new band 
Olson showed off in two shows Sunday at the Roxy that were recorded for a 
planned live album. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine the Stones in their very bluesiest, early '70s mode, complete with 
plenty of cigarette smoke swirling up from around the guitar necks, but led by 
a really nice gal. To make the illusion complete, Olson did sing a few vintage 
numbers from the "Sticky Fingers" and "Goats Head Soup" era, and Taylor himself 
chimed in with a couple of lead vocals to go along with his slide work. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the material, though, was Olson's, either from the Textones' 
"Midnight Mission" album of six years back or newer material from a recent solo 
album released only in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
For Olson fans, these shows were clearly a relief after a considerably 
disappointing second Textones album three years ago and a subsequent duet album 
with Gene Clark that found her in a less appropriate folkie mold. Welcome back. 
</P>
<P>
For Taylor fans, this was an all-too-rare chance to check out the legend of The 
Guy Who Quit the Stones and Even Jagger Doesn't Know Why in a worthy context -- 
at home in exile on the Sunset Strip, if you will. CHRIS WILLMAN

with the government, may be overlooked in the U.S. census. The Census Bureau 
acknowledged that it has not been able to survey minority areas as effectively 
as white, English-speaking communities. However, it pointed to several new 
initiatives to reach out to recent immigrants.

MEDICAL ASSN. REFUSES TO OPPOSE SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Leaders of the California Medical Assn., lending their voice to the debate over 
efforts to eradicate the Mediterranean fruit fly, on Monday rejected 
overwhelmingly a resolution calling for a moratorium on malathion spraying 
until the pesticide's health effects can be studied further. 
</P>
<P>
The vote came at the CMA's annual House of Delegates meeting in Anaheim. While 
it was interpreted by some association leaders as a declaration that malathion 
spraying is safe, proponents of the resolution said it failed because of 
political, rather than medical, considerations. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no demonstrable danger from spraying of malathion," said Charles M. 
Hair, past president of the association. "We accept the fact that our 
agriculture is severely threatened and this does not propose a danger to our 
patients." 
</P>
<P>
Added Dr. Mitchell S. Karlan, a member of the CMA's scientific board: "We are 
taking a step that to our knowledge, malathion is safe." 
</P>
<P>
But Dr. H. Rex Greene, a Pasadena oncologist who in three days of committee 
meetings led opposition to spraying, disagreed that the vote meant the 
association had endorsed the safety of spraying malathion over infested 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"I think CMA really doesn't want to take a position," he said. "We're not 
saying malathion is safe. We're not saying malathion is unsafe. We're afraid of 
stirring up the public and causing undue fears." 
</P>
<P>
Greene noted that most of the members of the 353-member House of Delegates are 
from agricultural areas not being sprayed. 
</P>
<P>
He contended that studies so far do not prove malathion safe. "I tell my 
patients I don't know, but I hope they don't have any children in the next five 
years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Declaring that current studies of the chronic effects of malathion are 
"deficient scientifically and must be repeated," the resolution had asked for 
an immediate halt to aerial spraying. An amendment to the resolution, which 
also failed, had asked that CMA's Scientific Board review the safety of 
malathion spraying. It was rejected by an overwhelming voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. L. Rex Ehling, Orange County's health director and a CMA representative for 
California Family Physicians, said a 1980 study of spraying in Santa Clara 
County found "no significant health risk." 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a bipartisan group of 36 state Assembly members on 
Monday jointly voiced their support for the spraying, which since an 
infestation was discovered in August has become a biweekly ritual for vast 
sectors of Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers, who represent primarily rural districts and who are seeking to 
maintain legislative support for the use of malathion, stated that spraying is 
safe and insisted that the campaign to control the Medfly should continue, 
despite the hardship for Southern Californians. 
</P>
<P>
The legislators predicted a wide range of devastating effects if aerial 
spraying is halted, including severe economic losses for growers. They 
maintained that if the Medfly made its way into agricultural fields, the result 
would be more farm use of pesticides, higher food costs, threats to worker 
safety, embargoes and loss of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"As Californians, we are all in this together," the legislators said in a joint 
statement. "Malathion bait spraying is not for the benefit of California 
farmers at the expense of Southern Californians, but must be continued for the 
environment, public health, and economic good of the entire state." 
</P>
<P>
The pro-malathion contingent emerged on the eve of a session before the full 
Assembly to take testimony from Deukmejian Administration officials and 
scientific experts on the use of malathion. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the state's farm regions are concerned that urban 
legislators are gearing up to block the spraying program. 
</P>
<P>
In at least three Southern California cities, concerns about malathion have 
prompted city governments to attempt to ban low-flying helicopters over their 
borders. 
</P>
<P>
This novel attempt to keep out the Medfly eradicators has proven to be largely 
symbolic, and on Monday the Federal Aviation Administration issued a general 
but pointed reminder that it was responsible for policing aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
FAA Regional Administrator Jerry Chavkin issued a statement saying that 
Congress has passed laws, which have been upheld by the courts, limiting to the 
federal government the power to control the flight of aircraft, including 
helicopters engaged in aerial spraying to eradicate the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
Chavkin said he hoped "reason would prevail over emotional responses if the 
airborne dissemination of malathion is resumed." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Chavkin's warning, the Azusa City Council was contemplating both a 
legal and aerial challenge to the renewed spraying in the East San Gabriel 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The city planned to rent a helicopter from Pasadena, which earlier had tried to 
shadow and cite a state squadron of malathion-spraying copters, and do the same 
thing by sending an Azusa police officer aloft. Azusa is among nearly a dozen 
communities in Los Angeles and Orange counties that has opposed aerial spraying 
either by passing ordinances or threatening to file lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Spraying was to resume Monday night in Azusa, Irwindale, Glendora and the 
Brea-La Habra Heights area, but the operation was canceled because of strong 
winds.

STUDENTS' MARCH TURNS INTO FIGHTS, VANDALISM; 
</P>
<P>
DEMONSTRATION: ABOUT 2,000 FROM TWO SOUTH BAY HIGH SCHOOLS WERE PROTESTING 
ALLEGED RACISM IN THE RESIGNATION OF A BLACK PRINCIPAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A demonstration Monday morning by about 2,000 students from two South Bay area 
high schools protesting alleged racism turned violent as demonstrators began 
fighting and vandalizing property, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Five students were detained for questioning and at least two people sustained 
minor injuries in "scattered fights" that erupted after students from Leuzinger 
High School converged on the Hawthorne High School campus to protest the 
resignation of that school's black principal, Ken Crowe, police and school 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Monday, Crowe said that he announced his plans to step down on 
Feb. 28 because the Centinela Valley Union High School District Board of 
Trustees had informed him he would be reassigned to another, unnamed position 
at the end of the year. He has also accused the board of failing to support his 
attempts to rid Hawthorne High of racial harassment. 
</P>
<P>
Although board members have said they support Crowe's efforts, students believe 
he was being forced out by racism. 
</P>
<P>
"We went there peacefully to try to stop the racism," said Monica Fritsch, a 
16-year-old Leuzinger student. "Then the gangs started fighting. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We know the schools are cross-town rivals, but we were trying to forget about 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Chanting "fight the powers" and "hell, no, we won't go," several hundred 
students from Leuzinger in Lawndale streamed out of classes at about 10 a.m. 
and began marching to the Hawthorne campus, more than a mile away, where they 
joined with many students who left their classes. 
</P>
<P>
Not long after the demonstration began, a passer-by was shot and slightly 
wounded in the head with a pellet gun, and an unidentified Leuzinger student 
suffered a minor hand injury during a melee, Hawthorne Police Lt. Herb Mundon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The passer-by, Silvio Serrapica, 39, was hospitalized in good condition. The 
student was treated and released from the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Police said gang fights also broke out during the protest, which they said 
involved as many as 2,000 youths. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne Police Sgt. Brad Bristow said the two schools are rivals with a long 
history of gang tension. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had gang problems at those two schools for years," Bristow said. "When 
Leuzinger and Hawthorne play football, we always send an extra force in there." 
</P>
<P>
Despite what police said, most students and school officials maintained that 
gang rivalry was unrelated to the demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
"This has nothing to do with gangs," said Leuzinger Principal Sonja Davis. 
"Considering the number of kids we were dealing with, they were really 
well-behaved." 
</P>
<P>
One merchant along the march route complained that students had vandalized his 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Shin, owner of a convenience store at Hawthorne Boulevard and 137th Street, 
said more than 100 teen-agers stormed his store and plundered shelves. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'What's going on?' " Shin said. "But they just scattered. I didn't 
know what to do. They started grabbing things; knocking down displays." 
</P>
<P>
The protesters were met at the Hawthorne campus on El Segundo Boulevard by 
about 100 officers from Hawthorne and several nearby law enforcement 
jurisdictions. 
</P>
<P>
Officers, who set up roadblocks around the campus, herded most of the 
protesters to the school's football field and bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration ended at about noon when administrators and police officers 
persuaded students to go back to class. 
</P>
<P>
But even as the Leuzinger students began boarding buses brought in to take them 
back to school, police said, some Hawthorne students began throwing rocks at 
the vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
One of the detained five students was booked for investigation of felony 
charges after he allegedly hurled a grapefruit-size chunk of concrete at a bus, 
police said. The others were released to parents. 
</P>
<P>
Most students were back in class by 1:30 p.m. and resumed a regular schedule 
until the school day ended at 2:30 p.m., officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Students said the march was the result of nearly a week of planning. After 
Crowe's resignation, Hawthorne students began circulating flyers announcing a 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
However, many Leuzinger students said they did not find out about the protest 
until early Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"The security guards told us that we should walk out of class because (the 
school administration) just wanted Leuzinger to be all white," Monica Fritsch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
She said security guards told students that the district was planning to fire 
all minority personnel. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, students had planned two demonstrations, one at Leuzinger 
on Monday and another at Hawthorne for today. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said Leuzinger will hold assemblies this morning to give the students a 
chance to air their grievances. 
</P>
<P>
Crowe, who has been Hawthorne principal since February, 1988, said he does not 
want to leave the school and believes the move to reassign him is a "political 
payoff" for a white teacher who assisted in the election of three new trustees 
in November. 
</P>
<P>
Board members declined to comment Monday on Crowe's position in the district. 
</P>
<P>
One of the new board members, Pam Sturgeon, said she was upset about Monday's 
demonstration and would meet with fellow board members to decide what action 
they might take to cool tensions. 
</P>
<P>
Sturgeon said that she and another new board member, Jacqueline Carrera, have 
received threatening phone calls. She said someone called Carrera's mother and 
asked, ' "How would you like to see your daughter in a wheelchair?' " 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the district, which has about 6,000 students, has had a spate 
of race-related incidents, which some administrators attribute to a handful of 
white teachers who, they say, are having difficulty working with minority 
administrators. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Andrea Ford, Shawn Hubler, Marc Lacey, George Hatch and 
Linda Chong contributed to this story. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The student march was tainted by minor fistfights and a looting incident. 
Police said gangmembers from the rival schools were involved in brawls and 
began hurling stones at school buses.In addition, the owner of a Hawthorne 
convenience store said about 100 teens stormed his store a1852055667

BRADLEY, OTHERS DO AN ABOUT-FACE IN WAVING ANTI-MALATHION BANNER; 
</P>
<P>
NEWS ANALYSIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ASHLEY DUNN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley joined the anti-malathion battle just two weeks 
ago -- later than many critics, but with a stand that undoubtedly pleased the 
growing movement against aerial spraying. 
</P>
<P>
"Malathion," the mayor proclaimed in a press release, "is a matter of great 
concern. I strongly feel the state must prove to us that the Medfly spraying is 
safe." 
</P>
<P>
Nine years ago, however, as a Medfly infestation spread throughout portions of 
Northern California, Bradley, then in the midst of his 1981 gubernatorial 
campaign, took a far different stand. Citing a "preponderance of opinion that 
there was no health hazard," Bradley declared he had "come down on the side of 
immediate spraying." 
</P>
<P>
Not content with lending only moral support to the cause, the mayor volunteered 
the use of city helicopters to spray pesticide over Southern California, which 
had a small Medfly outbreak at the same time as the 1980-82 Northern California 
infestation. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor is not alone in changing his mind. 
</P>
<P>
Legislators who once clamored for Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. to save the state's 
agriculture industry with immediate malathion spraying have become some of 
today's most vocal leaders in trying to stop the state's malathion assault on 
the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sepulveda), for example, voted for a resolution in 
1981 demanding immediate spraying to fend off the threatened Medfly disaster. 
This year, Katz authored his own resolution demanding just the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the politicians who switched positions said they did so because they 
have learned more with the passage of time or they believe the state should 
develop less intrusive ways of combating the fly -- such as increased use of 
sterile flies to breed the pests out of existence. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued through his press office last week, Bradley echoed the 
thoughts of others who have switched positions by explaining that much more is 
known today about the health effects of malathion. 
</P>
<P>
But over the last nine years, there have been few scientific breakthroughs to 
prove or disprove the pesticide's safety. In fact, today's heated debate over 
malathion's possible link to cancer or the efficiency of aerial spraying 
against the Medfly is lifted almost verbatim from the crisis nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Brown warned then, just as many officials have warned today, that even if there 
is only a sliver of doubt, the public health must come first in any decision 
concerning aerial spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most controversial figures of the time also have surfaced again 
this year, raising essentially the same arguments. For example, health 
officials Marc Lappe and Melvin Reuber stunned state officials in 1981 with 
their attacks against state and federal reports that gave the pesticide a clean 
bill of health. 
</P>
<P>
Both Lappe and Reuber have spoken out again this year, arousing the same 
controversy as before. 
</P>
<P>
So what has changed? 
</P>
<P>
After four straight years of malathion spraying in Southern California, public 
opinion has made a sharp turn, indicated by recent polls and the widespread 
outcry that had not developed during previous infestations in Southern 
California. The change in public opinion has not escaped notice in City Hall or 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Also, many of these politicians represent areas that were only minimally 
affected by earlier sprayings and are now finding themselves increasingly under 
fire by constituents whose homes have been sprayed repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
Gubernatorial politics also played a much larger role in the 1981 Medfly 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's outspoken support of spraying barely drew a complaint nine years ago. 
The major exception was his gubernatorial opponent, George Deukmejian, who 
battled mightily to outdo his opponent for the crucial farm vote. 
</P>
<P>
"You know George Deukmejian is not a fair-weather farmer," he said in a 1981 
campaign speech from heart of the farm-rich San Joaquin Valley. "You know I 
have been your friend for two decades. . . . And you know that when I give you 
my word I don't owe one single thing to the labor bosses and the environmental 
activists that surround Tom Bradley." 
</P>
<P>
This year, both Bradley and Deukmejian have kept a low profile on the spraying 
issue and have said little on the topic until recently, although Deukmejian has 
remained committed to the program. Gubernatorial candidates Republican Pete 
Wilson and Democrats Dianne Feinstein and John K. Van de Kamp have yet to 
embrace aerial spraying as a campaign issue, although Van de Kamp, as attorney 
general, has called for a study of whether malathion should be more heavily 
regulated. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of aerial spraying has been a tough one for legislators. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, 86 state legislators voted in favor of Assembly and Senate resolutions 
demanding that Brown start aerial spraying. Supporters of the resolutions 
included Katz, Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), Assemblyman Richard L. 
Mountjoy (R-Monrovia), all 14 Senate representatives from Los Angeles and 
Orange counties voting that day and 16 of 24 local Assembly members who cast 
votes on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti also voted in favor of a Senate bill that would have forced Brown to 
start aerial spraying. The measure was unanimously passed. 
</P>
<P>
In the current debate, Katz, Roberti and Mountjoy have taken visible roles in 
the battle to stop malathion spraying over Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Although many of the legislative seats have changed hands since the 1981 Medfly 
debate, already 21 of 55 Los Angeles and Orange County lawmakers have signed 
letters, supported resolutions or joined lawsuits against malathion spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Mountjoy and Katz signed a highly publicized protest letter against spraying 
that was sent to the governor last week. "The health of over a million 
Californians is just too important for you to continue this 'spray now, ask 
questions later' policy," the letter stated. 
</P>
<P>
Katz and Roberti also are party to a lawsuit filed against the state by the 
Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, aimed at stopping 
aerial pesticide spraying over urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti said in an interview last week that he supported spraying in 1981 
because he believed it was the only way at the time to eradicate the Medfly. He 
said he has changed his mind because the state has had nine years to develop 
alternative strategies, such as greater use of sterile flies, but has done 
little. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a proper vote," he said. "What was reasonable then is not reasonable 
now. At this point, the concerns about public health outweigh anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Katz was more apologetic for his earlier vote, saying that he was naive nine 
years ago and has learned to be more skeptical of state policies. 
</P>
<P>
"If we could all go back, we'd all do things differently," he said. "You hope 
you learn to do better next time. In 10 years, I've learned to ask more 
questions and not trust the experts." 
</P>
<P>
A few legislators have stood their ground, in particular, Sen. Art Torres 
(D-Los Angeles) and Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
Both legislators cast votes against malathion spraying in 1981 and have become 
two of the most vocal leaders in the current battle to stop spraying. 
</P>
<P>
The position adopted by Torres and Roos was not a popular one at the time. 
Newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times, editorialized in 1981 by decrying 
the hysteria over spraying in Northern California and blaming it on "some 
particularly rabid environmentalists, abetted by irresponsible or ill-informed 
local politicians." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, The Times applauded news of the formation of a state health advisory 
committee to review scientific studies on malathion.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN HELD IN THREATS TO STEPHANIE ZIMBALIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Michigan man has been arrested at a Sherman Oaks hotel after sending more 
than 200 threatening letters to actress Stephanie Zimbalist, daughter of Efrem 
Zimbalist Jr. and star of the television series Remington Steele, the FBI said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested for investigation of mailing threatening communications was Michael 
Lawrence Shields, 43, of Plymouth, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Sending such materials through the mail is a violation of federal extortion 
statutes punishable by up to five years in prison and a $1,000 fine, said 
special agent Lawrence G. Lawler. 
</P>
<P>
Shields was arrested about 6 p.m. Friday at the Valley Hilton Hotel in Sherman 
Oaks, where he was a registered guest. The FBI learned of his whereabouts, 
according to Lawler, after Shields revealed it in a letter to Zimbalist.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEW ENVIRONMENTAL CHIEF NAMED FOR PORT OF 
L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Port of Los Angeles has a new director of its environmental management 
division -- Donald Rice, who has been the port's second-ranking environmental 
officials for the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Rice replaces Lillian Kawasaki, who Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley appointed 
recently as manager of the city's new Environmental Affairs Department. 
</P>
<P>
Rice, 45, of Huntington Beach, joined the port in 1974 as a marine 
environmental assistant and became its assistant environmental management 
director in 1980. During that time, he participated in dozens of scuba dives 
aimed at gathering biological samples and planting kelp beds along the 
breakwater.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 5 SUSPECTS ARRESTED IN TORRANCE MURDER PLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Torrance police have arrested five suspects in the Friday morning stabbing 
death of a Torrance man, authorities said. Gary Jose Alderete, 21, of Torrance, 
had gotten into an argument earlier in the week with the victim, William Smith, 
39, who died of multiple stab wounds, said Police Lt. Harold Maestri. 
</P>
<P>
Alderete was arrested Friday by California Highway Patrol officers who saw him 
running along the freeway near the crime scene in the 3900 block of West 171st 
Street, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Maestri said four others were arrested Friday night and early Saturday and 
booked on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder and murder. They were: 
Michael Grace, 21, of Carson; his brother, Richard Grace, 23, of Gardena; Stacy 
James, 20, of Torrance, and Alexander Frederick, 22, of Gardena. They allegedly 
plotted Smith's murder and two drove Alderete to the victim's home that 
morning, police said. They were being held without bail.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DENNIS BROWN WILL NOT RUN FOR ASSEMBLY 
AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Declaring that the Lord "wants me to do something else with my life," 
Assemblyman Dennis Brown (R-Los Alamitos) on Monday announced he will not seek 
reelection. Brown, 40, a staunch conservative, was elected in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"I never intended to stay this long. Before I get too decrepit, I want to do 
something else," said Brown, whose negative votes on a variety of issues earned 
him the nickname "Dr. No." 
</P>
<P>
His decision is expected to touch off a scramble to succeed him in the heavily 
Republican 58th District, which includes parts of Long Beach and Signal Hill in 
Los Angeles County and Seal Beach and part of Huntington Beach in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
With Brown's dropping out, Friday's deadline to file election papers for the 
Assembly seat will be extended until March 14.

RACIAL TENSION BUILDING FOR MONTHS IN THE DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Monday's demonstration by students from two South Bay area high schools, which 
was sparked by the resignation of a popular black principal, culminated months 
of racial tension in a district that has seen dramatic ethnic changes in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne High Principal Ken Crowe announced last Wednesday that he would 
resign at the end of the year under pressure from the Centinela Valley Union 
High School District Board of Trustees, which decided last week to reassign 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Crowe said the five board members gave him no reason for their decision and 
have not told him where they want him to work. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Pam Sturgeon declined to comment on the matter and the other 
trustees -- Ruth Morales, Michael Escalante, Amparo Font and Jacqueline Carrera 
-- could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement by Crowe rekindled rumors among students at Hawthorne and 
Leuzinger highs and parents that the board intends to fire, or reassign, all 
minority administrators hired by Supt. McKinley Nash in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
In past interviews board members -- who include four Latinos and one white -- 
have steadfastly denied such rumors. 
</P>
<P>
Nash, who is black, became superintendent in the 1983-84 school year, when four 
of the district's 19 top-level administrative posts were held by minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Of the district's 20 top-level posts today, nine are held by minorities -- six 
by blacks, two by Latinos and one by an Asian-American. 
</P>
<P>
For months the district, which has about 6,000 students, has been plagued by a 
spate of race-related incidents, ranging from anonymous notes and offensive 
cartoons targeting minority administrators to the confiscation in October at 
Hawthorne High of a mannequin designed to look like a dead black man. 
</P>
<P>
In September, a white teachers union president referred to Nash in a meeting of 
Leuzinger and Hawthorne teachers as a "Stepin Fetchit" for state Supt. of 
Public Instruction Bill Honig. 
</P>
<P>
The union president, Nancy Neussler, said she meant no racial slight by the 
term, which refers to a black actor in the 1930s who fawned over his white 
bosses. She later apologized publicly. 
</P>
<P>
Nash asserts that the incidents stem from resistance to reform in his 
fast-changing district, which has seen its share of non-white students soar 
from 45% only 10 years ago to more than 80% today. 
</P>
<P>
The district's student body is 52.4% Latino, 18.7% white, 17.1% black, with the 
remaining 11.8% representing Asians, Pacific Islanders, Filipinos and American 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
However, some administrators and parents have suggested that a handful of white 
teachers who are having trouble working with minority administrators are behind 
the racial problems. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews, Crowe has said the trustees have failed to support his efforts 
to halt the racial harassment of administrators at his school. He also said a 
small group of white teachers who want to take control of his school's 
administration have pressured board members to remove him. 
</P>
<P>
Sturgeon, in past interviews, has said no such pressure regarding any minority 
administrator exists. 
</P>
<P>
At Sturgeon's recommendation, the board agreed last month to ask the state 
Department of Education to study the racial tensions in the district. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People says it has also begun 
an investigation.

SHERIFF FIGHTING ORDER ON GAS-RETRIEVAL SYSTEM AT JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is fighting an order by air-quality 
officials who want the department to install a retrieval system to siphon off 
methane gas rising from a landfill at the County Jail in Castaic. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District issued the department a notice 
of violation Jan. 24 because methane gas levels at the dump were four to six 
times above the state safety standard, AQMD spokesman David Rutherford said 
Monday. Despite the high readings, it is not clear whether a health risk 
exists, said Mohsen Nazemi, a supervising engineer with the AQMD. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD ordered the department to install a system of wells and flares that 
would collect and burn off the gas created by decomposing garbage. Such systems 
are standard requirements at landfills, Rutherford said. 
</P>
<P>
But Capt. Tom Hehir said the Sheriff's Department will ask an AQMD review board 
to grant a variance allowing the dump at the Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho to 
operate without the retrieval system. The department could submit its request 
as early as next week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hehir said the Sheriff's Department opposes the retrieval system because 
consultants retained by the department doubt there is enough methane to collect 
at the dump. Cost is a concern as well. The consultants estimate a 
gas-collection system could cost between $500,000 and $1 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hehir, recent studies found an average of only 9 parts per million 
of methane, well below the standard of 50 parts per million. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD's order was based on 1988 tests that found averages as high as 324 
parts per million of methane, Rutherford said. 
</P>
<P>
The low readings provided by the Sheriff's Department did not impress AQMD 
engineers. "We were not convinced" that a retrieval system is not needed, 
Rutherford said. 
</P>
<P>
The landfill, about 10 years old and located in a remote portion of the jail, 
covers 37 acres but could expand to 54 acres, Hehir said. It accepts 22 tons of 
refuse from the jail each day.

COST TO CLOSE SHIPYARD PUT AT $1.7 BILLION; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE BUDGET: A STUDY DONE FOR THE LONG BEACH CITY COUNCIL SAYS IT WOULD FAR 
EXCEED THE $8 MILLION A YEAR THE PENTAGON EXPECTS TO SAVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A study released Monday concludes that it would cost as much as $1.7 billion to 
close the Long Beach Naval Shipyard and make the land on which it sits useful 
again, far surpassing the $8 million a year that the Defense Department expects 
to save by shutting it down. 
</P>
<P>
"They are awesome figures," said City Councilman Les Robbins. "Given the 
respective mathematics, it doesn't seem to be a very good business proposition 
and that's what it's supposed to be -- good business." 
</P>
<P>
The study, commissioned by the Long Beach City Council, is said to be the first 
to assess what has been only previously guessed at -- the cost of boarding up a 
shipyard that has been a piece of the city's economic backbone since 1943. 
</P>
<P>
The shipyard is one of 100 military installations targeted by the Pentagon for 
possible closure or consolidation under a plan to reduce the defense budget in 
large part in response to political reforms in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
But according to the study conducted last week, it would cost the federal 
government as much as $1.7 billion to address the needs of the 4,100 laid-off 
civilian workers, demolish the dry docks, shops and piers, haul away the debris 
and repair soil that may have been contaminated by toxins and hazardous 
industrial materials. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers with Barfield Associates, an industrial cost-estimating service in 
Los Angeles, spent several hours at the shipyard last week and reviewed figures 
provided by the federal government to come up with the cost of the shutdown. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a massive undertaking, a mammoth undertaking," said Gerald Miller, 
manager of the city's Economic Development Bureau. "The cost of making that 
property usable again would be very, very high." 
</P>
<P>
The closure would mean an additional $495 million in lost contracts, supply 
sales and salaries spent in the Harbor area, bringing the total federal and 
local impact to approximately $2.1 billion, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
The effects would be felt beyond the Long Beach boundaries since only about 
one-third of the shipyard employees live in that city and cash their paychecks 
there, officials have said. The rest of the workers are scattered throughout 
Los Angeles and Orange counties, Miller said. Previous estimates from the local 
Chamber of Commerce put the anticipated damage to the local economy at only 
half that. 
</P>
<P>
"Strategically, it becomes a very stupid move," said Bill Gurzi, a member of 
the Southern California Save Our Shipyard Committee. "The numbers are 
staggering. A half-billion dollars is a major, major blow to the South Bay 
economy." 
</P>
<P>
The study by Barfield Associates was completed in 36 hours last week, in time 
for Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell and five city councilmen to take the results to 
Washington, where they are meeting with members of Congress to lobby for the 
shipyard's survival. 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials in Washington could not be reached for comment on the study. 
</P>
<P>
Since the so-called "hit list" of proposed military closures was unveiled by 
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney in January, workers, labor unions and city 
officials have been protesting and picketing to keep the shipyard alive. The 
Navy yard is one of eight on the East and West Coast that repair and restore 
ships, and was the only one to finish its work last year more than $20 million 
below projected costs. 
</P>
<P>
The chorus of protests was joined Monday by Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, who 
spoke at a rally at the Federal Building in Westwood, where more than 100 
shipyard employees took time off work for a protest march. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley promised to lobby Congress to spare the yard. He already has written to 
Cheney and the secretary of the Navy, arguing that the proposed closure would 
be a blow to the entire Los Angeles Basin.

CUSTODY: NEW ZEALAND, A POTENTIAL HAVEN FROM U. S. FAMILY LAW, IS THE LATEST 
BATTLEGROUND IN THE CUSTODY WAR OVER HILARY FORETICH.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As classes let out at the Selwyn House private school for girls, the happy 
children in their brown blazers and Panama hats contrast sharply with the women 
pulling up in their four-wheel-drive station wagons and Jeeps. 
</P>
<P>
The mothers are in a foul mood. As they quickly whisk their daughters away, 
some even spit out obscenities at the reporters who are staking out the school 
in vain hope of glimpsing Hilary Foretich. 
</P>
<P>
"Leave her alone!" one passing motorist shouts. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, we're just doing our job," a sheepish Rick Kirkham of "Inside Edition," 
who had flown in from New York City, mutters to no one in particular. 
</P>
<P>
Already at the center of perhaps America's most wrenching child custody battle, 
Hilary, 7, has suddenly become New Zealand's most famous pupil, now that her 2 
1/2 years in hiding have come to a pandemoniac end. 
</P>
<P>
Her mother, Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, spent more than two years in a Washington 
jail on a civil contempt charge for refusing to divulge Hilary's whereabouts. 
Her father, Dr. Eric Foretich, accused by Morgan of sexually molesting Hilary, 
finally tracked Hilary down to this scenic South Island city, where she is 
living with Morgan's parents. 
</P>
<P>
Foretich has vehemently denied Morgan's accusation, contending it was Morgan 
who did the molesting. 
</P>
<P>
As the focus of the nasty, long-running dispute between her divorced parents 
shifts here, the usually courteous citizens of Christchurch are getting more 
than just a taste of the news media's excesses. 
</P>
<P>
Like it or not, New Zealanders and their particular way of dispensing family 
justice have been thrust into the harsh limelight and both are being sorely 
tested. 
</P>
<P>
After four appeals and $1 million in legal bills in American courts, the fight 
between Morgan and Foretich is being reborn half a world away. 
</P>
<P>
Just as Congress and President George Bush got dragged into the squabble back 
in the United States, so now are New Zealand's prime minister and members of 
Parliament being drawn into the escalating debate. 
</P>
<P>
It remains to be seen whether New Zealand's family court can do any better in 
dealing with the seemingly intractable dispute. 
</P>
<P>
But the legal system appears determined to give it its best shot. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington Friday, the D. C. Court of Appeals released Morgan's passport, 
making her departure to New Zealand imminent. She hopes for a reunion as far 
away as possible from the international glare of attention that has dogged 
Hilary since her discovery. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to arrive with 1 million photographers there to watch me embrace 
Hilary," Morgan said in an interview Friday. "That is not my idea of looking 
out for my daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"This past week has been an enormously upsetting one for her," Morgan 
continued. "I think the first thing that's important for Hilary is to be 
allowed to get back to her ordinary life, and not to have another unexpected 
eruption, no matter how welcome. The best thing I can do for her is to let her 
life settle down and go on from there. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I want very much to see her, but only in a way that's right for 
her," Morgan added. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan and Foretich -- she a once-prominent plastic surgeon, he an oral surgeon 
-- separated shortly before Hilary's birth. Morgan gained custody of the child. 
Then came a custody challenge by Foretich and allegations of sexual abuse by 
Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
The claims of sexual abuse were not proven to the satisfaction of D. C. 
Superior Court Judge Herbert Dixon Jr., and in 1987, Dixon ordered Morgan to 
produce Hilary for unsupervised visits with her father. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan refused and sent her child into hiding. When she refused to reveal 
Hilary's whereabouts, Dixon sent her to jail. She was released last September 
only after Congress enacted, and Bush signed, a law designed specifically for 
her, limiting the time a person can be jailed on civil contempt in child 
custody cases in the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, after discovering that Hilary had been living here since July, 1988, 
with her aging maternal grandparents, Foretich and his lawyers rushed to family 
court here, seeking to force his U. S. court-granted visitation rights. 
</P>
<P>
But a family court judge denied that request and ordered Foretich not to 
contact his daughter. The judge then granted Hilary's grandparents, William and 
Antonia Morgan, temporary custody of Hilary, but took away their passports. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prospect of Elizabeth Morgan's arrival in New Zealand to take up 
her side of the battle clearly disturbs Foretich's U. S. attorneys, who had 
hoped New Zealand would return the case to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
John C. Lenahan, one of Foretich's lawyers, said, "I feel Dr. Morgan has 
thumbed her nose at the court and . . . has tried to further defy (the 
visitation order) by going to New Zealand and seeking to litigate the case 
there. The parties have no business there. This is not a New Zealand case. They 
aren't New Zealand citizens. This is an American case involving American 
parties, and it should be resolved by an American court." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan, however, said "I am very happy" at the prospect of traveling to New 
Zealand, and said she was prepared to stay there as long as necessary -- even 
if it meant she might have to remain there permanently to be with her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan married her second husband, federal appeals Judge Paul Michel, who 
waited for Morgan throughout her two years in prison, in January. Morgan said 
the two discussed all the possible outcomes of the custody fight before their 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
"We both agreed that Hilary came first," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Morgan could have found few better havens against the American family 
law than New Zealand. It has not signed the 1980 Hague Convention on child 
abduction, which calls for the return "forthwith" of any child "wrongfully 
removed" from his or her home jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
The family court here is not bound by any of the actions of U. S. courts in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's child custody laws instruct judges here to "regard the welfare of 
the child as the first and paramount consideration," which often translates 
into allowing a child taken to New Zealand to remain, if the child appears 
settled in the new environment. Since Hilary has been here 19 months, Morgan 
and her parents may be able to meet that criteria easily. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the American courts, the judge here also appointed a lawyer to represent 
Hilary. That attorney, Isabell Mitchell, is conducting her own investigation 
and has hinted she may even look into earlier allegations that Foretich had 
molested another daughter from a previous marriage. Hilary is said to have 
already undergone a psychiatric and sex abuse evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with New Zealand law, all the proceedings are taking place behind 
closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
"They do things completely differently in New Zealand," Morgan said. "My 
understanding is that the court has taken control of Hilary's welfare. In 
completely closed hearings, they will review whatever requests are made, and 
will probably listen most to Hilary's lawyer and the (child abuse) expert that 
Hilary's lawyer is consulting." 
</P>
<P>
According to Patrick D. Mahony, New Zealand's chief family court judge, cases 
such as this will unfold in stages, with attempts at reconciliation and 
mediation preceding any formal hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Since making his only public declarations on the matter -- at a contentious 
meeting with some 30 reporters, a session he terminated abruptly -- Mahony has 
ordered everyone involved to clam up. 
</P>
<P>
Foretich has declined to speak with reporters since his arrival in New Zealand 
last week, saying he intends to respect the wishes of the New Zealand 
authorities. Similarly, the elder Morgans, who granted several candid and 
graphic interviews shortly after they were found here, took the warning to 
heart and abruptly terminated their contacts with the media. 
</P>
<P>
And Elizabeth Morgan, in Washington, warned that she will cease talking to the 
press once she lands on New Zealand soil. "I just cannot take any chances by 
talking to anyone once I get there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony also warned the media that disclosure of family court proceedings could 
lend them in jail under the Guardianship Act of 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Mahony nor anyone else would say when the proceedings might get under 
way, although experts earlier speculated that they could be weeks off. 
</P>
<P>
"The New Zealand court has to decide in their view what is best for this child 
in these circumstances, and they are the ones who decide, not somebody else," 
declared Prime Minister W. Geoffrey Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer ordered Immigration Minister Annette King to reconsider granting 
Hilary's grandparents' application for permanent residency, lest their current 
visas expire next week. 
</P>
<P>
A member of Parliament, Philip Burdon, also has petitioned the Immigration 
Ministry on the Morgans' behalf. 
</P>
<P>
But even a decision on that will not be announced, said a Ministry spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
All this has left reporters from around the world idling about Christchurch. 
The judge's stern caution appears to have had an effect, turning front-page 
saturation coverage in local papers into inside stories by week's end. 
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday night, the country's High Court granted an injunction sought by 
Mitchell, Hilary's court-appointed attorney, seeking to ban a scheduled showing 
of a BBC documentary on the custody battle called "Hilary in Hiding." 
</P>
<P>
Former Principal Family Court Judge Peter Trapski said he was "sickened" and 
"appalled" by the scores of journalists who have desended on New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
The comment that seemed to resonate the most with the public came Wednesday 
night at a rock concert here, when Elton John dedicated a song, "Sacrifice," to 
Hilary. 
</P>
<P>
From a piano top, he lamented that she was being "surrounded by the worst type 
of media" and urged the public to "run the bastards out of town." 
</P>
<P>
His comment -- and the roar of approval from the audience -- were broadcast 
Thursday night as the lead item on New Zealand's network news.

LAKERS SIGN OLDHAM TO 10-DAY CONTRACT

Believing they needed another experienced backup center in preparation for the 
NBA playoffs, the Lakers on Monday signed journeyman Jawann Oldham to a 10-day 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
To make room for Oldham, a nine-season veteran coming back from reconstructive 
surgery on his left knee in March of 1988, the Lakers waived Steve Bucknall. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers already have three centers -- starter Mychal Thompson and reserves 
Vlade Divac and Mark McNamara. But concern about Thompson's injured left heel 
and ankle, plus Divac's inexperience, apparently persuaded the Lakers to sign 
the 7-foot Oldham. 
</P>
<P>
Oldham, an excellent shot-blocker before having the knee surgery, was waived by 
the Sacramento Kings before the season. He played in 15 games for the Santa 
Barbara Islanders of the CBA, and recently played in three games with the 
Orlando Magic. SAM McMANIS

N.J. PROSECUTOR: ALLEGATIONS OF POINT-SHAVING LACK EVIDENCE 
</P>

A prosecutor said Monday he found insufficient evidence to warrant New Jersey 
criminal charges in the alleged North Carolina State point-shaving scheme 
involving former Wolfpack player Charles Shackleford and a Denville 
businessman. 
</P>
<P>
Morris County prosecutor Lee S. Trumbull said his office received details 
earlier in the day of an investigation by Denville police into East Orange 
contractor Robert Kramer. 
</P>
<P>
ABC News said Kramer allegedly paid Shackleford to shave points during the 
1987-88 college basketball season. Denville police chief Howard Shaw said his 
department got involved based on an ABC News reporter's tip. 
</P>
<P>
Shackleford, now a forward for the New Jersey Nets, has acknowledged accepting 
nearly $65,000 while a student, in violation of NCAA rules, but has denied any 
role in alleged point-shaving. 
</P>
<P>
But Trumbull said a review of the Denville police investigation found it 
lacking in "any evidence that would warrant criminal prosecution in this 
jurisdiction." Denville is located in Morris County, where the prosecutor would 
be responsible for pursuing a criminal case in the state's Superior Court 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Matthew Boylan, a Roseland attorney representing Shackleford, said the 
prosecutor's decision "is consistent with what we've been saying all along." 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina authorities are still investigating whether Shackleford, and 
possibly other Wolfpack players, shaved points. 
</P>
<P>
Kramer has told The Charlotte Observer he loaned Shackleford about $6,000 while 
Shackleford played for the Wolfpack. But Kramer said no strings were attached 
to the loans and called allegations of point-shaving "ludicrous." 
</P>
<P>
Boylan said he had not spoken with prosecutors or police about the Denville 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Boylan is representing Shackleford on an unrelated marijuana possession charge 
scheduled to be heard Thursday in municipal court in Orange.

ASSIST REMOVED, MAKING TRIPLE-DOUBLE FROM QUADRUPLE-DOUBLE FOR OLAJUWON

Houston center Akeem Olajuwon will not be credited with a rare quadruple-double 
in a game against Golden State, NBA vice president Rod Thorn ruled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Olajuwon, who had 29 points, 18 rebounds and 11 blocked shots in a 129-109 
victory on Saturday, was originally credited with nine assists in the initial 
postgame box score. 
</P>
<P>
After members of the Rocket staff reviewed video tapes of the game, they 
spotted what they thought was an uncredited assist for Olajuwon with less than 
six minutes remaining in the first quarter on Buck Johnson's basket. The assist 
total was changed to 10. 
</P>
<P>
Thorn said after reviewing the footage of the play in question, an assist 
should not have been awarded.

LOST DAY IN DESERT FOR SEEDED PLAYERS; 
</P>
<P>
TENNIS: CHANG WITHDRAWS, SAMPRAS INJURED AND FIVE TOP NAMES UPSET IN FIRST 
ROUND OF CHAMPIONS CUP.

<TEXT>
<P>
What kind of opening day was it at the $1-million Newsweek Champions Cup tennis 
tournament? 
</P>
<P>
Well, all four seeded players who played were beaten, the defending champion 
lost, Michael Chang withdrew and Pete Sampras was injured and may have to do 
the same today. 
</P>
<P>
Other than that, Monday was fairly routine. But even Sampras had to marvel at 
his extreme bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the weirdest thing that has ever happened to me," he said, shaking his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who won his first pro tournament last week in Philadelphia, cut his 
right thumb and little finger when he slipped on a dirt-covered court playing 
doubles with Jim Courier. 
</P>
<P>
In the first game of their match against Boris Becker and Guy Forget, Courier 
watched Sampras lose his footing and fall on his hand, which was still holding 
his racket. 
</P>
<P>
"When I looked at my thumb, a whole big chunk of skin was gone," Sampras said. 
"Hopefully, I'll be all right for tomorrow. . . . (but) I might not even go on 
the court." 
</P>
<P>
Courier blamed the condition of the court, which had been buffeted by an 
overnight dust storm. Neither the Stadium Court nor the other show court was 
washed. The three outer courts were cleaned, which held up play for more than 
30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Referee Don Wiley said he thought the Stadium Court and smaller Clubhouse Court 
were not as dirty as the outer courts. 
</P>
<P>
Courier said not washing the court was an error. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a mistake," he said. "If they lose Pete, it's a big mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Courier said there was so much sand on the Stadium Court that balls left a 
clean mark when they skidded on the surface. Sampras continued to play, even 
though he could not grip his racket tightly, he said, then retired after Becker 
and Forget won the first set, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
Sampras, seeded 13th, is scheduled to play Ramesh Krishnan today. He left the 
locker room with his thumb and little finger bandaged. 
</P>
<P>
"The court was very dirty," Sampras said. "It really should have been washed. 
Forget almost slipped and went down, too. Just to be safe, they should have 
stopped play for a little bit. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so dangerous and, unfortunately, I had to be the one with bad luck 
today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sampras was not alone in that category, although he was the only one whose 
wound required bandages. There were many other victims after a first round that 
claimed some unexpected casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mats Wilander: The ninth seeded player lost to Swedish countryman Jan 
Gunnarsson, 7-6 (7-4), 6-4, and said afterward that he has lost his drive. 
</P>
<P>
"I was playing bad and never really got into it," said Wilander, whose ranking 
in the last 14 months has sunk from No. 1 to No. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Alberto Mancini: Eleventh-seeded, Mancini was overshadowed by 6-foot-7 
Michiel Schapers, 6-4, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Mancini, who used last year's event here to springboard into the top 10, is 
heading the other way, from No. 14, after his second first-round loss in as 
many weeks and said his confidence is flagging. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Miloslav Mecir: The defending champion experienced back problems again and 
lost to Richey Reneberg, 5-7, 6-3, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just pity I could not give everything I had," said Mecir, who said his 
disk problem is worsening. 
</P>
<P>
Reneberg, who reached the final in Wellington, said he had a problem with the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
"With this new ATP Tour, this should have been taken care of," he said. "The 
whole court was covered in dirt." 
</P>
<P>
Upsets also claimed 10th-seeded Martin Jaite, who lost, 6-1, 6-4, to Goran 
Ivanesevic; and 15th-seeded Andrei Chesnokov, who lost to qualifier Brad 
Pearce, 6-4, 3-6, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Chang was out before even hitting a ball. The 1989 French Open champion, who 
separated a bone in his left hip in a freak injury last December, came back 
last week in Memphis and lost in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Chang received an appearance fee to play in the Volvo/Memphis tournament. He 
was designated to play Newsweek, which, as a championship series event on the 
IBM/ATP Tour, is entitled to have six top-10 players designated.

The NHL Board of Governors, meeting in Rosemont, Ill., did not reach a decision 
on the proposed move of the Minnesota North Stars to the San Francisco Bay 
Area, but passed an amendment to the league's bylaws that could make it easier 
for any team to change cities. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, NHL rules stipulated that a unanimous vote of the board of 
governors was needed to relocate a franchise. The change would allow a team to 
move with simple majority approval under certain circumstances.

The Washington Capitals, seeking goaltending help for their playoff drive, 
acquired Mike Liut from the Hartford Whalers in exchange for journeyman left 
wing Yvon Corriveau on Monday, one day before the NHL trading deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Liut, 34, has a 2.64 goals-against average, second in the NHL to Montreal's 
Patrick Roy. Corriveau, 23, has nine goals and six assists through 50 games 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
In other trades, the Buffalo Sabres sent winger Kevin Maguire to Philadelphia 
for former King defenseman Jay Wells; and the Quebec Nordiques, already

goaltender Greg Millen to the Blackhawks for forwards Everett Sanipass and 
Daniel Vincelette and prospect Mario Doyon.

THE DEATH OF HANK GATHERS; 
</P>
<P>
SPENCER SOLD USC ON WORK ETHIC OF A PHILADELPHIA KID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Spencer was on the telephone Monday, talking about Hank Gathers, when 
call-waiting signaled another incoming call. It was Bo Kimble. 
</P>
<P>
"That was Bo and he needs me, so we have to make this conversation relatively 
quick," said Spencer, who recruited both Gathers and Kimble for USC, where they 
played their freshman seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Spencer was courtside at Gersten Pavilion Sunday when Gathers, a senior at 
Loyola Marymount, collapsed at mid-court while playing against Portland. 
Spencer went to his friend's side and stayed with Gathers' family through the 
night as the tragedy unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, less than 24 hours after Gather's death, Spencer still talks of Gathers 
in the present tense. At times, listening to Spencer, it's as though Gathers is 
still out on a court somewhere, still playing basketball. 
</P>
<P>
But the reality of Gathers' death sounds painfully clear in Spencer's voice, as 
he struggles to speak of a man he likened to a little brother. 
</P>
<P>
"Bo's having a hard time, but he's hanging in there, he's being strong," 
Spencer said. "I think he's doing well. But he needs some support. I need some 
support. We all need each other." 
</P>
<P>
From early on, Spencer, who is from Philadelphia, said he hit it off with 
Kimble and Gathers. He first saw them play basketball at Dobbins Tech High in 
Philadelphia when they were juniors and he was an assistant coach for Stan 
Morrison at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison, who coached Gathers and Kimble at USC, said Spencer knew immediately 
the pair could be the foundation of a team. 
</P>
<P>
"David said to me, 'There is one player who is extremely talented,' that would 
be Bo; 'and another who is the hardest-working player you could ever find,' " 
said Morrison, who now coaches at San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
"But it wasn't like Hank was some slug," Spencer said. "He is an extremely 
gifted athlete, who was very quick and very fast and jumped very high. But yes, 
he's the hardest-working guy I have ever been around." 
</P>
<P>
Spencer said he also saw in Gathers a tremendous amount of pride, both on and 
off the court. 
</P>
<P>
It was that pride, Spencer said, that drove Gathers to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything that Hank undertakes, he goes at it with a desire to be the best," 
Spencer said. "You never see Hank where his hair wasn't combed and his clothes 
didn't look right. Even if he was going down to the corner, he wouldn't be 
caught looking bad." 
</P>
<P>
Spencer works for Leonard Armato, an agent with whom Gathers, Kimble and Tom 
Lewis of Pepperdine were expected to sign this year at the completion of their 
college basketball careers. 
</P>
<P>
"In all probability, it would have happened that Hank would have signed with 
Leonard, but it is against NCAA rules for him to sign prior to the completion 
of his final game," Spencer said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a real awkward thing. On one hand, because I'm working with Leonard, he 
couldn't come right out and say (he's going to sign). But on the other hand, 
anybody with any common sense could see that all things being reasonable, who 
else would he want -- with me being there? 
</P>
<P>
"There wasn't anything clandestinely going on. We are talking about a guy who 
comes over to dinner often and jokes with my wife." 
</P>
<P>
Gathers, Kimble and Lewis' loyalty to both Morrison and Spencer was a major 
factor for their transferring to other schools when Morrison was fired by USC 
and replaced by George Raveling. Spencer also left and took a job at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers and Kimble transferred to Loyola and Lewis to Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
"They felt betrayed by the university," Spencer said. 
</P>
<P>
"I only coached Hank one year at USC, but I would characterize my relationship 
with Hank maybe as an older brother, someone he would seek advice from."

THE DEATH OF HANK GATHERS; 
</P>
<P>
FIRST FALL SIMILAR; 
</P>
<P>
REVIEW OF GATHERS' DEC. 9 COLLAPSE FRIGHTENED SANTA BARBARA COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Although the death of Loyola Marymount star Hank Gathers had UC Santa Barbara 
Coach Jerry Pimm expressing shock and sadness, it also had Pimm recalling his 
team's game against Loyola Dec. 9. 
</P>
<P>
During that game, a 104-101 Loyola victory in the Lions' Gersten Pavilion, 
Gathers collapsed in much the same way he did shortly before his death Sunday 
in a West Coast Conference tournament game against Portland in the same arena. 
</P>
<P>
"The way he fell (Sunday) was similar -- in fact, almost identical -- to what 
happened against us," Pimm said. "He went down without anything to break the 
fall. Then he started to get up again, like he did in our game. But then 
(Sunday) he went into convulsions. I was very frightened then." 
</P>
<P>
Gathers fainted at the free-throw line early in the second half in the December 
game against Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Pimm, sitting at the opposite end of the court, did not immediately think 
anything was seriously wrong with Gathers, who left the game at that point and 
did not return. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was the heat," Pimm said. "It was really hot in there. I was 
sweating like crazy. I thought it was heat prostration." 
</P>
<P>
But while watching a videotape of the game later that night, Pimm saw Gathers' 
fall from a different perspective and got a scare. 
</P>
<P>
"Our camera was set up on the end line, under the basket (Gathers was shooting 
at)," Pimm said. "On our tape, you could see that his eyes were closed and that 
he just crumpled. I was surprised that it wasn't something more than an 
irregular heartbeat. I mean, the way he went down -- boom. . . . His eyes 
closed, and he went down in a hump, quickly. It was frightening, like his brain 
just shut off." 
</P>
<P>
Pimm said he talked to Loyola coaches the next week and sent a note to Gathers, 
who underwent a series of medical tests before returning to the lineup on Dec. 
30. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw that he was in the hospital getting those tests, I thought to 
myself, 'Good. If he does have a problem, they'll find it,' " Pimm said. "I 
mean, Los Angeles is a big city and it has great medical people." 
</P>
<P>
His thoughts now? 
</P>
<P>
"This sure makes you think," he said. "I mean, we give kids physical exams, 
monitor their food and rest. I'm sure Loyola was doing all of those things. 
It's just that sometimes you don't have control. . . . I'm just really shocked, 
because of the type of kid Hank was. He played so hard. He was a thoroughbred."

THIS WAS A STORY THAT WAS TOUGH TO WATCH, AND DIFFICULT TO COVER

<P>
In dealing with a tragedy, television faces a difficult question: What needs to 
be shown, and what, in the interest of taste, should not be shown? 
</P>
<P>
Usually, graphic footage is not available, but Hank Gathers' collapse Sunday 
night happened right in front of television cameras. ESPN had the most complete 
footage, and the cable network showed all of it, including shots of the athlete 
convulsing on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"The feeling here was that besides being newsworthy, the vivid portrayal might 
make people more aware that something like this can happen," ESPN spokesman 
Chris LaPlaca said. "Anyone who sees this isn't going to forget it, and that's 
not all a bad thing." 
</P>
<P>
ESPN did have sportscaster Chris Berman open by warning viewers who might be 
squeamish to turn away. "We didn't just show the footage just to show it," 
LaPlaca said. "This was a major story which we backed up with 12 minutes of 
interviews and reports." 
</P>
<P>
KCBS, KNBC and KTLA all had camera crews at the game, whereas Channel 7 had to 
rely on the ESPN footage. But Channel 7's version was edited. 
</P>
<P>
KNBC used some of its own footage mixed in with some of ESPN's. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to report the facts but you don't want to exploit anything," KNBC 
sports producer Sol Steinberg said. "Our position was, we'd show it once and 
only once." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, all the Los Angeles stations showed proper restraint. The ESPN 
footage was there for any TV outlet to use in its entirety. None did. 
</P>
<P>
And all scrapped any offbeat or light features. It was a night when anything 
like that would have been inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
One thing that was out of line was Channel 2's showing of a woman identified as 
Gathers' mother in hysterics while attempting to use the telephone at Daniel 
Freeman Marina Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Two things were wrong with that. First, the woman, wearing a Loyola Marymount 
sweat shirt, is actually teammate Bo Kimble's aunt, according to school 
authorities. And second, such a shot comes across as an invasion of privacy, no 
matter who it is. 
</P>
<P>
KCBS news director Michael Singer said: "If we misidentified the person, then 
that's a mistake. But I think running the piece was OK. The grief and distress 
people felt was part of the story." 
</P>
<P>
Channel 2's Keith Olbermann deserves credit for going out to the Loyola 
Marymount campus to do a live report. It turned out to be a long day for the 
sportscaster who at times has been criticized for not getting out enough. 
</P>
<P>
Olbermann, who doesn't drive, was out at the Coliseum Sunday morning for the 
start and finish of the Los Angeles Marathon, and he could have sent Tony 
Hernandez to Loyola. But Olbermann took on the tougher assignment and let 
Hernandez handle the studio work. 
</P>
<P>
This was a very difficult story for the local sportscasters. They all knew 
Gathers well. He had plans to someday join their profession, and got to know 
all the professionals. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers served an internship at Channel 5 and spent time at most of the other 
stations in town. Gathers was more than just another star athlete. He was also 
a friend. 
</P>
<P>
At Channel 4, Brett Lewis was filling in for Fred Roggin, who was on assignment 
for NBC. Lewis handled the story with a proper mix of professionalism and 
emotion, as did, for the most part, Olbermann, Channel 5's Ed Arnold, and 
Channel 7's Jim Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 4 showed an interview Lewis did with Gathers, or rather Gathers with 
Lewis, during last summer's sportscasters' camp at Loyola. When Gathers asks 
Lewis for a comment, Lewis says, "I don't talk to the media," and walks off. 
Gathers laughs wholeheartedly. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 2 had maybe the most powerful piece -- an interview with Gathers only 
last Friday in which he said: "I feel great. I'm in the best shape of my life. 
My mom's out here, and I'm looking forward to some good home cooking."

FOR THE RECORD

<P>
TV coverage -- It was incorrectly implied in Tuesday's editions that Channel 7 
had no camera at the Loyola Marymount game the night Hank Gathers collapsed and 
died. Channel 7 had a camera crew on site but used mostly ESPN footage because 
ESPN had better angles.

GREAT AMERICAN SAYS IT WILL SEEK OUTSIDE HELP TO RAISE CAPITAL; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: THE ANNOUNCEMENT TRIGGERS REPORTS THAT THE S&amp;L HAS PUT ITSELF UP 
FOR SALE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Great American Bank, the nation's seventh-largest savings and loan, on Monday 
sought outside help in raising capital to meet federal standards -- a move 
widely interpreted as posting a "for sale" sign on the San Diego institution. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to Great American said it has already begun discussions with a 
number of investors and potential acquirers, including Wells Fargo Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors also were rampant Monday of impending management changes at Great 
American. President Roger Lindland denied, however, through a spokesman, that 
top-level changes were in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
Great American said in a statement that it would hire an investment banking 
firm to help raise the outside capital in order to "accelerate" its plan of 
complying with capital adequacy standards set forth in last summer's S&amp;L 
rescue bill. Wracked by continuing losses from its problem Arizona commercial 
loan portfolio, the 214-branch thrift as of Dec. 31 was deficient in all three 
capital adequacy tests instituted by the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to thrift's board said Great American is looking to raise as much 
as $300 million in outside capital through a sale of stock or warrants, a sum 
that would enable the S&amp;L to meet all three adequacy tests, as well as 
obtain a "buffer" against possible future loan losses. 
</P>
<P>
The yet-to-be-selected investment banking firm "will explore opportunities 
relating to capital investment in Great American, which should accelerate the 
compliance progress outlined in the bank's capital plan," Great American said 
in a statement. But spokesman Brian Luscomb said the S&amp;L was declining 
comment on whether it is offering itself for sale. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a prudent decision that we feel is in the best interest of Great 
American and its shareholders, customers and employees," said Chairman and 
Chief Executive Gordon C. Luce. "We have already received a number of 
unsolicited inquiries from potential investors related to Great American." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Gordon, a stock analyst at Paine Webber Inc. in New York, said Great 
American is "seriously short of capital, so they had to do something. . . . 
They either had to shrink assets or do something like this." With $16.1 billion 
in assets, Great American is the nation's seventh largest savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo declined to comment on a possible acquisition of Great American. 
The San Francisco-based bank is known to be interested in expanding its 
Southern California retail base, but up to now has stayed away from available 
savings and loans, opting instead to purchase a number of smaller community 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
Great American's announcement comes four days after it disclosed that its 
deficient capital levels are soon likely to fall even lower. In an unusual 
statement on Thursday, Great American said its auditor, Deloitte &amp; Touche, 
had decided to extend its review of problem loans in Arizona and the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
The audit extension came two weeks after Great American had released an 
earnings statement showing fourth-quarter and full-year losses for 1989 of 
$59.3 million and $123.9 million, respectively. The extended audit will likely 
result in further loan-loss provisions, deeper fourth-quarter and 1989 losses 
and thus a further erosion of capital. 
</P>
<P>
Great American declined comment on when the extended audit may be completed or 
how large any additional loan-loss provisions may be. 
</P>
<P>
Great American, like other financial institutions, has had its earnings 
severely affected over the past two years by losses in its Arizona commercial 
loan portfolio. Last year, Great American's loan-loss provisions totaled $221 
million, the "great majority" of which were attributable to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's announcement of the audit extension, paired with a Friday story in 
the Wall Street Journal that said the Office of Thrift Supervision had rejected 
Great American's capital compliance plan, sent Great American stock reeling 
Friday, with shares closing down $1.625 to $3.75, a 30% one-day drop. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Office of Thrift Supervision and Great American denied the 
Journal's report that the capital compliance plan had been rejected. The Office 
of Thrift Supervision had simply requested further information, its deputy 
district director, Eric Shand, said. 
</P>
<P>
The stock market responded favorably to the Monday announcement as Great 
American stock closed up 50 cents a share to $4.25 in New York Stock Exchange 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
According to sources, Great American is considering several financing 
alternatives including an outright sale of the S&amp;L. Also being considered 
is a sale of stock and warrants, giving an investor a minority equity position 
now but possibly a controlling interest later. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said the recapitalization process has been stirred up by board 
member Ed Wedbush, whose firm, Wedbush Corp., owns 17% of Great American stock. 
Last month, Wedbush served notice that he would seek permission from regulators 
to take a more active role in management affairs and to possibly raise his 
stake in the S&amp;L.

TREASURER: DON'T BUY JUNK BONDS FOR STATE PENSION FUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS P. SHUIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
State Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes, breaking sharply with the majority of 
directors of the California Public Employees' Retirement System, said Monday 
that the $56-billion pension fund should stop buying junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's stop purchasing these types of investments," Hayes said during an 
unusual public airing of differences with DeWitt F. Bowman, chief investment 
officer of the pension fund, at a news conference in the treasurer's Capitol 
office. 
</P>
<P>
During the news conference, Bowman revealed that in addition to making an 
unsecured loan of $25 million to the now-bankrupt investment firm of Drexel 
Burnham Lambert Inc., the pension fund has $87 million in paper losses stemming 
from the collapse of the junk bond market. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman said that as of March 1, the value of his pension fund's $529.3 million 
worth of "high-yield" bonds had dropped to $442.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
The investment chief said PERS had stopped buying junk bonds temporarily 
because the bond market is "completely unsettled and embroiled in the Drexel 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
But he said he and other PERS officials still believe that the high yields 
associated with the bonds make them a risk worth taking. "The maximum return 
for the system over the long term can be gathered by diversifying the 
investments, taking some risk when it's appropriate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes -- seated next to Bowman at the news conference -- said, "My 
recommendation is: Don't buy any more." 
</P>
<P>
In February, Hayes attempted to persuade other members of the 13-member PERS 
board of directors to temporarily halt the purchase of junk bonds pending a 
review. The vote on his proposed moratorium was 7 to 6. He said he will try 
again at the PERS meeting later this month. 
</P>
<P>
His comments Monday went further than previous statements and seemed to reflect 
the heat of the primary election campaign. Hayes, appointed treasurer by Gov. 
George Deukmejian last year, is running for his first full four-year term this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes has been under fire from his opponent in the Republican primary election, 
Angela M. (Bay) Buchanan, for accepting more than $4,000 in campaign 
contributions from Drexel and its officers. 
</P>
<P>
Buchanan, in Sacramento for campaign appearances, said later that Hayes "should 
give a complete explanation" of the unsecured Drexel loan and should refuse to 
accept any more contributions from investment banking firms. 
</P>
<P>
"In a situation like this, people are going to be concerned that he wasn't as 
tough as he should have been," said Buchanan. "When he's taking money from 
them, when they are helping to finance his campaign, one wonders if there is a 
quid pro quo here." She said she knew that the $25-million loan from the 
retirement fund to Drexel was made in 1986, long before Hayes became treasurer. 
But she said that as treasurer, Hayes should have seen the Drexel debacle 
coming and taken steps to protect the PERS investment. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes said the state has absolutely no control over the loan, a 10-year note 
earning a 10% rate of interest. "It was a private placement. Once you buy it, 
you are basically stuck with it till the end," Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes and Bowman both said they hope PERS will recover most if not all of the 
money owed to it. Hayes said the loan to Drexel was "a business decision" that 
"was not inconsistent with what their policy was at the time, nor what the 
policy is at this time." 
</P>
<P>
Also at the news conference with Hayes and Bowman was Thomas E. Flanigan, chief 
investment officer of the State Teachers Retirement System. He said his pension 
fund, which controls $29.6 billion in investments for retired teachers, decided 
in 1985 not to purchase junk bonds. Basically, Flanigan said junk bonds carried 
just too much risk. Hayes also said that there are no junk bonds in the 
$21-billion investment portfolio that he controls as treasurer.

SHALEK WINS FOX NETWORK'S BIG MEDIA-BUYING BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Shalek Agency grew up Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica ad firm was handed the estimated $20-million to $30-million 
account to buy broadcast commercial time and print and billboard advertising 
space for Fox Broadcasting Co. The account was handled until a year ago by 
giant Western International. Executives at Fox and Shalek declined to state the 
exact amount of billings. 
</P>
<P>
The win nearly doubles the 2-year-old agency's annual billings to $65 million. 
Its staff size also has more than doubled in the past year to about 63 
employees. Almost overnight, the agency seems to have been transformed from a 
creative boutique to a major Los Angeles agency. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of a big small agency, we're now a small big agency," said Nancy 
Shalek, who at 35 is regarded as one of the most influential executives in the 
Los Angeles advertising community. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to give respect back to the ad business in Los Angeles," said the 
outspoken Shalek, who contends that Los Angeles has lost its reputation as a 
creative center for advertising. "I want to be a leader of the Los Angeles ad 
community." 
</P>
<P>
For Shalek, whose agency successfully completed a 10-month trial period with 
Fox, the win represents a key change in direction for the firm. Until now, the 
agency has been best known as a tiny ad shop with exceptional strategic 
planning and creative expertise but sorely lacking in major media buying clout. 
That clout is usually achieved by a West Coast agency when it lands a major 
entertainment or Asian automotive client. 
</P>
<P>
"Much of what the Shalek Agency is about mirrors what we are about," said a Fox 
executive who asked not to be named. "They are young and energetic, as are we." 
</P>
<P>
But ad executives say the Shalek Agency will have its hands full. 
Three-year-old Fox has already gone through several agencies that have bought 
its print and broadcast advertising space. When Fox first established its cable 
network, it turned to Chiat/Day/Mojo for some unusual promotional support, 
including one highly publicized stunt when Fox temporarily changed the 
Hollywood sign to read "Fox Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
Much like its new agency, Fox is regarded as a maverick among its peers. With 
some recently successful shows like "The Simpsons" and "Married With Children," 
Fox finally has something to brag about. The question is, does the Shalek 
agency have the media buying clout? 
</P>
<P>
Even Fox admits Shalek doesn't have the experience. "What it lacks in 
experience it makes up for in the talented people it has hired for media 
buying," said the Fox executive. Two years ago the agency had three media 
buyers. Today it has 15. 
</P>
<P>
"Nancy is a world-class advertising person," said Renee Fraser, general manager 
of the Los Angeles office of the Bozell agency. "What she doesn't have in 
(media-buying) clout she can make up for in brains. She certainly has plenty of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Those who have worked closely with Shalek say she is utterly driven by a desire 
to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"Nancy is determined to make a name for herself, no matter what it takes," said 
Michael Albright, formerly the Shalek Agency's creative director, who recently 
left to start his own agency. "Nancy does a very good job promoting her agency. 
It's probably better known than most of its clients." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, last year the tiny agency, which creates ads for Gibraltar Savings and 
Teleflora, won honors at the West Coast's top advertising competition, the 
Belding Awards, for offbeat print ads it created for former client Gotcha 
Sportswear. The ads featured pictures of oddball characters over the headline, 
"If you don't surf, don't start." 
</P>
<P>
But the agency quickly lost Gotcha, just as it also lost the surf wear client 
that replaced it, Ocean Pacific. Now it is creating unusual swimsuit print ads 
for a new client, Speedo. Perhaps the agency's biggest rap is what some 
executives say is its inability to hang on to many clients for very long. And 
now there is the additional burden of convincing clients that Fox will not 
demand most of the agency's time and talent. Some say the bulk of that talent 
begins and ends in Shalek's office. 
</P>
<P>
"Nancy is one of the brightest persons in the business, but she is a very tough 
leader," said Herbert D. Fried, chairman of W. B. Doner &amp; Co., the 
Baltimore agency that left the West Coast two years ago and sold Shalek its Los 
Angeles office. "Sometimes it works in her favor, and sometimes it doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Helm, who recently formed his own agency, Stein Robaire Helm, said that 
her talent "often overshadows everyone else in the company. That can be 
dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Shalek is familiar with that criticism. After all, even the agency has only her 
name attached to it. But Shalek said that Fox selected the agency, not just the 
person running it. The Fox executive agreed. "The whole agency is tough and 
aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
No matter how big the agency gets, Shalek said, only one thing is really 
important to her. "Advertising is power, and most people abuse that power," she 
said. "I want to create honest ads. I want people to know what an honorable 
profession advertising can be."

UP TO 6,000 LAYOFFS SEEN AT SHEARSON;

WALL STREET: THE AILING COMPANY MAY CLOSE UP TO 50 RETAIL BROKERAGE OFFICES AS 
PART OF A RETRENCHMENT, SOURCES SAY.

<P>
American Express Co. is expected to order a significant number of layoffs -- 
perhaps two or three times the 2,000 already announced -- at its troubled 
Shearson Lehman Hutton brokerage unit in an attempt to stem losses, insiders 
and securities industry analysts said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of American Express' announcement Sunday that it will buy all 
shares of Shearson that it doesn't already own, the firm is expected to move 
swiftly to streamline the unit. Definitive plans will await the outcome of a 
strategic review of all of Shearson's business lines, announced last week by 
Shearson's new chairman and chief executive, Howard L. Clark Jr. 
</P>
<P>
But American Express is expected to deal with several obvious problem areas at 
Shearson, including a real estate lending unit with big exposure to losses. The 
unit, Balcor Co., which specializes in commercial real estate lending and 
property management, has more than $110 million of non-performing loans on its 
books but has reserves to cover losses of only $10 million. In the short term, 
Shearson will probably have to make much larger reserves, while perhaps looking 
for a buyer for the unit or winding down its loan portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
The firm also has a $500-million short-term bridge loan to Prime Computer Inc. 
that it has been unable to convert into marketable junk bonds. Shearson will 
inevitably have to undertake some kind of refinancing of the loan. Lawrence W. 
Eckenfelder, a securities industry analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities, also 
speculated that Shearson may soon substantially curtail unprofitable or 
marginally profitable operations in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Sources also said Monday that Shearson is planning to close between 45 and 50 
retail brokerage offices nationwide as part of a retrenchment that has been 
under way since the firm acquired E. F. Hutton &amp; Co. two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The definitive word Sunday that American Express had abandoned longstanding 
plans to reduce its stake in Shearson sent American Express' stock price 
tumbling Monday as investors anticipated a continuing drag on the parent 
company's earnings. American Express shares closed Monday at $27.50, down 
$1.875, in heavy New York Stock Exchange composite trading of more than 3.4 
million shares. It was the second most active issue on the NYSE. Shearson's 
stock ended the day at $11.875 a share, down 62.5 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Perrin Long, a securities industry analyst with Lipper Analytical Services 
Corp., said the price that American Express is paying to public shareholders 
appears to be fair. He said the transaction probably will be approved without 
difficulty by a special independent committee of Shearson's board set up Sunday 
to review the deal. 
</P>
<P>
American Express currently owns about 61% of Shearson. The merger, through a 
tax-free exchange of stock, was valued at $350 million. This will be in 
addition to a cash injection of $750 million that American Express had already 
announced and $250 million that it contributed to Shearson's capital in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
Shearson currently has slightly more than 35,000 employees, and the firm said 
last week that it would lay off 2,000. Sources said the number inevitably will 
be much higher, perhaps reducing Shearson to 30,000 employees by the end of the 
year. "It's a logical conclusion that if you're going to be streamlining, you 
don't just lose assets," one Shearson insider said. "You'll be losing people as 
well." 
</P>
<P>
The precise areas to be cut remain to be seen. While speculation continued that 
American Express still might wish to sell Shearson if an attractive offer came 
along -- or make some other dramatic move such as splitting up the retail 
brokerage and investment banking units and selling one of them -- Eckenfelder 
and other analysts said such steps are unlikely. They said Shearson could 
probably return to profitability by concentrating on attractive operations in 
both the retail side, which sells stocks and bonds to individual investors, and 
the investment banking side. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the firm's retail brokerage business and certain aspects of its 
investment banking business -- including, at least until recently, mergers and 
acquisitions -- remain profitable. Eckenfelder predicted that Shearson's 
management will examine each product and line of business separately, paring 
selectively rather than making dramatic wholesale cuts. 
</P>
<P>
He estimated that, taking into account a large writedown associated with 
cost-saving measures, Shearson will post a pretax loss for its first quarter of 
between $400 million and $500 million. Eckenfelder said that, even with 
aggressive trimming of assets, it would probably take a year for Shearson to 
return to profitability if the current downturn in the entire securities 
industry continues.

COMPUTER LINE IS UNVEILED BY MOTOROLA

Motorola Inc. on Monday introduced a line of office computers aimed at helping 
the high-technology company become a major contender in a market in which it 
has received little recognition. 
</P>
<P>
The new computers are designed to be operated in a network with machines made 
by other companies, such as IBM and Apple. They are based on the Unix operating 
system, which is becoming the industry standard. 
</P>
<P>
Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Ill., has made computers for years, but they 
primarily have been sold to the federal government or to other computer 
companies that resell them under their own names. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Staiano, president of Motorola's general systems sector, which includes 
cellular phones and computers, said the company intends to become one of the 
major players in the computer business over the next five years. He says it 
will build on its expertise in computer-chip technology and high-quality, 
low-cost manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, we've come out with a set of products that are right on 
the leading edge," said Wayne Sennett, general manager of Motorola's computer 
systems division. 
</P>
<P>
However, some analysts expressed skepticism at Motorola's goals. 
</P>
<P>
"Motorola is doing so many great things in other parts of the company, you hate 
to be negative about their computer effort, but I don't think it has too much 
prospect for success," said analyst Richard L. Whittington of Kidder, Peabody 
&amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
The new computers are "file servers," an increasingly popular form of desktop 
or side-of-desk machine that serves as the central data repository for a 
network of desktop terminals. 
</P>
<P>
Motorola said the computers undercut the price of a similar line of IBM 
machines by 35% or more while offering comparable or better performance. The 
IBM computers, which were introduced with great fanfare last month, were 
praised by experts for their low price relative to performance. 
</P>
<P>
Motorola's machines, called the MultiPersonal Computer line, range in price 
from $23,985 for the MPC100 to $59,985 for the top-end MPC300. Each comes with 
three desktop screens and a side-of-desk processing unit.

India to Pay Interim Relief to Gas Victims: The Indian government said it would 
pay interim compensation for three years of $12 a month to each of 500,000 
people living near the site of the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster. The leak of toxic 
gas from the pesticide plant operated by Union Carbide Corp. in December, 1984, 
killed at least 2,000 people and injured thousands more.

BIG 3 CAR SALES PLUMMET 10.8% IN LATE FEBRUARY

<P>
Late-February domestic sales of cars and light trucks by the Big Three auto 
makers tumbled 10.8% this year compared to the same period last year, when 
expiring incentives attracted buyers to showrooms, the companies said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
New incentives are in effect this year, but they did not generate the 
excitement during late February that was evident in sales figures a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said they sold cars and 
trucks at an average daily rate of 37,143 units during the Feb. 21-28 period 
this year compared to a daily average of 41,624 during the same time last year. 
</P>
<P>
Big Three car sales were down 11.9%, and truck sales declined 8.9%. 
</P>
<P>
Vehicle sales during the first two months of this year were running 1.9% behind 
last year's pace, with a 3.5% rise in truck sales being offset by a 5.2% 
decline in car sales. 
</P>
<P>
With the notable exception of incentives on Chrysler's popular minivans, which 
were in effect only in January, cash rebates and low-interest financing haven't 
sparked buying like they did in the first two months of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Auto makers are waiting to see if purchasing rates pick up in March and April 
as they usually do. Springtime normally is a good sales period for the auto 
makers as winter weather begins to break and Americans hit the road. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the incentive in January and February drained demand from the spring 
buying period. 
</P>
<P>
Ford spokesman Joel Pitcoff said the company's 19.1% decline in late-February 
car and truck sales stemmed from strong fleet sales a year ago, compared to a 
normal period this year. Car sales by the nation's No. 2 auto maker fell 24.5% 
during the period and truck sales were off 10.8%. 
</P>
<P>
For the first two months of the year, Ford's cars and trucks were selling at a 
pace 6.6% behind last year's rate, with car sales down 8.7% and truck sales 
falling by 3.6%. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler said its late-February car sales fell 11.6% and truck sales were off 
21.3%, compared to a year ago, combining for a 16% decline in vehicle sales. 
For the year, Chrysler's car and truck sales, which got a big boost from the 
minivan incentives in January, were up 2%. 
</P>
<P>
GM's car and truck sales for late February ran 2.4% behind last year's pace, 
with car sales off 3.8% and truck sales up 0.9%. For the entire year, GM 
vehicles sold at a pace 0.2% ahead of last year.

LABOR: HOW TEACHERS' UNIONS HOPE TO IMPROVE THE SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Practically everybody agrees that America's schools need momentous 
improvements, but many of the laudable goals set last week by powerful 
political leaders were ridiculously mushy. 
</P>
<P>
Some ideas from others, though, are specific and controversial, such as the 
ones being debated this week by the Kentucky Legislature, which based its 
proposals in part on those offered by Albert Shanker, president of the 
750,000-member American Federation of Teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the mushiest, least useful ideas are those approved last week by the 
nation's governors with support from President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
After studying our education problems at length, the governors and the 
President all agreed that, among other things, by the year 2000 every school in 
the country should be free of drugs and violence and U.S. students should be 
first in the world in math and science. 
</P>
<P>
Great, only they didn't come up with a plan to reach those goals. 
</P>
<P>
Much more specific and therefore far more debatable are the proposals by 
Shanker and those in the Kentucky Legislature to revolutionize our public 
schools by radically changing the way that they teach kids and also offering 
significant monetary rewards to teachers whose students make meaningful 
educational improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Also last week, the 2-million-member National Education Assn. announced 
creation of a National Center for Innovation in Education that NEA President 
Keith Geiger said is the country's widest-reaching network for restructuring 
our schools. 
</P>
<P>
Between them, the two politically potent unions represent nearly 85% of the 2.1 
million primary and secondary school teachers, the most highly unionized 
segment of America's work force. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers' newly intensified campaign to overhaul the school system could 
help the political leaders focus on ways to at least move toward what are now 
only their "pie-in-the-sky" goals. 
</P>
<P>
Both unions are already pushing one radical concept that gives teachers and 
school officials an equal voice in managing their schools. That wise 
power-sharing idea is spreading rapidly and has been started in many large 
cities, including Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Even more radical are some of Shanker's latest proposals. For instance, one 
suggestion is that schools consider having teachers work in teams of six, with 
each team getting the number of students that they normally would teach. 
</P>
<P>
The teacher teams would divide their students into customary class size, but 
teachers and students would remain together for six years, learning together 
and making their own adjustments in schedules and subject matter as they went 
along. 
</P>
<P>
This, Shanker says, would turn the usual bureaucratic assembly-line process of 
educating children into a "teaching and learning enterprise," with teachers in 
successful "enterprises" earning substantial bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers would not have to learn the names and capabilities of many hundreds of 
students over the six-year period, just those on their teams. 
</P>
<P>
Pupils of mixed ability in each class would be divided into groups of five or 
six and be given more responsibility for their own education and for helping 
their teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Lecturing by teachers would be sharply curtailed as student participation 
increased. Teachers would be paid a decent basic salary and compete against a 
norm determined for their own individual school, and all teachers in a school 
whose students progressed above their norm would get a handsome bonus. 
</P>
<P>
This incentive school system would develop an entrepreneurial spirit that would 
stimulate teachers to come up with more of their own ideas for raising the 
educational level of their students, Shanker predicts. 
</P>
<P>
The union's proposal isn't a vague, long-range hope. Some of it is almost 
surely going to be tested soon in Kentucky, where, with the backing of both 
teachers' unions, the Legislature this week is considering an even more 
elaborate plan to restructure schools. 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky got serious about educational reform last year when the state's 
Supreme Court dramatically declared that the whole public school system was 
unconstitutional because it wasn't "efficient," as required by the state 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
The court ordered the state to abide by that vague constitutional mandate by 
next June, and the state's leaders accepted a plan drawn up by, among others, 
David Hornback, an education lawyer. If it passes as expected, it will add 
about 35% to the state's current school budget of $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
During the next two years, base line educational levels will be established for 
each school. In other words, they will be competing against their own record, 
not against one another, for financial rewards. 
</P>
<P>
The base line will be calculated by a sampling of students who will be asked 
essay questions and demonstrate their educational level in ways other than by 
answering multiple-choice questions. 
</P>
<P>
Every two years thereafter another sampling will be taken in each school, which 
will be managed jointly by teachers and principals. Teachers in schools that 
have raised their students' level slightly will get a small bonus, but if they 
are innovative and raise the level substantially, all teachers in the school 
can get bonuses of up to 50% of their annual pay, which now averages about 
$25,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Students in schools where educational levels have dropped 5% or more will have 
the right to transfer to a more successful school. If a school fails to meet 
its norm, more and more students will transfer and teachers and principals in 
the unsuccessful schools would face the loss of their jobs and be required to 
relinquish their decision-making power to specially selected teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Some educators, including Russell Smith, Stanford's dean of education, are 
rightly concerned about placing such a high priority on money as a reward for 
teaching, and NEA President Geiger worries that the plan will further divide 
children into groups of "winners" and "losers." We have too much of that 
already for less fortunate children in ghettos. 
</P>
<P>
But innovative, specific ideas like those proposed by the unions and the 
Kentucky Legislature deserve national attention because without them or other 
equally imaginative proposals, our education system will continue to trail 
those in most other major industrialized countries.

MARKETING: BEER DRINKERS GROUP FROTHING OVER TAXES, BUT ITS PLEAS LEAVE SOME 
MAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Beer Drinkers of America wants you. It wants you to help it fight new taxes on 
beer. It wants you to carry its official membership card. And it wants you to 
send it $5. 
</P>
<P>
If you haven't heard of Beer Drinkers of America, then you're probably not a 
male who owns a truck or a gun -- or subscribes to sports publications. That's 
who the group says many of its members are. 
</P>
<P>
This is a big time of year for Beer Drinkers. The 3-year-old Costa Mesa-based 
organization, which calls itself a nonprofit consumer education and advocacy 
group, just completed a massive membership drive. It mailed more than 1 million 
letters nationwide. The letters ask people to urge representatives to vote 
against new beer taxes. 
</P>
<P>
What the membership letter fails to mention is that two giant brewers -- 
Anheuser-Busch and Miller Brewing Co. -- underwrite more than half of its 
costs. Beer Drinkers won't say how much it receives from the brewers, nor will 
it reveal its annual budget. But Anheuser-Busch and Miller spokesmen confirm 
that they give "substantial" amounts of money to Beer Drinkers. 
</P>
<P>
But Beer Drinkers has also upset some people, particularly parents. Some 
youngsters well under the legal drinking age have received Beer Drinkers 
membership cards. "They're marketing their organization to underage youth, and 
we're opposed to that," said Andy Briscoe, national public affairs director for 
Mothers Against Drunk Driving. 
</P>
<P>
"We've redoubled our efforts to make sure that won't happen any more," said 
Bill Schreiber, executive director of the group. 
</P>
<P>
This year's membership letter is signed by the group's new "honorary chairman," 
Stan Musial, the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Famer. He was paid for his 
endorsement, but Beer Drinkers declined to state how much. Musial, who recently 
underwent cancer surgery, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how much beer you drink and how often you watch TV sports," 
Musial says in the letter. "But unless our fight succeeds, you may pay another 
dollar on each six pack and as much as $300 every year to watch sports on pay 
TV." 
</P>
<P>
These direct-mail membership pitches have been extremely successful. In just 
three years, the group says it has amassed 350,000 members nationwide, 
including 80,000 in California. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly what is Beer Drinkers of America? 
</P>
<P>
Well, it would like to be the National Rifle Assn. of the beer industry. "There 
is a similarity between the NRA and Beer Drinkers of America," Schreiber said. 
"We like to think we would eventually generate that kind of clout." 
</P>
<P>
The group's membership letter says its members are "business executives, 
retirees, skilled laborers, firefighters, sales reps, farm managers, 
accountants and clerks who choose beer as their beverage of choice." And Beer 
Drinkers' patriotism can hardly be questioned. As gifts, its first 50 new 
members this year were sent flags previously flown over the U.S. Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a chance to become a major force that legislators might listen to," 
said Jerry Steinman, publisher of Beer Marketer's Insights, a beer industry 
newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
Before the group signed Stan Musial as spokesman, its paid "honorary chairman" 
was Bobby Unser Jr., the race car driver. In fact, Unser, who lives in 
Albuquerque, played a major role in founding the group three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I was with them from conception," Unser said in a phone interview. But last 
summer, Unser was arrested -- and found innocent -- on charges of drunken 
driving. A judge ruled that the evidence was insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
Unser said that incident has nothing to do with why he is no longer honorary 
chairman of Beer Drinkers. "They wanted me to become more involved and I just 
didn't have the time," he said. "But I still back the program 100%." 
</P>
<P>
Beer Drinkers is especially proud of its "Party Smart Education Project." Under 
this program, the organization distributes literature that emphasizes drinking 
responsibly. The literature was distributed at the New Orleans Hyatt Regency 
before this year's Super Bowl. In fact, Steve Beuerlein, the Los Angeles 
Raiders quarterback, was paid by the group to hand out the brochures there. 
</P>
<P>
Now Beuerlein is the paid "honorary chairman" of the Party Smart program. And 
during the upcoming spring break, he will distribute Party Smart literature in 
Daytona Beach, Fla., and judge a sand-sculpting contest sponsored by Beer 
Drinkers. Beuerlein did not return several calls. But in the group's literature 
he offers several "Tips for Smarter Partying." Among them: "An offensive 
lineman can probably drink more than a quarterback: Know your limit. How much 
you weigh is one of the factors in determining how much you can drink." 
</P>
<P>
Beer Drinkers insists that it is not a beer industry puppet. "We're not 
dictated to or influenced by the beer makers industry," said Schreiber. 
</P>
<P>
But Linda Atkinson, president of MADD's chapter in Albuquerque, the city where 
Beer Drinkers was founded, has her doubts. "If a lot of their money is coming 
from the beer industry," she posed, "how can they help but be influenced by 
them?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Movietime Gets BBDO to Help Change Image 
</P>
<P>
Movietime won't be Movietime much longer. And although it is changing its image 
-- and name -- the cable channel has also handed its estimated $3-million 
advertising account to BBDO Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The channel, received by about 1.2 million households in the Los Angeles 
market, is trying to broaden its offerings from movie news to more general 
entertainment coverage. And its new ad agency will be in charge of getting that 
message across. "We're going to totally reposition the network," said Sheri 
Herman, senior vice president of marketing. "You won't recognize us." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Saatchi Gets Another Account From Yamaha 
</P>
<P>
When an ad agency has turmoil at the top, that's usually when clients back 
away. 
</P>
<P>
But only a few weeks after Saatchi &amp; Saatchi DFS/Pacific underwent its 
second major shuffle of top management, one of its largest non-automotive 
clients awarded the agency new business. Yamaha Motor Corp., which already has 
the agency creating its motorcycle and snowmobile ads, awarded its estimated 
$2-million power equipment business to the agency. Yamaha's total ad billings 
at Saatchi DFS exceed $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Psychologically, it was a big win for us," said Joe Cronin, president of the 
agency, whose biggest client is Toyota Motor Co. "The best way to grow is 
through existing clients." Among the new products that the agency will handle 
are Yamaha lawn tractors, generators and snow blowers. But what does an agency 
in Torrance know about creating snow-blower ads? "I'm originally from Boston," 
said Cronin. "I know a thing or two about snow." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Maybe Agency's Third Time Will Be Charmed 
</P>
<P>
Jack Mealer says he feels like the Billy Martin of advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball's outspoken Martin was repeatedly hired and fired as New York Yankee 
manager by owner George Steinbrenner. And over the past 10 years, Mealer's 
Costa Mesa agency, Roberts/Mealer/Cunningham, has been through a similar 
revolving door with Cahn Instruments, a Cerritos maker of specialized measuring 
devices. 
</P>
<P>
It was just re-hired by the company for the third time last week. "They found 
out the grass really wasn't greener," said Mealer, who this time has a one-year 
contract with the client. "To tell you the truth, I was afraid to call Jack 
this time," said Linda Raabe, marketing services manager at Cahn Instruments. 
"I figured he'd hang up on me." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Bozell Hires Newhoff for Top Creative Post 
</P>
<P>
Less than one month after the Los Angeles ad agency Abert Newhoff &amp; Burr 
called it quits, one of its founders has been grabbed by another Los Angeles ad 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
Mel Newhoff, who was president of the agency, has been named executive creative 
director of the Los Angeles office of Bozell. Newhoff could not be reached for 
comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the kind of talent we need to compete in the Los Angeles marketplace," 
said Renee Fraser, general manager of Bozell. Newhoff replaces Hy Yablonka, who 
recently took on wider corporate responsibilities with Bozell. Newhoff will 
report to Fraser.

CLEAN AIR ACCORD ASSAILED AS BEING WEAK ON CONTROLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON

<TEXT>
<P>
State and local environmental officials on Monday attacked a recent compromise 
on clean air legislation, charging that the White House-Senate accord is not 
strong enough to ensure healthy air and in some cases would weaken existing 
law. 
</P>
<P>
As the Senate opened debate on the landmark agreement between the Bush 
Administration and a bipartisan Senate coalition, the environmental officials 
said they would fight for a series of amendments that would tighten controls on 
tailpipe emissions and industrial sources of pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for organizations representing pollution controllers in more than 250 
cities, states and territories said they were joining forces with environmental 
groups that already had announced plans to battle for changes in the 
legislation, including much stronger regulation of cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg (D-N.J.), a critic of the compromise, conceded 
that he and his allies were badly outnumbered and that the chances for making 
major changes in the new Senate bill now appeared slight. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we can change the equation somewhat," Lautenberg said at a news 
conference. "I am hopeful but not optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), a major architect of the 
compromise who has vowed to resist all amendments, told reporters that it was 
"the best bill that can pass the Senate." 
</P>
<P>
The House is considering similar legislation but its measure has been bottled 
up in committee for months, awaiting Senate action. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise plan came under heavy fire from James M. Lents, executive 
officer of the South Coast Air Quality Management District in Los Angeles. 
Lents also is president of the 220-member Assn. of Local Air Pollution Control 
Officials. 
</P>
<P>
"This proposed compromise is a bad deal for the American people," Lents said. 
"It compromises public health. . . . It even compromises the past by gutting 
key provisions of the existing Clean Air Act (and) creates loopholes through 
which states can take a dive on cleanup efforts." 
</P>
<P>
Lents said that the agreement would eliminate the Environmental Protection 
Agency's duty to adopt a comprehensive federal implementation plan if a state 
failed to adopt sufficiently strong measures to achieve air quality standards. 
</P>
<P>
He also criticized provisions of the compromise that would allow local areas to 
obtain waivers for compliance with standards if control measures were not 
considered to be cost-effective. 
</P>
<P>
"These loopholes will encourage procrastination and divide the nation," he 
said. "They are designed, whether by purpose or chance, to force local elected 
officials to make an either-or choice between jobs and public health. . . . 
States seeking economic development will be openly bidding for industrial 
growth based upon who does less to clean up the air." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley Beckham, spokesman for the State and Territorial Air Pollution Program 
Administrators, said that the compromise is too lenient on motor vehicle 
pollution, which accounts for 90% of carbon monoxide and half of all nitrogen 
and carbon dioxide in the air. 
</P>
<P>
"The gains that we made in the past will fall by the wayside," Beckham said. 
</P>
<P>
A number of senators, including Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) and Alan Cranston 
(D-Calif.), are planning to offer a series of amendments to the compromise. The 
Senate will begin considering amendments today.

BIG PRICE TAG FOR INSURANCE PLAN SCORED; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: SULLIVAN SAYS THE PEPPER COMMISSION'S $66-BILLION PROPOSAL COULD HURT 
BUSINESSES. THE PANEL URGES MANDATORY MEDICAL COVERAGE FOR ALL WORKERS.

A congressional commission's plan for mandatory health insurance for all 
workers was attacked Monday by Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. 
Sullivan, who said it would cause small businesses "to go under, with the loss 
of jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, delivering the Bush Administration's first formal response to the 
$66-billion program proposed last week by the Pepper Commission, said the 
Administration is worried about any health reform program "if the cost to the 
business community is too great." 
</P>
<P>
The commission plan calls for free insurance for pregnant women and children up 
to 6 in poor families, 90 free days of nursing home care and government paid 
home care for the severely disabled. All firms with 100 or more workers would 
be required to offer health insurance to their employees or pay into a public 
plan for the uninsured. Smaller companies would be offered tax credits and 
subsidies to encourage them to purchase insurance for their workers. After five 
years, any remaining uninsured workers would be covered by the public plan. 
</P>
<P>
It "is a very expensive program," said Sullivan, testifying before the House 
Aging Committee. 
</P>
<P>
He said congressional enactment of the commission proposal could result in a 
"catastrophic outcome," a reference to the controversial expansion of Medicare 
repealed by Congress last year. Taxpayers over the age of 65 revolted against a 
special surtax, which would have financed extended free hospital care, placed a 
ceiling on doctor bills and paid part of the cost of prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration is determined to fight any new program that requires 
higher taxes. An expansion of health insurance to cover 37 million Americans 
now lacking coverage would require expanded yearly outlays of $66 billion for 
the federal government and $20 billion for business. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to develop a program that is not only effective at delivering services 
but is mindful of costs," Sullivan said. The United States spends more than any 
other nation for health care, $2,200 for every American, compared with $1,400 
for each resident of Canada, the second biggest spender. "Simply (spending 
dollars) will not provide us with the best health," Sullivan said. "If it did, 
we would be the healthiest nation in the world and we're not." 
</P>
<P>
The United States is surpassed by a number of countries in general measures of 
health such as life expectancy and infant mortality. 
</P>
<P>
Despite prodding from the committee chairman, Rep. Edward R. Roybal (D-Los 
Angeles), and other members, Sullivan refused to offer an Administration 
alternative to the Pepper Commission plan for mandatory insurance coverage for 
business. The commission is named for its first chairman, the late Rep. Claude 
Pepper (D-Fla.). 
</P>
<P>
Two separate health reform studies are under way by the Administration, with 
the results going to the Cabinet domestic policy council, which is expected to 
prepare recommendations in the fall, the HHS secretary told Roybal. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration agrees that uninsured Americans should be offered protection 
against high medical bills, Sullivan said, but is worried about the added 
burden for business. 
</P>
<P>
The repeal of the catastrophic care expansion of Medicare shows that "good 
intentions can have unintended consequences, particularly if they carry a high 
price tag," he said. "We do not want another catastrophic outcome on our hands, 
and my concern is that the almost $100-billion price tag on the Pepper 
Commission proposals, involving public and private costs, could result in just 
that." 
</P>
<P>
However, committee chairman Roybal said Congress should use the Pepper 
Commission plan as the basis for health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing a separate issue, Sullivan, whose department also administers the 
Social Security system, brushed aside suggestions to reduce Social Security 
taxes, a proposal offered by Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan (D-N.Y.). 
</P>
<P>
"Social Security is certainly not broken and it does not need 'fixing,' either 
by undermining the financial condition of the trust funds or by making 
ill-advised changes in the structure of the Social Security Administration," 
Sullivan said.

KAIFU REBUKED FOR PROMISING BUSH TOO MUCH

Opposition leaders in Parliament on Monday rebuked Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu 
for promising too much to President Bush, and Kaifu deflected criticism by 
playing down the commitments he made during the summit weekend in Rancho 
Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
The core issue in the session, during which Kaifu answered questions on the 
policy speech he gave Friday before departing for his rush visit to Southern 
California, was the dispute over revision of Japan's controversial consumption 
tax. 
</P>
<P>
But the prime minister also took heat from the opposition for his attempt at 
statesmanship. 
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister Kaifu, what on earth did you promise to the President?" Takako 
Doi, chairwoman of the Japan Socialist Party, asked Kaifu in a mocking tone. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu, who assured Bush he would exert political leadership at home to remove 
structural trade barriers in the Japanese economy and cut Japan's $49-billion 
trade surplus with the United States, appeared to be backing away from that 
challenge, one day after his return. 
</P>
<P>
"The summit was not a negotiation and not something leading to an accord," 
Kaifu told Parliament. "We held sufficient generalized discussions, but we 
didn't touch upon specific issues such as the contents of the 301 (unfair trade 
complaints) or the large retail store law or the rice market." 
</P>
<P>
The opposition, led by Doi and her Socialists, won a majority in the upper 
house of Parliament last summer, partly because it wooed the votes of farmers 
and small retailers by campaigning on a protectionist platform. 
</P>
<P>
Yomiuri, the country's largest daily, warned in an editorial Monday against 
making a scapegoat out of Kaifu for Japan's trade woes. 
</P>
<P>
"We should not blame Kaifu alone for the current state of affairs," it 
editorialized. "Japan invited this crisis by not seriously addressing problems 
that existed long before the prime minister took office."

COLD WIND OF CHANGE IN EASTERN EUROPE SENDS A CHILL THROUGH DAMASCUS REGIME; 
</P>
<P>
SYRIA: THE NATION HAS NO HARD CASH. AND THE KREMLIN HAS ALREADY SAID THAT PURSE 
STRINGS WILL BE TIGHTER, ESPECIALLY FOR ARMS.

DAMASCUS, Syria 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Through periods of drought and permanent inefficiency, the Syrian economy has 
hobbled along on the proceeds of oil exports and the crutch of soft credit and 
barter trade with the Soviet Bloc. The crutch has begun to wobble. 
</P>
<P>
The Damascus government has no hard cash. Its oil earnings are spent on 
imported wheat. And when the leaders of Comecon, the Soviet-dominated East 
European economic union, sat down in Bulgaria in January and tentatively 
embraced a free-market system with hard-currency payments, the echo resounded 
here. 
</P>
<P>
"The effect won't be immediate, because the East Bloc is still not certain how 
to reach its goals," said a Damascus-based Western diplomat. "I'd say the 
direction of trade won't change in the near term, but the level will drop." 
</P>
<P>
Added another: "The East Europeans will now be looking for foreign exchange to 
build there own economies. They'll find none here." 
</P>
<P>
The tumultuous changes in Eastern Europe were bound to send political and 
economic shock waves through Damascus, long the Soviet Union's prime client in 
the Middle East. Even before the Iron Curtain parted, however, Syria had been 
put on notice that Soviet purse strings would be tightened, particularly on 
military shipments. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Ambassador Alexander Zotov insisted recently that Damascus and Moscow 
will maintain their "special relationship," but the arms component of Soviet 
exports has already built a Syrian debt estimated at up to $15 billion -- which 
the Syrians have been unable to repay. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Syrian reliance on Eastern Europe in other areas may be affected by 
political changes. The East Germans, for instance, have trained the Syrian 
security forces, as they have for socialist countries in other regions. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, as the leading hard-liner against Israel, Damascus shares the 
concern of other Arab governments over developing ties between Jerusalem and 
the capitals of Eastern Europe. Only Romania had retained diplomatic relations 
with Israel after the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, but Hungary and Czechoslovakia 
have resumed ties, and Poland is expected to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade between Damascus and East European countries has been sustained 
under the socialist umbrella -- Syria is officially a socialist state -- 
through exchanges of European consumer and industrial goods for Syrian raw 
materials, primarily phosphates and cotton. The Soviet Union, East Germany, 
Romania and Czechoslovakia are major trading partners, although France leads 
the list with its large wheat exports. 
</P>
<P>
In the estimation of several diplomats here, the barter agreements have brought 
Syria a stream of shoddy goods with poor inventories of spare parts. "Last 
fall, their fleet of East Bloc buses became so decrepit that the government 
authorized purchases of spares from any source," one diplomat noted. 
</P>
<P>
Now, if the East European industries retool to produce higher-quality exports, 
the Syrians may be priced out of the market and may have to look elsewhere for 
trading partners. 
</P>
<P>
The Arab nations, busily forming economic unions from which Damascus so far has 
been excluded, would be the natural choice, but many of them have 
long-established trade ties with the West. And other than oil, for which 
there's little demand in the Middle East, Syria can offer only second-rate 
products in small lots. And it has no money. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to buy something to sell something in the real world," a foreign 
economic analyst observed. "With Comecon, neither side had good products, but 
the East Europeans offered credit. Those credit facilities are probably going 
to change." 
</P>
<P>
Its Arab neighbors have already cut off financial aid to Syria under the 1978 
Baghdad Pact, which provided funds for the so-called confrontation states with 
Israel. Diminishing Arab oil revenues over the past decade were a factor, but 
so was Syrian support for non-Arab Iran in its long war with Iraq. Damascus has 
received no Arab aid since December, 1988, diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
Although American oil companies -- Unocal, Marathon, Occidental Petroleum and 
others -- are active in exploratory work here, most U.S. businesses are 
prohibited from trade with the Damascus government because it provides 
sanctuary for armed groups identified by U.S. authorities as terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
Oil exports sustain what otherwise is a dismal economy, and even petroleum 
earnings barely cover the loss of Arab aid, economic analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
The picture is getting bleak. One diplomat estimated that at least half the 
wages of a poor family goes to buy bread. Double-digit inflation has damaged 
living standards of the middle class, and now the poor, with access to 
subsidized rations, are feeling the pinch. 
</P>
<P>
Still, large sectors of the Syrian economy are in private hands -- agriculture, 
commercial shops, the big hotels. In the parallel economy -- the black market 
-- anything is available with patience and at a price. It is endemic official 
corruption at the borders that brings variety to the Syrian shops. 
</P>
<P>
"Take medicines," a hotel worker explained. "My wife needs a compound that's 
not found here. So I go to the pharmacist, place my order and come back in 
three or four days. He's got it. He got it from Lebanon." 
</P>
<P>
Said a foreign resident of the smugglers: "It's not three donkeys up the 
ravine. It's 15 tractor-trailer loads coming down the highway."

DREAM OF UNITY RISES AGAIN IN ARAB WORLD; 
</P>
<P>
REGIONAL POLITICS: EGYPT AND SYRIA HAVE PATCHED UP THEIR RIFT. BUT OTHER 
CONFLICTS REMAIN.

<P>
The Arab world, struggling for a new foothold after a decade of war, intramural 
squabbling and economic crisis, has launched a drive for political 
reconciliation that has awakened hopes for unity in the Middle East for the 
first time since the Camp David accords. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most troublesome regional conflicts still elude a solution. But 
Egypt's rapprochement with Syria in December and other recent moves toward 
reconciliation signal a new attempt by the Arab world to close ranks and revive 
-- in a calculated, pragmatic way -- a modern vision of the old dream of Arab 
unity, diplomats and political analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
Recent moves to patch up old squabbles among Arab nations also reflect what 
many analysts say is an end to the Cold War in the Middle East, now less of a 
potential flash point for conflict between the superpowers and more an area of 
complex economic and political dilemmas needing solutions on a regional scale. 
</P>
<P>
Arab regimes, analysts say, are focusing less these days on philosophical 
debates and more on the challenges of an economically united Western Europe and 
a new, restless Arab middle class that could be the greatest threat to some of 
the region's dictatorial leaderships. 
</P>
<P>
"The historical images and scenarios are changing. The Middle East of today is 
a Middle East that is undergoing domestic and inner change, and it is a Middle 
East in a different world," said Tahseen Basheer, an Egyptian political analyst 
and former spokesman for the late President Anwar Sadat. 
</P>
<P>
"In the '80s, everyone was trying to change the established order by force, and 
all of them failed. . . . It came to naught, and the Egyptian way of doing it, 
in small, patient measures, has paid off," he said. "So now in the '90s, with a 
lot of new challenges deep from within, they realize that instead of competing 
with each other, they need to coalesce their regimes, to help each other and 
not to undermine each other." 
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic of the recent moves was the restoration in December of 
diplomatic relations between Egypt -- a virtual outlaw in the Arab world a 
decade ago when it made peace with Israel -- and Syria, the most intractable 
critic of any resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict short of the elimination 
of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Though most Arab countries warmed up to Cairo last year, readmitting Egypt to 
the Arab League and restoring full relations, Syria had remained aloof. But a 
variety of regional and international developments combined to force Damascus 
into reconciliation, according to diplomats and political sources here. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the same forces have prompted other moves toward Arab harmony in recent 
months. The results: at least partial reconciliation between renegade Libya and 
two of its closest neighbors, Egypt and Jordan; talk of reunifying Yemen with 
Marxist South Yemen, and even some reports that radical Palestinian factions 
nurtured by Syria might seek reconciliation with Yasser Arafat's mainstream 
Palestine Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most important in the region's changing scene has been the Soviet 
Union's virtual withdrawal from the Middle East as an arena for international 
conflict, most analysts agree. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, conflicts in places like the 
Israeli-occupied territories and Lebanon assumed alarming international 
proportions because of the historic U.S. support for Israel and the Soviets' 
support for regimes like Syria and Libya that have sought the elimination of 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, however, the Soviet Union has made it clear to Syria and 
other Arab countries that it no longer sponsors strategic parity with Israel. 
Moscow says it will provide defensive weapons to countries like Syria but not 
arms for an offensive against Israel -- effectively backing away from a 
regional arms race with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Moscow has warmed its relations with Israel and Egypt. And, 
while not actively participating in the U.S.-brokered peace process with the 
Palestinians, Moscow has encouraged the PLO to adopt a more moderate diplomatic 
stance, including tacit recognition of Israel and renunciation of terrorism, 
that would allow the process to move forward. 
</P>
<P>
"The world of polarization in the Middle East vis-a-vis the superpowers is 
coming down," said one Arab diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
Syria, faced with reduced Soviet support and increased isolation from other 
Arab states because of its support for Iran in its war against Iraq, had little 
choice but to reconcile with Egypt, which is rapidly regaining its position at 
the diplomatic forefront of the Arab world, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Economics have also spurred the new move toward Arab unity, particularly in 
countries like Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco and Libya, where there are worries 
that the 1992 economic unification of Western Europe will threaten some of 
their most important export markets. 
</P>
<P>
The North Africa tier recently launched an official multi-state union to 
provide a united economic front. Similar regional groupings have emerged among 
the oil-rich Persian Gulf states and in the central region, where Egypt, Iraq, 
Jordan and Yemen have formed the Arab Cooperation Council. 
</P>
<P>
"Regional groupings are the wave of the future," one Western diplomat said.

IN BEIRUT, MAIL GOES THROUGH -- AT $20 A LETTER;

LEBANON: TAXI DRIVERS BRAVE MINED ROADS, SNIPERS AND SHELLING TO DELIVER

Domestic postage in Lebanon is the equivalent of three cents, but these days 
desperate Lebanese are paying $20 to get a letter from West Beirut to East 
Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
With an inter-Christian war raging in the eastern sector, even the Lebanese 
equivalent of Federal Express isn't working. Mined roads, snipers and outbreaks 
of shelling have put a stop to the normal mail system. 
</P>
<P>
But the Lebanese flair for finding a way around even mines and snipers took 
only a short time to develop during the latest fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Lebanon Taxi, in West Beirut, now offers a mail and grocery home-delivery 
service to East Beirut. For $20, a driver will deliver a letter to the eastern 
sector from worried family members in West Beirut. For an extra couple of 
dollars you can send bread, bottled drinking water and fruits and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I thought 10,000 pounds ($20) was terribly expensive," said one 
Christian living in West Beirut. She had not had any news of her relatives in 
the East Beirut quarter of Ashrafiyeh for two weeks after fighting broke out 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
"But when I got a letter back from them, I found it very cheap," she conceded. 
</P>
<P>
Phone lines were ripped down by artillery, which have been fired at such close 
range that few buildings remain intact in many areas. 
</P>
<P>
When the Christian letter-sender heard the driver also would carry food, she 
rushed to the nearest bakery to buy two large bags of the flat loaves of Arabic 
bread that is basic to the Lebanese diet. From the vendor on the corner she 
bought 30 pounds of eggplant, carrots, apples, bananas, oranges and tomatoes. 
She topped off the package with bottled drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours, the driver was back in West Beirut with a letter from her 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
"There are tears in my eyes as I write this letter," the woman's cousin said. 
"We aren't dying, but we're suffering greatly." 
</P>
<P>
The cousin asked that her West Beirut relative telex her two daughters living 
in London. "Tell them that I love them" was her only message. 
</P>
<P>
"When the families see us coming with messages and food, the women start 
crying," one of the taxi drivers said. "But inside their hearts, everyone is 
crying." 
</P>
<P>
The drivers, who are Muslims, know Beirut from the days before it was divided 
into East and West. Few streets have name signs, so it is their expertise that 
sees them through. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are taking people across, like the press, we carry letters for free," a 
driver explained. "It's a humanitarian gesture." 
</P>
<P>
They admit they are risking their lives but believe that a good deed means "God 
will repay us by keeping us safe."

EXECUTIONS BY PALESTINIANS MAY ALSO HURT UPRISING;

<TEXT>
<P>
Israeli-occupied West Bank Twice this year, self-appointed rebel executioners 
have forced a suspected collaborator into the central mosque here and made him 
foretell his death over a loudspeaker. 
</P>
<P>
Then the victims were killed. One was hacked and slashed first; the other was 
beaten, kicked and trampled. 
</P>
<P>
Killings such as these have become an important feature of the Palestinian 
uprising, known as the intifada. Now, the executioners' weapons are competing 
with the stones thrown by young people as symbols of the revolt. 
</P>
<P>
The slayings of Palestinians suspected of cooperating with the Israeli army and 
secret police -- carried out in defiance of pleas by Palestinian leaders -- are 
more than keeping pace with killings at the hands of Israeli soldiers. So far 
this year, 19 Palestinians have been killed by other Palestinians; 18 have been 
killed by soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
The persistence of Palestinians killing Palestinians has raised questions about 
the hold the public Palestinian leadership has on grass-roots activists. Those 
who hope to persuade Israel to agree to a new Palestinian state have been 
placed on the defensive. Indeed, many Palestinians now fear that the killings 
may eventually undermine the uprising. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not want someone taking to himself the power to decide who is 
participating enthusiastically in the intifada and who is not," a Palestinian 
activist in Jerusalem said the other day. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these executions have taken place in the occupied Gaza Strip, where 
Islamic fundamentalist groups sometimes strike at Palestinians believed to be 
involved in drug dealing and prostitution. On the West Bank, Palestinians have 
become alarmed about renegade groups of masked men carrying out attacks on 
nationalists and robbing stores and homes. 
</P>
<P>
Beit Furik, an impoverished farm town near Nablus, has a long history of 
fighting the Israelis. In 1967, Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine 
Liberation Organization, escaped pursuing Israeli soldiers by hiding in the 
basement of an old house here. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 27, young men forced Ali Nasasra into Beit Furik's mosque, where 
according to witnesses he confessed to informing on Palestinians. Nasasra had 
been banished from the village 20 years ago because, residents say, he worked 
for Shin Bet, Israel's domestic intelligence agency. 
</P>
<P>
He was found at the home of a relative and seized by about a dozen men armed 
with hatchets and knives. His captors, members of a Nablus-based group called 
Revolutionary Security, said he would be subjected to the "justice of the 
people." 
</P>
<P>
As Nasasra, 45, left the mosque, scores of people beat him with sticks, kicked 
him and trampled him to death. 
</P>
<P>
In January, a group of masked youths dragged Mohammed Hatatbeh, 53, to the Beit 
Furik mosque, where he was forced to confess over the mosque's sound system. He 
was said to have admitted to leading two Palestinian gunman into a fatal army 
ambush in 1969 and to cooperating with the Israelis ever since. 
</P>
<P>
After confessing, Hatatbeh was released -- but two days later, masked 
executioners came to his home, took him to a square and hacked him to death 
with axes. The blood-soaked ground where he died has been left undisturbed as a 
warning to others, youths in the village told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"The collaborator was dangerous," one of the youths said. "He was responsible 
for the deaths of two of our fighters, and he continued to work for the 
Israelis." 
</P>
<P>
The youth, who gave his name as Najib, guided the reporters to the scene of the 
killing. When asked why Beit Furik rebels had disobeyed Palestinian leaders' 
orders to stop killing suspected informers, he responded with a familiar 
refrain: 
</P>
<P>
"Arafat is not here. He does not know our situation." 
</P>
<P>
Najib insisted that Hatatbeh was given a trial and that his killing was 
necessary in view of the risks the rebel activists take in their battle with 
the Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
The killing of suspected collaborators began in earnest last summer. At first, 
Palestinian leaders and PLO members justified the deaths on grounds that the 
informers were placing activists in mortal danger by identifying them to the 
Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, according to Israeli intelligence experts, the Shin Bet 
recruited many informers in the West Bank and Gaza and still has thousands of 
them on its payroll. 
</P>
<P>
Some Israeli politicians, including the hawkish Ariel Sharon, a member of 
Parliament, have suggested that armed collaborators be unleashed on the 
nationalists as a way to quell the intifada. 
</P>
<P>
As the number of executions mounted, the PLO announced that it alone could 
authorize an execution. But the killing continued. 
</P>
<P>
At least 170 Palestinians are believed to have been killed by other 
Palestinians since the uprising began 27 months ago, all but about 30 of them 
since last June. 
</P>
<P>
By November, the uprising's public leadership had become alarmed. Faisal 
Husseini, one of the few widely recognized voices of the uprising, went from 
village to village appealing for an end to the killing. 
</P>
<P>
The executioners resist discipline. Said Kanaan, a Nablus businessman and 
longtime pro-PLO contact, recalled that last November he tried to deliver a 
letter containing an appeal from Arafat to a nationalist group known as the 
Black Panthers, responsible for slaying at least eight suspected collaborators 
in Nablus. 
</P>
<P>
"They took the letter and asked me to prove it was authentic," Kanaan said. "I 
tried to assure them, but they threw the letter up in the air and shot at it. 
They demanded that Arafat make a speech on radio." 
</P>
<P>
Arafat complied, but it is not clear whether his appeal succeeded in cooling 
their ardor.

POSTAL SERVICE TO TELL PLAN FOR 30-CENT STAMP 
</P>

<P>
The U.S. Postal Service, losing nearly $4 million a day, will announce today a 
plan to increase the cost of mailing a first-class letter from 25 to 30 cents 
early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Mailing costs for magazines, advertisements and packages also would increase 
under the proposal, with the average cost of all postage going up 19%, postal 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The rate request, designed to generate an estimated $7 billion a year in 
additional revenue, must be approved by the Postal Rate Commission, which has 
10 months to decide. 
</P>
<P>
Postal costs will have risen 46% faster than the rate of inflation between 
April 3, 1988, the date of the last increase, and next January, if the increase 
is approved, according to Postal Service figures. 
</P>
<P>
Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank said the rate increase is essential. "I 
think that most fair people realize that postal costs go up and that rates must 
go up to cover them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Frank said escalating health insurance costs, congressionally mandated 
contributions to the U.S. Treasury to reduce the federal deficit, overly 
optimistic estimates of labor savings in 1988 from the introduction of new 
technology and failing to request a 26-cent first-class stamp three years ago 
contributed to the increase. 
</P>
<P>
He said also that the Postal Service reached a settlement with its unions in 
the last 1987 contract that "in retrospect, could have been rethought." 
</P>
<P>
"Two years of waste and mismanagement" is the cause, said Gene A. Del Polito, 
executive director of the Third Class Mail Assn., which represents advertising 
mailers. 
</P>
<P>
"The 46% inflation difference is almost totally a result of their inability to 
capture the productivity savings they thought they would get through the 
introduction of technology," said Hal Orenstein, senior financial analyst for 
the Postal Rate Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent R. Sombrotto, president of the National Assn. of Letter Carriers, 
defended the higher rates, saying that over the last 20 years, inflation has 
exceeded the increase in postage costs.

21 PICKED AS JUDGE BEGINS TO FILL JURY POOL FOR POINDEXTER TRIAL

Twenty-one people, including a lawyer who worked for the Bush presidential 
campaign, were chosen as prospective jurors Monday for the Iran-Contra trial of 
former National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter. 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter is charged with five felony counts -- one of conspiracy, two of 
obstructing Congress and two of making false statements to congressional 
committees -- in connection with accusations that he covered up Oliver L. 
North's secret Contra resupply network and lied about a 1985 shipment of Hawk 
missiles to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene disqualified 76 people from a pool of 206 
because they said they had heard or read some of Poindexter's 1987 
congressional testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen of the first 21 in the pool were women. Jury selection is to continue 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The judge approved for the jury pool a real-estate lawyer who worked in 
President Bush's campaign as part of a group doing background reviews of 
potential vice presidential candidates. Bush was President Ronald Reagan's vice 
president at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter's lawyers are expected to replay Reagan's videotaped testimony in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those questioned said they knew little about the Iran-Contra affair. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the charges against Poindexter could carry a maximum five-year prison 
term and $250,000 fine on conviction.

CHANNEL ONE, CLASSROOM TELEVISION WITH COMMERCIALS, GOES ON THE AIR

Students across the country got the news Monday along with a sales pitch for 
candy, razors and cheese snacks when the advertiser-supported classroom program 
Channel One went on the air. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is a good idea," said Powell High School student Jim Addington, 17, 
one of the first to see the Channel One news program, beamed nationwide for the 
first time to 400 schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see why there is so much controversy over the commercials," he said, 
because he has seen the same commercials for M&amp;Ms, Gillette shavers and 
Chee-tos on regular television at home. 
</P>
<P>
The brief program is produced by the Knoxville-based media company Whittle 
Communications, which loans participating schools expensive video equipment and 
satellite dishes to receive the program, and sells advertising to cover the 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
Despite criticism from national education groups, bans by public educators in 
New York and California and a lawsuit in North Carolina, 2,900 schools in 34 
states have signed up for Channel One, company Chairman Christopher Whittle 
told reporters at the high school. 
</P>
<P>
As long as they're taking Channel One, schools can use the TV sets, video 
recorders and satellite for other projects, as well. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's broadcast by Channel One's five-member team of under-30 anchors and 
reporters gave a capsule of breaking news -- voting in three Soviet republics, 
last week's escape of a 17-year-old Cuban to the United States on a sail board, 
the return of the space shuttle Atlantis and President Bush's trade talks with 
the Japanese prime minister.

350 AT RALLY ACCUSE RANDOM HOUSE OF KILLING SUBSIDIARY

<P>
About 350 authors, editors, literary agents and sympathizers staged a noisy 
sidewalk protest Monday to accuse Random House of destroying one of its key 
subsidiaries for financial reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is not the last word," read one sign displayed outside the 
publishing giant's mid-town headquarters, where a lunchtime crowd had to thread 
its way past police barricades. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters charged that Random House owner Samuel I. Newhouse had 
effectively killed the subsidiary, Pantheon Books, by forcing the resignation 
Wednesday of its longtime editorial director, Andre Schiffrin. 
</P>
<P>
Schiffrin reportedly had refused to cut his staff and the number of books he 
planned to publish. 
</P>
<P>
Five of Pantheon's six senior editors subsequently quit, saying Pantheon's 
established role as a publishing house for unconventional and otherwise 
little-known writers was being ruined in the name of profits. 
</P>
<P>
Random House chairman Alberto Vitale said he was "absolutely puzzled" by the 
reaction to Schiffrin's resignation. He said Pantheon would have ceased to 
operate "a long, long time ago" without Random House's support. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not Random House who is hurting anything," Vitale said in a telephone 
interview.

CENTER THEATRE GROUP WINS 12 CRITICS AWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Center Theatre Group is the big winner of the 21st annual Los Angeles Drama 
Critics Circle awards being announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Center Theatre Group, which captured 12 of the 30 awards given for outstanding 
achievement in theater in 1989, staged a remarkable comeback from last year, 
when the Music Center's resident companies received only one award. 
</P>
<P>
It won five awards for the Mark Taper Forum's "Stand-Up Tragedy" -- the most 
for any single production -- including an outstanding production honor. Center 
Theatre Group also won seven awards for three other shows: four for "The 
Phantom of the Opera" and two for "Into the Woods," both at the Ahmanson 
Theatre, and one for John Lithgow's performance in "Who's Afraid of Virginia 
Woolf?," which was part of the Ahmanson's season at the Doolittle Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
The only other award for outstanding production this year went to "Cloud Nine," 
which was presented at the 99-seat West Coast Ensemble. It received a total of 
three awards. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, shows in major theaters received 22 out of the 30 awards given, 
while shows in smaller theaters netted seven. The 30th went to Raymond J. Barry 
for his lead performance in "Once in Doubt," which played both at the small 
Cast-at-the-Circle Theatre and the larger Los Angeles Theatre Center. 
</P>
<P>
Including "Once in Doubt," three LATC shows earned a single award apiece, and 
two South Coast Repertory productions garnered a total of four awards -- three 
of them for "You Never Can Tell." Besides "Into the Woods," other productions 
with two award winners were "Driving Miss Daisy," "Wenceslas Square" and 
"Gypsy."

FEDERAL FUNDING OF CONTROVERSIAL ART DEFENDED; 
</P>
<P>
ART: 'CREATIVITY WILL BE THE CURRENCY OF THE 21ST CENTURY,' NEA CHIEF 
FROHNMAYER DECLARES AT HOUSE SUBCOMMITTTEE HEARING IN MALIBU'S GETTY MUSEUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Declaring that "creativity will be the currency of the 21st Century," the 
chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts said Monday it is appropriate 
for the federal government to fund potentially offensive artworks. 
</P>
<P>
John E. Frohnmayer, the NEA chairman, made the remarks before a hearing 
conducted by the postsecondary education subcommittee of the House Education 
and Labor Committee. The subcommittee will originate a bill this year to extend 
the arts endowment's legislative life for another five years. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing -- the first of a series scheduled in the House and Senate this 
year on bills to renew the NEA's legislative mandate -- was held at the J. Paul 
Getty Museum in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer's personal affirmation of federal funding for artworks that may be 
perceived by some as offensive came in response to a question by Rep. Pat 
Williams (D-Mont.), the subcommittee chairman. The remark appeared to coincide 
with an effort by Frohnmayer to begin making a public stand against attempts by 
conservatives in Congress to force the NEA to employ standards specifying 
appropriate subject matter and artistic approach for federally funded creative 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
"Every society needs its artists; they are its watchers, its critics, its 
champions," Frohnmayer said in his testimony. "It is a commentary on the 
strength and wisdom of a government which supports the arts without content 
restraints." 
</P>
<P>
Endowment observers said Frohnmayer's testimony appeared to signal a 
strengthening of the NEA chairman's resolve to publicly battle challenges to 
the NEA's artistic independence. It came at a hearing punctuated by 
demonstrations outside the hearing room on behalf of both arts advocates who 
oppose clamping restrictions on art the NEA can support and conservative 
demonstrators demanding that it be required to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Artists and supporters of the agency clashed with a group opposed to federal 
arts support. Outside the hearing, during a press conference by a group calling 
itself Taxpayers for Accountability for Government (TAG), artists and 
supporters shouted down conservatives holding the press conference as they 
tried to read prepared statements. 
</P>
<P>
JoEllen Allen, president of Eagle Forum, a national group that advocates 
traditional values, said the organization supports elimination of the NEA. 
"Eliminating federal funding of the NEA would save taxpayers over $171 million 
in 1990 and end the escalating controversy concerning whether guidelines should 
be established for federally subsidized art." 
</P>
<P>
Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, chairman of the Traditional Values Coalition and one of 
the organizers of the new TAG group, complained that the format of the hearing 
excluded NEA opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Blair, who identified himself as an independent Christian, said, "I have 
never been so deeply offended as I am" by the thought of an NEA-supported 
photograph of a crucifix immersed in urine that became one of the rallying 
points of heated debate last year over funding for the arts agency. But as 
Blair spoke, artists demonstrating nearby nearly drowned out the conservative 
speakers with chants of "Shame! Shame!" and "Art is not a crime." 
</P>
<P>
Conservative demonstrators, carrying picket signs denouncing "obscene" art, 
clashed visually with artists staging an advocacy demonstration with the same 
signs many carried last week in a march on the downtown Los Angeles Federal 
Building at which 27 artists and arts supporters were arrested. The march was 
the first of several public events in Southern California in the last few days 
that underscored the volatility of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Early Monday morning, arts supporters suspended banners supporting artistic 
freedom from freeway overpasses as far south as downtown Santa Monica. "Stop 
Censorship Now" signs were stapled to telephone poles along several miles of 
Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Getty Museum director John Walsh, who is also president of the Assn. of Art 
Museum Directors, a national group representing the nation's largest museums, 
urged the Williams subcommittee to ward off an attack by a small group of 
legislators, saying that the chilling of free expression initiated by any 
clampdown on content of publicly supported art is "a price too high for a free 
society to pay." 
</P>
<P>
The audience, which remained orderly throughout the hearing, included a broad 
variety of people, from Sheldon to Los Angeles video artist Sheree Rose and 
comedian Bob Flanagan. Rose and Flanagan, who work together, were among nine 
West Coast artists named in a letter to the NEA from Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) 
late last year that demanded information on endowment support of specific arts 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
Artist organizations and individual artists named in the Helms letter have 
contended the conservative senator's correspondence was intended to intimidate 
artists working in controversial media and subject matter. Rose and Flanagan's 
work focuses on sadomasochism and visually depicts such practices as piercing 
of the genital organs. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's hearing, Frohnmayer noted that the NEA has undergone legislative 
reauthorization six times before during its 25-year history. On each occasion, 
Frohnmayer noted, a debate of some sort has materialized over whether the 
government should restrict the kinds of artworks that may be paid for with 
federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer recalled that when the arts endowment was created in 1965, 
legislators underscored a series of fears that it might become the equivalent 
of the ministries of culture in communist countries -- forcing the content of 
art to conform to political dictates. 
</P>
<P>
"For 25 years this agency has not fulfilled that dire warning," Frohnmayer 
said. "And it should not do so now. The heart and soul of the arts is 
creativity, and promotion of that creativity is as old as our government 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer also introduced a key element of his reauthorization strategy, in 
which the NEA is to refrain from trading body blows with conservative opponents 
who attempt to focus the debate on artworks of questionable taste the endowment 
may have supported. Under Frohnmayer's strategy, emphasis is to be maintained 
on quality examples of artistic excellence from among the 85,000 grants the 
agency has given. 
</P>
<P>
Other endowment officials acknowledged that the strategy is not without risk. 
Alvin S. Felzenberg, the NEA's senior deputy chairman, said, "I hope he's 
right" of Frohnmayer's decision to focus on positive examples of NEA support 
and essentially ignore the conservative drumbeat. In a press conference of his 
own after the hearing, Williams repeated a warning he gave to arts supporters 
last year: That the vociferousness of the conservative protest may make it 
nearly impossible to produce an NEA re-authorization bill this year completely 
free of content controls. 
</P>
<P>
But Felzenberg acknowledged that the situation remains risky for the NEA. "The 
debate (should be) over whether the NEA shall receive another renewal of its 
legislative life (based on its established record of artistic excellence). 
</P>
<P>
"If both sides focus on that debate, the chairman's optimism is well founded," 
he said. "If people do not focus on that debate, we may come out of it a little 
differently poised (in terms of being forced to impose content controls) than 
when we went in." 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's hearing, Norman Cousins, the prominent former magazine editor who 
is now an assistant dean of the UCLA School of Medicine, argued that "the 
greatest danger we face is to think that anyone knows enough to tell an artist 
what to paint or an author what to write. It is the shortest of all steps from 
telling writers what not to write or a painter what not to paint to telling a 
citizen what not to think or to think." 
</P>
<P>
Judith Baca, an internationally known Los Angeles muralist, urged the House 
subcommittee to not simply renew the legal life of the NEA but to double the 
arts agency's budget at the same time. "The United States should be the leader 
in the free market of ideas," Baca said, "and remember that an idea with which 
the majority of people do not agree could foster the greatest creativity in 
others."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: THE BOTTOM LINE ON ROONEY'S RETURN TO '60 MINUTES'; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: CBS CUTS SHORT SUSPENSION OF CONTROVERSIAL COMMENTATOR AFTER 
RATINGS GO DOWN. BUT IT'S JUST ANOTHER EPISODE IN A NETWORK FIASCO. 
</P>

<P>
Someone should do a gene check at CBS. 
</P>
<P>
It's obvious there's been extensive watering down. No other explanation is 
possible for the shockingly vacuous, hypocritical and ultimately cynical role 
of CBS executives in the Andy Rooney fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
What jerks. 
</P>
<P>
This is supposed to play? CBS suspends Rooney for three months for being an 
alleged racist or gay basher or both or none of the above? But he is reinstated 
more than two months early because, as CBS News President David Burke says, "It 
is time Andy Rooney returned to his proper place on "60 Minutes"? 
</P>
<P>
Come again? 
</P>
<P>
For a man whose business is communications, Burke has been incredibly 
uncommunicative, retreating behind a thick smoke screen of evasive platitudes 
and unfathomable generalities. Who's writing his public statements these days, 
Prof. Irwin Corey? 
</P>
<P>
If CBS thinks Rooney wasn't guilty as implied, why was he suspended in the 
first place? But if CBS thinks he was guilty, then why was he brought back so 
soon? 
</P>
<P>
He received time off for good behavior? He'd been reborn? Rehabilitated? Oh 
stop it. The Rooney affair proves that CBS needs an integrity check too. 
</P>
<P>
Setting aside the alleged racism and homophobia for the moment, everyone 
familiar with the driving motivation behind commercial television knows exactly 
why Rooney was allowed to return to "60 Minutes" Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Ratings. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney's suspension came after disparaging remarks about homosexuals and blacks 
were attributed to him in a Los Angeles-based gay publication, The Advocate. He 
acknowledged having made the comments about homosexuals in a letter but denied 
saying that blacks had "watered down" their genes through excessive 
reproduction by those who were least intelligent. 
</P>
<P>
CBS didn't publicly defend Rooney. CBS didn't publicly attack Rooney. CBS just 
suspended him. 
</P>
<P>
It would be nice to report that CBS had returned Rooney to the air when it did 
merely because it decided it had wronged him, a reason you could respect. But 
the absence of a CBS apology to Rooney, coupled with the timing of his return 
-- on the crest of a backlash against CBS -- scream otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Public response to Rooney's suspension had been overwhelmingly negative, and 
that -- combined with some recent ratings slippage by the usually dominant "60 
Minutes" -- delivered a message that those arbiters of ethics at CBS obviously 
felt they could not ignore. 
</P>
<P>
The moral judgment that CBS seemed to have made against Rooney by innuendo -- 
one it never articulated -- swiftly passed into oblivion. It wouldn't have made 
any difference had Rooney been an ax murderer. The call of the buck echoed 
resoundingly and emphatically. This sucker was coming back. 
</P>
<P>
Now instead of quarantining him like a leper, CBS embraced him like a returning 
Nelson Mandela, cynically seeking to exploit the Rooney controversy to its own 
advantage by basking in its neon glow. And if a resurfacing Rooney could help 
"60 Minutes" have an especially big Sunday (it attracted a robust 36% of the TV 
sets in use Sunday, according to Nielsen ratings for the nation's 23 largest 
markets), perhaps that would boost that night's entire CBS schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The following was typical of the promos that CBS ran Sunday advertising the 
return of Rooney: "Yes, he's coming back tonight, Andy Rooney, on '60 
Minutes'!" 
</P>
<P>
And here was Jim Lampley at the top of the 6 p.m. news on CBS-owned KCBS 
Channel 2: "Andy Rooney spends a few minutes defending himself on '60 Minutes,' 
and we'll have a preview of his remarks." Following additional strategic teases 
of this preview, it finally arrived nearer the end of the hour, with Bree 
Walker giving a brief summation of Rooney's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
CBS may ultimately see the Rooney debacle as a prototype for escaping its 
low-ratings ghetto. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Rather is slipping? Have him insult the homeless, then suspend him without 
explanation, have him serve a few meals at a shelter and bring him back a week 
later with a ticker tape parade. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Sajak and Connie Chung can't get arrested? Have them publicly insult Andy 
Rooney, then pull them off the air for exercising free speech and wait for the 
angry backlash from civil libertarians. 
</P>
<P>
After all, it does appear to be the self-serving position of CBS, as Mike 
Wallace put it on "60 Minutes" Sunday, that "all's well that ends well." 
Earlier in the week, Burke said "we have all learned a great deal" about "how 
deeply people and groups can be hurt if great care is not taken in public 
discourse." 
</P>
<P>
Just how much CBS has "learned" remains in doubt, however, for in announcing 
Rooney's return, "CBS This Morning" reported Friday that he had been suspended 
"after derogatory comments against blacks were attributed to him." 
</P>
<P>
No mention was made of the remarks he admitted making about gays, remarks far 
more derogatory to them than the refuted quote about "watered down" genes was 
to blacks. This is the new CBS sensitivity? 
</P>
<P>
Despite his attempts at humor, Rooney was sort of a sad figure when he returned 
at the end of "60 Minutes" Sunday. He was right -- he shouldn't have had to 
defend his record as a non-racist and supporter of black rights. 
</P>
<P>
However, his words Sunday about gays sounded more than a bit insincere. 
</P>
<P>
He hadn't realized what he had said about gays "would hurt them"? He perhaps 
thought they would applaud his comments in a CBS special last year that lumped 
"homosexual unions" with cigarettes, alcohol and other "self-induced ills" that 
often lead to early death? He thought he was being complimentary in writing The 
Advocate that homosexuality was "ethically or morally wrong and abnormal 
behavior"? 
</P>
<P>
With freedom of thought and expression comes the freedom to be thick. 
</P>
<P>
In another example of that Sunday, Rooney recalled the time he kicked someone 
out of his home for repeatedly saying "nigger." Admirable. But then he added: 
"I'd feel the same today if someone used an insulting word about homosexuals." 
After what he's said about homosexuals? Go on, get outta here, you big palooka. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, life at CBS goes on, with Rooney on Sunday asking the only question 
that really mattered in this muddy episode: "What do I do to justify the action 
David Burke . . . has taken in putting me back on the air?" 
</P>
<P>
Get ratings, Andy. Get ratings.

TAX REVOLT 1990: HELLO GRIDLOCK;

VOTER-APPROVED LIMITS HAVE KEPT STATE SPENDING DOWN BUT ERODED BASIC SERVICES.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Consider this bleak scenario. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies are laid off in the face of rising crime. Decrepit freeways 
endanger motorists, while new highway construction comes to a standstill. 
Hundreds of mentally ill patients wander the streets for lack of care. 
</P>
<P>
Prisoners riot in overcrowded cells while others are released before serving 
full terms because there is no place to put them. And students cram into 
classrooms as the backlog for new school construction reaches $5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
A futuristic nightmare? Unfortunately, it's already here. 
</P>
<P>
Each of these problems has been experienced somewhere in California in recent 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Just about everyone agrees that California government is in trouble. And most 
point to the same problem: voter-approved tax and spending limits that have 
stripped the governor and Legislature of much of their flexibility in running 
state government. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing is done, state officeholders say, the problems will get even worse. 
Many are pinning their hopes on a June 5 ballot measure that would authorize a 
9-cents-per gallon gasoline tax increase, raise the voter-passed spending limit 
and allow the state to spend roughly $1 billion more than it can now. 
</P>
<P>
"If it fails, we are in deep trouble," said Assemblyman John Vasconcellos 
(D-Santa Clara), chairman of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee. "We are in 
trouble with it. Without it, we are in a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Government programs, spurred by legal and political pressures, are growing 
faster than the money needed to pay for them -- and have been for several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian, in releasing his new $53.7-billion budget in January, 
said the budget process -- the mechanism that millions of Californians rely on 
for government services -- "is in need of serious structural repair." 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the problem are the tax limits, approved by voters in 1978 with 
Proposition 13, and the Gann spending limit, which followed the next year. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the problems Deukmejian and the Legislature face in raising the 
gasoline tax. 
</P>
<P>
Just about everyone in the Capitol supports the gas tax proposal on the June 
ballot to finance highway building projects. Without the new money, California 
Department of Transportation officials have warned that the state's highway 
construction program faces "extensive delays." Approval of new building 
projects would be pushed back years. 
</P>
<P>
To put the transportation problem in perspective, consider that 45 million more 
vehicles are using California roads and highways than when Deukmejian took 
office in 1983. But ongoing budget problems have resulted in fewer highway-lane 
miles being built during Deukmejian's first five years than were built during 
ex-Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr.'s last five years -- and Brown was sharply 
criticized for not building enough freeways. 
</P>
<P>
So, why not just raise the gasoline tax and take care of highway business? 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that the state is only $143 million under its maximum spending 
limit for the 1990-91 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The June ballot measure -- which also includes increases in highway user fees 
-- would raise, on average, $1.5 billion a year. Thus, the spending limit has 
to be raised so all that new money can be spent. 
</P>
<P>
But that, in turn, jeopardizes the gains teachers and schools made with 
Proposition 98, which mandates that schools receive 40% of general purpose tax 
revenues as well as the lion's share of surplus money over and above the 
spending limit. 
</P>
<P>
So what resulted was a politically risky gasoline tax measure based on a 
complicated revision of the spending limit that also retools Proposition 98. 
Some supporters of the measure believe it may be defeated because it is so 
sweeping and complex. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the current problem over money stems from differences between the 
Democratic-controlled Legislature and Deukmejian over the steps necessary to 
correct what the governor calls the built-in "structural problem." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian wants to suspend automatic inflation increases in payments to 
welfare recipients, and built-in budget increases for health and welfare 
programs. He would also like to suspend some of the provisions of the school 
funding measure, Proposition 98. The problem, he believes, lies not in the 
amount of money coming in to the state, but the lack of flexibility he has in 
spending it. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats, on the other hand, stoutly defend health, welfare and education 
programs and have successfully fought off Deukmejian's proposals. They believe 
the state simply does not have enough money to meet its various needs. Many 
Democrats would like to eliminate the provisions of Proposition 13 that make it 
harder to raise taxes and do away with the spending limit altogether. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides have fought to a standstill for the last seven years. They are in 
basic agreement, at least for now, in their support for the proposed 
constitutional amendment, which will appear on the June ballot as Proposition 
111. 
</P>
<P>
Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a long-term observer of state government and senior 
associate of the Center for Politics and Policy at the Claremont Graduate 
School, calls the gasoline tax measure "Tinker-toy policy-making." 
</P>
<P>
She said the compromises that went into the proposed constitutional measure are 
themselves indicative of another major contributor to the current situation: 
the lack of strong political leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"Policy gridlock is choking the state," she said. "Politicians are loathe to 
take an unpopular, though necessary, stand and risk their job. Someone has to 
say, 'Yes, we are going to have to spend more money. Yes, we are going to have 
to raise taxes.' " 
</P>
<P>
The gas tax would help solve transportation problems -- but state lawmakers 
expect to continue to be plagued by money shortages for health, welfare, 
school, prison and other programs even if the June ballot measure passes. 
</P>
<P>
Vasconcellos, the Ways and Means chairman, said the Gann limit should have been 
changed several years ago when the state first seriously began to experience 
budget problems. 
</P>
<P>
"It's coming awfully late," he said. "We are $180 million short of what it 
would take just to bring the mental health system back to the service level we 
were able to provide eight years ago. Other programs are in just as bad shape." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the unprecedented prison construction program under way in California 
in recent years, overcrowding still plagues the system and state prisons are 
operating at more than 170% of their design capacity. 
</P>
<P>
The Deukmejian Administration already has completed 14 major prison 
construction projects. Four prisons are under construction, and three others 
are being designed. Even so, the state is losing ground. After the new projects 
are completed, by mid-1994 the overcrowding problem will be even worse than it 
is today. 
</P>
<P>
And Sen. Alfred E. Alquist (D-San Jose), chairman of the Senate Budget and 
Fiscal Review Committee, complains that spending on prisons is siphoning money 
from other state programs. Between the 1984-85 and 1990-91 budget years, 
spending grew by 128% for the Department of Corrections, when adjusted for 
inflation, but less than 1% for the Department of Aging and 45.6% for local 
mental health programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Demographic trends -- the mini-baby boom and the rising number of Californians 
in their 70s and 80s -- mean the demand for classrooms and long-term nursing 
care will continue to rise faster than revenues," Alquist said. 
</P>
<P>
Public schools, despite the funding guarantees of Proposition 98 and lottery 
revenues, will continue to play catch-up. Even though Deukmejian is proposing 
to put two school construction bond measures on the ballot this year totaling 
$1.6 billion, officials say schools need between $3.5 billion and $5 billion to 
meet their needs. 
</P>
<P>
State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig said schools are still fighting to 
overcome the erosion in programs caused by inflation and budget reductions 
dating back to the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"We are so far behind the rest of the country that we have a long way to go," 
said Honig, who expects school enrollments during the next academic year to 
rise by 160,000 students statewide, a huge surge complicated by the special 
needs of the new pupils. Schools, in addition to supplying traditional academic 
curriculums, must provide language and other special courses to immigrants, 
deal with drug problems and meet mental health needs of students that the state 
can no longer provide. 
</P>
<P>
Local governments are faring even worse. 
</P>
<P>
When Proposition 13 passed in 1978, the state had a budget surplus of $3.7 
billion -- roughly 19% of its overall budget -- and this cushion was used to 
soften the financial pinch on local government. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 13 cost local governments $7 billion in lost revenues its first 
year. It took seven years for property tax money to get back to the level where 
it stood before the initiative passed. Counties are still trying to make up for 
the losses experienced during those years and are further hamstrung by 
Proposition 13's provisions against raising new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
A study by the County Supervisors Assn. in 1986 found that half of California's 
58 counties were "in serious financial trouble and faced drastic program cuts 
and employee layoffs." Things are much the same today, county officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Larry E. Naake, executive director of the county supervisors association, said: 
"From 1981 to 1986, the growth of county costs for jails, courts, welfare and 
other programs increased by about 150%. During that same period, taxes, fees 
and fines produced an increase of 48% in revenues. That gap just continues to 
widen." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, five community mental health clinics closed during 1989 
and service reductions have been ordered in seven others. The county's jail 
system is bursting at the seams. In a scenario played out in numerous other 
counties, prisoners are being released before their terms are up because of 
overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
Butte County, north of Sacramento, almost went broke last year. Only a 
last-minute state bailout saved the county. As it was, the county has put its 
library system in mothballs, closing all branch offices and is laying off 
nearly all its librarians. The size of the sheriff's patrol was reduced by 
about one-third, and 14 probation officers were laid off or lost through 
attrition, leaving only three probation officers now on the job. 
</P>
<P>
In Contra Costa County, social workers walked off their jobs for a day several 
months ago, saying that budget cuts have left them stretched so thin that they 
are being overwhelmed by their individual caseloads. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara County Executive Sally Reed said huge caseloads are overwhelming 
social workers just about everywhere. "Our probation officers serve from 300 to 
1,000 clients or more. That is not an acceptable situation for us. We have long 
waiting lines for drug abuse and other programs. In areas of alcohol services, 
mental health, drug abuse and the public administrator-guardian, we do the 
absolute bare minimum we need to survive." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Mental Health Director Tim Mullens said the county is forced to 
restrict its mental health programs to "acute" cases, meaning only the most 
seriously ill are treated, which is often too late to head off a problem. "I 
don't even pretend to be in the business of prevention," Mullens said. 
</P>
<P>
Comparatively, cities are much better off. Even so, Keith Comrie, Los Angeles 
chief administrative officer, said the city still has not fully recovered from 
budget cuts that began with Proposition 13. He estimates that the city has a 
$1-billion backlog of street repairs. He said even though the Police Department 
has grown, Los Angeles is still below the national average for the number of 
officers per capita. "Some cities back East have twice the number of officers 
we have," Comrie said. 
</P>
<P>
The League of California Cities concluded in a study published in August that 
"10 years after the passage of Proposition 13, cities have not returned to 
their pre-Proposition 13 funding levels. Decreased federal aid, growing 
populations, rising expenditures, and greater limits on cities' revenue-raising 
authority have all contributed to sagging revenues." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, in the new budget he released Jan. 10, called for further cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Counties face a $150-million cut in a state bailout program they had been 
counting on to shore up health programs and head off further cuts in mental 
health, clinic and hospital services. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian also proposed knocking some 45,000 people off a highly respected 
program aimed at steering the elderly and frail away from institutionalization 
by providing in-home housekeeping and other support services. 
</P>
<P>
The budget also would trim $91.6 million from a job-training program for 
welfare recipients, halting training to about 164,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
On top of that, legally required health and welfare benefit increases would be 
frozen for nearly 3 million poor families, senior citizens, and blind and 
disabled people. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous other cuts were proposed for children's, family and other human 
service programs. 
</P>
<P>
Even elementary and high schools, supposed to be protected by Proposition 98, 
the 1988 voter-approved initiative that guarantees public schools and community 
colleges funding, face a cut in spending per pupil when grants are adjusted for 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
As for the state, it has scrambled for dollars and been forced to use 
bond-financing to borrow record amounts of money. 
</P>
<P>
State borrowing has increased dramatically since 1978. Bonds have become 
increasingly attractive to lawmakers because money from bond sales is not 
counted against the spending limit and voters do not have the same distaste for 
them as they do for tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
During 1978, voters approved $875 million in general obligation bonds, or bonds 
that are paid off from general purpose tax revenues (the same pot of money used 
to finance schools, health, welfare and other state programs). Last year, 
voters approved $5.5 billion in general obligation bonds. Although state 
officials say that California is still a low-debt state when compared to 
others, principal and interest payments will jump from $645 million this year 
to $832 million next year. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, fees are being relied on more heavily. Average fees at the University 
of California, which can vary from campus to campus, have soared from $706 for 
the 1977-78 school year to a proposed $1,703 for the 1990-91 year. There were 
comparable increases in the California State University system. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there is a flip side to all this. 
</P>
<P>
Californians' tax burden is much lighter than it was before 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 13 produced big property tax savings, roughly $7 billion the first 
year. On top of that, the Legislature got caught up in what it viewed as the 
taxpayer revolt and passed a series of major cuts in taxes on businesses and 
individuals. The legislative analyst's office estimates that tax cuts since 
June 6, 1978, the day Proposition 13 was approved, collectively have saved 
state taxpayers $178.7 billion in state and local taxes. 
</P>
<P>
According to the state Department of Finance, in 1977 California's state and 
local taxes were among the highest in the nation. Last year, California ranked 
17th among the states. 
</P>
<P>
Many view 1990 as a make-or-break year. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman William P. Baker of Danville, the Republican vice chairman of the 
Ways and Means Committee, believes that if the June ballot measure lifting the 
spending limit fails, state officeholders will just have to learn to live with 
chronic budget problems. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's turned down, it will be a good long time before folks up here will 
attempt to adjust the Gann Limit or raise the gas tax," he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
But Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, a Democratic candidate for governor this 
year, believes the Legislature will have no choice but to come back with 
another ballot measure in November. "The state just has too many unmet needs," 
he said. "We are not going to be able to keep up with the things we have to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Even some stout defenders of the tax revolt measures are in a mood to consider 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Fox, a spokesman for Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn., named after the 
co-author of Proposition 13, said he could support putting additional 
flexibility in the limit, but not repealing it outright. 
</P>
<P>
"The limit does a good job of putting some restraint on government," Fox said. 
"Government was growing much faster than even people's personal income the last 
20 years. Government is not going to constrain itself. Something has to."

LA WEEKLY'S ADOLESCENCE PROVES A TROUBLING ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK CLIFFORD, TIMES URBAN AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The tabloid's first edition was tame enough. There was a feature on female 
comedians, a sympathetic item on Sid Vicious, the late rock 'n' roller, and a 
chuckle over the first U.S. Marine to have a sex change operation. A decade 
later, the newspaper was accusing George Bush of adultery and alleging State 
Department collaboration with cocaine smugglers in Central America. 
</P>
<P>
The LA Weekly, born 12 years ago in a rented bungalow on Sunset Boulevard and 
today worth an estimated $20 million, has developed into one of the nation's 
most successful and provocative alternative newspapers. Nonetheless, it now 
finds itself in a troubled adolescence -- embarrassed by some of its excesses, 
uncertain about its future. 
</P>
<P>
Despite revenues in excess of $7 million, the Weekly lost money last year, the 
first time that has happened since the paper's infancy. The Weekly recently 
lost the first round of a multimillion-dollar lawsuit with a former printer. 
And the paper's free-lance writers, no longer satisfied with 20 cents a word, 
are demanding a raise. 
</P>
<P>
Against that background, the Weekly's editors are trying to fashion an 
up-to-date image for a paper that came into being when Melrose Avenue kitsch, 
punk rock and the Sandinistas were reigning icons of Los Angeles cultural life. 
The editors face a dilemma common to alternative urban newspapers that 
blossomed in the 1960s and 1970s: While they want to retain the nervy, 
adversarial style that distinguishes the Weekly from the mainstream press, a 
desire to be financially stable and politically influential is breeding an air 
of caution. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the Weekly's audience has grown older, wealthier and, if not 
more conservative, at least more circumspect. The city has also changed, shed 
some of its tinsel, and the Weekly clearly wants to be a fixture of the 
contemporary landscape. 
</P>
<P>
"The city has never taken itself so seriously," Weekly Editor Kit Rachlis said. 
"Crime, pollution, immigration, growth. Is Los Angeles world class or Third 
World? It's all part of the debate the city is busy having with itself today. 
We want to be part of the debate." 
</P>
<P>
It certainly has enough sheer bulk to be noticed. Once a wispy tabloid, the 
free-distribution newspaper now swells to 200 pages with ads for gyms, tanning 
parlors, hair restorers, facial toners, love brokers (976-CUDLE), holistic 
dentists, colon hydrotherapists, designer clothes and a seemingly endless 
inventory of futons. The paper distributes 165,000 issues each week and claims 
that its readership exceeds 400,000. 
</P>
<P>
Deciphering its vision is another matter. The paper's mood swings are apparent 
from week to week. 
</P>
<P>
One 1989 cover story offered a breathless portrait of NWA, the Compton rap 
group accused by the FBI of encouraging violence against the police. An issue 
of the Weekly devoted to health care fired a blunderbuss shot at the medical 
profession: "Doctors are killing us because they want to die rich," the lead 
story snarled. 
</P>
<P>
On other occasions, the Weekly has practiced a more genteel journalism -- 
providing a dispassionate portrait of City Councilman Michael Woo and an 
exhaustive history of the Catholic Church in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
This pattern of zig-zagging to the cultural fringe and back resumed this year 
when a 3,000-word story on "The Witches Next Door" was soon followed by an 
equally lengthy critique of the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the Weekly's longtime contributors say they don't like what is going on 
at the paper. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't broken with them, but I find it difficult to reconcile myself to a 
paper that puts a story about witches on its cover," said Marc Cooper, who has 
written about Central America and served as the Weekly's media critic. "Those 
of us who have written for it over a long period of time don't quite fathom 
where the Weekly is. The focus is more confused than ever before." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Weekly has always been a mixed bag of radical ranting, New Age bromides 
and sleazy classifieds side-by-side with thoughtful movie reviews, 
investigative reporting and imaginative feature writing -- all of it anchored 
by a guide to theaters, restaurants and nightclubs that is the most 
comprehensive of its kind in town. 
</P>
<P>
And a fundamental contradiction has long been apparent. The paper is shot 
through with anti-capitalistic rhetoric, blaming U.S. corporations for most of 
the world's ills. Its executive editor, Harold Meyerson, is an official of the 
Democratic Socialists of America. Meanwhile, the paper is fueled by its own 
robust capitalist engine that generates several million dollars a year in ads, 
many of them celebrating the good life on the city's fashionable Westside. 
</P>
<P>
"The Weekly has the image of a newspaper that encouraged you to write angry 
letters to Ronald Reagan while you are getting a suntan in a sun-tan parlor," 
joked Jay Levin, the newspaper's founder and first editor. 
</P>
<P>
The ingrained paradoxes are not lost on the Weekly's readers. "The Weekly is 
chic materialism couched between chic anti-materialism," said Jim Wisely, a 
state Democratic political operative. Like a lot of Westsiders, Wisely is as 
much a user of the Weekly's ads and services as he is a reader of its articles. 
</P>
<P>
"If I want to get my car detailed or buy a halogen lamp or show an out-of-town 
friend all the hot spots, I look in the Weekly. It deals with the world of 
wants rather than needs." 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper recently attracted the attention of Forbes magazine, which touted 
the newspaper's success at dishing up "liberal politics to L.A. yuppies." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles has forced the Weekly to differ from other mainstays of the 
alternative press, such as the Village Voice in New York, the Boston Phoenix or 
San Francisco's Bay Guardian. Historically, those papers have drawn their 
readers from definable bohemian communities -- affordable enclaves of artists, 
writers and academicians where people's bank accounts, as well as their 
politics, are of more proletarian dimensions. 
</P>
<P>
Success-driven, style-conscious Los Angeles has never cultivated a bohemian 
quarter. Places that might have qualified, Venice or Silver Lake, quickly 
became too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Weekly found an audience. The spine of its circulation runs 
along Sunset Boulevard from near downtown to the coast. It is distributed east 
and west from Wilshire Boulevard to the Hollywood Hills. About 60,000 papers go 
to the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"Our audience is overwhelmingly Baby Boomers with money to spend," said Derek 
Shearer, a professor of public policy at Occidental College and a member of the 
Weekly's board of directors. "Our readers are people who can afford to go 
movies and theaters, listen to National Public Radio and think Oliver Stone is 
a great film maker." 
</P>
<P>
Here is how the Weekly describes its audience in a brochure to advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
"Weekly readers like to buy, buy, buy. . . . They want Perrier instead of 
water; croissants instead of toast; Rolex instead of Timex. They earn champagne 
incomes to match their champagne tastes." 
</P>
<P>
According to the brochure, the Weekly's readers spend $17 million on clothes 
each month and consume over a million bottles of wine. Seventy-four percent 
dine out at least every other night and 68% travel abroad at least once a year. 
The statistics were compiled for the Weekly by a local marketing company. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Catone, a display advertising manager for the Los Angeles Times, said the 
Weekly has been "a formidable competitor" for ads from Westside businesses. The 
Weekly has been more than a match for other alternative papers. 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1970s, the Weekly got a run for its money from the Reader, a 
Westside weekly modeled after the highly successful Chicago Reader. 
</P>
<P>
The Reader survives today, but its original publisher, Bob Roth, concedes that 
the Weekly has had a better grasp of the L.A. audience. 
</P>
<P>
"Our front page story would be a slice-of-life piece about a fisherman who 
worked a two-man boat out in the ocean for 10 days at a time," Roth said. "The 
Weekly would have a cover on roller disco. They plugged in very well to the 
insubstantial vision of L.A. as Tinseltown. We were trying to make it out to be 
a real city of factory workers, fishermen and regular people." 
</P>
<P>
While both papers struggled in the beginning, Roth said, the Weekly gave off a 
Southern California glow that conveyed the illusion of prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever your politics, in L.A., you have to look successful," Roth said. 
"That's the key, and right away, the Weekly was looking big and brassy. They 
had so many ads in the beginning, I was convinced they were giving them away." 
</P>
<P>
David Cohen, who was in charge of advertising at the Weekly during the early 
days, said the paper would cut its ad rates by 20% to 30% in order to lock up 
advertisers that might be tempted to go to the Reader. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the Weekly has been especially eager to find fault with the 
mainstream press. But under Rachlis, the new editor, the paper seems willing to 
fess up to a lapse or two of its own. For example, there was the adult fashion 
issue that featured a 12-year-old cover girl. "People here tried to say they 
didn't know she was 12 years old. They knew," said Rachlis, who was not working 
for the Weekly when the issue came out. 
</P>
<P>
When he became editor in late 1988, said Rachlis, he was disturbed to find that 
restaurant reviewers were under orders not to pan restaurants that advertised 
in the Weekly. He said he lifted the order. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, actor Michael Douglas, a member of the Weekly's board of 
directors and one of its original financial backers, said recently that the 
paper has panned every one of his movies. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the media mainstream, the Weekly has struggled for recognition for its 
journalistic successes. Writers talk about hiring publicists to get serious 
stories on local TV news and in front of a broader audience. The newspaper has 
won a string of awards for stories on smog, toxic chemicals in the city's water 
supply, contamination of the Santa Monica Bay, on secret business deals between 
city officials and prominent real estate developers and on the dearth of city 
services in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Weekly has also published evocative stories about people and neighborhoods, 
including one by Emery Holmes II on the heyday of a Pacoima barbershop called 
Stylesville. As described by Holmes, Stylesville was more mecca than 
barbershop, the sort of place where people would stop their cars to watch Duke 
Ellington get royally groomed. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no judgements in Stylesville," Holmes wrote. "The community elites 
-- the doctors, ministers, businessmen et al. -- rub shoulders with the 
rappers, the buppies and the welfare-fashion dukes. Nobody's going to laugh at 
your haircut or your politics in Stylesville." 
</P>
<P>
The Weekly is at its best in stories that see the city "from a peripheral angle 
. . . that explore the margins," said David Freeman, an author and screenwriter 
who has written for the Weekly. 
</P>
<P>
The Weekly is probably best known, however, for its political slant. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is left-wing," Jay Levin once proclaimed, and the newspaper has 
rarely deviated from its founder's world view. Levin sees the United States as 
a heavy on the international scene, in many ways responsible for the 
impoverishment of the Third World, its people and natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper's political edge distinguishes it from a number of alternative 
papers that, in order to survive, became little more than guidebooks to vintage 
clothes stores and exotic ice cream parlors. 
</P>
<P>
"The Weekly and a few other papers like it kept faith with the 1960s, the 
period of dissent that launched the underground/alternative press," said Martin 
Linsky, a former editor of an alternative weekly in Boston who now lectures on 
the press and politics at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if you don't agree with it, the Weekly reports with a sense of outrage 
and passion. It provides a reminder that the news matters," said David 
Armstrong, press critic for the San Francisco Examiner and the author of a book 
about the alternative press. 
</P>
<P>
However, critics of the Weekly argue that the newspaper's politics have colored 
its judgment and limited its impact. 
</P>
<P>
"One would like to see the Weekly less dogmatic and less predictable," said 
Ruth Hirschman, general manager of KCRW, a Santa Monica radio station and 
outlet for National Public Radio. "I think the Weekly's audience is capable of 
absorbing a much more complex level of discussion than is being offered." 
</P>
<P>
Any discussion of the Weekly's politics inevitably focuses on an October, 1988, 
story that quoted unnamed sources saying that George Bush, then a candidate for 
President, had engaged in a series of extramarital affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The story appeared in an issue of the paper that was otherwise devoted to 
probing Bush's association with CIA officials and other government figures 
linked to the Iran-Contra scandal. The Weekly printed evidence linking accused 
drug dealers with the U.S. government's Contra resupply effort. 
</P>
<P>
One article focused on several transport companies that received State 
Department funds to deliver humanitarian aid to the Contras. According to the 
Weekly, the CIA recommended the firms even though all four of them were targets 
of drug investigations and officials of two of the firms were under federal 
indictment. 
</P>
<P>
But those allegations were tainted, along with the Weekly's reputation, by the 
gossipy story about Bush's love life, critics argue. 
</P>
<P>
"The stories they (the Weekly) ran on Iran-Contra raised serious issues that 
the mainstream press should have been raising," said Bob Parry, a reporter for 
Newsweek magazine who has written extensively about Iran-Contra issues. "It's 
just too bad it got mixed up with the thing on Bush's personal life." 
</P>
<P>
Levin was editing the paper at the time and takes full responsibility for the 
story about Bush's personal life. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved that story, but, boy, did we take a lot of heat for it. . . . Did it 
diminish the value of the rest of the paper? I don't know. Maybe." 
</P>
<P>
A former New York Post reporter, Levin came West in 1978 to work for the old 
L.A. Free Press, then owned by Larry Flynt of Hustler magazine fame. The Free 
Press was folded after Flynt was shot and paralyzed outside a Georgia 
courthouse, where he was being tried on obscenity charges. 
</P>
<P>
Levin quickly rounded up a handful of investors, raised $225,000 and started 
the Weekly. 
</P>
<P>
Levin says the paper has made him "solidly wealthy on paper" and he seems 
comfortable in the role of counterculture capitalist: "I didn't set out to make 
a lot of money, but money is energy and you have to use the available energy in 
order to reach people." 
</P>
<P>
No longer editor of the paper, Levin has assumed the title of chairman of the 
Weekly's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rachlis works to improve the paper on an editorial budget that he 
says has been reduced by 15% from last year. The belt-tightening comes after a 
money-losing year -- the result, editors said, of sloppy management, of the 
cost of computerizing the paper's editorial operations and of losing a partial 
judgment to a former printer who sued the Weekly for alleged breach of 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
The future quality of the newspaper will also depend on its ability to 
negotiate a satisfactory contract with the 70 or more free-lance writers that 
the Weekly has come to depend on over the years. Writer David Steinman says the 
writers have asked for a 12-cent raise, to 32 cents a word, and that the Weekly 
has responded with an offer of 22 cents. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't voted yet on how we plan to respond to the Weekly's offer," 
Steinman said recently. 
</P>
<P>
When he came to the paper, Rachlis, a former executive editor of the Village 
Voice, said he demanded the freedom to do things his way, and added that he 
took the job only after Levin agreed to a contract granting him editorial 
autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Rachlis said, he believed that the paper should be less 
dogmatic. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I trust political debate more than Jay does," Rachlis said. "I think 
it was wrong for the paper never to criticize Jesse Jackson. I think it was 
wrong not to be more critical of Daniel Ortega. But that's not to say the paper 
shouldn't have endorsed Jackson for President (which it did) or fight 
ferociously against Contra aid." 
</P>
<P>
While Rachlis said he wants a paper that is more balanced, he realizes that, in 
the world of alternative journalism, there is such a thing as being too 
cautious. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, he called a group of staff members in to discuss the cover of an 
issue on art censorship. He wanted to reproduce artist Andre Serrano's 
notorious photograph of a crucifix resting in a bottle of urine. Encountering 
no objections, Rachlis put the image on the cover under the headline "What's 
Wrong With This Picture?" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't worry about offending people," he said.

REFORMERS RUN STRONGLY IN SOVIET VOTE; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTIONS: EARLY RESULTS OF REGIONAL AND LOCAL RACES CONFIRM THE GROWING POWER 
OF NEW POLITICAL MOVEMENTS. POPULIST YELTSIN WINS EASILY.

<P>
Pro-reform candidates, including radical populist Boris N. Yeltsin and several 
former political prisoners, won strong backing from voters in the Soviet 
Union's regional and local elections, according to preliminary results released 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Reformers, both within and outside the Communist Party, appeared to have 
captured a significant number of seats in voting Sunday for the parliaments of 
Russia, Byelorussia and the Ukraine, three of the Soviet Union's constituent 
republics, and on their local government councils. 
</P>
<P>
Although a second round of voting will be required in hundreds of contests, 
candidates wanting to accelerate the pace of reform and broaden its scope 
appeared to have secured a significant political victory in the Slavic 
heartland of the Soviet Union, both official reports and accounts from local 
sources indicated. 
</P>
<P>
The inclusion of a large number of reformers in the republic parliaments, as 
well as in many city and regional councils, should bring President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev the support that he says perestroika, his program of political and 
economic restructuring, has needed at lower levels to overcome bureaucratic 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
But some of the reformers' politics are well to the left of Gorbachev, and 
candidates nominated by nationalists have autonomy, if not independence, as 
their first priority. 
</P>
<P>
Early reports indicated that party officials generally managed to avoid the 
embarrassing first-round defeats that many had suffered in last year's national 
elections. Still, many have been forced into runoff elections this time. Under 
Gorbachev, party leaders who lose popular elections are expected to resign 
their positions. 
</P>
<P>
The elections confirmed the rapid ascendancy of new political movements -- such 
as Democratic Russia and, in the Ukraine, Rukh. They campaigned hard on behalf 
of the reformers, often against strong Communist Party machines, and brought 
the republics a step closer to multi-party politics. 
</P>
<P>
Although more than 80% of the candidates were members of the Communist Party, 
the elections had quickly become contests between conservatives who ran with 
party backing and liberals who made bolder reform the basis of their pitch to 
voters. These were the first elections in which voters in the three republics 
could choose from among candidates of different political movements. 
</P>
<P>
After the recent ouster of nearly 20 regional party leaderships because of 
mounting popular discontent, particularly over shortages of food and consumer 
goods as well as the abuse of power, party officials may have done well simply 
in avoiding defeat. 
</P>
<P>
The large number of candidates, an average of nearly seven for each seat in 
most constituencies and with more than 20 in some, complicated the election 
process considerably. As many as 85% of the contests appeared to be 
inconclusive Monday, according to state television, with no candidate winning 
more than half the votes cast. These require a runoff between the top two 
candidates in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
But activists in many areas took the runoffs as a partial but significant 
victory and said that the strong showing of opposition candidates in the first 
round of voting virtually guaranteed many of them victories in the second. 
</P>
<P>
More than 150 million people were registered to vote, and the turnouts Sunday 
ranged from 64% in Moscow and Leningrad to nearly 90% in some other cities, 
according to election officials. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, there were more than 11,000 candidates for 1,800 seats in the three 
republics' parliaments, and tens of thousands more candidates sought election 
to local governing councils. Official results will not be announced until March 
14. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who has become one of Gorbachev's sharpest and most vocal critics in 
recent months, won more than 72% of the vote, defeating 11 other candidates, in 
Sverdlovsk, an industrial center in the Ural Mountains that remains his 
political base. 
</P>
<P>
"The vote gives the possibility to strengthen reforms and allow new measures to 
be taken," Yeltsin said in Amsterdam, where he is promoting his recently 
published autobiography. "I have been urging Gorbachev to take a whole other 
tactic for perestroika. The results show I was right. I will advise him to go 
forward faster, with more strength." 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who remains a member of the Communist Party's policy-making Central 
Committee, had declared before the election that he would seek the presidency 
of the Russian Federation, the Soviet Union's largest republic, if elected, 
challenging Vitaly I. Vorotnikov, a member of the party's ruling Politburo, who 
now holds the post. 
</P>
<P>
But Yeltsin told a news conference in Amsterdam on Monday that he would need to 
assess the number of other reformers elected to the Russian Congress of 
People's Deputies and the strength of their support before committing himself. 
</P>
<P>
He warned, however, that if the various blocs, including radicals and 
conservatives, are not given proportional representation in the leadership of 
the Russian Parliament, he would quit the Communist Party and perhaps start a 
rival organization. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of candidates allied with Yeltsin in the Democratic Russia movement, a 
coalition of reform groups, also won first-round victories. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Sergei Kovalyov, a human rights campaigner and former political 
prisoner who had worked for years with the late Andrei D. Sakharov, the Nobel 
Peace laureate, appeared to have won election to the Russian Parliament. Lev 
Ponomaryov, another human rights activist, appeared to have won a place in a 
runoff vote. 
</P>
<P>
Two other prominent winners were Vyacheslav Starkov, editor of the liberal 
weekly newspaper Argumenty i Facty, and Alexander Politkovsky, a journalist on 
the avant-garde television program Vzglyad. 
</P>
<P>
Sergei Stankevich, a political scientist who has gained considerable popularity 
as a member of the national parliament, won election to the Moscow city 
council. Gavriil Popov, a liberal economist and Parliament member, secured a 
place in a runoff election for the council. Stankevich, Popov and others want 
to turn the council into a "liberated zone" and a high-profile base for reform. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow Mayor Valery Saikin and Yuri Prokofiev, the city's Communist Party 
leader, were both forced into runoff elections when they failed to get more 
than half of the votes cast. 
</P>
<P>
In Leningrad, the group Democratic Elections '90 said its candidates were ahead 
in 30 of 34 constituencies and were likely to win three-quarters of the seats 
on local and district councils after campaigns that focused on discontent over 
living standards in Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
In the Ukraine, the grass-roots national movement Rukh won most of the seats in 
the republic's Parliament from the west but only succeeded in forcing party 
candidates into runoff elections in the east. Many of the winners received more 
than 80% of the votes cast. 
</P>
<P>
Ivan Drach, a leading Ukrainian poet and Rukh's president, won more than 80% of 
the vote in his constituency in Lvov. Other Rukh winners included Vyacheslav 
Chornovil, a former dissident journalist, and Mikhail Horyn, the movement's 
secretary, who both served lengthy prison terms for their political activities. 
</P>
<P>
All but one of the 22 constituencies in Kiev will go to a second round of 
voting because of the tight contests between party candidates and Rukh members. 
</P>
<P>
In the Ukrainian coal mining center of Donetsk, several local Communist Party 
officials lost their races to candidates put up by the strike committees formed 
by miners last summer that now function as independent trade unions, according 
to the Radio Moscow news bulletin Interfax. 
</P>
<P>
In Byelorussia, a small republic northwest of the Ukraine on the Soviet border 
with Poland, Zenon Poznyka, the leader of the Byelorussian Popular Front, won 
59% of the vote in his district in the capital of Minsk, and other movement 
members reportedly did well in urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
In Lithuania, candidates for the nationalist Sajudis movement won additional 
seats in runoff elections, bringing to 90 the number of seats they now hold out 
of the 141 that have been filled. 
</P>

SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH: SIGNS OFTEN GO UNHEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANNY SCOTT, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fatal frenzy of the heart that on Sunday apparently killed college 
basketball star Hank Gathers takes the lives of about 400,000 Americans each 
year. Experts say one reason may be that physicians as well as patients 
underestimate early warning signs that could lead to sudden cardiac death. 
</P>
<P>
Those warning signs -- such as blackouts and heart palpitations reflecting an 
invisible defect in a person's heart -- can now be explored using various new 
techniques, and may be effectively treated to prevent the development of 
something worse. 
</P>
<P>
But some physicians are unaware of the seriousness of those signs and the 
importance of getting patients to specialized centers for screening, experts 
say. And some patients, particularly athletes, resist taking drugs that can 
impair their performance. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very steamed about this issue, because there are so many cases of this 
around," said Dr. David S. Cannom, director of cardiology at the Hospital of 
the Good Samaritan and co-chairman of a group called the Coalition for the 
Prevention of Sudden Death. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still well-meaning people that don't realize the potential risk to 
the patient," Cannom said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, cardiologists said Monday that it can be difficult to assess 
precisely the degree of risk a person faces from a heart abnormality. And it is 
a rare case in which a physician can tell a patient absolutely what exercise to 
do and not to do. 
</P>
<P>
They also emphasized that sudden cardiac death occurs only in people with 
diseased or damaged hearts. There is no evidence, they stressed, that exercise 
poses any risk to people with normal, healthy hearts. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers, 23, the sixth-leading collegiate basketball scorer in the country, 
died Sunday after collapsing during the first half of the Lions' West Coast 
Conference tournament semifinal game between his school, Loyola Marymount, and 
the University of Portland. 
</P>
<P>
The precise cause of Gathers' death was not known Monday. The Los Angeles 
County coroner's office performed an autopsy Monday afternoon, but no results 
were to be released for at least several days pending completion of 
toxicological tests and tissue studies. 
</P>
<P>
However, Gathers was known to have had so-called cardiac arrhythmia, an 
abnormality of the rhythm or rate of the heartbeat. The condition had been 
diagnosed during tests performed in December after Gathers passed out during a 
basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
Arrhythmia, caused by a disturbance in the electrical impulses to the heart, 
can lead to cardiac arrest. It is often related to structural defects in the 
heart, either congenital or acquired through disease. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews Monday, cardiologists said sudden cardiac death occurs most 
frequently in older men with heart disease. But perhaps one in 10 cases occurs 
in people under age 30, many of whom have had no previous indication that 
anything was wrong with their heart. 
</P>
<P>
Approximately 10 to 20 young athletes succumb each year to sudden cardiac 
death, said Dr. Steven Van Camp of San Diego, who has been studying such cases. 
Almost invariably, he said, an autopsy turns up some sort of defect or disease 
in the heart. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no evidence that exercise damages the healthy heart," said Van Camp, 
vice president of the American College of Sports Medicine. "But if people have 
significant heart disease, then exercise can present an increased risk." 
</P>
<P>
"Of the millions of apparently healthy athletes in this country, all but a 
handful are fully able to compete," Van Camp said. "The issue is how to find 
the handful who are at greatest risk." 
</P>
<P>
One tip-off can be difficulties brought on by exercise -- an unusual shortness 
of breath, chest discomfort, irregular heart rhythms or blackout spells. People 
who experience those symptoms should be evaluated carefully to assess their 
degree of risk, specialists say. 
</P>
<P>
Such an evaluation might involve monitoring the patient's heart during 
treadmill exercising, examining the heart's structure using ultrasound and 
recording with an electrocardiogram the electrical impulses that precede 
contraction of the heart muscle. 
</P>
<P>
If necessary, additional tests can be done to pinpoint the cause of an abnormal 
rhythm, Cannom said. Those include an angiogram to look for evidence of 
coronary artery disease, a biopsy of heart muscle tissue for infection, and 
other more elaborate procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Using those tools, it is now possible to estimate whether a patient is at low 
or high risk of cardiac arrest and sudden death, Cannom said. Patients, 
physicians and families must then decide how aggressively they wish to treat 
the condition. 
</P>
<P>
The choices include anti-arrhythmic drugs, which suppress the excitability of 
the heart, and a device called a defibrillator, which can be implanted in a 
person's chest to shock the failing heart back into normal rhythm when it goes 
awry. 
</P>
<P>
"Some may decide that it's a one-in-100 risk (of cardiac arrest) and they'll 
live with it," Cannom said. "Some will decide it's one in 20 and not to live 
with it and to have a defibrillator put in." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, each treatment has drawbacks. A defibrillator can cost $50,000 
to install and there can be complications. Anti-arrhythmic drugs can lower 
blood pressure, decrease heart rate and affect performance. 
</P>
<P>
"Young people often are not compliant with their medication," Van Camp said. 
"And athletes especially may be reluctant to take medications which they feel 
are affecting their performance, especially if they have been doing well for 
some period of time." 
</P>
<P>
Gathers, who began taking anti-arrhythmic drugs after his blackout in December, 
appeared lethargic initially and blamed the medication. Friends said Sunday 
night that Gathers had reduced his dosage or stopped taking medication 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
It is often unclear how much to restrict a patient, physicians said. 
</P>
<P>
"The concept is: How much smoke is there?" said one specialist who asked not to 
be named. "There are some very clear-cut cases in which people are restricted, 
and other cases in which they are not at high risk. Then there is a whole 
spectrum in between. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, if they are found to have abnormalities, and they are on medication, the 
issue is (whether) the medication is controlling the abnormality well enough, 
and will the patient take the medication," the specialist said. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, an underlying abnormality in the heart may not be the whole story. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Thomas N. James, president of the University of Texas Medical Branch at 
Galveston and a cardiologist who has studied sudden death and cardiac function 
among athletes, said sudden cardiac death is more often attributable to several 
factors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PATH OF A HEARTBEAT 
</P>
<P>
There are many types of abnormal heart rhythms, or arrhythmias. Some -- 
occasional skipped heart beat -- do not interfere with daily activities. Others 
-- very rapid or very slow heart beats -- can cause lightheadedness or 
fainting. Extremely abnormal rhythms prevent the heart from pumping blood and 
are often fatal.

SECRET PAPERS DENIED TO CAMARENA SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal district judge declined Monday to give secret papers filed by federal 
prosecutors to lawyers for a prominent Mexican businessman accused of plotting 
the murder of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Edward Rafeedie also declined to remove himself from the case as defense 
lawyers requested if he would not give them the information they sought. 
</P>
<P>
Rafeedie told Edward Medvene, attorney for Ruben Zuno Arce, that he was not 
entitled to material filed in confidence by prosecutors. Prosecutors have 
declined to divulge even the general subject matter of the papers. The judge 
cited several appellate court decisions permitting the government to make the 
secret filings. 
</P>
<P>
He said "the defendant's right to know is outweighed by the governmental 
interest" in keeping information confidential, either to protect witnesses or 
to maintain the integrity of an ongoing investigation into the Camarena murder. 
</P>
<P>
Zuno is scheduled to go on trial April 10 on charges that he helped plan the 
February, 1985, kidnaping, torture and murder of Camarena in Guadalajara. On 
several occasions, Zuno has proclaimed he is "absolutely innocent" of the 
charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's hearing stemmed from a motion filed by Zuno's lawyers in late January. 
The motion said there had been eight confidential filings submitted to Rafeedie 
and one to a federal appeals court in the case since last August. 
</P>
<P>
Zuno's lawyers alleged the Justice Department has been engaged in a "one-way 
dialogue" with the judge, and that the secret communication "raises questions 
as to the appearance of impartiality in the proceedings against" him. The 
motion also alleged that the secret documents deprive Zuno of due process. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors Manuel Medrano and John L. Carlton responded in writing 
that federal laws and several previous cases permit the filing of the secret 
papers. They also argued that the secret filings have been necessary for the 
protection of witnesses and informants. And they contended there was no proof 
the judge had been unfair in his handling of the case. 
</P>
<P>
After his motion was denied Monday, Medvene asked the judge to provide at least 
a summary of the allegations contained in the confidential filings. Rafeedie 
refused. 
</P>
<P>
Rafeedie is considering a motion by the lawyer for Juan Jose Bernabe Ramirez, 
another defendant in the case, to turn over the name of a confidential 
informant in the case. Mary Kelly said she needs the identity of the informant 
to prepare her case. She contended the government has promised to relocate the 
informant and therefore it is no longer valid to argue that the informant would 
be endangered if his identity were revealed. 
</P>
<P>
Medrano acknowledged the informant has been relocated, but he said revealing 
his identity could endanger the informant's family. After the hearing, Gregory 
Nicolaysen, another defense lawyer in the case, said that if prosecutors were 
concerned for the families of these informants, they could have relocated them 
also, possibly to a U.S. military base.

ASSEMBLYMAN BROWN WON'T SEEK ELECTION;

BROWN: GOP ASSEMBLYMAN WON'T RUN

<P>
Declaring that the Lord "wants me to do something else with my life," 
Assemblyman Dennis Brown (R-Los Alamitos) on Monday announced he will not seek 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, 40, a staunch conservative elected in 1978, emphasized that his 
announcement followed six to eight months of prayer and was not a last-minute 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been up here 12 years . . . and I never intended to stay this long. 
Before I get too decrepit, I want to do something else," said Brown, whose 
negative votes on a variety of issues earned him the nickname "Dr. No." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Brown said, he will have more time for religious activities. In fact, he 
is immediately resigning from the powerful Ways and Means Committee to have 
time to attend Bible classes at a fundamentalist center in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, a former stockbroker, said he may also return to the brokerage business. 
But he would not rule out running for office in 1992 or 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's colleagues expressed surprise at his decision to drop out of the race. 
It is expected to touch off a scramble to succeed him in the heavily Republican 
58th Assembly District, which includes Seal Beach and a part of Los Alamitos 
and Huntington Beach in Orange County and parts of Long Beach and Signal Hill 
in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Even before Brown's decision, he faced a challenge from Democrat Joel R. 
Bishop, 32, a Long Beach computer systems analyst who works for the Orange 
County government. Monday, Democrat Luanne Pryor, owner of a public relations 
firm and an unsuccessful candidate for Long Beach mayor in 1988, said she is 
also planning to run. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Republicans considering the race is Huntington Beach Mayor Thomas J. 
Mays, who has gained attention with his high-profile handling of the county's 
oil spill last month. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm definitely taking a look at it," Mays said Monday. "I was really looking 
at 1992 because I didn't expect any of our local legislators to be leaving 
office. But I guess opportunities come along and they have to be evaluated." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Seymour Alban of Long Beach, a past president of the Long Beach Medical 
Assn., was also mentioned as a possible Republican candidate. 
</P>
<P>
With Brown dropping out, Friday's deadline to file election papers for the 
Assembly seat will be extended until March 14. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since Brown's 1978 election, in which he supported the property 
tax-cutting Proposition 13, Brown has been a charter member of the Assembly's 
"cavemen" faction, known for their fundamental political beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
Among others in the group were Brown's friends, Assemblymen Pat Nolan 
(R-Glendale) and John Lewis (R-Orange). In the past year or so, Nolan has been 
the target of a federal political corruption probe and Lewis was indicted for 
his role in preparing allegedly phony presidential endorsement letters. A state 
appeal court in January dismissed a felony forgery charge against Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
In part because of these two cases, Brown said, "the whole atmosphere (is) more 
tense and less friendly" in the Capitol. Also contributing to what Brown called 
a lack of "pleasantness" has been increasing pressure to raise money to run for 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's announcement is the second by a Republican lawmaker in the past week. 
Assemblywoman Marian W. La Follette (R-Northridge) last Tuesday announced that 
she is not running for reelection, saying lawmakers should not serve more than 
10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) said Brown and La Follette will be 
missed because they "are the glue that holds the party together up here," 
citing their encouragement of moderate GOP lawmakers to toe a conservative 
line. 
</P>

POLICIES: PROTESTERS DENOUNCE THE CHANCELLOR'S NEGATIVE RESPONSE TO PREVIOUS

Two dozen UC Irvine students marched into the university's administration 
building lobby Monday and demanded that Chancellor Jack W. Peltason allow gay 
and lesbian couples access to campus family housing. 
</P>
<P>
As startled college employees and students watched, the activists chanted 
"Justice" and "Hey, hey, ho, ho discrimination's got to go." After a series of 
impassioned speeches comparing their cause to the Civil Rights movement, the 
activists went outside and built a new cardboard shantytown near one of the 
chief entrances to the administration building. They posted a sign saying 
"Shantytown, We're Back." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Peltason gave a written response to a list of demands made by 
students who built a shantytown in February that stood for 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
In it, Peltason says the university will explore hiring an advocate to 
represent the homosexual community, but he rejects claims that gays, lesbians 
and those who form other non-traditional couples deserve the same status as 
married couples in university family housing. 
</P>
<P>
The chancellor wrote that although he is personally committed to equal 
treatment regardless of sexual orientation, student housing policy is 
determined by state law and by the UC Board of Regents. 
</P>
<P>
During the rally, the activists called on Peltason to look beyond the letter of 
the law. 
</P>
<P>
"You claim to respect diversity, but as long as heterosexual students are 
allowed to live with their families on campus and homosexual students are not, 
that access is not equal," protest organizer Judy Olson said, her voice echoing 
through the enclosed lobby. "Mr. Chancellor, words are not enough. Your actions 
place you firmly on the side of irrational and hate-filled prejudice." 
</P>
<P>
Peltason will not budge, however, UC Irvine spokeswoman Linda Granell said. 
"The chancellor feels he had made his response to the students," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The students say they will live at the new shantytown for a week. They also 
have issued Peltason an ultimatum: come back with "a written and concrete 
commitment to the adoption of a domestic partnership policy" within 48 hours or 
face an act of civil disobedience. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a student who took a public stance in favor of Peltason's actions 
has filed a complaint with the administration, saying she has received a dozen 
harassing phone calls.

GOODBY TO HUNTINGTON BEACH WELLS; 
</P>
<P>
OCEANFRONT: OFFICIALS SIGN A 'LANDMARK' AGREEMENT WITH THE OIL COMPANY TO CAP 
THE WELLS AND REMOVE THE DERRICKS.

Bobbing oil derricks by the sea will soon be a thing of the past, the City 
Council announced Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
In an agreement hailed as "a landmark," Chevron USA and the council on Monday 
sealed an agreement for the capping of 25 oil wells on the ocean side of 
Pacific Coast Highway north of the pier. The shutdown is to begin within the 
next three months. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron USA officials said they had agreed to close down the wells even though 
more than $1 million in oil could still be extracted from them. Council members 
voted unanimously to approve the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"We are doing this both to help the city and for safety reasons," said David 
Villa, an attorney for Chevron USA. 
</P>
<P>
Villa said the city has built a bluff-top park in the area of the oil wells and 
that many motorists park nearby. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting pedestrian traffic has made operation of the wells something of a 
safety concern, Villa said. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said the city has been negotiating with the oil company over 
the past seven years and the agreement to close the wells is a historic 
breakthrough for city beautification. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a real landmark," Councilman John Erskine said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for capping the wells and removing derrick equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"Chevron is agreeable to terminate its surface rights in order to enable the 
city's unencumbered use of the property," the agreement reads. Chevron agreed 
to pay most of the costs for the closure, with the city's contribution not to 
exceed $650,000. 
</P>
<P>
Villa noted that Chevron, had it chosen to hold out and keep the wells active, 
could have produced at least $1.2 million in revenue. But he said the oil 
company is pleased to have worked out a closure agreement with the city. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal officials said the removal of Chevron's 25 oil wells on the 
oceanfront would leave only four wells in that area. Those belong to Shell Oil 
Co., and the city is negotiating with Shell for their removal, staff officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The wells date back to the 1920s, according to Louis F. Sandoval, director of 
public works. At one time, Huntington Beach was studded with a network of 
high-rise oil derricks. 
</P>
<P>
The derricks were built after the famous oil strike of 1920, which made 
Huntington Beach one of the major oil cities in the world. The city was a 
sleepy seaside village then, and few objected to the construction of derricks 
-- even along the beach. 
</P>
<P>
But in recent years, a growing environmental movement in the city has worked 
for the removal of oil wells and unsightly derricks along the oceanfront. A 
decline in oil production in the area has hastened the changes. 
</P>
<P>
The city has been promoting itself more as a tourist and business area than as 
an oil-producing city, and a multimillion-dollar redevelopment project in 
downtown Huntington Beach is geared toward enhancing tourist and convention 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Even though oil reserves have been declining, there is still a large pool of 
oil under the city. Villa, in response to a question from Mayor Thomas J. Mays, 
said Monday night that Chevron had anticipated keeping the wells active for 15 
more years. 
</P>
<P>
Villa credited the negotiating skill of Sandoval in helping to arrange a 
speedier exit of the oil wells. "Lou is a very good negotiator," Mays agreed. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview after the meeting, Villa said that most of the 25 oil wells 
will be removed by late summer and all will be gone by March, 1991.

DEFAMATION SUIT BY EX-CHIEF DISMISSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A $1-million defamation lawsuit by former Police Chief Kelson McDaniel against 
several city officials and policemen has been dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Commissioner Ronald Bauer ruled that attorneys for McDaniel 
failed to prove that the former chief was libeled by criticism made by four 
police officers who spoke before the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel resigned under pressure from City Hall in 1987 after 90% of the 
50-member San Clemente Peace Officers Assn. cast votes of no-confidence against 
him, complaining that he had a punitive and non-communicative management style. 
</P>
<P>
In his suit alleging defamation, emotional stress and invasion of privacy, 
McDaniel claimed that the City Council should not have allowed the four 
officers to criticize him publicly. 
</P>
<P>
The suit named the city of San Clemente, Councilwoman Holly Veale, then-City 
Manager James Hendrickson and Officers Russ Moore, Rick Rivadeneyra, Tom Haight 
and Neil Murray. 
</P>
<P>
Trial had been scheduled to begin in Superior Court on March 26. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I'm disappointed in the judge's decision," said McDaniel, who is 
interim police chief in Pomona. He declined to comment further on the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel said he will review the case with his attorney, Fred Ashley of Laguna 
Niguel, before deciding whether to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Representing the city, David Larsen of Costa Mesa-based Rutan and Tucker, said 
the ruling helped preserve First Amendment rights guaranteeing free speech. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be a sorry day when a First Amendment protest made in public 
results in this kind of liability," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Veale said she is relieved that the case didn't go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel vindicated," she said. "The City Council is in a position where we have 
to look on police officers as part of our constituency." 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel, 52, is one of several candidates for police chief in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
He said that his setback in court would not affect his chances of winning the 
Pomona job. 
</P>
<P>
"They knew all about this situation before they hired me," he said. "I don't 
think it will make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
A law enforcement veteran of 26 years, McDaniel was a police officer in Newport 
Beach for 17 years. Besides his 18 months as the top law enforcement official 
in San Clemente, he served as police chief in Los Alamitos for six years. FRANK

HEARING TONIGHT ON COYOTE HILLS PROJECT

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council will hold a public hearing at 7:30 tonight to consider 
allowing 220 homes to be built in the East Coyote Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach developer J.M. Peters Co. Inc. will appeal a Planning Commission 
vote in February to reject the company's plans for 110 houses and 110 
condominium units to be built at State College Boulevard and Bastanchury Road. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the commissioners said plans for the gated housing community pack too 
many units into the hilly area and require too much of the hill to be 
flattened. The master plan for the area requires buildings to follow the 
contour of the hill as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
The plans call for condominiums to be built on graded land near the 
intersection. The houses would wrap around north, east and south of the 
condominiums on a lower portion of the land bordering Craig Regional Park. TOM

EX-OFFICIAL ACCUSED OF IMPROPER MAILING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Fair Political Practices Commission has accused former Santa Ana City 
Councilman Wilson B. Hart of improperly mailing thousands of letters during the 
1989 council campaign. 
</P>
<P>
According to the complaint, the Friends of Wilson Hart Committee sent out 
11,000 letters purportedly by former Santa Ana Police Chief Raymond Davis 
suggesting that the other City Council candidates had "conflicts of interest." 
The mailings were paid by Hart's committee. 
</P>
<P>
The letters were in violation of the state's 1974 Political Reform Act because 
Hart failed to identify himself as the sender or mention his committee, the 
complaint said. According to the act, "the name of a candidate and his or her 
controlled committee must appear in at least 6-point type on the outside of 
each piece of a mass mailing." 
</P>
<P>
In another letter, Hart's committee sent a reprint of a newspaper article that 
further described conflicts of interest by the other candidates. "The mailing 
emphasized the fact that Mr. Hart had not been mentioned in the article as 
having a conflict of interest," the complaint read. 
</P>
<P>
In those letters, Hart also did not identify himself or his committee as the 
sender. 
</P>
<P>
The FPPC filed the two-count complaint Monday against Hart, who finished the 
April 4, 1989, election in third place. Hart, an attorney, faces up to $2,000 
in fines for each count if he is found guilty. He will have to go before an 
administrative judge, who would then make recommendation to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Hart declined to comment on the charge, which was filed in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint was brought after the FPPC received "sufficient evidence to bring 
about enforcement action," said Sandra Michioku, a commission spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
The identification of candidates are needed in mass mailings so that voters can 
assess the political messages in the campaign material, Michioku noted. 
</P>
<P>
Hart was a councilman from 1984 to 1988. He lost to Councilman John Acosta in 
1988 after the city was divided into different wards because of redistricting. 
</P>
<P>
Hart had been running against swap meet operator Richards Norton, who won the 
race. The other candidates were businessman Lyle Overby, transportation 
official Lisa Mills and real estate agent William Camp. LILY ENG

EX-BIKER HAS NEW WHEELS IN HIS LIFE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mikel Bistany admits that his life hasn't just turned around; it has spun 
around. 
</P>
<P>
A former motorcycle gang member who "took my frustrations out with my fists," 
Bistany, 38, is now interim head of Orange Coast College's department of 
physical education for handicapped students. He also coaches the college's 
wheelchair basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
"I have the best job in the world," Bistany said. "I wouldn't be here if it 
weren't for these people. I get love in my job. Not many people can say that." 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, however, Bistany lead a different life. 
</P>
<P>
"I was 300 pounds with long hair, a beard, leather jacket and aviation 
goggles," he said. Fighting "was a way of life. My father was physically 
abusive, and it left me with a lot of anger." 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Bistany owned a motorcycle parts business. One day he realized 
that a teen-ager in his shop was emulating his destructive behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to be that kind of a role model. So I decided to straighten 
myself out." 
</P>
<P>
He went from biker to bodybuilder. He devised a rigorous physical fitness 
routine that helped him lose more than 100 pounds in just over a year. "I also 
stopped experimenting with every drug imaginable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, he enrolled in a fitness training program at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
"But I really wanted to find a way to help other people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He volunteered to help in physical education classes for the handicapped and 
was eventually hired as a teaching assistant. He learned physical therapy and 
devised therapeutic exercises for students disabled by accidents, birth defects 
or illnesses such as multiple sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
Bistany continued working at OCC while completing his bachelor's degree at 
National University in Westminster. Now he is working on a master's degree at 
Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Although his new responsibilities make his schedule hectic, Bistany decided to 
help coach the college wheelchair basketball team this year. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a gift. He is very loving and patient," said Lynn Fischl, who hired 
Bistany. "But he also threw himself into learning the chemistry, anatomy and 
physiology that go along" with coaching handicapped people. 
</P>
<P>
As a college administrator, Bistany "hates red tape, and sometimes he just goes 
out and spends his own time and money on things for the students," she said. 
But he has accomplished a lot within the system because his enthusiasm wins 
people over. "That's pretty good for someone who spent most of his life in 
rebellion against authority." 
</P>
<P>
Bistany himself has mild dyslexia, a learning disability that interferes with 
perception. "But his determination helps him overcome it. He is amazingly quick 
to learn new concepts," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The mechanical skills Bistany once used to work on motorcycles are now used to 
adapt equipment in the campus weight room so it can be used by the handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
"He makes us work," said Robyn Grimmer, one of Bistany's students who credits 
his encouragement with improving her self-esteem. "He taught me to start 
something, even if I wasn't good at it, and then keep working to improve," she 
said.JANICE L. JONES

LAGUNA HILLS NURSE AWAITS HEART-LUNG TRANSPLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Laguna Hills nurse who for 12 years has worked to save lives now lies 
tethered to a lung machine at UC San Diego Medical Center, waiting for an organ 
transplant needed to save her own life. 
</P>
<P>
Catherine Renee Williams, 34, has spent a month at the hospital, while doctors 
search to find suitable donors for a lung or heart-lung transplant. She suffers 
from Eisenmenger's Complex, a rare disease that has left a hole the size of a 
silver dollar in her heart and has also damaged her lungs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not scared of the surgery, but I don't like the thought of dying yet," 
said Williams, a former mountain climber, scuba diver, amateur ballet dance and 
weightlifter, who stands 5 feet 2 inches and weighs 100 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really mad," she said. "The waiting is real hard. It gets frustrating. 
They've just moved me to my fourth room." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the severity of her illness, Williams is first in line at the 
hospital for a lung or heart-lung transplant, out of three such patients in the 
county, said Dr. Stuart Jamieson , who leads the UC San Diego Medical Center 
team that would operate if a donor surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
"She was born with a hole in her heart, and blood is coming through (that) 
hole, which has generated high pressure in her lungs," Jamieson said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we were simply to patch the hole, it wouldn't work," Jamieson said, 
explaining that the resulting pressure on the lungs would cause them to 
explode. However, he added, as Williams' condition worsens and the time to find 
an ideal donor diminishes, there is a "very rare" surgery that could repair her 
heart in conjunction with a lung transplant. 
</P>
<P>
Complicating Williams' situation is a severe shortage of donor organs in San 
Diego County. Dr. Michael Kay, director of the International Society for Heart 
Transplant Registry in San Diego, said the area's decreasing donor pool could 
be because seat belt laws have contributed to fewer accident fatalities. At the 
same time, he said, more accident victims may have been infected with the AIDS 
virus, making them ineligible donors. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Williams' parents said they have spent nearly all their money moving 
from Tennessee to an apartment three blocks from the hospital. Her fiance, 
Brian Bora of Laguna Hills, spends his days in the hospital and works nights as 
a bartender. 
</P>
<P>
"Every week that goes by, we say, 'maybe this week someone will donate a lung,' 
" said William's mother Shirley King, 56, who keeps a nightly vigil in a 
plastic chair beside her daughter's bed. "This is pretty heartbreaking. She was 
always perky, full of life, and now she could die." 
</P>
<P>
Williams' former co-workers at Saddleback Memorial Medical Center in Laguna 
Hills, where she worked as an obstetric nurse, were instrumental in providing 
the money for her medical bills. They raised $56,000, which was then matched by 
the hospital, said Paul Henry, vice president of human resources. 
</P>
<P>
"We just couldn't sit by and do nothing," Henry said, explaining that the 
hospital's insurance provider wouldn't cover medical expenses because the heart 
problem was considered a pre-existing condition. Williams also had worked only 
five months at the hospital, making her ineligible for full benefits, he added. 
</P>
<P>
According to Williams, two examinations by specialists in past years failed to 
detect the heart defect. It was not until last September, when she saw her 
fingers turning blue after helping deliver a baby, that a cardiologist at the 
hospital found she had Eisenmenger's Complex. 
</P>
<P>
And although four lungs have been available to Williams in the last two months, 
the organs were rejected by doctors because they were the wrong size or blood 
type, Jamieson said. 
</P>
<P>
"It stinks," Williams said of her ordeal. "It doesn't bother me being one of 
the first (in San Diego) to have this operation. What is my choice? I'm dying."

SERVICES PLANNED FOR CAL STATE FULLERTON PROF. FLOYD THOMAS, 51

Memorial services are planned Thursday for Floyd W. Thomas, a Cal State 
Fullerton engineering professor who died at home last week after an extended 
illness. He was 51. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas had suffered a brain tumor several years ago that continued to affect 
his health, university officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to teach classes in the fall semester last year, but poor health 
forced him to resign, university spokesman Jerry Keating said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas joined the university as a part-time lecturer in mechanical engineering 
in 1968 and was appointed to a full-time professorship a year later. He earned 
his bachelor's degree at the University of South Carolina and his master's and 
doctoral degrees from North Carolina State University. 
</P>
<P>
Keating said Thomas was respected by students and faculty members: "He was a 
very caring person who not only emphasized good teaching but good interaction 
with students. He was known by his colleagues as being good at getting things 
done." 
</P>
<P>
Besides serving in several administrative posts, Thomas was an active member of 
the Academic Senate. Keating said that Thomas also started the Minority/Women 
Student Recruitment/Retention Program and other such projects. 
</P>
<P>
"As a teacher, he developed many new programs and integrated computer usage 
into many courses," Keating said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas is survived by his wife, Del, and a brother, Henry G. Thomas of 
Columbia, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
The memorial service will be conducted at 4 p.m. in Mackey Auditorium of the 
Ruby Gerontology Center. 
</P>
<P>
His wife has suggested that, in lieu of flowers, contributions be made to a 
scholarship fund for mechanical engineering students established in Thomas' 
name by the CSUF Foundation.

Arraignment was postponed Monday for a 21-year-old Fullerton man charged with 
the murder of a 3-year-old girl he was baby-sitting and with the attempted 
murder of the suspect's mother and a man. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Robert Pacewitz was ordered held without bail in Orange County Jail 
while awaiting a March 16 arraignment date. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender Jim Appel said he asked for the postponement because he 
has received little information from police about the case. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton police said they arrested Pacewitz about 6 a.m. Saturday after he 
telephoned them and, according to officers, confessed to stabbing to death 
Marcelline Onick, the 3-year-old daughter of a fellow church member. 
</P>
<P>
The child's mother, Joanne Boydston, 25, reportedly had left her daughter and 
9-month-old son with another friend Friday. Pacewitz later relieved the friend 
in baby-sitting duties, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton Police Sgt. Don Kimbro said Monday that the attempted-murder charges 
stem from an earlier incident Friday in which Pacewitz allegedly stabbed his 
mother and a man during a family argument in Anaheim. Kimbro referred questions 
of that investigation to Anaheim police detectives, who could not be reached 
for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Mel Jensen filed a criminal complaint against Pacewitz 
charging him with the murder of the girl and attempted murder of Elena George 
Fontaine and Juan Martinez Marin. Jensen would not answer questions about any 
of the charges or further identify the relationships between the alleged 
victims and Pacewitz. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Court Judge Linda Lancet Miller said she was holding Pacewitz without 
bail "based on the nature of the crime and the potential danger to the 
community."

MATER DEI TAKES IT GAME AT A TIME

<P>
The Mater Dei High School boys' basketball team enters Southern California 
Division I regional play at 7:30 tonight with one eye on first-round opponent 
North Hollywood and another on longtime rival Long Beach Poly. 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Mater Dei (30-1) plays host to North Hollywood (23-3) at Ocean 
View High. North Hollywood upset Fremont, 76-71, in the Los Angeles City 
section's 3-A championship game with forward Dana Jones scoring 29 points and 
pulling down 29 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Harry Marks played a key role in North Hollywood's title run, improving 
his scoring average from 14 points in the regular season to 26 points in the 
playoffs. Robert Hill averages 12 points for North Hollywood, which allows an 
average of only 52 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei has won 22 consecutive games since losing to Long Beach Poly, 54-47, 
in the title game of the Tournament of Champions at Ocean View in December. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't shoot very well against them in the Tournament of Champions, and 
yeah, we'd like another shot at Poly," Andy Karich said. "Our goal this year 
was to win every game and the state title. 
</P>
<P>
"Since we lost that game to Poly, our goal has continued to be to win the state 
title. We know we have to beat two good teams if we hope to get another shot at 
Poly." 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Poly (26-2) is the top-seeded team in the division and opens against 
Loyola at Long Beach College. Mater Dei defeated Loyola, 83-57, Saturday night 
to win the Southern Section 5-A title. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei and Long Beach Poly were the most dominant programs in the Southern 
Section in the 1980s. Poly won the state title in 1984 after defeating Mater 
Dei, 45-44, in the Southern Section 5-A championship. Mater Dei won the state 
title in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Poly Coach Rod Palmer is one of two Southern California coaches with a winning 
record (3-1) against Mater Dei Coach Gary McKnight, who is 223-19 in eight 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The Division I championship has been moved to 8:30 p.m. Friday at the Los 
Angeles Sports Arena to avoid a conflict with a Clippers' game Saturday. Other 
divisional title games are scheduled for Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In Division III: 
</P>
<P>
Tulare Western (12-12) at Estancia (20-9), 7:30 p.m.: Tulare Western finished 
third in the East Yosemite League but came on strong in the Central Section 
playoffs. LeRohn Dodson averages 14 points and Rayland Elzy averages 13.8 
points for Tulare Western. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Agustin Heredia led Estancia in the 3-AA playoffs. Heredia scored 32 
points in a triple overtime victory over Lompoc in the semifinals and scored 32 
points in a 51-49 overtime victory over Servite in the title game. Against 
Servite, Heredia sent the game into overtime with a 12-foot baseline shot with 
two seconds remaining and then made five free throws in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Servite (17-11) at LeMoore (18-9), 8 p.m.: Servite center Steve Marusich will 
have to rebound from a poor showing performance (13 points) in the 3-AA 
division title game. Marusich had been averaging 20 points in four previous 
playoff games. Sophomore Adam Anderson has been Servite's steadiest performer. 
</P>
<P>
Center Jimmy Moore averages 16.6 points and 10.1 rebounds a game for LeMoore. 
Gene Smith averages 11.3 points and 7.2 rebounds. LeMoore allows only 56.4 
points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar (19-10) at San Diego Lincoln (22-8), 7:30 p.m.: Corona del Mar 
Coach Paul Orris is still wondering what happened to the final second on the 
Bren Center clock in his 39-38 overtime loss to Dos Pueblos in the 3-A title 
game. Center Jeff Jackson averages 13 points and eight rebounds per game for 
Corona del Mar and teammate Warren Johnson had 14 points against Dos Pueblos. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln has 12 consecutive victories and five consecutive league titles. Center 
Darryl McMillan leads Lincoln with a 19.8 scoring and 12.5 rebounding average 
and guard Victor Dean averages 14.2 points a game. Lincoln averages 80.3 points 
a game. 
</P>
<P>
In Division IV: 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach (22-6) at Coronado (19-8), 7:30 p.m.: Laguna Beach gets a second 
chance after blowing a 14-point lead and the 2-A division title to St. Joseph 
last Saturday. Center Dain Blanton, a three-year starter, averages 19.5 points 
and 12 rebounds for the Artists. 
</P>
<P>
Derek Wastila, a 6-4 forward, averages 16.7 points for Coronado. He also 
blocked 12 shots in one game earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
In Division V: 
</P>
<P>
St. Margaret's (21-5) vs. El Cajon Christian (16-11) at Granite Hills High, 
7:30 p.m: Ryan Westendorf, who has dominated smaller players all season, will 
meet his match in this game. Westendorf averages 25.8 points and 19.2 rebounds 
for St. Margaret's. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Clark of El Cajon Christian has averaged 44 points and 14 rebounds a game 
since transferring from Valhalla. Clark, who has signed with the University of 
Arizona, scored 64 points and had 21 rebounds in a San Diego section playoff 
game.

COUNTY GIRLS' TEAMS HOPE HISTORY REPEATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
This season's crop of girls' high school basketball teams can only hope to 
enjoy the same success Orange County teams did in last year's Southern 
California Regional playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda won state Division III and Southern Section 3-A titles, and Katella 
won the 4-A title and was a Division II finalist. This season, three schools 
won section titles and will compete tonight at 7:30. La Quinta won the 4-A 
title, Brea-Olinda the 3-AA and Costa Mesa (3-A) won its first section 
basketball title, boys or girls, over Rancho Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
Of the four girls' team playing, Brea-Olinda (30-0) has the best chance of 
winning a state title. Brea, ranked No. 1 in the state, has a 52-game victory 
streak and returns four starters from last season's state-champion team, 
including Aimee McDaniel, the Division III player of the year last season. 
</P>
<P>
But two other Orange County teams also have hopes of a Division III title. 
Costa Mesa will play Selma and Rancho Alamitos will meet LeMoore in Tuesday's 
other first-round Division III games. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta, the fourth-seeded team in Division II, will play host to Sanger 
(22-11) Tuesday in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs are led by Amy Jalewalia, who led the state in scoring last season 
with a 32-point average. This season, she leads Orange County in scoring and is 
second in the state in scoring with a 32.6 average. 
</P>
<P>
If the Aztecs can win their next three games, they will advance to the state 
championships March 16-17 in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
In Division II: 
</P>
<P>
Sanger (22-11) at La Quinta (27-2): Jalewalia, a 6-foot-1 center who will 
attend UCLA in the fall, leads the team in scoring, rebounding and steals. The 
Aztecs play an up-tempo style, relying on full-court pressure. Junior forward 
Heather Brannan averages 15 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Sanger, the Central Section Division II runner-up, gets balanced scoring from a 
front line that features three players who are 5-10 or taller. 
</P>
<P>
Senior center Cathy Isom (5-11) is the only Apache averaging in double figures 
in scoring (11.3 points and 8.3 rebounds). Freshman center Brandi Honn (5-10) 
averages 9.5 points and four rebounds. Senior forward Annie Lovett (5-11) 
averages 8.7 points and 7.2 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
In Division III: 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Lincoln (16-6) at Brea-Olinda (30-0): Brea-Olinda returns four 
starters from last year's team. Point guard McDaniel runs a potent offense that 
features double-figure scorers Tammy Blackburn, Jody Anton and Jinelle 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln is led by 6-3 junior center Sheila Dixon (26 points, 18.0 rebounds). 
Senior guard Abena Byrd averages 9.9 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Selma (14-10) at Costa Mesa (17-11): Costa Mesa, which went from a third-place 
finish in the Pacific Coast League to win the 3-A title, is the Cinderella 
story of the Southern Section. Olivia DiCamilli leads the Mustangs, averaging 
15.8 points. Junior forward Rachel Ward and senior point guard Thuy Nguyen 
average 11 points each. 
</P>
<P>
Selma is led by sisters Anjelica and Etelisia Guzman. 
</P>
<P>
Anjelica, who is 5-2, averages 10 points and Etelisia (5-3) averages 10.7 
points. Stephanie Rhodes, a 6-1 junior, averages 9.2 points. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Alamitos (21-4) at LeMoore (20-7): Rancho Alamitos, under first-year 
coach Bob Becker, lost to Costa Mesa in the 3-A final. The Vaqueros have a 
tough draw in the regional playoffs on the road against Central Section 
champion LeMoore. Rancho Alamitos relies heavily on senior guard-forward Jenny 
Newsome (23 points a game). Other key players are Shellie Tsuji (14 points) and 
Anita Stecker (10.4 points). 
</P>
<P>
LeMoore is averaging 52.3 points a game while holding opponents to 39.

GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: LA QUINTA'S BRANNAN SHINES IN SHADOW OF STAR 
TEAMMATE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Heather Brannan of La Quinta High School hasn't had much time at center stage. 
She has spent most of this season waiting in the wings. 
</P>
<P>
But when you're a teammate of Amy Jalewalia, it's difficult to steal the 
spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
Brannan's role was increased Friday night in the Southern Section 4-A girls' 
basketball final. Brannan, The Times' Athlete of the Week, had 25 points and 14 
rebounds in a 72-62 victory over West Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
"She was active and took advantage of her opportunities," Coach Kevin Kiernan 
said. "Sometimes in big games, Heather doesn't get mentally into it. I think 
she gets a little scared. She tends to stand around and watch sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
That's easy to do when you play on the same team as Jalewalia, who averaged 32 
points a game this season. Jalewalia scored 32 points in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
At times, Brannan and her teammates have let Jalewalia do the bulk of the work. 
However, in the championship game, Brannan felt that had to change. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew Amy would have a great game, but whatever the rest of us did would put 
us over the top," said Brannan, a 5-foot-10 junior forward. 
</P>
<P>
West Torrance double- and sometimes triple-teamed Jalewalia, which left Brannan 
open. She responded by making nine of 18 shots. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time Heather comes through, it takes the pressure off me," Jalewalia said. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't the first time Brannan has come through for the Aztecs. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the season, Kiernan suspended Jalewalia one game for disciplinary 
reasons. With Jalewalia out, Brannan picked up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
She had 37 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists as La Quinta defeated 
Pacifica, 73-18. 
</P>
<P>
Brannan, who has been on the varsity since she was a freshman, averages 15 
points and 12 rebounds. But because Jalewalia graduates this years, Brannan 
will have to do even more next season. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's put it this way: if Heather doesn't come back, then I don't come back," 
Kiernan said. "She's going to be the franchise next season." 
</P>
<P>
TOP PERFORMERS 
</P>
<P>
Tammy Blackburn of Brea-Olinda scored 12 points in a 50-33 victory over Palos 
Verdes for the Southern Section 3-AA championship Wednesday. Blackburn held 
Palos Verdes' leading scorer, Lisa Humphreys, 10 points below her 15.4 average. 
</P>
<P>
Robyn Camarillo of Mater Dei scored a goal in a 2-0 victory over Santa Barbara 
Saturday in the Southern Section 3-A soccer final. Olivia DiCamilli of Costa 
Mesa scored only nine points in Wednesday's 3-A championship basketball game 
against Rancho Alamitos, but eight were in the fourth quarter en route to 51-49 
victory.

COUNTRIES IN EASTERN BLOC FIND CHIQUITA BANANAS VERY A-PEELING

<P>
The Eastern bloc countries are going bananas over Chiquita. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Berlin Wall went down, that opened the way for Chiquita in East 
Germany," said Sandra Heimann, spokeswoman for United Brands, Cincinnati-based 
parent of Chiquita Brands Inc. Some of the East Germans had never even seen a 
banana before, Heimann said. 
</P>
<P>
"They go crazy over them." 
</P>
<P>
Spurred by the booming market, the 25-person transportation division of 
Chiquita is moving to Antwerp, Belgium, to provide better logistics for the 
distribution of bananas and other fresh fruit in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Europe has been a major market for Chiquita, the largest banana distributor on 
the continent, even before the opening of the Eastern bloc countries. One 
Western Europe importer of bananas has been a major customer, distributing 
about 7% of the bananas sold by Chiquita. 
</P>
<P>
"We started selling bananas to the Russians in the Soviet Union last year," 
Heimann said. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of bananas and other fruits in the Eastern bloc market are not 
substantial yet, but United Brands is looking forward to exploiting the 
potential, one that can be realized without large start-up costs. 
</P>
<P>
United Brands is a subsidiary of American Financial Corp.

Federal thrift regulators have restricted certain operations of San Clemente 
Savings Bank, including making large home loans, because the institution does 
not meet recently enacted capital requirements, the institution said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, San Clemente Savings 
said that as a result it has asked the parent, American Pacesetter in Newport 
Beach, to inject additional capital. The thrift also plans to sell some assets 
to raise funds. 
</P>
<P>
The restrictive order from the U.S. Office of Thrift Supervision prohibits the 
S&amp;L from declaring dividends, increasing executive salaries, making 
single-family home loans of more than $300,000, selling large assets without 
regulatory approval or transacting business with affiliated parties. 
</P>
<P>
"It's somewhat inconvenient, but I understand what they're doing," said John R. 
Polen, the thrift's president. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the restrictions, imposed after regulators rejected the S&amp;L's 
plan to raise the needed cash by early next year, have no major impact on the 
S&amp;L's activities. He said the thrift makes few home loans above $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
The action against San Clemente Savings is part of a larger nationwide 
regulatory effort to restrict operations of S&amp;Ls that do not meet the three 
tough capital tests imposed as part of the law passed by Congress in August to 
rescue the thrift deposit insurance system. 
</P>
<P>
In San Clemente Savings' case, the thrift does not meet one capital test, 
specifically relating to the riskiness of its assets. Polen said the S&amp;L 
needs to come up with more than $2 million in capital to comply with the 
capital rules. The thrift expects to raise the money by the end of June, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente Savings has $12.8 million in capital and easily meets two of the 
three tests, Polen said. But the thrift needs about $15 million in capital to 
comply with the risk-based test, he said. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente Savings, which has $325 million in assets and six branches, has 
built up expertise in loans to small home builders and real estate joint 
ventures, primarily apartment and commercial loans. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators, however, consider those kind of loans and investments to be riskier 
than single-family home lending and require institutions to have more than the 
usual amount of capital, their final reserve against losses. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new thrift law, S&amp;Ls have five years to meet capital standards, 
Polen said. San Clemente Savings submitted a capital plan to the OTS showing 
its intention to meet the so-called risk-based test by early next year. 
</P>
<P>
"But the OTS has developed a policy that says they want the parent company to 
step in and make capital contributions sooner," he said. That is why the 
S&amp;L is seeking a cash infusion from American Pacesetter. 
</P>
<P>
To encourage compliance, OTS limits a thrift's operations, and Polen said the 
restrictions imposed on San Clemente Savings were close to what the S&amp;L was 
doing on its own to raise its risk-based capital level anyway. 
</P>
<P>
He said the S&amp;L already has commitments to sell some of its commercial and 
major apartment investments and loans to raise the needed cash. 
</P>
<P>
American Pacesetter, which consists almost entirely of the S&amp;L, may see its 
profits fall as it works to comply with the order, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly two years ago, the parent firm spun off its profitable Pacesetter Homes 
subsidiary and its Pacesetter Business Properties division to its shareholders.

Reorganizing, Too: Western Digital Corp. is also on the reorganization trail, 
though its moves are a bit less sweeping. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine-based computer-parts company has decentralized some of its 
manufacturing functions. The storage products and microcomputer-products units 
will have their own manufacturing operations. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Roger W. Johnson said the moves will allow "closer coordination with 
our customers from design through production." Some manufacturing functions, 
including large-scale integration for certain chip products and the development 
of new technology, will remain centralized.

AIR/LYON PURCHASES AVIATION ENGINE SUPPLIER

<P>
Air/Lyon Inc., the newly formed holding company that last month acquired Martin 
Aviation, Orange County's oldest flight service company, said Monday it has 
purchased a Northern California aviation engine and engine parts supplier. 
</P>
<P>
David Banmiller, who formed Air/Lyon with Newport Beach developer William Lyon, 
said the acquisition of International Aircraft Support Inc. of Belmont is part 
of the holding company's overall plan to develop a network of aircraft and 
airline service businesses. 
</P>
<P>
International Aircraft specializes in buying and selling or leasing used jet 
engines and selling overhauled engine parts and components, said President Fred 
von Husen. 
</P>
<P>
The deal, whose value was not disclosed, has its roots with another airline 
company. Lyon is the former co-owner and chairman of AirCal, which was sold to 
American Airlines in 1987. Banmiller is the former president of AirCal, and von 
Husen is a former AirCal executive. 
</P>
<P>
Banmiller, who was named chairman of Martin Aviation, will hold the same title 
at International Aircraft, which has approximately $10 million in sales in 
1989. He said the two companies will remain separate entities. 
</P>
<P>
Von Husen said that Air/Lyon will increase International Aircraft's financial 
capabilities and enable it to increase its stock and thus its customer base. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the additional financial strength of Air/Lyon has enabled 
International Aircraft to enter negotiations with a major aviation company for 
a long-term, multiyear engine lease. 
</P>
<P>
Because jet aircraft engine parts are overhauled or replaced at specified 
intervals, the usable life of an engine is indefinite. 
</P>
<P>
Aviation companies typically lease engines to reduce cash expenditures or to 
provide additional supplies when expanding or upgrading their equipment or 
experiencing difficulties in getting their own engines out of their maintenance 
shops, von Husen said. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, International Aircraft has leased engines only on a short-term 
basis, typically a year or less, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The company's principal customers are airlines and aircraft engine overhaulers, 
von Husen said. 
</P>
<P>
International Aircraft currently leases a Boeing 747 engine to Federal Express 
on a short-term lease and has leased engines in the past to United Airlines, 
United Parcel Service, American Airlines, Swissair and Lufthansa. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its headquarters in Belmont, about 20 miles south of San 
Francisco International Airport, International Aircraft also maintains a sales 
office in London. The company has 21 employees.

PFIZER STOCK FALLS ON RUMORS OF WHISTLE-BLOWERS' PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

The stock of Pfizer Inc. fell sharply Monday on rumors that former company 
employees are planning to testify before Congress that the firm tried to cover 
up problems related to heart valves made by Shiley Inc., an Irvine subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
The price of Pfizer stock dropped $2.375 to close at $59.375 in trading on the 
New York Stock Exchange. A spokesman for Pfizer, a giant New York-based 
pharmaceutical company, said there was "no basis" to the allegations of a 
cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
Two heart valve models Shiley manufactured have been the subject of recent 
hearings before Congress. The valves, which are no longer on the market, have 
malfunctioned and have been linked to 272 deaths. More than 85,000 Bjork Shiley 
heart valves of the kinds that have failed were sold between 1979 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Pfizer's stock has been volatile in recent weeks as word circulated that a 
subcommittee chaired by Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Michigan) would release 
derogatory information about the company. In a recent report, the subcommittee 
concluded that Pfizer had failed to maintain acceptable manufacturing and 
safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee also put blame on the Food and Drug Administration for taking 
too long to force the valve off the market, and it criticized Pfizer for 
dragging its feet in reporting incidents of valve failures to the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's stock activity was linked to rumors that Prudential-Bache drug analyst 
Barbara Ryan reported that she had been contacted by an ex-Pfizer employee who 
said a group of former employees planned to provide information about a 
cover-up to a congressional subcommittee investigating the Shiley valve. 
</P>
<P>
The identities of the whistle-blowers rumored to have more information to give 
the subcommittee are apparently not known even to Prudential-Bache, which could 
not be reached Monday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Finzen, a lawyer in the Michigan office of Robins, Kaplan, Miller &amp; 
Ciresi, a law firm representing numerous patients with valve implants who are 
suing Pfizer, said Barbara Dreyfus, an assistant to Ryan, called Monday to ask 
whether he knew who the ex-employees were who had contacted Ryan. He told her 
he did not.

<P>
In a deal that will at least quintuple annual sales, Parker Automotive Corp. 
said Monday that it has signed a five-year, $100-million distribution pact with 
TRW International. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the unit of Cleveland-based TRW Corp. will buy a minimum 
of $20 million of Parker Automotive's pollution-reducing products for internal 
combustion engines, according to Diane Parker, a vice president of the 
3-year-old company. 
</P>
<P>
For its fiscal 1990 year, which ended Feb. 28, Parker Automotive will report 
sales of just under $4 million, Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the distribution agreement, TRW International will import, export, market 
and service Parker Automotive's CarbonClean family of pollution-reducing 
products for internal combustion engines within Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Parker said CarbonClean is a patented system for cleaning gasoline and diesel 
engine fuel systems without dismantling carburetors or fuel injectors. 
</P>
<P>
The system consists of CarbonClean solvents for various types of engines and 
machinery to pump the solvents through the engines. 
</P>
<P>
Users include a number of municipal and regional public transportation 
services, including the Orange County Transit District, as well as more than 
2,000 auto dealership service departments, Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
Parker Automotive, with 50 employees, maintains its headquarters in Costa Mesa 
and has a manufacturing plant in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Parker said the deal with TRW International is a "huge boost" for the company 
and that Parker Automotive currently is negotiating with another major firm for 
a similar exclusive distribution deal in either Asia or South America. 
</P>
<P>
Parker Automotive is 75% owned by members of the Parker family, with the 
remaining shares traded in the over-the-counter market. The stock currently 
sells for about $4.50 a share, Parker said. She said the company has applied to 
be listed on NASDAQ, the National Assn. of Securities Dealers' electronic 
quotation system.

He works in a forest, where the trees are high and the pay is low, but glories

He works in a factory that repairs airplane parts, where precision, not chance, 
is the commanding element of his day. 
</P>
<P>
No bolt slips through, no strut goes by, no wheel assembly passes without his 
personal approval, because safety in the air flies on his unfaltering judgment. 
</P>
<P>
An outdoor worker, an actress and an airplane mechanic, proud of their work, 
eager to do it, anxious to share it. 
</P>
<P>
This is America singing. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Whitman heard it 135 years ago, the songs of carpenters and shoemakers, of 
wood cutters and mechanics, "the varied carols" of people at work that give a 
nation its drive and substance. 
</P>
<P>
I went in search of them specifically for this essay, asking the same question 
of each: Are there rewards beyond money in what they do to make a living? 
</P>
<P>
I studied polls that framed my quest, but polls are bereft of humanity, however 
impressive their often contradictory results. 
</P>
<P>
They told me that most people would keep working even if they didn't have to. 
They told me that Americans ranked occupation low on a satisfaction scale, 
behind family, friends, love and health. 
</P>
<P>
They told me that challenge and a sense of accomplishment are at least as 
important as status, and pride and appreciation as important as money. 
</P>
<P>
Questions asked, numbers compiled, results analyzed. But do the people still 
sing? 
</P>
<P>
Some do, some don't. 
</P>
<P>
Whitman ignored slavery and sweatshops in his verse, and the strife of 
inequality that characterized 19th-Century America. Those who moaned didn't 
sing. 
</P>
<P>
Today, slavery is history. But thousands of Southern Californians still labor 
in sweatshops. And the modern workplace has spawned dilemmas that Whitman could 
not have envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
Electronics have altered the nature of our world, creating new burdens for the 
employee even as they create new profits for the employer. 
</P>
<P>
Computers conflict with quiet human needs. The old ways aren't always best, but 
a stampede toward progress tramples experience and instinct as though they 
never mattered. 
</P>
<P>
As the search goes on for new solutions, old problems persist: the soaring 
costs of education and training, the agonizing necessity to choose between 
money and personal satisfaction, the ferocity of competition, the pain of 
failure and the evils of discrimination in many guises. 
</P>
<P>
But still the people sing. 
</P>
<P>
Allen Armand, 26, working in a state forest, sings of nature as Whitman himself 
did, "aplomb in the midst of irrational things." 
</P>
<P>
Armand left the hectic pace of varied jobs in Los Angeles two years ago for the 
serenity of the north coast redwoods. Today, he draws from his job as park aide 
the satisfaction that he is working to protect an environment that, even in its 
majesty, is at risk. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't preserve it now," he asks, "who will? And when?" 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Dells, an actress in her middle years, sings of the pleasures that 
emerge from the creation of a role and the psychic link that connects her with 
an audience she can't see. 
</P>
<P>
Hers is a quest for pride through perfection that has honed her career on and 
off for 15 years, both as an actress and a student of acting. She works 
steadily in a business that suffers the majority of its practitioners to long 
periods of unemployment, and she bears with equanimity the pain of failure. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to take personal pride in what you do," she says during a quiet day 
on the set of an upcoming ABC movie on the Beach Boys, "because so often that's 
all you have." 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the time you're going out on auditions, giving your all for two 
minutes . . . and never hearing back. That hurts. But you keep at it because 
every once in a while you get a hug from a director who says, 'You were great!' 
And that counts a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Kanke, chief inspector and boss of the overhaul division for Sun Valley's 
Time Aviation, sings of responsibility and the pieces of history that surround 
him in the workplace where he prevails. Parts of DC-3s, the early wonder of 
modern flight, and Boeing 767s, the newest work 
</P>
<P>
horse of the jet age, assume new life in the repair division that Kanke 
oversees. 
</P>
<P>
He's been an airplane mechanic for 25 of his 47 years. He earned his licenses 
by attending night schools even as he worked during the day. In 1970, he was 
named the FAA's Western Region Mechanic of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
A deep sense of contributing is part of why Kanke loves his job. He means 
something. He counts. It's a rare feeling of individual worth in an arena of 
collective achievement. 
</P>
<P>
"One cracked bolt," he says, holding up a defective part, "can mean anything 
from nothing to disaster. It's as critical as the part it holds together." He 
pauses, then adds with a mixture of pride and commitment, "I won't let it get 
by." 
</P>
<P>
Armand, Dells, Kanke. Luck and effort have produced the joy in their music. 
They have adapted to problems of low pay, uncertainty and the relentless 
strains of precision to come to peace with their careers. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone has. 
</P>
<P>
A millwright at General Motors who trained four years for his journeyman card 
despises the uncertainty that haunts America's auto industry, specifically GM's 
Van Nuys plant. 
</P>
<P>
"I like what I do and I like the people," he says, "but there's so much stress 
in not knowing what's going to happen tomorrow. There's no peace in the job. We 
don't even know if this plant is going to be open a month from now." 
</P>
<P>
A young sales clerk in an electronics store longs for something different. 
</P>
<P>
"Selling isn't what I want to do," she says, looking up from the sketch of a 
dress she has designed in her spare moments. 
</P>
<P>
She is sketching when I walk in and is deliberately slow in tearing away from 
it. She's proud of the drawing. She wants me to see it. 
</P>
<P>
"Fashion is what I want to do, but my parents don't like the idea and won't pay 
for the training. I can't afford it on my own. I work here, but it's a second 
choice." 
</P>
<P>
She sighs. "Maybe someday. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
I heard America singing. 
</P>
<P>
I heard a highway worker laugh at the rain. I heard a policeman lecture on 
safety. I heard a taco maker sing his own songs in the back room of a fast-food 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
I sing this essay and the wonder of the worker who sings of himself, however 
brutal his task and impossible his goal. 
</P>
<P>
Their voices rise across the land.

HAS THE TIME COME FOR '80S-ERA GREED TO DROP OFF THE BOARD? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN , TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Roaring '80s -- the decade of ambition, of excess and, yes, of greed -- is 
finally ending. 
</P>
<P>
It is ending a few weeks after the calendar actually turned, and not with a 
bang but with a bankrupt thud: The demise of Drexel Burnham Lambert -- the 
money machine largely responsible for driving junk bond takeover mania -- gives 
the dawn of the decade the feel of a bank vault slamming shut. 
</P>
<P>
These days, a real-life Gordon Gekko -- the supremely glamorous yet corrupt 
investor in the 1987 movie "Wall Street" -- would have a tough time finding 
enough killer deals to keep busy. There is no early '80s, Ronald Reagan-style 
tax cut in the offing to provide a cash bonanza for masses of American 
consumers. And everybody is sick of yuppies. 
</P>
<P>
"The zeitgeist of greed that really defined the 1980s has become shopworn, a 
little tired," said William Schneider, a political analyst at the American 
Enterprise Institute in Washington. "But I don't sense anything new that is 
coming to replace it yet." 
</P>
<P>
For social seers, the big question appears to be: What follows an era of 
indulgence? 
</P>
<P>
Will America's most ambitious graduates become more eclectic, less focused on 
Wall Street and a handful of other platinum-plated professions, more willing to 
experiment? Will manufacturing, for instance, come back into business school 
vogue in time for American industry to stave off the Japanese? Is it possible 
that -- gasp -- idealistic values will come back into fashion? 
</P>
<P>
"The trend we see is that they (students) want to do something for others," 
said Deborah McCoy, director of UC Riverside's Career Service Center. "They 
want to make a meaningful contribution." McCoy, for instance, sees growing 
interest in ethical issues among business students. 
</P>
<P>
That's not surprising, perhaps, in light of the imprisonment of super-rich 
investor Ivan Boesky or the more recent legal difficulties of financial wizard 
Michael Milken. 
</P>
<P>
This much appears certain: The high-powered, high-finance jobs that became 
cultural symbols of the past decade -- and potent lures for a generation of 
graduates -- will be far less plentiful in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Already, the headlines are full of the painful contraction on Wall Street, such 
as last week's notice by Shearson Lehman Hutton that 2,000 employees are about 
to get their walking papers. Many observers believe that in the glamorous and 
wealth-creating investment banking field, the crunch is just beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"The junk bond business is drying up," said George Monahan, director of 
industry studies for the Securities Industry Assn., a trade group. 
</P>
<P>
Phones along Wall Street are ringing off the hook as traders and brokers search 
for more stable employment. Drexel Burnham's collapse has left thousands of 
employees scrambling for jobs and created enormous uncertainty about the future 
of other firms that relied heavily on junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Yet employment prospects in financial services have soured far beyond Wall 
Street. Scandals and huge losses have hurt job prospects at many savings and 
loans, for example. But it is Wall Street, which has lost at least 40,000 jobs 
since 1987, that has suffered the most visible and dramatic decline. 
</P>
<P>
For youthful job seekers, the message is stark: "There's a recognition on Wall 
Street that one can no longer get rich just by getting an MBA and putting in 90 
hours a week," said Joan Zimmerman, executive vice president of GZ Stephens, a 
New York executive search firm that specializes in the financial community. 
</P>
<P>
"Investment banking will go back to the way it was before the 1980s: People 
will have apprenticeships at the start of their careers." 
</P>
<P>
Layoffs also have hit virtually every major brokerage firm, due to the long 
decline in "retail" volume, the stock purchases that individual investors make. 
Some 14,000 retail stockbrokers have lost their jobs since the crash of 
October, 1987, the Securities Industry Assn. reports. And Wall Street still is 
believed to have 25% more employees than it needs. 
</P>
<P>
Even those who retain investment jobs have lost some of the rewards they 
enjoyed at the peak of the opulent '80s. Year-end bonuses for investment 
bankers were down roughly 25% last year. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, one of the few growth areas on Wall Street may come from the need 
to fix the many ailing leveraged buyouts and other junk-laden corporations. 
Many of those who helped put those fragile deals together may find work helping 
the firms straighten out their balance sheets in order to survive the 1990s, 
some recruiters say. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the grim job outlook in the financial services industry hasn't been 
lost on business school students, who understand the laws of supply and demand 
as well as anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"The pipeline is drying up on both sides," said Doyle Lyons, an analyst at 
Merrill Lynch who follows the securities industry. "There is less hiring, and 
fewer MBA students are interested." 
</P>
<P>
At Stanford's Graduate School of Business, for instance, the number of 
graduates taking jobs in investment banking fell from 23% of the Class of 1987 
to 7% of the Class of 1989, according to spokeswoman Cathy Castillo. 
</P>
<P>
"Those that are interested in investment banking are finding good jobs, but 
there are just not as many of them," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is there any one field that students are flocking to instead of investment 
banking. That old standby of business school graduates -- management consulting 
-- remains hot, ranking first among Stanford graduates, with 16% of them taking 
consulting jobs in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In general, students seem to be weighing a more diverse array of possibilities 
than their predecessors did in the go-go 1980s, according to Maureen McNulty, 
director of Stanford's career management center. 
</P>
<P>
"First-year business school students looking for summer jobs are looking at a 
broader range of activities," McNulty said. "Management consulting is still No. 
1, but manufacturing is stronger than it has been." 
</P>
<P>
Careers in real estate investment also seem to be attracting more business 
school students, despite the uneven housing market in Southern California, 
which ranges from sluggish in the San Fernando Valley to brisk in the Antelope 
Valley and the Inland Empire. 
</P>
<P>
The San Fernando Valley Board of Realtors reports that it has attracted more 
than 1,000 new members -- realtors and their associates -- in the last year. 
"We haven't noticed any slowdown at all" in membership, board staffer Susan 
LeRoy said. 'We're getting just as many new applications for membership as we 
were getting before,' " she added. 
</P>
<P>
Yet those realtors are splitting up a smaller pie than existed just a year or 
two ago, and many marginal brokers may not last much longer. In January, 
realtors sold 287 fewer existing houses in the San Fernando Valley than they 
did a year earlier, a 27% decline, and more than 10,000 homes in the region 
remained unsold on the market. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people aren't buying because no one knows where the bottom is in 
Southern California real estate right now," said Alex Auerbach, a spokesman for 
the Los Angeles Board of Realtors, which represents, among other areas, the 
city's affluent Westside. 
</P>
<P>
With so many get-rich professions seemingly not quite as alluring as they once 
were, what is there for a young go-getter to do in the 1990s? 
</P>
<P>
Many erstwhile Wall Streeters will, of course, go into corporate America or 
management consulting. And in a more closely knit global economy, international 
business and entrepreneurship are likely to provide new opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there also are clues that business in general may be losing some of its 
luster among students these days. Interest in business careers among those 
entering college last fall fell to the lowest level since 1983, according to 
the annual survey of college freshmen by UCLA's Higher Education Research 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a growing number of students may be gravitating toward fields that 
reflect non-financial values, such as environmental science and counseling, 
McCoy of UC Riverside maintains. It even seems possible that graduates in the 
1990s will show greater interest in public service, a surprising epitaph to a 
decade that glamorized greed on magazine covers. 
</P>
<P>
Laina Warsavage, a project coordinator for Campus Compact, a group that 
encourages public service work at 230 colleges, said: "I think students are 
seeing other opportunities."

An interest in film-making has been Jeff Reed's hedge against teacher burnout. 
He's been known to splice clips together to make special movies for his history 
class at Huntington Park High School. He runs the school's media center. And in 
January, he inaugurated a course that introduces students themselves to the 
camera, the computer and the editing deck. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to keep growing as a human being and as a professional," said Reed, a 
bearded, informal veteran of 10 years at the blackboard. Otherwise, he said, 
it's all too easy to focus on the drawbacks of his chosen field: "Low pay, 
shoddy treatment, it's all there." 
</P>
<P>
To Reed, a teaching career is "a moral decision. I can be socially productive 
and do something I feel good about." 
</P>
<P>
Teaching jobs are fairly plentiful locally these days. And in the wake of 
recent strikes, along with a national upsurge in interest in education, 
salaries appear to be headed up while school districts cede some control to 
faculty. 
</P>
<P>
But budget crunches are a fact of school life too, and doubters say change must 
come even more rapidly to lure top-notch applicants. In Southern California, 
teacher salaries typically start at between $20,000 and $30,000; wages for the 
most senior, skilled faculty members may peak above $50,000 in top-paying 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
"We've made some progress, especially in entry-level salaries, but the maximum 
salary is not enough and the conditions are still deplorable," said Wayne 
Johnson, president of United Teachers-Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Job market analyst Victor R. Lindquist agreed: "The rate of teachers' pay is 
going to have to escalate at twice the cost of living just to catch up" and 
compete with other fields, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Across the country, "there are shortages right now in certain specialties," 
said Lindquist, author of an annual survey of job opportunities for college 
graduates. "In five years, it's going to be critical." 
</P>
<P>
Many Southern California cities including Los Angeles, Santa Ana and Long Beach 
are experiencing a tremendous growth in numbers of students -- and need for 
teachers -- largely because of the waves of immigrants washing over the area. 
</P>
<P>
School systems are working especially hard to find bilingual, special 
education, math and science teachers. The Los Angeles Unified School District, 
for example, is willing to help bilingual college graduates get certified to 
teach -- while it pays them a $2,500 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana took advantage of a cold spell in the Midwest to send recruiters 
there and planned a March 3 job fair with "contracts offered on the spot," said 
district spokeswoman Diane Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
In many districts, there even is a shortage of substitutes. To try to combat 
that, wages have been raised by as much as 25% over the past year in parts of 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
But a surge in enrollments is not the only reason for a shortage of teachers. 
Low salaries and low prestige, when compared to many other professions, seem to 
have discouraged young people from entering the field. Nationally, bachelor's 
degrees in education decreased from 144,000 in 1977 to 88,000 in 1985, the 
latest year for which figures were available, according to the American Assn. 
of College Teachers of Education. 
</P>
<P>
"Since then, though we don't have the numbers, we have a feeling that they are 
continuing to decline," said Mark Lewis, a research assistant for the 
association. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Reed gets upset when he thinks about the lack of respect for teachers, 
from the world at large, from administrators, even from students who often 
don't seem to try in class. He has felt lost in the system, under-recognized, 
even with changes in the teachers' contract that allow for more faculty 
decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
At 37, as a husband and father of two small boys, he is tired of living in a 
rented house. He teaches two nights a week at a local college in an effort to 
stockpile a down payment for his own place, but "even now it's problematic," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And he calls his $36,000 wage "a financial sacrifice." But it is one he has 
been willing to make for the rewards of teaching. Reed is excited about 
bringing "technological literacy" to his students and helping other teachers to 
use film and illustrations in their classes. 
</P>
<P>
And then there is the sweetness of a perfectly executed lesson. Like the time 
just before Christmas when a class full of ninth-graders who read at the 
third-grade level came alive, discussing one of his film segments. 
</P>
<P>
"We spent the whole hour all talking and arguing about it," Reed said. "The 
timing was such that we finished right when the bell rang. I got 'em going. I 
got 'em hooked." 
</P>
<P>
For the 1990-91 academic year, the Los Angeles district will need to hire 1,600 
to 2,000 teachers, with a steady stream of openings expected in the following 
years, said Michael P. Acosta, who supervises the school system's recruitment 
and assignment of faculty. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Unified, the largest district in Orange County, will hire at least 
350 teachers for the fall -- 17.5% above its 2,000-member work force -- mostly 
due to growth. In the Long Beach Unified School District, with the number of 
students increasing by 2,000 a year, "we too have a tremendous need for 
teachers," said Marietta Palmer, who oversees the system's faculty hiring. 
</P>
<P>
Not every local school system is in such straits. The Santa Monica-Malibu 
Unified School District, for instance, has seen enrollment plummet from 16,000 
students in 1975 to 9,200 today. Still, Assistant Supt. Mark Karadenes said he 
hired 50 teachers this year. 
</P>
<P>
The affluent coastal district is popular with applicants, with 300 hopefuls for 
every opening, Karadenes said. But even that number seems to reflect a decline 
in interest from a decade ago, when each slot attracted 3,000 applicants. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Wayne Johnson, the teachers union president, said he would hesitate to 
advise a college student to enter teaching these days. "My heart tells them to 
get into teaching, because it's the key to our future," he said. "But on a 
personal level, you can do other things. Unless things change dramatically, you 
may find this very frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Reed understands such ambivalence. But when his wife recently told him she 
wanted to leave her bookkeeping work and get a credential for teaching music in 
elementary schools, he encouraged her. "I think it's a good thing," he said. "I 
think she has the calling."

<TEXT>
<P>
Four years ago, Egan L. Badart was a successful, hard-driving real estate 
agent. He lived with his family in a 6,000-square-foot home with a swimming 
pool and an acre of ground in Pasadena. He had assets totaling "a little over 
$2 million." 
</P>
<P>
Then calamity struck. A perforated, cancerous colon incapacitated Badart for 
more than two years. Inexorably, his business and investments slipped away. 
</P>
<P>
He lost it all. The cars, the house, the money -- even his family. 
</P>
<P>
Badart is back on his feet again, but there's something different about him. 
Even though he could use his real estate background to replenish his personal 
fortune, money doesn't mean that much to him anymore. The intensity with which 
he once pursued the real estate business is now channeled into an earlier 
passion that through the years of wealth and success never ceased to haunt him. 
</P>
<P>
Acting. 
</P>
<P>
For many, the road to a middle-age crisis is paved with the manuscripts of 
unfinished novels, molding canvases and moth-eaten ballet slippers, those 
forgotten talismans of a creative urge neglected for the demands of day-to-day 
living. In some cases the creative drive is unflagging and inspires people to 
tailor their lives in accommodation. 
</P>
<P>
But others may stray from their dreams of artistic success (or simply artistic 
survival) to find that it boomerangs back on them. For the seriously creative 
person, denial of that drive can mean big problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The real estate business never made me happy," said Badart, a boyish-looking 
38-year-old with intense brown eyes who goes by the stage name Egan Ryann. "I 
think when you do something that goes against your nature, that when you forget 
to address the needs of your soul, you're going to get sick." 
</P>
<P>
Now Badart lives simply in an eight-by-ten-foot rented room. He works at real 
estate a few days a week to make ends meet, but he drops everything when an 
acting opportunity, such as a meeting with an agent or a casting call, arises. 
He's poorer, he says, but definitely happier. 
</P>
<P>
For some, the creative drive is accompanied by a distinct vision that often 
borders on a sense of mission. Take Maureen Michelson. In 1984, she left the 
relative security of a promising journalism career to start New Sage Press, her 
own publishing company in Pasadena. With eight book titles to her credit, 
Michelson has established her operation as a respected small publishing house. 
</P>
<P>
"I realized that I had a lot of talents and ideas that weren't being expressed 
in the publishing world, and I wasn't willing to work at a job for 30 years 
before I could put some of my ideas into fruition," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The question of money, of course, may rear its ugly head before all who venture 
down the creative road. But Michelson eschews the pursuit of commercial success 
for projects she believes will leave a lasting impression. 
</P>
<P>
These projects often are realized at her own personal expense. "Women and 
Work," for instance, a book of photos and essays featuring women from all walks 
of life, made the American Library Assn.'s 1987 list of "Best Books for Young 
Adults." 
</P>
<P>
Michelson admits to cutting profit margins by upgrading the quality of paper 
and photo reproduction, while still keeping her products affordable to most. 
</P>
<P>
"Somewhere in my late 20s I decided that having a good paycheck and being in a 
prestigious place wasn't enough," she said. "There was an inner need that had 
to be filled. I didn't want to get stuck in a niche with a steady paycheck." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, she isn't alone. These days an increasing number of people are 
contemplating a return to their early, creative aspirations, some experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"As baby boomers are coming into middle age, they're asking the classic 
question, 'What's it all about?' and, 'Did I make the right choice?' said Dr. 
Carole Lieberman, assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at UCLA. "They're 
often looking for things that are less traditional, such as taking different 
time schedules, or turning a hobby into a skill that they can use on a new job. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, it's something they always wanted to do when they were younger -- 
that they abandoned for something more lucrative. And then something gives them 
the courage to go back to that original idea." 
</P>
<P>
But what about those bouts of bill-induced insomnia, those dark nights of the 
soul when the pinstripe suit, buried in mothballs, calls out fondly, and the 
rugged individualist is sorely tempted to seek security in the nearest 
corporate headquarters -- any corporate headquarters? 
</P>
<P>
"I only have those thoughts about 23 times a week," joked novelist Harriet 
Katz, a political activist and former public information director for the 
American Civil Liberties Union. Katz became a full-time novelist in 1982 and 
has written five novels since then. One of them, "Ambitions," was published in 
1986. "I have a fear of meaningless work," she said. 
</P>
<P>
It's not necessarily an all-or-nothing proposition, however. For Katz, who is 
now ready to return to the work force, a steady job can have its own emotional 
rewards, not the least of which is the security that goes with a steady 
paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
"There were times when I was definitely taking a financial risk, in terms of 
deciding to live on savings instead of working at a full-time job," she said. 
"Of course, I hoped that the writing would have some financial results, which 
in one case it did." 
</P>
<P>
Even those who are already successful in a creative pursuit often come to a 
fork in the road where a choice must be made between commercial success and 
artistic fulfillment. 
</P>
<P>
Dancer and choreographer Lula Washington was working steadily in film, 
television and in Las Vegas stage shows before she founded Lula Washington's 
Contemporary Dance Theatre in 1980. Since then she and her husband, Irwin 
Washington, have mortgaged their house to pay for the studio. She regularly 
puts in 60-hour weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"The money (in commercial dance) was good, no doubt, but it wasn't what I 
really wanted to do. I started the company as a way of providing opportunities 
for other black choreographers. Now I have a lot more control over my life and 
over the artistic end of what I want to do." 
</P>
<P>
To continue that pursuit, Washington recently passed on a full-time job at Cal 
State Los Angeles, where she teaches part time. 
</P>
<P>
"I love teaching, but I felt that it would take away from my time as an 
artist," she said. "I've always felt that my biggest contribution to the 
community is my creativity."

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Computer pioneer Seymour Cray had exercised the power and perquisites of a 
corporate chief executive for nine years when he took a step that summed up how 
he felt about the job. 
</P>
<P>
He picked somebody else to be CEO of Cray Research. And then he went back to 
full-time work in the lab. "He knew everything he wanted to know about 
administration, and it wasn't for him," said Donald Hambrick, a professor at 
Columbia University School of Business. 
</P>
<P>
Cray, a reclusive genius who is sometimes called the Thomas Edison of the 
supercomputer, was anything but the average chief executive. But abdication 
contains a grain of wisdom about the limitations of a job that for so many is 
the goal of a lifetime's striving. 
</P>
<P>
Life at the top offers status, the power to shape major change, and often an 
exhilarating opportunity to move among other powerful and influential people. 
Needless to say, it also usually offers perquisites and enormous pay; such 
packages may exceed $1 million at large companies. What's more, compensation 
for chief executives has been rising faster than for almost any other job in 
American life, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
But there are complications that also make the jobs anguishing. By definition, 
the decisions that land on the chief executive's desk are the most difficult at 
the corporation. 
</P>
<P>
The top boss is buffeted by many forces outside his control: government, 
competitive market forces, Wall Street. Inside the company, the leader may 
symbolize painful decisions such as laying off workers. And, as Cray concluded, 
with its administrative duties and demanding constituencies, the job doesn't 
offer the freedom of posts that are further down the organizational ladder. 
</P>
<P>
William Ouchi, UCLA professor of management and strategic studies, says the 
CEO's single most important job is laying down a long-term strategic plan and 
risking the corporate resources to make sure the company can carry it out. 
Should the company sell off parts of its businesses, borrow heavily to buy 
other operations, adopt new technologies? 
</P>
<P>
"No amount of staff work can come up with a 'right' answer to these big 
questions," said Ouchi. "The chief executive has got to listen to everybody 
else's advice and then, alone, make the right choice." 
</P>
<P>
Chief executives say these choices are often the most difficult, and rewarding, 
parts of their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Robert R. Dockson, the chief executive of California Federal Savings from 1973 
to 1985, recalls the wrenching strategic shift he oversaw in the early 1980s. 
In 1981, with interest rates at 20% and the S&amp;L carrying a huge portfolio 
of low-yielding fixed rate mortgages, CalFed lost $51 million. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later Dockson took the company public, raising $400 million and 
launching a diversification that has increased the company's assets from $7.5 
billion to $26 billion over the course of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
"It puts tremendous strain on a man to have to look ahead, form a long-term 
plan and then try to stick to it," said Dockson, 72, who was CalFed chairman 
until August, 1988. "Board members will ask, 'Are we going the right way?' And 
they should ask." 
</P>
<P>
Like so many other S&amp;Ls, CalFed is still in the midst of a difficult 
adjustment to changes in the industry and government rules. But Dockson 
considers directing the company's growth one of the most satisfying parts of 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
The frustrations that chief executives feel from powerful external forces are 
illustrated in a dilemma that William Leonhard faced early in his tenure as 
chief executive of Parsons Co. 
</P>
<P>
After the death of founder Ralph Parsons in 1974, a parade of suitors trooped 
through Leonhard's office with offers to buy the big Pasadena engineering 
company. But none of the offers was nearly what Leonhard thought the company 
was worth; the cyclic nature of the construction business has kept the stock 
market from fairly valuing engneering companies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than sell out, Leonhard helped arrange for an employee trust to buy a 
24% stake in 1974. In 1984 -- after one approach by a hostile bidder -- the 
8,500 employees bought the remainder. 
</P>
<P>
Private employee ownership has increased employees' satisfaction, Leonhard 
believes, and has also eliminated the need to satisfy Wall Street's pressure 
for constant improvement in quarterly profits. "The pressure from Wall Street 
did put a little strain on management," said Leonhard, who is due to retire in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
While corporate strivers dream of the chief executive's power, "once you get 
into the job, you get preoccupied with the outside pressures that are keeping 
you from doing what you want," said James O'Toole, a management professor at 
USC. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a gain in power may be accompanied by a loss of freedom. Harry G. 
Bubb was chief executive of Pacific Mutual Life Insurance from 1986 until the 
end of last year, during a decade in which the life insurance business 
underwent sweeping changes in the products it offered and the technology it 
used. 
</P>
<P>
While Bubb found that overseeing the shift was highly rewarding, he said he 
sometimes believes the best job he ever had was when he was the 28-year-old 
supervisor of the company's regional office in Dallas, charged with producing 
business in a five-state region. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a maximum degree of freedom, and a minimum of reporting to others," he 
recalled. "Maybe I was too young to know how good it was." 
</P>
<P>
Another source of strain for CEOs is the unrelenting scrutiny of Wall Street 
analysts, shareholders and the press on their personal performance. Columbia 
University's Hambrick recalled how recently a chief executive left his 
shirttail hanging during a presentation to analysts -- and had it written up in 
an analyst's report. 
</P>
<P>
"In this job you've got to speak your piece without stuttering, or taking a 
moment to think," Hambrick said. "And if you don't show up, they'll say you're 
hiding out." 
</P>
<P>
Many chief executives consider the task of laying off employees one of the most 
painful parts of their job. 
</P>
<P>
It's painful, in part, because employees may blame the CEO personally for the 
misfortune the corporation has inflicted on them. This attitude was reflected 
in the film "Roger and Me," about General Motors Chairman Roger B. Smith and 
his role in the huge layoffs at GM's Flint, Mich., plant. 
</P>
<P>
The sacrifice of time at home is another obvious but serious drawback of the 
job, CEOs say. "I wasn't on hand at more than one graduation for all of my five 
kids," lamented Bubb of Pacific Mutual. 
</P>
<P>
But top executives have learned that such losses go with the territory. Asked 
if he would limit his working hours if he had it to do over, Leonhard of 
Parsons responded: "I'm not sure it's in my nature."

REPORTS FORM THE FIELD;

<P>
AND THE WINNER IS. . .AN ACCOUNTANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Cruise doesn't know. Dustin Hoffman doesn't know. Meryl Streep doesn't 
know. 
</P>
<P>
But accountant Frank Johnson will know who has won this year's Academy Awards 
two days before he strides onstage with a fistful of sealed envelopes later 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, the partner in charge of Price Waterhouse's entertainment group, has 
been the accountant responsible for tallying the Oscar ballots for the last 14 
years. He and a single colleague are the only two people with advance 
information of just what names will be inside the envelopes they hand to the 
tuxedo- and evening gown-garbed celebrity presenters who will announce the 
results to a worldwide TV audience. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of fun to know a secret the rest of the world wants to know," 
Johnson said. "And since my wife and I are movie fans, this job is particularly 
enjoyable." 
</P>
<P>
To outsiders, the life of an accountant may seem exceedingly dull. Branded as 
"bean counters," accountants are generally known for slogging through page 
after page of numbers, not for hobnobbing with public figures. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the stereotype can be deceiving. While some accountants specialize in tax 
preparation or estate planning, others monitor the goings on at breweries, 
banks or major league baseball stadiums. Accountants also play key, 
behind-the-scenes roles in law enforcement and in private investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Valued for their broad financial experience and intimate knowledge of the firms 
they advise, they even are picked sometimes to run well-known American 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Take Chuck Schmidt, a former certified public accountant appointed chief 
executive of the Detroit Lions football team early this year. "For all those 
bean counters out there," he told reporters, "I want to say, 'Yo, we made it.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
More typical, of course, are accountants who spend their time checking the 
accuracy of financial records. A boring pursuit? Well, it can occasionally lead 
them to places off limits to the public. In Las Vegas, Steve Comer supervises 
chip counting -- not bean counting -- at casinos, including Caesars Palace and 
Circus Circus. 
</P>
<P>
"We're required to go through cash counts in the cages where all the money is . 
. . to determine that the company has followed good procedures and is complying 
with state regulations," said Comer, a partner in charge of the Las Vegas 
office of Arthur Andersen and Co. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, not all accountants sit behind the same desk for decades. With the 
increasingly international flavor of business, employees of leading accounting 
firms are dispatched to locales as far off as Tokyo and Paris to inspect 
factories or examine ledgers. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the ultimate field work for accountants takes place on American shores. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,250 FBI special agents -- roughly one-eighth of the bureau's field 
staff of agents -- hold accounting degrees. 
</P>
<P>
"Historically, we like accountants and attorneys," said FBI spokesman Fred 
Reagan. "That's been true since the FBI was established. . . . They're hired as 
regular agents and their lives sometimes become more exciting than that of the 
general CPA." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to pens and calculators, Reagan explained, "they carry a badge, a 
sidearm and handcuffs." 
</P>
<P>
With the mushrooming national savings and loan scandal, the FBI recently 
received authorization to hire 150 additional agents with accounting degrees. 
The annual starting pay is $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
In general, starting pay for accountants at medium and large public accounting 
firms begins at about $25,000 nationwide, according to a 1990 salary survey by 
Robert Half International Inc. The U.S. Department of Labor estimates there are 
945,000 accounting and auditing jobs in the nation, about one-third held by 
CPAs. 
</P>
<P>
"You make a good living and you move along at a fairly good pace," said Avedick 
Poladian, managing partner for the Arthur Andersen office in Los Angeles. "It 
also offers people at a fairly young age the opportunity to take on a good 
amount of responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
"We principally hire people right out of college with undergraduate degrees in 
accounting," he continued. "The attrition rate in public accounting is fairly 
high. A lot of people get offers from their clients because they demonstrate 
strong expertise, so they get snatched up. . . . The good news is we have a 
strong alumni network, which in many cases is our best source of new business." 
</P>
<P>
Merton Alperin, a longtime CPA and member of the Massachusetts State Board of 
Accountancy, acknowledges that "a lot of (accounting) is drudge work, don't kid 
yourself." 
</P>
<P>
But he adds that the profession is generally more people-oriented than the 
public might realize. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a business where you have a lot of human relationships. You're dealing 
with people all the time. . . . You become a psychiatrist and a psychologist 
with certain clients. . . . They call the doctor if they are sick, but 
otherwise they call their accountants. He's the business confidante . . . part 
of the team." 
</P>
<P>
While accounting may never boast the sex appeal of some professions -- after 
all, there is no discernible public demand for a TV series called "L.A. 
Accounting" -- the field appears to be one that is less tainted than many in 
regard to such issues as trust and respect. 
</P>
<P>
One factor may be the annual Academy Awards broadcast, where presenters 
painstakingly point out the strict secrecy employed by Price Waterhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, six accountants help count the ballots that members of the Academy 
of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences have mailed in. Johnson and an associate 
summarize the final tallies. On awards night, the pair carry separate stacks of 
envelopes to the ceremony, in case one of them gets delayed for an unforeseen 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
And Johnson guarantees this: The winners' names do not leak. "It's part of our 
work to keep confidences and hold inside information secure. The ability to 
keep a secret and manage the process without any hitch for so many years is 
good for the business."

JOB FAIR: WHEN DREAMS COLLIDE WITH REALITY

Los Angeles Police Sgt. Joseph Peyton was looking for a few good rookies. So on 
a San Mateo recruiting drive, he tried to lure new officers with the rewards of 
police work: the chance to perform a vital public service, the excitement of 
apprehending criminals. 
</P>
<P>
But Peyton was outgunned by a rival who drew bigger crowds. "The (Drug 
Enforcement Administration) had this gimmick -- a robot-like Ninja warrior 
moving up and down," he recalled laughingly. "All we had were four officers." 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the job fair, the awkward ritual where prospective employers and 
employees get acquainted, usually on college campuses. Both sides say the 
encounter is revealing, if not a downright collision of expectations. 
Recruiters say many students want more money at the entry level than employers 
are willing to pay. And students say they sometimes find the demands of 
would-be employers to be a little, well, unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent blustery day at USC, about 3,000 students visited representatives 
of 135 fields, including high technology, entertainment, financial services, 
retailing and law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Charles M. Hedgepeth, 23, a USC senior majoring in public administration, 
discovered that the hard realities of the working world were somewhat different 
from what he'd hoped. 
</P>
<P>
"Nordstrom is entry-level only," complained Hedgepeth, who spent $700 for his 
job interview wardrobe. "And May Co.? They want a 3.0 grade average. . . . It's 
ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
What sort of money should college graduates expect for their first professional 
job? Depending on the field, holders of bachelor's degrees generally start out 
at $20,000 up to the low $30,000s, according to national surveys by the College 
Placement Council, an association of employers and colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Petroleum and chemical engineers, for instance, start out at an average of 
$33,000, whereas health care workers typically start at $20,000 to $25,000. 
(Salaries in high-cost regions, such as Southern California, may be higher.) 
</P>
<P>
Highest starting pay outside technical fields goes to students entering the 
investment banking field, with offers typically in the mid-$20,000s or higher, 
the placement council reports. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprising, "financial services have continued to be a pretty big draw (for 
students) as well as communications, tech-oriented companies and, of course, 
the more glamorous ones, entertainment," said Stephen Cheney-Rice, assistant 
director of USC's Career Development Center. 
</P>
<P>
Asked for popular career choices among UCLA undergraduates, Joyce Haraughty, a 
career development employee there, cited advertising, accounting, management, 
real estate and government. 
</P>
<P>
While some fields are perennially popular, other aspects of the career search 
are changing. Consider preparation: Increasingly at local universities, 
preparing for the job hunt is serious business. At UCLA, counselors are 
available to help students prepare their resumes and fine-tune their job 
interview techniques, Haraughty said. 
</P>
<P>
Such practice can help, counselors say. During a typical two-hour mock 
interview at USC's career development center, counselors pretend they are 
employers; the episode is videotaped to help improve the student's performance. 
</P>
<P>
One tape revealed that a "young lady's leg would accelerate -- jumping up and 
down out of nervousness -- whenever she had to answer a question," Cheney-Rice 
recalled. " . . . a mile a minute that leg was going. That's the kind of thing 
that can be found by video playback." 
</P>
<P>
All the preparing, it seems, can create student-experts in workplace issues -- 
even among students who have little firsthand knowledge of the working world. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to know about retirement, pension benefits, opportunities," said 
LAPD's Peyton. "They are going to grill you, and you'd better be prepared." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Houser, who directs the USC career center, agrees: "Students say, 'I'm 
going to check out a company and if they don't come through with their 
promises, I'm going to get out of here.' That's a big switch from the early 
'70s." 
</P>
<P>
Tim Briggs, a recruiter for the Broadway department store chain, noted another 
aspect of the tough attitude among students he has met lately: They state 
exactly what they want the company to do for them. 
</P>
<P>
"No long-term commitment," he said. "Students tell us that they are looking to 
get a job, get experience and move on to other companies. Students are more up 
front about their wants, to work and move on." 
</P>
<P>
Listen to Gunner Chapman, 23, a public administration major and one of the 
thousands of USC students at the career fair: "Ideally I'd like to start with 
big companies for training and experience and then go off on my own or a 
smaller company. Larger companies tend to stifle growth. Atmosphere is very 
important. I don't want it too rigid, like engineers, or too loose like 
sales-oriented jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Are such expectations excessive? Not at all, declared Sally Peinado, 21, a USC 
communications major. 
</P>
<P>
Peinado said she wants to know about a firm's training programs, its 
recruitment policies and, "How do they assess my wants as well as theirs. . . . 
You have every right asking the company what they can offer you. I'm not 
afraid. I want to know what they have to offer me."

LEARNING A TRADE WITHOUT COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

After graduating from high school in his native Canada, Chris Pepper took a few 
college courses and "did a little bit of everything" to make a living, 
including working for his father making contact lenses. When Pepper finally 
decided on a career, he didn't want to take the time to go to college. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said recently, he enrolled in a program of mainframe computer 
operations and management at Computer Learning Center in Los Angeles -- a 
for-profit trade school. Five years after completing the program, he is a 
senior manager at Errico Technologies, a Los Angeles software research and 
development company recently purchased by Price Waterhouse. 
</P>
<P>
The American workplace is changing rapidly -- increasingly requiring 
better-educated workers but not necessarily college-educated workers. The route 
to high-paying jobs taken in years past by high school graduates -- assembly 
line work in heavy industry -- isn't much of an option today. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, technology has taken on greater importance, creating 
opportunity for those who can operate computers and sophisticated machinery, 
and for those who can read well and comprehend instructions. 
</P>
<P>
Computer operators and technicians in health care and other fields are examples 
of plentiful jobs that do not require a four-year college degree. The best of 
these jobs do require, however, a willingness to spend a couple of years in 
community college or a few months in a trade school. 
</P>
<P>
Some industries and many labor unions also offer on-the-job apprenticeship 
programs. Many electricians, for example, entered the profession through 
apprenticeships. Southern California Edison fills many vacancies in skilled 
areas from entry-level workers who have been placed in an in-house training 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge for students looking at for-profit trade schools is to determine 
which will be useful and which are "diploma mills," primarily in the business 
of collecting tuition rather than dispensing education. 
</P>
<P>
"Reputable schools will want to provide information on attrition rates, 
graduation rates and provide references," said Dan Parker, spokesman for the 
California Student Aid Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Another tip: Ask companies in the industry you want to work in, 'Do you hire 
graduates from XYZ school?' " Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
For those who gain the skills, job opportunities await. Many computer operators 
are starting at $23,000 a year, said Richard Perry, a Thrifty Drugs computer 
operator, who graduated from Computer Learning Center last September. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, health care is aching for a variety of workers, said Kathy Barry, 
director of the Health Careers Information Center. The center was established 
by the Hospital Council of Southern California to cope with labor shortages in 
various positions, including many that require a year or two of specialized 
training. 
</P>
<P>
The center has a public information program to make prospective workers aware 
of job requirements. "Our goal is to increase the supply of workers for our 
hospitals by encouraging people to enter health care professions," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Radiologic technicians and medical records technicians are among the most 
difficult health care positions to fill, Barry said. Employers generally hire 
radiologic technicians who have completed a community college program, she 
said, but some hospitals train their own. 
</P>
<P>
A beginning technologist in Southern California will make about $11.50 an hour, 
Barry said. But a radiologic technologist trained in a specialty -- such as 
ultrasound technology -- will begin at a higher salary, she said. A community 
college-trained medical records technician will start at about $10 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the health care industry has a critical need for laboratory assistants 
and technicians, and medical assistants to help doctors and nurses perform 
patient tests, review medical records and report changes in patient vital 
signs, said Judi Hansen, director of regional recruitment services for Kaiser 
Permanente, the large health maintenance organization. 
</P>
<P>
Entry-level salaries for medical assistants range from $17,600 a year to 
$20,800, she said; entry-level salaries for laboratory assistants and 
technicians range from about $17,000 to $23,000. 
</P>
<P>
To help increase the supply of nurses, the information center has referred many 
prospects to County-USC Medical Center, which operates the only remaining 
hospital-based diploma program for registered nurses west of the Rockies. The 
two-year program is similar to nursing associate degree programs at numerous 
Southern California community colleges, said program director Marilyn Grafton. 
Students must be residents of Los Angeles County or a neighboring county. 
</P>
<P>
The major difference between RNs trained in two-year programs and those with 
four-year college degrees is in the opportunities to advance into management, 
Barry and Grafton said. "You need a BA to be a head nurse. Generally, a 
master's degree is required to be head administrator," Barry said.

BUILDING A CAREER IN CONSTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOYCE SUNILA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California's booming construction industry has made it a magnet for 
workers in the building trades. Those who can perform expert plumbing, 
carpentry and electrical work are in demand and can carve out secure, lucrative 
careers for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
In all three fields, unions have helped wages and benefits keep pace with 
inflation. Annual salaries for journeymen range from $30,000 to $60,000. Those 
with no experience can advance rapidly through union apprenticeship programs, 
starting at $6 to $8 an hour and reaching journeyman's level in four to five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Joining a union can have advantages -- including health benefits and grievance 
procedures in the event of a dispute -- but it is not necessary. Many shops and 
construction sites offer on-the-job training, and some pay at union levels. 
Others pay less and may offer fewer benefits. (Nationally, more than 
three-fourths of construction work is non-union, according to the U.S. 
Department of Labor.) 
</P>
<P>
In all three trades, dedication can pay off. Go-getters willing to acquire 
extra schooling and work long hours can become foremen and supervisors. Such 
jobs can carry six-figure salaries. 
</P>
<P>
A brisk expansion of the plumbing industry in Southern California has made it 
easier for aspiring plumbers to land spots as apprentices, said John Hall, a 
business representative for the Plumbers Union Local 78 in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
While learning the trade, a man or woman with a high school education and no 
experience can start off at about $6 an hour. Apprentices who are willing to 
attend school two nights a week on top of their full-time jobs can build the 
expertise that leads to a journeyman's license after five years and a 
guaranteed wage of about $22 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Journeyman plumbers may choose to develop more expertise, which can carry even 
higher wages. After Hall got his journeyman's license, he worked for 13 years 
as a plumber and continued to attend classes, learning to do specialized work 
in laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, Hall became a certified stainless steel welder and an expert in 
computerized welding. Eventually, he became a general foreman. Working seven 
days a week, 12 hours a day for a year and a half, Hall said he was making 
$120,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
A career can also be built from on-the-job training without membership in a 
union. Buddy Gohn, general manager of Jack Stephan Plumbing in Los Angeles, 
said his company is "always looking for apprentices. We advertise in newspapers 
for guys with mechanical ability to come in and start with us at $275 a week. 
After 10 years they can be making $60,000 a year." 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Murphy, 26, of El Segundo responded to one of those ads six months ago 
and is happy with his progress. In his previous job as a technical illustrator 
for Hughes Aircraft, Murphy made about $20,000 and felt he had no chance for 
career advancement. In his new job, he sees a future. 
</P>
<P>
"There's room for growth based on drive and willingness to work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California's lively building industry also offers many job 
opportunities to aspiring electricians, said Harvey Bachand, an organizer at 
the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. And a shortage of skilled 
electricians has made union membership easier to obtain, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The electricians' union offers a five-year apprenticeship program with starting 
wages of more than $8 an hour. It is open to high school graduates who are at 
least 18 years old and who completed a year of algebra with at least a C 
average. Apprentices work 40-hour weeks and attend school two nights a week. 
After six months, their pay rises to more than $9 an hour. Annual increments 
after that lead to journeyman's wages of about $24 an hour -- about $47,500 
annually, based on a 40-hour-a-week, 50-week year. 
</P>
<P>
But those wages are not guaranteed throughout the industry. Construction sites 
usually pay more because most are controlled by union wage rules, but repair 
shops are largely non-union. Repair shops pay a percentage of what the shop 
charges the customer. Hourly wages average $14 to $18, considerably below union 
scale. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Fulton, an electrician with nine years experience, recently began work at 
Ranier Electric &amp; Service Co. in Los Angeles for $30,000 a year. Fulton, 
who is completing a two-year degree in electrical engineering, was unable to 
rise above that ceiling, so he took a job calculating estimates for electrical 
work instead. He expects to make $40,000 in his first year. 
</P>
<P>
Although work on construction sites may pay more, it is not as steady, because 
it is seasonal. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is that the average plumber or electrician makes closer to $35,000 a 
year, even working union rates," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
As in plumbing added expertise in electrician work can pad a paycheck. There 
are many areas of specialization, particularly in the computer and 
telecommunications fields. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if construction slows down, there will always be a demand for the highly 
skilled people," Bachand said. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenters also are enjoying big demand. The field is divided into two areas: 
carpenters, who construct the buildings, and cabinetmakers, who do the 
finishing work inside. Each field has its own union and apprenticeship 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
The two carpenters' unions offer four-year programs with hourly pay starting at 
$8 and rising to nearly $22 for journeymen. The cabinetmakers' union offers a 
four-year program, too, with entry level pay at about $5.50 an hour. Six-month 
increments lead to a top rate of about $14 an hour. Rates are generally a 
little lower in counties south of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Those considering careers in the building trades must also consider, however, 
that if the pace of construction slows, the fields could become glutted with 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
But Hall predicted that demand for manpower locally could double by the 
mid-1990s and will provide many opportunities for plumbers, electricians and 
carpenters willing to "keep ahead of the pack" with extra schooling, especially 
women and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good time to break in," he said.

'ANNIE GET YOUR GUN' CAST CREATES HAPPY SOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Yorba Linda Civic Light Opera's production of "Annie Get Your Gun" has some 
good things going for it -- principally the wonderful songs of Irving Berlin. 
Eminently hummable and spiced with genteel wit, they undoubtedly go home in the 
hearts and on the lips of every listener. And the Yorba Linda cast, along with 
musical director Joel Pressman, create a solid, happy sound throughout. 
</P>
<P>
John LaLonde, as Frank Butler, does musical justice with his rich, expressive 
voice to such tunes as "The Girl That I Marry" and "They Say It's Wonderful." 
And Linda Lebel, as Annie Oakley, pounds out her numbers with gusto. "You Can't 
Get a Man With a Gun" is a great song, and she sings it so's you listen. 
</P>
<P>
It's a shame that the orchestration is recorded, though. For one thing, many of 
the numbers felt rushed and breathless as a result, and beyond that, good music 
deserves live accompaniment. This show in particular, being so much about show 
business (as in, "There's No Business Like . . ."), suffers from canned music. 
Even a small ensemble would enhance the traveling-show atmosphere around which 
this story revolves. 
</P>
<P>
The story is still a good one. Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show pulls into town 
with a challenge to all comers to outshoot glamorous star rifleman Frank 
Butler. Who should best him but a dusty, illiterate little backwoods 
firecracker named Annie Oakley? Opposites attract, and Annie does all she can 
to become the soft, pink girl of Frank's dreams. But how can the slick ladies' 
man and the no-nonsense, home-grown Annie find happiness together when he wants 
to be the world's greatest sharpshooter, and she is? 
</P>
<P>
 LaLonde and Lebel look the parts: He really is drop-jaw handsome, and she's a 
solid, honest piece of womanhood. There's even a hope of genuine sparks between 
them when they sing "Anything You Can Do," an anthem to the battle of the 
sexes. 
</P>
<P>
Director Gary Gordon seems to want laughs. He would have achieved many more if 
he had focused on Annie and Frank's relationship, with all its passion and 
surprises, rather than playing everything as a setup and a punch line. 
</P>
<P>
Within that tone, however, Jim Driskill as Chief Sitting Bull is a particular 
hit with the audience, and Billy Beadle as show-biz huckster Charlie Davenport 
is picture perfect. Rob Hulings, who also choreographed, brings welcome panache 
to his cameo as a manly Indian brave. But it's the little Oakleys who really 
charm. Jared Pfeifer, Allison Harned, Emily Benson, and Marlena Rice are 
delightful. The rest of the cast could take a note from them: Play a little 
more, perform a little less. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yorba Linda Civic Light Opera's production of "Annie Get Your Gun" 
continues through Sunday at the Yorba Linda Forum, 4175 Fairmont Blvd., Yorba 
Linda. Curtain: Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 p.m. Tickets: $8 to 
$10. Information: (714) 779-8591.

FEDERAL FUNDING OF CONTROVERSIAL ARTWORKS IS APPLAUDED AND CRITICIZED; 
</P>
<P>
ART: 'CREATIVITY WILL BE THE CURRENCY OF THE 21ST CENTURY,' NEA CHIEF 
FROHNMAYER DECLARES AT HOUSE SUBCOMMITTTEE HEARING AT GETTY MUSEUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Declaring that "creativity will be the currency of the 21st Century," the 
chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts said Monday it is appropriate 
for the federal government to fund potentially offensive artworks. 
</P>
<P>
John E. Frohnmayer, the NEA chairman, made the remarks before a hearing 
conducted by the postsecondary education subcommittee of the House Education 
and Labor Committee. The subcommittee will originate a bill this year to extend 
the arts endowment's legislative life for another five years. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing -- the first of a series scheduled in the House and Senate this 
year on bills to renew the NEA's legislative mandate -- was held at the J. Paul 
Getty Museum in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer's personal affirmation of federal funding for artworks that may be 
perceived by some as offensive came in response to a question by Rep. Pat 
Williams (D-Mont.), the subcommittee chairman. The remark appeared to coincide 
with an effort by Frohnmayer to begin making a public stand against attempts by 
conservatives in Congress to force the NEA to employ standards specifying 
appropriate subject matter and artistic approach for federally funded creative 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
"Every society needs its artists; they are its watchers, its critics, its 
champions," Frohnmayer said in his testimony. "It is a commentary on the 
strength and wisdom of a government which supports the arts without content 
restraints." 
</P>
<P>
Endowment observers said Frohnmayer's testimony appeared to signal a 
strengthening of the NEA chairman's resolve to publicly battle challenges to 
the NEA's artistic independence. It came at a hearing punctuated by 
demonstrations outside the hearing room on behalf of both arts advocates who 
oppose clamping restrictions on art the NEA can support and conservative 
demonstrators demanding that it be required to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Artists and supporters of the agency clashed with a group opposed to federal 
arts support. Outside the hearing, during a press conference by a group calling 
itself Taxpayers for Accountability for Government (TAG), artists and 
supporters shouted down conservatives holding the press conference as they 
tried to read prepared statements. 
</P>
<P>
JoEllen Allen, president of Eagle Forum, a national group that advocates 
traditional values, said the organization supports elimination of the NEA. 
"Eliminating federal funding of the NEA would save taxpayers over $171 million 
in 1990 and end the escalating controversy concerning whether guidelines should 
be established for federally subsidized art." 
</P>
<P>
Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, chairman of the Anaheim-based Traditional Values 
Coalition and one of the organizers of the new TAG group, complained that the 
format of the hearing excluded NEA opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Blair, who identified himself as an independent Christian, said, "I have 
never been so deeply offended as I am" by the thought of an NEA-supported 
photograph of a crucifix immersed in urine that became one of the rallying 
points of heated debate last year over funding for the arts agency. But as 
Blair spoke, artists demonstrating nearby nearly drowned out the conservative 
speakers with chants of "Shame! Shame!" and "Art is not a crime." 
</P>
<P>
Conservative demonstrators, carrying picket signs denouncing "obscene" art, 
clashed visually with artists staging an advocacy demonstration with the same 
signs many carried last week in a march on the downtown Los Angeles Federal 
Building at which 27 artists and arts supporters were arrested. The march was 
the first of several public events in Southern California in the last few days 
that underscored the volatility of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Early Monday morning, arts supporters suspended banners supporting artistic 
freedom from freeway overpasses as far south as downtown Santa Monica. "Stop 
Censorship Now" signs were stapled to telephone poles along several miles of 
Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Getty Museum director John Walsh, who is also president of the Assn. of Art 
Museum Directors, a national group representing the nation's largest museums, 
urged the Williams subcommittee to ward off an attack by a small group of 
legislators, saying that the chilling of free expression initiated by any 
clampdown on content of publicly supported art is "a price too high for a free 
society to pay." 
</P>
<P>
The audience, which remained orderly throughout the hearing, included a broad 
variety of people, from Sheldon to Los Angeles video artist Sheree Rose and 
comedian Bob Flanagan. Rose and Flanagan, who work together, were among nine 
West Coast artists named in a letter to the NEA from Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) 
late last year that demanded information on endowment support of specific arts 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
Artist organizations and individual artists named in the Helms letter have 
contended the conservative senator's correspondence was intended to intimidate 
artists working in controversial media and subject matter. Rose and Flanagan's 
work focuses on sadomasochism and visually depicts such practices as piercing 
of the genital organs. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's hearing, Frohnmayer noted that the NEA has undergone legislative 
reauthorization six times before during its 25-year history. On each occasion, 
Frohnmayer noted, a debate of some sort has materialized over whether the 
government should restrict the kinds of artworks that may be paid for with 
federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer recalled that when the arts endowment was created in 1965, 
legislators underscored a series of fears that it might become the equivalent 
of the ministries of culture in communist countries -- forcing the content of 
art to conform to political dictates. 
</P>
<P>
"For 25 years this agency has not fulfilled that dire warning," Frohnmayer 
said. "And it should not do so now. The heart and soul of the arts is 
creativity, and promotion of that creativity is as old as our government 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer also introduced a key element of his reauthorization strategy, in 
which the NEA is to refrain from trading body blows with conservative opponents 
who attempt to focus the debate on artworks of questionable taste the endowment 
may have supported. Under Frohnmayer's strategy, emphasis is to be maintained 
on quality examples of artistic excellence from among the 85,000 grants the 
agency has given. 
</P>
<P>
Other endowment officials acknowledged that the strategy is not without risk. 
Alvin S. Felzenberg, the NEA's senior deputy chairman, said, "I hope he's 
right" of Frohnmayer's decision to focus on positive examples of NEA support 
and essentially ignore the conservative drumbeat. In a press conference of his 
own after the hearing, Williams repeated a warning he gave to arts supporters 
last year: That the vociferousness of the conservative protest may make it 
nearly impossible to produce an NEA re-authorization bill this year completely 
free of content controls. 
</P>
<P>
But Felzenberg acknowledged that the situation remains risky for the NEA. "The 
debate (should be) over whether the NEA shall receive another renewal of its 
legislative life (based on its established record of artistic excellence). 
</P>
<P>
"If both sides focus on that debate, the chairman's optimism is well founded," 
he said. "If people do not focus on that debate, we may come out of it a little 
differently poised (in terms of being forced to impose content controls) than 
when we went in." 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's hearing, Norman Cousins, the prominent former magazine editor who 
is now an assistant dean of the UCLA School of Medicine, argued that "the 
greatest danger we face is to think that anyone knows enough to tell an artist 
what to paint or an author what to write. It is the shortest of all steps from 
telling writers what not to write or a painter what not to paint to telling a 
citizen what not to think or to think." 
</P>
<P>
Judith Baca, an internationally known Los Angeles muralist, urged the House 
subcommittee to not simply renew the legal life of the NEA but to double the 
arts agency's budget at the same time. "The United States should be the leader 
in the free market of ideas," Baca said, "and remember that an idea with which 
the majority of people do not agree could foster the greatest creativity in 
others."

The Air Force's SR-71 Blackbird spy plane smashed a transcontinental speed 
record today as it flew into retirement and the history books. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's fastest operational airplane took off from Edwards Air Force Base 
in California at 4:30 a.m., refueled offshore, flew back over Edwards and then 
shot off eastward at supersonic speeds that triggered a 6:01 a.m. sonic boom. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-to-Washington flight was 1 hour, 8 minutes and 17 seconds, said 
the Smithsonian Institution, which will keep the plane in the National Air and 
Space Museum. 
</P>
<P>
On the way to its retirement home at the museum, the airplane broke four flight 
time records, including the world record of 4 hours, 12 minutes and 10 seconds 
for a flight from Los Angeles to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"We figured it would make it in about an hour," said Barbara Kornylo of 
Lockheed, the builder of the airplane. 
</P>
<P>
The SR-71, designed in the early 1960s, is able to cruise faster than three 
times the speed of sound. The planes were built with a titanium alloy and can 
withstand temperatures exceeding 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The first flight of 
the SR-71 was on Dec. 22, 1964, the Smithsonian said. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackbird flies at an average speed of 2,200 m.p.h., about 400 m.p.h. to 
500 m.p.h. faster than the Concorde, which is the fastest airplane in 
commercial operation, Lockheed spokesman Jim Ragsdale said. 
</P>
<P>
The SR-71 was never designed for commercial passenger use. It has seats only 
for a pilot and a reconnaissance systems officer and was designed to fly high, 
fast and unarmed on photographic reconnaissance missions. Because of the high 
altitudes the aircraft can reach, crew members on missions had to wear pressure 
suits and be connected to life support systems. 
</P>
<P>
The SR-71s were officially retired on Feb. 26, but Lockheed requested one of 
them to break some records publicly on its last flight, something that the 
plane has been doing -- but on a classified basis -- for years, Kornylo said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to breaking the world Los Angeles-to-Washington record set several 
years ago by pilot Brooke Knapp in her Lear jet 35A, the Blackbird also set 
speed records for the following: Los Angeles to Washington, 2,153.24 m.p.h.; 
St. Louis to Cincinnati, 2,242.48 m.p.h., and Kansas City to Washington, 
2,200.94 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackbird, after fueling over the Pacific Ocean from an Air Force KC-135, a 
type of flying gas station, passed through a radar screen and quickly 
accelerated past the speed of sound. 
</P>
<P>
Southland residents, hearing the sonic boom, called police to report the sound 
of an explosion or earthquake, Sgt. James McClard said. 
</P>
<P>
While the Air Force has never publicly revealed how many SR-71s it commissioned 
to be built, 12 of them were stationed at Beale Air Force Base in Northern 
California in January. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the SR-71 that flew today, one is going to a museum at Warner-Robbins 
Air Force Base in Georgia, another to March Air Force Base in Southern 
California and three to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for 
use in high-altitude research.

A Long Beach teen-ager charged with shooting two deaf brothers from Palmdale, , 
killing one, waived extradition today from upstate New York where he was 
arrested, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Joey Paul Bellinger, 16, appeared in Oneida County Court and said he would not 
fight his return to Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
He should be returned in the next several days, said Sandi Gibbons, a 
spokeswoman for the District Attorney's Office. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an arraignment in Long Beach Municipal Court was postponed today 
until March 16 for Bellinger's father, Joseph Paul Bellinger Sr., 40, who was 
arrested Monday on suspicion of aiding his son's flight from California. The 
senior Bellinger was freed on bail, Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Bellinger, an unemployed high school dropout, is charged with 
murder and attempted murder in the Jan. 28 shooting of two Palmdale brothers, 
Cesar and Edward Vieira. Cesar Vieria, 30, died of chest wounds. Edward Vieira, 
25, is still recovering from hip and shoulder wounds.

The two-story brick Crested Butte State Bank building exploded shortly after 
opening today, rocking the historic mining town, killing three people and 
injuring at least a dozen more, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Gillen, a spokesman for the Gunnison County emergency response team, said 
rescuers are searching for more possible victims in the rubble of the building. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing left but the bank vault sitting in the rubble," said Michelle 
English-Batchelor, a passer-by. "It just isn't there. It was a big building. 
Now it's just an empty space." 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the explosion was not immediately known. Officials said there was 
no natural gas or propane service to the bank, but it was located in an area of 
town known as "The Bench," where there are known underground deposits of 
methane gas left over from old coal mines.

MCMARTIN PROSECUTORS REFILE ONLY 8 UNDECIDED COUNTS AGAINST BUCKEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prosecutors in the once-massive McMartin Pre-School molestation trial refiled 
only eight of the 13 remaining undecided counts against former teacher Ray 
Buckey today. 
</P>
<P>
"We are unable to proceed on those (other) counts," Deputy Dist. Atty. Pamela 
Ann Ferrero said of the three molestation charges and one conspiracy count. 
Only three of the five children tentatively scheduled to testify are willing to 
go forward, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Three girls -- including one new witness who did not testify at the first trial 
of Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey -- are expected to take the 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
The Buckeys were acquitted in January of 52 molestation counts after a 
three-year-long trial. But the jury deadlocked on 13 counts, all against Ray 
Buckey. The jurors had leaned toward acquittal but were unable to agree. After 
two weeks of public outcry, Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner decided 
to retry Buckey. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Danny Davis filed a motion today asking that Reiner's office 
be disqualified from handling the case, claiming that the decision to retry the 
case was politically motivated and that Reiner is prejudiced against his 
client. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my conviction that we need an independent, impartial, neutral and 
evenhanded evaluation of this case," he said. Society, not just the defense, 
has become "a pawn" in the case, which has broken records for the length and 
cost of the criminal proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
Davis also asked Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg not to drop 
one count which involved the boy whose allegations triggered the case nearly 
seven years ago. He said the move would prevent him from presenting evidence 
about the origins of the case. 
</P>
<P>
The defense request "seems a bit strange," said Weisberg, who is replacing 
Judge William R. Pounders as the trial judge. But he agreed to hear arguments 
this afternoon. Davis has said that the boy also implicated his own father in 
molestations and that his mother, who had a history of mental illness and 
alcoholism, accused several others before her death in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Jury selection is scheduled to begin Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The case began in 1983 with the arrest of Buckey. In early 1984 he and six 
other teachers at his family's Manhattan Beach nursery school were charged with 
hundreds of molestation counts and ordered to stand trial after a lengthy 
preliminary hearing. Reiner, however, proceeded against only Buckey and his 
mother, calling the evidence against the others "incredibly weak." 
</P>
<P>
The new trial -- dramatically reduced in scope -- is expected to last about six 
months.

A top official of the Texas Racing Commission, his wife and their two children 
were found shot to death in their home hours after the commission said it might 
revoke the license of the only horse track in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Police said today it was unclear whether the four were killed by someone 
outside the family or whether the killings were part of a murder-suicide 
scheme. 
</P>
<P>
David Joost was director of administration at the Racing Commission and his 
wife, Susan, also worked there. Neither of the Joosts turned up at work Monday. 
The bodies were discovered in the Joost home, about 12 miles south of Austin, 
after police were asked to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, the Racing Commission said it was considering revoking the 
license of G. Rollie White Downs, the only Texas track to offer pari-mutuel 
betting since the Legislature approved horse racing in 1987.

KOHL BACKS DOWN ON POLISH BORDER DEMANDS

Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose statements on Poland's border triggered 
international unease about German unification and a crisis in his Cabinet, 
today backed down from a demand that a border treaty be linked to Polish 
concessions. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl's government agreed to introduce a resolution in Parliament saying a 
united Germany should sign a treaty promising that it will never lay claim to 
Polish land, said the chancellor's chief of staff, Rudolf Seiters. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed resolution, to be introduced Thursday, is the closest the West 
German government has come to assuring Poland that a united Germany would never 
seek to recover land lost after the 1945 defeat of the Third Reich. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl has been reluctant to make such a statement, apparently fearing that he 
would lose the conservative vote in December elections. He has said he cannot 
speak for a united Germany. 
</P>
<P>
His recent statements on the border issue have stirred unease in Poland, the 
Soviet Union, the United States and elsewhere, just as the chancellor was 
seeking international support for German unification. 
</P>
<P>
His statements also caused controversy at home. The opposition Social Democrats 
and Kohl's coalition partners, the Free Democrats, charged that he was 
jeopardizing chances for unification. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Kohl heightened the dispute by demanding that any treaty 
recognizing Poland's borders be linked to Warsaw's waiving any war reparations 
and guaranteeing the rights of its German minority. 
</P>
<P>
Those statements caused a crisis in the Bonn government. Foreign Minister 
Hans-Dietrich Genscher's Free Democrats agreed with Poland that Kohl must make 
clear guarantees to Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Torsten Wolfgramm, a high-ranking official with the Free Democrats, confirmed 
today that Kohl has abandoned his demand that a border treaty be linked to any 
assurances from Poland. 
</P>
<P>
"It is completely clear. A treaty would contain only the border question," 
Wolfgramm said. 
</P>
<P>
Seiters said that, once Germany is united, its government would forge a treaty 
with Poland guaranteeing its current borders. 
</P>
<P>
Seiters said the resolution to be introduced in Parliament on Thursday will 
call for a declaration by both Germanys on respecting Poland's western border. 
That would occur after East Germany's March 18 elections, he said.

Israeli Labor Party ministers today gave Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir one day 
to accept a U.S. plan for peace talks with Palestinians or see the coalition 
government collapse. 
</P>
<P>
"In practical terms, by tomorrow the issue must be decided," Energy Minister 
Moshe Shahal said after an emergency party meeting of Labor Cabinet ministers. 
</P>
<P>
The country's 12-member policy-making inner Cabinet is due to hold the decisive 
debate Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"If there will not be a vote or if the vote goes against a positive response to 
the (U.S.) questions, it will mean the end of the national unity government," 
Shahal said. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, the pivotal figure in the unity government, 
told reporters after the meeting, "I see an urgent need in convening the inner 
Cabinet and taking a decision." 
</P>
<P>
An angry Rabin said he completely rejected demands that Shamir's rightist Likud 
Party made Monday as conditions for joining Cairo peace talks proposed by 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III. 
</P>
<P>
If Shamir fails Wednesday to agree to the holding of the first 
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks ever, the dovish Labor Party could call at a 
regular weekly meeting Thursday for the party to quit the 15-month-old 
government. 
</P>
<P>
A general party meeting would have to approve a formal decision and ministers 
said this could be held one week after the deadline to Shamir. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir's Likud on Monday demanded Labor support an Israeli position that would 
exclude the 140,000 East Jerusalem Arabs from Palestinian elections, which the 
peace talks are supposed to arrange. 
</P>
<P>
It also wanted a guarantee that Labor would agree to the talks being broken off 
if Palestinian negotiators said they represented the Palestine Liberation 
Organization, branded by Israel as a terrorist group. 
</P>
<P>
Labor had already agreed to East Jerusalem Palestinians voting and said it did 
not care whom the Palestinian negotiators consulted. 
</P>
<P>
Israel seized East Jerusalem and the West Bank of the Jordan River from Jordan 
and the Gaza Strip from Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war. 
</P>
<P>
Labor leader Vice Premier Shimon Peres said Likud had effectively rejected 
Baker's formula for talks with Palestinians to implement the Israeli May 14 
plan for elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
The United States publicly asked last week for Shamir to decide on the talks. 
But instead, a five-hour Likud meeting Monday night produced new demands on his 
Labor coalition partners before going ahead with the Cairo talks. 
</P>
<P>
Labor leaders denounced the Likud terms as an attempt to question their 
commitment to holding all of Jerusalem. Labor ministers Tuesday reaffirmed 
their support for an undivided Jerusalem as Israel's capital.

"At the moment I think it will be sufficient to ease the law, but in three 
years we may have to make a drastic change," said Trade Minister Kabun Muto. 
</P>
<P>
The retail store law, designed to protect tiny family stores, requires large 
stores to seek approval of the smaller stores in a neighborhood before opening.

leading hotels. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Swissair said the sale will become final as soon as smaller 
shareholders in some of the hotels approve the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
"It was decided to seek a buyer because Swissotel failed to reach the total of 
30 or so hotels which were seen necessary to make operations profitable," the 
spokesman said. "Aoki/Westin was chosen because it will give Swissair access to 
nearly 100 top hotels around the world."

ORDERS FOR DURABLE GOODS PLUNGE 5.4%; 
</P>
<P>
COMMERCE: U.S. SAYS PLUNGE OF KEY INDICATOR OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN JANUARY WAS 
THE LARGEST SINCE DECEMBER OF 1974.

<P>
Orders to U.S. factories for manufactured goods plunged 5.4% in January, the 
largest one-month decline in nearly 16 years, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said orders for both durable and non-durable goods 
totaled a seasonally adjusted $227.7 billion after gains of 0.4% in December 
and 2.4% in November. 
</P>
<P>
It was the steepest decline since a 7% drop in December, 1974. In addition, the 
December gain was revised downward to 0.4% from 1.9% reported last month. 
</P>
<P>
Durable goods orders plunged 10.5% to a seasonally adjusted $117.8 billion. It 
was the biggest drop in 32 years of record-keeping and broke the previous 
record drop of 9.2% that was set in February, 1982, during the last recession. 
</P>
<P>
Orders for durable goods -- big-ticket items expected to last more than three 
years and often financed by loans -- were held down for much of 1989 by the 
Federal Reserve's anti-inflation, high-interest policies. 
</P>
<P>
However, orders picked up late last fall, jumping 4.8% in November and 1.2% in 
December and prompting many analysts to conclude the economy's manufacturing 
sector was stabilizing. 
</P>
<P>
But the optimism paled after last week's initial report on durable goods 
orders, with some expressing fears that further weakness in manufacturing could 
lead to more job layoffs, sagging consumer confidence and cutbacks in consumer 
spending, which accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
"The decline in durable goods was mostly in transportation equipment, down 
28.8%," the department said. That was a revision from the 27.6% drop reported 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Aircraft and parts, motor vehicles and parts and shipbuilding and tanks all 
declined," the department said. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding transportation, orders were off 1%. 
</P>
<P>
In the key category of non-defense capital goods, a barometer of business 
investment plans, orders fell 14.2% in January to $38.1 billion, reversing a 
14.1% gain in December. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to new orders, the Commerce Department said shipments of 
manufactured goods dropped 1.9% in January to $226.6 billion. Inventories rose 
0.7% to $373.9 billion, nearly offsetting a 0.5% decrease in December. 
</P>
<P>
If inventories increase without a corresponding gain in new orders, it could 
signal production cutbacks as factories attempt to get rid of goods stored on 
shelves and back lots. 
</P>
<P>
Non-durable orders were up 0.8% to $109.9 billion after declining 0.5% in 
December and 0.2% in November. 
</P>
<P>
The volatile defense orders fell for the second consecutive month, down 28.8% 
to $6.95 billion after declining a revised 13.3% in December. The December 
figure originally was reported to be 11.6%. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding defense, factory orders were off 4.4%. 
</P>
<P>
Among the durable goods orders, electrical machinery was down 15.5% to $19.2 
billion, most of which was in communications equipment.

Nearly 4,000 feet of film on Albert Einstein that was part of the University of 
South Carolina's Movietonews collection fell out of a delivery truck and has 
been missing for a week, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"From a historical standpoint, it is absolutely irreplaceable," said Don 
McCallister, assistant archivist for the university's News Film Library. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't really put a dollar value on it. How do you put a dollar value on 
something that cannot be replaced?" 
</P>
<P>
The film, which has historical value to researchers, shows Einstein appearing 
at various events during the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
The university was sending the film, which was packed in a 1-foot-square 
fiberboard carton, to Audio Plus Video International in Northvale, N.J., so it 
could be copied onto videotape for a French filmmaker, McCallister said. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 27, a delivery truck carrying the film left the Federal Express office 
in Columbia. A few blocks down the road, the driver realized the back door had 
opened. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Express workers searched the route but did not find the package. 
</P>
<P>
"We are doing everything we can to try to find this package," Sandra Munoz, a 
spokeswoman for Federal Express in Memphis, said today.

DICK CLARK MOVES 'BANDSTAND' TO DINERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
OK, so MTV and other video channels knocked "American Bandstand" off the air 
last October. 
</P>
<P>
Now Burbank-based Dick Clark Productions hopes its name, spirit and ability to 
generate cash flow from the American public will rock on at a string of novelty 
restaurants named for the television show that entertained generations of 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
A pilot diner overlooking Biscayne Bay in Miami opened Monday as Dick Clark's 
American Bandstand Grill, complete with a mock "Bandstand" set; a pop art 
cellar club that recalls the 1960s and other decade theme areas; a sing-along 
arena; and TV monitors churning out repeats of "Bandstand" segments from 1958 
to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
For dessert, patrons can use the grill's video studio. For a fee, they can 
record their own music videos with intros from Clark, once known as "America's 
oldest teen-ager" and the host of "American Bandstand" for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We realize there is untapped value in certain trademarks," said Francis C. La 
Maina, president of Dick Clark Productions. "For the past year we have been 
actively exploring ways to capitalize on those assets." 
</P>
<P>
The Burbank company kicked in its famous name in a joint venture with Harmon 
Entertainment, a Secaucus, N.J., commercial real estate outfit that paid 
start-up costs and the $2-million construction cost of the 8,500-square-foot 
restaurant.

RECYCLED PERRY MASON A TV HIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Television these days has taken to recycling its series, and none have been 
more successful than Perry Mason. 
</P>
<P>
"The Brady Bunch" was a recycled hit in two TV movies but so far has failed to 
burn up the Nielsens as a weekly series. 
</P>
<P>
"The Incredible Hulk" made the final sacrifice and died for ratings last month 
in "The Death of the Incredible Hulk," which was the fifth most popular 
made-for-TV movie during the February sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
"The Love Boat" made a Valentine voyage and turned up ninth on the TV movie 
list for February. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Burr and his alter ego Perry Mason made their first appearance on CBS 
as a series on Sept. 21, 1957, but the latter-day adventures of Mason and Della 
Street and company began on NBC on Dec. 1, 1985, with a two-hour movie aptly 
titled "Perry Mason Returns." 
</P>
<P>
The show scored a whopping 27.2 rating and a 39 share. Thirteen Perry Mason 
films have aired on NBC since then. 
</P>
<P>
Not only has America proved it loves its "PM" TVs, but the show also provides a 
new kind of TV format -- the recurring movie that is not a one-shot venture and 
not a full-fledged series. CBS has been successful with the same format in the 
recurring Janek cop series starring Richard Crenna. 
</P>
<P>
The latest in the Mason series is "Perry Mason: The Case of the Desperate 
Deception," to air Sunday at 9 p.m.. 
</P>
<P>
The show was shot in Paris and has Perry appearing before the bench in a French 
court, defending a U.S. Marine officer accused of killing a Nazi war criminal. 
Motive? The Nazi was responsible for the cruel treatment of his mother in a 
German forced labor camp. 
</P>
<P>
Like many of the earlier Perry Mason films, the flick brings in added interest 
with some high-caliber guests -- in this case Yvette Mimieux, Ian McShane and 
Academy Award winner Teresa Wright as the wronged mother. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, now 71, called making the Perry Mason film "great fun" and said it was 
nice to work with Raymond Burr again.

Most people won't recognize her name, but Helen Stearns collaborated on several 
songs with her brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
The brother-in-law was Hoagy Carmichael, who composed such legendary songs as 
"Star Dust," "Lazybones," and "Georgia On My Mind." 
</P>
<P>
He died in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved to listen to him play," Stearns said. "He'd be sitting there pecking 
around on the piano and he'd come up with a tune and say, 'You're the writer. 
Give me some words.' So I did sometimes. We wrote a lot of songs together, 
mostly children's songs." 
</P>
<P>
"April In My Heart" was one of their best. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think much about it at the time, but I still get small royalty checks 
for it from time to time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Stearns, 82, was back in Carmichael's native state over the weekend in 
conjunction with a retrospective concert by the Indiana Symphony Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, there's something about Hoosiers that is wholesome," she said. "No 
matter where they go or what they do, they carry it with them. That's what I 
remember about Hoagy. He was always wholesome in that odd Hoosier way. 
</P>
<P>
"That, I guess, and his music were what I liked most about him." 
</P>
<P>
Stearns was one of the "Barclay Girls" who modeled for artist McLelland Barclay 
in the 1930s, wrote screenplays that included the hit 1937 movie "I Met Him In 
Paris," and later worked as a newspaper editor in California and Maine, and as 
a writer, editor and publisher of children's books.

The two sisters, Vanessa and Lynn, have never performed together publicly,

"I always felt that to justify spending so long away it would have to be 
something very special for me to return," said Lynn, who received an Academy

Manson, who was suspended for 13 games earlier this season, was also fined 
$500, NHL Vice President Brian O'Neill said.

"The videotape offers no assistance in identifying which of the two players

U.S. midfield soccer star Hugo Perez said today he may miss this summer's World 
Cup finals in Italy after breaking a leg in a match on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Perez, who plays for French second division side Red Star of Paris, broke a 
fibula after coming on as a second-half substitute in the 2-1 victory at 
Gueugnon. 
</P>
<P>
The El Salvador-born player, a naturalized U.S. citizen, said he would be in 
plaster for three to six weeks but still has hopes of being fit in time for the 
finals. 
</P>

MISTER FRISKY IS THE NO. 1 DERBY PROSPECT 
</P>

Who's No. 1? 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to initial assessments, all of the best 3-year-olds bound for the 
Kentucky Derby are not wintering in Florida. Mister Frisky awaits the Triple 
Crown in Laz Barrera's barn at Santa Anita in Arcadia, not far from the barn in 
which Sunday Silence awaited his Derby ambush of the heavily favored Easy Goer 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Mister Frisky is 15-for-15 lifetime after an impressive victory in Saturday's 
mile San Rafael. It was his second victory in California after 13 in Puerto 
Rico, three of which set track records at El Comandante, where he won at 
distances up to 9 furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
Mister Frisky is a Florida-bred son of the little-known Marsayas, who is by 
Damascus. After the weekend's 3-year-old stakes he not only stands alone as the 
Kentucky Derby favorite but poses an immediate threat to Citation's record of 
16 consecutive victories at ages 2 and 3. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people didn't believe he could run this way," Barrera said after the 
San Rafael. "They don't realize he set three records. When I went to Puerto 
Rico to see him, I said, 'He's a machine.' He'll go any distance." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Stevens said that when Tight Spot challenged his mount in the stretch 
Saturday, "(Mister Frisky) grabbed the bit like a cat and hit another gear." So 
far, he is the only 3-year-old to find that extra gear this season. He's No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
If the Western leader has been determined, his counterpart in the East remains 
unidentified. An assessment of Saturday's Fountain of Youth Stakes at 
Gulfstream Park requires a fair amount of guessing. And then there is Red 
Ransom, who lost at 3-to-10 odds in his seasonal debut in a 7-furlong 
allowance. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Red Ransom did not appear sharp in the paddock before his debut, which was 
probably the result of trainer Mack Miller's backing off after a very fast work 
10 days before. Miller said he may have left the colt a bit short for his first 
start, but that may have been his intention. After what was more a useful 
conditioning race than a true preview of what may be the real Red Ransom, 
Miller mentioned the 7-furlong Swale Stakes March 17 at Gulfstream as the next 
step. He also mentioned a 1 1/16-mile allowance. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Slavic, who went off as the favorite Saturday and took sixth place, turned 
in a one-paced effort that is also less alarming than was evident at first 
glance, and it is likely that the Fountain of Youth provided the useful prep 
for the Florida Derby that his connections were looking for. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Roanoke ran well on a speed-favoring track to finish fifth in his first 
start of the season, and he appears capable of playing a more substantial role 
in the 9-furlong Florida Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Shot Gun Scott, surprise winner of the Fountain of Youth, is apparently the 
season's best-kept secret, understandable since he has never raced outside 
Florida. Trainer Ron Sarazin is considering the Florida Derby and the Jim Beam 
Stakes, March 31 at Turfway Park. 
</P>
<P>
 -- There is room for alarm in the Rhythm and Yonder camps, however. 
</P>
<P>
Examination revealed that Rhythm did not bleed during the Fountain of Youth, 
Shug McGaughey said Sunday morning. The colt experienced difficulty in 
breathing near the three-eighths pole, a condition that may explain his dull 
effort in the Hutcheson two weeks earlier. McGaughey said that the colt's 
breathing was obstructed by his palate and said a veterinarian would be 
summoned from Ohio this week.

<P>
Sand Devil led all the way and breezed to a six-length victory in the $34,000 
Make Amends purse at Aqueduct on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The winner, coupled in the wagering with Indian Navy, was ridden by James Bruin 
and carried 117 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Slick Jack, 117, took second place in the seven-horse field under Angel Cordero 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the first in four starts for Sand Devil, which went 1 1/8 on 
the fast track in 1:51 2/5. 
</P>
<P>
The winning entry returned $5.80, $2.80 and $2.80. Slick Jack paid $2.60 and 
$2.60 and Adam's Blend was $3.60 to show. 
</P>
<P>
At Sportsman's Park in Chicago, Quintillion, ridden by Mark Guidry, charged 
from 20 lengths behind the leader with half a mile left in the $20,000 American 
Prince Purse to score a 2 1/4 lengths victory Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Dvoik finished second and Royal Bonus rallied for third in the one-mile 
attraction, which matched a field of seven 4-year-olds and up. The race was 
held over a fast track as heavy snow fell. 
</P>
<P>
Quintillion, the 9-5 favorite, was timed in 1:41 2/5 and paid $5.60, $2.80 and 
$2.40. Dvoik, a 4-1 shot, paid $4.20 and $2.60. Royal Bonus, the 2-1 second 
choice, paid $2.20.

CARDINAL REVEALS 2 RECENT EXORCISMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Roman Catholic priests have performed two exorcisms in New York recently to 
banish the devil, and Cardinal John J. O'Connor blames heavy-metal rock music 
for popularizing devil worship. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor said in his Sunday sermon at St. Patrick's Cathedral that "as far as 
we know (the exorcisms) have been successful." O'Connor said heavy-metal music 
"can help trap people, especially teen-agers," into devil worship. "I think the 
industry had better police itself," O'Connor said.

PROFILE: ACTRESS WAGED A 'DRASTIC AND HORRIBLE AND SUCCESSFUL' FIGHT AGAINST 
KIDNEY CANCER. NOW, SHE PREPARES FOR A ROLE IN THE MINISERIES 'THE YOUNG

<TEXT>
<P>
Lee Remick made an unforgettable film debut as the sexy drum majorette who 
marries the power-corrupted Andy Griffith in Elia Kazan's "A Face in the Crowd" 
in 1957. Her lithe, blue-eyed beauty and her disturbing blend of youthful 
innocence and grown-up sensuality raised the movie's temperature several 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
She was 22 and, as history was to show, launching an impressive acting career 
that next saw her as Anthony Franciosa's wife in "The Long Hot Summer," based 
on some William Faulkner stories. There was an Oscar nomination for "Days of 
Wine and Roses," opposite Jack Lemmon, with whom she co-starred again in 
"Tribute" in 1980. She was a Henry James heroine in "The Europeans" and Winston 
Churchill's mother in television's "Jenny." 
</P>
<P>
Remick has done stage, screen and television, her presence a kind of seal of 
quality, and she's rarely been idle, here or in England where she lived for 
many years with her second husband, Kip Gowans. He was a first assistant 
director when they married in 1970. He is now a producer in Hollywood, and they 
divide their time between Los Angeles and a home on Cape Cod. (Remick was born 
in nearby Quincy, Mass.) 
</P>
<P>
Then, eight months ago, Remick was found to have kidney cancer. The treatments, 
mostly at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland, were "drastic and 
horrible and successful," she says, "and now I'm back." She shows no signs of 
the ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned a lot. I learned what matters, and what doesn't. I learned it 
doesn't make sense to let little things get you down. Or to choose the little 
things that you want to matter to you." 
</P>
<P>
She is about to go back to work, having signed to play the mother of the 
teen-age German princess who married the Grand Duke Peter and in time became 
Catherine the Great of Russia. A miniseries for Ted Turner, "The Young 
Catherine," will commence shooting in Leningrad in mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very manipulative, something of a stage mother," Remick says. Vanessa 
Redgrave will play the Empress, Maximilian Schell Frederick the Great in the 
four-hour, two-part series written by Chris Bryant and to be directed by 
Michael Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
Remick was almost inevitably a performer. Her mother, Patricia, was an actress. 
Possibly more important, her great-grandmother, Eliza Duffield, was an 
English-born preacher who had a congregation in Round Hill, N.Y. Remick recalls 
being taken as a very small child to see and hear her great-grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
"She was 4-feet-nothing but she had a huge, booming voice and a British accent 
and she sang hymns while she accompanied herself. She ruled her family and 
everybody around her with an iron hand. People quaked in her presence." 
</P>
<P>
Remick set out to be a dancer, is glad for the training and glad she didn't 
make it as a dancer. "I wouldn't have been that good, and what's the sense of 
trying to do something you're not good enough at. Things work out the way 
they're supposed to, and they did for me. But the training was wonderful and 
the discipline you have to have as a dancer has been of endless value 
throughout my life -- to say nothing of being able to work through pain, and, 
boy, do you work through pain as a dancer." 
</P>
<P>
She was 16 and attending the fashionable Miss Hewitt's School in Manhattan when 
someone saw her and cast her in a Broadway play called "Act Your Age." It 
bombed out quickly but not before she knew that she'd found her calling. 
</P>
<P>
She did summer stock, toured with Rudy Vallee in "Jenny Kissed Me" and began to 
appear in live television dramas. In 1964 she was cast, along with Angela 
Lansbury, in Stephen Sondheim's first musical, "Anyone Can Whistle." 
</P>
<P>
"It was magical because of Stephen's score," she says, "but even those who 
loved it agreed it was ahead of its time." It had a short life, but it 
continues to resonate in the memories of those who know the music. 
</P>
<P>
"I did a couple of Playhouse 90s," Remick says, "and Robert Montgomerys and 
Krafts and Armstrongs" (a litany of the hour and the 90-minute dramas that were 
the glory of television before it learned to tape). Kazan saw her in one of the 
dramas; Remick is not sure which one. 
</P>
<P>
The day after it aired, "I was out and about and I called my answering service. 
No machines in those days, at least I didn't have one. There was a slew of 
messages and I didn't have anything to write with. So I could only remember the 
last number and call it. 
</P>
<P>
"It turned out to be Kazan's assistant, wanting me to come in." It was to read 
for "A Face in the Crowd," which Budd Schulberg scripted from one of his own 
stories. The film was shot entirely in Pickett, Ark., and New York, but 
Hollywood was the next step. 
</P>
<P>
Remick has two children by her first marriage to television producer Bill 
Colleran, a daughter 31, who has just been married, and a son, 28. Neither 
wants to act. Her daughter writes, the son is in post-production sound. Remick 
is not sorry. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably just as well. It's so much more difficult now. You're either 
instantly successful or you flounder around. And of course we're all just 
asking for rejection. We keep hoping it won't happen because it's so painful, 
but of course it does. It comes to absolutely every one of us. And it's your 
whole entire self that's being rejected, no matter what they say. You stand 
there and you get it right between eyes." 
</P>
<P>
It's Oscar time and Remick remembers the Monday night she and Lemmon attended 
the ceremonies when both were nominated for "Days of Wine and Roses." 
</P>
<P>
"I was sitting on the aisle, as you do if you're a nominee, and Jack and 
Felicia (Farr, his wife) were sitting a few rows ahead. He saw me and came back 
and kissed me and I said, 'Good luck tonight,' and he grinned and said, 'No, I 
don't think so either.' " 
</P>
<P>
The honors that year went to Gregory Peck for "To Kill a Mockingbird" and Anne 
Bancroft for "The Miracle Worker." 
</P>
<P>
Remick shockingly confessed to an interviewer once that she was a terrible 
interview. It's nonsense, and she is a wonderfully engaging talker. At a recent 
lunch she was remembering becoming aware of a woman who was walking back and 
forth, observing her closely, getting up nerve. At last the woman approached 
her and said, "You're Lee Remick, aren't you?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Remick confessed; "I'm Lee Remick." 
</P>
<P>
"I thought so," the woman said with satisfaction. "You look so much like her, 
and she's so pretty." 
</P>
<P>
"It was almost mystical, metaphysical," Remick said the other day. "Then I 
realized that she was separating the me she saw on the screen from the me she 
was seeing in person." 
</P>
<P>
She also remembers a night at a London theater when she had her then very young 
son along. The usher was flustered to meet her and very solicitous. Would she 
like a child's seat for the boy? "I said that would be terribly nice, and she 
said, 'I'll bring it as soon as I almost can.' " 
</P>
<P>
Then again, Lee Remick can have that effect on almost anyone. It may be the 
blue eyes.
