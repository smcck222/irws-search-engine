The First Lady hopes her new project will be one for the books. Once again 
turning her attention to a longtime favorite cause, she announced the formation 
of the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy. The volunteer program, 
headed by Joan Abrahamson of Los Angeles' Jefferson Institute, will raise money 
and distribute grants to existing literacy programs that involve not only 
children, but also their parents and grandparents. President Bush paid a 
surprise visit to the White House lunch at which the foundation plan was 
announced, labeling himself "a fly on the wall" who has "studied with Barbara 
Bush and learned a lot." Among the 120 luncheon guests were women who are 
learning to read along with their children. Also attending were Education 
Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos and Labor Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole.

 -- Japan's Empress Dowager Nagako, widow of Emperor Hirohito, observed her 
86th birthday privately with her family at the imperial palace, a spokesman 
said. The empress dowager, who has made few public appearances since last year 
because of worsening health, lunched with her son, Emperor Akihito, his wife, 
Empress Michiko, and other family members, the spokesman said. No public 
ceremonies were scheduled because of continued mourning for Emperor Hirohito, 
who died Jan. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In another part of Asia, final preparations were under way for the 
coronation of a 43-year-old prince as the new Sultan of Jogjakarta. Prince 
Mangkubumi, who runs a construction company and heads local branches of the 
Chamber of Commerce and the ruling political party, will be crowned today in 
one of Indonesia's last kingdoms. The prince is the eldest son of 
Hamengkubuwono IX, a hero of Indonesia's struggle for independence and ruler of 
one of Java's four remaining sultanates for 48 years before he died last 
October at age 76. He held national government posts, but "the new sultan will 
only reign over the family," an official said. Hundreds of guards took up 
positions around the palace courtyard as retainers prepared a banyan tree to be 
planted by the new sultan to mark the start of his rule. SHIRLEY MARLOW

THEORIES ABOUND ON ORIGIN OF THE BIG 'S' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Between munches of a chicken salad bagel, one woman said she had heard that 
Skinheads did it. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard they painted the 'S,' " she said in a conspiratorial whisper. "I heard 
they wanted to paint a W and a P, as well, for Supreme White Power. That's what 
the Skinheads like to paint. But the police caught them before they could do 
the other two letters." 
</P>
<P>
The women were lunching at Baltimore Bagel Co., a bakery-delicatessen on Navajo 
Road in San Carlos, in the shadow of Cowles Mountain, which at 1,591 feet is 
the highest point in the city of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The subject of their concern -- and a conversational topic among many in San 
Carlos these days -- was the "S" painted in large white letters on the side of 
Cowles Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hidden by Brush 
</P>
<P>
For many years the S was hidden by heavy brush, but, in September, a fire made 
it visible again. The sudden appearance has made it San Carlos' low-rent 
version of the shroud of Turin or the Loch Ness monster, spawning a number of 
theories about its origin. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Brau, president of Baltimore Bagel Co., said one employee in his San 
Carlos outlet is convinced that Skinheads did it. Another insists that San 
Diego State University students did it. Another says it stands for State, as in 
SDSU. And yet another says it stands for San Carlos. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Willard, a community service officer for the San Diego 
</P>
<P>
Police Department, said he has heard all the theories and has one that is his 
personal favorite. 
</P>
<P>
"Recently, an El Cajon business was using a large inflatable Superman in one of 
its displays," Willard said. "Well, somehow, Superman got away and started 
flying over Cowles Mountain. Somebody said the S mysteriously appeared after 
Superman's flight. So, I like that one the best -- Superman put it up there, 
like a cat marking a tree." 
</P>
<P>
And now for the truth, or the version that most folks seem to see as the truth: 
A spokesman for the Open Space Division of the city Park and Recreation 
Department -- who asked not to be quoted by name -- said the S was painted as 
long ago as the 1950s, probably much earlier. 
</P>
<P>
He said it was done by fraternity and sorority students at SDSU. It vanished 
for a number of years, held hostage by heavy brush. The Cowles Mountain fire of 
Sept. 3, 1988, burned away much of the brush, causing it to reappear. Not only 
was brush not blocking it from view, but the blackened ground silhouetted it 
and made it as visible as it's ever been. 
</P>
<P>
Because many San Diegans were not here in the '50s, or the '60s, '70s or early 
'80s, they naturally wondered about the origin of the S. 
</P>
<P>
Some who have been in San Diego for those years view the S fondly, even 
nostalgically, and want it preserved. To some it's San Diego's 
</P>
<P>
version of the famous HOLLYWOOD that appears on the side of a mountain about 
100 miles north. 
</P>
<P>
"It stands for San Diego State," said Gail Rodieck, a San Carlos homeowner who 
graduated from SDSU in 1968. "Back in the '50s, it was a big deal for 
fraternities and sororities to climb up Cowles and use lime to paint the S. I'm 
not sure why they don't do it anymore. Maybe it's a lack of school spirit. They 
used to maintain it every year. It was really a big deal. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I never went up there and did it. I thought it was silly. But 
really, what's the big deal? Little towns across America have letters like that 
on mountains or water towers. Why can't we?" 
</P>
<P>
Rodieck laughed hysterically about the Skinhead theory. 
</P>
<P>
"That thing's been up there long before any Skinheads were born," she said. 
"Yeah, Skinheads did it. They made the mountain bald so we could all see their 
S." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Aronoff, a Laguna Beach businessman who attended SDSU from 1967 to 1971 
and then worked there until 1985, said the S has been part of Cowles Mountain 
lore since the days of the Great Depression. 
</P>
<P>
"The school opened in February of 1931," Aronoff said by telephone from Orange 
County. "Shortly after that, it became an annual freshman rite to climb up 
there at the start of the school year and relime the S. It became a tradition, 
but it was also important for aircraft. It became a beacon for pilots to know 
where they were. I'm not kidding. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe it or not, during the war, somebody painted over it, fearing it could 
be a distinguishing mark for San Diego, one that might tempt an enemy. I 
painted it in 1971 as part of a homecoming ritual. It may have been done once 
or twice since that time. I know no one said anything about it in '71 -- that 
is, no one accused us of doing anything wrong. In fact, just the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that it became very uncool to do it in the '60s -- it was not an 
environmentally sound thing to do. But really, now, it's just part of the 
history of San Diego, and of SDSU." 
</P>
<P>
But the Park and Recreation Department spokesman said times have changed, and 
no one should try to embellish the S today. Since the late '60s, it has been 
part of Mission Trails Regional Park, operated jointly by the city and county. 
The man said anyone trying to paint or repaint the S now, without city 
permission, would be in serious trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"That would be an act of vandalism, and the police would go after them with a 
vengeance," he said. "Or, our ranger would. Park and Rec has a ranger stationed 
full-time on Cowles Mountain. We would like to totally get rid of the stupid 
thing. We hate it. We think it looks stupid."

DEL MAR IGNORES POLL, SEEKS GRANT TO KEEP SMOKESTACK AS COASTAL LANDMARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is the stack doomed? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the days may be numbered for the venerable powerhouse smokestack, a huge 
concrete edifice that has towered over upscale Del Mar for more than 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
Public opinion seems to favor the structure's demise. A recent poll, mailed by 
the city to 4,200 registered voters, showed that four out of five respondents 
did not want the stack retained as a Del Mar landmark. 
</P>
<P>
Of the surveys returned to the city, 379 people favored demolishing the 
smokestack, and 86 wanted to see it remain. The closest the stack got to a 
favorable response was a question about using state money to save the 
structure, with 78 respondents supporting the grant and 80 opposed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City Perseveres in Effort to Win Grant 
</P>
<P>
Undeterred by the poll results, city officials are going forward with an effort 
to win a $200,000 state historical grant in hopes of preserving the smokestack, 
which was built near the beach in the mid-1920s to help supply electricity to 
the old Del Mar Hotel and other parts of town. 
</P>
<P>
But officials are not optimistic. Mayor John Gillies said "chances are slim" 
that the city will get the grant, making it almost inevitable that the stack 
"will be demolished." 
</P>
<P>
"I was disappointed by the poll," Gillies said. "Personally, I'd like to save 
it. It's just such a technological anomaly, it seems worth saving." 
</P>
<P>
Although the smokestack appears destined for the wrecker's ball, the adjacent 
two-story powerhouse building, which served as a boiler room, is scheduled for 
preservation. City officials want to turn the building into a community center 
and have applied for another state grant to cover the expected $300,000 in 
rehabilitation costs. 
</P>
<P>
The 60-foot-high smokestack, for years the only high-rise in Del Mar, helped 
provide electricity for just more than a decade. It was taken out of service in 
1936, when San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. began providing power to Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Remains a Coastal Landmark 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the structure remained a coastal landmark. During the 1950s, the 
powerhouse building became a club featuring jazz bands, and the smokestack was 
used as a vertical signpost to advertise the spot, known as "The Roaring '20s." 
</P>
<P>
A research firm that was designing reverse osmosis techniques to turn seawater 
into drinking water occupied the building in the 1960s. In 1977, an investor 
bought the property and planned to convert the powerhouse into a swank 
restaurant, but the city balked at the idea and eventually bought the property. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the stack is flanked by a grassy park and a restaurant. The final phase 
of the park project involves restoration of the powerhouse building and, 
perhaps, the smokestack. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the city gets the money, rehabilitation of the stack will not be easy. 
The structure's concrete skin has been stripped in spots, exposing the steel 
frame to the salty sea air. 
</P>
<P>
Officials estimate it would cost at least $200,000 to restore the stack and 
have toyed with the idea of erecting a replica for about $150,000. The cost of 
demolishing the smokestack is estimated at $30,000 to $65,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the bottom line will be whether we can get funding from outside the 
city," said Councilwoman Brooke Eisenberg. "I personally love it. I just think 
it says 'powerhouse' to me. I mean, what's a powerhouse without a smokestack?"

GOVERNOR NAMES 7 TO SUPERIOR COURT; TRIALS TO RESUME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIFER WARREN and DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a sweeping move expected to relieve a manpower shortage that sparked a 
3-week-old ban on all new civil trials, Gov. George Deukmejian on Monday named 
seven San Diego County men to the Superior Court bench. 
</P>
<P>
The new judges include four jurists promoted from the Municipal Court, two 
civil attorneys and a state prosecutor. They were generally lauded as a 
respected and experienced group, but one attorney lamented that no women were 
among the appointments. 
</P>
<P>
All four Municipal Court judges elevated by Deukmejian were named to the lower 
court by the governor from 1985 to 1987. They are Jesus Rodriguez, Louis E. 
Boyle, Raymond Edwards Jr. and Peter E. Riddle. 
</P>
<P>
The two civil attorneys are Daniel J. Tobin, a veteran La Mesa lawyer, and 
Robert J. O'Neill, a former Superior Court judge who left the bench to enter 
private practice in 1986. Also appointed was Michael D. Wellington, a 
supervising deputy attorney general in San Diego since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Greeted With Relief 
</P>
<P>
The governor's appointments, which filled more than a third of the 18 vacancies 
on the bench in one fell swoop, were greeted with relief by the court's 
presiding judge, Michael I. Greer, who postponed all new civil trials Feb. 10 
because of an overwhelming backlog of criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
Greer, who conducted the swearing-in of five of the new judges at a festive 
ceremony Monday, said the infusion of manpower will allow civil trials to 
resume "very shortly," possibly by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as we get these people on board, we'll be back in business," Greer 
said. "This is a happy day." 
</P>
<P>
Greer said the recent retirement and elevation of five judges means there are 
courtrooms to accommodate the newcomers. But many of the 11 remaining 
appointees that will bring the court to full strength will probably operate 
from temporary quarters being readied at the Hotel San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Beermann, a Deukmejian spokesman, said the governor's appointments should 
not be seen as a response to pleas for help from San Diego County. But Beermann 
said the governor hopes that the additional bodies will help ease the logjam in 
the county's courts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Significant Difference' 
</P>
<P>
"With the large number of vacancies that do exist, these seven additional 
appointments should make a significant difference in reducing that backlog," 
Beermann said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Deukmejian is working to fill the remaining vacancies as quickly as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
Court officials say the crunch that brought civil trials to a halt last month 
has been building gradually since last fall and was exacerbated by vacancies 
created by the retirement of three judges and the elevation of two to the 4th 
District Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Greer has laid blame for the troubles on the San Diego County clerk's office, 
charging that the clerk has failed to keep him apprised of the growing number 
of criminal cases facing dismissal unless trials begin immediately. (Under law, 
criminal cases must be in court within 60 days, unless a defendant waives his 
right to a speedy trial.) 
</P>
<P>
County Clerk Robert D. Zumwalt, however, argues that the problem was created by 
the county's swelling criminal caseload and the failure of judicial 
appointments to keep pace. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Greer said some civil cases are now being heard by attorneys sitting 
as judges, an arrangement that both sides in a dispute must agree to. Also, two 
retired judges have been pinch-hitting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Slows Down Settlements' 
</P>
<P>
"It's been difficult, but we've had a lot of cooperation and understanding from 
the lawyers," Greer said. "The main problem is it slows down settlements. The 
best (impetus) for settling a case is a judge and jury." 
</P>
<P>
Greer estimated that about 15 civil trials have been suspended because of the 
manpower problem. Although that may seem a small number, "it's a ton when you 
consider that we try maybe three of every 100 cases that come through. So, if 
you've got 15 trials, you're talking about 500 cases." 
</P>
<P>
The judge praised Monday's appointees as "a delightful group" and said those 
promoted from the Municipal Court will "be on line as quickly as I can get them 
to move upstairs." 
</P>
<P>
Marc Adelman, president of the San Diego County Bar Assn., also lauded the new 
jurists and called the appointments "a major step toward easing the load" that 
has brought civil trials to a virtual standstill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Next Step 
</P>
<P>
"It's sure going to be a big help, " Adelman said. "The next step is more 
appointments and more courtrooms." 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Huff, an attorney with Gray, Cary, Ames &amp; Frye, noted that two of 
the new judges -- Tobin and Riddle -- have significant civil law experience. In 
the past, some lawyers have criticized the governor -- the state's former 
Attorney General -- for appointing too many ex-prosecutors and neglecting to 
name civil attorneys to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"It really is an excellent group," Huff said. "I would prefer to see a woman 
among them . . . but there are strong credentials here. Mainly what we needed 
were more judges." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, 37, of Chula Vista, was appointed to the San Diego Municipal Court 
by Deukmejian in 1986. Before that, the University of San Diego graduate was a 
deputy in the local attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
Boyle, 49, of San Diego, has been a Municipal judge since 1987. Boyle worked as 
a prosecutor in the district attorney's office 14 years. He is a graduate of 
the University of Connecticut and USD. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Judge Since 1985 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, 42, has been a judge since 1985. The Spring Valley resident was an 
assistant U. S. attorney in San Diego from 1979 until 1985. He is a graduate of 
California State University, Los Angeles, and South Bay University Law School. 
</P>
<P>
Riddle, 50, of Coronado, was named to the Municipal Court in 1987. Before that, 
he was a lawyer in private practice in San Diego. He is a graduate of Yale 
University and the University of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Tobin, 50, of La Mesa, has been with the law firm of Knutson, Tobin, Meyer 
&amp; Shannon since 1967. He is a graduate of Princeton University and UCLA, 
and former president of the county Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, he said he was gratified by the appointment and eager 
to don the judicial robe. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very pleased and anxious to get to work at the job," said Tobin, a 
captain in the Navy reserves who is serving a two-week stint in Washington. "It 
seems to be the right move now." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Formed Law Firm 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill, 48, of San Diego, was a municipal judge from 1978 until 1980 and a 
Superior Court judge from 1980 until 1986. In 1986, he decided he needed a 
change and formed a law firm with Craig McClellan, where he practiced civil law 
in 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of the University of San Francisco, O'Neill was appointed to the 
Municipal and Superior courts the first time by former Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) 
Brown Jr. Before becoming a judge, O'Neill was a prosecutor 11 years . 
</P>
<P>
Also appointed to the court was Michael D. Wellington, 43, of San Diego. 
Wellington has been a supervising deputy attorney general in San Diego since 
1971. He is a graduate of San Diego State University and USD. 
</P>
<P>
After his swearing-in Monday, Wellington said he was "very proud" of the 
opportunity to serve as a judge and "anxious to do something different after 18 
years" with the attorney general's office. 
</P>

CLEANUP OF TOXICS AT CHATHAM SITE MAY START IN DECEMBER, COST LESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cleanup of the notorious Chatham Brothers toxic waste site in Escondido should 
begin by the end of the year, for 10% of the previously estimated cost, state 
health officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough in the long-stalled cleanup came after officials, in 
bureaucratic language, redefined the toxic material at the site. The new 
definition of the waste material will enable the state to simply dump the 
tainted soil at a hazardous-waste landfill -- at a cost of about $200,000 -- 
rather than incinerate the toxins, at a cost of about $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Marxen, spokesman for the toxic substances division of the State Department 
of Health Services, acknowledged that earlier promises to clean up the site had 
been unfulfilled, and cautioned again: 
</P>
<P>
"We've made promises in the past, and we're not making any promises this time, 
but we think the way is clear for us to clean it up now." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Site Identified in 1982 
</P>
<P>
Cleanup of the 7-acre site, at the corner of Bernardo Avenue and Gamble Lane in 
rural southwestern Escondido, has been targeted by state and county officials 
since the property was first declared a toxic waste site by the state in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
But the cleanup, which was stalled by litigation, was jeopardized last year 
when the state found it had spent virtually all its toxic-site cleanup funds 
before it was able to make significant headway at the Chatham site. The land is 
tainted with PCBs, heavy metals and oil, the result of a 40-year liquid-solvent 
and waste-oil recycling operation conducted by Robert and Thomas Chatham until 
about 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Cleanup cost was estimated at $2 million because it was assumed that the 
Chatham waste was regulated by the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery 
Act and had to be incinerated. Yet, only $1 million is now available for the 
Chatham site. 
</P>
<P>
Marxen said Monday that investigators, who have defined residual chemicals 
found at the site, are unable to technically categorize the original form and 
sources of the waste. Since it is unclear whether the original material falls 
within federal toxic guidelines, officials decided that the tainted soil could 
be trucked to a hazardous-waste landfill, at a fraction of the cost. The 
closest such landfill is in Imperial County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Checked Records 
</P>
<P>
Marxen said the state attorney general's office, which previously had pursued 
litigation on the cleanup against the Chatham brothers, investigated how the 
waste material was received by the Chathams. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the past two months," he said, "we've done an exhaustive search of those 
records and found we could not trace the materials the Chatham brothers 
received. We can't determine if it was waste -- or whether it was an actual 
product . . . that would go back on the market. 
</P>
<P>
"Since we couldn't declare it to be waste, the EPA (Environmental Protection 
Agency) staffers told us on an informal basis that we don't have to declare it 
regulated" by federal disposal guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Marxen said tests still need to be conducted -- including the boring of 
water-monitoring wells -- to determine whether the ground water is tainted by 
toxins that might have migrated off the site, toward Lake Hodges to the south. 
So far, however, there have been no such indications. 
</P>
<P>
Ground-water monitoring, further soil sampling and air monitoring will begin by 
mid-April, Marxen said, with completion expected by October. 
</P>
<P>
If the ground water is found to be contaminated and migrating off site, Marxen 
said, the site will be declared an "imminent and substantial endangerment," and 
cleanup will begin immediately after the finding. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming no such urgency is warranted, actual removal work is expected to begin 
by mid-December and be completed by next January, Marxen said. 
</P>
<P>
Health officials were unable to make their finding about the nature of the 
toxic material before now, Marxen said, "because the records were embargoed in 
the attorney general's office during their own investigation to determine who 
the responsible parties were." 
</P>
<P>
The state ultimately was left with the problem.

MAN CHARGED IN 12 RAPES RECONSIDERS GUILTY PLEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a surprise move, sentencing for the man known as the "bolder-than-most" 
rapist was continued on Monday after the defendant told a Superior Court judge 
that he was rethinking his decision last month to plead guilty to a series of 
sexual assaults that terrorized women throughout the San Diego area. 
</P>
<P>
Alvin Quarles, 26, of Paradise Hills had agreed to a plea bargain in which he 
admitted guilt to 12 felony charges in return for a prison sentence of 50 
years. 
</P>
<P>
But, on Monday, when he was scheduled to be sentenced, his attorney, Charles 
Adair, announced that Quarles wanted more time to consider the guilty plea 
because he felt 50 years was too long a sentence. Adair said Quarles would have 
to serve about half of the 50 years before he would even be eligible for 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
But the alternative, a jury trial, could lead to a maximum sentence of more 
than 200 years in prison, and Quarles might be required to serve up to 60 years 
of that sentence before being eligible for parole, Adair said. 
</P>
<P>
"He would have ended up doing 50 to 60 years or dying in prison," the attorney 
said. "Unless he got a pardon. You'd have to ask the governor about that, and, 
when it comes to sex cases, I'm not aware of any sympathetic ear in the 
governor's office." 
</P>
<P>
Judge Jesus Rodriguez set a new court date of March 20, at which time Quarles 
is to either formally ask to withdraw his guilty plea and seek a jury trial or 
proceed with the 50-year sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
Adair said Quarles was at one time charged with 61 counts in attacks that 
occurred in National City, Clairemont, Mission Valley and East San Diego, 
dating back to September, 1987. He was dubbed the "bolder-than-most" rapist by 
police for his tendency to sexually attack women even if others, such as 
roommates or spouses, were present.

COMPUTER HACKER FOUND LIVING ON THE STREETS; 
</P>
<P>
JUDGE LETS LANDRETH OFF PROBATION AFTER VIOLATION LANDS HIM IN COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE WOLF, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Famed teen-age computer hacker William Troy Landreth, who disappeared last year 
without explanation, was arrested last week in San Diego on a federal warrant 
for violating probation. 
</P>
<P>
Landreth, now 24, had been living on the streets of downtown San Diego as a 
drifter with no permanent address. Police stopped him for an unknown minor 
violation March 1, then ran a warrant check and discovered Landreth was wanted. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, U. S. District Judge Rudi Brewster took pity on the convicted 
computer hacker and terminated his probation, which was to have lasted until 
Nov. 16. "The judge concluded that his attempt to give some assistance, 
guidance and constructive help simply wasn't working in the context of the 
criminal justice system," said Peter Hughes, Landreth's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Landreth was released from the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Known as the 'Cracker' 
</P>
<P>
Landreth, once known as the "Cracker," was convicted at age 19 of tapping into 
a large corporation's electronic mail network from his Poway home. He had also 
entered systems run by the Department of Defense and NASA. In November, 1984, 
Brewster sentenced the baby-faced youth, with an IQ of 163, to three years' 
probation and ordered him to complete high school. 
</P>
<P>
Landreth at first complied with the judge's orders, but mysteriously 
disappeared two years later. He surfaced in June, 1987, in a small town in 
Oregon and was arrested for probation violation. A U. S. marshal said Landreth 
was dirty, without shoes and dressed shabbily at the time of his arrest in 
McMinnville, near Portland. 
</P>
<P>
Landreth was returned to San Diego and given additional probation. There were 
no mishaps until Landreth missed an appointment with his probation officer last 
Sept. 21. When Landreth didn't turn up after several months, Brewer issued a 
warrant for his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Bumming Around' 
</P>
<P>
Hughes, who has represented Landreth in federal court since his 1984 arrest, 
said Landreth has been on the streets for some time, "just sort of bumming 
around." Landreth had been approached several times by police for minor 
violations, such as jaywalking and loitering, Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
Police records show Landreth was contacted by police on a narcotics charge in 
September, according to police spokesman Bill Robinson. Landreth was also 
issued a citation for crossing the street against a red light last month, 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes said Landreth began living on the streets by choice, after there was a 
fire in the apartment he previously occupied. "He says he has been able to earn 
some money and is not destitute. . . . He is capable of generating some 
income." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spreading Knowledge 
</P>
<P>
After his arrest in 1984, Landreth wrote a book about his computer capers and 
made a living by telling other potential corporate victims how to protect their 
computers from people like him. 
</P>
<P>
In court Monday, Landreth said he intended to do more writing about computers 
and said he believes he would be able to turn his life around and accomplish 
something positive, according to Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
"The judge said he didn't know that continuing probation was really going to 
accomplish anything, and he basically wished Landreth well," Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes said that, even in the earlier court case, Brewster had attempted to 
guide the troubled genius in a fatherly way, rather than punish him. "The judge 
was not being punitive -- just the opposite," Hughes said. "He was trying to 
fashion some type of program that might give Landreth motivation for getting 
his life together." 
</P>
<P>
Hughes said he believed the justice system had done all it could to help 
Landreth. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we had really exhausted what can be done," Hughes said. "We were 
trying to be his parents, and we can't be. This is really no longer something 
that the criminal justice system can accomplish."

VAN DE KAMP URGES CURB ON UTILITIES' PUC CONTACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp on Monday proposed that San Diego Gas &amp; 
Electric and Southern California Edison officials be prohibited from making 
off-the-record contacts with state Public Utilities Commission members and 
staffers during the PUC's upcoming review of the proposed merger of the two 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp's standard would be significantly stricter than the limited ban 
that PUC Administrative Law Judge Lynn Carew recently proposed. Carew's 
proposal would allow utility personnel to make off-the-record contacts with 
commissioners as long as those comments were reported to other parties in a 
timely manner. Carew's proposed rule evidently would not prohibit 
off-the-record contact with PUC staff members, according to Van de Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
The PUC is expected to adopt Carew's proposed rule later this month. The PUC, 
which operates independently from Van de Kamp's office, is not obligated to 
adopt the attorney general's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sunshine Rules 
</P>
<P>
The stricter rule should be adopted because "the PUC's decision on the proposed 
merger will directly affect millions of Californians," Van de Kamp said in a 
prepared release. "Behind-the-scenes lobbying should have no place in the 
resolution of this issue." 
</P>
<P>
The PUC has in the past adopted "sunshine" rules during major proceedings 
involving utilities. Carew agreed to limit contact with commissioners after 
receiving a complaint from consumer group leaders, including Michael Shames, 
executive director of Utility Consumers Action Network, a San Diego-based 
consumer group. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp's proposed rule would "make the PUC play it the way that the courts 
and all other administrative agencies play it," Shames said Monday. "He's asked 
that they ban behind-the-scenes communications outright, and that they forget 
this ridiculous rule about reporting conversations after the fact." 
</P>
<P>
"That's something I've called for for a long time," Shames said. "But it seems 
to fall upon deaf ears at the PUC."

LESBIAN GETS 25 YEARS FOR SLAYING WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lesbian sailor who was convicted of murdering another woman in a love 
triangle was sentenced Monday to 25 years to life in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
Sherral Lyn Clayton, 25, of Lemon Grove was given the term for the Oct. 7 
slaying of Shelly Dupee, 21, who was found stabbed 54 times, with her throat 
slashed, in her Spring Valley apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa Chappell said in court last month that Clayton "killed 
the competition" because both women had been dating a third woman. 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court jury convicted Clayton of first-degree murder Feb. 2 after 
deliberating 2 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Clayton testified that she killed Dupee in self-defense after Dupee attacked 
her, saying: "You're not going to take Debbie away from me." Clayton was 
arrested at a hospital, where she received six stitches for cuts to her 
fingers. 
</P>
<P>
Clayton had worked as a jet mechanic and had been in the Navy for eight years, 
according to the probation report. 
</P>
<P>
The "other woman" listed in the report said her relationship with Clayton ended 
a month and a half before the slaying because of her interest in Dupee.

WRITERS' VIEWS OF RUSHDIE BOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I fully agree with Richard Rodriguez ("Baiting Religion, American Style," 
Editorial Page, Feb. 25) for saying what the American Muslims have been saying 
all along. He said, "To reiterate blasphemy through a microphone seems to me a 
provocation. I do believe that American writers believe that they are 
protesting censorship. But should one not question the propriety of giving 
further offense to Islam?" 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie has written a blasphemous book and has committed a grave folly. He now 
realizes it. The writers are displaying malice and contempt for Islam and 
Muslims by their overindulgence in reading Rushdie's book. This insult is not 
acceptable to the Muslims living in the United States and Canada. We are 
outraged and at the same time dismayed. If the PEN members think that they are 
protesting Khomeini's proclamation, then why don't they show a little courage 
and go to an Asian country and read the book.

THE ISSUE NOT FOR BURNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Satanic Verses" fury flew out of literary circles, whirled into a death 
sentence from the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, erupted as riots in Muslim 
nations, exploded into U.S. bookstore bombings and landed locally on Los 
Angeles talk-radio, where one morning host has left the air and another is 
supposed to demolish some material Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Talk-radio, for those of you who prefer music and news, can function as a 
relief tube for the angry and oppressed, allowing anonymous listeners -- first 
name only, please -- to spill passions in public without fear of being 
recognizable or responsible. Talk-radio is everyday testimony to the virtue of 
the First Amendment -- and to the vituperative power of mean spirits lacking 
other outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Talk-radio hosts are more than mere receptionists. Some, like the late Joe 
Pyne, one of the founding fathers of the form, turn antagonism into contumely. 
Others, like KABC's Michael Jackson, use the two-way format as a sort of issues 
swap meet. Most of them never hesitate to have their own opinions and some of 
them bait callers to raise the ratings or the level of outrage. 
</P>
<P>
Outrage was easy on talk-radio in the case of Salman Rushdie, "The Satanic 
Verses" author condemned by the Ayatollah for having blasphemed the Muslim 
faith. Nobody had to read the novel before forming a bias. Outrage became 
easier when a fomer pop music peacenik of a decade ago -- Cat Stevens, now 
renamed Yousuf Islam -- affirmed the Ayatollah's deadly interpretation of the 
Koran. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Tom Leykis, the evening drive-time voice of station KFI (640 AM). Leykis 
was whipping loyal listeners into an anti-Stevens lather a coupleof weeks ago 
when a man called to suggest that Cat Stevens recordings be burned, not merely 
banned. Leykis liked the idea and began making plans for a whopping blaze, 
asking listeners to bring Stevens artifacts down to the station. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Geoff Edwards, the mid-morning voice of KFI; he didn't like the idea and 
he smelled a form of 1930s fascism in the proposed burning. Edwards finally 
quit KFI rather than have the Leykis fire fanned by spot announcements during 
the Edwards broadcast hours. 
</P>
<P>
Leykis, meanwhile, was having his own troubles. The South Coast Air Quality 
Management District told him any such symbolic pyre might have an environmental 
impact and had to have a permit. And some listeners were starting to complain 
that destroying the Cat Stevens recorded library was what a despot would do. So 
Leykis issued an invitation over the air, promising that the destruction ritual 
would be replaced by a great First Amendment celebration if enough movie or 
music stars called to participate. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of last week, only Rae Dawn Chong and Steve Allen had apparently 
volunteered, and Leykis was complaining about not hearing anything from the 
outspoken likes of Robert Redford, Jane Fonda or Ed Asner. The fire, he said, 
was out. A steamroller would substitute at a site to be announced. No more 
record ashes; instead, record dust. 
</P>
<P>
For a time we hoped Geoff Edwards could clear the air. For now we will not 
listen to Ayatollah threats, old Cat Stevens music or further promotion of a 
demolition spectacle. We do not deny Leykis' right to feed the frenzies as long 
as no one gets hurt. We do deny wanting to help fight fanaticism with fire -- 
or even steamrollers.

WILDLIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial "Pets in the Wild?" (Feb. 23) about the problems wildlife in 
Yellowstone National Park are experiencing is right on. 
</P>
<P>
The area of the park boundaries enclose is not a complete ecosystem, and 
therein lies the problem. Until Congress acts to buy up and take over the 
surrounding private holdings and national forest lands the rancher-hunters will 
"harvest" every animal that moves over the park borders; nor will a natural 
balance of park wildlife be reestablished unless the predatory wolf is restored 
to Yellowstone. 
</P>
<P>
These days, we know that the wolf is not the big bad beast of the fairy tales 
and it is time Congress stopped believing these fairy tales.

<TEXT>
<P>
In his column, Mailer took the opportunity of Rushdie's misfortune to harp on 
his own unfounded personal gripes. I take offense at his trumped-up statistics 
that claim that booksellers are not in danger as a result of making Rushdie's 
book available to the public, and his implications that even if they were, no 
one should mind, because the average bookseller (or is it one out of six?) 
doesn't know a book from a can of soup, or Saul Bellow from the average peon. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Mailer himself walked into my bookstore, slapped down his Visa and 
demanded Tom Wolfe's latest work, I would treat him just like everyone else. Of 
course, Mailer might not want to go shopping in South Coast Plaza. As I write 
this, the police have come to question our manager about her procedure in the 
case of a bomb threat. One of the other bookstores in this mall has received 
one, and we have to be ready for anything. 
</P>
<P>
Waldenbooks has never ceased to carry the book, but like any controversial 
material, it has been handled carefully. It has been and will always be for 
sale at our store. Even for Norman Mailer.

LAWMAKER'S CHILD FACES JAIL OVER TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS

Assemblywoman Cathie Wright's daughter failed to inform the Ventura County 
Municipal Court about new three traffic offenses, as required, after a 
municipal judge placed her on probation and gave her a 30-day suspended jail 
sentence for numerous moving violations, the judge said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria Catherine Wright, 24, was told by Judge Herbert Curtis III on April 18 
that another conviction would result in a jail stint. He fined her, placed her 
on probation for three years and stipulated that she inform the court of future 
offenses within 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) said Monday that her daughter acted on the advice 
of her attorney when she failed to heed the court order. The attorney, however, 
said he never gave Wright's daughter such counsel. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury said that his office, 
which opened an investigation last week of allegations that Wright sought "to 
influence the outcome" of her daughter's citations, had received new leads. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One Complaint 
</P>
<P>
The inquiry was triggered by a single complainant, Bradbury said Monday, but 
"there are now numerous sources of information that are pertinent to our 
investigation." He declined to disclose the identities of the assemblywoman's 
accusers or to reveal details of the probe. 
</P>
<P>
Cathie Wright reiterated that she has done nothing improper in contacting Simi 
Valley, Ventura County and state Department of Motor Vehicles officials on 
behalf her daughter. She has suggested that Bradbury is trying to score 
political points at her expense. 
</P>
<P>
"When does your child not become your constituent?" Wright asked. "Where do you 
draw the line?" 
</P>
<P>
State DMV officials say that Wright sought no preferential treatment for her 
daughter, despite the lawmaker's intervention, and that Victoria Wright 
received none. 
</P>
<P>
James E. Dunn, a traffic safety manager, was dispatched from Sacramento to hold 
an administrative hearing for the younger Wright in Van Nuys in July after the 
assemblywoman sent a letter to DMV Director A.A. (Del) Pierce on her daughter's 
behalf. Dunn, who reviews DMV appeals for Pierce, overturned a decision by a 
DMV hearing officer a month earlier to suspend Victoria Wright's license for 
six months. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Dunn gave her a six-month license restricted to traveling to and from 
work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
11 Violations 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the July hearing, the younger Wright had been convicted of 11 
traffic violations in the previous 18 months, including 10 for speeding. Her 
four points for four speeding offenses in the previous 12 months had led to the 
June suspension. 
</P>
<P>
In overturning the suspension, Dunn said Monday that he took into account the 
fact that Victoria Wright had never been convicted of driving under the 
influence of drugs or alcohol, had never had a violation expunged from her 
record by attending traffic violators' school, had only been brought before the 
court one time and vowed that she "had grown up" and would not to break the law 
again. 
</P>
<P>
He said overturning the suspension was not unusually lenient treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Cathie Wright said Monday that her June 22 letter to Pierce "was basically a 
form letter in which you ask for an administrative review." She said she would 
have sent it for any constituent. 
</P>
<P>
"My daughter's presently suffering from financial hardships and must continue 
working to alleviate the situation," said the letter requesting a restricted 
license. "She is unable to get to her place of employment except by car." 
</P>
<P>
Victoria Wright lives with her mother in Simi Valley and works in a supermarket 
in Thousand Oaks. Cathie Wright's political colleagues say that the lawmaker, 
whose husband died in 1982, has long complained of problems with her only 
child. Said one: "This is part of an ongoing saga." 
</P>
<P>
After the July hearing, Victoria Wright subsequently received tickets for five 
additional moving violations, including three more for speeding, and faces a 
one-year revocation of her license at a hearing scheduled for Wednesday. Dunn 
said she also failed to keep a spoken agreement to alert him to any new 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis, who had placed Victoria Wright on a court-ordered probation in April, 
said Monday that he only learned of the additional offenses from a newspaper 
reporter last week. He said he expects Victoria Wright to be brought back 
before him in two weeks to a month for sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Cathie Wright had sought to intercede in the case, Curtis cited 
Bradbury's investigation and declined comment. Wright said she had never spoken 
to Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmaker, who said she was speaking for her daughter, recalled that 
Victoria Wright wanted to contact Curtis when she got two more tickets in 
September and a third in December but found herself "caught between a rock and 
a hard place." 
</P>
<P>
Wright said her daughter "was taking the advice of the attorney who appeared 
with her at that time not to say anything." Wright said the lawyer, Frederick 
Rosenmund, told her daughter: "Let the judge take action." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Denies Advice 
</P>
<P>
But Rosenmund, who represented Victoria Wright before Curtis, said Monday that 
he never gave such advice. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something that I wouldn't do if I knew there was a court order to report 
additional violations," Rosenmund said. He said such a requirement is "often a 
standard term of probation." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenmund, who has a practice in Oxnard, is an attorney that Assembly Speaker 
Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) recommended to Cathie Wright last year. 
</P>
<P>
Cathie Wright acknowledged Monday that she also called John Paventi, a Ventura 
County Municipal Court commissioner, about Victoria's September tickets. 
Paventi is a former Republican Party official whom Wright recalled supporting 
in his bid to become a judge. He subsequently disqualified himself from hearing 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
"Vicki wanted to fight" the tickets, Wright said, explaining her contact with 
Paventi. "I called him and asked him what the procedures would be and he 
suggested she just pay the tickets. And he decided he would not have anything 
to do with the case . . . 
</P>
<P>
"He would have done that if Vicki had just walked in. He knows her." 
</P>
<P>
Paventi could not be reached Monday.

MOTHER, SON SHOT IN DISPUTE WITH FATHER OVER DOG 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A dispute between a Canoga Park man and his 10-year-old son over a mess made by 
a pet puppy escalated into a family argument in which a handgun held by the man 
went off and his wife and son were injured, Los Angeles police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, Randy Nater, was in stable but guarded condition at Humana Hospital 
West Hills after being shot in the abdomen at 7:30 p.m. Sunday at his home in 
the 23300 block of Welby Way, police said. The boy's mother, Lylliam Nater, 33, 
was treated at the hospital for a graze wound in the neck and was released. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Nater, 32, was arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon after 
the shooting. He was released on $12,000 bail Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Though both parents said the shooting was an accident, the case will be 
presented to the Los Angeles County district attorney's office for possible 
filing of charges against Joel Nater, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred during an argument begun when Joel Nater told Randy, one 
of the couple's four young sons, to clean up a mess the boys' puppy had made in 
a bathroom at the home, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Duane Burris said that Randy refused to do the cleaning and that he 
was spanked by his father. Lylliam Nater grew angry over the disciplining of 
the child and began arguing with her husband, police said. She then called 
relatives on the phone to complain about her husband, police said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Entered Bedroom 
</P>
<P>
"The next thing you know, he went into a bedroom and got the gun," Lt. William 
Gaida said. "He was waving it around and was angry." 
</P>
<P>
While Joel Nater was in one room with the gun and his wife and son were in 
another room, the gun discharged and a bullet struck the corner of the room, 
police said. Fragments of the bullet went through the wall and struck the woman 
and child in the other room, Burris said. The three other boys, ages 5, 8 and 
11, were in the house but were not injured. 
</P>
<P>
"The father is saying it was an accident," Gaida said. "The mother says it was 
an accident. It will be reviewed." 
</P>
<P>
Police said that if Joel Nater is not charged with assault, he could face a 
lesser charge.

NATIONAL PARK SERVICE ACQUIRES CIRCLE X RANCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a ceremony punctuated by bagpipe music and blue skies, a state parks agency 
turned over 2,434 acres of Santa Monica Mountains parkland to the National Park 
Service on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The cornerstone of the $11-million land sale by the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy was the site of the ceremony, the 1,655-acre Circle X Ranch in 
southeast Ventura County. The ranch and 779 acres in Zuma Canyon were added to 
the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
Sandstone Peak, part of the ranch and the highest point in the Santa Monicas, 
loomed in the background as Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley and Democratic and 
Republican members of Congress praised the conservancy and the Park Service for 
preserving the land and the national park. 
</P>
<P>
The park has received about $91 million of the $150 million in land-purchasing 
funds envisioned by the 1978 law that created it, partly because some in 
Congress have been skeptical about whether a true wilderness park could be 
created in a sprawling urban area such as Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"One look at this property should put to rest all of those doubts," Rep. 
Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Tarzana), author of the 1978 law, told a crowd of about 
175. "It gives the Santa Monicas the look and feel of a real national park. 
That's important from a political perspective." 
</P>
<P>
The $11 million represented all of the money Congress appropriated to the Park 
Service for the Santa Monicas in the 1989 budget year. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an amazing grace to this lovely area," said U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson 
(R-Calif.), after bagpiper Jim Sanderson of Long Beach played the song "Amazing 
Grace." 
</P>
<P>
The Circle X Ranch becomes the first overnight campground in the national park. 
</P>
<P>
The land in Zuma Canyon adds to existing federal parkland there, bringing to 
1,500 the number of public acres -- including hiking and horse trails -- in the 
coastal canyon. With the latest acquisitions, the national park has about 
16,000 acres of federal land from the Hollywood Freeway to Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agoura Development 
</P>
<P>
The dedication came less than a week after the park sustained a setback from 
the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, which approved a 150-home 
development Thursday on land in Agoura that park officials had coveted. 
</P>
<P>
Although conservancy officials said they have not yet given up on acquiring the 
property, Conservancy Executive Director Joseph T. Edmiston said: "If there 
ever was a need to show that the park is not moribund as a result of the 
supervisors' action, today was a demonstration of that." 
</P>
<P>
The state law that created the conservancy to manage parkland until the federal 
government can take it over is scheduled to expire in July, 1990. State Sen. 
Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles) is expected to introduce a bill this week to 
extend the life of the conservancy until the end of 1994, a Rosenthal aide said 
Monday.

NEWBORN BOY FOUND IN BAG NEAR TRASH CANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A newborn baby boy was found abandoned in a plastic bag early Monday near some 
North Hollywood trash cans, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Three men collecting cans, bottles and cardboard for recycling found the baby, 
still covered with blood and with its umbilical cord and placenta attached, 
after they saw the plastic bag move and heard crying, Detective Jorge Armenta 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The child was found at about 4:30 a.m. in the 6300 block of Camellia Avenue 
near Sylvan Street, a neighborhood of single-family homes, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics took the child to Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills, where 
officials said he was suffering from hypothermia. Armenta said the child was in 
good condition. 
</P>
<P>
The infant will be placed in the custody of the Los Angeles County Department 
of Children's Services when he is released from the hospital.

MAN FACES FELONY TRIAL IN CRASH THAT KILLED 3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 22-year-old Los Angeles man must stand trial on felony vehicular manslaughter 
charges in a traffic accident that killed an 11-month-old baby and his 
grandparents, a Van Nuys Municipal Court judge ruled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Several witnesses testified at a preliminary hearing that the defendant, 
Gregory Masterson Michael, was driving at speeds up to 60 m.p.h. last October 
when he ran a red light and hit the car in which the victims were riding. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Rochel, 84, of Beverly Hills; his wife, Ashraf, 71, and their 
grandson, Jonathan Rochel, died in the accident at Victory Boulevard and White 
Oak Avenue in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
The baby's mother, Fereshteh Rochel, 27, of Reseda, testified that she was 
driving the car and that her son and in-laws were riding in the back seat when 
the accident occurred. She said her car was hit as she was trying to make a 
left turn from White Oak Avenue onto Victory Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Michael's attorney, James M. Epstein, admitted that his client caused the 
accident, but said Michael should have been charged with misdemeanor vehicular 
manslaughter because the prosecution had failed to prove gross negligence as 
required for felony charges. 
</P>
<P>
However, Judge Beauford H. Phelps agreed with the prosecutor, Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Phillip H. Rabichow, that Michael should face the three felony counts. 
Michael must enter a plea to the charges March 20. If convicted, he could be 
sentenced to up to six years in prison on each of the three counts.

6 ALISO HIGH STUDENTS FINISH L.A. MARATHON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six students from Aliso High School, who put in extra hours during the last 
seven months training for the Los Angeles Marathon, finished Sunday's grueling 
26.2-mile race, their teacher and coach said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We did it," said Paul Trapani, the social studies teacher who ran with the 
students after school and on weekends. "We are feeling a little wounded but 
very proud." 
</P>
<P>
The students, who transferred to the Reseda continuation high school after 
experiencing attendance and behavior problems at other schools, signed up for 
Trapani's fitness class last September. The class required students to train 
daily and to complete at least two 10-kilometer races. 
</P>
<P>
The student times ranged from a little more than five hours to nearly seven 
hours, Trapani said. "We stressed that the important thing was to just cross 
the finish line," he said.

SIMI OFFICIALS MAKE FINAL PITCH FOR SCHOOL BOND MEASURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Simi Valley school officials are making a last-minute effort to get out the 
vote and win passage of $43 million in school bonds when voters go to the polls 
today for a special election. 
</P>
<P>
The vote caps an aggressive campaign to inform voters of the 27-school 
district's need for more money for a new set of three R's -- renovation, 
rehabilitation and restoration -- to go along with reading, writing and 
arithmetic, said Chet Howe, assistant to the superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
Howe said volunteers telephoned voters Monday night and will be poll-watching 
and telephoning this afternoon as well to remind people to vote in favor of 
Measure A and Measure B. 
</P>
<P>
A $35-million bond issue failed by 147 votes in April, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Citizens Committee 
</P>
<P>
A citizens committee supporting the measures recruited more than 200 volunteers 
and raised more than $6,000 to hire a political consultant and pay for other 
campaign expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone needs a ride to the polls, we're going to take them there," Howe 
said. "If someone needs a reminder to vote, they're going to get a call." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, property tax rates will actually go down if both measures pass. 
Legislation sponsored by Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) and signed 
into law last month extends the district's repayment of its existing state 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, even with payments for the new bonds, the annual school taxes on a 
$100,000 home would drop from $113 per year to $88 per year. Tax rates would 
drop again after 1994, when the state loan is to be repaid. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$35 Million 
</P>
<P>
Measure A, if passed, would provide the district with $35 million, much of 
which would be spent on air conditioning and heating. The rest of the money 
would be spent on plumbing, roofing and asphalt repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Measure B, which will not go into effect unless Measure A is also approved, 
would provide the district with $8 million to construct three new junior high 
school gymnasiums and an auditorium at a fourth junior high. 
</P>
<P>
Each measure must be approved by more than two-thirds of the voters to gain 
passage. No organized opposition to the bond issues has emerged during the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we are going to be successful," Howe said. "We feel that this year we 
have informed more people on more issues and we hope they understand the needs 
and will rally around their community responsibility."

</P>
<P>
Northridge (21-8), which finished second in the California Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. and is ranked 14th in the nation, will play at 6 p.m. in Kellogg Gym. 
Third-ranked Pomona, which defeated Northridge, 75-62, on Saturday to win its

NOTRE DAME STUNS CHATSWORTH, 6-5

<P>
Notre Dame High rallied for two runs in each of the last three innings Monday 
to shock Chatsworth, 6-5, in the second round of the Westside baseball 
tournament at Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights' victory, however, was not without controversy, which was generated 
by a fifth-inning balk by Chatsworth right-hander Reed McMackin that resulted 
in Notre Dame's second run. 
</P>
<P>
With two out and Chatsworth leading, 4-1, Notre Dame's Vinnie Orlando was 
allowed to score from third after McMackin halted his wind-up. The second base 
umpire made the call, unaware that the home plate umpire had apparently raised 
his hand to signal time out. 
</P>
<P>
"You put your hand up!" said Chatsworth Coach Bob Lofrano, who protested for 
five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Said Lofrano afterward: "He agreed that he put up his hand. He justified it by 
saying he didn't yell, 'Time!' " 
</P>
<P>
Said McMackin: "I'm in my wind-up, I take a step back, drop my head like I 
always do and when I look up his hand is up. There is no reason anybody -- I 
don't care who you are -- stops in the middle of a wind-up with a runner at 
third base." 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame Coach Bob Mandeville seemed to agree. "If an umpire raises a hand to 
my pitcher, I expect my pitcher to stop." 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame sophomore right-hander Cary Wichman stopped Chatsworth with an 
effective curve. Wichman struggled early, as Chatsworth (1-1) struck for two 
first-inning runs on two hits. Wichman (1-0), however, went the distance, 
scattering four hits. 
</P>
<P>
"The curve was working real good," Wichman said. "We mixed it in a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth scored two runs in the fourth inning to take a 4-0 lead. Senior 
Kevin Chong, who was three for four, singled to right field to drive in 
pinch-runner Chris Husted from third. The ball rolled between the legs of right 
fielder Chris Prince, allowing Nick Schultz to score from first. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame (2-0) parlayed three singles into two sixth-inning runs to tie the 
score. Chatsworth added an unearned run in the bottom half of the sixth, but 
Notre Dame scored twice in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
With two out and runners on first and third, Notre Dame's Kevin Milligan 
reached base when catcher Eric Johnson dropped what would have been a 
game-ending third strike from reliever Jason Evans (0-1). Chris Lohman scored 
from third. 
</P>
<P>
Prince then atoned for his error with a single to score Bobby Hughes with the 
winning run. VINCE KOWALICK

The dollar advanced against most major currencies except the British pound and 
Canadian dollar in choppy trading Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices rose in domestic trading after a mixed performance overseas. 
Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid of $387.30 an ounce, $1 
higher than Friday's late bid. 
</P>
<P>
Zlatko Glamuzina, chief currency dealer at the New York office of Banco di 
Sicilia, said the dollar benefited from improvements in the stock and bond 
markets and rising oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
Snow in New York on Monday kept some dealers away and persuaded others to end 
their business days early, which made for a thin market, Glamuzina said. In a 
thin market, individual trades can have an exaggerated impact on prices. 
</P>
<P>
European dealers said the market lacked much incentive to do anything other 
than explore the dollar's recent ranges. They said the market may get direction 
from Friday's Labor Department report on February unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost $1.7210 to buy 
one pound, cheaper than $1.7240 late Friday. Later in New York, however, 
sterling strengthened a bit and a pound cost $1.72335, up from $1.72025 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
dropped 0.49 Japanese yen to a closing 127.63 yen. Later, in London, it was 
quoted at 128.80 yen and at 129.15 late in New York's day, up from 127.815 on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to Friday's levels, included: 
1.85275 West German marks, up from 1.8437; 1.58575 Swiss francs, up from 
1.57515; 1.19235 Canadian dollars, down from 1.19505; 6.29725 French francs, up 
from 6.2645, and, 1,362.125 Italian lire, up from 1,358.00. 
</P>
<P>
Late dollar rates in Europe, compared to late Friday's rates, included: 1.8531 
West German marks, up from 1.8415; 1.5830 Swiss francs, up from 1.5765; 6.2955 
French francs, up from 6.2600; 2.0855 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0770; 1,359.25 
Italian lire, up from 1,358.75, and 1.1928 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1935. 
</P>
<P>
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery closed 
at $388 an ounce, up from Friday's $386.60. 
</P>
<P>
On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $5.809, 
compared to Friday's settlement of $5.801.

The stock market powered its way Monday to the third day of a winning streak, 
turning a stable morning rally into a roaring finish on strength in the dollar 
and bond markets. The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials rose 20.53 to 2,294.82. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by better than 2 to 1 in nationwide 
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 168.88 million shares, up from 151.79 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks drew strength from bonds, which more than recouped Friday's losses. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds rose on news that the economy cooled last month, alleviating upward 
pressure on interest rates. A report from the nation's purchasing managers said 
the economy's growth slowed to a two-year low in February, while employment 
slipped for the first time in nine months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trading Tentative 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the dollar surged on a report in Tokyo quoting a senior Japanese 
finance official as saying that the dollar is trading near its bottom and that 
a stronger yen is not needed. "I think the market is being led by the strength 
in the dollar," said block trader Bob Grohskopf at Morgan Stanley. "We're 
having a very nice currency and bond market." 
</P>
<P>
"The economic news has become more mixed, with the purchasing agents saying 
that they're seeing signs of more moderate growth," added Mark Tavel, president 
of Rothschild Asset Management. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the Dow's gains, trading was still tentative ahead of Friday's report 
on February U.S. unemployment, which will tell more about the economic 
expansion and its implications for inflation, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
The big news of the session was the weekend merger agreement between Time Inc. 
and Warner Communications. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the deal immediately touched off speculation that other companies 
in the entertainment and publishing industries might be candidates for mergers 
or takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
Warner stock led the active list and jumped 2 3/8 to 48 1/4, while Time's 
shares dropped 1 5/8 to 107 1/2. Analysts said Time's decline in part reflected 
disappointment among traders who had been reckoning that the company might have 
become a takeover candidate at a higher price. 
</P>
<P>
Chris-Craft Industries, which owns a 17% interest in Warner, gained 3 3/4 to 33 
1/2. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reebok Active 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the communications and entertainment group, Gulf &amp; Western 
rose 2 1/2 to 45 7/8, MCA gained 2 1/8 to 53, Walt Disney added 1 1/4 to 77 
5/8, Orion Pictures jumped 1 1/8 to 16 7/8 and Columbia Pictures Entertainment 
rose 1 to 18 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
Reebok International, a maker of popular athletic shoes, rose 5/8 to 14 1/4 as 
the NYSE's third most active issue on takeover speculation, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilshire index of 5,000 equities closed at 2,912.439, up 28.321, or 0.98%, 
from Friday's close. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added 1.73 to 
165.63. 
</P>
<P>
Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 4.04 to 340.39; its 500-stock 
composite index was up 3.63 at 294.81. 
</P>
<P>
The NASDAQ composite index gained 2.27 to 406.26; the American Stock Exchange 
index closed at 327.99, up 1.77. 
</P>
<P>
In foreign trading, prices fell in light trading Monday on the Tokyo Stock 
Exchange as investors waited on the sidelines in anticipation of a drop in 
stock prices because of the settlement of March futures contracts. The Nikkei 
225-share index fell 123.24 to close at 31,876.86. 
</P>
<P>
However, share prices on the London Stock Exchange rose, but trading activity 
was thin, as players began casting a cautious eye toward next week's 
presentation of Britain's fiscal 1990 budget. At the close, the Financial Times 
100-share index was up 13.6, or 0.7%, at 2,072.8.

PLATINUM FUTURES GAIN ON BUYING BY JAPAN JEWELERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prices of platinum futures gained strongly Monday after a modest rally led by 
Japanese jewelry makers pushed prices through key resistance levels, triggering 
widespread buying. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, gold and silver futures also advanced, copper futures 
declined, energy futures gained, grains and soybeans were mostly higher and 
livestock and meat futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Platinum settled $7.40 to $8.30 higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange, 
with the contract for delivery in April at $546.70 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese commercial traders, who recently had been absent from the platinum 
market, began buying futures early in the session, which encouraged others to 
enter the market. 
</P>
<P>
The rally slowly gathered steam, then accelerated rapidly in afternoon trading 
after the April contract's price surpassed $544 an ounce, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"We hit buy stops right over that, ran up to $548, then pulled back," said 
Bette Raptopoulos, a metals market analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities 
Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Observers noted an easing of concern about the possibility that a strike in the 
base-metals section of South Africa's Rustenburg metals complex would spread to 
the platinum refinery, which processes about half of the world's platinum. 
</P>
<P>
"That's definitely a contributing factor but it's not as prominent as it was 
last week," said James Steel, an analyst with Refco in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Trading volume in precious metals futures was thin, both on the New York Merc 
and on New York's Commodity Exchange, where gold and silver futures are traded. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Copper Futures Slump 
</P>
<P>
Gold settled $1.10 to $1.20 higher with April at $390.50 an ounce; silver was 
0.6 to 0.8 cent higher with March at $5.809 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Copper futures retreated on the Commodity Exchange after five straight days of 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
The decline was linked to the London Metal Exchange's report of a relatively 
large, 4,500-ton increase last week in its warehouse stocks of copper, and to a 
337-ton increase over the weekend in warehouse stocks registered with the 
Commodity Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Copper settled 1.4 to 3.1 cents lower, with May at $1.42 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Oil futures climbed moderately higher on the New York Merc after an 
International Energy Agency report showing a reduction in crude oil output by 
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries last month. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Soviet energy officials said Monday that they were willing to extend 
a previously announced 5% cutback in crude oil production beyond the original 
six-month deadline in a bid to help boost prices. 
</P>
<P>
West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 11 to 21 cents higher, with April at 
$18.67 a barrel; heating oil was 0.32 to 0.63 cent higher, with April at 51.43 
cents a gallon, and unleaded gasoline was 0.06 to 0.87 cent higher, with April 
at 51.59 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat futures made solid gains on the Chicago Board of Trade after a weekend of 
drier-than-expected weather in the Great Plains, the heart of the winter-wheat 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat also was supported by reports that China was seeking to buy 400,000 
metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Livestock Prices Mixed 
</P>
<P>
Wheat settled 2.25 to 7.50 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in 
March at $4.35 a bushel; corn was 2 cents lower to 1.50 cents higher, with 
March at $2.7975 a bushel; oats were 2.50 to 4.25 cents higher, with March at 
$2.0975 a bushel, and soybeans were 2.75 to 8.50 cents higher, with March at 
$7.705 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
Livestock futures settled mixed in lackluster trading on the Chicago Mercantile 
Exchange. Frozen pork bellies finished sharply higher, erasing about half the 
losses sustained in last Friday's steep selloff. 
</P>
<P>
Live cattle were 0.15 cent lower to 0.12 cent higher, with April at 77.80 cents 
a pound; feeder cattle were 0.15 to 0.43 cent lower, with March at 82.10 cents 
a pound; live hogs were 0.28 cent lower to 0.52 cent higher, with April at 
43.87 cents a pound, and frozen pork bellies were 1.85 cent lower to 1.38 cent 
higher, with March at 38.95 cents a pound.

WOULDN'T DUMP REPOSSESSED REAL ESTATE; 
</P>
<P>
BUSH S&amp;L PLAN MAY RULE OUT FIRE SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration is considering an addition to its savings and loan plan 
that would be aimed at discouraging the government from dumping the repossessed 
real estate it inherits from failed institutions, an industry official said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials, in response to members of Congress worried about the 
potential of real estate fire sales, are examining proposals to combine federal 
and state money to pay for a real estate maintenance program, according to 
Kenneth A. Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Assn. 
of America. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the program, some of the real estate could be used for day-care 
centers, food programs or in some other way that meets President Bush's "kind, 
gentler" social objectives, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Thought is being given to it. Very, very, high-level thought," Guenther said. 
</P>
<P>
In other S&amp;L developments: 
</P>
<P>
* Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, (D-Tex.), chairman of the House Banking Committee, 
introduced the Administration's S&amp;L proposal in the House on Monday. It was 
referred to Gonzalez's committee, defusing a jurisdictional dispute between the 
banking panel and the House Ways and Means Committee that could have delayed 
congressional action. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, (D-Ill.), chairman of Ways and Means, had sought joint 
jurisdiction, arguing that a key element of the S&amp;L plan provided for 
raising money through bond sales and that his panel's turf covered revenue 
raising. 
</P>
<P>
* Six Washington-based "think tanks" -- ranging from the conservative Heritage 
Foundation to the liberal Brookings Institution -- issued a statement saying 
the Bush proposal doesn't provide enough money or reform. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez and other legislators from Texas are worried that if regulators try to 
sell off repossessed real estate too fast, it could collapse the already weak 
real estate market in the state. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the commercial bank regulator that under 
Bush's restructuring plan would also take the lead in resolving S&amp;L 
problems, has historically sold repossessed property faster than S&amp;L 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Guenther described the possible addition of a property management program to 
the Administration plan as a contingency rather than a Bush initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"They want their plan (S&amp;L) whole, but at the same time . . . if the 
Congress moves in this direction, they have to be prepared," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wants Flexibility 
</P>
<P>
An Administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the 
Administration wants to preserve regulators' discretion to judge the best time 
to sell. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone anticipates that real estate would be dumped." the 
official said. "But we would prefer the flexibility to sell as market 
conditions dictate and permit. That's the best way to protect the taxpayers' 
interest as well as that of local markets. 
</P>
<P>
"We would rather not see this turn into an all-purpose welfare program. . . . 
We shouldn't use the management program of the FDIC to try to accomplish social 
engineering," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two Texas Republicans -- Sen. Phil Gramm and Rep. Steve Bartlett, both members 
of the banking committees -- agreed that it would be unwise to dictate when or 
how regulators can sell property. 
</P>
<P>
In the last several weeks, FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman has met with Texas 
legislators, including Gramm, to reassure them his agency will not sell at 
below-market prices. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech last week, Seidman said: "If we can't obtain today's fair price, 
we'll hold on." But he warned that holding onto property for too long would 
create an "overhang" on the real estate market and hurt local economies. 
</P>
<P>
On another topic, Seidman outlined a compromise over the so-called logo issue. 
Currently, banks and S&amp;Ls are insured by separate insurance funds: FDIC for 
banks and FSLIC, or Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., for S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
Bush would keep the funds separate but have FDIC administer both. Originally, 
the Administration plan would have had both banks and S&amp;Ls carry the FDIC 
insurance logo. Banks, not wanting to be publicly identified with S&amp;Ls, 
objected. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman said under the compromise "both institutions will display the FDIC 
logo, but as part of that logo, the institution will have to identify whether 
it is part of" the bank fund or the savings and loan fund. 
</P>
<P>
The six groups offering a critique of the Bush plan were the National Taxpayers 
Union Foundation, the Cato Institute, American Enterprise Institute, the 
Competitive Enterprise Institute, the Heritage Foundation and the Brookings 
Institution. 
</P>
<P>
They said Bush's plan to raise $50 billion for S&amp;Ls over three years does 
not provide money fast enough. They said the government should spend $50 
billion by the end of the 1989 fiscal year on Sept. 30 and then assess how much

The groups urged Congress to fight industry attempts to weaken the stricter 
capital standards of the Bush plan and advised it to add the following reforms: 
market-based accounting, risk-based deposit insurance premiums and limits on 
deposit insurance. It said Congress should not attempt to turn back the clock 
by restricting S&amp;Ls mostly to home mortgage lending.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: AME OF BURBANK HALTS TALKS OF PURCHASE WITH THIRD PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AME Inc. said it ended talks with an unidentified third party that had 
expressed interest in possibly buying the Burbank video post-production 
company. 
</P>
<P>
The third party's interest surfaced after AME's founder and chairman, Andrew M. 
McIntyre, offered to buy the 55% of AME he does not already own for $37 
million. But McIntyre scrapped his $13.75-a-share bid last month because he was 
unable to get financing "on satisfactory terms." 
</P>
<P>
AME still might get a buyout proposal, however. Its employee stock ownership 
plan, which already owns 25% of AME, also has said it might be interested in 
offering to buy the company. 
</P>
<P>
AME mainly transfers movies and television shows from film to videotape for 
mass distribution. It also provides computer animation, graphics and audio 
post-production services.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: STANDARD &amp; POOR'S STUDIES LOWERING NEWHALL LAND RATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Newhall Land &amp; Farming Co.'s offer to buy back 10% of its equity units has 
prompted Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. to reconsider its opinion of the Valencia 
company's debt. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Newhall, a real estate and agricultural concern, launched an offer 
to buy back up to 2 million of its units for between $100 million and $112 
million. The offer was part of Newhall's settlement of a lawsuit brought last 
year by dissident unit holders, in which Newhall agreed to buy back at least 
$40 million of its units. 
</P>
<P>
Newhall's units, which are similar to shares of stock, trade on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
After the offer was announced, S&amp;P, a credit-rating service in New York, 
said it placed Newhall's $50 million of convertible subordinated debentures on 
its "CreditWatch" list. That means S&amp;P is thinking about cutting its rating 
of the debt, which is currently BB+ 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;P's ratings, which range from D (for near-default speculative issues) to 
AAA (for top investment-grade debt) help investors determine a borrower's 
credit worthiness. If a company's rating is lowered, investors might force the 
company to pay a higher interest rate to borrow money in the future. 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;P had expected Newhall to repurchase from $40 million to $80 million 
worth of its units. But Newhall said it would actually buy up to $112 million 
worth, using $54 million of available cash and a new bank line of credit. 
</P>
<P>
"This partly debt-financed buyback could shrink cash flow protection 
dramatically," S&amp;P said, referring to Newhall's ability to consistently 
generate enough cash from its business to service all of its bills. 
</P>
<P>
But S&amp;P also said protection "could be restored" if Newhall management 
"takes steps to quickly reduce debt" and if some of the bond holders convert 
their debt into more units. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Wilke, Newhall's chief financial officer, said Newhall expects many of 
the bond holders to convert their holdings into 
</P>
<P>
units to take advantage of its offering. That would substantially cut the 
amount of bonds still outstanding and reduce Newhall's overall long-term debt, 
which now totals about $75 million, he said.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: NETWORKS ELECTRONIC STOCK JUMPS FROM $3.88 TO $6.75 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stock price of Networks Electronic Corp. has soared in the last month from 
$3.88 to $6.75 on Monday. Mihai Patrichi, president of the Chatsworth maker of 
bearings and explosive devices, refused to comment on the increase. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts and company board members said they were unaware of any reason for the 
increase in price. According to the computer trading service of InvestNet in 
Coral Gables, Fla., none of the company's executives or largest shareholders 
have been buying or selling the stock. 
</P>
<P>
For the six months ended Dec. 31, Networks reported a profit of $314,015 
compared to $321,567 in the same period a year earlier. Revenue was up slightly 
to $3.8 million from $3.6 million a year ago.

JACK SMITH: CLUTTER: OUT OF THE CLOSET, INTO THE BEDROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands of readers must feel that Erma Bombeck is looking into their living 
rooms and kitchens. The other day she wrote a column that makes me feel she is 
looking into our bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Erma said that since complaining about an exercise bicycle at the foot of her 
bed, she had received letters from readers who confessed to having not only 
bicycles but fax machines, computers, microwaves and small refrigerators in 
their bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
My computer and fax machine happily are in my work room, but our two bedrooms 
have indeed taken on the corporate look described by Erma. 
</P>
<P>
Because I sometimes have kicking and screaming nightmares, I have taken to 
sleeping in our front bedroom, leaving the larger back bedroom to my wife. But 
as Erma suggested, her room hardly sets a tone for "intimacy, passion and 
adventure." 
</P>
<P>
As I have complained before, my wife's bedroom shelters at least 1,000 
cookbooks, which, in case of an earthquake, would undoubtedly fall over in 
their 6-foot cases and crush any person who happened to be sleeping in the bed 
that formerly was mine. 
</P>
<P>
On either side of the twin electric beds are stacks of old magazines and 
newspapers that she intends to read when she retires. I keep pointing out that 
we can't even keep up with current periodicals, much less years of old ones. 
</P>
<P>
Her bedroom also contains our 26-inch television set, plus a large case 
containing all our videotapes. This collection includes tapes of several Super 
Bowl football games, which, as Erma suggested, are more likely to induce sleep 
than passion in the average housewife. 
</P>
<P>
To the right of the TV stands her sewing machine and all the paraphernalia that 
goes with it. Surely a sewing machine does not give the room a corporate look, 
but it does remind her of work undone. 
</P>
<P>
My bedroom contains not only an exercise bicycle that has not been used since 
my wife bought it for me several years ago, but also a large copying machine 
that sits on an 8-foot folding table acquired years ago for some purpose that 
we can no longer remember. 
</P>
<P>
On top of the table with the copying machine are numerous stacks of books, a 
carton of patterns, various articles of clothing, a manuscript and a cordless 
power scrubber and buffer that has never been removed from its box. 
</P>
<P>
I am also heir to an old desk that my wife bought used and refurbished for use 
in her paper work, which is enormous. Its drawers by now are stuffed with old 
canceled checks, bills and income tax returns, and its top is hopelessly awash 
with pamphlets, magazines, old letters and printed matter of every kind. 
Through sheer glut, it is no longer functional; my wife does her accounts now 
on the dining room table, which has also been rendered useless for its intended 
purpose. 
</P>
<P>
She used to clear off the dining room table on Thursday nights, before the 
housecleaner's regular weekly visit, but she no longer even tries. The table 
has become another in the increasing number of areas that are off-limits to the 
housecleaner. 
</P>
<P>
My workroom is also off limits. The carpet has not been swept for years. My 
desks and table tops are so cluttered with letters, magazines, books, clippings 
and newspaper sections that I would not dare to let the housecleaner past the 
door. 
</P>
<P>
It also contains my computer, two printers and my fax machine. From this cell I 
am able to communicate with almost anyone in the outside world; but if I put a 
letter down it may be lost for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
There are two television sets in the kitchen. One is a color Sony my wife 
bought for me to watch while I was riding the exercise bicycle. Because I never 
rode the bicycle, she put it in the kitchen to watch while she works. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen also has a small black-and-white set that my wife obtained as a 
premium when she invested some money in a savings and loan. So far as I know, 
she has never turned it on. 
</P>
<P>
One of Erma's correspondents said she had a microwave and a small refrigerator 
in her bedroom, so she and her husband could have popcorn, pizza and soft 
drinks while they were watching TV. 
</P>
<P>
We are depraved, but I can say we have not yet sunk that far.

ART BUCHWALD: CAPITAL EXPLANATION OF PHONE MESSAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Art Buchwald 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So many readers ask, "What do people in Washington do all day long?" Believe it 
or not, we are no different from super achievers in other parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the time we make telephone calls, leave messages and then wait for 
someone to return them. We measure our importance by how long it takes for a 
person to get back to us. 
</P>
<P>
Because of this, many Washingtonians have become experts on the smoke screen 
messages the secretaries are sending out to us when we call. 
</P>
<P>
Here's one that is heard frequently: I phone and give my name. There is a pause 
of about 45 seconds, I am put on hold, and then the secretary returns and says, 
"He's not at his desk right now." This makes me wonder, "How far is her desk 
from the boss' desk for the secretary to take 45 seconds to discover he is not 
there?" Once in a while, when I lose my temper, I say, "Well, if he's not at 
his desk, would you look and see if he is hanging outside the window?" 
</P>
<P>
Many of the people I telephone are "in a meeting." Sometimes I want to know 
what kind of meeting. I ask, "Is it a Cabinet meeting, an executive meeting or 
a bowling team meeting?" 
</P>
<P>
"What difference does it make?" 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to speak to him, and the only meeting I won't interrupt is the one 
with the bowling team." 
</P>
<P>
The excuse that always bothers me is, "Mr. Dominick is tied up at the moment." 
An image immediately comes to mind of Dominick tied to a chair with a gag over 
his mouth, listening to an IBM saleswoman trying to persuade him to buy a new 
fax machine. 
</P>
<P>
Another notorious excuse for not talking to me is, "Mr. Califano is out to 
lunch." What's wrong with this message is that my call is at 9:30 in the 
morning. So I ask the secretary to have him get back to me before dinner as I 
have a 2 o'clock dental appointment. 
</P>
<P>
I have a terrible problem about being rejected on the phone. My fears run amok 
when I call someone and he won't talk to me, although I am certain that he's 
there. In my mind I not only see him shaking his head at his secretary, 
indicating "no, no," but I also see his face breaking into a wide grin while he 
is doing it. 
</P>
<P>
As the day goes on I keep imagining a large pile of pink slips on Califano's 
desk, and the one with my name on it is at the bottom. The worst part is that 
if I have to wait more than a few hours for the call to be returned, I usually 
forget what I telephoned about in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
The most painful blow of all is when one's children don't call back. 
</P>
<P>
You leave a message on your daughter's answering machine and days go by, maybe 
weeks, until she telephones. 
</P>
<P>
"Why didn't you get back to me?" I ask. 
</P>
<P>
"I only listened to my messages this morning." 
</P>
<P>
"Suppose it had been important?" 
</P>
<P>
"Why are you calling if it isn't important?" 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, our livelihoods and our self-respect are hooked up to the phone. 
It is an instrument that can either bring much happiness or destroy a fragile 
ego overnight. 
</P>
<P>
The only way to avoid letting the telephone call get you down is to make a game 
of it. I keep score. If someone calls me back within the hour, I give myself 10 
points; four hours, 6 points; eight hours, 3 points. If a person doesn't return 
my call within 24 hours, I deduct 15 points. At the end of the day I add it all 
up. If I have accumulated more points than I have lost, I figure I'm still 
someone in Washington who has to be reckoned with.

A CHALLENGE TO THE POWER OF REASON

<P>
The Pasteurization of France by Bruno Latour, translated from French by Alan 
Sheridan and John Law (Harvard University Press: $30; 273 pages) 
</P>
<P>
Have you heard the one about crossing the Godfather with a deconstructionist? 
The offspring makes you an offer you can't understand. 
</P>
<P>
Cheap joke. 
</P>
<P>
Deconstructionism, you may recall, is the school of radical literary criticism 
which holds that nothing has intrinsic meaning and that texts may be massaged 
to say just about anything the reader wants. 
</P>
<P>
This enterprise, which got its start in literature, has now reverberated 
through many academic disciplines, where its nuggets of truth have proved a 
fruitful, if somewhat dense, way of looking at things. 
</P>
<P>
Today's book, "The Pasteurization of France" by Bruno Latour, brings the 
deconstructionist point of view to the history and sociology of science. 
Latour's first goal here is to debunk the image of Louis Pasteur as the man who 
single-handedly brought the world the germ theory of disease, a solitary hero 
who fought enormous odds to improve public health, the man Paul Muni played in 
the movie. 
</P>
<P>
"A crowd may move a mountain; a single man cannot," Latour writes. "If, 
therefore, we say of a man that he has moved a mountain, it is because he has 
been credited with (or has appropriated) the work of the crowd that he claimed 
to command but that he also followed." 
</P>
<P>
Latour, who is a French sociologist of science, does not stop there. His book 
is not simply a revisionist history. He uses the Pasteur story to make a 
broader argument, namely, that the idea that science is something inherently 
different from politics is a myth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arguing With Science 
</P>
<P>
"There is no essential difference between the human or social sciences and the 
exact or natural sciences, because there is no more science than there is 
society," he says. 
</P>
<P>
And this leads him to a still-broader argument, namely, that there is no 
distinction between reason and power and those who treat the two as separate 
and distinct are making a basic mistake. Science, the epitome of reason, is no 
different from any social enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
"I quickly unearthed what appeared to me to be a fundamental presupposition of 
those who reject 'social' explanations of science," Latour writes. "This is the 
assumption that force is different in kind to reason; right can never be 
reduced to might. . . . I decided to see how knowledge and power would look if 
no distinction were made between force and reason. Would the sky fall on our 
heads? Would we find ourselves unable to do justice to science?" 
</P>
<P>
And this leads Latour to a still-broader argument, presented in the form of 
numbered aphoristic paragraphs, which I cannot begin to summarize except to say 
that he contends that reason itself is a myth. 
</P>
<P>
"The thread of argument is never straight," he says. "Those who talk of 'logic' 
have never looked how something is spun, plaited, ranked, woven, or deduced. A 
butterfly flies in a straighter line than a mind that reasons." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Matter of Taste' 
</P>
<P>
Reason, he writes, "is a matter of taste and feeling, know-how and 
connoisseurship, class and status. We insult, frown, pout, clench our fists, 
enthuse, spit, sigh, and dream. Who reasons?" 
</P>
<P>
To go back: Whether Latour's argument about Pasteur is right or wrong I haven't 
a clue. He says that a variety of powerful social forces were all heading in 
the same direction in late-19th-Century France and that Pasteur simply put 
himself at the head of the column. Hero worship has done the rest, so that now 
every town and village in France has a street named "Pasteur." 
</P>
<P>
Whether right or wrong, Latour's view of Pasteur's contribution is certainly 
iconoclastic, as is each of the succeeding arguments in this seminal though 
difficult book. 
</P>
<P>
Knowledge and power are inseparable. Science is a social activity whose basic 
rules, terms and methods are socially agreed on and have no independent status 
outside of that agreement. We accept the givens so implicitly that we hardly 
ever think of them as givens. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reasons for Questioning 
</P>
<P>
Latour's questioning of the power of reason is particularly strong. We pay lip 
service to reason, but few of us are ever persuaded by it. In general, people 
decide what they believe first and make up the appropriate reasons second. 
There are always plenty of reasons to go around. 
</P>
<P>
The effort to explain necessarily distorts, Latour argues. He shows that 
science itself resists explanation, though there is great reluctance to believe 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"Few people still believe in the advent of the Enlightenment, but nobody has 
yet recovered from this loss of faith," Latour writes. "Not to believe in it is 
to feel that we have been thrown back into the Dark Ages." 
</P>
<P>
And that is where contemporary thought has put us. A loss of faith, with 
nothing to replace it. Nothing to believe in.

The Massachusetts State Arts Council is fighting to stay alive because the Ways 
and Means Committee of the state House of Representatives has spiked a proposed 
budget appropriation of $19.5 million. Unless some or all of the money is 
restored, the agency will cease to exist. Art lovers are comparing the cut to 
"being told that civilization had come to an end." The full House is to take up 
the matter this week. The cut has stirred protests from various national art 
agencies. "My reaction is outrage," Edmund Barry Gaither, director of the 
Museum of the National Center of Afro-American Artists in Roxbury, told the New 
York Times. "Minority institutions will be disproportionately impacted because 
they don't have endowments and a donor-base reaching back to the 19th Century 
as do many other cultural organizations." Most top political leaders are 
unwilling to predict the outcome of the fight, but Gov. Michael S. Dukakis has 
expressed strong support for the Arts Council, for which he wrote the original 
legislation in 1966. The cutback resulted from unrelated forces, including an 
unexpected $600-million state budget deficit.

Ted Turner's Turner Entertainment Networks has bought future cable rights to 
show CBS' hit miniseries, "Lonesome Dove," both on Turner's Atlanta 
superstation, TBS, and his new TNT channel. The purchase price wasn't 
disclosed, but speculation put it around $2 million. CBS, which aired the 
eight-part Old West show last month, has rights for a second broadcast. A 
Turner spokeswoman said "Dove" probably won't air on Turner's cable empire 
until 1991. The miniseries, which starred Robert Duvall, averaged a 26.1 
rating, the highest for a miniseries in five years. Each ratings point 
represents 904,000 homes. ALEENE MacMINN

Musically and academically gifted students who've had to choose between a 
liberal arts and a conservatory education will now be able to study in both 
worlds through a new joint degree program announced by Juilliard School, 
Columbia University and Barnard College. The three schools have set up a 
cross-registration program that will open individual courses at Juilliard to 
qualified students in the other undergraduate schools, and vice versa. The plan 
will allow students to earn two degrees -- a bachelor of arts in any major and 
a master's degree in music -- in five years rather than six. ALEENE MacMINN

GOING OVER THE TOP WITH THE TOLL AT BOGART'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DUNCAN STRAUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the Midwest, a show by the Toll is a fire marshal's nightmare. People there 
speak of the group in reverential terms, and there's a palpable buzz 
surrounding its debut release, "The Price of Progression." 
</P>
<P>
What a difference a few states make. The Ohio quartet's local debut at Bogart's 
on Sunday drew maybe 50 people. The Toll hasn't raised its profile by releasing 
a 10-minute song as its first single, "Jonathan Toledo." Actually, that epic is 
a representative calling card not only because two other songs on the album 
clock in at more than 10 minutes, but also because these humorless lads are 
often way over the top -- for better and worse. 
</P>
<P>
Over huge, guitar-driven anthemic passages, singer Brad Circone improvises 
different narratives and lyrics, ranging from the effects of a Catholic 
upbringing to the mind-set of a middle-aged woman trapped in an unfulfilling 
marriage. On Sunday, his pumped-up stage antics included a full flip and a 
sudden fall onto the dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
The Toll (which plays the Coach House tonight and Club Lingerie on Thursday) 
won't be everyone's cup of sonic tea. But with the showy theatrics, the nightly 
tightrope act of verbal improvisations and a big sound, this is clearly an 
arena-rock band waiting to happen. With enough touring -- and some shorter 
singles -- it probably will. DUNCAN STRAUSS

PYLON SPELLS RELIEF TO POST-MODERNISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They used to call it post-punk. Now they call it post-modern. Call it post 
office for all that matters. It's a sound both minimal and danceable, often 
with surfy, scratchy guitar lines, funkified dance rhythms and personalized 
vocal approaches. 
</P>
<P>
These cerebral garage bands, like Britain's Gang of Four and New York's Bush 
Tetras, seem to have had their day -- but save the last dance for Pylon. The 
Athens, Ga., band, which re-formed last year after a few years off, played Club 
Lingerie on Sunday, bringing the clean, clear sound of relief to ears clouded 
with today's overblown murk and thud. 
</P>
<P>
Singer Vanessa Hay's guttural screams, soothing coos and Road Runner sound 
effects bring back the genuinely human, uncalculated eccentricity missing in 
today's pop women -- the wan folk singers, the blow-dried rock vixens, the 
aerobicized, lobotomized disco dollies. This larger-than-life Southern belle is 
as original as the band's musical geometry. 
</P>
<P>
With its steely guitars traveling at oblique angles through scenarios like 
"Crazy" and "M-Train," Pylon proved itself not another retro-art college cult 
group, but simply an unpretentious combo hooked into a primal thrill-ride pulse 
that makes this one of America's great past, present and future rock bands. 
Let's not lose them again. CRAIG LEE

RIDGE STRING QUARTET AT CALTECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY McQUILKIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What is the secret of music- making so engaging, so exquisite, so delicious as 
that offered by the Ridge String Quartet Sunday at Caltech? 
</P>
<P>
It certainly goes beyond mere accuracy of execution, though in matters of 
intonation, tone quality, balance and technical precision, one could find 
little to complain about. It has more to do with the distinctiveness of the 
performances -- the personality of the music. 
</P>
<P>
The quartet's reading of Schumann's Quartet in A, Opus 41, No. 3 is a case in 
point. While the four players capitalized fully on the work's many contrasts, 
showing a remarkably wide dynamic spectrum, they proved especially alert to the 
subtleties of the score. They shaped phrases with eloquence, bent tempos at 
just the threshold of perceptibility and brought delightful piquancy to the 
little dissonances that figure throughout the work. 
</P>
<P>
The only blemish in the performance was the players' tendency to inhale audibly 
at dramatic moments. 
</P>
<P>
There have been some personnel changes since Southland listeners first heard 
the ensemble, as the winner of the 1982 Coleman Competition, but Bartok's 
quartets have remained a constant in the group's repertory. And the work that 
garnered it the top prize -- the Second Quartet -- was what violinists Krista 
Bennion Feeney and Robert Rinehart (the founding members), violist Maria 
Lambros and cellist Peter Wyrick offered at Beckman Auditorium Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Striking a balance between the dramatic intensity and the heady complexity of 
the work, the foursome gave a reading both intellectually probing and 
emotionally stirring. 
</P>
<P>
Their reading of Haydn's Quartet in F minor ("Razor") also proved a fine 
combination of elegance and ebullience. Under Feeney's strong leadership, the 
quartet played with vigor -- but never raucousness -- and allowed Haydn's 
delightful wit to come to the fore. TERRY McQUILKIN

'ANYTHING BUT LOVE' HAS WIT, BRAINS, GOOD TIME SLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
She's rosy, he's gloomy. To her the glass is half full, to him there's no 
glass. She's an aspiring writer, he's already a prominent staffer on a Chicago 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Do they fall for each other? Does Chicago have the Cubs? 
</P>
<P>
"Anything but Love" is hardly unpredictable. Yet the premiere of this urbane 
ABC comedy (at 9:30 tonight on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42) is witty and pleasing 
enough to be interesting. The main characters are intelligent and amusing. 
Jamie Lee Curtis performs with confidence as Hannah Miller in her return to 
series TV after more than a decade ("Operation Petticoat"). And comedian 
Richard Lewis -- following fellow stand-up comic Roseanne Barr in the ABC 
lineup -- is very funny in spots as neurotic Marty Gold. 
</P>
<P>
Hannah and Marty, a terrified flier, meet on a jet. She calms him down. In 
return, he tells her about an opening for a researcher at his magazine. She 
applies, showing her spunk and talent by overcoming a difficult obstacle placed 
in her path by the magazine's tyrannical editor. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, your mind replays a memorable sequence from the premiere of the 
late, great "Mary Tyler Moore Show," in which Mary interviews for an assistant 
producer's job with WJM-TV news director Lou Grant. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got spunk!" Lou says. As Mary begins to bask in the complement, Lou 
quickly adds: "I hate spunk!" 
</P>
<P>
Well, that was genius. Hannah's new boss, however, likes spunk. Does she get 
the job? Do the Cubs always fade in the stretch? 
</P>
<P>
What "Anything but Love" lacks in initial boldness, it occasionally makes up 
for in sharp writing, as in Marty dropping in on Hannah -- who lives in an 
isolated cabin with her father -- and being surprised outside the place by the 
father carrying a hatchet. 
</P>
<P>
Marty: "I'm looking for the Miller family . . . but whatever you've done to 
them will be our little secret." 
</P>
<P>
Following the hit "Roseanne," it's unlikely that "Anything but Love" will be 
anyone's little secret for long. HOWARD ROSENBERG

ATTORNEY SAYS IMPLICATING LEWIS UNFAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carl Lewis said he knew Ben Johnson was taking performance-enhancing drugs just 
after their 100-meter final last fall at the Seoul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"He got out of those blocks like a caged lion," Lewis said in an interview 
Sunday at the Los Angeles Marathon, where he was representing a sponsor. "How 
can anybody in the world do that after running all those rounds (preliminary 
heats)? 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Look, I don't know what he is taking or what he is doing, but he is 
doing something.' " 
</P>
<P>
Now Lewis has been implicated in an alleged sabotage of Johnson's drug test, 
which returned a positive result for the banned anabolic steroid stanozolol. 
</P>
<P>
At a Canadian inquiry into drug use in sport Monday at Toronto, Charlie 
Francis, a Canadian sprint coach, testified that Johnson might have drunk 
contaminated beer before a urinalysis. Francis based his theory on the fact 
that Johnson took the steroid furazabol three weeks before the Games, not the 
difficult-to-detect stanozolol. 
</P>
<P>
According to Francis' testimony, Johnson said that an unidentified man who had 
been talking with Lewis sat near the beer that was provided for the athletes to 
facilitate them in providing urine samples. 
</P>
<P>
Francis said that two witnesses told him that the stranger had spoken with 
Lewis in another area of the waiting room. Lewis had finished second to 
Johnson, who set a world record of 9.79 seconds in winning the 100-meter gold 
medal, and subsequently also had to be tested. 
</P>
<P>
"Any allocation or innuendo that Carl Lewis tampered with Ben Johnson's drink 
or sample is ludicrous," said David Greifinger, Lewis' attorney. "These sound 
like the last acts of desperate men who know they've committed wrong and see no 
other way out other than to continue to lie and to fabricate stories. 
</P>
<P>
"Charlie and Ben should own up to the fact that what they did was wrong, and 
should promise to never to do it again and move on with their lives. By 
continuing their present course of action they are just embarrassing themselves 
further." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Though Johnson's gold medal and Seoul world-record time were both revoked, his 
world mark of 9.83 seconds stands. He set the record at the 1987 World 
Championships at Rome, where Lewis finished second in 9.93 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said Sunday that officials of the International Amateur Athletics 
Federation should disallow Johnson's world record from Rome because Francis has 
testified his sprinter took drugs before the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
If that were to happen, Lewis would replace Johnson as the world record-holder. 
IAAF officials, however, said the record will stand because Johnson passed a 
drug test after the 1987 race. 
</P>
<P>
"If it has been proven that he took drugs, I would think that (withdrawing the 
record) is the responsible thing for the sport," Lewis said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis also contended that Francis' testimony painted a false picture as to why 
Johnson would take performance-enhancing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
According to testimony, since 1981 Johnson has taken such drugs as furazabol, 
stanozolol and the human growth hormone, which is taken from the pituitary 
glands of human cadavers or can be taken in synthetic form. The drugs induce 
the growth of muscle tissue, and some athletes claim, help performances. 
</P>
<P>
"He is trying to say that everyone was on it, so they got on it," Lewis said. 
"That's not true. They wanted to beat people. That's why they got on drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said track and field is not infested with steroid users as some are 
beginning to believe in light of the Canadian inquiry. He said about 90% of the 
athletes are drug-free. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of your great athletes are clean," Lewis said. "There are athletes who do 
have a problem. I can tell who's on it. I've been around it too long." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, however, refused to implicate any of his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
But Lewis defended Evelyn Ashford, a world-class sprinter who was implicated as 
a steroid user in Francis' testimony last week. Lewis and Ashford are teammates 
on the Santa Monica Track Club. 
</P>
<P>
"No way in the world does she take drugs," Lewis said, pounding a table. "She 
is a victim. That's going to happen. I don't think that will hurt her image 
because Evelyn is clean and she always stood for being clean. People who know 
her know it." 
</P>
<P>
In finishing second at the Olympics, Lewis set a U.S. record of 9.92 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Even before Lewis replaced Johnson as the gold-medal winner two days after the 
race, the U.S. Olympian said he was happy with his result. 
</P>
<P>
"I've come to grips with the fact that I'm the best I can be and I can't ask 
for anything more," he said. "I'm doing what is right. I have to feel there is 
some merit to that. It didn't ease the pain of not winning and feeling he 
(Johnson) was on drugs. But it made me feel like I'm putting something back 
into track and field because I'm setting an example." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis called for Johnson to also become a role model. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Ben is 110% irresponsible in not coming out and telling kids to stay 
off drugs," he said. "He needs to stand up and say, 'Don't do it. Look what 
happened to me whether I knew it or not, make sure you know. Don't take it 
unless you know what it is.' 
</P>
<P>
"But he is perpetuating continued drug use. I think he's just lying to himself. 
The biggest thing about drug use is denial. Somebody takes cocaine because they 
want to get high. Some people take steroids because they want to run faster. 
It's the same thing. You're trying to cheat somehow." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, who won four gold medals at the 1984 Summer Games and has been one of 
the great sprinters and long jumpers in track and field, said he is determined 
to help the sport's image. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what people don't realize," he said. "I could leave it all alone but 
the thing is, I want track to be a better sport than when I came. If anybody 
gets what they deserve in track and field, it's me. I make the most money, I 
get the appearances. But I still believe that through it all I want to help 
every single person whether they make $50 a meet or near what I make." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said his deep-rooted conviction comes from his parents, who raised him to 
stand by his beliefs. Lewis said their philosophy was inspired by the late Dr. 
Martin Luther King, who once said it is important to make such sacrifices. 
</P>
<P>
"That people cannot sacrifice for something in their life, whether it is a 
small insignificant thing to others or a big thing to the world, what's the use 
of living?" Lewis asked. "I feel if I can't sacrifice myself for the betterment 
of other people in track and field, well, then I cannot leave a legacy that 
will be remembered."

JIM MURRAY: QUIET MAN HAD PLENTY TO SHOUT ABOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He was quiet, modest, unassuming, quite unlike almost any football coach you 
ever saw. He never raised his voice, threw his weight around. All he did was 
win. 
</P>
<P>
People who came around the team camp for the first time thought he was the 
trainer. Or, at best, an assistant in charge of the kicking teams. 
</P>
<P>
He won two Super Bowls, four division championships and two conference 
championships. He never had a nickname such as Hoss or Bull or Grizzly. No one 
ever called him Genius. In fact, few called him Coach. He was just Tom. And he 
left the job rather unceremoniously after only the second losing season of his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Landry? 
</P>
<P>
No, Tom Flores. 
</P>
<P>
I don't think there's any doubt Tom Flores was the most underrated football 
coach of all time. 
</P>
<P>
You see, the problem with being the coach of the Raiders is Al Davis. If it is 
true an institution is but the lengthened shadow of one man, then the Raiders 
are the lengthened shadow of Al Davis. 
</P>
<P>
But someone has to translate those X's and O's off the drawing boards and into 
the end zone. No Raider coach did this any better than Tom Flores. 
</P>
<P>
If the public perception of him was that of a complicated foreman, that was all 
right with Tom. He had less trouble with his ego than any coach you will ever 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
His was the only wild-card team that ever won a Super Bowl. When he went to New 
Orleans in 1981, the Raiders were widely held to be just a bunch of league 
renegades, thugs who played the game the way their eye-patched pirate logo 
suggested, outside the law. 
</P>
<P>
Flores was so low-key, it was hard to believe he was the leader of this 
cutthroat crew. It was freely predicted that he would be outsmarted by the 
cerebral boy wonder of the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl XV, Coach Dick 
Vermeil. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't even a contest. Flores' Raiders played a mistake-free, impeccable 
game and thrashed the Eagles thoroughly and professionally. 
</P>
<P>
Success didn't spoil Tom Flores. The victory went to the team's head -- the 
Raiders were 7-9 the next season -- not his. 
</P>
<P>
Two seasons later, he was back in the Super Bowl again, this time against the 
canny Joe Gibbs, supposedly the next Lombardi. Once again, Flores was, if 
anything, undermatched. The Raiders won in the worst wipeout to that date in 
Super Bowl history, 38-9. It was, incidentally, the last Super Bowl won by the 
AFC. 
</P>
<P>
If there was one thing a Tom Flores team wasn't, it was over-coached. The 
Raiders were a quick-striking, take-no-prisoners force, and their philosophy 
was to get the other team into a looking-over-both-shoulders-at-once mode with 
a My-God-they're-coming-in-the-windows! frame of mind. 
</P>
<P>
To do this, you need a quarterback and the Raiders were fresh out in 1978 when 
Flores, then an assistant coach, was sent to check out a supposedly burned-out 
San Francisco reject, Jim Plunkett. 
</P>
<P>
Plunkett was universally believed to have lost his confidence and maybe 
throwing ability at the time but Flores, a one-time quarterback himself, 
couldn't believe what he found. Not only was Plunkett's all-league arm intact, 
so were his competitive instincts. Flores urged that he be signed. 
</P>
<P>
"Just keep the pass rush off him and he'll hit a gnat in the eye," Flores 
promised. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders signed Plunkett as a free agent, the biggest bargain since Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
When Flores became head coach a year later, he handed the ball to Plunkett and 
some of the Raiders' finest hours began. The team went 9-7, 11-5, 7-9, 8-1, 
12-4, 11-5, 12-4 and then 8-8 and 5-10. They got in two Super Bowls, missed 
another by three points and made the playoffs five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Flores left the Raiders after the '87 season. He insists it was his own 
idea, but there is no evidence management put up much of a fight. 
</P>
<P>
"I was physically exhausted," Flores says. "It was not burnout as such, but it 
got so I hated to go to work. I had told Al (Davis) the year before that I was 
looking at only a 10-year commitment and this was nine years. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew the team needed rebuilding and I wasn't sure I had the energy to go 
through it. Usually, you end a season physically and emotionally exhausted, but 
you recharge during the off-season. I didn't recharge.

"What's wrong with the Raiders? Well, I actually feel the strike in '87 sort of 
took the personality out of the team. I know it drained me. You had the vets 
outside picketing and you had the heart of your team -- or maybe the soul -- 
torn apart. I don't think any of us, coaches or players, got back on the same 
page after that." 
</P>
<P>
Flores made the news again last week by announcing that he is coming back into 
football. He is to be the president and general manager of the Seattle 
Seahawks, a franchise purchased by a longtime friend from his days in the Bay 
Area. 
</P>
<P>
Tom also is going to be honored Friday night at the Sheraton Grand hotel by the 
Salesian Boys (and Girls) Club of East Los Angeles. This is another franchise 
in need of rebuilding. The earthquake of '87 damaged the gymnasium and swimming 
pool, and this 1,500-youth facility that seeks to provide an alternative to 
street gangs is in dire need of funds. 
</P>
<P>
Flores will gets the Merit of Excellence Award -- along with Jaime Escalante, 
the famed schoolteacher of the film "Stand and Deliver." 
</P>
<P>
The word macho needs re-defining. It doesn't mean a guy on horseback with a 
fierce mustache and banderillas and a mocking laugh. It can mean a quiet, 
patient, somber guy who just beats your brains out without getting particularly 
excited about it, who will help you up when he's through. 
</P>
<P>
It can mean Tom Flores.

Loyola Marymount left its start in San Francisco, but the Lions still won their 
second straight West Coast Athletic Conference tournament Monday night, beating 
Santa Clara, 75-70, in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second straight season Loyola has knocked off the Broncos in the 
final to earn an automatic berth in the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola, which averages 114 points and has several times scored more than 75 
points in a half, won this one the hard way, getting its lowest scoring total 
of the season despite the overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Junior guard Jeff Fryer, scoreless in regulation after halftime, scored the 
Lions' first eight points in the overtime to lead the way. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Gathers tied the game, 65-65, with 25 seconds left in regulation, and both 
teams missed chances to avoid the overtime. 
</P>
<P>
When Fryer and Bo Kimble missed free throws in the final minute of overtime, 
Loyola got the rebound each time to protect the lead. Enoch Simmons hit two 
free throws with 11 seconds left to clinch it. 
</P>
<P>
After Fryer and Jeffty Connelly traded baskets to open the overtime, Connelly, 
who finished with 23 points, made a steal and took off for a breakaway. 
Loyola's Per Stumer made a controversial block from behind -- Santa Clara 
wanted a goaltending call -- and Fryer made a three-pointer to give the Lions 
the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions improved to 20-10 despite shooting only 33% in a game played more in 
Santa Clara's physical style. The Broncos didn't shoot much better at 43%. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a pretty dance for us, but we can win in that style, we just don't 
like to," Loyola Coach Paul Westhead said. "I think you saw the results of 
playing three games in three nights. It's very demanding. The guys were at the 
point of exhaustion." 
</P>
<P>
Gathers, who had 30 points and 16 rebounds, was named the tournament's most 
valuable player. Kimble, who scored 16 points, was also named to the 
all-tournament team, along with Santa Clara forward Jens Gordon, who had 18 
points and a career-high 17 rebounds, Connelly, and Bronco freshman guard 
Melvin Chinn. 
</P>
<P>
Fryer, who finished with 19 points, was conspicuously missing from the postgame 
honors. "I'd like to nominate Jeff Fryer for a new category, all-overtime 
team," Westhead quipped. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola, which made only 24 of 72 shots and only four three-pointers, resorted 
to its scrambling press to get back in the game after surrendering a 12-point 
lead and falling behind by as many as six early in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"Both teams were pretty tired and missed a lot of shots," Santa Clara Coach 
Carroll Williams said. "Our kids did a pretty good job of making them play some 
defense. It's like going through a mine field, going through that press." 
</P>
<P>
Loyola forced 26 turnovers. Santa Clara (20-10), which has appeared in all 
three WCAC tournament finals, hopes to participate in the National Invitation 
Tournament for the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola trailed, 38-37, at halftime and remained cold early in the second half 
when Santa Clara forged a 44-38 lead paced by two drives by Mitch Burley. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola, then made its move, scoring 12 consecutive points for a 50-44 lead. In 
the run, Gathers scored eight points and Loyola's press forced two consecutive 
turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara tied the score, 63-63, with 2 minutes to play.

FLOJO ADDS SULLIVAN TO HER CACHE;

GRIFFITH JOYNER GETS AWARD TO GO WITH 3 OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALS

Florence Griffith Joyner, named the Sullivan Award winner for 1988 as the 
nation's top amateur athlete, says she's finding retirement difficult to 
accept. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I would miss it this much," said FloJo, who announced her 
retirement last month. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I looked forward to the days when I wouldn't have to get up and run 
around and lift weights, but I really miss it," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith Joyner won three gold medals and a silver at the 1988 Olympics at 
Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
Supported by her husband, Al Joyner, and wiping away tears, she said: "It took 
me 20 years to get a world record and a gold medal. If I had to do it all over, 
I wouldn't change a thing." 
</P>
<P>
She thanked her husband, who served as her coach in the final months of her 
career. 
</P>
<P>
"He's done so much," she said. "Getting up in the morning for workouts and 
sometimes at midnight. He gave up a lot of his career." 
</P>
<P>
Joyner, 1984 Olympic gold medalist in the long jump, is now being coached by 
his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"I've asked myself, 'Was I this hard on her?' " he said. "She shows no pity for 
me. She really makes me work." 
</P>
<P>
The stop in Indianapolis is just another mark on a hectic international travel 
schedule the 29-year-old from Los Angeles has maintained since setting two 
world records in the 100 and 200 meters at the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"In recent months I've been to Germany, Harvard, New York, back to Los Angeles, 
San Francisco, Houston and back to San Francisco. I'll be home a couple of days 
and then I'll be on the road again," she said. "In May, I'll be heading to 
Japan for two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Griffith Joyner joins her sister-in-law, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, on the list of 
Sullivan winners. Joyner-Kersee was the 1986 winner. 
</P>
<P>
"What has happened is way beyond anything I ever dreamed," Griffith Joyner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Nine other Olympians also were finalists -- swimmers Matt Biondi and Janet 
Evans, figure skater Brian Boitano, kayaker Greg Barton, speedskater Bonnie 
Blair, volleyball player Karch Kiraly, boxer Roy Jones, basketball player 
Katrina McClain and wrestler John Smith.

The University of Oklahoma is still reviewing an incident that led to the 
arrest of basketball star Mookie Blaylock, and won't make any decisions before 
the investigation is completed, team spokesman Mike Prusinski said. 
</P>
<P>
Athletic Director Donnie Duncan had said a decision might be made Monday about 
Blaylock, who was arrested Sunday on a complaint of public intoxication. 
</P>
<P>
But Prusinski said Coach Billy Tubbs was on a recruiting visit to Chicago and 
school offices were closed because of a weekend snowstorm. Prusinski said he 
did not expect a decision until later in the week.

Sports agents Lloyd Bloom and Norby Walters used money and threats to force 
college athletes around the country to sign contracts with them, U.S. Attorney 
Anton Valukas claimed as the agents' federal trial began in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
But defense attorneys, who portrayed the agents as victims of money-hungry 
athletes and the colleges as operating more like big business than institutes 
of higher learning, contend the agents used common tactics. 
</P>
<P>
Bloom, 29, and Walters, 58, both based in New York, have pleaded not guilty to 
charges of racketeering, mail fraud, wire fraud and extortion in what 
authorities contend was a scheme to defraud colleges and universities by 
signing athletes to professional contracts before their college eligibility had 
expired. 
</P>
<P>
"You are not going to hear any evidence that these so-called victims (the 
schools) had to forfeit a dollar," Robert Gold, Walters' attorney, told the 
jury in his opening statement. "You won't hear it because it never happened." 
</P>
<P>
Bloom's attorney, Dan Webb, said National Collegiate Athletic Assn. eligibility 
rules -- not federal laws -- were broken and that it was the athletes, not the 
agents, who broke them. 
</P>
<P>
Walters and Bloom tried to keep the athletes under their wing with threats, 
Valukas said in his opening statement. 
</P>
<P>
The agents threatened athletes by saying, " 'We're going to expose you . . . we 
will hold you and your parents up to ridicule,' " Valukas said. 
</P>
<P>
"They told the athletes they would have their associates from organized crime . 
. . break their legs if they did not live up to their contracts." 
</P>
<P>
Webb argued that the athletes were not intimidated by Bloom's threat to break 
their legs, knowing Bloom was "hotheaded" and was angry when some tried to back 
out of their contracts and hire new agents. 
</P>
<P>
"They (players) clearly provoked the conduct," Webb said. "They clearly were 
aware that Lloyd Bloom appeared to be someone with a big mouth."

Arizona became only the third team this season to hold the No. 1 spot for two 
consecutive weeks in the Associated Press college basketball poll. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats, who defeated UCLA, 89-86, Saturday, were an overwhelming choice 
as the top team after a week in which four of the top six teams -- Georgetown, 
Indiana, North Carolina and Syracuse -- were beaten. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats (24-3) received 61 first-place votes of the 66 cast by the 
nationwide panel of sportswriters and broadcasters and 1,315 points for their 
third week atop the rankings and second in a row.

SHAHANGA RESURFACES A DAY LATER

Gidamis Shahanga, who led Sunday's Los Angeles Marathon for 26 miles, then 
dropped out of sight, surfaced Monday at a press conference, saying the heat 
had forced him to slow his pace. He finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Shahanga wasn't the only casualty claimed by Sunday's high temperatures, but 
his was the most dramatic fade. Shahanga, from Tanzania, said he was in control 
until the 20-mile mark. 
</P>
<P>
"I missed the water stations at 23 and 24 miles," he said. "I think that 
affected my performance. I felt so very tired that I had to walk. If I had 
gotten water, I don't think we would be talking like this." 
</P>
<P>
Shahanga said he missed getting water at 23 miles and didn't see the water 
station at 24. 
</P>
<P>
Art Boileau, who won in 2 hours 13 minutes 1 second, said he felt fine. He was 
not as affected by the heat as Shahanga, who set a fast early pace. The women's 
winner, Zoya Ivanova of the Soviet Union, whose time was 2:34:42, also said she 
had no lingering effects from the heat. 
</P>
<P>
Ivanova answered Sunday's burning question: Would Soviet officials allow her to 
keep the luxury car she had won? Yes. Her order of a burgundy sedan would be 
shipped to her home in the southeastern Soviet Union, where, she said, not even 
the mayor had such a car. 
</P>
<P>
Marathon President Bill Burke said he was pleased with the fourth annual race, 
which drew 18,861 entrants. 
</P>
<P>
"We need more time," he said. "Now we have the money, we have the recognition, 
we have the athletes. We just need more time to mature." 
</P>
<P>
Channel 13's marathon coverage averaged an 11.8 Nielsen rating and a 34 share, 
the best sports rating of the day in Los Angeles. The Lakers on Channel 2 drew 
a 7.4 rating and a 22 share, the Dodgers on Channel 11 a 5.9 and a 16. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's L.A. Marathon on Channel 13 averaged a 12.5 rating and a 34 share.

CONCEPCION IS TRYING TO PROVE REDS WRONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<P>
For years, he was an immaculate Concepcion, the All-Star shortstop whose steady 
glove and heady play anchored more than a generation of Cincinnati Reds 
infields. He was there to break in with Tommy Helms and Lee May, and he was 
there to break in Ron Oester and Nick Esasky. 
</P>
<P>
But the year is 1989. Davey Concepcion is 40. He is no longer an All-Star, or a 
starter, or even a Cincinnati Red. 
</P>
<P>
This year, in his 20th major league training camp, Concepcion can be found, 
heavy of thigh and short of range, trudging through drills in the unfamiliar 
navy and red of the Angels. He is here as a non-roster invitee, signed to a 
triple-A contract. 
</P>
<P>
He is trying to catch on as a utility infielder. 
</P>
<P>
The scene alternately saddens and intrigues, depending upon the perspective of 
the observer. 
</P>
<P>
From Plant City, Fla., where the Reds train, Manager Pete Rose shakes his head 
and wonders why his longtime teammate is willing to risk permanent damage to 
his reputation -- and, for Pete's sake, his Hall of Fame credentials -- by 
trying to wring out one final, unnecessary season. 
</P>
<P>
But from the Angels' camp in Mesa, where the talent pool of utility players 
runs shallow, Manager Doug Rader considers the Concepcion experiment not only 
necessary, but essential. 
</P>
<P>
With the Reds, Concepcion was too old and too slow and hit only .198 with eight 
runs batted in for nearly 200 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
"If we thought he could still play, he'd still be with us," Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
With the Angels, Concepcion is the cagey veteran brought in to lend guidance 
and 19 seasons' worth of experience to a young infield. 
</P>
<P>
According to Rader, the utility job is Concepcion's to lose. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't underestimate the kinds of things Davey Concepcion can bring to a 
team," Rader said. "If he shows he can play shortstop, he's the guy." 
</P>
<P>
Interesting how these things come full circle. Shortstop was the position 
Concepcion made famous in Cincinnati from 1970 through 1986, where he won five 
Gold Gloves and qualified for nine All-Star games. If he shows he can play 
shortstop? For a decade and a half, Concepcion showed the way for all National 
League shortstops. 
</P>
<P>
But that was before he broke his hand in 1986 and hurt his shoulder in 1988. 
That was before age wrapped a ball-and-chain around his legs. That was before 
Barry Larkin came and bumped him over to second base, and then to first base, 
and then, eventually, to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop finally became Concepcion's ticket out of town. 
</P>
<P>
"His movement just wasn't there anymore," Rose said. "Frankly, our people 
thought he could only play first base." 
</P>
<P>
And, now, Concepcion has to prove all over -- to a new manager, a new team and 
a new league -- that, yes, he can play shortstop, at least occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
Concepcion believes an old dog can brush up on old tricks. 
</P>
<P>
"Doug Rader wants me to back up at shortstop," Concepcion said. "He knows it's 
not the same Concepcion of 10, 12 years ago, when I played against him. I don't 
have the quickness of a Dick Schofield or a Barry Larkin. You can't ask a body 
at age 40 to do what it did at 20 and 21. 
</P>
<P>
"But so far, this spring, my body is going good. . . . I think I can play 
(shortstop) a game here, a game there. I can still move around." 
</P>
<P>
Concepcion says he is driven by a new fire -- the desire to show the Reds, and 
Rose in particular, that they were wrong when they released him last October. 
</P>
<P>
Concepcion spent 19 seasons with Cincinnati, tying him with Rose for most years 
of service by a Reds player, but remains embittered over the club's decision to 
cut him before his 20th season. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't give me the opportunity to play 20 years," he said. "That's all I 
was asking. Everybody else got opportunities to keep playing in Cincinnati. 
They brought back Tony Perez. Pete Rose played three more years as 
player-manager. But they don't want me to be there." 
</P>
<P>
For this, Concepcion puts much of the blame on Rose. 
</P>
<P>
"As a manager, Pete Rose got against me," Concepcion said. "Since he's gotten 
to be manager, he's changed. Day by day, he was taking my job away from me. 
</P>
<P>
"Finally, he did it. Finally, he got me out of there. I don't know why. It's 
just the way he is. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were friends, but I don't think he knows what a friend is. He 
doesn't have a friend. We got along for one reason -- winning -- I guess." 
</P>
<P>
Rose, as one might imagine, has a response. 
</P>
<P>
"We got along fine until we decided not to re-sign him," Rose said. "Now he 
feels I'm the sole determining factor of that. 
</P>
<P>
"You know as well as I do, there's always a lot of bitterness when you release 
a guy or trade a guy or send a guy down. They take it so personal, but it's 
usually an organizational decision. 
</P>
<P>
"In Davey's case, we didn't think he could help us anymore. If he had showed us 
anything . . . 
</P>
<P>
"But he batted less than .200 and had less than a dozen RBIs in 200 times 
at-bat (actually 197). That tells me something's missing." 
</P>
<P>
Rose, statistics-conscious as always, even in retirement, is perplexed by 
Concepcion's desire to keep playing after last season's washout. 
</P>
<P>
"I got the feeling that Davey sort of wanted to play just to get the 20 years," 
Rose said, disbelief in his voice. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him, 'Davey, you don't want to play just to get 20. If you go through 
another year like the last one, you're going to hurt your Hall of Fame chances. 
Throw two sub-.200 seasons at the voters and that's going to really hurt you. 
You had a Hall of Fame career, why do you want to hang around and be a utility 
player for?' " 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Rose didn't exactly go quietly, either. 
</P>
<P>
"None of wants to go out when we're hitting .320, I guess," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And in 1987, Concepcion was right there. In his first full season as the Reds' 
utility infielder, he batted .319, including .333 as a pinch-hitter, and filled 
in at every infield position. 
</P>
<P>
"Two years ago, he was the best utility player in baseball," Rose said. "He 
played all four infield positions flawlessly, he hit .319. 
</P>
<P>
"But last year, he didn't dominate (left-handed pitching) like he'd done in the 
past. Usually, Davey would go two for four against a left-hander. But hitting 
.198, he didn't dominate anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Concepcion contends that he can still hit, pointing to the .290 average he had 
while playing in Venezuela last winter. The .198 average last summer, he says, 
was caused largely by a bum shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan winter leagues turned out to be Concepcion's Angel connection. 
Angel official Preston Gomez scouted a couple of Concepcion's games there and 
laid the groundwork for the veteran's tryout this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez also offered a suggestion. By the opening of training camp, he said, he 
wanted to see less of Concepcion. Maybe 15 pounds less. Through injury, 
inactivity and basic indifference, Concepcion ballooned into a Big Ex-Red 
Machine. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Gomez said, Concepcion "has lost about 10 or 12 pounds. He needs to 
go a little bit more." 
</P>
<P>
Concepcion, however, insists that he was never all that fat, that his weight 
has hovered around 200 for years and that Gomez has gone a little overboard 
with this overweight business. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, Preston wants me to lose weight," Concepcion said, laughing. "He 
remembers when I was 180. I was 180 a long time ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The last few years, I've been 200 and maybe last year, I was 203 or 204. I was 
never more than three or four pounds over that." 
</P>
<P>
Rose enters the debate. 
</P>
<P>
"The scales will tell you he didn't (gain weight)," Rose said. "Compared to how 
he was three years ago, he weighed about the same. But, it's distributed 
differently now. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't run as good last year and had to strictly rely on his experience to 
get by. . . . We felt he lost a lot of movement. I hope he gets it back." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, back in Plant City, Rose extends an olive branch Concepcion's way. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no bitterness here," Rose said. "Davey meant a lot to Cincinnati 
baseball. He was our captain. I don't think anybody in our clubhouse would say 
anything negative about Davey Concepcion. 
</P>
<P>
"But, in truth, he wasn't helping us anymore. Sometimes star players, including 
myself, don't want to hear that. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope he does well for California. The last thing I want him to do is flop or 
get cut over there." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, that's something both Rose and Concepcion can agree on. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
On and off the field, the Angels took care of business Monday. First off, Vice 
President Mike Port ended the club's longstanding stalemate with Devon White by 
signing the center fielder to a one-year contract, believed to be worth about 
$325,000, plus incentives. Then, Doug Rader and Co. went out and defeated the 
Chicago Cubs, 6-4, at Ho Ho Kam Park. It was the Angels' first victory of the 
spring, improving their record to 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk McCaskill, making his first start of the spring, was the winning pitcher, 
yielding one hit and one run, unearned, in three innings. He struck out three 
and walked one. . . . Lance Parrish made his first appearance at catcher for 
the Angels. At the plate, he went two for two, but behind the plate, he went 
zero for two attempting to throw out base stealers. "He didn't look too good on 
the stolen bases," Rader acknowledged, "but he's still working on mechanics. 
It'll come." . . . Dave Concepcion started and played all nine innings at 
second base, mainly because Johnny Ray's hamstring injury is healing slowly. 
Concepcion went hitless in two at-bats and dropped a pop fly along the 
right-field line for an error.

A MUCKRAKER'S VIEW OF THE PRIVILEGES OF ACADEMIC LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON, Times Education Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WANTED: University professor. Good salary. Little work. Lots of prestige. 
Possible lifetime security. Not much contact with students. Plenty of time to 
research your own obscure interests. Good chance for government grants and 
corporate consulting. 
</P>
<P>
 If Charles J. Sykes headed the employment office of a big research university, 
his advertisements to fill faculty openings would read something like that. 
However, Sykes is a journalist and his scathing appraisal of American 
universities is contained, not in an ad, but in his new -- and much criticized 
-- book titled "ProfScam: Professors and the Demise of Higher Education." 
"ProfScam" is a litany of grievances against what Sykes sees as professors' 
flight from teaching undergraduates to the privileges of academic research. 
Much of the resulting scholarship, he claims, is as useless to the rest of the 
world as a dissertation he cites about potholders as art. 
</P>
<P>
Sykes, the son of a professor, calls academia "one of society's most outrageous 
and elaborate frauds. It is replete with the pieties, arcane rituals, rites of 
passages and dogmas of a secular faith. It also has an intimidating and 
mysterious argot (best described as profspeak) and a system of perks and 
privileges that would put the most hidebound bureaucrat to shame." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, he says, students get "watered-down courses, unqualified 
instructors, a bachelor's degree of dubious value and an outrageous bill for 
spending four or five years in a ghetto of appalling intellectual squalor and 
mediocrity." 
</P>
<P>
"ProfScam," (published by Regnery Gateway, Washington) is criticized by some 
academic leaders as being anti-intellectual, simplistic and poorly done. By 
focusing on the abuses by a few professors at some very large institutions, the 
book insults all hard-working, dedicated teachers across the country, they 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no nation in the world that does not covet the system of higher 
education in the United States," said Carol Simpson Stern, president of the 
American Assn. of University Professors. "Were his picture accurate, I doubt 
that would be the case." 
</P>
<P>
Jack H. Schuster, professor of education and public policy at the Claremont 
Graduate School, said Sykes' contentions are "real garbage." 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, sure, there are a lot of faculty members out of 44,000 (nationally) who 
don't do their jobs well, are disengaged, are tired," said Schuster, who 
co-wrote a 1986 book about the lives of professors. "But to condemn the entire 
professoriate for negligence and malfeasance does a gross disservice to the 
great majority who are engaged and competent. I for one believe it is a gross 
distortion of reality." 
</P>
<P>
Still, academic leaders agree that Sykes is tapping a well of anger against big 
universities, often aggravated by the frightening price of tuition. The 
Chronicle of Higher Education, academia's bible, recently had an article about 
"ProfScam" on its front page and cited it again in a piece about how colleges 
are paying more attention to staff ethics. 
</P>
<P>
Ernest Boyer, head of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, 
said his reading of excerpts convinced him that Sykes "caricatures the 
problems" and generalizes far too much but "what is valuable and on target is 
that undergraduates, especially freshmen and sophomores at many of the large 
institutions, do not get the kind of teaching and educational attention they 
deserve." Many schools are trying to change that, according to Boyer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Large Public Response 
</P>
<P>
The Milwaukee Journal, where Sykes was a reporter for six years, recently 
published excerpts of his book. The newspaper was overwhelmed with letters from 
readers, more than half of whom thanked Sykes for tossing a grenade into 
academia's cloistered tea party. Wisconsin undergraduates complained about huge 
and impersonal classes, incoherent curricula and teaching assistants whose 
foreign accents make lectures incomprehensible. Other letters defended 
professors, calling them overworked and underpaid. 
</P>
<P>
According to Sykes' publisher, about 15,000 copies of the book have been 
shipped and a third printing is likely -- far from best-sellerdom but a 
respectable showing for a university-oriented book. At UCLA's student 
bookstore, the first small order sold out and several people have ordered 
"ProfScam," according to a staffer there. 
</P>
<P>
Other recent books, such as Allan Bloom's "The Closing of the American Mind" 
and E. D. Hirsch's "Cultural Literacy: What Every American Needs to Know," 
argued in fairly lofty terms for return to basics and classics in higher 
education. Boyer's 1987 book, "College," argued in a scholarly way for 
improvements in undergraduate studies. "ProfScam" is more of a muckraking, 
populist tract spiced with quotable putdowns. Its author concedes that he made 
little attempt to offer balance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Nature of the Book' 
</P>
<P>
"That's in the nature of the book like this," Sykes said from Milwaukee where 
he lives. "Ralph Nader didn't write about all the good cars at General Motors. 
He wrote about the Corvairs." 
</P>
<P>
Of Sykes' own experiences with academia, he said that his late father, Jay G. 
Sykes, a professor of journalism at the University of Wisconsin, wrote an 
article sharply critical of the university and the piece was published a few 
months after his death in 1985 in Milwaukee Magazine; Charles Sykes was editor. 
The book grew out of that article. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Endangered Species 
</P>
<P>
As for his own student days at the University of Wisconsin during the early 
'70s, Sykes said he has no complaints. "I really made a point of searching out 
the best professors on campus. Many of them were the older teachers who still 
had a traditional outlook. But since 1975, priorities shifted and those 
professors are an endangered species." 
</P>
<P>
According to Sykes, what younger professors want to do is spend little time 
with students and lots of time on their own research, which will win them 
tenure, grants and outside business contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Parents and students are victims, Sykes asserted, of what he calls a 
bait-and-switch scam at many large research universities: People want to attend 
those schools because of the prestige, but the prestige is based not on 
undergraduate teaching but on what research the professors get published. 
</P>
<P>
Lifetime tenure is one of Sykes' villains. The choices for lifetime tenure are 
mainly made by professors who already have tenure. So, while tenure is supposed 
to ensure intellectual freedom, the process of gaining tenure ensures the 
opposite, Sykes said. Young teachers, he said, "must often be very careful to 
produce research that confirms the intellectual orthodoxy of the moment and 
flatters the older professors." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Renewable Contracts 
</P>
<P>
Sykes wants tenure abolished and replaced by five-year renewable contracts, 
with teaching skills emphasized as much as research. He also calls on 
legislators to require that all professors at state institutions teach at least 
three courses -- or about nine credit hours -- a semester. 
</P>
<P>
The author said he visited Ivy League and big state universities around the 
country -- including Harvard, Yale, UC Berkeley and the University of Illinois 
-- interviewing students, teachers and administrators during his research for 
the book. He also cites scholarly journals, educational experts, campus 
newspapers and even student guidebooks as his sources. 
</P>
<P>
Stern, the professors' association president, said that Sykes ignores "a very 
deep connection between teaching and scholarship. They feed each other in a 
fertile way." 
</P>
<P>
Donna Shalala, chancellor of the University of Wisconsin's Madison campus, 
called the book "a cheap shot at a soft ankle" and said that Sykes does not 
understand that the task of research universities is to train scholars as well 
as teach undergraduates. And, Shalala pondered, if the public is so 
dissatisfied with big-name state schools, why is it harder than ever to gain 
admission to such universities as UC Berkeley? 
</P>
<P>
However, Sykes shrugs off such criticism and seems pleased with his reputation 
as a rabble-rouser and the resulting controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Sykes promises to return in the near future with another book, a guidebook on 
how to choose a college.

YOUR BODY: CAFFEINE LOADING FOR ATHLETES: SIDE EFFECTS OUTWEIGH BENEFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Do large doses of caffeine -- in the form of coffee, colas or tablets -- help 
recreational athletes perform longer and better? 
</P>
<P>
Possibly, but because caffeine overconsumption has been linked to irregular 
heartbeat and dehydration, experts generally discourage overuse. 
</P>
<P>
Caffeine can be effective in improving endurance and performance in activities 
lasting 90 minutes or more, exercise experts say. "But there are side effects," 
said Steve Farrell, associate director of continuing education for the 
Institute for Aerobics Research in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Caffeine, a diuretic, speeds dehydration and, in some people, overconsumption 
can lead to cardiac arrhythmias or irregular heartbeat. "We don't endorse its 
use (for performance improvement)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nor does the U.S. Olympic Committee, which considers excess caffeine a banned 
substance, a spokesman said. To test positive, an athlete would need to drink 
six to eight cups of coffee three hours before testing. 
</P>
<P>
It appears "to stimulate the release of fats into the blood, which the muscles 
can use for energy in place of glycogen, thereby sparing it for later use," 
according to the Tufts University Diet &amp; Nutrition Letter. However, 
potential benefits of extra caffeine are limited to endurance athletes, such as 
marathon runners or swimmers, the newsletter said. 
</P>
<P>
Drinking a single cup of coffee before a workout probably has little or no 
effect, Farrell said. "But I don't see any need for the average recreational 
athlete to use large amounts of caffeine." 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Bassett, an exercise physiologist at Centinela Hospital's National 
Athletic Fitness Institute in Culver City, said recreational athletes have more 
to gain from proper diet and training than caffeine dosing. 
</P>
<P>
It's All in Your Head 
</P>
<P>
Asked how they're feeling, hypochondriacs often reply -- ad nauseam. To them, a 
headache suggests a brain tumor; a chest twinge, certain death. 
</P>
<P>
In a given week, at least 10% of the population expresses some degree of 
hypochondriasis, an abnormal anxiety about one's health sometimes accompanied 
by imaginary illness reports Dr. Robert Kellner, in the current issue of the 
journal Psychosomatics. 
</P>
<P>
Hypochondriasis affects men and women equally, but "women are more likely to 
see a doctor about physical complaints for which there are no medical 
explanations," said Dr. Arthur Barsky, a Harvard Medical School associate 
professor of psychiatry also studying the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Those with a history of illness are more likely to be hypochondriacs, said 
Kellner, a professor and vice chairman of the department of psychiatry at the 
University of New Mexico, Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
Why do hypochondriacs agonize over symptoms, real or imagined? 
</P>
<P>
They are "often lonely, isolated people," Barsky said, and "complaining is a 
way to set up a social interaction." Those afflicted have a tendency for high 
anxiety and depression, which can make their hypochondriasis worse in the 
presence of unexplained bodily symptoms, Kellner said. 
</P>
<P>
"They may also feel symptoms more acutely," said Barsky, who is studying the 
possibility that hypochondriacs' nervous systems may be "tuned" differently. 
</P>
<P>
To some extent, attention and understanding can help. "Try to sort out what's 
really bothering the person," Barsky said. "At some point, it's not helpful to 
support the idea. It's a medical problem if there's no basis." 
</P>
<P>
Professional counseling is also recommended. "With psychotherapy, 50% or more 
can put hypochondriasis behind them," Kellner said. 
</P>
<P>
Call for Prenatal Care 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, more than 8% of women who gave birth in Los Angeles County received no 
prenatal care or didn't receive any until the third trimester of pregnancy, 
according to the county Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to change that, the department -- working with community service 
organizations -- has launched a new telephone service for pregnant women. 
Referrals to both public and private doctors are available through Healthline, 
(213) 250-8055, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Operators are 
multilingual.

ROCKWELL GETS RECORD FINE FOR DEFENSE FRAUD; 
</P>
<P>
CONTRACTOR IS ASSESSED $5.5-MILLION PENALTY FOR OVERBILLING AIR FORCE ON 
SATELLITE SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The largest-ever criminal fine in a defense procurement fraud case -- $5.5 
million -- was imposed Monday on Rockwell International Corp. for fraudulently 
overbilling the Air Force on a satellite navigation system. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Consuelo B. Marshall also ordered the giant aerospace 
contractor to pay restitution of $446,248 and placed the corporation on 
probation for five years, during which the company could be subject to further 
fines if it engages in any other fraud against the government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fine Called 'Draconian' 
</P>
<P>
The fine, which attorneys for the company called "Draconian," was larger than 
the $5-million penalty government prosecutors had sought for Rockwell's 
conditional guilty plea to charges of overbilling the government by nearly 
$500,000 on the $1.2-billion NAVSTAR global positioning system. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell attorneys also predicted that the sentence will have a "chilling 
effect" on the aerospace industry's self-policing efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell has maintained from the beginning that the overcharging and subsequent 
cover-up were the work of two upper-level management employees in the firm's 
Seal Beach and Downey offices. 
</P>
<P>
But government prosecutors contend that high-level corporate officials knew 
about the cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
The company has retained the right to appeal the conviction based on Rockwell's 
assertion that it has been prosecuted for a fraud that company officials 
discovered themselves and voluntarily revealed to the government under a Reagan 
Administration disclosure program. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to defend yourself when you've already turned your entire 
investigative files over to the government," said lawyer James F. Neal, private 
counsel for the corporation. 
</P>
<P>
"I had hoped and thought that there should be significant consideration given 
to the fact that it wasn't aggressive law enforcement that caused us to be 
here," Neal said. "It was vigorous self-policing by Rockwell." 
</P>
<P>
But government prosecutors said Rockwell disclosed the overbilling only after 
Defense Department auditors had begun asking questions about the NAVSTAR 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"Would Rockwell have set the auditors straight . . . if they had not first 
raised (the overbilling) as a problem?" asked Assistant U.S. Atty. George 
Newhouse, who prosecuted the case with Assistant U.S. Atty. Stephen A. 
Mansfield. "To believe that Rockwell would have done this would have required a 
belief in something akin to the sugar fairy." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. Robert C. Bonner, who made a rare court appearance arguing for a 
stringent fine, said the $5.5-million penalty is the largest criminal fine ever 
imposed on a defense contractor, though restitution orders in some cases may 
have been larger. The fine, government prosecutors said, represents less than 
1% of Rockwell's $812 million profits for 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"We're quite pleased, and we hope that a fine of that magnitude will send out a 
message to the defense industry that the federal courts are taking defense 
procurement fraud very seriously," Bonner said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Rockwell predicted that the fine will have a chilling effect on 
defense contractors' participation in the federal voluntary disclosure program, 
designed to relieve companies from liability if they volunteer information 
about defense fraud, reimburse the government for any losses and take steps to 
correct it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Some Hesitation' 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will cause some hesitation on the part of contractors in cases like 
this," said Thomas E. Holliday, another private counsel for the firm. 
</P>
<P>
In court, Rockwell attorneys emphasized that the company's guilty plea was 
based on a doctrine of law under which the company must accept legal 
responsibility for the actions of company managers Donald H. Carter and Robert 
L. Zavodnik, both employees at Rockwell's Satellite Systems Division, who were 
also indicted. 
</P>
<P>
Zavodnik, who was fired in October, 1986, pleaded guilty and agreed to testify 
against Carter, his supervisor. Carter was acquitted at trial but was also 
eventually forced to leave the company. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment accused Rockwell of obtaining secret reimbursement for 
unexpected repair costs on the NAVSTAR project from a subcontractor and then 
billing the Air Force for the same costs. The conspiracy count to which the 
company pleaded guilty also alleged that Rockwell attempted to cover up the 
fraud when federal auditors began asking questions. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Zavodnik met with auditors and delivered a speech blaming the 
erroneous charging on the "iterative process" -- an allegation he later 
admitted was deliberately intended to confuse auditors. 
</P>
<P>
Government prosecutors argued in court Monday that high-level corporate 
officials knew about the cover-up and may in fact have directed it. 
</P>
<P>
"Rockwell attempts, your honor, to hold Carter and Zavodnik up as scapegoats," 
Newhouse said. But "members of corporate management, including the corporate 
legal department, were aware of the deception. They were aware that a fraud on 
the DCAA (Defense Contract Audit Agency) was occurring. . . . They allowed the 
DCAA to be fooled." 
</P>
<P>
Neal heatedly rebutted that assertion, alleging that government prosecutors 
during Carter's trial elicited testimony from Rockwell employees involved in 
the cover-up showing that they were more afraid of management finding out about 
the fraud than about the government discovering it. 
</P>
<P>
"If the government believes corporate management is guilty of these offenses, 
they should have gone to the mat, as we would have, and not entered into this 
plea agreement," Neal said. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after the sentencing, Rockwell again emphasized that it 
entered the guilty plea only because of its legal responsibility for its 
employees' actions. 
</P>
<P>
"Rockwell was sentenced today because of our responsibility under the law for 
the actions of our employees. We accept that responsibility, but we continue to 
believe that the company itself should not have been indicted," the company 
said.

Declaring that their future standard of living is at stake, two major 
developing countries, China and India, said Monday that they want additional 
aid from industrialized countries before they are willing to sign an 
international accord to protect the ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
In strongly worded requests before delegates from 124 nations attending an 
ozone conference here, they challenged industrialized countries to establish an 
international fund to enable them to switch to more expensive but 
environmentally desirable chemicals that do not erode the ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
Until that time comes, they indicated, it will be difficult for them to sign 
the Montreal Protocol, an international accord that calls for a 50% reduction 
in the production and use of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, by the turn of the 
century. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Call by Thatcher, Bush 
</P>
<P>
President Bush and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher have called for 
even more drastic action, a phasing out of all CFCs by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
CFCs are extensively used in refrigeration, air conditioning and industrial 
processes considered essential by developing countries in raising their 
standard of living. But scientists say they are also destroying the Earth's 
ozone layer, which protects plant and animal life from ultraviolet radiation 
from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
The positions taken by China and India are considered crucial to the long-term 
prospects of successfully reducing the threat to the ozone layer posed by CFCs. 
While the two countries now account for about 10% of the world's production and 
use of CFCs, the potential for growth as China and India industrialize to meet 
the expectations of burgeoning populations is considered immense. 
</P>
<P>
Just hours after the conference adjourned, the developing countries received a 
royal endorsement from Britain's Prince Charles during a dinner for conference 
delegates at the British Museum. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech that Buckingham Palace said the heir to the British throne 
considered one of the most important of his life, Charles said he realizes the 
dilemma faced by developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
"While we simply must eliminate CFCs . . . we must not do so by forcing 
developing nations to forgo some of the benefits of industrialization which 
developed countries have enjoyed for so long," the prince said. 
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, the call by developing nations to the developed ones to 
provide tangible assistance, for instance through appropriate technology 
transfer, is a powerful one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the prince challenged political leaders to act promptly to 
save the ozone shield. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the Industrial Revolution, human beings have been upsetting that balance 
(of nature), persistently choosing the short-term options and to hell with the 
long-term repercussions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that countless numbers of people are looking to their leaders 
and representatives to take bold decisions now -- decisions which our 
descendants, yet unborn, will thank us for -- and not put off those critical 
decisions that will ultimately cause our grandchildren to curse us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, held at a conference center directly across the street from 
Westminster Abbey, Western nations said they are generally sympathetic to the 
pleas for assistance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. to Alter Aid Priorities 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William K. Reilly told 
reporters that the United States plans to "alter our priorities of foreign 
assistance." More emphasis will be placed on urging the World Bank and other 
international lending agencies to take the environment into account, Reilly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Without being specific, he also said the Bush Administration will look at its 
own foreign aid policies. But he cautioned that in view of the federal budget 
deficit, more funds for global environmental concerns are unlikely to be added 
to the budget. Instead, he said, existing funds will be diverted from other 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly said that Japan and the 12-nation European Community, which both enjoy 
budget surpluses, should also contribute. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, India made it clear that increasing foreign assistance for 
environmental causes at the expense of other aid is unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
Z. R. Ansari, the Indian environmental minister, told the conference: "Any 
reduction in these resources for whatever reason would mean that the poor of 
these countries will have to wait longer for the promised freedom from hunger 
and poverty. Today, the poor are no more prepared to wait, and there will be a 
social upheaval if they are asked to wait any longer." 
</P>
<P>
Ansari also charged that industrialized countries are paying little attention 
to a provision in the Montreal Protocol that requires them to offer technical 
assistance to developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
"I would urge you to consider whether it is fair for the governments of the 
developed world to sign a protocol which contains provisions for technical 
assistance . . . but wash their hands off when it comes to the implementation 
of its provisions," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blunt Talk 
</P>
<P>
Minutes earlier, in unusually blunt language, Liu Mingpu, the Chinese 
environmental protection commissioner, called for an international fund that 
would allow China to receive technology being developed in the West free of 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
"Such an approach would be preferable to that of engaging in a futile exercise 
of imposing on developing countries still suffering from famine and economic 
hardship (and) telling them what to do or what not to do," Liu said. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-one nations have signed and ratified the Montreal Protocol. On Monday, 
Iceland, Poland, Gambia, Turkey, Tonga, Brazil and Ethiopia announced they will 
sign the accord. Six other nations -- Austria, Hungary, Malaysia, Trinidad and 
Tobago, the Philippines and Zambia -- said Sunday that they will sign. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Soviet delegation surprised the conference by declaring 
there is insufficient scientific evidence to justify speeding the phase-out of 
CFCs as proposed by the United States and the European Community. 
</P>
<P>
"Any decision taken under the (Montreal Protocol) should be well grounded and 
have a firm scientific basis," said Vladimir Zakharov, the ranking Soviet 
delegate. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets said that the depleted ozone levels found over the Soviet Union 
were caused by localized weather conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet view was roundly disputed by UC Irvine Prof. Sherwood Rowland, who, 
with his colleague, Mario J. Molina, first warned that CFCs are destroying the 
ozone layer. Rowland told The Times that between 1969 and 1986, the winter 
season ozone loss over Siberia and Leningrad averaged 10%, and 6% to 7% during 
that period over Central Asia. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials called Zakharov's statement surprising and speculated that 
economic concerns are behind the Soviet stance. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Science and Technology 
Subcommittee, told reporters the Soviets enjoy a special provision in the 
existing protocol that allows them to build a new CFC plant, already under 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
"Then they pretend there is some uncertainty about the basic science, which 
there is not. . . . It's unbecoming," Gore told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly was more charitable. "It's an evolving picture," he said of the state of 
scientific knowledge. He said the Soviets may require more time to assess the 
data. 
</P>
<P>
But he concluded: "We believe in the United States that the scientific 
information does compel a faster phase-out of CFCs."

IMMIGRATION CHIEF NELSON IS EXPECTED TO BE REPLACED 
</P>

<P>
Alan C. Nelson, who has presided over the government's massive program to give 
legal status to illegal aliens, will be replaced as commissioner of the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service, despite his concerted effort to hold on 
to the post, Administration sources said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure of his expected departure comes in the wake of a recent Justice 
Department audit that was highly critical of management practices in the 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said that Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, whose department oversees the 
INS, is eager to bring "new blood" to the service. 
</P>
<P>
A Justice Department spokesman said that President Bush "has indicated he would 
like to see major turnover of people in the Administration to reflect his views 
and priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"The attorney general has been engaged in the process of interviewing people 
for major positions," said the spokesman, David Runkel. "No determination has 
been made with regard to INS." 
</P>
<P>
Other sources said, however, that although the search is under way for a new 
commissioner, no decision on a replacement is expected this month. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson has been the target of strong criticism for the agency's plan to dig a 
four-mile-long ditch on the Mexico-California border near San Diego to deter 
smuggling, and for the agency's response to the influx of Central American 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, who did not return a reporter's call Monday, was incensed over an 
internal Justice Department audit last week that charged that his agency was 
riddled with mismanagement. The audit cited such problems as missing documents, 
massive backlogs of cases and failure to conduct background checks on many 
applicants for citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the plans to replace Nelson, Greg Leo, his chief spokesman, 
said: "We're not in a position to confirm or deny that. To the best of my 
knowledge, he has not been told that. I just talked to him." 
</P>
<P>
One INS official who favors Nelson's retention said that the audit by the 
Justice Department's management division was designed to undermine his efforts 
to stay in the job. Since Bush's election, Nelson has been lobbying transition 
officials to keep him in the position. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a hatchet job," the official said of the audit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Series of Audits 
</P>
<P>
However, Justice Department officials said that Thornburgh's management 
practice relies on such audits to evaluate the performance of agencies 
responsible to him. They noted that he made frequent use of such audits when he 
was governor of Pennsylvania and that audits of the INS and Marshals Service 
are only the first in a series of such assessments. 
</P>
<P>
Several immigrant rights activists said they were not surprised that Nelson 
would be ushered out. "There are enough people out there who want him out to 
start a club," said Mario Moreno of the Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson's handling of the agency has been controversial for several years. A 
former San Francisco attorney who took over the job in 1982, he oversaw the 
implementation of the landmark 1986 immigration reform law and was sharply 
criticized by alien advocates for allegedly being slow in informing the public 
about the measure's provisions. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, whose friendship with former Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III dated back to 
their days in California, weathered that storm. 
</P>
<P>
However, acrimony flared anew with disclosure in January of INS plans to 
construct the $2-million border ditch. Many critics likened it to the Berlin 
Wall, complaining that it reflected insensitivity to the concerns of immigrants 
who cross the border seeking a better life in the United States. The government 
of Mexico has told the Administration of its opposition to the ditch. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson and Thornburgh also have had differences since Thornburgh assumed the 
top Justice Department post late in the Ronald Reagan Administration, several 
immigration experts said. "There's no love lost" between them, one said. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Kamasaki of the National Council of La Raza said that Nelson "started 
with a disadvantage. He not only was a holdover; he was particularly identified 
with Meese, and Thornburgh and Bush don't have any particular affinity for 
Meese." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Has Ally in Simpson 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Nelson has had a strong ally in Sen. Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.), a 
principal author of the 1986 immigration law. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Simpson said that the senator "has indicated to everybody that 
he can that he supports Alan. But his support is no guarantee of a job in this 
Administration." 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman recounted a conversation in which Simpson expressed his support 
and Bush replied: "OK, Al, thanks; it's important for me to know what you 
think." 
</P>
<P>
Although several people have been mentioned as possible successors to Nelson, 
no front-runner is now apparent, Administration sources said.

2 IN GOP HELP ASSAULT GUN BAN PASS STATE SENATE UNIT

Legislation to ban the sale and possession of military weapons such as the 
assault rifle used to slay five schoolchildren in Stockton last month received 
a big boost Monday when two Senate Republicans joined Democrats in voting to 
approve it. 
</P>
<P>
On a 9 to 2 vote, the Senate Appropriations Committee endorsed the politically 
sensitive measure by Senate leader David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), who 
pronounced himself "very optimistic" that it would clear the full Senate as 
early as Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
To secure favorable votes from the committee, Roberti weakened the bill 
somewhat with amendments, a tactic that failed to win over or neutralize the 
National Rifle Assn., which has mounted a major campaign to defeat the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
NRA representative David Marshall complained to the committee that the 
amendments, rather than clarifying the legislation, would create more confusion 
over the difference between a legal sporting firearm and an illegal gun. 
</P>
<P>
But Roberti, flushed with victory, declared after the committee vote that "it 
is clear we are getting Republican support. . . . They recognize that the 
purpose of the bill is to just get assault weapons out of the hands of the 
general public and it has nothing to do with banning legitimate sporting 
weapons." 
</P>
<P>
Last week in the Judiciary Committee, the bill was barely approved, receiving a 
"no" vote from each Republican member along with two Democrats. Although the 
gun control issue has always been politically delicate for members of both 
parties, Republicans traditionally are more reluctant than Democrats to vote in 
favor of additional restraints on gun ownership. 
</P>
<P>
But in the Appropriations Committee on Monday, Republicans Marian Bergeson of 
Newport Beach and Robert B. Beverly of Manhattan Beach joined seven Democrats 
in voting "aye." The bill needed at least seven favorable votes. 
</P>
<P>
GOP Sens. William Campbell of Hacienda Heights and James W. Nielsen of Rohnert 
Park voted "no." Democratic Sen. Bill Lockyer of Hayward, who voted against the 
measure last week in the Judiciary Committee, abstained in the appropriations 
panel's vote. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti, who a few weeks ago described himself as moderately cautious about the 
bill's prospects, upgraded his confidence rating to "very optimistic" Monday 
and said he believes both Democratic and GOP senators "now recognize that we 
have a common obligation to get assault weapons out of the hands of the general 
public." 
</P>
<P>
The bill is sponsored by top law enforcement officers throughout the state, who 
maintain that gang members and drug traffickers with semiautomatic military 
combat weapons are outgunning police officers and that such criminals are 
terrorizing entire neighborhoods in Los Angeles and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would ban the manufacture, sale, general possession and transfer of 
semiautomatic military assault weapons, such as the Chinese-made AK-47 that 
Patrick Edward Purdy fired at least 106 times into the Stockton schoolyard on 
Jan. 17, killing five children and wounding 29 others and a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Purdy's weapon was purchased over the counter in Oregon, where rifle ownership 
laws are similar to those of California. In California, anyone 18 years or 
older can buy such a gun by showing standard identification and filling out a 
federal form declaring that he or she is not, among other things, a drug addict 
or fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
To meet the concerns of lawmakers such as Sen. Robert B. Presley (D-Riverside), 
Roberti agreed to weaken the bill so that an appointed "assault weapons" 
commission would be purely advisory rather than a powerful regulatory entity. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the panel would have had the authority, whenever a new gun came on 
the market, to determine whether it should be exempt from the ban on 
semiautomatic arms. But many lawmakers objected to the notion of a commission 
appointed by the governor and Legislature deciding which guns were "good" and 
which were "bad." 
</P>
<P>
Roberti agreed to make the commission an advisory agency, whose recommendations 
to approve or ban new guns would be made to the Legislature. The final decision 
would be left to the Legislature and governor. 
</P>
<P>
In the Assembly, a bill by Assemblyman Mike Roos (R-Los Angeles) proposed a 
similar commission, but he abandoned the commission in the face of major 
opposition. The Roos bill also would outlaw about 40 semiautomatic firearms by 
model and manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the Roberti bill contains a generalized definition of the 
semiautomatic assault weapon, which would encompass a vast array of firearms. 
Law enforcement organizations that drafted the legislation insisted on this 
feature. Supporters maintain that such a broad definition is necessary to 
prevent the manufacture and sale of "look-alike" assault weapons, those that 
closely resemble weapons that would be banned. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti also added to the bill another 10 semiautomatic rifles that would be 
exempted from the prohibition, all of them currently considered hunting arms. 
The bill previously listed about 27 "good" guns that would be exempted. 
</P>
<P>
Here is how the Appropriations Committee voted: 
</P>
<P>
Democrats voting aye (7) -- Alfred E. Alquist of San Jose; Ruben S. Ayala of 
Chino; Daniel E. Boatwright of Concord; Wadie P. Deddeh of Bonita; Ralph C. 
Dills of Gardena; Art Torres of Los Angeles, and Presley. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans voting aye (2) -- Bergeson and Beverly. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats voting no (0) -- None. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans voting no (2) -- Campbell of Hacienda Heights and Nielsen of 
Rohnert Park.

LIQUIDATION ORDER CLEARS WAY TO PAY INSURANCE CLAIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A court order to liquidate the bankrupt Coastal Insurance Co. was issued Monday 
by a Los Angeles judge, clearing the way, after more than a month, for claims 
against Coastal's 200,000 California auto insurance policies to be honored by a 
state-appointed guarantee association. 
</P>
<P>
The director of the California Insurance Guarantee Assn., John W. Gates, said 
claims payments on Coastal policies should resume within two weeks, offering 
the prospect of relief for hundreds of persons whose claims have remained 
unpaid. 
</P>
<P>
Since Feb. 2, when state Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie placed Coastal 
into conservatorship, hundreds of car repairs and medical treatments for which 
Coastal was responsible have gone unpaid. In some cases, body shops would not 
proceed with repairs, or medical treatments had to be deferred. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance Department officials have estimated that about 700 claims are made 
each month against Coastal's policies, so, in the roughly six weeks of a 
claims-paying hiatus, about 1,000 claims may go unpaid. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unopposed by Company 
</P>
<P>
The request by Gillespie to terminate Coastal Insurance went unopposed by 
Coastal before Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs, and Janavs immediately took 
the action. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the head of a consumers group, Steven Miller of the Insurance 
Consumer Action Network, said he was seeking to intercede on behalf of a San 
Fernando Valley medical clerk whose repaired car has been held by the owner of 
a Van Nuys body shop for the last two weeks because a Coastal check issued for 
the work had bounced. 
</P>
<P>
The clerk, Diana Ruiz, said Monday in an interview that on Feb. 14, 12 days 
after Coastal was placed into conservatorship, the owner of Harry's Body Shop, 
Harry Hezar, accepted a Coastal draft as payment for $2,600 in repairs and let 
her drive her car home. 
</P>
<P>
However, she said, on Feb. 24, Hezar called her and said there may have been a 
fault in the repairs and asked her to take the car back in. 
</P>
<P>
When she did, Ruiz said, Hezar seized the vehicle, padlocked it, told her that 
the Coastal draft had bounced and that he would not release her car until he 
received full payment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Different Version 
</P>
<P>
Hezar tells a somewhat different story. He said in an interview Monday that 
Ruiz had called him and wanted to take the car in for an adjustment. But he 
confirmed that when it got to his shop, he had padlocked it and still refuses 
to release it. 
</P>
<P>
Hezar said he had provided another car and a driver to take Ruiz, her husband 
and their three small children home after seizing their car. Ruiz, Hezar said, 
had been so angry that she kicked the vehicle after it arrived at her home. 
</P>
<P>
Hezar said his lawyer had advised him to release the car on grounds that when 
the Guarantee Assn. starts paying Coastal claims he will get his money. But, he 
said, he is holding it because he is not satisfied of the certainty or 
timeliness of payment. 
</P>
<P>
Miller and Ruiz said the body shop owner is being unreasonable and Miller said 
the Ruiz story is only one of a number of hardship cases he has heard lately. 
</P>
<P>
The insurance commissioner's filing with the court said Coastal Insurance was 
at least $39.8 million in the red. Since the conservatorship, Coastal's parent 
company, Advent Management Co., has also filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Harry O. Miller, the chief executive of both Coastal and Advent, was 
responsible last year for the companies' giving or lending a total of 
$5,249,852 in their assets to support Proposition 101 on the November ballot. 
The proposed insurance initiative, one of five on the ballot, won a scant 13% 
of the popular vote.

PARTNERS IN SURVIVAL -- TORTOISE, WASTE SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Businessman Ron Gaynor would like to dig a huge hole in the Mojave Desert where 
he can bury low-level radioactive waste. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, biologist Alice Karl has long wanted to protect the desert 
tortoise from extinction. 
</P>
<P>
And so the two have formed an unlikely alliance designed to bring a low-level 
radioactive waste dump to an isolated spot in the desert that is home to 
dwindling numbers of the tortoise. 
</P>
<P>
Gaynor, senior vice president of US Ecology, a waste management firm, has 
selected a 100-acre site in the Ward Valley 22 miles west of Needles as the 
preferred location for California's first low-level radioactive waste facility. 
</P>
<P>
To make up for the loss of tortoise territory, the firm proposes to build a 
barrier two feet high across 7 1/2 miles of the valley. The unusual fence, 
designed to reclaim a portion of the species' original habitat, would keep the 
slow-footed reptiles from wandering onto a busy stretch of Interstate 40 that 
runs through the middle of the valley. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tortoises Come Out Ahead 
</P>
<P>
"If we can decrease the effect of the freeway, there is going to be a net 
benefit for the tortoises in Ward Valley," said Karl, who was recruited by US 
Ecology to study the animals. 
</P>
<P>
The question of where to place the federally required dump underscores a 
growing conflict between two environmental concerns: preserving the habitats of 
rare species and finding remote locations to safely store ever-increasing 
amounts of hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, surprisingly, selection of the Ward Valley site has generated few cries of 
outrage so far. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents of Needles have overcome their initial fear of low-level 
radioactive waste -- material contaminated by radiation, such as protective 
clothing, used medical supplies and power plant water filters. Needles Mayor 
Robert C. Prochaska said local people favor putting the dump near their town 
because of the two dozen permanent jobs it will offer. 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Club, which was among a number of groups consulted by the state 
government and US Ecology, reluctantly agrees that Ward Valley is the best 
place to dump the waste. 
</P>
<P>
The state, which awarded US Ecology the contract to find a site and operate the 
dump, insisted that the firm consult local citizens and environmental 
organizations in an attempt to resolve their concerns, such as protecting the 
tortoise. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, some officials say the involvement of these groups early in the 
planning process could provide a model for siting other difficult projects in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
"It's controversial, but it may be a controversy that was resolved because it 
was honestly approached," said state Health and Welfare Undersecretary Thomas 
E. Warriner, whose agency oversees the selection and operation of the disposal 
site. "I think it displayed sensitivity on the part of the government toward 
people who lived nearby and are affected by this." 
</P>
<P>
But for some, the siting of the low-level radioactive waste dump in Ward Valley 
is a sad commentary on the plight of the desert tortoise, which can live to the 
age of 90 and grow to a length of 14 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Dodson, a Sierra Club volunteer who took part in the planning sessions, 
said it was simple enough for US Ecology to find a way to help the tortoise 
with freeway fencing because so little is being done now to protect the 
reptile. The state should have built such barriers long ago on many stretches 
of the highway, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm one of the pessimists who believes we're seeing the extinction of the 
desert tortoise," said Dodson, a budget officer at Edwards Air Force Base. 
"Statistics all indicate the population is dropping below the necessary density 
for breeding." 
</P>
<P>
There are now about 60,000 tortoises living in the deserts of California, 
according to an estimate by the federal Bureau of Land Management. In some 
areas of the reptile's habitat, particularly the western Mojave, the tortoise 
population has declined by as much as 40% in just six years, surveys by the 
agency show. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's in Trouble' 
</P>
<P>
Encroaching suburban development, off-road vehicle traffic, desert grazing by 
sheep and cattle, predation by ravens and the spread of a deadly virus by pet 
tortoises released from captivity all have taken a toll on the animal. 
</P>
<P>
"If the decline in population continues, it's in trouble," said Hugh Riecken, 
associate manager of the BLM for California. "We are doing everything we can to 
protect as much of the habitat as we can." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, both the federal and state governments have resisted listing the 
tortoise as a threatened or endangered species -- a move that could lead to 
stricter land-use controls. 
</P>
<P>
The state Fish and Game Commission has delayed until June a decision on whether 
to identify the tortoise as threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials oppose such a designation, preferring instead to adopt 
protective measures such as shooting ravens, fencing certain roads, educating 
the public and finding a cure for the tortoise virus, Riecken said. 
</P>
<P>
Ward Valley is one of the prime California habitats for the desert tortoise. 
</P>
<P>
Lying between the Turtle Mountains to the east and the Old Woman Mountains to 
the west, Ward Valley is a long strip of largely untouched desert. Among the 
ubiquitous creosote and burro bushes, the burrows of tortoises, kit foxes and 
kangaroo rats dot the desert floor. Lizards abound, and the valley also is home 
to yuccas, barrel cactus, coyotes, jack rabbits, rattlesnakes and ravens. 
</P>
<P>
US Ecology chose Ward Valley from 18 locations it examined. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the least bad of the options that were found and looked at," conceded 
Dodson, the Sierra Club representative. "These wastes are being produced. 
Something needs to be done with them to store them in an appropriate manner." 
</P>
<P>
State Health Services Director Kenneth W. Kizer said he expects to give formal 
approval to the site next year after an extensive environmental review is 
completed. "Based on all the information we have so far, Ward Valley is the 
preferred site," Kizer said during a recent tour of the area with other state 
officials. "It's the best place." 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of putting the dump in Ward Valley point out that the 100-acre tract 
already has been subject to considerable human disturbance. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed site is about a mile south of Interstate 40. A power substation 
sits nearby. Giant transmission towers stand next to the property and extend 
off into the distance. A dirt road runs by the site and tracks left by off-road 
vehicles are clearly visible on the desert floor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ideal Conditions 
</P>
<P>
US Ecology and state officials say the valley is ideally suited for storing 
low-level radioactive waste. The water table is unusually deep, 700 feet below 
the surface. Rainfall in the area is minimal and runoff causes little erosion. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Ward Valley gets high ratings for its soil conditions and seismic 
stability. With the interstate freeway nearby and a railroad siding five miles 
away, hauling waste to the dump would not be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"The site was overwhelmingly considered the superior site," US Ecology's Gaynor 
said during the tour by state officials. "Obviously, the major negative factor 
is the tortoise." 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to protect the tortoise, US Ecology and the state are proposing a 
variety of steps they say would improve the reptile's habitat and keep 
fatalities to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
The largest undertaking would be the barrier designed to prevent the tortoises 
from being run over while crossing the freeway. Biologist Karl believes the 
interstate is the single biggest threat to the tortoises in the area -- far 
greater than putting a dump there. 
</P>
<P>
Vehicles speeding by at a rate of one every 11 seconds have killed more than 
1,000 tortoises since 1971, she estimates. During that time, the number of 
tortoises living within two miles of the freeway has dropped substantially -- 
particularly the males, which travel longer distances to mate, her research 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
Karl, who has been studying tortoises in the area since 1978, also is concerned 
that the freeway, by dividing the tortoise population in half, has split the 
animal's gene pool, further reducing the chance of the species' survival. 
</P>
<P>
As proposed by US Ecology, the tortoise fence would be placed on each side of 
the highway at a cost of several hundred thousand dollars. The twin 7 
1/2-mile-long barriers would be attached to existing barbed wire fences and 
buried a foot underground to keep the tortoises from burrowing underneath. 
</P>
<P>
Once the fence is in place, Karl and state officials hope, the tortoises would 
begin crossing under the freeway through a wash and four culverts, reducing the 
number of highway deaths and reuniting the two segments of the population. 
</P>
<P>
Gaynor estimates that the fencing would reclaim more than 19,000 acres of 
tortoise habitat, far more than the 100 acres that would be lost to the waste 
dump. "We're treating it as if it were a threatened species," Gaynor said. 
</P>
<P>
US Ecology expects to displace an estimated 25 tortoises from the dump site 
itself. The reptiles would be relocated nearby and equipped with transmitters 
so their movements could be followed as part of a continuing study. 
</P>
<P>
Trucks delivering waste to the facility would be escorted along the entry road 
to make sure they do not run over any tortoises. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the firm would attempt to keep ravens from moving into the area 
and roosting on the facility's fences and buildings, from which they could 
easily prey on young tortoises in the area. One idea is to place strips of tiny 
needle-like spikes on the tops of the fences. 
</P>
<P>
"The opportunities are clearly there for the tortoise to come out better in the 
end," said David C. Nunenkamp, chief of the Office of Permit Assistance. "We 
can't control the tortoise, but he will certainly have a better chance than he 
does now." 
</P>
<P>
The search for a place to put low-level radioactive garbage in California began 
in 1983 after Congress passed a law requiring each state to open its own dump 
or make an agreement with other states for disposal of such waste. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Just Three Dumps 
</P>
<P>
Only three dumps in the nation -- in Nevada, Washington and South Carolina -- 
now accept low-level radioactive waste. Under the federal law, they will not be 
required to accept waste from other states after Jan. 1, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Among the major producers of the waste are nuclear power plants, hospitals, 
universities and industry. Most of it will cease to be radioactive in less than 
a 100 years, but in some cases the contamination will last as long as 500 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Spent fuel rods from nuclear power plants, which are far more radioactive, are 
not considered low-level radioactive waste and must be disposed of separately. 
</P>
<P>
Under California's plan, the Ward Valley site would accept low-level 
radioactive waste from within the state as well as from Arizona, North Dakota 
and South Dakota. After 30 years, California could decide to continue operating 
the facility or close it down and require one of its partner states to open a 
new dump. 
</P>
<P>
The Ward Valley facility is expected to open by the middle of 1991 -- making 
California the first state to begin operating a low-level radioactive waste 
site under the new federal system. 
</P>
<P>
US Ecology already has spent $10 million in planning for the dump, and its 
costs could reach $30 million before Ward Valley accepts its first barrel of 
radioactive waste. The money will be recovered from fees set by the state and 
charged to those who dispose of waste at the site. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best location despite the tortoise," said Health and Welfare 
Undersecretary Warriner after seeing the Ward Valley site for the first time. 
"Anyone who looks at it would be hard pressed to come up with a better answer."

WITNESS HINTS OF NORTH LINK TO REAGAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Lt. Col. Oliver L. North told a retired Air Force officer who helped him 
resupply Nicaragua's rebels that "someday the President will shake your hand," 
the officer told a federal court jury Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Retired Col. Robert C. Dutton said that North made the remark to him in 
September, 1986, after Dutton had solved tactical problems that prevented the 
Contras from receiving airdrops of weapons and medical supplies purchased with 
private donations. 
</P>
<P>
Dutton became the sixth prosecution witness at North's trial to link the former 
National Security Council aide with the resupply mission, despite North's 
repeated denials of his activities to members of Congress at that time. 
</P>
<P>
The most serious of 12 felony charges against North are that he gave false 
statements to Congress in 1985 and 1986 in response to questions about his 
assistance to the Contras and that he obstructed congressional inquiries. 
During this two-year period, Congress had voted repeatedly to prohibit U.S. 
military aid to rebel forces fighting the leftist Sandinista government of 
Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
North's defense is that his superiors in the Ronald Reagan Administration 
approved his activities but instructed him to conceal them from others, 
including Congress. 
</P>
<P>
On cross-examination of Dutton, Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., North's attorney, 
elicited testimony that Dutton and two others who had helped North in the 
Contra resupply mission -- retired Air Force officers Richard V. Secord and 
Richard B. Gadd -- all had taken part in a high-risk covert mission authorized 
by former President Jimmy Carter nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
That was the unsuccessful secret mission to Tehran to rescue 52 American 
hostages in the spring of 1980. The mission had to be aborted when Iranians 
discovered it in its final hours. The hostages were released in January, 1981, 
after 444 days in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oath of Secrecy 
</P>
<P>
Dutton said that because of an oath of secrecy, he was unable to describe his 
exact role, but that his military specialty had been "penetrating hostile 
territory." 
</P>
<P>
Gadd, like Dutton, previously had testified that he helped North assist the 
Contras as a tactical expert. Secord is a co-defendant of North's who will be 
tried separately later this year. 
</P>
<P>
Dutton said that North, in referring to a possible future handshake from 
Reagan, said that he intended to show his "top boss" some photos that Dutton 
had made of successful airdrops to the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
"Whom do you think he was referring to?" Sullivan asked. 
</P>
<P>
"The President," Dutton replied. 
</P>
<P>
Dutton said that the incident occurred soon after Congress had voted to begin 
funding the Contras again with a $100-million appropriation. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, meanwhile, told U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell that the judge 
was unfairly limiting Sullivan's attempts to show jurors that Dutton and Secord 
also had worked with North to trade weapons to Iran to obtain the release of 
other American hostages in Lebanon in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan was able to elicit a brief reference to the 1986 operation from 
Dutton. But Gesell said that detailed testimony about Iranian arms sales no 
longer is relevant to the trial, because the alleged diversion of arms-sale 
profits to the Contras by North was one of two central charges that the 
government dismissed in January. 
</P>
<P>
The charges were dropped after Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh determined that 
evidence needed by North to defend himself would require disclosure of 
top-secret government information. 
</P>
<P>
With jurors absent from the courtroom during a noon recess, Sullivan protested 
that "we've got to go back to basics. The indictment (against North) makes 
specific reference to the Iran initiative," he said. "The government's opening 
statement discusses the Iran initiative." 
</P>
<P>
But Gesell told Sullivan that he was giving him wide enough latitude on 
cross-examination and "I think you're being oversensitive. I'm just trying to 
move this along so we can end this trial while I'm still alive," said the 
78-year-old jurist.

ARAB DIES IN SHIN BET INTERROGATION CELL; 
</P>
<P>
GAZA DEATH MAY SPARK NEW CONTROVERSY INVOLVING ISRAELI AGENCY

<P>
A Palestinian man died in a Gaza Strip interrogation cell Monday in what 
Israeli political analysts and security sources said is likely to turn into 
another major controversy involving the Shin Bet, Israel's scandal-plagued 
security service. 
</P>
<P>
Two other Palestinians were shot and killed by troops during clashes in the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip in one of the most violent days of protest in the 
occupied territories in several weeks. Throughout the territories, Palestinians 
observed a one-day general strike called to protest the closure by Israeli 
military authorities of all 1,200 schools in the West Bank and eight of the 250 
schools in the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
The latest killings raised to nearly 400 the death toll from the 15-month-old 
intifada, the Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied 
territories. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Mysterious Circumstances' 
</P>
<P>
However, it was the death of 34-year-old Youssef Masri in a Gaza Strip 
detention cell that captured the most attention Monday, due to what Israel 
Radio said were the "mysterious circumstances" under which he died. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources said that Masri, from the Gaza town of Rafah, was beaten to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
Military officials said Masri was suffering from an ulcer and was treated for 
it shortly before he died. They refused to comment further. But one security 
source, conceding that the circumstances surrounding Masri's death were indeed 
suspect, predicted that the incident would cause "great embarrassment" for the 
Shin Bet, Israel's domestic secret service, which was interrogating Masri at 
the time of his death. 
</P>
<P>
Recalling previous incidents in which Shin Bet interrogators were either known 
or strongly suspected of having beaten prisoners to death, an Israeli political 
analyst added that Masri's death was likely to have "real reverberations . . . 
and assume the proportions of a major scandal." 
</P>
<P>
Few details about the incident were immediately available. Military officials 
said only that police and prison authorities were investigating the death, 
which occurred during the third day of Masri's interrogation by Shin Bet agents 
at the Gaza Strip Central Prison. 
</P>
<P>
The Shin Bet sections at this and other prisons in the West Bank and Gaza Strip 
are not under the authority of either the police or the prison system, and 
normal practice in the occupied territories is for suspects to be held 
incommunicado during their interrogations by the Shin Bet. Lawyers for 
Palestinians arrested for most intifada-related offenses such as stone-throwing 
complain that they are not allowed access to their clients until these 
interrogations have ended, usually in signed confessions. 
</P>
<P>
The discretion given to the Shin Bet in dealing with Arab prisoners has been 
hotly debated on several occasions over the last few years because of 
allegations about the use of torture and other forms of duress to extract 
confessions. 
</P>
<P>
In the most-publicized case to date, several senior Shin Bet officials were 
pardoned two years ago for their role in the cover-up of a incident in which 
two Palestinian terrorists, captured after hijacking a Tel Aviv-to-Ashkelon 
bus, were beaten to death in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials have long insisted that torture is not condoned. However, an 
Israeli commission appointed to investigate the bus affair and other 
allegations of illegality by the security services concluded that the Shin Bet 
used physical and psychological pressure to obtain confessions from suspects. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, the commission found that a suspect originally said by authorities 
to have died of pneumonia was in fact choked to death. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Embarrassing for Government 
</P>
<P>
Should it develop into a scandal of similar proportions, Masri's death would be 
particularly embarrassing for Israel in view of its heated rejection of a U.S. 
State Department report last month on alleged human rights violations by 
Israeli authorities in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
The report cited five cases in 1988 in which it said that "unarmed Palestinians 
in detention died under questionable circumstances or were clearly killed by 
the detaining officials." 
</P>
<P>
Punishments for such offenses, the report added, "were usually lenient, and 
there were many cases of unjustified killing which did not result in 
disciplinary actions or prosecutions." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the circumstances surrounding Masri's death, the latest incident is 
also expected to inflame passions in the occupied territories, where the army 
reported Monday that soldiers shot and killed one youth throwing stones in the 
Gaza refugee camp of Jabaliya and another man who tried to escape during a 
search and arrest operation in the West Bank town of Salem. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources said another 14 demonstrators were shot and wounded in 
scattered protests across the territories Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Military authorities in the Gaza Strip freed 130 Palestinian prisoners, 
arrested on suspicion of fomenting strife, in a good-will gesture to mark 
Sunday's Muslim holiday that commemorates the Prophet Mohammed's ascent to 
heaven.

Iran appeared ready Monday to cut ties with Britain over "The Satanic Verses," 
and Iran's official news agency said that Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi is 
supporting the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's order that British author Salman 
Rushdie be killed for blaspheming Islam. 
</P>
<P>
The news agency IRNA said that Kadafi supports the death decree, which a 
radical Palestinian leader vowed Sunday would be carried out by his guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
The United States on Monday condemned radical Palestinian leader Ahmed Jibril's 
vow to kill Rushdie and called on Syria, where his group is based, to prevent 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Western condemnation led by Britain of Khomeini's call for Rushdie's death 
provoked Tehran into setting a deadline of March 7 for London to recant and 
denounce the Indian-born writer or have their diplomatic ties broken. 
</P>
<P>
IRNA said Monday there has been no indication that statements by British 
leaders have gone far enough to meet Iran's demands, and a break appeared 
imminent. 
</P>
<P>
In Vienna, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, in a reference to 
the Rushdie affair, suggested Monday that the West should show respect for 
Iran's values. But he also pledged that Moscow would not seek to profit from 
the crisis in relations between Western countries and Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
In Jordan, an Islamic country, Religious Affairs Minister Abdulaziz Khayyat 
said Khomeini's call does not conform to Islamic law. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not Islam's way of confronting deviationists, refuters and disfigurers 
of Islam and apostates," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie, 41, now in hiding under guard in Britain, was born into a Muslim 
family in Bombay, India. 
</P>
<P>
In Israel, where 14% of the population is Muslim, Chief Rabbi Avraham Shapira 
urged that the book be banned to avoid offense. He also criticized Khomeini's 
death order, saying it was not up to any man to impose such a sentence. "It is 
in the hands of heaven," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Cyprus-based oil industry newsletter Middle East Economic Survey 
said that France and Japan have asked their oil companies to restrict purchases 
of Iranian crude oil. Such cutbacks could hinder Iran's plans to rebuild its 
oil industry, an important source of revenue as Iran tries to recover from its 
eight-year war with Iraq, the newsletter said.

CHINA ATTEMPTS TO HALT A FLOOD OF PEASANTS SEEKING JOBS IN CITIES

China ordered a halt Monday to the movement of hundreds of thousands of 
peasants who have flooded into major cities over the past month in search of 
work. 
</P>
<P>
The State Council, China's equivalent of a cabinet, said the influx from the 
countryside had turned law and order efforts into urban chaos. 
</P>
<P>
It instructed local authorities to "persuade" the peasants to leave the cities 
and go home, but it did not specify how this was to be achieved. It also 
ordered local authorities to prevent more peasants from leaving their homes and 
told railways and bus companies to reduce service in the areas most affected by 
the rural exodus. 
</P>
<P>
"We must collect our strength to persuade and stop the workers, so that they do 
not blindly go outside their own areas," the order said. "We must persuade 
(those in the cities) to return to their own villages." 
</P>
<P>
Hordes of peasants have poured into Beijing, prosperous Canton in south China's 
Guangdong province and other cities since the Chinese New Year festival last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Guangdong, bordering the British colony of Hong Kong, has been invaded by a 
work-hungry army of 2.5 million people and provincial authorities have warned 
that the peasants may have to be sent home by force. 
</P>
<P>
The China Daily said Saturday that since an austerity program was started in 
September to bring an overheated economy under control, 81,000 rural firms had 
gone bankrupt and 30,000 others that are deep in debt have laid off hundreds of 
thousands of workers. It said many of the workers are unwilling to return to 
hard, poorly paid farm work. 
</P>
<P>
China does not release unemployment figures but newspapers have spoken of 20 
million to 30 million jobless and a similar number of "surplus workers" -- 
people with jobs that give them salaries but nothing to do.

BROKEN WRISTS, SICKNESS LED TO CONFESSION, HIJACK SUSPECT SAYS

Fawaz Younis, a Lebanese militiaman charged with hijacking in a case that tests 
recent U.S. anti-terrorism legislation, told jurors Monday that the pain of two 
broken wrists and seasickness led him to confess while without legal counsel to 
FBI agents who snared him in international waters off Cyprus. 
</P>
<P>
"I was placed in a very sensitive position," he said. "I did not know what 
would become of me." He said he was so sick that "I would do anything so 
(authorities would) leave me alone." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking through an interpreter, Younis described how an American doctor 
provided him only with ice for his broken and tightly manacled wrists until 
after he had signed his confession. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Events Before Skyjacking 
</P>
<P>
In riveting detail, he also outlined events leading to the 1985 skyjacking of 
Royal Jordanian Flight 402 in Beirut, Lebanon. He described how, in the midst 
of clashes between Shiite and Palestinian gunmen in Beirut, he was summoned by 
a commander of Lebanon's Amal Shiite militia and told that he would hijack a 
plane the next day. 
</P>
<P>
The defense's case rests largely on evidence that Younis followed what he 
thought were legitimate military orders from superiors who are recognized 
political and military officials. Amal is headed by Lebanese Justice Minister 
Nabih Berri. As Younis and earlier prosecution witnesses testified, Amal also 
works in West Beirut alongside the Lebanese Army in protecting key facilities, 
such as the airport and American University of Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
On June 10, Younis said, he was ordered by Amal military commander Akel Hamiyeh 
to hijack a plane to Tunis, where Arab League foreign ministers were to meet 
the next day to debate the Shiite-Palestinian fighting. While he and four 
others were held incommunicado overnight, Younis was handed a statement to be 
read on arrival in Tunis, demanding the Palestinians' removal from Lebanon 
because the Amal feared that the presence of Palestine Liberation Organization 
guerrillas might provoke strikes by neighboring Israel. 
</P>
<P>
He testified that he was chosen to head the mission because: "I always carried 
out any military order given to me without exception. They trusted me not to 
harm civilians." 
</P>
<P>
Asked by Francis D. Carter, his court-appointed defense attorney, what would 
happen to him if he had refused, Younis told of another Amal member who was 
shot through both legs for turning down an assignment. Judge Aubrey Robinson 
Jr. interjected to ask what assignment Younis meant. "To participate in the 
fighting," Younis replied. 
</P>
<P>
He said he did not pick the jet to be hijacked. "It was selected by the 
military commander. It was the only plane taking off in the morning . . . so it 
would get to Tunis before the meeting started." 
</P>
<P>
Carter has sought to portray Younis as a victim of Lebanon's 14 years of civil 
strife. Younis told how his 2- and 5-year-old sons are named for brothers 
killed in sectarian fighting. He will be cross-examined today in the case, 
which is expected to go to the jury this week.

BUSH VOWS MILITARY USE IN WAR ON DRUGS 
</P>

President Bush Monday pledged to use the nation's military forces in his war on 
drugs, telling a Veterans of Foreign Wars audience that illegal narcotics are 
"a threat no less real than the adversaries you have battled" in the nation's 
declared wars. 
</P>
<P>
The President's remarks came a week after a congressional study team 
recommended that the Administration consider dispatching U.S. Special Forces to 
Peru and Bolivia to conduct drug raids there. 
</P>
<P>
Bush did not comment directly on that proposal, but said: "I mean to mobilize 
all our resources, wage this war on all fronts. We're going to combat drug 
abuse with education, treatment, enforcement and, yes, interdiction -- and, 
yes, with our nation's armed services." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Growing Speculation 
</P>
<P>
Specifically how the Administration will attack the drug problem has been the 
subject of growing speculation in government. Bush's designated "drug czar," 
William J. Bennett, has six months to outline his plan, and so far has been 
reluctant to sketch out possible initiatives until he completes his research on 
the problem and available resources. 
</P>
<P>
Front-line use of the Pentagon's forces in the anti-drug effort has been the 
focus of particular controversy. Congress last year directed the military to 
get more involved in drug interdiction but its possible participation in raids 
in Latin America has raised serious concerns about U.S. interference with other 
nations' sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
Bush told the VFW officials, meeting at a conference here, that he would 
consider using military forces to intercept U.S.-bound drug shipments "when 
that prudently can be done and when that's what it takes" to disrupt 
trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to have to go all out," he said. "We need to break the deadly 
grip of drugs and prevent the drug source from taking hold." 
</P>
<P>
As the President spoke, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh and John C. Lawn, 
administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, were traveling to Bolivia 
for meetings with government leaders and justice ministers there and in Peru 
and Colombia. They are due back in Washington Thursday night and are to report 
to Bush Friday on Latin American efforts to counter the drug export business in 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was expected to continue to focus attention on the anti-drug campaign on a 
trip today to Delaware and Pennsylvania, but the trip was canceled because of 
bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
"The notion that America is a nation at peace is only partly true, as long as 
the violence and destructive power of drugs assault our communities," Bush 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He told the 2.3-million-member veterans organization: "You've fought for your 
nation once, and your nation needs you again. I want to enlist you in the 
anti-drug campaign. Meet with other leaders in your community -- church, 
clergy, law enforcement officers. Go to the schools . . . speak to your state 
and local elected officials. Urge them to make the passage of strong anti-drug 
legislation a priority." 
</P>
<P>
In directly attacking drug smuggling and production abroad, the DEA has been 
responsible for most major investigations and raids. The military has had a 
limited role in the drug war, including the deployment of Navy anti-submarine 
warfare aircraft over the Caribbean to spot suspicious vessels and relay 
information to patrolling civilian agents. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, U.S. Army helicopters have been used to carry Bolivian troops into 
the jungle to destroy laboratories that turn coca leaves into cocaine.

BUSH 'OUT OF IDEAS,' KENNEDY SAYS IN SHARP ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush has "run out of ideas" and has no foreign or domestic policy 
agenda for governing the nation, which will result in either "a period of half 
measures or at worst a time of deadlock and indecision," Sen. Edward M. Kennedy 
(D-Mass.) charged Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But, in making one of the sharpest attacks yet on the 6-week-old Bush 
Administration by a leading Democrat, Kennedy also criticized Massachusetts 
Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, his party's 1988 presidential nominee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cites Dukakis Failures 
</P>
<P>
Dukakis lost to Bush primarily because he failed to deliver a "compelling 
Democratic message" and allowed Republicans' negative attacks to fill the 
campaign vacuum, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, who is often called one of the Senate's most liberal members, said 
that former President Ronald Reagan was a more effective chief executive than 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy avoided Democratic leaders' recent professions of bipartisanship and 
cooperation with the White House in criticizing Bush, saying: "The President's 
poll ratings are still high, but, underneath, the erosion is already setting 
in." 
</P>
<P>
In referring to Bush's troubled nomination of John Tower as defense secretary, 
he said: "The problem is not just the Tower disaster or the Administration's 
unprecedented failure to fill most of the top posts in government. That failure 
only reflects a deeper weakness." 
</P>
<P>
He asserted that the President and the GOP "have run out of ideas" and argued 
that the Administration "has no agenda, other than coping, no real budget, no 
major initiatives and very little to say about what George Bush calls 'the 
vision thing.' " That situation, Kennedy predicted, will produce a "time of 
deadlock and indecision." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees Danger for Party 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "for Democrats, it represents both a danger and an opportunity 
-- a danger, because with it comes the temptation to do nothing except 
criticize, while waiting for the Bush presidency to falter. In my view, that is 
both wrong in principle and bad politics. We dare not forget the lesson of last 
year: George Bush was supposed to be easy to beat. . . . I hope Democrats never 
again fall into that trap." 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats do, however, have an opportunity now to outline a new path for 
the 1990s and beyond to accommodate changing realities and enduring ideals, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Across a range of concerns where the Administration seems frozen in the ice of 
its own intellectual emptiness, the creative initiative will pass over to the 
Democratic Party if we choose to take it," he said. "As Democrats, we have to 
transcend the narrow choice between bigger deficits and lesser programs, 
between throwing money at problems and throwing up our hands in helpless 
indifference, between standing still and raising taxes." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to Bush, Reagan was an effective President because he stood for a 
set of ideas, which he stated in 1980, then "wrote most of them not only into 
public law but into the national consciousness," Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Speaks at Yale 
</P>
<P>
But the GOP cannot live off Reagan's legacy any more than Democrats can succeed 
by simply repeating Franklin D. Roosevelt or John F. Kennedy, he told students 
at Yale University, Bush's alma mater, where Kennedy, a Harvard alumnus, spoke 
as part of the annual Chubb Fellowship program. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the ideas -- now we have to muster the will to stand for them and run 
on them," he said. "If we do that -- then, in 1992, we can succeed in removing 
a Yale President from the White House -- even if we don't succeed in replacing 
him with someone from Harvard."

A January accident at a nuclear weapons reactor in South Carolina may have 
resulted in significantly more damage than engineers initially believed, a 
newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
An Energy Department investigation of the Jan. 22 accident at the Savannah 
River plant, during which pressurized water in a reactor cooling system shook 
pipes and caused some valves to break, found that two 95-ton heat exchangers 
may have been ruined, the New York Times reported, quoting government 
engineers. 
</P>
<P>
The Energy Department is further examining the heat exchangers to determine 
whether they need to be replaced, the paper said. "We have seen an elevation of 
tritium levels in the exchangers," said John Patterson, the department's 
assistant manager for reactor operations at Savannah River. "We'll know within 
a month whether we'll have to replace them." 
</P>
<P>
The exchangers transfer heat from the primary system for cooling the reactor to 
the secondary cooling system. Following the January accident, technicians found 
that the secondary cooling system's water contained levels of radioactive 
tritium that were hundreds of times higher than normal, indicating leaks inside 
the exchangers.

26 AIRLINES FINED $1.18 MILLION FOR SECURITY LAPSES

<P>
The government Monday announced fines against 26 airlines totaling $1.18 
million for failure to detect fake weapons smuggled past security systems, but 
officials said detection has improved markedly over the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
Airlines cited by the Federal Aviation Administration allegedly failed in 156 
instances to detect simulated guns, knives, explosives or other fake weapons 
taken through airport screening points during 1988 by federal agents. 
</P>
<P>
The detection rate for all airlines checked was 93.1%, the FAA said, compared 
to 88.2% in a July, 1988, report and 78.9% in a 1987 test. 
</P>
<P>
FAA fines for security lapses have totaled nearly $4 million since the program 
began two years ago, the FAA said. About 50 airlines have been cited for 557 
detection failures. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said it ran more than 6,800 checks of airline security systems 
during 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Under FAA rules, airlines are responsible for screening passengers and their 
carry-on luggage. 
</P>
<P>
The largest fines were $186,000 against American Airlines for 24 alleged 
violations, $151,000 against Continental Airlines for 20, $136,000 against 
Eastern for 18 and $132,000 against USAir for 15. Other fines ranged from 
$1,000 for single violations to $92,000.

UPROAR 'ROUND THE FLAG: EXHIBIT AT CALARTS SPARKS DISPUTE, THEFT 
</P>

Two unidentified men walked into the California Institute of the Arts in 
Valencia late Monday afternoon and snatched an American flag from a student 
exhibit that has become the center of growing anger and argument and turned it 
over to authorities at a nearby sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the theft, a small contingent of members from American Legion 
Post 507 in Newhall arrived at the avant-garde school to peacefully protest the 
exhibit, which featured the flag tacked to the floor. It is similar to a 
display that has caused a stir in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sad state of affairs," Adam Greene, the fourth-year student who created 
the work, said of the theft. "It is, at its best, inane." 
</P>
<P>
The legionnaire demonstrators did not immediately claim responsibility for the 
theft. However, earlier in the day, representatives of the group had promised 
they would steal the flag. 
</P>
<P>
"We have members who say they will go up there, rip the flag off the ground, 
properly fold it and show up at the sheriff's station and say, 'Yes, we stole 
it,' " post Cmdr. Armie Trujillo said prior to the theft. 
</P>
<P>
"Some good, red-blooded young men picked up the flag and brought it into the 
station, saying it was being displayed in violation of the law," said Sheriff's 
Sgt. Carle Goyan of the Santa Clarita station. 
</P>
<P>
Goyan said the men told sheriff's deputies that they left a note at the exhibit 
saying, "They had committed this terrible deed and . . . if they wanted it 
back, they would have to come (to the sheriff's station) and get it . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Deputies placed the flag in evidence, took statements from both men and 
released them, pending a complaint being filed by either artist Greene or the 
school, another sheriff's spokesman said. Deputies declined to comment on the 
identities of the men. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drew Visit 
</P>
<P>
Greene's exhibit has drawn sharp criticism from residents of surrounding 
communities and from people within the school. Earlier Monday, it also drew a 
visit from sheriff's deputies, who told school officials that the display could 
be in violation of state and federal laws, said John Orders, assistant to the 
CalArts' president. 
</P>
<P>
CalArts officials vowed to support the artwork but also posted a sign beside it 
warning, "The administration has been advised that it may be unlawful to step 
upon or trample the American flag." 
</P>
<P>
Greene intended that his artwork be a show of support for artist Scott Tyler, 
whose similar piece has been making national news at the School of the Art 
Institute of Chicago. Tyler's "What Is the Proper Way to Display the American 
Flag?" includes a flag draped on the floor and a ledger for comments. For all 
but the most nimble, it is necessary to step on the flag to write in the 
ledger. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 200 veterans demonstrated at the Chicago institute, and school 
officials temporarily closed the exhibit. A Cook County circuit judge Friday 
dismissed a suit filed by veterans, and the exhibit was reopened. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, a visiting Virginia teacher who stepped on the flag was arrested in 
Chicago and charged with desecration of the flag, a felony that carries a 
maximum sentence of three years in prison and a $10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Greene, who learned of the Chicago exhibit through newspaper and television 
reports, opened his exhibit last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Artists have to stand up for each other. If we don't, who will?" Greene, 28, 
said. "This piece is not about a cold, anti-American feeling. It's very 
important that it is seen as being against censorship." 
</P>
<P>
Greene's piece is smaller than the original, and his ledger book is more easily 
accessible without stepping on the flag. 
</P>
<P>
"I see it as a pro-American piece," Greene said. "It stands for civil rights, 
for the idea that we can say anything." 
</P>
<P>
Serious opposition to Greene's work formed quickly on campus. By Friday 
afternoon, about 50 staff members mounted a counter-exhibit with a flag flying 
from a potted plant. 
</P>
<P>
"We find the flag exhibit offensive and disrespectful and wish it known that we 
DO NOT SUPPORT IT!!!" their exhibit stated. 
</P>
<P>
By Saturday morning, as word of Greene's flag exhibit spread, the school began 
receiving angry phone calls from the community. 
</P>
<P>
John Berlin, a music student who works on the school's switchboard, said the 
exhibit has triggered "a lot of threats, a lot of anger around this school." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of Monday's visit, the Sheriff's Department will make a report to 
the district attorney's office, which will decide whether the exhibit is in 
violation of the law. 
</P>
<P>
No exhibit has ever been censored at CalArts, administrators said. The form 
that students fill out to request display space does not ask for a description 
of the work. 
</P>
<P>
"We consider free speech and the open exploration of ideas to be central not 
only to the production of art but to the well-being of a free society," Orders 
said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
He later added, "Controversy is what an art school is about, right?" 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, students offered responses to the work ranging from approval to 
anger to indifference. Four joined with the legionnaires' pickets and later 
taped protest placards near Greene's display. 
</P>
<P>
Comments in Greene's ledger were similarly mixed: 
</P>
<P>
"This is stupid, pointless and childish. Don't you have enough talent to do 
something good?" 
</P>
<P>
"The proper way to display a U.S. flag is in the closet, until it really stands 
for something." 
</P>
<P>
"Good work." 
</P>
<P>
"SHAME!" 
</P>
<P>
Protesting legionnaires, who promised to return if Greene restores the flag, 
offered harsher words. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm all for the First Amendment. Hell, I fought for it," said Billy Pappas, 
40, a Vietnam veteran from Newhall. "But putting the flag on the floor is not 
art. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry if I offended anyone," Greene said of his exhibit, which is 
scheduled to close Friday. "But if standing up for free speech offends someone, 
then it has to be."

The FBI and Los Angeles police Monday announced the arrest of 33 suspects in 
their first joint operation to crack down on drug trafficking by Los Angeles 
gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the suspects, however, escaped from jail during the weekend. Police 
Chief Daryl F. Gates described the men as dangerous "hard-core career 
criminals." 
</P>
<P>
The arrests came during two raids last week in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Lawler, special agent in charge of the FBI for Los Angeles, said his 
agency and the police decided six months ago to unite against Los Angeles gangs 
because they were exporting crime -- especially drugs -- to other cities. 
</P>
<P>
"When we saw it start to spread across the country . . . then it becomes a 
national problem," Lawler said. "This is just the beginning of a long series of 
investigations and arrests that we hope will have a great impact." 
</P>
<P>
Nine of those arrested are being held on federal drug charges. However, none is 
being specifically connected to an interstate drug operation. 
</P>
<P>
And Lawler acknowledged that the amount of drugs seized -- about two pounds of 
rock cocaine -- was small. But he said several of the people arrested were 
"above street level" and played a significant role in the drug trade. 
</P>
<P>
By holding the nine suspects on federal charges, they face longer, mandatory 
prison 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weapons, Drugs Shown 
</P>
<P>
Gates, Lawler and other officials announced the arrests at a news conference at 
police headquarters. Police displayed the guns and cocaine that agents 
recovered in the raids. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. J.J. May, who made several of the arrests, told about paging one suspect 
on a beeper to persuade him to turn himself in. At another location, May said, 
as he approached to make the arrest he could hear the gang suspects listening 
to a police scanner transmitting the raiding agents' conversations. 
</P>
<P>
Officials had planned the press conference, however, before they knew of the 
escapes. 
</P>
<P>
The two men who fled were identified as Buford Bates, 24, and Eric Wright, 18. 
They were arrested along with 11 other suspects Friday during simultaneous 
raids by the FBI, anti-gang police detectives and agents from the Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Seventeen guns were seized and the 11 suspects 
were booked on charges including perjury, weapons possession and parole 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
Bates and Wright are suspected of stealing 11 guns, including a MAC-11 assault 
weapon, from a man they allegedly kidnaped on Jan. 30. They were booked on 
kidnaping and robbery charges Friday but disappeared from the 77th Street 
Station during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Gates blamed the escape on overcrowding. The jail, he said, is so crowded that 
inmates are fed in the hallways; it has room for 15 people but housed 45 felons 
over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that the escape is embarrassing and that it is under 
investigation. Bates and Wright were discovered missing Monday morning as 
police prepared for the press conference. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Offers No Excuse 
</P>
<P>
"There is no excuse for losing prisoners of this magnitude," he said. "These 
are people who need to go to jail for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
In the other raid, 20 people were arrested on Wednesday when federal and local 
agents converged on 11 locations in a 10-block area of South-Central Los 
Angeles, Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
Nine were held on federal counts of selling narcotics and transferred to 
federal custody. The 11 others were booked on drug and misdemeanor charges. 
</P>
<P>
Two pounds of rock cocaine and three guns were also confiscated. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the people arrested belong to the 46th Street Hustlers, a subset of the 
Crips gang, police said.

TOP BRADLEY VOTE FUND SUPPORTERS REWARDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY, Times City-County Bureau 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley reported Monday that his reelection campaign 
committee has spent $13,300 for limousine service, $11,837 for flowers and 
about $44,000 at a Manhattan hotel and expensive Los Angeles restaurants, all 
as part of its fund-raising effort. 
</P>
<P>
The spending, according to campaign spokeswoman DeeDee Meyers, went for food 
and entertainment for campaign contributors and for a trip to New York that was 
offered as a prize for top fund raisers in a campaign Bradley is expected to 
win easily. 
</P>
<P>
His best financed opponent, Los Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden, in 
contrast, said his entire spending for this year has been $41,454, most of it 
going for the purchase of semiautomatic assault rifles he had offered to buy 
from residents in an effort to get the weapons off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cover Two Months 
</P>
<P>
The campaign reports, submitted to the city clerk, cover the first two months 
of this year and showed Bradley had received $192,165 in that period, and spent 
$314,004. That left him with a balance of $1,697,370, counting what he had 
collected previously. 
</P>
<P>
Holden, after spending $41,454, had just $162,872 in the bank. The other 
well-known mayoral contender, former Los Angeles County Supervisor Baxter Ward, 
is not accepting campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Seven others also are running for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
The figures in the reports were strong evidence of the one-sidedness of the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has deployed a small-scale political army against his under-financed 
foes. Meyers said the expenditures had been planned when Bradley thought he 
would be opposed by City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky. But the mechanism remained 
in place even after Yaroslavsky decided not to run. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Computers Rented 
</P>
<P>
The mayor has rented computers, hired a computer consultant, employed expensive 
campaign managers and even paid $30,000 to a polling firm, which told him he 
would win. 
</P>
<P>
For food, room rentals, transportation and decorations for fund-raising events 
in Manhattan and Los Angeles, Bradley reported: $13,712 to the Regency Hotel on 
Park Avenue, $13,300 to Manhattan Limousines, $11,837 to Atlas Floral 
Decorations of New York, $19,860 to Chasen's, $5,000 to Ambrosia Catering of 
Santa Monica, $2,121 to The Regency Club of Westwood and $2,807 to the Friars' 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
Meyers said the New York trip was a prize for supporters who raised at least 
$25,000 each for Bradley's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The trip took place in November, during an intense period of fund-raising 
before Yaroslavsky's withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
The supporters were flown to New York, put up at the Regency, taken around the 
city in limousines and entertained. Although bills for the trip were high, the 
contributors had brought in about $500,000, Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
The reports showed campaign manager Christopher Humes received $28,000 and his 
assistant, Chris Hammong, $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
The polling firm of Fairbank, Bregman &amp; Maullin received $30,000 for a poll 
that Meyers said was taken in December, when Yaroslavsky was still in the race. 
</P>
<P>
Committee Communication, got $5,291 for printing dinner invitations and $11,249 
was paid to rent a computer system from Practical Systems Inc.

STUDENT, 15, STABS HIS TEACHER IN THE BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A ninth-grade student at a Sylmar junior high school stabbed his teacher in the 
back Monday while being disciplined in class for using profanity, Los Angeles 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
The Olive Vista Junior High teacher, 37-year-old Cynthia Edwards of Palmdale, 
was in stable condition after a three-inch knife blade, embedded to the hilt in 
the back of her shoulder, was removed at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission 
Hills, hospital officials said. No vital organs were damaged, they added. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old, ninth-grade student had a history of troubles with Edwards and 
other teachers and had been transferred to Olive Vista because of disciplinary 
problems, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
He surrendered to school administrators shortly after the stabbing at 1:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assault With Deadly Weapon 
</P>
<P>
Police said the Pacoima youth will be held at the Sylmar Juvenile Hall, where 
he was booked for investigation of assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Bernard D. Conine said Edwards called the teen-ager to the front of the 
classroom because he had disrupted the English class of about 25 students. 
</P>
<P>
"He used profanity," Conine said. "She was writing him up. When the teacher 
turned away she was stabbed in the back." 
</P>
<P>
A classmate who asked not to be identified said she believed that the student 
had not completed an assignment and became abusive when Edwards chastised him. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards was sitting at her desk when the boy walked up and stood behind her, 
the witness said. Moments later, Edwards cried out, "He hit me!" and then 
realized that she had been stabbed. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so strange," said the student, who did not see the actual attack. "This 
is not a bad school. But this is hard to believe." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ran From Class 
</P>
<P>
Many of the students panicked and ran from the classroom yelling that their 
teacher had been stabbed, officials said. A teacher from an adjacent classroom 
ran in and, along with other students, comforted Edwards, who lay on the floor 
until an ambulance arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids were pretty good," Assistant Principal Linda Hosford said. "They were 
naturally upset. But they tried to take care of her." 
</P>
<P>
School officials made a general announcement to the faculty and student body 
about the incident, and classes at the school at 14600 Tyler St. resumed. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they will offer counseling today to any student who requests 
such help. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards has been at Olive Vista for one year. School officials said she taught 
elsewhere in the Los Angeles Unified School District for years, but further 
details were not available. 
</P>
<P>
District officials described her as a well-respected, veteran instructor. 
</P>
<P>
At the time she was stabbed, Edwards was writing a "referral" for the student, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Common Disciplinary Action 
</P>
<P>
School officials said a referral is a common disciplinary action in which a 
student who is disruptive in class is sent to the school's referral room for 
the remainder of the class. In the referral room, the student is monitored by 
another teacher. When the next class period begins, the student can return to 
his normal schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Schools Supt. Gabe Cortina said a referral is "pretty minor" and he 
was surprised by the student's response. 
</P>
<P>
"It is rather bizarre behavior," Cortina said. 
</P>
<P>
Cortina said he did not know when the student had transferred to Olive Vista 
and would not reveal the name of his former school or what problems, if any, he 
might have had there. 
</P>
<P>
School officials said the boy previously had been disciplined and counseled by 
Edwards because of behavioral problems. 
</P>
<P>
Cortina said the boy also had "family problems," but would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lot of Problems' 
</P>
<P>
"He's had a lot of problems with maturity and focusing on class," Cortina said. 
"But there was never anything this serious before." 
</P>
<P>
School officials and police said the student had no known gang affiliation. 
They said that while it was unknown how long he had been carrying the weapon on 
campus, he had never been caught with a weapon before. 
</P>
<P>
Several students who know the youth described him as a friendly boy who did not 
like class work, but enjoyed sports, particularly basketball. Most expressed 
shock upon learning that he was accused of stabbing a teacher or that he even 
carried a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
"He always seemed real cool, like a normal kid," said Mario Alcazar, 14. "He'd 
get mad at teachers, but you don't stab them." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Principal John McLaughlin said Olive Vista has a good safety record 
for both students and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a safe place, it's a Valley school," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weapons Rarely Found 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they could not speculate on how many students in the school of 
1,600 might carry weapons on campus. Though records on how many weapons have 
been seized at the school were not immediately available, officials said 
weapons are rarely found on the campus. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't systematically search kids every single day," Cortina said. "We try 
to be alert. This is generally a very safe campus. This is an exception." 
</P>
<P>
On May 3, 1988, two Olive Vista students were shot near the school and 
seriously injured. In that incident two gang members, who did not attend the 
school, drove by the school and fired a gun into a crowd of students walking 
home after classes. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, as reporters and camera crews moved down the hallways after the 
school day ended, some students worried that the two incidents will give Olive 
Vista an undeserved black eye. 
</P>
<P>
"People are going to look at the shooting and stabbing and think this is a bad 
school," one student said to a friend. "But it's not."

TV NEWS FOR TEENS GETS RAVE REVIEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Teachers and students reacted enthusiastically Monday to the debut of a 
commercial daily television news program for teen-agers at Gahr High School in 
Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
Whittle Communications provided 91 television monitors, a satellite dish and 
videocassette recorder to the school as part of a nationwide test of "Channel 
One," a 12-minute news program. The five-week pilot program also is being 
tested at high schools in Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
After the show began with flashy graphics, two youthful anchors read headlines 
illustrated with film footage about the Eastern Airlines strike, the battle 
over John Tower's nomination as secretary of defense and the life of Soviet 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
"The production was outstanding. It was as good as any of the network 
broadcasts," Principal Nadine Barreto said. 
</P>
<P>
Kristi McNally, 15, said she liked the program because it gave her a chance to 
see news she cannot see at home. "I think it's pretty neat we can watch in our 
classrooms," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's broadcast included two minutes of commercials for candy bars, jeans 
and a dandruff shampoo, Barreto said. Groups such as the National 
Parent-Teacher Assn. and the National Assn. of Secondary School Principals have 
opposed the program because it includes commercials.

In a ceremony punctuated by bagpipe music and blue skies, a state parks agency 
turned over 2,434 acres in the Santa Monica Mountains to the National Park 
Service Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The cornerstone of the $11-million land sale by the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy was the site of the ceremony, the 1,655-acre Circle X Ranch in 
southeast Ventura County, which includes Sandstone Peak, the highest point in

POSTSCRIPT: 'I THINK MOST SCIENTISTS IN THE FIELD WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHETHER 
THE THING REALLY EXISTED.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Concern and even apprehension was expressed 13 years ago when scientists said 
they had detected a huge bulge in the Earth's crust centered near Palmdale and 
that it might be the precursor of a giant earthquake in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The Palmdale Bulge was eventually said to have developed during the early 1960s 
and to have uplifted an area extending along the San Andreas Fault from Point 
Arguello southeastward to the Salton Sea, but to have had the most effect in 
the Palmdale area, where the uplift was supposedly about 10 inches. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dispute Faded 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, following years of dispute as to whether there actually was a 
bulge, the phenomenon has faded from public attention. Federal research grants 
have mostly dried up, and even those who believe the most in the bulge say they 
doubt whether it could say much about where and when a big earthquake may 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
"I think most scientists in the field would like to know whether the thing 
really existed," said Thomas Heaton of the U.S. Geological Survey's Pasadena 
office. "If it did, I'm not sure whether it would have predictive value. I'm 
not sure we understand it well enough yet. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly it's an interesting notion to think large-scale changes in the 
Earth's crust are occurring. But it's kind of hard to say too much when the 
interpretation of the data is so ambiguous." 
</P>
<P>
The greatest public defender of the bulge remains Robert Castle of the 
Geological Survey's Menlo Park office, who says he is sure there was one, part 
of which has now collapsed, but that what research efforts are still going on 
are devoted more to explaining the phenomenon than charting any rise or fall of 
terrain. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not been generating any new data," said Castle, "just using what 
exists in historic record." But asked whether the bulge would be of value in 
predicting an earthquake, Castle said, "I really don't know. If I read my 
entrails correctly, I'd say limited at best." 
</P>
<P>
"It's great when we can find something to agree on," responded David Jackson, 
the UCLA geologist who, beginning in 1979 and continuing for years thereafter, 
sharply questioned whether there was a bulge at all. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Predictions 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't found anything in all the measurements we've taken that has led to 
earthquake predictions, or has taught us about earthquakes." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said there has been a recent study that shows "no rapid ups and downs" 
such as Castle and others say have occurred, but just "a very small, steady 
rise, just barely measurable, not any bulging or debulging." 
</P>
<P>
The effort to find a means of predicting earthquakes, in the meantime, has gone 
on to other concentrations. The latest is a theory that moderate earthquakes on 
smaller faults may trigger within hours the "big one" on the San Andreas.

JUDGE RAPS CITY CLERK, PUTS ACTIVIST ON BALLOT; 
</P>
<P>
APPROVES CANDIDACY IN COUNCIL RACE AFTER STUDYING DISPUTED SIGNATURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge, criticizing the Los Angeles city clerk's office for its 
handling of signatures on nominating petitions, on Monday ordered the clerk to 
add activist Bennett Kayser's name to the April 11 municipal primary ballot. 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing dozens of disputed signatures, Judge Kurt J. Lewin ruled that 
Kayser qualified for the ballot with 493 valid signatures instead of the 
required 500 signatures. That is because the clerk's office erred by 
distributing an incorrect map of the 13th Council District's boundaries. 
"Four-hundred-ninety-three is enough," the judge said. "We can get on with the 
election." 
</P>
<P>
The effect of Kayser's entry into the race, where three other, largely unknown 
challengers are trying to unseat Councilman Michael Woo, is unclear. In 1985, 
the year that Woo beat then-incumbent Peggy Stevenson, Kayser also ran and 
finished fifth in the primary with about 1% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Atty. Anthony Saul Alperin agreed that "the map is in error" but 
objected to the court's reviewing the city clerk's determination about the 
validity of voter signatures. Alperin had no comment on the judge's decision 
but said the city will not appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Alperin had said that Kayser's court case seeking a place on the 
ballot was costing the taxpayers thousands of dollars by delaying the printing 
of sample ballots. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Kayser said their client, relying on the erroneous map supplied 
by the clerk, collected signatures of at least nine registered voters who live 
inside the boundaries shown on the map but actually do not live in the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Kayser, a former president of the influential Federation of Hillside and Canyon 
Assns., said of the ruling: "I can stop worrying about voter signatures and 
begin the campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Charging that Woo has been unresponsive to community concerns about growth and 
traffic problems in the district, which includes Hollywood, Los Feliz and parts 
of Sherman Oaks, Silver Lake and Echo Park, Kayser now has another cause: 
election reform. 
</P>
<P>
He said it is unfair that City Council candidates in Los Angeles must collect 
the signatures of 500 registered voters while it takes only 40 to 60 signatures 
to run for the Legislature and just 65 to 100 signatures to run for governor or 
the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
In his ruling, the judge criticized Kayser for being lax and showing "very poor 
planning" by submitting only 598 signatures and not bringing suit earlier. 
</P>
<P>
But the judge took aim at the clerk's office for "an error in judgment" in not 
accepting signatures ultimately found to be valid on Kayser's nominating 
petitions. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the clerk's office had held that only 401 of the 598 signatures on 
Kayser's petitions were valid. 
</P>
<P>
In a review of contested signatures that lasted much of the day, the judge 
overturned the city's decision to invalidate signatures in cases where women 
had married and changed their names but not their voter registration, where a 
voter listed his or her address as a post office box, and where the date signed 
by a voter on the petition was incorrect.

U.S. District Judge John Sprizzo in Manhattan granted defense motions to drop 
conspiracy charges against seven of the 14 defendants in the "Pizza Connection 
II" drug conspiracy trial. His ruling meant five of the defendants walked free, 
while other charges remained against the two others. The defendants were 
accused of participating in an international ring smuggling heroin and cocaine 
that was tied to the 1987 "Pizza Connection" trial that convicted 17 of 18 
defendants, all members or associates of the Mafia in the United States and 
Italy. The judge said he took the action against defendants who were not aware 
of what others were doing in the alleged ring.

2 DIE IN SCOTTISH RAIL CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Two people were killed and 44 injured when two commuter trains collided head-on 
in Britain's second fatal rail crash in three days. Scotrail, a branch of the 
state-owned British Rail, said the trains were traveling at less than 30 m.p.h. 
in opposite directions when they collided outside Bellgrove Station in Glasgow. 
At least two cars of the trains, carrying about 70 passengers, derailed. The 
cause of the accident was not immediately known. A crash Saturday on the 
outskirts of London killed five people and injured 94. Last Dec. 12, three 
trains crashed near a busy south London junction during rush hour, killing 35 
people. That accident was blamed on a signal failure.

More than 1,000 Howard University students in Washington took over the school's 
administration building in an effort to force the removal of Lee Atwater, 
chairman of the Republican National Committee, from Howard's board of trustees. 
Leaders of the protest at Howard, one of the nation's largest black colleges, 
vowed that they would retain control of the building until Atwater, whom they 
described as having "consistently opposed the agenda of African-American 
people," is removed from the board. The action followed a demonstration Friday 
by about 2,000 students who disrupted Howard's 122nd anniversary convocation 
ceremony as they protested Atwater's election to the board. There were reports 
that classes in two study halls and in the school of business were shut down, 
or were being heavily boycotted. But Alan Hermesch, director of university 
relations, said that the institution was "operating normally" except for the 
administration building.

The shuttle Discovery's launch from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, now 
planned for Saturday, could be delayed up to two days because of a faulty 
electrical component that must be replaced, officials said. The problem 
involves a "master events controller," or MEC, that failed a routine test 
Sunday night. The component is one of two such devices that control when the 
shuttle's boosters and external tank separate during launch.

Venezuela lifted a nationwide curfew but kept martial law in effect in the wake 
of several days of price riots that claimed 247 lives by official count and 
injured nearly 2,000. The curfew had been imposed Feb. 28, a day after riots 
and looting erupted when authorities announced steep price boosts for transport 
fares, gasoline and some basic food items. Primary schools and kindergartens 
resumed classes, and secondary schools are expected to reopen this week. It was 
unclear when universities -- traditionally a center of protest in Venezuela -- 
will resume classes. Under martial law, soldiers can search houses without 
warrants and detain suspects without charge.

Hundreds of impoverished Haitians seized boats over the weekend in an effort to 
get to the United States after a rumored easing of U.S. immigration policies, a 
Port-au-Prince radio station reported. The independent station Radio Metropole 
said at least five cases of piracy were reported after people tried to seize 
sailboats and small cargo ships in the harbors of Port-au-Prince, Petit Goave, 
Les Cayes and Jeremie. It said one body washed ashore after a commandeered boat 
foundered on a reef and that craft carrying 183 Haitians were stopped at sea by 
the U.S. Coast Guard.

A U.S.-Laos search for American servicemen missing in Indochina has been 
postponed because Laos objected to a U.S. report on the international drug 
trade, the State Department said. Spokesman Charles Redman said that the fifth 
joint excavation had been scheduled to start last Saturday and that "we regret 
that the Lao government has temporarily postponed plans." In the report that 
apparently offended Laos, President Bush last week added Laos and Burma to the 
list of major drug producing or trafficking nations that are not qualified to 
receive U.S. economic aid or support in getting loans from multilateral lending 
agencies.

The son of a man and woman who died of multiple stab wounds was arrested for 
investigation of murder as he tried to ride away from the family's San Luis 
Obispo home on a bicycle, even though the house was surrounded by police 
officers, authorities said. Ronald Wade McClave's parents, Larry McClave, 49, 
and Helen McClave, 47, were found dead or dying when officers arrived at the 
home, Capt. Bart Topham said. Police gave no motive for the slayings. The 
younger McClave, 24, lived with his parents. Larry McClave was a member of the 
San Luis Obispo Architectural Review Commission and was employed by the county.

GREENPEACE SCORES A POP 'BREAKTHROUGH' IN MOSCOW

They didn't look like Russians. Several wore bowler hats, two had their hair in 
Rasta dreadlocks, and all looked distinctly Western, as only being in the 
Soviet Union can make you look. But just who they were eluded most of the 
Russian pedestrians going about their business in Red Square at 10 a.m. Monday 
when rock stars like Annie Lennox of Eurythmics, Peter Gabriel, Chrissie Hynde 
of the Pretenders, and Tom and Alannah Currie of the Thompson Twins -- in town 
to launch an album to raise money for the international environmental group 
Greenpeace -- went for a stroll. 
</P>
<P>
What happened? "Nothing," admitted one organizer. Did anyone recognize them? 
"Well a few looked." 
</P>
<P>
Half an hour later, however, a dozen of the Western rockers found themselves 
facing thousands of fans who had lined up from the early hours of the morning 
for a chance to buy the album and have it autographed. 
</P>
<P>
The album, launched under the name "Breakthrough" features music by 25 groups 
and individuals who donated their music to help raise money for Greenpeace. 
Other artists on the record include Sting, Bryan Ferry, the Grateful Dead, 
INXS, Simple Minds, R.E.M., Sade and Dire Straits. 
</P>
<P>
At one outlet of the state-run Melodiya record company only about a mile from 
the Kremlin, about 3,000 fans, pushing for position, had already broken a 
window before the musicians even arrived. All three of the Melodiya stores 
where the guest artists were due to appear had sold out of the initial 2,800 
albums they received well before closing. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual bit of promotion, viewers had been treated to a commercial 
promoting the album on Soviet television for several days earlier. In addition, 
stars like David Byrne of Talking Heads and U2's the Edge did interviews with 
Soviet television and radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
As rare as a TV commercial is in the Soviet Union, press conferences to launch 
albums are even rarer. At Monday's "Breakthrough" press gathering, a spokesman 
for the Soviet record pressing company, also called Melodiya, told reporters, 
"Melodiya sells 120 million albums a year, but this is the first press 
conference we're having." 
</P>
<P>
Of the initial 500,000 albums from the promised 3 million records and 500,000 
cassette tapes to be sold on behalf of Greenpeace here, 160,000 were released 
to Melodiya outlets across the country Monday. Half of the expected earnings of 
8.6 million rubles (about $13.9 million) from the sale of the double albums, 
which are selling for 11 rubles (about $18), will be used to set up a 
Greenpeace office in Moscow and Greenpeace environmental projects in the 
U.S.S.R. 
</P>
<P>
The other half will be donated to an independent Moscow-based, East-West 
foundation called the International Foundation for the Survival and Development 
of Humanity. That foundation was recently set up to promote international 
scientific projects and public activities aimed at preventing nuclear war and 
preserving the environment. According to Greenpeace the foundation's membership 
includes some of the world's leading scientists, public servants and 
philosophers concerned about the future of the planet. 
</P>
<P>
One of the attractions of the album for Soviet youths is the chance to get 
quality recordings from Western rock groups most of them have only heard of, 
but never had the opportunity to buy their music. Because Melodiya has refused 
to pay royalties to musicians and contract holders in the past, most Western 
music has remained in the West. Occasionally, however, Melodiya has sold 
pirated versions of Western music, most commonly old Beatles albums. 
</P>
<P>
While musicians at Monday's press conference expressed delight at being part of 
the Greenpeace cause, both Peter Gabriel and Jerry Harrison of Talking Heads 
seemed surprised to see fans bringing copies of their albums to be signed. 
Neither knew their albums had been released in the U.S.S.R. Said Gabriel: "I'm 
sure my album has not been bootlegged. I'll be asking my record company about 
it tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
In answer to reporters' questions about why they had donated their music to 
Greenpeace, the pop stars said it was out of concern for the future. "I've just 
had a new baby," said Alannah Currie of Thompson Twins, "and I'm afraid for 
her." Gabriel and Karl Wallinger of World Party voiced the same concern for 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
Annie Lennox told reporters it was her first time in the Soviet Union, "and I'm 
thrilled to be here. The fact we've been given the freedom to do what we want 
while we've been here gives me a fantastic sense of progress for us. This is an 
historical occasion." 
</P>
<P>
Australian singer John Farnham said he asked kids in line at one of the stores 
why they were lining up. "We're here to see Peter Gabriel," they answered. "How 
long will you wait for him?" Farnham pressed. "As long as it takes," they 
replied, in true Soviet style. 
</P>
<P>
Though Greenpeace plans to open its office soon, it is currently working out of 
space in Moscow's Academy of Sciences. The Greenpeace album will be released 
elsewhere in the world April 24 under the name "Rainbow Warriors." It was 
released first in the Soviet Union to "celebrate" Greenpeace's move into the 
Soviet Union, officials said.

WONDER'S HUMANITY SHINES IN RIPERTON BENEFIT CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, Times Pop Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Isn't it strange how things sometimes work out? 
</P>
<P>
The lure of Stevie Wonder's benefit concert Sunday night at the Universal 
Amphitheatre was the opportunity to see the acclaimed pop figure performing 
here in a "small" hall with a band for the first time in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Wonder, who normally plays 16,000-seat arenas, did do a 1987 benefit at the 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, but he was accompanied that night by only his own 
pre-programmed computer. 
</P>
<P>
This time he was joined in the benefit, which raised an estimated $200,000 for 
the Minnie Riperton Fund of the Concern Foundation for Cancer Research and 
Concern II, by a six-piece band and four backup singers. 
</P>
<P>
So what happened? 
</P>
<P>
The most absorbing moment was when Wonder was on stage alone. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through his two-hour set, the most honored pop-rock performer in Grammy 
history sat behind a synthesizer and told the audience that he was going to 
introduce "Why," a love song that may be on his next album. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out to be a lovely piece of music, but the song itself wasn't the 
most noteworthy aspect of the sequence. Wonder had pre-programmed a computer to 
play the melody, but it malfunctioned -- twice. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than just go on to another number, Wonder was apparently so eager to get 
a reaction to the new number that he switched to the piano to play the song 
live. After a few seconds, however, he stopped. Wanting the extra punctuation 
of the computerized version, Wonder called an aide on stage to help reset the 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
Assured a few minutes later that all was right at last, Wonder again pushed the 
computer keys hopefully. But again there was only a sputter. It must have taken 
10 minutes for Wonder to finally get through "Why." 
</P>
<P>
The segment was typical of the intimate feel of Sunday's concert -- a welcome 
change from the occasionally stiff and overblown nature of his 1986 dates at 
the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Where the emphasis on show-biz flash in those shows made Wonder seem at times 
like someone concerned with competing with the flamboyance of Prince and 
Michael Jackson, he was on Sunday a man more secure with his own art. He was 
sharing his music, not merchandising it. 
</P>
<P>
"I know this is not professional," Wonder said jokingly at one point as he sat 
on the piano bench and used a throat spray device. 
</P>
<P>
If the informal manner was endearing, the music itself was uneven. Because he 
was suffering from a cold, Wonder was not at his best vocally. He had trouble 
hitting some notes, a problem he acknowledged early in the evening. Though his 
outstanding rhythm section (including bassist Nate Watts, drummer Dennis Davis 
and percussionist James Allen) supplied an exceptionally funky edge to songs 
like "Higher Ground," Wonder seemed to keep them in check. 
</P>
<P>
It may have been that the vocal problems kept him from turning the evening into 
an all-out party or maybe he wanted to keep the mood more gentle and 
philosophical out of respect for Minnie Riperton. Wonder wrote "Lovin' You," 
which was a No. 1 single in 1975 for the singer, who died in 1979 of breast 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean the concert was by any means solemn. Wonder involved the 
audience in several sing-alongs and he rolled out some of his liveliest and 
most optimistic numbers. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge, however, for Wonder wasn't to dazzle the crowd with his 
artistry, but to show his concern. A close friend of Riperton, the 38-year-old 
Wonder spoke movingly during the evening about the importance of frequent 
medical checkups and proper diet. 
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned how someone close to him -- an aunt who died recently -- 
might have survived if her cancer had been detected earlier. Wonder also noted 
that the mother of a band member is now gravely ill. 
</P>
<P>
This was not a night to weigh Wonder's artistry, which has been clearly 
established over the years. It was a night to retest his humanity and warmth, 
and he passed that checkup with class. Comedian Louie Anderson opened the 
evening with a 45-minute monologue.

MAKING 'ANYTHING BUT LOVE'; 
</P>
<P>
SERIES PILOT UNDERGOES 'RECONCEPTUALIZATION' TO ELIMINATE TRIANGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The episode of "Anything but Love" that viewers will see at 9:30 tonight on ABC 
is anything but the show initially envisioned by creator Wendy Kout. 
</P>
<P>
In the original pilot for the romantic comedy, Jamie Lee Curtis played Hannah 
Miller, a woman coping with two new developments in her life: a new job as 
managing editor of Chicago Monthly magazine and a several-months-old romance 
with attorney Marty Tills (D. W. Moffett). 
</P>
<P>
Then, Hannah's life got even more complicated: Chicago Monthly hired a brash 
young writer named Jack Burton (Richard Lewis). And Hannah soon found out that 
"Jack Burton" was really Jack Bukowsky, with whom she had had a torrid affair 
many years earlier -- which Jack is more than eager to rekindle. 
</P>
<P>
Which would Hannah choose -- a predictable but stable relationship with Marty, 
or excitement and adventure with Jack, or both? Stay tuned for the next 
episode. 
</P>
<P>
But there was to be no second episode of that story. The pilot, taped last 
summer, was scrapped by the production company after it received an edict from 
ABC: No love triangle. 
</P>
<P>
In the new pilot airing tonight, Hannah Miller is a 29-year-old former teacher 
who had left her hometown of Chicago to move to Los Angeles with her boyfriend, 
an aspiring screenwriter named Jack. Now, that relationship has ended -- and 
the plucky Hannah is returning to Chicago to start all over again and launch a 
writing career of her own. On the plane back to the Windy City, she meets Marty 
Gold (Richard Lewis), a noted writer for Chicago Monthly. Their friendship 
blooms as Marty helps Hannah land her first job in journalism -- as a 
researcher for the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Although the screenwriter Jack will make a brief appearance in a later episode 
to try to win back Hannah, the series now focuses on the developing romance of 
Hannah and Marty, and Hannah's efforts to apply the fierce social conscience 
she developed while teaching in Chicago's tough neighborhoods to her 
journalistic work. 
</P>
<P>
Why did ABC send series creator Kout, who shares executive producer credits on 
the show with Robert Myman and John Ritter ("Anything but Love" is from 
Ritter's company, Adam Productions, in association with Lookout Inc. and 20th 
Century Fox Television), back to the writing table? 
</P>
<P>
Stuart Bloomberg, ABC's vice president for comedy and variety series 
development, explained that neither network executives nor test audiences liked 
the idea of Curtis' character being involved with two men at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
"It puts Jamie Lee's character in an awkward position. Who are you rooting 
for?" Bloomberg said. "Make up your mind. Is she bad, is he bad, is she bad 
because she's sleeping with him, is she leading him on? . . . 
</P>
<P>
It was something that was harmful to her character. It becomes a trap, and in a 
series you're required to deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what we discovered or felt was that a triangle as a concept makes an 
interesting pilot, but becomes rather unwieldy for a series." 
</P>
<P>
Executive producer Myman acknowledged that the triangle aspect and the 
questions it begged about Hannah's morality "was something the network thought 
should be softened." He did not want to offer an opinion about whether the love 
triangle could have worked as a series. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know: We never did a subsequent episode; nobody ever wrote a next 
script," Myman said. "Clearly, in terms of TV comedy, a triangle is not a setup 
we've seen before, which is what interested Wendy Kout in writing about the 
subject. (But) they felt that as a continuing setup, it was not something that 
they wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Kout said ABC programming executives "were originally quite enthused" about the 
first pilot until they got the results of audience research. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, I had no problem with the original pilot," she said. "However, 
given that I am in partnership with ABC and they did, I was requested to 
reconceptualize." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Koenig was added to the staff as supervising producer, and he and Kout 
wrote a new pilot. ABC has ordered six episodes. 
</P>
<P>
Kout said that, while changing the series concept was not her idea, the network 
gave Kout and Koenig free rein in deciding how to change it. 
</P>
<P>
"What I did was basically (keep) the elements that I thought were outstanding 
in the first pilot, specifically in regards to Jamie and Richard's chemistry. I 
loved the idea of watching two people meet and initally become friends -- that 
was something I was delighted to do in the reconceptualization, a contemporary 
adult relationship that begins with friendship." 
</P>
<P>
Kout added that after seeing the first pilot she also wanted "to see Hannah in 
the role of someone who is bucking the system rather than managing the system," 
as she was in her original editor's role. 
</P>
<P>
Although changing a series concept after filming a pilot is often a red flag 
indicating that the show is in trouble, ABC's Bloomberg defended the practice. 
</P>
<P>
"(Often) it just takes some reshaping to find a concept that will work," he 
said. "One of the benefits of going on at midseason is, we had time to examine, 
retool, and come up with a much better, solid show." 
</P>
<P>
Although Kout has worked in series television before, "Anything But Love" is 
the first show she has created. She remains philosophical about having had to 
"reconceptualize." 
</P>
<P>
"You learn in this business that everything is a work in progress," she said.

SCORSESE SEES SUPPORT FOR CONTROVERSIAL ARTWORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Film director Martin Scorsese, who came under attack in the United States and 
abroad for his depiction of a vulnerable and sometimes confused Jesus in the 
film "The Last Temptation of Christ," said Monday that his Academy Award 
nomination for best director serves as a signal of support for other artists' 
controversial works. 
</P>
<P>
"It supports their right to make certain kinds of films and supports the 
American system," said Scorsese, who was in Los Angeles Monday to receive the 
Courage in Filmmaking Award from the Los Angeles Film Teachers Assn. It is the 
first time the group has extended the honor. 
</P>
<P>
The parallels between the violent reaction to "The Last Temptation of Christ" 
and the outcry among Muslims to Salman Rushdie's "The Satanic Verses" were 
obvious to Scorsese. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a fair comparison," he said. "The reaction to 'The Satanic 
Verses' is frightening." 
</P>
<P>
Film rights to Rushdie's novel are available, but no one seems to be jumping at 
the chance to adapt the controversial book to the screen. Would a film maker 
take heart from the support Scorsese has received from the artistic community? 
</P>
<P>
"It has to be made by someone who believes in it," Scorsese said. "Someone 
can't make it to make a quick buck." 
</P>
<P>
Scorsese had been committed to making "The Last Temptation of Christ" for more 
than 10 years. He and screenwriter Paul Schrader began working on an adaptation 
of Nikos Kazantzakis' novel in 1976 and it had come close many times to being 
produced, only to be shelved, before Universal stepped up to take the heat. 
</P>
<P>
Since the film opened last August, it has been denounced as blasphemous by 
fundamentalist Christians and has been banned in India, Israel, South Africa 
and Athens. Its opening in France incited violent protests. 
</P>
<P>
Scorsese said he did not set out to provoke controversy, but he is heartened by 
the fact that "The Last Temptation of Christ" "opened up a dialogue" both in 
American churches and in homes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's become a very strong tool in discussion, in making the concept of Jesus 
and the religion alive and vibrant for today," he said. "That's really what I 
set out to do." 
</P>
<P>
A lapsed Roman Catholic who was educated in Catholic schools, Scorsese said he 
understands the concerns of protesters, though he believes the film is not 
blasphemous . 
</P>
<P>
"We're dealing with people who, I think, mean well, to a certain extent, but 
their interpretation of the Gospel adheres to the word of the Gospel, and (my 
interpretation) is different," Scorsese said. "I really do understand how they 
feel about it, but what surprises me is their intolerance to my belief." 
</P>
<P>
He said he was surprised by his Oscar nomination because he feared the protests 
that surrounded the film might have put people off. 
</P>
<P>
"The film has not really been seen as a movie because of the other issues that 
are in the way," Scorsese said. "Rather than a movie it became a news event." 
</P>
<P>
Scorsese said he is particularly happy to receive an award from a teachers 
group. 
</P>
<P>
"The primary job of a teacher in America is to open the minds of the students, 
make them think," he said. "Maybe that has something to do with this award."

IT'S EASIER TO LEND AMERICA MONEY; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTORS ARE LINING UP TO BUY T-BILLS FROM THE FED. THEY'RE FINDING IMPROVED 
SPACE, STAFF -- AND RATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
John Wessel and his wife Ann have been buying Treasury bills in person for 15 
years and remember the time a few years ago when lines of buyers often went out 
the door of the old Federal Reserve branch bank in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Today, with T-bills yielding their highest rates in four years, long lines have 
reappeared on Monday mornings, the day when three- and six-month bills are 
auctioned. But if the experiences of dozens of investors this latest Monday 
morning were typical, buying these securities in person is no longer much of a 
hassle. 
</P>
<P>
Although getting through on the phone for more information has been a 
time-consuming experience lately, buying T-bills directly is relatively 
painless and quick, investors said. Thanks to computers, more efficient forms 
and increased assistance from Fed staffers, many buyers Monday morning were in 
and out in no more than five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no comparison to the way it was before," said Wessel, a retired Los 
Angeles engineer whose buying expedition Monday was his second this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I considered doing it by mail, but I like the idea of doing it myself," he 
added. "Then I know it's done properly." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, speedy processing is good news for thousands of investors like Wessel 
who have flocked to buy Treasury bills in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The volume of offers to buy bills -- either in person or by mail -- is running 
five times over the level a year ago at the Federal Reserve's new Los Angeles 
branch at 950 S. Grand, said Cindy M. Stewart, assistant manager of marketable 
securities. In the week ended Feb. 24, individual tenders (bids to purchase) 
totaled nearly 1,500, up from about 260 in the same week a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Individual purchases have been averaging $50,000 to $60,000, with some as large 
as $200,000 or $300,000 although many are at the minimum of $10,000, Stewart 
said. On top of actual tenders, the branch has been receiving 1,000 calls a day 
from prospective buyers asking for more information. That is triple the level 
when T-bill rates are not so high, Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
Investors have been attracted to T-bills for many reasons. One of the most 
frequently cited is their safety: Treasuries, as all Treasury securities are 
called, are backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government. Some 
investors, concerned about the financial soundness of many banks and savings 
and loans, have pulled money out of them despite federal deposit insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Many investors also are attracted by the exemption from state taxes of interest 
on Treasury securities. Others simply invest out of force of habit. 
</P>
<P>
But investors interviewed Monday indicated that the biggest reason is simply 
high rates. At Monday's auction, three-month T-bills went for an average 
discount rate of 8.65%, producing an actual annual investment yield of 8.97%. 
Six-month bills sold at an average discount rate of 8.66%, meaning an actual 
yield of 9.18%. 
</P>
<P>
T-bills are sold at a discount from face value; the actual yield is higher 
because it is calculated based on the amount you pay, not the face value. 
Monday, a $10,000, three-month bill sold for $9,781.30 and a six-month bill for 
$9,562.20. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Better Than S&amp;L Rates 
</P>
<P>
Both were slightly off from last week's yields, but they were the highest since 
March, 1985. By contrast, a year ago, rates and yields were about three 
percentage points lower. 
</P>
<P>
"The interest rates are better than at S&amp;Ls," said Charles Howard, a Los 
Angeles retiree who has been buying Treasuries for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that bank deposits are insured up to $100,000, but my reason (for 
buying T-bills) is the higher interest rates and the fact that I don't have to 
pay state tax," said Madeline F. Koenig, a homemaker from Downey and 15-year 
veteran of T-bill investing. 
</P>
<P>
Buying T-bills is often described as a complicated process, but many first-time 
buyers said they were not daunted. 
</P>
<P>
One first-timer, Karen Peterson, a Torrance bank accountant, said she went in 
directly after investigating several savings institutions that she said would 
have charged her as much as $40 in fees for investments in Treasuries. That is 
enough to wipe out much of the interest earnings on smaller denominations. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson was in and out of the Federal Reserve branch in less than five 
minutes. "It was fine; someone was here to answer all my questions," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Several buyers said they reduce hassle and time by filling out bid forms in 
advance. The time also is reduced because the Fed branch provides staff members 
in the lobby to answer questions from the growing numbers of first-time buyers. 
And tellers at the counters use computers to put purchase information directly 
into investors' accounts, unlike several years ago when all work was done 
manually. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Phone Still a Headache 
</P>
<P>
Also, the lobby of the Fed's new branch bank is more spacious than the one at 
the old office. The branch has occupied the new quarters for two years, after 
moving from its old residence on Olympic Boulevard around the corner. There, 
lines went out the door often because the lobby was too small and processing 
was slower. That is unlikely in the new branch's cavernous lobby. 
</P>
<P>
But while going in person can be smooth, getting information over the phone 
from a staffer lately has been a headache, Fed officials admit. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent week, callers to the live help lines got close to 20,000 busy 
signals, compared to about 5,000 calls that got through, the Fed's Stewart 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, more help is on the way. The Fed branch plans to add five more 
phone lines and staff members to answer them next week, more than doubling the 
current level of three people, she said.

NO EVIDENCE THAT 'SYNERGIES' THEORY WORKS, THEY SAY;

SOME QUESTION ADVANTAGE OF TIME-WARNER DEAL

Sony buys CBS Records. A big French publisher buys Women's Day and 11 other 
U.S. magazines. Rupert Murdoch snatches up 20th Century-Fox movie studio, the 
Metromedia television stations, TV Guide. And now the biggest of all: Warner 
Communications merges with Time Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Is the media and entertainment world merging into a few global titans that will 
eventually squeeze out smaller players in a competitive world war? 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Time and Warner say their worries about the emerging competition 
was a primary reason for their union, announced Saturday. They see a handful of 
giant concerns buying up publishing houses, movie and TV studios, distribution 
businesses, record companies, television stations and cable systems. 
</P>
<P>
It won't be long, they warn, before communications companies that don't follow 
suit will find themselves in financial danger. 
</P>
<P>
"The minute you let your guard down, you'll be swallowed up," Time Inc. Chief 
Executive J. Richard Munro said Monday as executives of Warner Communications 
and Time explained the reasons for their merger, which will create the world's 
largest media and entertainment concern. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Chairman Steven J. Ross added that competing in the business will be 
like driving a car up a steep grade. "The minute you put it in neutral, you're 
going to be at the bottom of the hill," he warned. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of other people say, "Nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
The skeptics say that despite the recent torrid pace of media mergers, the 
advantages of the communications conglomerates may not be as great as they 
appear. They certainly aren't great enough to keep strong new companies from 
elbowing their way into the business, as they always have in the past, critics 
contend. 
</P>
<P>
"The communications business has so much activity and change that I just don't 
believe it's possible for a few giants to control the information flow around 
the world," said J. Kendrick Noble, an analyst with Paine Webber in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of these new media giants is to cut the high risks of producing their 
various products by selling them in many forms and markets around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Warner and Time will gain complementary advantages -- "synergies," in the 
threadbare term -- as soon as they merge. The expertise and inventory of 
Warner's Warner Bros. studio will provide programming for Time's Home Box 
Office pay-TV unit in new ventures as well as current ones. 
</P>
<P>
Time will benefit from the overseas marketing and distribution strength of 
Warner, which distributes its own records and films, and the films of Walt 
Disney Co., abroad. Warner should be assisted in selling its products by the 
direct-marketing expertise of Time Inc., which is the largest in the business, 
analysts speculate. 
</P>
<P>
Executives of the company say they expect that their mutual strengths will 
allow them to capitalize on the new television markets that are opening with 
deregulation in Europe and Asia. They decline to be specific about their plans, 
but analysts speculate that they may try to provide not only movies and 
television programming, but also cable systems and direct-broadcast satellite 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
"As Asia follows Europe in deregulation, we expect to be the blue chip provider 
in the market," said Nicholas J. Nicholas Jr., Time's president. 
</P>
<P>
The company may envision a day when it will have the kind of close integration 
that many media companies admire in Murdoch's News Corp. The programs that are 
produced on Murdoch's Fox studio can be broadcast through the Fox Broadcasting 
Co. stations in the United States and on Murdoch's Sky Channel satellite 
operation in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
News Corp. can offer advertisers package rates in its publications. And it can 
buy newsprint and equipment for its 150 publications at a discount. 
</P>
<P>
But many experts question how great those advantages really can be. 
</P>
<P>
The drawbacks of such attempts at "vertical integration" have been apparent in 
the past. Harcourt Brace, for example, once purchased a paperback publishing 
operation, called Jove, with the intent of using its Harcourt's hardback books 
as a source of paperbacks, Noble recalled. 
</P>
<P>
But Jove's editors didn't feel that Harcourt books were the best for their 
paperback line. Ultimately, the business was sold to MCA. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conflicting Interests 
</P>
<P>
Taft Broadcasting -- which has since been broken up -- owned not just 
television stations but Hanna-Barbera Productions, the renowned producer of 
cartoons. But while this arrangement was expected to give the stations a ready 
source of product, the TV station managers often found programming they 
preferred, and sold the cartoons to others. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever you might say about synergies, the interests of the producers and 
distributors aren't the same," said Alan J. Gottesman, also an analyst with 
Paine Webber. 
</P>
<P>
Noble said the idea of dominant media companies came from Europe, where, in 
fact, some companies have historically dominated large shares of newspaper and 
book publishing and printing businesses, and other media. 
</P>
<P>
But while such Europeans as Robert Maxwell, chairman of the Great Britain-based 
Maxwell Communications, do believe that a new class of media giants is 
emerging, "lots of smart people believe too many different businesses can lead 
to management neglect of some of them," said Noble. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worldwide Ads 
</P>
<P>
CBS and Playboy Enterprises were among the companies that diversified into 
other media, then sold off their holdings to pay closer attention to their core 
businesses. Others, such as newspaper giant Gannett Co., have made conscious 
decisions to concentrate on the United States from reluctance to take on such 
unpredictable factors as foreign regulation, labor practices and currency 
exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
It has also not been established that worldwide media enterprises can attract 
advertisers willing to buy ads in the media of different countries. Some blame 
the disappointing performance of Murdoch's Sky Channel on the sharp cultural 
differences between viewers in various European nations. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts question whether Time and Warner officials would have faced a 
competitive threat if they chose to remain alone. "I just can't see how any 
competitors could keep the magazines of Time Inc., or the programming or 
records of Warner, from making money," said Andrew Horneck, research director 
of the Veronis, Suhler &amp; Associates investment bank. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts even question whether the two companies' executives are truly 
motivated by a fear of the new global competitors. "It sounds good to say 
you're worried about these foreign threats, but I think other factors, like 
their fear of a takeover, were probably much more important in this," said 
Peter Wade, president of the New York office of J. B. Were &amp; Son.

threat to jet plant workers, medical experts told a Senate subcommittee Monday, 
charging two leading manufacturers with failing to provide safe working 
conditions for employees. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed and Boeing employees in Burbank and Seattle respectively have suffered 
severe headaches, rashes, chest pains and damage to the central nervous system 
because of exposure to chemicals in the composites -- lightweight materials 
made of plastics mixed with carbon, ceramic or synthetic fibers, the doctors 
told the subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
But representatives of the firms defended themselves, saying they had improved 
handling of the materials, which they had believed safe and which appeal to the 
industry because of their strength and resistance to fire. 
</P>
<P>
And though they sought to dissuade senators from considering new rules 
governing composites -- which absorb rather than reflect radar waves and thus 
are used extensively in military craft such as the stealth fighter -- at least 
one lawmaker said Monday that he believes that more regulations are needed. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Harry Reid (R-Nev.), chairman of the toxic substances subcommittee of the 
Environment and Public Works Committee, opened the hearings on composites 
Monday, saying: "These impressive leaps in technology have made us a more 
productive society. But is it possible that advancing technology is also making 
us sick?" 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, he said he believes that legislation is needed to strengthen 
laws on toxic substances in the workplace and to provide for more stringent 
enforcement of existing regulations. "It is clear that things can't continue 
going the way they are," he said. "Certainly we have to do a better job than we 
are." 
</P>
<P>
Exposure victims and health experts argued that composites must be handled with 
specific safety procedures -- such as good ventilation and the use of 
respirators and gloves. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Told They Were Safe 
</P>
<P>
Those steps were not required at Boeing or Lockheed, despite repeated employee 
appeals, some victims told the subcommittee Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie Faye Schrum, who worked at Boeing for 10 years, said her supervisors 
told her that the materials "wouldn't hurt you. Later on, they said you have to 
wear gloves (and) masks. But most of the time they didn't even have them." 
</P>
<P>
Schrum said her work at Boeing caused her to suffer severe headaches, lack of 
energy and memory loss. But "you either worked with this material or you didn't 
have a job," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Allergist Gordon Baker said his examination of more than 130 Boeing employees 
who had become ill after exposure to the composite materials shows that "we 
have a widespread problem that we are just beginning to recognize." 
</P>
<P>
Baker said many Boeing employees he examined showed signs of "organic brain 
poisoning," a condition that affects personality and rational judgment and 
"tends not to get better." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Ballster, of the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond, agreed 
that changes need to be made in federal rules governing use of chemicals in the 
workplace. "There are many, many chemicals that can affect the nervous system, 
and we need some type of improvement" in the toxic substances act, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Noted Dr. Alan Broughton, of the Antibody Assay Laboratories in Santa Ana: 
"There is no doubt in our mind that low-level exposure to chemicals such as 
formaldehyde (which is used in some composites) causes human illness (that is) 
debilitating, and often patients complain of an inability to exist in modern 
society." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Peritore, a Boeing vice president, defended his company, saying that 
initial tests found the materials to be safe. After the company received many 
worker complaints, he noted, toxic elements in the composites were eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the materials used to create composites today have some toxic 
properties and present some risk, but they can be used safely," he said, adding 
that, "throughout this entire episode, Boeing not only met, but significantly 
bettered all regulatory standards for safety." 
</P>
<P>
While conceding past problems, Dale Daniels, Lockheed executive vice president, 
told senators that new rules to govern composites in the workplace are not 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
"I have now told the employees (that) if they are not sure it is safe, don't do 
it," he said, adding that enforcement of existing safety rules and better 
internal company communication would help solve problems. 
</P>
<P>
But representatives of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration called for more action against toxic 
materials.

HARRY BERNSTEIN / LABOR: LAW STACKED AGAINST STRIKERS AT EASTERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo seems to be doing more to unite America's 
unions than almost any union leader has in recent history. He apparently is 
even helping labor win some rare public support. 
</P>
<P>
The hard-nosed Lorenzo has managed these feats by first breaking unions at 
Continental Airlines in 1983 and by his unrelenting effort to blame Eastern 
Airlines' troubles on his workers. They have already made $1.5 billion in wage 
concessions and, embittered, provided poor passenger service before they 
reluctantly went on strike Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo, whose company owns both Continental and Eastern, seems to be waking 
unions up to the fact that if they don't support each other in the pivotal 
Eastern battle, the strength of all unions will continue to diminish. 
</P>
<P>
Despite labor's impressive unity, the legal system is stacked in Lorenzo's 
favor. 
</P>
<P>
He could beat the Eastern strikers by declaring bankruptcy and dismantling the 
company, selling some parts and moving the rest elsewhere in his giant airline 
conglomerate. Or he could sell what's left of Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, though, it wouldn't be much of a victory for him financially or 
even emotionally because he would be quitting the fight he started. 
</P>
<P>
The law allows Lorenzo another alternative: continue to try to crush the unions 
by hiring enough strikebreakers to fly the planes and later sell the company at 
a higher price, giving him a more satisfying victory. 
</P>
<P>
So far, that battle plan is failing. Most flights were called off Monday, and 
5,000 workers were laid off temporarily, but Lorenzo hasn't thrown in the towel 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
And on Lorenzo's side is not only President Bush, but some strange Supreme 
Court interpretations of federal labor law. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford Prof. William B. Gould IV gets laughs out of students in his labor law 
classes when he poses an old conundrum about the right of workers to strike in 
this free society: 
</P>
<P>
How is it possible for federal law to specifically say it is illegal for 
employers to punish workers who go on strike by "firing" them and at the same 
time say a company can "permanently replace" them? 
</P>
<P>
The answer is simple, if inadequate: because 51 years ago -- and again last 
week -- the Supreme Court said so. 
</P>
<P>
The legal puzzle Gould raises in his classes might be good for some cynical 
laughs, but it isn't funny to strikers whose jobs have been taken by 
strikebreakers. 
</P>
<P>
At Eastern, Lorenzo began hiring and training strikebreakers months before the 
International Assn. of Machinists went on strike to resist demands for more 
concessions with no assurance that they would gain a future at the airline. 
</P>
<P>
The entire labor movement has joined the battle because even a Pyrrhic victory 
for Lorenzo could do more damage to unions than former President Reagan 
inflicted when he fired 11,000 striking air traffic controllers in 1981, 
serving as an influential model for employers who want to break strikes. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's firing of the controllers was a cruel, disruptive action. But it was 
legal because the law prohibits strikes by federal workers such as the 
controllers. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Reagan, Lorenzo cannot fire his striking workers. But he legally can 
replace them permanently. And if he succeeds in this widely watched drama, more 
and more employers can be expected to join the anti-union crusade Reagan 
encouraged in the controllers' strike. 
</P>
<P>
Bush became part of that crusade when he backed Lorenzo by denying labor's plea 
for a 60-day cooling-off period, thus allowing Lorenzo to get the strike he 
sought and slash everyone's wages at once. 
</P>
<P>
By siding with Lorenzo, Bush became the first President to refuse a request by 
federal mediators to order the cooling-off period in an airline dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the Supreme Court has figured that somehow it would make workers feel 
better if they were not fired for exercising their legal right to strike and 
instead just were replaced permanently. 
</P>
<P>
True, the court says "replaced" strikers have a better chance of getting 
another job in the same company than those who were flat-out fired -- but that 
happens only if another job opens up. 
</P>
<P>
The high court ruling 51 years ago said an employer cannot fire strikers but 
can "protect and continue his business" by keeping strikebreakers after a 
walkout is over and not making room for workers who went out on strike. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court decision last week affirmed the earlier ruling and, not 
unexpectedly, made it clear that a company can also keep union members who 
cross their own union's picket line. 
</P>
<P>
Both decisions make a mockery of the 1935 labor law that was supposed to give 
workers the legal right to strike without being punished for exercising that 
right. 
</P>
<P>
Congress can unravel the legal conundrum by amending the law to make certain 
that its clear intent is carried out, providing a better balance between the 
rights of workers and employers in a labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Joseph E. Brennan (D-Me.) has proposed a compromise to make the ability to 
strike more meaningful and still give employers a chance to ultimately force 
strikers to put their jobs on the line if no contract agreement is reached. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan proposes that for the first 10 weeks of a strike, employers should not 
be allowed to permanently replace strikers. That's a good starting point, but 
10 weeks is not long enough. 
</P>
<P>
Workers' right to strike should be protected for one year before employers are 
allowed to offer permanent jobs to strikebreakers. At that point, almost all 
strikes either have been settled by negotiations or lost. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe, as some contend, strikes now are almost obsolete as labor's weapon of 
last resort. Last year, there were fewer strikes than in any of the previous 41 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Unions may have to use more consumer boycotts and work slowdowns and put more 
pressure on suppliers, banks and other companies that help struck companies. 
</P>
<P>
But a bit more balance between labor and management must be restored by at 
least amending the law to make certain workers such as those at Eastern have a 
reasonable amount of time to exercise their legal right to strike without 
suffering the punishment of losing their jobs.

T-bill Rates Dip: The Treasury Department sold $7.2 billion of new three-month 
bills at an average discount rate of 8.65%, down from 8.73% last week. Another 
$7.2 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount rate of 
8.66%, down from 8.77% last week. The new discount rates understate the actual 
return to investors -- 8.97% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,781.30, and 9.18% for a six-month bill selling for $9,562.20. The 
discount rate reflects the price discount received when government securities 
are purchased at less than face value.

Lotus Wins Court Case: Lotus Development Corp. announced that a federal judge 
has dismissed all claims made by SAPC Inc. against Lotus and its founder, 
Mitchell D. Kapor. In November, U.S. District Judge Robert E. Keeton dismissed 
SAPC's claim of copyright infringement, ruling that SAPC gave up its right to 
sue when it sold most of its assets to Lotus in 1985. Keeton dismissed all 
remaining charges against Lotus and Kapor last week. Those claims included 
charges of breach of contract, misappropriation of trade secrets and 
confidential secrets and unjust enrichment.

Newsweek Scoops Time: Newsweek magazine scooped its chief rival, Time, on one 
of the biggest business deals of the year: the $18-billion proposed merger 
between Time Inc. and Warner Communications Inc. Newsweek included a two-page 
story on the proposed deal in its March 13 issue, but this week's Time is 
silent on the merger that was announced hours before the magazines went to 
press Saturday night. "We never intended to cover the merger in the news 
pages," Time spokesman Louis J. Slovinsky said.

18 LAWYERS TO DEFECT FROM SHEA &amp; GOULD'S L.A. OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles office of Shea &amp; Gould, one of the nation's biggest and 
most prestigious law firms, was rocked Monday by the disclosure that 18 of its 
lawyers will leave to join a fast-growing competitor. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to Shea &amp; Gould said the firm is considering shutting its 3 
1/2-year-old Los Angeles office as a result of the defections. The New 
York-based firm currently has 70 lawyers here. 
</P>
<P>
The departing lawyers, including eight partners and 10 associates, are leaving 
Shea &amp; Gould by the end of March to open a Los Angeles office for Myerson 
&amp; Kuhn. Founded only 14 months ago, Myerson &amp; Kuhn has grown to a firm 
of more than 150 lawyers with headquarters in New York and additional offices 
in Philadelphia, Washington and Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Both firms have ties to baseball history. One of Myerson &amp; Kuhn's 
co-founders, Bowie Kuhn, is a former commissioner of major league baseball. The 
name of one of Shea &amp; Gould's founders, William A. Shea, is on the New York 
Mets stadium in Queens. 
</P>
<P>
Heading the group leaving the Shea &amp; Gould office are senior partners Alan 
U. Schwartz, Leon M. Cooper and Robert H. London, a former Los Angeles Superior 
Court judge. Schwartz said the defections stemmed from disagreements over 
compensation and "on how the office should be run." 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for Shea &amp; Gould could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Shea &amp; Gould entered the Los Angeles market in mid-1985 by acquiring the 
Century City firm of Pacht, Ross, Warne, Bernhard &amp; Sears. 
</P>
<P>
The firm's arrival here dovetailed with a growing influx of New York law firms 
to the area.

SOVIETS WILLING TO CUT PRODUCTION IN EFFORT TO BOOST WORLD OIL PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Soviet Union is prepared to cut its oil production for at least six months 
in cooperation with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in an 
effort to raise world oil prices, Soviet officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Officials announced a 5% cutback in Soviet oil sold on the open market or 
delivered to Western customers on contract and said it would amount to 100,000 
barrels a day over the next six months. 
</P>
<P>
Western observers said it was the first time the Soviets -- the world's biggest 
oil producer -- have publicly announced steps to bolster OPEC. But they said it 
wouldn't have a dramatic effect on oil markets and noted that Soviet production 
might have fallen anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets, which have long supported the goals of OPEC to boost and stabilize 
oil prices, join China, Mexico, Egypt, Malaysia, Oman and other non-OPEC oil 
exporting nations which have recently announced steps intended to bolster 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
Vasily A. Dinkov, the Soviet oil minister, said at a news conference that 
Moscow viewed a price of about $20 a barrel as high enough to make production 
viable. World prices currently range from about $16 to $19 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Further Efforts Possible 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, analysts credited the Soviet announcement 
for sending the April contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. 
crude, up a modest 11 cents to $18.67 a barrel. OPEC crude oils typically sell 
for $1.50 a barrel less. The cartel's official goal is to reach an average 
price of $18 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow is clearly hoping that the consolidated action by OPEC and non-OPEC 
members will eventually push oil prices back up and that it will be able to 
recover initial losses through subsequent price rises. 
</P>
<P>
Grant Margulov, the first deputy chairman of the Bureau on the Fuel and Energy 
Industries, said the cutback symbolized Moscow's desire to cooperate with OPEC 
pricing and supply policy and that further joint actions were possible. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet Union shares in the efforts made by other states in maintaining 
closer cooperation with OPEC countries to achieve stable oil prices acceptable 
to both importer and exporter," Margulov said, putting the 5% reduction in the 
context of Moscow's participation as an observer at recent OPEC conferences. 
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to cooperate closely with OPEC countries and take possible 
joint actions if necessary," he said. "As for cutting back our exports, the 
decision we have taken is for the first half of the year, and the future will 
show if we will maintain this form of cooperation. This question is being 
considered at the moment." 
</P>
<P>
However, the Soviet Union's mature oil fields and weak technology have made it 
difficult to prevent declines in oil production anyway, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
"We put the Soviet announcement in the same category as some of the other 
announcements by non-OPEC countries," said Thomas Burns, manager of the 
economic staff at Chevron Corp. in San Francisco, one of the leading oil giants 
in the race to do business in the Soviet Union. "It is nice to show support for 
OPEC, but it is not going to be terribly significant." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts generally agree that there is less to some of the non-OPEC pledges 
than meets the eye. Production cuts by Mexico, Egypt and some other nations are 
less policy decisions than examples of bowing to the inevitable, one observer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union's oil totaled about 12 million barrels a day last year -- 
roughly 45% more than that of the United States and three times that of Saudi 
Arabia -- but it uses more than two thirds of that petroleum itself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Revenue Problems 
</P>
<P>
More than half of the Soviet exports of oil and oil products in 1987 went to 
Moscow's partners in the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, the socialist 
trading bloc known as Comecon, and to other close allies. Soviet officials said 
the cutbacks will not affect sales to the East Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Finland, France, Italy, Spain and West Germany also bought substantial amounts 
of Soviet oil, according to Soviet trade figures for the year, the last for 
which complete statistics are available. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow, in fact, relies heavily on its oil and gas exports to finance its 
imports of Western machinery, and a 5% cutback represents a further reduction 
of hard currency revenue. Together, oil and gas constitute nearly 35% of Soviet 
exports by value -- and about 60% of its hard currency earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Declining prices for oil and gas on the international market resulted in $64 
billion in lost export revenue for the country over the past three years, 
according to Finance Ministry officials. This has been an important factor in 
the growing budget deficit, which is emerging as a major economic problem here.

JAPAN DENIES OBLIGATION TO HIKE U.S. CHIP IMPORTS

Japan is not obliged to increase American semiconductor manufacturers' share of 
this country's computer chip market, a Japanese trade ministry official said 
Monday, disputing American officials. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no legally binding agreement except the semiconductor agreement," an 
official of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. government officials have said Japan has failed to live up to a commitment 
to increase the percentage of the Japanese chip market held by American 
companies, while Japanese officials say they made no such commitment. Former 
Commerce Department official Clyde Prestowitz alleged last year in his book, 
"Trading Places: How America Allowed Japan to Take the Lead," that the Japanese 
government pledged in a secret document to raise the U.S. market share of 
semiconductors in Japan to 20% by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter of last year, the latest period for which there are 
statistics, foreign manufacturers had 10.9% of Japan's chip market, the MITI 
official said in an interview. The U.S. Commerce Department says the American 
share rose from 9.2% in 1987 to 9.5% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1986 semiconductor agreement, Japan pledged not to dump computer chips -- 
selling them at less than fair market value -- in the United States, and to 
increase American access to Japan's chip market.

Prestowitz wrote that there was a confidential side letter in which "the 
Japanese said that they understood, welcomed and would make efforts to assist 
the U.S. companies in reaching their goal of a 20% market share within five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. negotiators said that this commitment meant there would be a 
guaranteed increase in the U.S. share of the Japanese market," Prestowitz 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese officials will not confirm the existence of a separate document 
accompanying the semiconductor agreement, but say there was no document that 
holds them to increasing U.S. market share. 
</P>
<P>
"In a sense, he (Prestowitz) is wrong because there are no legally binding 
documents. In fact, U.S. government statements never admitted to the existence 
of such a document," the MITI official said. 
</P>
<P>
"In general there are a lot of letters of exchange between the U.S. and Japan 
in any kind of trade negotiations," he said. "Sometimes they're secret and 
sometimes they're not." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if there was an informal agreement by the Japanese government on a 20% 
share for U.S. chip manufacturers, the official said, "No comment." 
</P>
<P>
But he added, "Imagine if there was such a letter. It wouldn't represent a 
commitment to a market share."

Apple Computer Inc. is expected today to introduce a scaled-down but powerful 
addition to its Macintosh personal computer line, analysts said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The new model, called the Macintosh IIcx, will be based on the Motorola Inc. 
68030 microprocessor but will be somewhat smaller than the current Mac II's, 
they said. The machine is smaller because it has just three slots for expansion 
boards, as opposed to six for the standard Mac II. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts expect the computer to be priced between $4,000 and $7,000, depending 
on configuration. 
</P>
<P>
Macweek, an industry trade magazine, reported last week that the IIcx will have 
at least one megabyte of random access memory and will feature a sophisticated 
disk drive. One analyst said the top-end version will probably have four 
megabytes of RAM and an 80-megabyte disk drive. 
</P>
<P>
Apple would not confirm price, features, or even the existence of the machine.

LOTTO WINNER JUST NEVER GAVE UP

<P>
Patience, steady betting and dreaming of "the big one" paid off for Jose Amador 
Granados of Anaheim over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Granados, a Mexican national who has lived in California for 14 years, was one 
of the four winners of the $44.9-million California Lotto 6-49 jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
He is expected to clear about $448,000 annually for the next 20 years after the 
federal government takes out 20% in taxes, state lottery officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
An avid lottery player, Granados said he has spent at least $30 a week on 
tickets since the lottery began 3 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I go to buy something, I buy a ticket," he said. He estimated that 
he has spent more than $3,000 on tickets altogether. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying and trying," he said during an interview Monday at the Laguna 
Hills landscaping company where he is a supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
"I never had this much money before." 
</P>
<P>
No probability theory or birthdates played roles in Granados' number selection, 
which he left to chance. The "pick six" computer chose his winning combination 
of 16-26-27-36-43-45. 
</P>
<P>
Granados, 30, said he had trouble sleeping Sunday night because of the 
excitement. "I feel good, but at the same time I feel different." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he insisted, riches will not change him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still the same person; my personality is going to be the same," he said, 
"I don't like to change." 
</P>
<P>
Granados said he will keep his job. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Lawson, owner of Lawson Landscaping Maintenance where Granados has worked 
for 6 years, said he wasn't too happy about Granados' good fortune. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't thrilled he won, actually, because I didn't want him to quit," Lawson 
said, only half joking. Managers described Granados as a hard worker -- he 
works 6 days a week -- and a good employee who had worked his way up to 
supervise several crews totaling about 35 men. 
</P>
<P>
With about a dozen gold chains draped about his neck and showy gold rings that 
he wears on both hands every day, Granados sported a bit of a nouveau riche 
look Monday. But he said his first purchase from the lottery check, which he 
expects in 3 weeks, will be a practical one -- a home for his parents who live 
alternately in Tijuana and California. Then, he said, he will buy a new car for 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he will handle people who are expected to ask him for donations, 
Granados replied that he likes to help poor people. 
</P>
<P>
"I am of poor people; we came from Mexico," he explained. "When I have 
something, I like to help the poor people." 
</P>
<P>
The winning ticket was purchased at an Albertson's on Campus Drive in Irvine, 
which lottery officials said will get about $56,000, or 0.05%, as its share of 
the winnings. 
</P>
<P>
The three others winners were James Hickey of La Puente, James Hurley of 
Hayward and Charles Johnson of San Francisco.

6-MONTH EVALUATION OF SHERYL MASSIP'S MENTAL STATE URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A confidential report recommends that Sheryl Lynn Massip be confined to a 
psychiatric institution for at least 6 months to evaluate whether she has 
recovered from a psychotic illness that contributed to the killing of her 
infant son, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The report, completed last week by county health officials, will help Superior 
Court Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald determine how best to proceed when the 
24-year-old Massip returns to his courtroom on Friday, almost 2 years after she 
ran over her son in the family car. 
</P>
<P>
The report's conclusion may hurt efforts by Massip's attorney, who contends she 
is now sane, to spare the former Anaheim housewife any further confinement. 
Massip was evaluated on an out-patient basis last month by county specialists. 
</P>
<P>
Massip said in an interview that the prospect of 6 months in confinement 
"doesn't scare me. I've learned to try and take each day one at a time, because 
I've had to live that way now for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Fitzgerald threw out a jury's verdict that found Massip guilty of 
murder and ruled that she was not guilty by reason of insanity. The judge held 
that she was suffering at the time from postpartum psychosis, a temporary 
disorder that is thought to cause delusions, hallucinations and even violence 
in about 3 of every 1,000 new mothers. 
</P>
<P>
Massip testified that she heard voices telling her to "put (her 6-week-old son) 
out of its misery" shortly before she first tried to throw the child into 
oncoming traffic, then hit him over the head with a blunt object and finally 
ran him over with her car on April 29, 1987. She then stuffed the body in a 
trash can and told police that the boy had been kidnaped. 
</P>
<P>
Under Fitzgerald's finding of insanity, Massip would routinely be ordered to 
undergo a 6-month examination, probably at Patton State Hospital, to determine 
whether she should be incarcerated for up to 11 years in a mental institution. 
</P>
<P>
But defense attorney Milton C. Grimes argued in a recent interview that the 
unusual nature of Massip's case -- which has drawn national attention to the 
issue of postpartum psychosis -- justifies abandoning standard criminal 
insanity procedures. 
</P>
<P>
"Sheryl is not crazy today and I see no reason why she should have to be 
punished any further," Grimes said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Tom Borris, pleased by the county's preliminary finding, 
said: "This is a favorable recommendation because (county personnel) followed 
the penal code. 
</P>
<P>
"But as far as what's going to happen Friday, I've learned not to expect 
anything in this case. All I know is what the law says -- that she should be 
sent away for 6 months of tests." 
</P>
<P>
Although Massip could under Fitzgerald's ruling be confined to a mental 
facility for up to 11 years, both the prosecution and the defense agree that 
her actual incarceration will likely be far shorter than that because of her 
improved mental condition today. Massip's family members say that they have 
seen a dramatic improvement in her mental health in recent months. Her bouts 
with depression are far more infrequent, they say, and hormonal treatments and 
counseling have helped her eating and sleeping patterns, as well as her 
physical condition. 
</P>
<P>
County health professionals, while making no finding on Massip's overall 
sanity, noted in their report to Fitzgerald that she now appears neat and 
well-groomed and her thought, speech and judgment all appear normal, according 
to an official familiar with the report who asked anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Madrigal, program manager for the county's correctional mental health 
division, refused to discuss the county's findings, except to confirm that the 
report on Massip's case had been completed. 
</P>
<P>
Borris said he believed the county's recommendation was mandated by its 
understanding of the law, rather than based on an analysis of Massip's current 
mental state and the need for future treatment.

SOLDIER WHO LEFT POST IN WEST GERMANY IS CHARGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MITCHELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Army on Monday charged intelligence specialist Michael Peri with leaving 
his post without permission, a security violation and petty theft, but it would 
not say whether he entered East Germany illegally. 
</P>
<P>
Peri, 21, a specialist fourth class whose family lives in Laguna Niguel, 
disappeared from the U.S. military base in Fulda, West Germany, on Feb. 20. He 
voluntarily turned himself in to military authorities at the base Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
He has so far refused to cooperate with investigators and has said nothing 
about his absence or where he had been, Lt. Col. Jake Dye, an Army spokesman, 
said in a telephone interview from West Germany Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Peri, on the advice of his lawyers, has refused to say anything to the 
investigators," Dye said. Dye added that Peri has been moved to a military 
detention center in Mannheim, West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The security charge stems from his alleged violation of a kilometer-wide 
military buffer zone on the East German border, Dye said. Peri had checked out 
a military jeep that was found within a mile of the border. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Monday's charges, Peri faces charges of the theft of a portable 
computer taken from the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment office and of a friend's 
compact disc player, Dye said. 
</P>
<P>
Dye said that investigators are trying to find out why Peri took the computer 
and why the Jeep was found so near the East German border. 
</P>
<P>
"Our investigation is not over yet," Dye said. "We still have some very serious 
concerns about possible breaches of security. We don't know if he crossed into 
East Germany, but he came about as close as you can get." 
</P>
<P>
Still troubling investigators is the matter of why the portable computer was 
taken from the office. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sticking Point' 
</P>
<P>
"That's the sticking point," Dye said. "All I can say is that we have plenty of 
questions that need answers." He added that Army investigators may file 
additional charges if further evidence is found. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dye, Peri, who has been stationed in West Germany since March, 
1988, was "well versed" in the rules governing entry into the buffer zone. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone that is stationed in West Germany knows that you must have permission 
to be in the buffer zone and that it isn't often granted. It's not likely that 
he erred and went in by mistake. The whole zone is clearly marked," Dye said. 
</P>
<P>
When Peri returned late Saturday afternoon, he was wearing civilian clothes and 
carrying the portable computer. According to Dye, Peri just "walked up to the 
gate, identified himself and surrendered," saying nothing to military police as 
they took him into custody. 
</P>
<P>
The location of the jeep, which was found by military officials 2 days after 
its disappearance, and the absence of the computer had prompted Pentagon and 
Army investigators to speculate that Peri had defected to the Communist 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"We just don't know. We still don't know many of the details at this point. We 
still are not sure what he was doing with the computer or whether it had any 
sensitive information stored inside it," Dye said. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials in Washington had no comment on the case Monday. They 
referred all questions to investigators on the scene in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Peri's brother, Ken, and an aunt and uncle said Saturday that they were 
relieved that Peri had turned himself in and that he was in good condition. 
Family members refused to entertain any notion that he would have anything to 
do with entering a Communist Bloc country. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Peri's mother, Winnie, contacted at home early Monday evening, refused 
to comment about the charges her son faces. 
</P>
<P>
"We love our son, and we are trying to keep our lives as private as possible," 
Winnie Peri said. "We don't want to talk to a newspaper."

OCTD APPROVES PLAN FOR MONORAIL TO AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A developer's plan to build a privately financed monorail between John Wayne 
Airport and an Irvine office center received unanimous support Monday from 
Orange County Transit District board members. 
</P>
<P>
Transit agency board members praised McDonnell Douglas Realty Co., the firm 
that has offered to pay for the $3.5-million, half-mile monorail. It would link 
the company's 23-story twin office towers in Douglas Plaza with the new 
passenger terminal, which is due to open in April, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Board members said private financing for such facilities is welcome and 
necessary because government does not have the money to build them. 
</P>
<P>
Construction is expected to begin later this year. 
</P>
<P>
The vote came at the board's meeting Monday at OCTD headquarters in Garden 
Grove.

SANTA ANA COUNCIL OKS CABLE TV SETTLEMENT, REBATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TYLER L. CHIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Ana City Council late Monday ended a 15-month-old dispute with its 
cable television company, approving a settlement to give rebates that could 
affect about 26,000 customers throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
City council members voted 4 to 1 in a closed-door executive session to approve 
the settlement, which calls for Comcast Cablevision to credit current 
subscribers with the $4.45 monthly surcharge that was imposed last March. 
Councilwoman Patricia A. McGuigan opposed the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Cable TV Advisory Board had voted unanimously to reject the 
settlement, but City Atty. Edward J. Cooper argued that it would be 
prohibitively expensive -- costing up to $500,000 -- to pursue legal action 
against Comcast. 
</P>
<P>
Under the settlement, current Comcast subscribers will be reimbursed for the 
surcharge, which boosted the monthly rate from $13.50 to $17.95. It was imposed 
for services that the cable company was not providing but claimed that it would 
soon be required to under its franchise agreement with the city. The agreement 
does not require Comcast to reduce its rate. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement also calls for Comcast to pay the city more than $1 million. 
Councilman John Acosta said that no decision had been made on how the money 
would be spent. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement also releases the company from its obligations to equip a 
$2-million TV studio, reduces the number of linkages that Comcast has to make 
with other cable networks, and gives control of the city's local government 
channel, formerly KCTY, on Channel 3 in Santa Ana, to Comcast. 
</P>
<P>
"Subscribers will be receiving a refund for all this time we've been in 
litigation. . . . Now we can get back to televising council meetings," Acosta 
said. 
</P>
<P>
James Bequette, western region vice president for Comcast, said Monday that he 
would have to see a copy of the final agreement before he could comment on the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute between the city and Comcast began in December, 1987, when Santa 
Ana began fining Comcast $1,000 a day for its failure to live up to fulfill 
contract provisions.

NEW ENVIRONMENTAL STUDY WILL BE DONE ON TOLLWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The agency overseeing the planning for the Eastern tollway has agreed to 
conduct new noise and air-quality studies in the Peters Canyon area in order to 
settle a homeowners' lawsuit challenging the project. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in July by the Tustin Hills Homeowners Coalition, alleges that 
the environmental impact report approved by the County Board of Supervisors 
last year is inadequate because it does not detail homeowners' exposure to the 
expected increases in noise and air pollution once the tollway opens to 
traffic, in the mid to late 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
The Foothill-Eastern Transportation Corridor Agency, which is supervising the 
tollway project, and the homeowners group have accepted the terms of the 
settlement, but county officials are still processing the paper work and have 
not signed it, according to Donna Stubbs, spokeswoman for the corridor agency. 
The Board of Supervisors as well as the corridor agency was named a defendant 
in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the settlement, the county and corridor agency admit no 
wrongdoing but they do agree to pay for new noise and air-quality studies 
intended to compare existing noise- and air- pollution levels with those 
projected for after the tollway's opening, using worst-case traffic scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
Equipment to monitor noise and air pollution will be placed at several spots 
along the tollway route. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement also calls for studies to assess how the tollway will affect 
state and regional efforts to improve air quality. 
</P>
<P>
The Eastern tollway will connect the Riverside Freeway near the Orange 
County-Riverside County border with the Santa Ana Freeway at Jamboree Boulevard 
and at the interchange with the Laguna Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowner association leaders could not be reached for comment Monday.

DRIVER TRIED TO AVOID WOMAN, EXPERT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
An analysis of a videotape shows it was physically impossible for driver Danny 
David Ornelas to have intentionally hit a Newport Beach woman last Sept. 1, an 
expert witness testified Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Ted A. Mitchell, an automotive engineer with 18 years' experience analyzing and 
reconstructing automobile accidents, also told jurors at Ornelas' murder trial 
that he believes that the woman, Debbie Killelea, 37, herself contributed to 
her death by stepping into the path of the car. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she was the primary cause of it," Mitchell said of Killelea's death. 
That statement produced gasps from spectators in Orange County Superior Court 
in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell was the first defense witness to testify in the second-degree murder 
trial of Ornelas, 19, of Huntington Park. Ornelas is accused of having 
deliberately run down Killelea as she stood in an alley with her two sons 
behind their Balboa Peninsula home. 
</P>
<P>
A videotape of the seconds in the alley before Killelea was hit was made 
accidentally by a passenger in the car Ornelas was driving. Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Thomas Goethals has argued that the tape shows that Ornelas deliberately 
swerved to the right to hit Killelea as she tried to flee. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell testified that he believes that Ornelas only had time to react to 
Killelea's first movement, which was to the center of the alley. Mitchell 
testified that the videotape shows that as the car approached, Killelea tried 
to run to the wall where her two young sons were standing but that by then, the 
car had already turned and she was running into its path. 
</P>
<P>
A frame-by-frame analysis of the critical 2.67-second segment of the videotape 
shows that Ornelas veered right because the woman was moving toward the 
driver's left, Mitchell said. "The best decision for him (Ornelas) to make at 
that point is to move to the right," he told jurors. "That is what I would have 
done." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell noted that the videotape shows Killelea walking to the center of the 
20-foot-wide alley as Ornelas' car approached, putting her hands on her hips 
and facing the car in apparent disapproval of its speed in the alley. The final 
milliseconds of the tape show Killelea running back in the direction she came 
from. 
</P>
<P>
On a chart he showed to the jury, Mitchell said the sequence indicates that 
Killelea "jumped" into the center of the alley, that the driver saw her moving 
to his left, and that the driver therefore made a decision to veer to the 
right. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said the average reaction time for drivers in the United States is 1.5 
seconds. Mitchell said Ornelas had time to react only to Killelea's first 
action and that he was "prudent" in veering to the right as Killelea walked to 
his left. Mitchell added that Ornelas could not have known that Killelea would 
try to run back in the direction she came from. 
</P>
<P>
In a lengthy cross-examination, Goethals assailed Mitchell's testimony as being 
only a "hypothesis," and adding that Mitchell's statements tended to make 
Ornelas' actions in the alley sound "heroic." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Technique of Reconstruction 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell responded that he was only giving an expert opinion on what the 
videotape shows. "It's very obvious what his (Ornelas') intent was at the time 
he did so, and he could not have intended to have swerved at that woman," 
Mitchell said. "I mean, he would have had to be able to see into the future." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said he was able to link exact time and actions because the videotape 
has 30 frames per second. Using the individual frames as portions of a second, 
Mitchell said, he could pinpoint when Killelea walked to the center of the 
alley and when Ornelas' car veered. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell also testified that his calculations of the time and distance shown in 
the videotape indicate that Ornelas was driving about 40 m.p.h. through the 
alley and that he apparently braked just before he hit Killea and slowed to 
about 32 m.p.h. on impact. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell is a forensic automotive engineer based in Upland. He said he has a 
bachelor's degree in engineering from the General Motors Institute of 
Technology in Michigan and that he once held "the land speed record at the 
Bonneville (Utah) salt flats." 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by Goethals, Mitchell said his hourly fee is $250 and that he 
will earn about $5,000 overall for his work for Ornelas' attorney, Ralph 
Bencangey of Beverly Hills.

TRAKH'S WILDCATS REMAIN ON TRACK

<P>
Brea-Olinda High School, fresh off a 69-40 victory over Atascadero in the 
Southern Section 3-A title game Friday, faces the unknown tonight in the first 
round of the Division III Southern California Regionals. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats play host to Our Lady of Peace at 7:30 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know a thing about them," Brea Coach Mark Trakh said. 
</P>
<P>
Our Lady of Peace (19-6), of the San Diego Section, was the City Central League 
champion and is having its most successful season. 
</P>
<P>
Our Lady of Peace lost to University of San Diego High School in the section 
Division III semifinals. It was the first time the school had advanced to the 
section tournament, let alone to the state tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Its leading scorer, Tammy Tavares, is averaging 17.7 points but was held to 
just six in the loss to USDHS last week. 
</P>
<P>
The winner advances to the semifinals Thursday against Reedley (Central 
Section) or Ramona (San Diego). 
</P>
<P>
Brea would figure to have the upper hand against Our Lady of Peace. The 
Wildcats have won playoff games by 51, 46, seven and 29 points -- an average 
margin of victory of 33.3 points. 
</P>
<P>
While the 3-A title was nice, Trakh has turned the Wildcats' attention toward a 
state championship. 
</P>
<P>
"We've won 3-A titles before," he said. "We've never won a state title. That 
would be the goal now. I think it's always been our goal." 
</P>
<P>
Guard Aimee McDaniel, who had 25 points in the 3-A final, has been hot in the 
playoffs and averages 15.3 points a game to lead the team. 
</P>
<P>
Jody Anton, Tammy Blackburn, Cindy Gunn and Jinelle Williams, Brea's other 
starters, have contributed solid games in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids have been consistent all year," Trakh said. "Balance is the key. 
That's what happened in the Atascadero game. Everybody contributed."

TRABUCO HILLS TAKES ON SAN DIEGO CLAIREMONT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE LOWERY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Any concerns Rainer Wulf had about his Trabuco Hills High School team 
experiencing a lull between winning the 3-A boys' basketball championship 
Saturday and starting the Division III Southern California Regionals tonight, 
were immediately laid to rest in Saturday's post-championship locker room. 
</P>
<P>
"The minute they got in there it was, 'All right, who's next? "' Wulf said. "I 
know there are people who think of the state tournament as anticlimactic, but 
my kids were really pumped. They wanted to know if we won the state 
(championship) did we go on to the nationals?" 
</P>
<P>
Sorry, but Oakland -- site of the state finals -- is as good as it gets. 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills starts down that road with a first-round game against San Diego 
Clairemont. Trabuco Hills (22-6) has several advantages. It's the home team in 
tonight's 7:30 game, though it moved the site to nearby El Toro High for 
seating capacity considerations. 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills is seeded No. 2 -- San Diego Lincoln is No. 1 -- and Clairemont 
is 12-16 and lost its sectional championship game to Lincoln, 89-59. 
</P>
<P>
On such short notice -- the state pairings were announced Sunday -- teams have 
very little time to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had to depend on talking to people who have seen them play," Wulf said. 
</P>
<P>
What Wulf has heard is that Clairemont runs a lot of stuff from John Wooden's 
days at UCLA. That's not surprising when you consider that the Clairemont coach 
is Greg Lee, who played for Wooden from 1972 to 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Lee uses Wooden's 2-2-1 full-court press, and high-post offense. Guard Ray 
McDavid is averaging 25 points and has had more than 40 points in two games. In 
one of those games, McDavid made 10 three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, I'm less concerned with what they'll do than what we're going to do," 
Wulf said. 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills, which depended on 6-foot-10 center Rick Swanwick for offense 
throughout the season -- he averaged 20 points -- showed in its 3-A final, a 
59-55 victory over Corona del Mar, that others can pick up the slack. Swanwick 
had only nine points in the final, but four guards -- Randy Kriech (19), Chad 
Poulos (14), Luis Arenado (eight) and Tim Manning (seven) -- combined for 48 
points to lead Trabuco Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're still improving as far as the whole team concept," Wulf said. 
</P>
<P>
Tulare Western (9-16) vs. Corona del Mar (19-10) at Corona del Mar High: One 
way to get over losing a Southern Section championship game, as Corona del Mar 
did Saturday, is to be given a first-round regional opponent such as Western, 
which has the worst record of any team in the five state divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Western lost to LeMoore in its sectional title game by 30-plus points. Western 
does have a couple of good players in 6-3 forward Marvin Coleman, averaging 14 
points and 10 rebounds, and 5-9 guard LeRohn Dodson, who is averaging 13 points 
and 3.2 steals per game. Dodson has made 32 three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar's strength comes from its man defense. During a 24-game regular 
season, Corona del Mar held eight opponents to 48 points or less.

WHITTIER CHRISTIAN TO PLAY SAN DIEGO CORONADO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whittier Christian High School, after winning the Southern Section 2-AA 
basketball championship Saturday, enters the Southern California Regionals 
today as the third-seeded team in Division IV. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier Christian (22-6) will play San Diego Coronado (11-14) at La Habra High 
School in a first-round game tonight at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier Christian, led by 6-foot-7 center Scott Ferguson (19 points and 11 
rebounds a game) and 6-4 forward Paul McKinley (21 points, 9 rebounds), may not 
have too great a challenge in Coronado, the only team in the division playoffs 
with a losing record. Derek Wastila, a 6-5 junior center, leads Coronado with 
14 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Wastila is supported by 5-6 guard Tim DeWitt, 6-3 forward Jesse MacNeill and 
6-2 guard Tom Mitchell, who was the San Diego Section player of the year in 
water polo last fall. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're facing these unknown teams, you are always a little hesitant in 
what to say to the kids," Whittier Christian Coach Bob Brown said. "But I feel 
good. I feel we got a real good seeding for the first round." 
</P>
<P>
In other Division IV play: 
</P>
<P>
Orange Lutheran (23-4) vs. El Cajon Christian (14-11) at Granite Hills High: 
Orange Lutheran, which defeated Whittier Christian twice en route to the 
Olympic League title this season, qualified for the regionals as an at-large 
entry after losing, 78-54, to 2-A champion Santa Clara Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Lutheran, coming off its worse performance of the season Saturday when 
it shot just 32% from the field after averaging 55% all season, will meet a 
good shooting team. 
</P>
<P>
 El Cajon Christian, which defeated Coronado, 70-60, Saturday for the section 
Division IV title, is especially capable at the free throw line. Saturday it 
converted 21 of 22 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Its top player, 6-1 guard David Jeremiah, is a three-year starter who averages 
21.6 points. In one game this season, he made 10 three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
Darrell White, a 6-5 senior forward, averages 20 points for Coronado. Other 
starters are 6-3 forward Tim Barkett, 6-foot junior guard Brad Fox and 6-10, 
215-pound center Dan Tate. 
</P>
<P>
Tate, though intimidating in size, rarely scores in double figures. He scored 
just two points in Saturday's victory.

SCC TAKES ON BIOLA IN DISTRICT 3 FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only one team stands between Southern California College and a trip to Kansas 
City for the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics championship 
basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
But what a team and what a program. 
</P>
<P>
The Vanguards (28-3) play Biola College tonight at 7:30 at Whittier College in 
the final of the NAIA District 3 playoffs. Not too big a chore, considering the 
Eagles have won the District 3 championship five times in the last nine years. 
</P>
<P>
Although Biola has never won the national championship, it did reach the final 
in 1982 only to lose to the University of South Carolina at Spartanburg. The 
Eagles were 39-1 that season. 
</P>
<P>
"We managed to make it to the finals (of the district playoffs) in 1982 and 
were annihilated by Biola," Southern California Coach Bill Reynolds said. "They 
are definitely the team in our district that has the Kansas City-bound 
tradition." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe so, but Southern California is the district's top-seeded team. 
</P>
<P>
The Vanguards reached the final by routing Cal Baptist, 79-61, Saturday. The 
same night, Biola slipped past Westmont, 78-76. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a paradox, we're the No. 1 team, but everyone is talking like Biola is 
the favorite," Reynolds said. "I guess it's the tradition people remember." 
</P>
<P>
People might also remember that the Vanguards have beaten Biola twice this 
season, including a 90-83 victory two weeks ago in a nonconference game at 
Southern California College. 
</P>
<P>
A third victory would send Reynolds' team to Kansas City for the 32-team 
national tournament, March 14-20. 
</P>
<P>
Biola (28-5) has struggled with consistency and injuries throughout the season. 
In fact, the Eagles will have only seven players in uniform tonight as they 
will be without 6-foot-7 forward Todd Morrison and 6-8 1/2 center John Stiver.

Morrison tore cartilage in his knee on Friday, and against Westmont, Stiver 
reinjured an ankle that had already been operated on twice this year. Stiver 
was a starter and Morrison was the first forward off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
But even without those two, the Eagles have plenty of size. Ed Johansen (6-9) 
starts at center with Paul Horn (6-7) and Kevin Hood (6-6) at forwards. 
</P>
<P>
After 6-7 center Jeff Bickmore, the Vanguards' next tallest starter is 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
"This will definitely be a game of contrasting styles," Reynolds said.

<P>
MAYNE TO TAKE YEAR OFF FROM COACHING OCC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange Coast College baseball Coach Mike Mayne said Monday he will take a break 
from coaching after this season but will remain on staff as a physical 
education instructor. 
</P>
<P>
Mayne, now in his 13th year, plans to return to Orange Coast for the 1991 
season, but also will explore the possibilities of working as an assistant with 
a four-year college or professional organization while away from his OCC 
coaching duties. 
</P>
<P>
Mayne cited several reasons for his decision, including the recent illness of 
his wife, Patricia. She suffered a stroke last August. 
</P>
<P>
Her condition has improved, but she will not be returning to her job as a 
teacher at Huntington Beach High School. 
</P>
<P>
"I almost lost her, but she fought through it," said Mayne, who made his 
decision three weeks ago. "When things like that happen, it makes you step back 
and take a look at what you're doing. . . . I only know one way to run any 
program. It has to be an obsession, a passion. You have to be with it all the 
time. That's the only way I know how to do it and make it successful." 
</P>
<P>
It's not official yet, but OCC assistant Scott Groot is expected to take over 
the team next spring, according to Mayne, who will continue to oversee the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Mayne first thought of taking a break after the 1987 season, when OCC finished 
third in the state and his son, Brent, played for him as a freshman. Brent 
Mayne transferred to Cal State Fullerton in 1988 and is now considered one of 
the nation's top college catchers. 
</P>
<P>
"I should have done it then," Mike Mayne said. "I just couldn't make up my mind 
in time. It isn't the players or the coaching, there are a lot of other things 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
Mayne began at OCC in 1977 and has a 324-144 record coming into this season. 
OCC is 10-4-1 overall this season, but the Pirates are off to an 0-3 start in 
the Orange Empire Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Mayne, 42, won conference titles at OCC in 1980, '81, '82, '84, '86 and '87. 
Mayne's 1980 team also won the state title. 
</P>
<P>
Mayne went to Madison High School in San Diego, then played baseball at UC 
Riverside. His first coaching job was at Eisenhower High School in 1973. He was 
at Eisenhower four years and had an 89-21 record and three league titles. 
</P>
<P>
Streaking Cypress: Bobby Thome, a sophomore outfielder at Cypress, currently 
has a 15-game hitting streak. He is hitting .317. Cypress is hitting .329 as a 
team with 25 home runs. Steve Gill leads with seven home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Scott Pickler figured his team would hit, but what concerns him now, as 
it has all season, is the lack of defense. Cypress has made 33 errors in 18 
games. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in three years, the state men's basketball tournament will 
not have an Orange County team participating. 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos (28-4), Santa Monica (32-3), Mt. San Jacinto (29-6) and defending 
state champion El Camino (23-8) will represent the South in the eight-team 
tournament, which begins Thursday at the University of Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
In the first round: Cerritos plays Columbia (27-6) at 3 p.m.; Santa Monica 
plays City College of San Francisco (25-9) at 5; Mt. San Jacinto plays Chabot 
(26-5) at 7 and El Camino plays Skyline (27-6) at 9. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress reached the tournament last spring but lost in the semifinals. 
Saddleback and Rancho Santiago reached the final eight in 1987. Saddleback 
defeated Rancho Santiago in one semifinal, but Ventura defeated Saddleback for 
the title. 
</P>
<P>
Community College Notes 
</P>
<P>
Mike Taylor has taken over as defensive coordinator at Orange Coast College. 
Taylor, a linebacker coach the last three seasons, replaces Barry Waters, who 
resigned. . . . Rob Bailey of Fullerton has 21 steals in 22 attempts in 14 
games this season. The Fullerton single-season record is 38 set by Randy Thomas 
in 1966. . . . Jody Fee of OCC has signed a national letter of intent to play 
volleyball at Cal Poly Pomona next fall. Fee, from Orange High School, was an 
All-Orange Empire Conference player the last two seasons. Sue Guest of 
Fullerton has signed a letter of intent to play volleyball at Cal State 
Fullerton next spring. Guest, who went to Troy High School, transferred from 
Washington State to Fullerton last fall. . . . Kelli McKinney of the Fullerton 
men's basketball team set a school-career record for steals with 192. . . . 
Kristi Van Voorhis, daughter of Dick Van Voorhis, Cypress athletic director and 
men's tennis coach, made her acting debut as a waitress in "thirtysomething" 
last week. . . . Last Thursday's rained out baseball games will be made up 
Wednesday at the same times and locations.

NEWPORT PHARMACEUTICALS POSTS LOSS FOR 1988, CITES COST OF TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Newport Pharmaceuticals International Inc., a diversified health care company 
in Newport Beach, reported a loss of $4.96 million for 1988, which it 
attributed almost entirely to the cost of tests aimed at proving the 
effectiveness of Isoprinosine in the treatment of pre-AIDS conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The company reported revenue of $31 million for the year. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the company said, it invested over $4.1 million in research and 
development to complete tests of Isoprinosine in the United States and United 
Kingdom. Last November the company said the results of these clinical trials 
failed to show the drug was effective in combatting pre-AIDS conditions. 
</P>
<P>
In January, however, Leo Pharmaceutical Products, the company's licensee in 
Denmark, said that a preliminary analysis of the results of Scandinavian tests 
was promising. Newport Pharmaceuticals said that upon further analysis of the 
results, it will determine whether to seek approval from the Food and Drug 
Administration to market Isoprinosine in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Smith, Newport Pharmaceuticals' senior vice president of finance, said 
the firm did not have financial figures for a comparable reporting period in 
1987 because the company moved the end of its fiscal year from April 30 to Dec. 
31. 
</P>
<P>
The company reported a loss of $2.4 million on revenue of $18.1 million for the 
eight months ended Dec. 31, 1987. LESLIE BERKMAN

PACIFIC RANCH MARKETS EXPANDS BY ADDING IRVINE RANCH STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN GALANTE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pacific Ranch Markets has signed an agreement to take over the Irvine Ranch 
Farmers Market in Orange -- leaving only one grocery store in the county still 
operating under the Irvine Ranch name. 
</P>
<P>
Effective March 13, Santa Ana-based Pacific Ranch Markets will begin operating 
the 21,000-square-foot store at Newport and Chapman avenues, said Dan Parker, 
president of Tri Pacific Commercial Brokerage Inc., which represents Pacific 
Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange store will be Pacific Ranch Markets' third grocery store in Orange 
County. There is a second Pacific Ranch store in Laguna Niguel. The chain also 
operates the former Irvine Ranch Farmers Market in Newport Beach under the name 
Farmers Market at Atrium Court. Another Pacific Ranch Market operates in Corona 
del Mar, but it is under different, independent ownership. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Ranch chain -- which once operated 12 stores, seven of them in 
Orange County -- filed for bankruptcy protection in 1988. Late last year, Tribu 
Inc., the parent of Chalet Gourmet in Los Angeles, bought Irvine Ranch's stock 
and took control of the ailing chain. 
</P>
<P>
It now appears that the Tribu and Chalet Gourmet investor group will soon be 
operating only two of the original Irvine Ranch markets. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the original Irvine Ranch stores -- in Mission Viejo, Yorba Linda and 
Northridge -- have closed their doors since the bankruptcy filing. The owners 
of Chalet Gourmet have sold the Costa Mesa and Tustin stores, which are now 
operating under other names. A store in Texas has closed and another in San 
Diego is now being operated under a different name by the Hahn Co. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, that leaves the Irvine Ranch store in Irvine, which is still 
operating, and a store in Brea that never opened. 
</P>
<P>
Parker of Tri Pacific said Monday that his firm has submitted offers to lease 
the Irvine and Brea sites. The offers were by two different operators, neither 
of them Pacific Ranch Markets, Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
Chalet Gourmet and its affiliates, meanwhile, are still operating the Irvine 
Ranch stores at the Beverly Center and in Woodland Hills. A spokesman for 
Chalet Gourmet, Irwin N. Gold, said Monday that the investor group "definitely 
will keep" those two stores. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jon Hubbard, founder of the Irvine Ranch chain, last month filed for 
personal bankruptcy and has become the manager of the Costa Mesa store, now 
called the Original Irvine Ranch Market.

A LITTLE PRETENSION TO TAKE ITS TOLL OF THE COACH HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DUNCAN STRAUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Among the inescapable conclusions drawn from the Toll's concert Sunday at 
Bogart's in Long Beach: What a difference a few states make. 
</P>
<P>
Go to a show within the Ohio quartet's Midwest stronghold -- say, Michigan -- 
and the turnout is a fire marshal's nightmare, people speak of the group in 
absolutely reverential terms and there's a palpable buzz surrounding its debut 
release, "The Price of Progression." 
</P>
<P>
Out here, most folks haven't heard of the Toll -- much less heard its music -- 
which probably helps explain why the group's local debut at Bogart's drew maybe 
50 people. Of course that might be expected in an area in which these guys have 
never toured, especially when they released a 10-minute song for the first 
single, effectively locking themselves out of much radio air play or video eye 
play. 
</P>
<P>
But, actually, that epic is a representative calling card not only because two 
other "Price" songs clock in over 10 minutes, but also because these rather 
humorless chaps are often way over the top -- for better and worse. Or, as a 
dark-haired chap put it Sunday a few songs into the Toll's 80-minute set: "A 
little pretentious, but cool." 
</P>
<P>
Some Toll-watchers will be even less forgiving. But each person's decision to 
embrace or dismiss the band (which plays the Coach House tonight and Club 
Lingerie on Thursday) will probably hinge on the reaction to those long pieces 
and/or the performances of singer-front man Brad Circone, who improvises -- 
over huge, guitar-driven, anthem-like passages -- different narratives and 
lyrics, ranging from the effects of a Catholic upbringing to the mind-set of a 
middle-aged woman trapped in a unfulfilling, decaying marriage. 
</P>
<P>
And then there are his pumped-up stage antics, which on Sunday included turning 
a flip and, with no warning, falling onto the dance floor. The Toll won't be 
everyone's cup of sonic tea. But with the showy theatrics, the nightly 
tightrope act of verbal improvisations and what Bono calls "a big sound," this 
is clearly an arena-rock band waiting to happen. With enough touring -- and 
some shorter singles -- it probably will. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toll, Ann De Jarnett and Imagining Yellow Suns play tonight at 8 at the 
Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $8 to $10. 
Information: (714) 496-8930.

A car bomb exploded near the American University Hospital in Muslim West Beirut 
today, killing two women and wounding 21, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Druze warlord Walid Jumblatt, a staunch ally of the Syrians who police West 
Beirut, blamed the Christian Cabinet of Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun for the blast. 
The explosive-laden yellow Fiat blew up in front of a fruit and vegetable stall 
at an intersection off a main commercial thoroughfare. Jumblatt charged at a 
news conference that the bomb was part of a campaign by the Christian Cabinet 
to choke private militias in Lebanon.

The Santa Ana City Council unanimously approved on Monday night a no-stopping 
zone for a stretch of Harbor Boulevard to discourage men from pulling over to 
hire prostitutes. The rule will be in effect from 4 p.m. to 9 a.m. from 
Westminster Avenue to Warner Avenue. Violators can be fined $30. The vote also 
provides about $6,000 for 80 no-stopping signs, which will be installed March 
15, said Ruth Smith, an engineer with the city's Public Works Agency. The city 
probably will allow a 10-day grace period after that, she said. A Superior 
Court judge denied a controversial request last month by the city to declare 
prostitutes a public nuisance and bar them from the boulevard.

IRA gunmen shot and killed three men at a Northern Ireland parking garage 
today, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish Republican Army said it attacked the garage in the County Tyrone 
village of Coagh because it is a local stronghold for the Ulster Volunteer 
Force, an outlawed Protestant paramilitary group. The Rev. William McCrea, the 
local unionist member of Parliament, said, "The gunmen opened fire from a 
passing car. After doing their job, they cheered as they drove away."

PILOTS' SLOWDOWN FIZZLES; BUSH VOWS NO INTERVENTION; 
</P>
<P>
EASTERN SENDS 2,500 MORE HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Threats that the air travel system would be clogged nationwide by pilots 
painstakingly working by the rules fizzled today as Eastern Airlines sent 2,500 
more workers home, blaming pilots for leaving it with "no business on the 
books" in the fourth day of a machinists' strike. 
</P>
<P>
The pilots union had asked its 40,000 members to follow rule books stringently 
today, and there were fears of havoc as delays piggybacked around the country. 
But while the union said two-thirds of its members followed the directive, 
delays were few. 
</P>
<P>
"The reports we have are that there has been no effect on operations," said 
Capt. Roger Hall, spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The union contended that its action was not a slowdown but an effort to ensure 
safety during the strike. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush in Washington said pilots should not "make the innocent 
traveling public a pawn" and he stood by his opposition to government 
intervention to stop the walkout by the 8,500-member machinists union, which 
represents mechanics and ramp service workers. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that if the machinists try to shut down rail service he will ask 
Congress to ban such secondary boycotts. He said the strike should be settled 
through bargaining, but no talks have been scheduled since the strike began 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, a federal judge today extended until Friday a restraining order 
barring rail workers from staging secondary strikes in sympathy with the 
Eastern strikers. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Robert Patterson had ruled Sunday in favor of three New 
York area railroads, which carry about 320,000 commuters into New York daily, 
who were concerned that their employees would honor secondary pickets. 
</P>
<P>
The Eastern strike, the culmination of a 17-month labor dispute, nearly 
grounded the airline, stranded thousands of passengers and pushed the nation's 
seventh-largest airline to the brink of collapse. The airline wants $150 
million in concessions; the machinists want $50 million in raises. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern has said it lost more than $1 billion this decade and is losing $1 
million a day. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly that has gotten worse," Joe Leonard, Eastern executive vice president 
said at a briefing announcing the layoffs of 2,500 more people. 
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday's layoffs ended up hitting almost 7,000 innocent employees, rather 
than the 5,000 we announced earlier," he said. "With no pilots, we are running 
4% of our normal flight schedule. Economic realities forced by this 4% schedule 
simply wipe out 9,500 jobs for people who want to work." 
</P>
<P>
Just 1,500 employees are working, down from 31,200 before the strike, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We simply don't have any business on the books today," Leonard said. "Our 
competitors have simply been sucking up the traffic, our traffic, since March 
4." 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a very strong possibility that Eastern Airlines as we knew it 
last week will never come back. It's very wounded," Leonard said. 
</P>
<P>
Some union members have speculated that Eastern's owner, Texas Air Corp., and 
its chairman, Frank Lorenzo, are trying to tear the carrier apart.

A social worker pulled out of the race against Councilman Ernani Bernardi today 
and endorsed the councilman's leading challenger, firefighter and community 
activist Lyle Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Yanez, 28, a county psychiatric social worker who lives in Sylmar, said 
he dropped his challenge to Bernardi because it became obvious "that Lyle Hall 
is going to be the next councilman of the 7th District." 
</P>
<P>
Yanez said he endorsed Hall because he was more responsive to community needs. 
Bernardi has neglected some neighborhoods and has not helped residents campaign 
against development, Yanez told a City Hall news conference. Bernardi was 
attending a City Council meeting and was not immediately available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Yanez said he believed that Hall can beat Bernardi. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I had a chance, but I think his chance is better," Yanez said of 
Hall.

NEW TOWER INVESTIGATION UNVEILED;

NUNN PROBES LATEST DRINKING ALLEGATIONS; GOP OBJECTS

<P>
The Democratic chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee said today that 
he has directed staff from another committee to investigate new allegations of 
excessive drinking against John Tower, an unusual move that quickly raised 
protests from Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
The partisan squabble erupted as President Bush once again defended his 
embattled defense nominee, saying there would be "25,000 people in the 
Pentagon" making sure Tower stands by his no-drinking pledge. Senate Democratic 
leader George J. Mitchell, meanwhile, conceded there may be further Democratic 
defections but insisted that the GOP will not have enough votes to win Tower's 
confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Led Fight 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), the Armed Services Committee chairman who has led the 
fight against Tower, said the new allegations concerned Tower's alcohol 
consumption, a subject that was exhaustively investigated during committee 
hearings. "The time frame is from the '70s until recently," Nunn said. 
</P>
<P>
"Why are we still investigating Sen. Tower?" Republican leader Bob Dole of 
Kansas asked on the Senate floor. "Isn't the FBI report adequate? When does the 
investigation stop?" 
</P>
<P>
Dole disclosed details of the separate investigation at the start of the fourth 
day of Senate debate on the troubled nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans face what they concede is an uphill battle to win Senate 
confirmation for Tower, who has been dogged by allegations of excessive 
drinking, womanizing and questions about his ties to defense contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said that despite the decision Monday by Sen. Howell Heflin (D-Ala.) 
to back Tower, the nomination will be defeated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Nomination Will Be Rejected' 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that when the vote is taken, the nomination will be rejected. I do not 
believe there are sufficient votes to result in the confirmation of Sen. 
Tower," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, meanwhile, repeated his support for Tower and termed the nominee's pledge 
to swear off alcohol if confirmed by the Senate as a "fail-safe guarantee." 
</P>
<P>
"I think he'll measure up to that qualification. Indeed, he has said he'll 
never touch another drop of liquor and you'll have 25,000 people in the 
Pentagon making sure that's true," Bush told an impromptu White House news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
Dole left open the possibility of asking the Senate to agree to allow Tower to 
answer the charges against him on the floor itself, but in his remarks, the GOP 
leader made the surprise announcement of the separate investigation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Charges 
</P>
<P>
Dole said he had been told that investigators from the Senate Permanent 
Subcommittee on Investigations had traveled to Texas last weekend to look into 
new charges against Tower. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn acknowledged that he directed staff members of the subcommittee, which he 
chairs, to check the new allegations, and defended his actions, saying that he 
had been told by the FBI that it was no longer investigating charges against 
Tower.

Hundreds of police and security guards held back vengeful relatives today as a 
confessed North Korean agent went on trial for the bombing of a South Korean 
airliner that killed 115 people. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here to kill you!" shouted one person. "Bring back my husband!" another 
screamed at Kim Hyon Hui as security agents led her into the courtroom. She 
buried her face in her hands and sobbed as relatives of victims reduced the 
courtroom to bedlam, shouting insults and trying to get through a police cordon 
to attack her. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1988, she admitted on South Korean television that she planted a 
bomb disguised as a radio and liquor on the Boeing 707 in November, 1987, to 
disrupt last summer's Olympic Games in Seoul. She also told the court today she 
had been a North Korean agent.

The Soviet media gave Raisa Gorbachev some rare coverage today, carrying a 
report on the Kremlin first lady's comments on her husband's reforms and how 
the world's women have improved prospects for peace. 
</P>
<P>
"If people currently are more confident of a peaceful future, we know that much 
of the credit goes to women actively working on all continents for friendship, 
cooperation and profound mutual understanding of nations," Raisa Gorbachev said 
at a reception she gave Monday in honor of International Women's Day, a Soviet 
holiday that will be celebrated Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Although she is shown frequently on Soviet state-run television and has been 
interviewed by Western reporters, her views are rarely reported in Soviet media 
or heard by her fellow citizens.

Rep. Charles B. Rangel, chairman of the House Select Committee on Narcotics,

priority in the nation's foreign policy and has sown confusion among South 
American leaders.

Fresh from a meeting in Ecuador with more than 200 officials from five Andean

Iran severed relations with Britain today over the Salman Rushdie affair, 
buttressing the position of fundamentalist clerics in Tehran and dashing hopes 
for an early release of British hostages in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Ministry attacked Britain for failing to denounce Rushdie 
and his novel, "The Satanic Verses," a book judged so blasphemous to Islam by 
the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini that he condemned the writer to death. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past two centuries Britain has been in the front line of plots and 
treachery against Islam and Muslims," the ministry said in a statement 
announcing the break. 
</P>
<P>
A British spokesman said the crisis was entirely Iran's fault. "Incitement to 
murder is a violation of the most elementary principles and obligations that 
govern relations between sovereign states," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lift Death Order 
</P>
<P>
British leaders, while acknowledging that the book is offensive to Muslims, 
have demanded that Khomeini lift his death order against the 41-year-old 
British author and his publishers, Viking Penguin. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, in Vienna for East-West arms 
control talks, regretted the Iranian decision. 
</P>
<P>
"When such a thing happens, I can only express regret," he told reporters, 
adding that Moscow will not attempt to take advantage of the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie, born into an Indian Muslim family in Bombay, has remained in hiding 
under police protection since Khomeini first ordered his death on Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives of British hostages in Lebanon said the break in relations dashed 
hopes for their freedom. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Setback for Us' 
</P>
<P>
"This is undoubtedly a setback for us and other families who were hoping for an 
early release," said John Waite, cousin of kidnaped Anglican church envoy Terry 
Waite. 
</P>
<P>
Waite disappeared on a hostage freedom mission in Beirut in 1987. Two other 
Britons, Belfast teacher Brian Keenan and television journalist John McCarthy, 
disappeared within six days of each other in April, 1986.

PRODUCTIVITY INCHES UP; LABOR COSTS SOAR

U.S. workers' productivity edged up at a tiny annual rate of 0.1% from October 
through December while unit labor costs, a major inflation measure for 
business, shot up 5.6%, the government reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The 0.1% rise in non-farm business productivity, output per hour worked, 
continued a sawtooth pattern in effect for all of last year with a strong gain 
in one quarter followed by a poor showing in the next quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Productivity had risen at an annual rate of 3.4% in the first quarter of 1988 
only to fall at a rate of 2.4% in the second quarter. It then rose at a 2% rate 
in the July-September quarter only to slow to the minuscule 0.1% advance in the 
final three months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Of particular concern to economists were signs that tight labor markets and 
high factory operating rates are beginning to show up in inflationary 
pressures. 
</P>
<P>
Unit labor costs, which reflect changes in hourly compensation as well as 
changes in productivity, rose at an annual rate of 5.6% in the fourth quarter, 
almost double the 3.7% rate of increase in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
It was the biggest increase in unit labor costs since a 6.8% rise in the second 
quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan cited the sharp escalation of unit 
labor costs as one factor behind the central bank's recent anti-inflation 
moves. The Fed is hoping that by pushing up interest rates it will dampen 
demand enough to cool an overheated economy and prevent an inflationary 
wage-price spiral from taking hold.

Demand for oil in the non-communist world is expected to hit its highest level 
in a decade this year, according to the Energy Information Agency, and industry 
analysts say Asia's thirst for energy is the chief factor. 
</P>
<P>
"The Asia Pacific Rim is the engine of growth for world oil demand," said 
Edward Krapels, president of Energy Securities Analysis Inc. "It is the 
strongest growing region." 
</P>
<P>
The region, which includes Japan and Australia as well as the fast-growing 
economies of South Korea and Thailand, consumed about 7.1 million barrels of 
oil a day in 1988, about 7% more than in 1987, according to Helen Gallagher, an 
economist with Caltex Petroleum Corp.

Vice President Dan Quayle, chairman of the National Space Council, has found 
money to save two crucial environmental satellites from being shut down March 
31, his office said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Landsat satellites beam data and images to 14 ground stations worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle and Mark Albrecht, executive secretary of the space council, met with 
the primary users of the satellites on Monday, said Liz Murphy, a spokeswoman 
for the vice president. Murphy said the users will provide money while the 
panel evaluates the future of the program, but she added, "We don't have a 
dollar amount." 
</P>
<P>
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which needs $9.4 million 
to keep Landsat 4 and Landsat 5 operating through the end of the fiscal year in 
September, ordered the satellites shut down last Wednesday.

TAX INCREASE NEEDED TO CUT BACK DEFICIT, REP. ROSTENKOWSKI ARGUES

Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, head of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, argued 
today that a tax increase would be needed to cut the deficit and he questioned 
President Bush's plan to freeze, rather than reduce, the defense budget. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing with Richard G. Darman, the Administration's budget director, 
Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) said he believes that Bush's budget plan -- which would 
not raise taxes but would cut a variety of domestic programs -- is "not 
politically realistic." 
</P>
<P>
"When I total all these cuts, the defense budget has not been cut at all and 
there are domestic cuts of $20 billion," Rostenkowski said. 
</P>
<P>
"Once again, I think a revenue component is going to have to be part" of any 
budget agreement between Congress and the White House, Rostenkowski said. "I 
think the Administration ought to think very seriously about its stand in 
cement on revenue." 
</P>
<P>
Darman showed no indication that the President plans to back away from his 
campaign pledge to not raise taxes. Bush, however, has indicated that he may 
support some new revenues, as long as they could be considered as "user fees."

</P>
<P>
Owens is free on $265 bail after being arrested Monday on the complaint filed

UNR coach Len Stevens announced the indefinite suspension at a news conference, 
praising Owens' leadership but saying he could not be an exception because of 
his basketball talents.

The incident involving the woman allegedly occurred in the Stead area north of 
Reno and while few details are available, university spokesman Bob Gabrielli 
said the woman was not injured.

Owens is averaging 22.7 points a game this year to lead the Big Sky by a

Any chance Braves slugger Dale Murphy would be traded to San Diego has been 
killed by Atlanta General Manager Bobby Cox, who decided the available Padres 
players are "not what we're looking for." Cox made the decision after reviewing 
a report by Braves scout Wes Westrum, who spent the past week evaluating Padres 
talent at San Diego's spring training camp in Yuma. Although Cox declined to be 
specific, the report apparently singled out catcher Sandy Alomar Jr., pitcher 
Greg Harris and outfielder John Kruk as the top three Padres trade prospects. 
But Cox decided they weren't enough to pry Murphy loose from Atlanta.

Padres Manager Jack McKeon said his optimism about the potential deal waned as 
the talks that began in December bogged down in recent weeks. He downplayed the 
significance of the breakdown in discussions.
