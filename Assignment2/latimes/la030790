WHITE ENROLLMENT DROPS AGAIN, NEW CENSUS SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The latest ethnic census of students in the San Diego Unified School District 
shows the number of whites continues to decline, dropping to 39% this year from 
41.4% a year ago and from 43% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Latino enrollment continues to show large increases, rising to 25.6% from 23.2% 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Black enrollment remained steady at 16.2%, Filipino enrollment remained at 8% 
and Indochinese enrollment rose to 7.7% from 7.6% a year ago, the report 
indicates. 
</P>
<P>
The latest figures continue a trend that has seen white enrollment decline from 
more than 80,000 students in 1976 to 46,000, while minority enrollment has 
increased from 41,000 to 72,000. 
</P>
<P>
Total district enrollment is 118,600 students, now exceeding 1976 levels, after 
having dropped to fewer than 110,000 students in the early 1980s. White 
enrollment is even smaller in the district's 107 elementary schools, at 37.8%. 
The drop compounds district problems in maintaining integration programs and 
puts greater pressure on administrators to boost achievement of Latino and 
black students, who lag behind Asian and white students. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the county, 57% of all students are white, 23.2% Latino, 8.3% black, 
5% Filipino and 4.9% Indochinese. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego city schools trustees Tuesday asked Supt. Tom Payzant for additional 
data on whether white enrollment is dropping proportionately to school 
population growth in the northern areas of the city, which are covered by the 
suburban San Dieguito and Poway school districts.

FAKE OIL SPILL TO TEST RESPONSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the wake of the Long Beach oil spill, Coast Guard officials have decided to 
stage a 5-hour drill Thursday in San Diego waters to test the local response to 
a similar event. 
</P>
<P>
For the drill, scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. near the entrance to San Diego Bay, 
the Coast Guard will team with the Navy and an industry-supported spill 
clean-up group called Clean Coastal Waters. 
</P>
<P>
The groups will deploy oil containment booms and skimming equipment in response 
to a simulated spill of fuel oil spewing from an imaginary boat grounded near 
the Zuniga jetty. 
</P>
<P>
Officials will evaluate the groups' response, how effectively they communicate 
with one another, and how efficiently they use the equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"We will test the people and the equipment to see how well the response 
community will be able to work in case there were a spill here," said Coast 
Guard Lt. Stephen LaLonde.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: REPORTS OF TOXIC LEAKS FORCE 2 EVACUATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two small commercial areas of the northeast San Fernando Valley were evacuated 
briefly Tuesday when hazardous materials leaks were reported, the Los Angeles 
Fire Department said. 
</P>
<P>
A small vat containing trichloroethane overheated and caught fire about 1 p.m. 
at Anthony Manufacturing in the 12300 block of Montero Avenue in Pacoima, 
Firefighter Pat Marek said. 
</P>
<P>
Marek said nearby businesses were evacuated as a precaution for about an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, a hazardous-materials team was sent to an out of business 
metal-plating company in Sun Valley where chemicals were reported to be leaking 
from a steel drum. Marek said the report came from workers cleaning up 
All-American Plating, in the 7100 block of Vineland Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
A small area of nearby businesses was evacuated after the leak was reported at 
10:35 a.m., but no indication of a leak was found, Marek said.

SCHOOL OFFICIALS UPDATING BUILDING PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new elementary school near downtown San Diego, a new primary school in Barrio 
Logan, and classroom additions at San Diego and Morse high schools -- all to 
relieve overcrowding -- would be added to the long-range building program under 
revisions presented Tuesday to the San Diego city schools board. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators unveiled the proposed 1990-91 update of their master plan during 
the first of at least three weeks of public hearings over how to set priorities 
through 2000, given that the district estimates it is at least $80 million 
short of money needed to carry out all its plans, which total $402 million. 
</P>
<P>
The new schools and additions would cost almost $30 million, on top of projects 
already listed on previous master plans. They would be part of permanent 
solutions to the severe overcrowding that plagues numerous Southeast and 
Mid-City schools. Last month, trustees approved expenditures of nearly $4 
million for a series of short-term actions -- mainly portable classrooms and 
busing of students to closed campuses -- to cope with overcrowding during the 
next couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals from schools Supt. Tom Payzant will be discussed by several 
advisory committees to the district, as well as by individual schools, during 
the next week and will be modified by trustees in subsequent meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees asked Payzant on Tuesday to rank the proposed construction in terms of 
importance, especially since studies of overcrowding in the Hoover and Mira 
Mesa areas are expected to recommend additional capital projects when they 
presented to the board in the spring.

Books from the publishing house of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich have been 
recommended as the major text for the new kindergarten-through-sixth-grade 
reading program to begin in July for more than 70,000 students in the San Diego 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagination: An Odyssey Through Language" would be used for most classes in 
basic education, second language and special education in the district. 
</P>
<P>
The Prentice Hall Literature Series from Prentice Hall publishers would be used 
in the seventh and eighth grades under the new program, which emphasizes the 
use of literature instead of controlled stories, along with merging reading, 
writing and discussion to teach grammar skills, rather than teaching skills 
separately. 
</P>
<P>
School board trustees are expected to approve the selections next week.

County Marshal Michael Sgobba) said Ricky Spells allegedly hit the bailiff with 
his fists in an inmate holding tank as Spells' handcuffs were being removed.

"It was an assault in the holding area. He was being returned from court. The 
deputy was unhandcuffing him at the time," Sgobba said.

Sgobba did not identify the injured deputy marshal, saying his wife had not yet

A paroled rapist pleaded innocent Tuesday to sexually assaulting two women in 
their 60s shortly after being released from state prison. 
</P>
<P>
Emmanuel Lucious, 29, is also charged with 11 other felonies, including 
robbery, burglary, assault with a deadly weapon and being a habitual offender. 
</P>
<P>
Lucious was convicted of raping an elementary school teacher and trying to rape 
another teacher in a highly publicized case in 1981. He was sentenced to 20 
years in prison, which was later reduced to 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
Lucious was released on parole last summer. Six weeks later, a 65-year-old 
woman was raped and another woman in her 60s was the victim of an attempted 
rape. Charges against Lucious were filed last month in connection with those 
attacks. Lucious has been held in County Jail since September. 
</P>
<P>
Bail was set at $500,000 by Municipal Judge William Woodward at the request of 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Bob Phillips, who described Lucious as "a danger to the 
community." A preliminary hearing was set for March 19. 
</P>
<P>
If Lucious is convicted of violating the habitual-offender statute alone, he 
could face a prison term of 20 years to life.

BUILDER ASKS COURT TO TELL HIDDEN HILLS TO ACCEPT SENIORS HOUSING PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A developer has asked a Los Angeles Superior Court judge to find the city of 
Hidden Hills in contempt of court and to order the approval of a lower-cost 
housing project in the wealthy town. 
</P>
<P>
Judge R. William Schoettler Jr. is scheduled to hold a hearing Thursday on 
Tarzana developer Danny Howard's request that the city be forced to approve his 
project, which includes 46 housing units for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Last year city officials disclosed the plan to build housing for seniors, to 
cost less than Hidden Hills' expensive houses, on part of 25 acres the gated 
city would annex from Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
A group of residents complained that the project would alter the single-family 
character of Hidden Hills, where large houses nestle among oaks. Three of the 
leading critics are running for the five-member City Council in April. 
</P>
<P>
The impending election is one reason that Howard is asking for the court order, 
said his attorney, Benjamin N. Reznik. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to lose the whole shebang here, the whole option we have on the 
property, and all the costs . . . if we don't get approved right away," Reznik 
said. "We're not going to stand idly by while certain interests or dissenters 
play politics with the court's order." 
</P>
<P>
The order was part of a settlement the city agreed to last year to settle a 
lawsuit over its formation of a redevelopment agency to finance a flood-control 
project. State law requires 20% of redevelopment funds to be spent on 
lower-cost housing. Under the settlement, the city agreed to include Howard's 
development project, with the senior citizen housing, in its redevelopment 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
Under Howard's plan, nine luxury homes would be built on 20 acres within the 
town's gates and on its network of private roads. The housing for seniors and a 
commercial building would be built on the 5 acres outside the gates. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council has generally supported the development proposal as a way to 
settle the lawsuit. But, amid continuing public pressure, the council last 
month began considering whether the legal requirement could be eliminated 
simply by disbanding the redevelopment agency. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Wayne K. Lemieux suggested that idea last month in a conference with 
Schoettler. According to Lemieux, Schoettler said he did not wish to see the 
opportunity for lower-cost housing slip away. 
</P>
<P>
In a response Tuesday the request for a contempt citation, City Atty. Wayne K. 
Lemieux said in court documents that the city is meeting the requirements of 
last year's settlement. The settlement contained no deadlines that the city has 
broken, he said. The city plans to begin Planning Commission consideration of 
the project next Wednesday, with City Council action possible by April 17, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The city is moving with reasonable dispatch," Lemieux said.

COUNTY BARS DEMOLITION AT HISTORIC SITE IN CALABASAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN O'SHAUGHNESSY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday voted to temporarily 
block demolition of a building in historic Old Town Calabasas that a developer 
wants to replace with a three-story office structure. 
</P>
<P>
Preservationists say they are worried that the builder's plans would damage the 
Old West flavor of the village, a former stagecoach stop, which straddles 
Calabasas Road. The last vestiges of the village are the 146-year-old Leonis 
Adobe and a handful of turn-of-the-century wooden buildings, including the one 
that was slated for demolition this week. 
</P>
<P>
The building was at one time an inn for hunters and for decades was a small 
grocery store. It was especially popular with children who stopped by on their 
horses for soda and candy. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the building at 23504 Calabasas Road has been used for many 
purposes, including, variously, a restaurant, yogurt shop and beauty salon, 
said Alice Stelle, president of the Calabasas Historical Society. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the developer's plans to demolish the structure to construct an 
office building, Supervisor Mike Antonovich said, "If allowed to take place, 
this action would spell the end of what is truly a special and unique area." 
</P>
<P>
The emergency ordinance, which was approved unanimously, revoked the demolition 
permit granted by the county to the developer, Tandam Builders Inc. of Santa 
Monica. The ordinance requires that the builder argue his case for a new permit 
before the county Regional Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
With its vote, the board also made it more difficult to destroy any buildings 
in the Old Town area in the future. Anyone with such plans will have to receive 
the approval of the planning commission. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time that preservationists have fought against a 
perceived encroachment on Old Town. Homeowner groups recently filed a lawsuit 
against Caltrans in an attempt to block a planned Ventura Freeway interchange 
that would force removal of many old trees and route more traffic through Old 
Town. Residents recently held an auction with some items donated by celebrities 
to raise money for the litigation. 
</P>
<P>
Preservationists hailed Tuesday's board action, which was prompted by a request 
from the Las Virgenes Homeowners Federation. 
</P>
<P>
Myra Turek, president of the Calabasas Park Homeowners Assn., who said she has 
seen plans for the office building, said the contemporary structure would be 
more appropriate on Wilshire Boulevard or Rodeo Drive. 
</P>
<P>
"I took one look, and I couldn't continue looking at it," Turek said. "It upset 
me so greatly that that would go into Old Town Calabasas." 
</P>

A spokesman for Tandam, which earlier promised homeowners that it would explore 
modifying the design so that the building would blend in better with its 
surroundings, said he was shocked by the vote. Joel Kirschenstein, a Westlake 
Village-based consultant for the builder, said Tuesday that he was prepared to 
testify against the revocation of the permit but was assured by Antonovich's 
office that the matter would not be on the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
He said if the county wants to save the building, it should buy it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a building that's old, obsolete, it's not in code, it's a firetrap, it's 
vacant," Kirschenstein said. "What are we going to do?" 
</P>
<P>
There is actually little left of the original building, Stelle said. Several 
years ago, it was torn down, although its facade was saved.

WHY RULE OUT A PLEA BARGAIN?; 
</P>
<P>
 BE SMART, NOT VINDICTIVE, WITH EXXON: FEDS COULD LOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just what will it take to compensate Alaska for all that crude oil that fouled 
the state's pristine shoreline last March? What punishment of Exxon is 
appropriate for the Exxon Valdez spill? And what, if anything, can repair the 
damage to the Alaskan psyche and the wrenching of Alaskan social cohesion? 
</P>
<P>
Some of these questions presumably will be answered in the trial of a 
five-count criminal indictment returned against Exxon after the U.S. Justice 
Department gave up attempts to negotiate an out-of-court settlement. There was 
considerable criticism of the Justice Department for seeming to rush to an 
agreement that was acceptable to Exxon but not to Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
A plea bargain should not be ruled out, though, just because the case has now 
moved into the courtroom. This will be a tough one for the government to win. 
Even if it prevails, there is no assurance that Exxon will be fined as much as 
the firm was willing to settle for without a trial. But if negotiations are 
reopened, the key element is to bring the state of Alaska to the table as a 
full partner. The crude oil may have spilled in federal waters, but the real 
damage was sustained by Alaskans and Alaskan natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
Not to be overlooked are the social and economic consequences of the spill. 
Much has been made of the estimated $2 billion Exxon spent with such elan on 
the cleanup. A boon to the economy, some said. But another view is that Exxon 
showered southern Alaska with money partly to offset the public- relations 
beating the firm was taking. And this windfall of currency -- workers bolted 
their $5-an-hour local jobs to get $16 from Exxon -- caused severe disruption 
of the economy and even the social fabric. Bitterness, reminiscent of the 
raucous pipeline-construction days in the 1970s, erupted between those who took 
Exxon money and those who refused; those who were, or became, "pro-oil" and 
those who were "anti-oil." 
</P>
<P>
Back in the '70s, Alaskans yielded to oil-industry soothings and their own 
greed in discounting the warnings of danger, Terry Carr, an Anchorage Daily 
News editorial writer, recalled recently in Newsweek. "Alaskans rationalized 
that we could have the best of both worlds: the incredible riches the oil 
wrought and the incredible beauty of the land," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The bubble burst and now the penalty must be exacted from Exxon. It should be 
fair, not vindictive. But it also must be done in such a way that Alaskans feel 
that they retain some control over their own destiny.

NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANYMORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Results are still dribbling in from the regional and local elections held 
across the Soviet Union's vast Slavic heartland last Sunday, but the returns so 
far can only cheer supporters of reform. 
</P>
<P>
Whether they ran as members of the Communist Party or outsiders, candidates in 
the Russian Federation, the Ukraine and Byelorussia who want to speed the pace 
of economic and political change fared well, particularly in big cities. 
Moreover, the elections provided further evidence of a decisive trend toward 
political pluralism and, perhaps soon, even a genuine multiparty system. Last 
month the Communist Party agreed to end its monopoly on political power. Free 
elections are now working to turn that pledge into a reality. 
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has reason to feel both vindicated and uplifted. 
Openly frustrated by Old Guard obstructionists within the party and government 
bureaucracy, he can now point to the poor showing of many apparatchiks as proof 
that he grasps the public's mood far better than do local party functionaries. 
If runoffs later this month lead to the ouster of still more party 
conservatives, as expected, Gorbachev's efforts to widen and hasten reform 
would be bolstered. 
</P>
<P>
A steadily worsening economy daily adds greater urgency to those efforts. 
Gorbachev's advisers aren't lacking in insights about what must be done to 
rescue the country from further stagnation and even -- the word is now openly 
spoken -- collapse. But clearing the arena of political deadwood won't by 
itself usher in an era of essential structural reforms. As Poland's 
forced-draft shift from a centralized to a market economy so vividly is 
showing, the process of change can exact a painful toll. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody, including the Kremlin, knows whether Soviet citizens are ready to 
tolerate that pain. At least, though, they are being consulted through the 
mechanism of elections. Those elections aren't yet wide-open. But they do offer 
Soviet citizens a free choice, something that few have ever known.

COMMUNISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Karl Marx were alive today to see the fall of "communism" in the Soviet 
Union and Eastern Europe he would be unable to understand why people associate 
totalitarian systems and closed economies as communist societies. 
</P>
<P>
For Marx a communist country is altruistic and he would be insulted that people 
equate the Soviet Union with his name. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Marx would predict the world is transforming from dictatorial systems 
that repress people as in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and South Africa, to 
democratic systems that provide greater freedoms. 
</P>
<P>
Once society no longer represses people, socialistic systems will develop, 
providing all people with the basic human needs for survival, and from 
socialism will come communism.

STATE EXECUTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a registered Democrat who is opposed to capital punishment, I am saddened 
and disappointed by the treatment of this issue by the three candidates for 
California governor. On one side is Democrat Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp, a 
self-proclaimed opponent to the death penalty who has allowed his political 
ambitions to turn him into a hypocrite calling for a renewal of executions in 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side are Democrat Dianne Feinstein and Republican Sen. Pete 
Wilson, both strong advocates of the death penalty on the grounds that it will 
make California safer from criminals. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, there is no evidence to support the idea that capital punishment 
is a deterrent, and in fact there is strong evidence to support the theory that 
it serves only to brutalize society and make us more tolerant of violence. I am 
sickened and appalled by cowardly or ignorant politicians who continue to take 
advantage of growing public frustration about crime to encourage 
state-sanctioned killing in order to obtain votes. Having to choose between 
three such candidates in the upcoming gubernatorial elections is truly 
disheartening.

EMOTIONS AND CO-DEPENDENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oh what a breath of fresh air! (Elfriede H. Kristwald "Now They Call It 
Co-Dependency," Op-Ed Page, Feb. 14.) Thank you! As a psychological therapist 
and as a woman I am nauseated with this Pablum-coated psychobabble continually 
churned out by the psychology profession eschewing love as "co-dependency." 
</P>
<P>
I certainly hope so! Love is our mightiest moment. In my view, we are supposed 
to be with, in, around and with those we love -- this is nature, not pathology. 
</P>
<P>
I have a lover who has never been involved in the psychology world in any way. 
He wants to be with me all the time. My goal is to make sure he never gets into 
a therapy group and learns to be ashamed of his love and passion for me! 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps we have another case of "Those who can, do, and, those who can't, 
teach." That is, those who cannot love and give themselves call others who can, 
pathological. I will add that loving another person to the point of your own 
destruction is pathological. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, this theory of co-dependency as pathology is absurd. Unfortunately, a lot 
of people have been taught to be ashamed of their loving capacity. This is, 
indeed, a loss to humanity. So shame on my profession for that!

I never expected to be in agreement with former Los Angeles Police Chief Davis 
about anything. But he is absolutely right. 
</P>
<P>
The child-rearing expert Selma Fraiberg, said: "Love-starved children are 
likely to become bondless, hollow men and women who contribute largely to the 
criminal population. Their non-attachment leaves a void in that area of 
personality where conscience can be. When there are no human attachments there 
can be no conscience. The potential for violence is far greater among these 
bondless men and women. We must look upon a baby deprived of human partners as 
a baby in deadly peril. This is a baby who is being robbed of his humanity." 
</P>

The best child-care agency cannot meet a child's need for one-on-one, 
constantly available parenting from either gender.

CRIME: DO WE REALLY WANT TO LOCK UP AND MAKE CRIMINALS OUT OF HUNDREDS OF 
THOUSANDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE THEIR DRUG OF CHOICE IS NOT OURS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE DOMANICK, Joe Domanick is a Los Angeles writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seated in the rear of a Superior Court room in downtown Los Angeles, Derrick 
Beckwith's mother eyes me suspiciously, another white man asking questions that 
can only bring more problems to a son already waist-deep into trouble with the 
law. But Derrick, 25, dark-skinned, Jheri-curled and modestly dressed for his 
court appearance, nervously agrees to talk with me anyway. 
</P>
<P>
In between whispered snatches of conversation, we watch the steady stream of 
mostly black young men being brought in for their three-to-five minutes of 
fast-food justice. Each wears a blue or orange L.A. County Jail jump suit, 
handcuffs and an expression of studied cool, the only vestige of dignity that 
can be mustered in a situation where one doesn't make the slightest move 
without the direction of a keeper. 
</P>
<P>
Derrick, however, isn't feeling cool, facing, as he is, five years for a parole 
violation. "They trying to say," he tells me, "that I was a witness to someone 
selling drugs. But I don't know nothing about it, but they're charging me with 
a violation 'cause I was around the guy." And what, I ask, was he on parole 
for? "Drugs, man. Possession and sale. That's all it's ever been. Period." 
That, of course, is his story. 
</P>
<P>
The cop's story is that Beckwith was a lookout on a $20 sale of a rock of 
cocaine to an undercover officer. The girl who led the officer to the dealer 
and the dealer also have been arrested. Three people are thus facing felony 
charges over the sale of one $20 rock. Later in the day Beckwith will cop a 
plea and be sentenced to three years in state prison. There he'll join about 
90,000 other inmates, up from the 25,000 incarcerated in California prisons in 
1980. About one-third of those are black males. 
</P>
<P>
I'd gone to court to try to understand those and several other startling 
statistics I'd read just days before: One in four black men in their 20s in the 
United States is currently either in prison, in jail, on probation or on 
parole. One in four. And that number, as Alvin Poussaint, the black Harvard 
psychologist had pointed out to me earlier, is even worse than it sounds. When 
you exclude the vast portion of the black middle class who are in college or 
the Army, says Poussaint, what you're really talking about is 50% of the young 
black male inner-city underclass. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those arrests, of course, were for serious crimes like murder, 
manslaughter, rape and assault. Some were for violence among youth such as 
gang-banging; others were for drunk driving, a crime now vigorously enforced, 
and some were for robbery and theft. (The latter are crimes that young black 
males, about 30% of whom come from families living below the poverty line and 
30% to 40% of whom are unemployed, commit in vastly disproportionate numbers. 
Blacks comprise about 12% of the population.) 
</P>
<P>
But it is small-time drug crimes like Beckwith's that are increasingly 
responsible for the huge numbers of young black men that are now overwhelming 
the criminal justice system in California and nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Out of 26 cases on Judge J.D. Smith's calendar on this day, for example, 19 are 
for what public defender Forrest Latiner calls "chicken drug cases" -- that is, 
the sale or possession of drugs, or the "testing dirty" for drugs once on 
probation or parole. "Our President," he tells me disgustedly, "would be very 
excited over these cases." Latiner puts the percentage of cases he defends in 
this category at between 50% and 70%. "It's frightening," says Judge Smith, a 
former LAPD motorcycle cop, "to think we're losing a whole generation. You 
don't even feel good when you sentence these guys." In 1983, according to 
Smith, the Central Division of L.A. Superior Court handled about 5,000 cases. 
In 1989 they processed about 17,000, an increase in large measure because of 
the get-tough priorities of our war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"We're on an incarceration binge," says Joan Petersilia, the director of the 
RAND Corp. criminal justice program. "We're putting more people in prison, but 
because of overcrowding, they're doing less time. That includes violent 
offenders too." And when they get out, she adds, they are ex-cons, with all the 
problems to themselves and society that that entails. "We're making this 
tremendous effort, but for what?" she asks. "Robbery, rape, aggravated assaults 
are all up and more dangerous in California, and we've tripled the prison 
population." 
</P>
<P>
There are, of course, no easy answers, but at the very least we should ask 
ourselves a few hard questions. Do we really want to continue to lock up and 
make criminals out of hundreds of thousands of young people because their drug 
of choice is not ours? When will we as a society stop thinking in the same way 
as Sal's bigoted son in "Do the Right Thing," who sees Eddie Murphy and Bill 
Cosby as heroes and the black underclass as subhumans? And lastly, how can we 
get George Bush to realize that coming to Los Angeles specifically to dedicate 
yet another new prison on the day before Derrick Beckwith is sentenced might 
not be the best way to symbolize a kinder, gentler America?

<TEXT>
<P>
The word crisis has become part of our political vocabulary. We knew that this 
was true as far as capitalism was concerned. Today we find ourselves 
experiencing the same ailment, which makes it possible to draw certain 
analogies. 
</P>
<P>
Capitalism was in a state of very grave crisis in the late 1920s and the early 
'30s. The attempts of some countries to extricate themselves from a capitalist 
system by resorting to totalitarian dictatorships, war and imperial chauvinism 
led to complete catastrophe for which, unfortunately, the rest of the world 
also had to pay a high price. 
</P>
<P>
A different approach prevailed in the United States. That country's leaders 
realized that they could get out of the crisis through radical reforms and 
democratization -- the same things we call perestroika nowadays. President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal also came up against numerous difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the New Deal triumphed and saved capitalism. But it was a capitalism 
different from that described by Marx and Engels in the 19th Century and by 
Lenin at the beginning of the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Today many Soviet economic executives and some of our scientists try to 
persuade us that in the course of economic reforms, our citizens will have to 
make more sacrifices and that the situation "will grow worse before it gets any 
better." I don't see how it can get much worse than now. It is illogical to 
contend that the efforts to restore elementary economic order in a generally 
rich country, which has all the necessary conditions for normal life but has 
been led to the brink by economic inefficiency, could lead to even further 
deterioration. 
</P>
<P>
We are told that this is inevitable because a radical economic reform will take 
a long time. This may be so, especially if we continue to put up with delays in 
carrying through the reform, deviations from its course and even sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
I can't accept any explanation other than complete loss of control over the 
economy and lack of personal responsibility for such failures. The same is true 
of the outrageous situation in distribution, in which a great many of our 
products disappear without a trace, like in the twilight zone. 
</P>
<P>
I think that we don't give enough importance to a condition that exists from 
top to bottom throughout the Soviet Union today -- the lack of efficiency, 
professionalism, elementary managerial skills and the ability to solve 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Some economic reform proposals call for shifting the burden of hardship onto 
the population, whose living conditions are already far from easy, by calling 
for money confiscation in one form or another. Does a state, in particular one 
with the ambition to become based on the rule of law, have any right at all to 
take away money belonging to its citizens? Such a measure should only be used 
in the event of war or revolution or other emergencies. It cannot be used to 
solve problems that are the result of mismanagement and the mistakes, 
ineptitude and inefficiency of economic leaders. 
</P>
<P>
More realistic and long-term measures have been suggested, including the 
reduction of state expenditures. The Soviet Union remains a rather extravagant 
spender, throwing away hundreds of billions of rubles on unnecessary capital 
construction, the production of unnecessary commodities, the military and the 
maintenance of a huge apparatus. It is bad when the finance ministry strives to 
make up for this bacchanalia of extravagance with excessive taxes and all sorts 
of extortions that may ruin the country. 
</P>
<P>
Comparing the experience of our countries might help those who cannot 
understand that many people in the United States and Western Europe regard the 
success of perestroika as being in their interests. During the Great 
Depression, was it in the interests of the Soviet Union for the United States 
to follow the same route of several European countries into fascism and 
militarism, or see the New Deal prevail, even though its aim was to save 
capitalism? World War II showed the benefit of the second alternative. And 
today, when many nuclear power stations are scattered across the globe and when 
huge arsenals of deadly weapons have been accumulated in the world, who stands 
to gain from outbreaks of uncontrollable violence and anarchy in any country? 
</P>
<P>
There are ways out of the present difficulties. Let us not frighten either 
ourselves or others, for this could only demoralize the people and destabilize 
the situation. Besides, the inflation of pessimism and the exaggeration of 
difficulties are just a suitable and handy way to cover up the tracks of bad 
economic leaders and inefficient workers and justify the slow pace of reforms 
designed to change the economy and the style and methods of economic 
management.

The nature of German society has been a key to European security for three 
centuries. Yet as East Germany collapses into the lap of West Germany, most 
observers seem to have equated unification with an extension of West German 
society to the East. Little attention has been paid to the ways in which the 
East Germans will change the West German society to which others in the West 
have grown accustomed. 
</P>
<P>
A unified Republic of Germany will not only have a different name than the 
current Federal Republic; it will be a very different society. As the two 
German states grow together again, the East Germans will have considerable 
impact on their Western relatives. 
</P>
<P>
This has already been evident. The clear call for German unification by the new 
East German Social Democratic Party, or SPD, shocked many in the West German 
SPD, who for years had toyed with the idea of recognizing East Germany as a 
separate, sovereign country. The conservative alliance in East Germany, to take 
another example, is clear in its defense of the Oder-Neisse line as the 
German-Polish border, in contrast to its Western partners, the Christian 
Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union and in particular Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl. Until Tuesday, his vague utterances only heightened fears in 
Poland and elsewhere of the potential revisionist aims of a unified Germany. 
</P>
<P>
There are other examples. Given their communist heritage, the East Germans are 
sure to press their West German partners to prohibit any neo-fascist or extreme 
right-wing political activity in any part of Germany. Although it is doubtful 
that they could muster the strength to pass a constitutional ban on such 
activities, they will force an important debate in German society on 
neo-fascist activities. 
</P>
<P>
East Germans, who have grown up with an extensive social-welfare system, will 
also exert strong pressure in the new Germany to deepen and widen the already 
substantial social underpinnings of the strong West German economy. Unification 
could mean a striking move by the new Republic of Germany toward an economy 
that would combine robust capitalism with one of the world's most generous and 
extensive networks of social benefits, services and payments. The new Germany, 
in fact, could soon become the proponent and model of a successful third way 
between unfettered capitalism and the shackles of Stalinist socialism. 
</P>
<P>
In East Germany, neutrality has always beckoned as an expression of 
emancipation from the Soviet Union and the division of Germany. Now that both 
are happening, the image of neutrality shimmers invitingly. West Germans, bound 
to the West, are likely to prevail, but there will be a heated debate on 
Germany's role in the heart of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Believe it or not, East Germans are also likely to spark a more 
individualistic, grass-roots style of democracy than has existed in West German 
society. In West Germany, the rise of citizens' initiatives since the 1970s has 
been tightly linked to the emergence of the environmentally oriented Greens. In 
East Germany, the opposition groups that blossomed last fall have been distinct 
from the East German Greens. The East German citizens' movements have been 
strident supporters of local democracy and popular initiatives and referendums. 
They are quite skeptical of West Germany's political machine, which is 
dominated by the major parties and oiled by mutual favor, loyalty and tight 
discipline. East Germany's embryonic brand of participatory democracy could 
spread westward. 
</P>
<P>
Some negatives will also influence the scene. Even though ousted Communist 
leader Erich Honecker had always called East Germany the "anti-fascist state," 
the regime considered as taboo the growing signs of a marginal, indigenous 
neo-fascist movement. As a result, the Communist government never allowed the 
East German people themselves to go through the difficult process of digesting 
the Nazi past. Second, traditional German-Slavic enmity permeates East German 
culture. Relations between ordinary Poles and West Germans have been far better 
for many years than between Poles and their East German "allies." 
</P>
<P>
German emotions and energies will be absorbed by these and other issues. One 
thing is certain, though. Germany -- and Europe -- won't ever be the same 
again.

<P>
STANFORD WIDENS ITS MARGIN BY WINNING FIVE OF SEVEN EVENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Stanford won five of seven events Tuesday to increase its lead at the Pacific 
10 Conference men's swim championships at Belmont Plaza in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinal has 626 points, well ahead of second-place UCLA, which has 440. 
</P>
<P>
USC is third with 405 points. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford opened the session by winning the 200-yard medley relay with a 
conference record time of 1:28.54. Arizona was second. 
</P>
<P>
In the next event, Dave Wharton of USC waited until the last 25 yards to pull 
away from the field in the 400-yard individual medley. Wharton's time of 
3:51.10 was under the NCAA qualifying standard, but not as fast as Wharton 
wanted to go. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd hoped to be under 3:50, but my backstroke and breaststroke need a little 
work," said Wharton, the NCAA champion in the 200- and 400-yard individual 
medley events the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford won the next two events when seniors Doug Lillydahl and John Witchel 
won the 100-yard butterfly and the 200-yard freestyle, respectively. Lillydahl 
pulled away from the pack with 25 yards remaining, winning in a lifetime best 
of 47.63. Keith Dennison of Arizona State was second. 
</P>
<P>
"This time rearranges my goals," said Lillydahl. "I hoped to break 48. This was 
my best time by nearly a second." 
</P>
<P>
Witchel out-touched UCLA sophomore Brian Kurza at the finish, with a time of 
1:36.61. 
</P>
<P>
In the 100-yard breaststroke, UCLA sophomore Andrea Cecchi held off Stanford's 
Sam Schwartz and Matt Rodgers to win in an NCAA qualifying time of 54.32. 
</P>
<P>
The last individual event of the night, the 100-yard backstroke, pitted three 
UCLA swimmers against three Stanford swimmers. Cardinal swimmers went 1-3-5, 
led by sophomore Jeff Rouse, who out-touched Bruin Mark Thompson, 48.89-48.97. 
</P>
<P>
The meet concludes tonight, with finals starting at 6 p.m.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The NBA's director of scouting, Marty Blake, says Hank Gathers would have been 
a first-round selection in the draft. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Exactly how high he would have gone, I don't know," Blake says. "This is a 
year when you can't even pick a player of the year in college basketball. There 
are no Ewings, Robinsons, Mannings or Ferrys. The NCAA tournament and the 
postseason all-star games are going to decide a lot. But several teams that 
figure to pick in the 16th to 27th slots were interested in Hank." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Blake disagrees with the notion that his "tweener" height of 6 feet 7 would 
have worked against Gathers, the Loyola Marymount center who died Sunday after 
collapsing during a West Coast Conference tournament game against Portland. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
"He would have been a good NBA player because of his great desire and 
intensity," Blake said. "He was a 6-7 guy who played like he was 6-9 or 6-10. 
How big was Wes Unseld? Six-seven. Give me a player, not a size or a position." 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Gathers, a prolific rebounder blessed with great hands, most likely would have 
played small forward in the pros. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Blake also forecasts Bo Kimble, the Loyola Marymount guard, as a first-round 
selection. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Long ago, I circled March 7 on my calendar: The Kings vs. the Canadiens. Little 
did I suspect that the Kings would be in fourth place in their division, 
Montreal in third place in its, and both possessors of three-game losing 
streaks. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Remember the Flying Frenchmen? Montreal has the worst power-play percentage in 
the NHL, a feeble 13.8%. . . . 
</P>
<P>
And how about a team motored by Wayne Gretzky allowing as many goals -- 282 -- 
as it has scored?. . . . 
</P>
<P>
George Allen underwent surgery for a hernia nine days ago but was back on the 
job at Cal State Long Beach the next day. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Allen on his first recruiting class: "I thought we had a pretty good draft." . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Allen on spring practice, which begins April 16: "We'll do a lot of evaluating 
and concentrate on basic fundamentals and conditioning. I have to get to know 
my players because we don't have any preseason games before we play at Clemson 
in September." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Park expects Sunday Silence to run in the Californian on June 3 and 
the Gold Cup on June 24, before the $1-million invitational race against a 
field including Easy Goer on Aug. 4 at Arlington International. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Eagle Rock High is sponsoring the third annual Eagle Rock Relays from 10 a.m. 
to 6 p.m. Saturday at Occidental College, long one of the finest track and 
field facilities in Southern California. . . . 
</P>
<P>
All conference basketball tournaments should be eliminated, and the NCAA 
tournament thrown open to every Division I school. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It's foolish even to try picking a Final Four. But it was last year, too. None 
of the four -- Michigan, Seton Hall, Illinois or Duke -- won its conference 
race. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Top-ranked Oklahoma doesn't have a player on the All-Big Eight first team 
selected by Associated Press and only one, Skeeter Henry, on the second team. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Ron Harper still leads the Clippers in three-point field goals with 13. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers had two of the best three-point shooters in the league in Craig 
Hodges and Ricky Pierce but sent them and Terry Cummings to the Milwaukee Bucks 
for Marques Johnson, Junior Bridgeman, Harvey Catchings and cash on Sept. 29, 
1984. . . . 
</P>
<P>
One of the nicest comeback stories in the NBA is New Jersey Net center Sam 
Bowie, who ranks ninth in the league in rebounding. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordan is attempting more field goals than last season despite the 
Chicago Bulls' desire for more balanced shot distribution. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Chip Engelland, formerly of Palisades High and Duke, led the World Basketball 
League (6 feet 5 and under) All-Stars in scoring during a recent tour of Italy 
against rivals of all shapes and sizes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Under NCAA rules, a recruit can be given one souvenir program at a game he is 
attending, but not two. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Now that Mario Lemieux is out of the lineup, I'm no longer studying the 
Pittsburgh Penguins' scoring summaries. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Most underrated boxing movie of all-time is John Huston's "Fat City." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Not even counting his $10-million bonus, NBA Commissioner David Stern's annual 
salary of $3.5 million is nearly double those of baseball Commissioner Fay 
Vincent, NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue and NHL President John Ziegler 
combined. . . . 
</P>
<P>
This year, March Madness is that being dispensed by the baseball owners and 
players.

THE NHL; 
</P>
<P>
LEAGUE HASN'T PUT UP MUCH OF A FIGHT TO STOP BRAWLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Larry Goossen, one of the operators of the Ten Goose Boxing Club of North 
Hollywood, called last week and asked a reporter: "Hey, why do you keep writing 
all that negative stuff about the fighting in the Kings-Oilers game? That's a 
part of hockey, always has been. 
</P>
<P>
"That game got me interested in the Kings again. Maybe they'll be tough enough 
to go somewhere this year." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, it seemed easy to discount Goossen's opinion, chalking it up as 
natural for someone who makes his living in a violent world, but hardly 
representative of the typical hockey fan. 
</P>
<P>
Not necessarily. 
</P>
<P>
There are a lot of Larry Goossens out there, fans who revel in the gore. They 
are not only numerous, but vocal. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the fans were exhorting their heroes to fight during the Forum slugfest 
between the Kings and Edmonton, which contributed to an NHL-record 86 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
The players just shrugged Wednesday off as one of those nights. King owner 
Bruce McNall took satisfaction from the thought that his team was finally 
showing some toughness. And General Manager Rogie Vachon insisted that such 
incidents can't always be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
How can they be in a league where one of the biggest brawls in its bloody 
history is met by silence from the NHL's president? When a reporter called John 
Ziegler, hoping for a comment on the King-Oiler fiasco, he was told there would 
be no response. 
</P>
<P>
It was left to Brian O'Neill, a league vice president, to respond. "What could 
(Ziegler) say?" a league spokesman asked the reporter. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, maybe: "This disgrace will never happen again." 
</P>
<P>
No wonder Goossen and a lot of other people feel the way they do. They have 
friends in high places. 
</P>
<P>
From the president down, the prevailing opinion seems to be, this is hockey. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Where is it written that there is a natural relationship between hockey 
and fighting? 
</P>
<P>
The potential for violence is, perhaps, even greater in basketball, where 
giants constantly collide in the small space under the basket. 
</P>
<P>
In baseball, an object flying at batters at speeds close to 100 m.p.h. creates 
a constant atmosphere of tension. 
</P>
<P>
Football, the most violent game of all, could easily turn into a weekly fight 
card. 
</P>
<P>
But it doesn't happen. Not in any of these sports. And the reason is, those at 
the top hold a tight rein. Pitchers are quickly ejected for throwing at 
hitters. Players are removed, suspended and/or heavily fined in all other 
sports before they can wreak havoc. 
</P>
<P>
When the Lakers' Magic Johnson and the Phoenix Suns' Kevin Johnson engaged in a 
shoving match early in a game this season, both were immediately kicked out, 
although they are marquee players that fans had come to see. The NBA made it 
plain that the prevention of violence is a high priority -- and no punches were 
ever thrown. 
</P>
<P>
If that had happened in the NHL, they wouldn't have stopped play. 
</P>
<P>
After all, in a game that resulted in 86 penalties, seven ejections, numerous 
fights and a facial fracture and scratched cornea sustained by King right wing 
Tomas Sandstrom, the total punishment to date has been one $500 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Give us a break. 
</P>
<P>
How do you stop it? 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's game between the Kings and the Winnipeg Jets is a good example. There 
were five ejections, although not a punch was thrown. Several of the ejections 
were automatic, but referee Rob Shick was still criticized by players and 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
And the headline in the Winnipeg Free Press read: "Zebra Steals the Show." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it should have read: "Zebra Saves the Show." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe if more officials blew the whistle on the goons in the NHL, scenes such 
as last Wednesday night's wouldn't occur. 
</P>
<P>
If the ejections had started early in the first period, the King-Oiler game 
might not have degenerated as much as it did. The message would get through 
quickly. Either the league's bullies start playing hockey, or take their 
talents where they would be better appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
Like the boxing ring. 
</P>
<P>
Or Wrestlemania. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's violence didn't even reach that level of respectability. It looked 
more like the gang wars in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Even in boxing, the mayhem is controlled. Nobody is allowed to go after an 
opponent with a stick. 
</P>
<P>
As for the fans who say the violence is one reason they come, hockey will 
survive without them. 
</P>
<P>
It's a sport with a lot to offer -- basketball on ice, soccer on skates. And in 
some ways, it's even better. 
</P>
<P>
Hockey has the constant action that basketball lacks because of those endless 
trips to the free-throw line. And hockey has the potential for high scoring 
that soccer lacks. 
</P>
<P>
Watching Wayne Gretzky perform his magic on the ice can be every bit as 
aesthetically pleasing as watching the magic of his fellow Forum superstar. 
</P>
<P>
So why has hockey gone a decade without a regular presence on network 
television? 
</P>
<P>
Because to enter the mainstream of team sports and reach a wide audience, it 
has to shed its bad-boy image. The blood turns off too many people. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, fighting has a place in sports. 
</P>
<P>
But only in the ring, not on the rink.

Bill Foster had an empty feeling after his final game as coach at the 
University of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Only 2,397 fans showed up at 15,000-seat Miami Arena Tuesday night to see the 
Hurricanes defeat Florida International, 83-55. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave the the Hurricanes a 13-15 record and ended their worst season 
since Foster resurrected the program in 1985 after a 15-year hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some things we didn't get done that I'd have liked to get done, and 
that bothers me," Foster said. "It's a little bittersweet." 
</P>
<P>
Foster, who announced last fall that this season would be his last with the 
Hurricanes, had a 78-71 record at Miami. His teams failed to earn a postseason 
bid and attendance was rarely more than 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Jerome Scott scored a career-high 22 points for the Hurricanes.

FISHING REPORT: OUTDOORS; 
</P>
<P>
LAKE CASTAIC IS THE PLACE FOR THE BEST LARGEMOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To say largemouth bass have been active at Lake Castaic would be an 
understatement. So many sizable fish have been caught this past week at the Los 
Angeles County reservoir that a spokeswoman called the week "one of the best 
ever." 
</P>
<P>
Ed Puente of Saugus, fishing with a crawfish on the upper lake, caught a 17 
1/4-pound bass. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Nagel of Sepulveda used a plastic worm on the lower lake to land a 
16-pound 15-ounce largemouth. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE MEAD -- Lower Basin producing some stripers between two and four pounds at 
45-60 feet. Anchovies best bet. 
</P>
<P>
BULLHEAD CITY -- Trout fair on river. Berkley Power Bait best bet. Crappie most 
active at Topock Marsh, biting on minnows. Striped bass in lake scattered and 
deep. Anchovies best bet. 
</P>
<P>
SALTON SEA -- Orangemouth corvina becoming increasingly active as water warms, 
biting on artificials and live shad. North Shore jetty, Niland and Red Hill 
most productive areas. Croaker bite fair from Salt Creek to Bombay Beach. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE CACHUMA -- Two recent plants of trout. Food chain rich, trout full and 
reluctant to bite. Largemouth bass fair, mainly in deep-water areas along rocky 
shorelines. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE CASITAS -- Largemouth bass picking up, biting at about 10 feet. Arrow 
Island and front side of main island producing most fish. Crawfish and 
nightcrawlers good for bigger fish; brown and green plastic worms producing 
more but smaller fish. Mike Frankland, Blossom Valley, 14 3/4-pound bass. Don 
Dusing, Canyon Country, 12 1/4-pound bass. Trout active at northeast side. 
Trollers doing best, using three-four colors and needlefish lure. 
</P>
<P>
PYRAMID LAKE -- Catfish providing most action, biting mainly at dam and 
channel. Sydney and Parchelle Moragne, Skokie, Ill., 10 1/2- and 3 1/2-pound 
catfish, caught at dam. Robert Barton, Arcata, 10- and 9 1/2-pound catfish, 
caught on anchovies in channel. Striped bass slow. Largemouth bass most active 
at Brazo's Cove and island. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE PIRU -- Trout planted recently, biting. Trollers using five-eight colors 
and bikini needlefish. Power Bait and Velveeta cheese working in Felicia Cove. 
Largemouth bass moving into shallow water to spawn. Rocky ledges and points of 
coves best bet. Catfish fair in deep water at dam. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE CASTAIC -- Largemouth bass active in both lakes. Ed Puente, Saugus, 17 
1/4-pound bass, caught in upper lake on crawfish. Peter Vincioni, Moorpark, 11 
1/4-pound bass. Phillip Catalano, Santa Monica, 10 1/4-pound bass. Douglas Del 
Gado, Van Nuys, 10 3/4-pound bass, caught in lower lake. Scott Scotton, 
Manhattan Beach, three bass, largest nine pounds. Doug Eklund, Burbank, 
eight-pound bass, caught in upper lake. Trout fair in upper lake. Rod Stauta, 
Sepulveda, 3 1/4-pound trout, caught in upper lake. John Phur, 2 3/4-pound 
trout, caught in upper lake. 
</P>
<P>
IRVINE LAKE -- Trout most active at West Shore, Sierra Cove and to the right of 
boat docks. 
</P>
<P>
PUDDINGSTONE RESERVOIR -- Trout planted recently by Department of Fish and Game 
and private hatchery -- some to six pounds. Yellow Power Bait and inflated 
nightcrawlers at swim beach and east shore producing most fish. 
</P>
<P>
PERRIS LAKE -- Spotted bass most active at lots 11 &amp; 12. Dave Neal, 
Riverside, six-pound spotted bass. Trout stocked Monday, fish biting at lots 11 
&amp; 12 and launch ramp. Other species slow. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE SILVERWOOD -- Largemouth and striped bass getting most of the attention, 
biting at various locations on various baits and lures.

<P>
ALFA STAR HAS UNIQUE RACING OUTFIT

<P>
Alfa Star, one of the most easily recognizable standardbreds at Los Alamitos, 
looks like a cross between a hockey goalie and Bugs Bunny. 
</P>
<P>
A white hood covers his head and ears, which are stuffed with nylon cones to 
muffle the crowd noise. He also wears a yellow shadow roll and cheek pieces to 
keep his mind off possible distractions below and behind him. 
</P>
<P>
"He tries too hard," said owner Gary Budahn, a track veterinarian who assists 
trainer Mark Anderson with the horse. "He doesn't trust the driver. He tries to 
race his own way. He's had tremendous speed but is hard to handle." 
</P>
<P>
A leading threat in the invitational trot each Saturday, Alfa Star has broken 
stride in three of eight starts this year, but won three other times when he 
stayed on gait. The 5-year-old has earned more than $130,000 during his career 
with a best time of 1:57 2/5. 
</P>
<P>
"I was schooling him as a 2-year-old, and he took off on a flat run," recalled 
Budahn. "My arms were noodles. He's like a wiry football player. He's not that 
muscular but he's really strong." 
</P>
<P>
His outfit rivals a Florence Griffith Joyner original. Besides the distinctive 
headgear, Alfa Star wears enough equipment to fill a stall. Groom Jesse Rios 
begins laying out the equipment at 5:30 p.m. on a racing night. 
</P>
<P>
The high-strung trotter requires three different bits, one for jogging, one for 
warm-ups on race night, and one for the race. The Simpson bit is a chain-link 
model that goes into his mouth during the race. In addition, he wears an O'Mara 
overcheck bit that serves as a chin-chain to keep his head up. 
</P>
<P>
He also wears a fiberglass head pole to keep his head to the left, Italian 
leather trotting boots on his hind legs and elbow boots on his front legs, 
four-ounce brass toe weights and flattened shoes to compensate for his high 
stride. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a regular puzzle," said Budahn. 
</P>
<P>
Budahn and his wife, Debbie, live in Rolling Hills Estates with their three 
children. They race under the name Gusty Stable. Both are natives of Minnesota 
and were undergraduates at Gustavus Adolphus, abbreviated to Gusty by anybody 
pressed for the time to go six syllables or shaky in spelling. Gary's father 
manages the largest creamery in the world in Borgards, Minn., only 15 minutes 
from Savage, the home of legendary pacer Dan Patch at the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Gusty has enjoyed more than its share of luck with 5-year-olds Alfa Star and 
Doodlin. Doodlin, a pacing mare, won the $10,000 invitational Friday in 1:57, 
raising her career earnings near the $330,000 mark. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife was home doodling on the phone that day," said Budahn of the naming. 
"I have no imagination when it comes to names -- only veto power." 
</P>
<P>
A Viking fan, Budahn did contribute the names Purple Reign and Purple People 
Eater to the stable. 
</P>
<P>
Both 5-year-old stars are homebreds with Hunter's Star blood. Alfa Star is by 
Hunter's Star-Alfa's Winner; Doodlin by Rowdy Yankee out of the Hunter's Star 
mare Latin Star. 
</P>
<P>
Doodlin was honored as Western Standardbred Assn. horse of the year in 1988. 
Coincidentally, Budahn -- who also is president of the association -- presented 
the 1989 award in the Los Alamitos winner's circle Saturday night to Rick and 
Maryann Plano for pacer Winning Night after having accepted the award for 
Doodlin a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't get Alfa's Winner in foal the first year and were preparing to 
give her away the second year when she took," said Budahn. "We tried to sell 
both Alfa Star and Doodlin as yearlings but business was so bad in California 
then we couldn't give them away. 
</P>
<P>
"Alfa Star was always a good-looking horse but Doodlin was awful-looking as a 
yearling. She was ill-proportioned and her muscles were not defined. It took 
until May or June of her 2-year-old year to grow into herself and look like a 
horse." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Crowe, trainer-driver of Cam Fella, 1982 and '83 harness horse of the year, 
was at Los Alamitos over the weekend. He brought in nine horses from Toronto to 
be sold. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to sell them at an auction in Toronto April 21 but I talked to 
Lloyd Arnold (Los Alamitos president and general manager), and he said they 
needed horses out here and would have no trouble selling," said Crowe. 
</P>
<P>
Interest in ownership has risen so sharply that 60 horses have been claimed 
since the meet opened in November, more than in the previous 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
"I brought five colts and four fillies," said Crowe. "Two of the 3-year-olds 
are by Cam Fella; a colt, Cam Hill, and a filly, Armbro Inga. I also brought a 
4-year-old named On the Beach, who took a mark of 1:58 2/5 last year and is a 
full brother to Beach Towel, one of the top 2-year-olds in the nation last 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Crowe, 52, still enjoys reminiscing about Cam Fella, who won 61 of 80 starts, 
earned more than $2 million and concluded his career with a 28-race winning 
streak against top competition. Cam Fella stands at stud in New Jersey and has 
sired champions Camtastic and Goalie Jeff. 
</P>
<P>
Crowe still blames himself for Cam Fella's defeat in the 1982 Shelly Goudreau 
Pace at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
"He should have won that too," Crowe said. "It was my fault. I drove him bad. I 
was locked in at the rail in fifth or sixth and the horse in front of me made a 
break at the three-quarter pole, scattering the field. 
</P>
<P>
"The race I most remember was when he beat Its Fritz at the Meadowlands. Its 
Fritz had won six or seven in a row. He went by us at the head of the stretch 
and opened up three lengths, and I thought we were beat. But Cam came back and 
beat him by a length and a half at the wire. He just had so much desire. He was 
a winner. To win 28 in a row is unheard of. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to bring him to California in the fall of '83, when he had won 
something like 25 in a row. I had just won in British Columbia and was looking 
for a race. They put up $75,000 in Toronto and $50,000 in Florida for races for 
him. I called Hollywood Park and asked if there would be a race for him. I 
talked to Larry Marsh (general manager) and he said, 'Nope.' " 
</P>
<P>
Continental Racing Assn., a Chicago-based group, has sent a written proposal to 
Fairplex Park in Pomona for harness dates from November to January after the 
summer-fall Los Alamitos meet closes. Patrick Flavin is president of the 
association that operates harness meets at Maywood Park in Chicago. 
</P>

Harness Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Clockers Corner returns Saturday at 10 a.m. for each Saturday of the meet 
through April 14. The festivities, free to the public, include workouts, 
handicapping information and guest speakers. Trainer-driver Jim Butler and 
handicapper-simulcast host Joel Lesser will be the guests this week in the 
clubhouse near the winner's circle. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer-driver Jack Olsen got the "O for Olsen" tag off when he guided 
Empennage to victory last week. He had been zero for 71 for the meet. . . . 
Jerry Silverman, leading trainer from the East, made a rare appearance during 
the weekend. He looked at a horse in Abe Stoltzfus' stable. 
</P>
<P>
Power and Glory and Magic Moose used powerful stretch kicks in winning the 
featured invitational pace and trot, respectively, last Saturday. Power and 
Glory, handled by Jim Todd, won the pace in 1:53 4/5, rallying in a :27 3/5 
final quarter to nip Dare You To at the wire. Magic Moose came from behind with 
Pete Foley in the sulky and caught Thadrow in the final strides in 1:57 3/5.

SETTLING AN ACCIDENT 'ON THE SPOT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON G. CAMPBELL, Campbell is a syndicated columnist and former Times staff 
writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Something interesting has happened to me, and I am wondering if it 
indicates a new trend in the automobile insurance field. A few days ago, I was 
driving my brand-new, 2-month-old Toyota Celica when a woman driving a van 
broadsided me at an intersection. I had the right of way. 
</P>
<P>
After making sure I wasn't hurt, the woman readily admitted she had stopped for 
the "Stop" sign but had then pulled out and hit me. She was most insistent that 
both of us avoid our insurance companies and said she would write me a check 
with no questions asked as soon as I had an appraisal made. 
</P>
<P>
What really surprised me, though, was that when I checked with my insurance 
company, they seemed to think it was a perfectly logical way to settle the 
matter. When the lady and I talked later, she told me she had checked with her 
insurance carrier and that they, too, approved of the arrangement. The lady 
obviously wants to keep the accident off her record and keep her premiums down. 
In a subsequent phone conversation with her (before I had gotten my estimate), 
she said that when I was satisfied with the estimate, she would meet me at her 
bank, write me a check -- which I could deposit to my own account immediately 
-- and she would have a notarized form releasing her of liability for me to 
sign. The advantage to me, of course, would be that I would get my car repaired 
without paying the deductible. 
</P>
<P>
It all seems perfectly legal, and I have gotten the impression that "let's 
settle this matter privately" is a new trend. Is it? And as the injured party, 
are there any dangers in it for me? -- D.C. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: According to Mary Crystal, director of communications for the Insurance 
Information Institute at Preston, Calif., and Bob Christensen, a longtime State 
Farm Insurance agent in Glendale, this is a long way from being a "new trend." 
It's been going on for many years, and at one time or another, virtually all of 
us have participated in it. (You backed out of a parking space and nicked the 
car pulling in behind you. It was your fault, but it was also a $50 repair job, 
far under the deductible for both of you. So your "victim" had the nick taken 
care of and sent you the bill. End of story.) 
</P>
<P>
"It's always depended on circumstances," Crystal said. "How much money is 
involved, whether one or the other of you is at fault, that sort of thing. 
People today are just more sensitive about premiums and what can affect them, 
and so the dollar figures have gone up." 
</P>
<P>
State Farm's Christensen concurred. "The key to the whole thing," he adds, "is 
injury. If there is no injury, then it's simply a matter of money and the two 
parties can work out an agreeable deal between them. But both of them have to 
be careful when they do this. It sounds to me like the lady who hit this person 
may have a driving problem that could seriously impact her premiums if it 
became a matter of record, since she was clearly at fault. The comment about 
having a (liability release) for him to sign would also seem to suggest that 
she's had a little experience in this sort of thing. State Farm, however, 
wouldn't raise the premium of the driver who wasn't at fault, but simply not 
having to pay the deductible would make a deal like this worthwhile for him." 
</P>
<P>
But, as Christensen points out, both parties to a private settlement such as 
this have to watch out for some potential pitfalls. The victim has to make sure 
there are no physical injuries that might flare up later; that the estimate 
from the body shop is a firm one and that additional repairs won't surface 
after he's accepted her check (because, Christensen said, "once he's accepted 
and banked her check he's got no recourse"), and that the check he receives is 
"good." Also, if the victim's car is going to be out of action for several 
days, the other party should pay for the rental. "The victim shouldn't be out 
of pocket for anything," Christensen added. 
</P>
<P>
For the guilty party (in this case the woman who broadsided the other car), 
"her insistence that he sign a release of liability when payment is made is 
perfectly good business," Christensen stated. "She doesn't want him coming back 
in six months with a mysterious whiplash injury."

GILLETTE'S CARTRIDGE SHAVING SYSTEM GETS UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SIMROSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gillette has hit the market with Sensor, a high-tech razor the company calls 
"the world's first and only personalized shaving system." 
</P>
<P>
Its cartridge has two platinum-hardened, chromium blades mounted on tiny 
springs so the razor automatically adjusts to individual faces. It also has a 
newly designed, flow-through cartridge that permits easy rinsing and cleaning. 
</P>
<P>
Gillette, which invented the first safety razor in 1895, has spent 10 years and 
$200 million on the new shaver, introduced nationwide in January. The company 
plans to market Sensor in 19 countries. 
</P>
<P>
At a suggested retail price of $3.75 for Sensor and three cartridges, the new 
razor costs more than cheap disposable models. But Gillette is betting 
consumers will want to trade up from those, simply for a better shave. 
</P>
<P>
Sensor razors are available nationwide in drug and grocery stores and mass 
merchandise outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Imported Light Bulbs Shine Like the Sun 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles company is importing a new light bulb from Finland -- Chromalux, 
which produces a pure white light that duplicates sunlight. The bulbs, 
developed at the request of the Finnish government, come in various shapes and 
sizes, frosted or clear, from 25 to 150 watts. 
</P>
<P>
Chromalux spotlights and flood reflectors also are available, as are tubes for 
fluorescent fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
"They offer a variety of both health and aesthetic benefits," says Sherry Kahn 
of Westgate Enterprises, who is importing the bulbs with her partner, Christina 
Brady-Wokuluk. "A regular incandescent (bulb) has a lot of yellow in the 
light," Kahn explained, "while Chromalux is pure white and reveals the total 
color spectrum. With a 99.6% rating, it has the highest color rendition index 
in the world (for a bulb). Sunlight is 100%." 
</P>
<P>
Because the bulb increases black and white contrast, Kahn said, "readability is 
improved." The Chromalux is also said to be glare-free. 
</P>
<P>
The bulbs fit standard lamps and, Kahn said, are designed for extended use of 
3,000 hours, about one year of daily use. Chromalux bulbs are available from 
Westgate Enterprises, 11988 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 104, Los Angeles, Calif. 
90025; phone (213) 477-7260 or (213) 478-1954. Regular household Chromalux 
bulbs sell for $7.95; spotlights and flood reflectors, $16.95; 18-inch tubes, 
$19.95; eight-foot tubes, $29.95. Add $2.75 for shipping and handling. 
</P>
<P>
Moths Turn Up Noses to Herbal Scent 
</P>
<P>
Can't stand the smell of mothballs? Consider Moth-Away, a new moth-repellent 
made of natural herbs, not chemicals. It comes in a sachet. 
</P>
<P>
Moth-Away has a fresh herbal scent, so when you take your clothes out of 
storage, you don't have to air them out for days or dry clean them to get rid 
of the mothball odor. 
</P>
<P>
It is the first herbal moth repellent registered by the Environmental 
Protection Agency, said Robert Freelander, president of Richards Homewares, the 
product's manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
One box -- which contains 24 packets -- will protect clothing in three 
standard-size garment bags for up to a year. 
</P>
<P>
Moth-Away will be available nationwide late next month in drug and grocery 
chains, home centers and mass merchandisers. Or you can order it now from 
Richards Homewares Inc., P.O. Box 92019, Long Beach, Calif. 90809; phone, (213) 
424-8671. A box of 24 packets costs $4.95, plus $2.95 for postage and handling 
(up to six boxes).

<P>
THE SHOW: "House of Style," MTV'S quick read on fashion, airing quarterly. 
</P>
<P>
THE SETUP: Super-model Cindy Crawford hosts this jaunt through France, Milan, 
London and the United States in search of what's hot on and off the runways. 
</P>
<P>
THE LOOK: Crawford wears a red, body-hugging, off-the-shoulder Giorgio di 
Sant'Angelo top with jeans. As for the rest, hundreds of quick takes convey the 
message: "We're hip, we're happening and we're outta here." The swimwear 
segment is memorable, with a politically correct "keep our waters clean" 
maillot by Robin Piccone for Body Glove. The London streets segment promises 
some of the wildest clothes in the world, but comes up looking old hat, with 
skull-print casual clothes as well as bell-bottom hippie looks. 
</P>
<P>
THE SOURCES: Show producer Alisa Bellettini says the best source for hot looks 
isn't any store: "Young rap kids on the street today dress better than anyone 
else around, and they do it with so little money." 
</P>
<P>
QUOTABLE: Giorgio Armani explains why he showed blue jeans on topless models: 
"I wanted the jeans to be the focus." Yes, he is serious. 
</P>
<P>
MORE QUOTABLE: Diana Vreeland, the late, preeminent fashion arbiter and editor 
of Vogue: "You don't have to be born beautiful to be wildly attractive." The 
show concludes with this comforting thought. FRANCINE PARNES

Question: Anyone who can read should know by now that sunbathing not only does 
not make a person more attractive but can do damage to the skin. 
</P>
<P>
Are there any other possible dangers to our appearance that we should be aware 
of? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Some of the factors that influence our appearance are beyond our powers 
to control. Age, for example, is one such factor. Others include heredity, skin 
type, and our general facial skeletal structure. 
</P>
<P>
However, other factors are within our control. These include exposure to 
sunlight, which you mention, as well as tobacco and alcohol use. In general, I 
believe that the greatest contribution to good looks is good health.

CHILLING WORLD OF PROGRAMMED PROCREATION

<TEXT>

The difficulty in making a movie about soullessness is not to make a soulless 
movie. "The Handmaid's Tale" (selected theaters), based on the 1985 Margaret 
Atwood novel about a futuristic America ruled by militant fundamentalists, 
doesn't entirely avoid the trap. It's a beautifully austere piece of work -- 
it's rare to see a film these days that's as carefully designed as this one. 
But the design hasn't been given enough human contours. It's as if the film 
makers had forgotten the raging emotions that all that design and austerity 
were supposed to repress. 
</P>
<P>
Atwood's cautionary conceit, which has been adapted by that auteur of austerity 
Harold Pinter and directed by Volker Schlondorff, is an ingenious confluence of 
modern paranoias. America has been overthrown by right wing religious fanatics. 
In the wake of nuclear accidents and pollution and other environmental 
disasters, all but one in a hundred women are infertile. Potential 
child-bearers are rounded up, indoctrinated into their new role as breeders, or 
"handmaidens," and then assigned to a Commander, or high government official, 
and required to mate with him at the peak of her monthly fertility. 
</P>
<P>
The copulation ceremony is taken from the Book of Genesis, where Rachel's 
handmaiden Bilhah served the same function. If the handmaiden doesn't become 
pregnant, she's banished to outlying work camps to clean up toxic waste along 
with minorities and non-believers and "gender offenders" (i.e. homosexuals). 
</P>
<P>
The film begins with a family being ambushed by government soldiers during an 
attempt to escape into Canada. (Atwood is Canadian; her book is an implicit 
knock at American society.) The husband is shot, the baby daughter is taken 
away, and the woman (Natasha Richardson), who tests positive for fertility, is 
sent to a Center and renamed Offred. 
</P>
<P>
The Handmaidens, all dressed in red habits, are lectured into submissiveness by 
the Aunts, dressed in brown. Assigned to a Commander (Robert Duvall), and his 
barren wife Serena (Faye Dunaway), who is dressed like all Commander's wives in 
blue, Offred settles into the ceremoniousness. But, unlike many of her sister 
handmaidens, she's resisted indoctrination. She goes through the motions, but 
her wariness is palpable. 
</P>
<P>
The color-coded world of "The Handmaid's Tale" is elegantly spare; it's a world 
where the written word, except for the Bible, has been banished and replaced 
with pictographs and bar codes. The near-abstract design, conceived by artist 
Jennifer Bartlett, is supposed to clarify the movie's meanings for us, but it 
has the effect of holding us at a remove. Atwood had a satirically kicky core 
to her conceit, but the film doesn't have enough bite to do it justice. 
Schlondorff and Pinter are determinedly unfunny. 
</P>
<P>
Atwood was positing the notion that radical feminism and fundamentalism meet in 
a netherworld of repressiveness. The anti-abortion, anti-pornography universe 
of "The Handmaid's Tale" is one in which women are relegated to strictly 
utilitarian functions: breeders, wives, whores. And all in the name of 
righteousness. It's a patriarchal theocracy, but with a feminist fillip -- by 
virtue of their child-bearing capacity, women are dominant in this society. Men 
are banished from the actual birthings; the punishment for rape has the 
offender thrown to a crowd of handmaidens and torn apart. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps one reason the movie seems so cold to the touch is that the film makers 
don't have enough feeling for the present to make a convincing cautionary tale 
about the future. The most successful futuristic fantasies are, of course, 
really about the here-and-now. 
</P>
<P>
"The Handmaid's Tale" doesn't engage us on enough present-tense levels so that 
we might see the shape of Atwood's scheme all around us. There should be an 
inevitability to the vision, but the film seems cooked up from the oddments of 
pop culture. It's straining for significance yet there's a dullness to the 
landscape. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that Natasha Richardson -- who is in almost every scene -- is 
an extremely acute and intelligent actress, Offred never draws us in. There's 
no emotional towline to her character. Her fears for her baby's fate, for 
example, come to the fore too late in the story, and then they fade away once 
again. When she experiences the illicit pleasures of lust with the Commander's 
chauffeur (Aidan Quinn), Offred should be transported -- it ought to be a 
spiritual awakening as much as a physical one. Instead, it's at best a 
revivifying romp. 
</P>
<P>
A few sequences suggest how good the film might have been. The Commander's 
huffy copulations with Offred, with the furious Serena stretched out behind her 
on the bed, scrutinizing her husband's face for any dread traces of pleasure, 
are morbidly nutty. When the Commander meets secretly with Offred in his study, 
they indulge in forbidden acts -- paging through old copies of "Vogue," playing 
Scrabble. Robert Duvall knows how to show off a martinet's smarmy side; he's a 
whiz at revealing the vulnerability in smarm. 
</P>
<P>
As the chief indoctrinator Aunt in the Center, Victoria Tennant suggests the 
human being that once inhabited her stiff dictator's mien. There's a trace of 
sadness in her sadism. Faye Dunaway is perhaps best of all. Serena can't abide 
her husband's infidelities, and she throws such a fear into him that she takes 
over the movie whenever she's around. It's a good mystical joke. Even in this 
most repressive of futureworld patriarchies, it's the wives who send their men 
running for cover. 
</P>
<P>
"The Handmaid's Tale" has the advantage of a gripping premise, and, with 
futuristic fantasies, sometimes that's all you need to keep audiences watching. 
It was true for "The Stepford Wives" and "Fahrenheit 451," both unsuccessful 
movies, and it's true of better films, too, like "Westworld." But there's so 
much oracular rigor in "The Handmaid's Tale" that you wonder what attracted the 
film makers to the project. It's as if the film was made out of a belief that 
drabness, and not fundamentalism, was the present and future evil. The film 
makers have capitulated to their own nullity.

Einstein News Footage Missing: Nearly 4,000 feet of film on Albert Einstein 
that was part of the University of South Carolina's Movietonews collection fell 
out the back door of a Federal Express delivery truck in Columbia, S.C., and 
has been missing for a week. 
</P>
<P>
"From a historical standpoint, it is absolutely irreplaceable," said Don 
McCallister of the university's News Film Library. The film shows Einstein 
appearing at events during the '30s. The university was sending the film to New 
Jersey to be copied for a French film maker. BETH KLEID

Sizzling Ticket Price for 'Miss Saigon': "Miss Saigon" promises to be a 
megaproduction when it opens at the Broadway Theater in New York next March. 
</P>
<P>
There'll be a helicopter landing on stage, a huge statue of Ho Chi Minh . . . 
and extra high ticket prices. The top ticket price for the best seats will be 
$100. Compare that to highest price at the Los Angeles Music Center Opera, $75; 
the top ticket (unscalped) for L.A "Phantom of the Opera," $50. BETH KLEID

'DANCES' DOES WELL AS MESSAGE, FALTERS AS PLAY

Stop-Gap's "She Also Dances" climaxes with Lucy -- a pretty, wheelchair-bound 
woman -- dancing with her friend, Ted. He lifts her from the chair, and they 
move, almost easily, across the stage. 
</P>
<P>
It's the play's gentle metaphor for overcoming handicaps and realizing our 
potential. It's also a symbol for what the Santa Ana-based troupe has offered 
as a message for several years with its therapy-oriented productions. 
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, "She Also Dances" has to be looked at in two ways. As a 
piece intended to present a hopeful picture of what we can become, no matter 
the barriers, it accomplishes Stop-Gap's most basic goal. 
</P>
<P>
As a theatrical experience, however, it is less successful. Kenneth Arnold's 
play, a slight piece of spoken doubts and epiphanies linked by soft-focused 
dances, is so small-framed it has trouble generating enough drama to carry 90 
minutes. It's heartfelt but wan; noble but predictable. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't to say that director Don R. Laffoon's actors (Ellen Stohl and J.D. 
Burns) lack effort. At Saturday's opening night, both tried hard -- often too 
hard, especially Burns, who didn't always communicate Ted's emotions in 
convincing ways -- to make the moments human and humane. 
</P>
<P>
Stohl, a disabled actress probably best known for appearing semi-nude in 
Playboy magazine in 1987, gave Lucy a degree of spunk that brought some grit to 
the proceedings. Lucy, a disabled debutante, fights her own anger and 
unhappiness to make the best of things, diluting much of her cynicism by play's 
end. 
</P>
<P>
She is aided by Ted, a gymnast who wants to become a dancer but worries whether 
he's good enough and whether people will think he's gay. Ted prods Lucy, and 
she pushes him to also follow his heart. 
</P>
<P>
The choreography, also by Burns, is measured and uncomplicated, but the 
execution had rough patches Saturday night. In his defense, the dances with 
Stohl require many lifts and must have been demanding. The gymnastic-oriented 
movements, also taxing, showed exertion as well. 
</P>
<P>
The tenderer dance sequences were accompanied by Patrick Brien's mellow 
lighting, all cast against Victoria Bryan's simple, monochromatic set that 
placed emphasis on the two actors. 
</P>
<P>
'SHE ALSO DANCES'

FISHBONE HOOKS FANS AT THE ROXY

<P>
Too few acts can drop an hour-plus of spankin' new material on an audience -- 
not once stooping to trite 'n' true call 'n' response routines -- and watch the 
sell-out crowd explode. 
</P>
<P>
At the Roxy on Monday, in the first show of a three-night stand, local sextet 
Fishbone proved itself a full-tilt, booty-bustin' member of this killer elite. 
</P>
<P>
After five years and a couple of albums and EPs, the original lineup -- and 
hey, let's hear it for loyalty and brotherhood in every sense of the word -- 
remains as eclectic and hyper-energetic as ever. 
</P>
<P>
Highlight of the new material -- most of which was pretty much your 
hardest-workin', interplanetary dance band's typical 
ska-funk-reggae-soul-rock-rap-beat-poetry with all the psychedelic trimmings -- 
had to be the too-Sly screaming yellow zonker "Everyday Sunshine." All this and 
they saved the "greatest hits" for the encores. DON WALLER

'Josephine Baker' Story: Fifteen years after her death, the story of Josephine 
Baker is going to make it to film -- as a TV movie for HBO. "This is a project 
that only pay-TV could do at this point," an HBO spokesman said, explaining 
that it will faithfully re-create the nudity in her stage act. 
</P>
<P>
Diana Ross had long been interested in a screen biography of the famed 
performer, but the pay-TV channel said Tuesday that Lynn Whitfield will have 
the title role. Whitfield -- whose credits include TV's "The Women of Brewster 
Place" and the film "Silverado" -- will perform some of Baker's musical numbers 
that made her famous in the music halls of Paris in the late '20s and '30s.

JAZZ NOTES: ROXY MUSIC IN THE VALLEY FROM A REAL-LIFE BAKER BOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>

Two San Fernando Valley jazz venues -- one new, one an established room -- have 
stepped in to fill the gap left when the popular Alfonse's in North Hollywood 
closed on Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
The established room is Chadney's (3000 W. Olive Ave., Burbank), where such 
jazz players and jazz-oriented singers as Jack Sheldon and Polly Podewell are 
being booked five nights a week. 
</P>
<P>
The new arrival is Roxy's, a two-level nightclub nestled in the Warner Center 
Hilton Hotel and Towers, 6360 Canoga Ave., Woodland Hills. The jazz policy at 
this high-tech room is under the direction of pianist John Hammond, who has 
served as the musical director for Carmen McRae, the Jackson Five, Lainie Kazan 
and "a whole lot of other people," and who was recently heard on the sound 
track playing Beau Bridges' piano parts in "The Fabulous Baker Boys." 
</P>
<P>
"My plan is to give the people real music on real terms, with no show-biz," 
says Hammond of his plans for Roxy's. "I want the high-quality player to come 
out and do what he does. There's nothing like this in the west end of the 
valley." 
</P>
<P>
The current policy calls for Hammond's trio, with bassist Tom Warrington and 
drummer Mark Pulice, to work Tuesdays-Fridays from 5:30-9:30 p.m, and Saturdays 
from 8:30 p.m.-12:30 a.m., with various guest artists. At present, reedman Ray 
Pizzi works Tuesdays, singer Cathy Segal-Garcia (Wednesdays and Saturdays) -- 
"She'll be my mainstay, particularly on the weekends" -- and saxophonist Tommy 
Newsom (Thursdays). Hammond will lead a quintet on Friday with various 
personnel. The room will impose neither a cover charge nor a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
As to why Hammond, 48, who has been accompanying Segal-Garcia regularly at 
Drake's in Glendale, wanted to run a room, he says, "I've played for everybody, 
and there comes a time when you have to do it for yourself. I just want to play 
good music with the best possible players." 
</P>
<P>
Though he's starting with area players who have solid followings, Hammond notes 
that "hopefully the hotel will want to get some larger names once they get the 
room on the map." 
</P>
<P>
The pianist, a native of Houston who has lived in Southern California 25 years, 
started out to be a concert artist when he discovered jazz. "It swept me away," 
he says. "I realized it was more important to express myself musically than to 
play everybody else's music." 
</P>
<P>
Hammond was thrilled to have "sidelined" (studio parlance for playing a musical 
part that is depicted by an actor on camera) Beau Bridges' piano parts in 
"Baker Boys." "It was the first thing I've done like that, I'm really excited 
about it and maybe it'll be a launching board," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Describing the process of creating the duo-piano parts that form the basis of 
Dave Grusin's Academy Award-nominated score, Hammond says, "Dave (who played 
Jeff Bridges' parts) and I just went in head to head and start playing. Nothing 
was written out, though we worked from sheet music. It was just, 'Well, how 
should we do this one?' Dave had to portray the Bill Evans-type player, who was 
played by Jeff Bridges, and they wanted me to portray his more substantial 
older brother. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't ask me to play badly, but they did ask me to play schmaltzy. Some 
of the outtakes are really hokey," he laughs. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond found he was "shocked" at the difficulty of some of his improvisations, 
which were later transcribed so that pianists Lou Forestieri and Joyce Collins 
could teach the Bridges brothers how to play their parts. "I would hate to have 
to read that stuff in the studio," he jokes. 
</P>
<P>
One outcome of Hammond's increased exposure through "Baker Boys" and Roxy's 
could be a solo album. "I'd like that," he says. "If not, I'll keep doing what 
I'm doing, have fun and make a dollar."

STATE MEDFLY PANELIST SAYS PEST IS IN SOUTHLAND TO STAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a harsh assessment of the state's war against the Mediterranean fruit fly, a 
key scientific adviser to the eradication program told the state Assembly on 
Tuesday that the pest has taken hold in Southern California and may be 
impossible to root out even with years of aerial spraying. 
</P>
<P>
James R. Carey, one of five members of the state's Medfly Science Advisory 
Panel, said his analysis of Medfly discoveries over the past 15 years indicates 
it has become "endemic" to parts of Los Angeles and Orange counties and almost 
certainly will become more entrenched. 
</P>
<P>
Carey's testimony came at an unusual hearing of the entire state Assembly, 
where top scientific and government experts were summoned to discuss the Medfly 
infestation, the health risks of spraying malathion and alternatives to use of 
the pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
The one-day Assembly hearing, convened as a "committee of the whole," provided 
the most high-profile examination to date of the Deukmejian Administration's 
handling of the eradication program, which began last August. 
</P>
<P>
With his controversial testimony, Carey provided politicians who oppose the 
spraying with additional scientific ammunition to continue attacking the 
eradication effort. 
</P>
<P>
Carey, a professor of entomology at UC Davis, told the legislators he believes 
the pattern of Medfly discoveries in the past shows the state's strategy has 
consistently failed and has little chance of success in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"It just hasn't worked; there's no way around it," said Carey. "We can knock 
the numbers down to a low level, but that's not eradication. They're still 
there." 
</P>
<P>
A parade of scientists and government officials, however, contradicted Carey's 
analysis and argued that California has succeeded in eradicating the fruit fly 
in the past -- most notably in the Santa Clara Valley in the early 1980s. Carey 
conceded that most of his fellow panel members don't support his position. 
</P>
<P>
"The eradication is working," said Henry Voss, director of the California 
Department of Food and Agriculture. "We did it then and I am confident we can 
do it now." 
</P>
<P>
Voss and Jack C. Parnell, deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, testified that failure to eradicate the fly in Southern California 
could lead to a devastating infestation in the fertile Central Valley, bringing 
with it the threat of greater use of pesticides and quarantines on California 
produce by other nations. 
</P>
<P>
If California abandons its eradication program, Parnell said, the U.S. 
government could be compelled to step in and resume the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
"The solution must be left to science and the best technology we have," said 
Parnell, who preceded Voss as California's director of food and agriculture. 
"If we cut and run because of emotional appeals, we will all lose." 
</P>
<P>
Carey, as one of the scientists advising state officials on the eradication, is 
one of the few insiders to question publicly the Department of Food and 
Agriculture's eradication strategy. 
</P>
<P>
If the fly has become entrenched in Southern California, as Carey believes, the 
state would be forced to consider two equally dire alternatives: embark on an 
even more intense spraying campaign or simply learn to live with the 
crop-destroying pest. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real dilemma," Carey said in an interview. "I understand the 
ramifications, but eventually, you've got to belly up to the problem and deal 
with it head-on. You can't pretend they're not there if they really are." 
</P>
<P>
Other entomologists, such as professors Kenneth Hagen and Donald Dahlsten of UC 
Berkeley, have made a similar argument in the past, and Dahlsten supported 
Carey in testimony before the Assembly on Tuesday. But agriculture officials 
largely have ignored them as isolated dissenters with little scientific 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Carey began his study because of one question that has nagged him ever since he 
joined the science advisory panel three years ago: Why are only some portions 
of California plagued with frequent infestations and not other parts of the 
country? 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture officials maintain that previous infestations were started by 
contaminated fruit mailed from overseas or brought into this country by 
tourists or immigrants. They say there are more Medfly infestations in the area 
because Los Angeles is one of the largest and most ethnically diverse areas in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
Carey, however, said he believes the arguments go against common sense. To 
begin with, there are other ethnically diverse regions, such as San Diego, that 
have rarely experienced an infestation. 
</P>
<P>
He said if travelers were to blame for bringing the Medfly into the country, 
why haven't other cities, such as Dallas or San Francisco, experienced as many 
infestations as Southern California? 
</P>
<P>
Carey began his study by mapping all 442 adult flies trapped over the last 15 
years in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The starting point was the 1975 infestation in Culver City -- the first in the 
state's history. That infestation was followed by an outbreak in 1980 around 
Northridge and another in 1981 near Baldwin Park. 
</P>
<P>
In each case, the state declared eradication of the fly after a program of 
aerial malathion spraying and sterile fly releases. 
</P>
<P>
The areas around Culver City, however, had new infestations in 1982, 1984, 
1986, 1987 and 1988. There also were new finds in Northridge in 1988 and 1989, 
and Baldwin Park in 1989 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only did it occur in the same county, but in the same cities and in some 
cases, the same neighborhoods," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Carey said he believes the recurring infestations show that the Medfly has 
never been eradicated, but only had gone undetected by the state trapping 
network. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a disease," he said. "Remission and cure are two very different 
things. We can spray this into remission, but we can't go on like that 
forever." 
</P>
<P>
Carey said there are other recurring pockets of Medflies that include parts of 
East Los Angeles and Westminster in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
After his testimony before the Assembly, officials from the state Department of 
Agriculture denounced his conclusions as "ridiculous" and "without scientific 
backing." 
</P>
<P>
Isi Siddiqui, the department's assistant director, said malathion spraying has 
eradicated the pest from many regions, some of which have gone for years 
without new infestations. 
</P>
<P>
He said the fast breeding of the fly defies Carey's claim that a small 
population of flies could exist undetected by the state's network of traps. 
Once the flies begin to breed, their numbers would be high enough in a few 
generations to assure that at least one would be trapped, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ridiculous for Dr. Carey to make these accusations," Siddiqui said in an 
interview, adding that a majority of the science advisory panel does not 
support Carey's findings. "The doctor doesn't have the data. He has a gut 
feeling, that's all." 
</P>
<P>
The delay between reinfestations is the biggest flaw in Carey's argument, 
Siddiqui continued. For example, after the Northridge infestation, it took 
eight years before trappers found another fly there. 
</P>
<P>
"Does that make sense?" Siddiqui asked. "You could have millions of flies in 
just three or four generations. Why didn't we find them?" 
</P>
<P>
The state is covered from one end to the other with Medfly traps and in the Los 
Angeles Basin there are five traps for every square mile. Siddiqui conceded 
that the traps are inefficient and a small population of Medflies could elude 
detection, but only until they began to breed and multiply. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the fly has established a permanent residence in Southern California, 
Siddiqui added, it would not change the Department of Food and Agriculture's 
resolve to eradicate the pest. "Living with the Medfly is simply unacceptable," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Director Voss told the Assembly that no new Medflies have been found in three 
weeks and he is "cautiously optimistic" the current eradication program is 
working. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to appease Southern Californians angered by the aerial spraying, 
Voss announced that the state will begin notifying residents by mail when their 
homes are to be sprayed -- a program that will cost $250,000 for each aerial 
treatment.

PARK ADVOCATES PRESSURE BOB HOPE FOR LAND GIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An impasse has emerged in the decade-old effort to piece together a sprawling 
national preserve in the Santa Monica Mountains, a stalemate setting proponents 
of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area against comedian Bob 
Hope, the largest private property owner in the range. 
</P>
<P>
While environmentalists and park officials are anxious to acquire the 
comedian's holdings, Hope has chosen to option most of his 7,400 acres to 
developers intent on building high-priced housing and golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
Park advocates contend that those developments would blemish their verdant 
surroundings, and have extensively lobbied the 86-year-old entertainer, 
philanthropist and political conservative to instead donate or sell his land to 
the reserve -- even though the National Park Service cannot meet his asking 
price. 
</P>
<P>
The disagreement, which has simmered behind the scenes for years, now threatens 
to spill over into public view as government agencies begin to consider 
developers' plans for Hope's major holdings inside the 155,000-acre park 
territory, which stretches from Point Mugu to Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
Hope's attorney said the comedian merely has chosen to exercise his prerogative 
to sell to the highest bidders, and calls it unfair to single Hope out for 
pressure. He said other major property owners in the mountains are not being 
pressured as vigorously as Hope. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Hope regards his properties as investments, and he is fully entitled to a 
fair return on them," said attorney Payson Wolff, who spoke at the comedian's 
behest. "It's presumptuous for people to say that he should give his land away. 
. . . If he wants to sell it, more power to him." 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists, who have inundated the comedian with calls and letters 
appealing to his sense of patriotism, counter that more than one man's property 
rights are at stake. They say that Hope's holdings are important enough to make 
or break the Santa Monica park system. 
</P>
<P>
"Of all the lands you can get in the mountains, Hope has the critical ones," 
said Joseph T. Edmiston, director of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, 
one of several agencies that works with the Park Service to identify and 
acquire public lands. "It's all-important." 
</P>
<P>
Found on Hope's acreage are coyotes, mountain lions, bobcats and other animals 
that would be threatened by development, park officials contend. Failure to 
obtain Hope's land also would prevent linking many of the hiking trails and 
campsites spread out along the oak-studded land. 
</P>
<P>
Topping the park's wish lists are two prime, picturesque properties owned by 
Hope: 1,100 acres of rolling meadowland in the Simi Hills section of Ventura 
County called China Flat, and a 339-acre oceanfront tract in Malibu's Corral 
Canyon. Park officials also are interested in Hope's Jordan Ranch near Agoura 
Hills and Runkle Ranch below Santa Susana Mountains Park. 
</P>
<P>
Hope, who is said to be worth about $150 million, started acquiring the land in 
the 1950s when he converted oil profits into real estate. Legend has it that he 
and his close friend, the late Bing Crosby, once stood atop the China Flat 
parcel and mused over the possibilities of developing it into a second Bel-Air. 
</P>
<P>
Hope never acted on that fantasy, opting instead to hang onto his increasingly 
valuable properties. Now the comedian is gradually liquidating in order to 
realize the profits from his land, said Wolff. 
</P>
<P>
The National Park Service concedes that it has never come close to meeting 
Hope's prices. Indeed, as a result of chronic funding shortages, park officials 
have obtained less than half of the overall property initially targeted for 
parkland acquisition, and one administrator has labeled the Santa Monica 
recreation area "an insult to the national park system." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Bob Hope or anyone else has anything to do with our problems," 
said Willis Kriz, chief of the Park Service's land resources division. "You are 
looking at overall budget constraints." 
</P>
<P>
This year's budget for buying land in the Santa Monicas is $12 million, an 
increase from $1 million in 1988. The conservancy, a state-funded environmental 
acquisition group, has another $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
But that's still small change in Southern California real estate terms. The 
Jordan Ranch alone has been appraised at $20 million to $30 million, a price 
tag that has helped explain why environmentalists have appealed to the 
comedian's legendary penchant for philanthropy. Hope is well-known for his work 
on behalf of the USO and other charitable causes. 
</P>
<P>
Time, however, is running out for park adherents. With Hope's blessing, Potomac 
Investment Associates is pushing ahead with plans to build 1,152 homes and a 
tournament-quality golf course on Jordan, which abuts China Flat. Another 
company, Sun Pacific Inc., hopes to convert Corral Canyon into a resort with a 
golf course. Both are operating under option agreements that give them the 
right to buy Hope's property if they are able to secure approval for their 
development plans, which must be obtained from county officials in Ventura and 
Los Angeles counties, respectively, and the state Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Other Hope properties in the park territory are already being developed. The 
Currey-Riach Co. recently built 1,200 condominiums and houses on a hilly tract 
north of Malibu Creek State Park that was purchased from Hope for $13 million. 
Another developer plans to build 75 homes, an office building and a shopping 
center on a 195-acre Calabasas ranch just obtained from Hope for $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We paid exactly what he wanted, which is the way he likes to do business," 
said the developer, Robert E. Zuckerman of Continental Communities. Yet another 
company, the Anden Group, wants to build 90 homes on another Hope parcel off 
Las Virgenes Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
Wolff said Hope, an avid golfer who owns a golf cart in the shape of his 
ski-nosed profile, is especially "thrilled" about plans for building golf 
courses on two of his properties. "Mr. Hope feels that it is a beautiful use of 
open space," the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
"Dealing with a legend definitely makes our job harder," said National Park 
Service Supt. David Gackenbach, who manages the Santa Monica park system. "It's 
true that it's his property. . . . But it sure would be nice if he donated at 
least one parcel." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the tax benefits involved, parkland bequests are fairly common. As 
an example, more than a third of the 11,000 acres acquired by the conservancy 
have been donated, Edmiston said. Hope's sole land donation in the Santa 
Monicas came before the national park system was formed, when he gave 360 acres 
of land to Ventura County. Other well-known donors include Dick Clark and actor 
Peter Strauss, who bequeathed part of the property for the open-to-the-public 
Peter Strauss Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Wolff said additional bequests are not on Hope's agenda. The comedian has 
already given a total of 1,500 acres of land in various locales, the attorney 
said, including the 80 acres that formed the site of the Eisenhower Medical 
Center in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Condemnation is another possible method government agencies have of attaining 
property. But park officials say they were scared off of that path by the 
experiences of the Las Virgenes Water Municipal District, which condemned a 
Hope property nearly a decade ago and wound up facing the comedian in court. In 
an episode that the comedian's attorney confirms, Hope shook hands with each of 
the jurors during the trial. The jury then awarded him exactly what he 
requested -- about $2 million more than the board wanted to pay. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians may also have learned from the water board's experience. Rep. 
Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles), a normally outspoken park advocate who 
authored the legislation creating the Santa Monica Mountains park system, will 
not discuss Hope's land. Neither will Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), who has 
acted as a conduit between Hope and park officials. 
</P>
<P>
Margot Feuer, a former state coastal commissioner who now belongs to an 
environmental group called Save the Mountain Park Coalition, contends that 
Hope's resistance to donating or selling his vast holdings to the park can be 
attributed to avarice. 
</P>
<P>
"No one has a larger ownership of land in the Santa Monicas, and yet has not 
given up one inch," Feuer said. "What is it that drives this man?" 
</P>
<P>
Hope's negotiations with public agencies over the years may help answer that 
question -- and show another side of the comedian's famous personality. "He 
wants top dollar for his property and then some," said one park bureaucrat. 
Another acknowledges that Hope is an "an absolute master" when it comes to 
business deals. 
</P>
<P>
Park officials first learned of Hope's bargaining skills in the early 1970s 
when he asked the state Department of Recreation and Parks if they wanted to 
buy the Hope Ranch in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,022-acre parcel is now part of Malibu Creek State Park. But state park 
records show that Hope drove a tough deal. He initially rejected the state's 
offer of $4.3 million, saying the property was worth at least $6 million. 
Hope's representative appealed the case all the way to then-Gov. Ronald Reagan 
before agreeing on a sale price of $4.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Les McCargo, the state recreation department's chief deputy, said Hope also 
tried to persuade the state to condemn the property, a designation that gives 
the seller a longer period to invest pretax profits. The state, however, denied 
the request, McCargo said. 
</P>
<P>
It was during that same period that Hope made his sole donation to the park 
system. Conejo Recreation and Park District manager Tex Ward said Hope 
bequeathed the nature preserve at the request of his department after it was 
judged to have limited development potential. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, Congress formed the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation 
Area with the goal of preserving open space in the corridor. The courting of 
Hope started soon after. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Hope, you are one of the great examples of the good that the Los Angeles 
area has given, and continues to give to this nation," then-park Supt. Robert 
S. Chandler wrote in a letter that set the tone for other obsequious overtures 
to come. "As such, your unfailing adherence to excellence and bettering the lot 
of mankind is exemplary in the United States and abroad. The Santa Monica 
National Recreation Area . . . is dedicated to similar goals." 
</P>
<P>
With the elusive Hope still outside the department's grasp, Daniel R. Kuehn, 
Chandler's successor, followed with this 1986 letter: "You probably remember my 
audacious request that your client Bob Hope donate to the National Park Service 
his land. . . . What with the golf tournament, the Super Bowl program and his 
many other activities and obligations (he is indeed an amazing man), I realize 
he probably has not had time to at all consider my request." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until 1988, when Ventura County Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer demanded 
an audience with Hope, that the much-anticipated meeting finally occurred at 
his Toluca Lake home. Schaefer, who has a vote on the Jordan Ranch development 
proposal, said she hoped to persuade Hope to sell both China Flat and Jordan 
Ranch to the Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer took Kuehn along to the hourlong meeting, which accomplished as little 
as the letters. "He was delightful," Schaefer said. "We talked about the 
property and the fact that the Park Service had tried to buy (it). He said it 
would make a beautiful golf course." 
</P>
<P>
The discussion continues, with the supervisors scheduled to vote on the Jordan 
plans later this year. The most controversial aspect involves a land swap in 
which Potomac Investment Associates would turn over the China Flat property to 
park officials for a site that would be used to build an access road linking 
Potomac's development to the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Some park advocates, including Edmiston, favor the deal because it guarantees 
that China Flat is preserved. Others, such as longtime environmental activist 
Mary Wiesbrock, argue that the land swap is a needless giveaway that paves the 
way for overdevelopment of an area that boasts fragrant black sage, 
yellow-flowering tarweed, mountain mahogany and valley oaks. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Park Service agrees to this, it will be a scandal," said Wiesbrock, 
director of Save Our Open Space. "We're appealing to Mr. Hope to sell the 
entire property to the park. We would like to see it named the Hope Family 
Forest. It's the best legacy he could leave." 
</P>
<P>
A similar dispute rages over the Corral Canyon site, and appears headed for the 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
A contingent of Malibu residents and environmentally oriented politicians were 
outraged when the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved plans for 
construction of a $35-million club, golf course and residential development on 
the site in December. Especially troubling to the opponents are plans by 
developer Sun Pacific to move 5 million cubic yards of dirt and fill in an 
entire canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal still faces state Coastal Commission review. But last month its 
foes added two lawsuits to its list of hurdles, alleging that the project will 
ruin the pristine canyon. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter reminiscent of those the park service has addressed to Hope in the 
past, actor Martin Sheen, Malibu's honorary mayor, suggested that a more 
fitting use of the canyon would be to preserve it and name it in Hope's honor. 
Sheen's letter failed to sway the developer, however, and Wolff said it is 
unlikely to sway Hope. 
</P>
<P>
Hope understands the environmental problems the developments may pose, Wolff 
said. But he does not feel that it is his responsibility to address them. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically it's the developer's problem," Wolff said. "They are the ones who 
have to (prove) nature won't be endangered. Mr. Hope doesn't have the technical 
knowledge for that kind of stuff." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BOB HOPE'S MAJOR PARK-AREA PROPERTIES 
</P>
<P>
These properties, which represent the bulk of Bob Hope's holdings in the Santa 
Monica Mountains, are at the heart of a dispute between Hope and park 
advocates. 
</P>
<P>
1. Runkle Ranch: 2,300 acres. Considered a vital link in the wildlife corridor 
between the Santa Susana Mountains and the Simi Hills, its jagged terrain makes 
development unlikely. The Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts is eyeing one 
of its canyons as a possible landfill site. 
</P>
<P>
2. China Flat: 1,100 acres. A rolling meadowland, it ranks high on the list of 
properties targeted for acquisition by park advocates. The Santa Monica 
Mountains Conservancy hopes to obtain the parcel through a land swap this year. 
Could be developed if the swap falls through. 
</P>
<P>
3. Jordan Ranch: 1,300 acres. Adjoins China Flat. Potomac Investment Associates 
has optioned the property and is seeking to build more than 1,000 homes and a 
golf course. The deal hinges on a land swap that would give China Flat to the 
park in return for a plot of land where Potomac hopes to build an access road 
from the development site to the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
4. Corral Canyon: 339 acres. Called the "crown jewel" of Hope's holdings, it 
overlooks the ocean and includes a running stream. Another top priority of park 
preservationists, it is optioned to Sun Pacific Inc., which proposes to build a 
golf course and resort on the land.

AF SAYS BYE-BYE BLACKBIRD AS SPY JET SETS RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The SR-71 Blackbird spy plane roared into history Tuesday with a record-setting 
cross-country flight and a roof-rattling sonic boom heard across Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The Mach 3 high-altitude jet flew from Los Angeles to Dulles International 
Airport near Washington in an official time of 68 minutes and 17 seconds. It 
averaged 2,112.52 m.p.h. on its way to retirement on permanent display at the 
Smithsonian Institution. 
</P>
<P>
The old record for coast-to-coast flight was 3 hours and 38 minutes, set in 
April, 1963, by an American Airlines Boeing 707 on a commercial flight from Los 
Angeles to New York. That plane averaged 680.9 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackbird, shaped like a pointy-nosed manta ray, is being retired for 
budgetary reasons after 25 years of secret service, Air Force officials said. 
Most of its highly classified photographic surveillance missions are now 
performed by spy satellites. 
</P>
<P>
The aircraft took off from its Mojave Desert airfield in Palmdale at Air Force 
Plant 42 at 4:30 a.m. PST. It flew out over the Pacific, was refueled for its 
transcontinental flight, then took a running start across the California 
coastline near Oxnard, accelerating to top speed with a massive blast as it 
broke the sound barrier. 
</P>
<P>
"It was awesome," Air Force Col. Tom Hornung said of the predawn liftoff from 
California. "It was a fitting end to a great Air Force program." 
</P>
<P>
The sonic boom was felt across a wide area north of Los Angeles, from Newhall 
to Van Nuys to as far west as Oxnard in Ventura County. Some police departments 
reported a rash of calls from people thinking it was an earthquake or an 
aftershock from last week's quake centered near Upland. 
</P>
<P>
The plane climbed from 60,000 feet as it burned off fuel, eventually reaching 
an altitude "in excess of 80,000 feet," said pilot Lt. Col. Raymond E. 
Yeilding, who was accompanied by reconnaissance systems officer Lt. Col. J. D. 
Vida. The pilot said tail winds of 6 knots were not a factor in the plane's 
speed. 
</P>
<P>
It crossed the East Coast east of Salisbury, Md., was refueled and then cruised 
into Dulles airport in Chantilly, Va., about 20 miles west of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Yeilding's Blackbird set three other point-to-point speed records: Los Angeles 
to Washington at 2,153.24 m.p.h., Kansas City to Washington at 2,200.94 m.p.h. 
and St. Louis to Cincinnati at 2,242.48 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The records were certified by the National Aeronautic Assn., keeper of the 
nation's aviation and space records, association President Malvern J. Gross Jr. 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The sinister-looking twin-engine SR-71 is the fastest, highest-flying 
production aircraft ever built. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems awfully ironic on the final flight of this aircraft to be setting 
these records," Gross said. "Usually, records are set at the beginning, not the 
very end of the program. One has to wonder whether it really makes sense to 
retire this aircraft." 
</P>
<P>
"Bye-bye, Blackbird," said Ben Rich, director of the Lockheed Aeronautical 
System Co.'s "skunk works" in Burbank who helped design the Blackbird. "I 
cannot honestly say this is a happy day for me." 
</P>
<P>
It was not a happy morning for a lot of other people, either, but for a 
different reason. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounded to me like an explosion and woke me out of a sound sleep," said 
Sgt. Denny Phillips of the Oxnard Police Department. "My next thought was it 
was an earthquake, like when you get those jolting kind of quakes. This thing 
was probably 10 times the magnitude of a shuttle landing and I've heard almost 
all the shuttle sonic booms." 
</P>
<P>
Police said calls reporting windows rattling and houses shaking started 
lighting up switchboards shortly after 6 a.m., primarily from communities in 
the Antelope and San Fernando valleys, where the sonic boom was heard the 
loudest. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank police officer Dan Crawford said he heard "one loud boom, although 
other people heard two. At first I thought it was the space shuttle coming in, 
but then I remembered it had already come down. It shook the windows pretty 
good." 
</P>
<P>
What they heard was SR-71 model No. 17972, which was headed for the 
Smithsonian. The donated plane will be displayed at a Dulles airport wing of 
the National Air and Space Museum. Eight other Blackbirds are going to museums; 
three will be given to NASA for aeronautical research, and three are being 
mothballed in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force officials have rarely displayed the plane, and many of its 
performance characteristics remain classified. The service will not even say 
how many of the planes were built. 
</P>
<P>
The spy plane ended its flight by diving to 200 feet above the Dulles runway as 
it screamed, with afterburners lit, past rows of dignitaries assembled for its 
retirement ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackbird has been a major source of aerial reconnaissance photographs of 
targets around the globe for U.S. military and intelligence agencies since it 
first began flying in 1964. The SR-71, which can outrun any fighter jet in the 
world, has never been shot down or captured. 
</P>
<P>
It succeeded the U-2 surveillance plane, one of which was shot down over the 
Soviet Union in May, 1960. Its pilot, Francis Gary Powers, was seized by the 
Soviets and pleaded guilty to espionage charges but was released two years 
later in a spy swap. 
</P>
<P>
The SR-71's old world record for absolute speed was 2,193 m.p.h. It also holds 
the record for sustained altitude in horizontal flight -- 85,069 feet. One 
Blackbird flew from New York to London in September, 1974, in 1 hour, 54 
minutes and 56 seconds at an average speed of 1,807 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>

they're giving one to the Smithsonian so generations of the future can see our

BLACKBIRD -- A SYMBOL OF COLD WAR RETIRES 
</P>
<P>
America's premier spy plane -- the SR-71 Blackbird -- broke four speed records 
as it headed for a final resting spot in the Smithsonian's National Air and 
Space Museum. 
</P>
<P>
After 25 years of supersonic snooping, the black, dagger-shaped aircraft 
flashed coast to coast in 68 minutes, 17 seconds -- three times faster than the 
old record of 3 hours, 38 minutes set in 1963 by a Boeing 707. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's flight set speed records of 2,153.24 m.p.h. between Los Angeles and 
Washington; 2,242.48 m.p.h. between St. Louis and Cincinnati, and 2,200.94 
m.p.h. between Kansas City and Washington. Sonic booms were reported in various 
communities along its flight path.

KOHL RETREATS, SAYS HE ACCEPTS POLISH BORDERS;

<TEXT>
<P>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, knuckling under to international pressure on the 
controversy over Poland's postwar borders, agreed Tuesday that a reunited 
Germany will recognize those borders. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl's chief of staff, Chancellery Minister Rudolf Seiters, said the West 
German government will propose a motion Thursday in the Bundestag, the lower 
house of Parliament, calling for a treaty between Poland and a unified Germany 
to formalize the existing frontier, which follows the line of the Oder and 
Neisse rivers from the Baltic Sea to Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
The chancellor also backed down on his demand that Poland agree to drop any 
claims for war reparations and guarantee the rights of ethnic Germans in Poland 
in exchange for a border guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
"Mistakes were made on all sides, including by me," Kohl told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The Polish government welcomed Kohl's change of heart but cautioned that it may 
not be enough. 
</P>
<P>
"It is undoubtedly a step concordant with our expectations," said Polish 
government spokesman Zbigniew Augustynowicz. "But it is not yet what Prime 
Minister (Tadeusz) Mazowiecki proposed. We will observe future developments." 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki had called on Kohl to issue a guarantee as leader of the West German 
government that a reunited German state would not seek to recover territory in 
western Poland that was part of the Germany before its defeat in World War II. 
Kohl had refused, saying that, legally, such matters had to be decided by the 
government of a reunited nation. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, meeting in Moscow with East German Prime 
Minister Hans Modrow, said he is glad that Kohl has "corrected" his failure to 
be specific. 
</P>
<P>
"I welcome that," Gorbachev said of the news from Bonn. "Lack of clarity on 
such a fundamental issue does not belong to serious policy." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, before meeting Modrow, Gorbachev had warned that any German 
move to recover territory in the east would be "fraught with serious 
consequences," according to the official news agency Tass. 
</P>
<P>
He and Modrow later declared after their talks that it would not be acceptable 
for a unified Germany to be a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Chairman Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.) of the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee said West Germany has now provided "necessary assurances" in support 
of the Polish border, and he dropped action on a sense-of-the-Senate resolution 
linking the question to U.S. recognition of a united Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe international pressure . . . contributed to Chancellor Kohl's 
decision to provide the necessary assurances on the Polish-German border," Pell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl's decision is also expected to defuse a potential rift with his 
government's coalition partners, the Free Democrats, and put to rest concerns 
that have arisen in much of Europe about the attitudes of a strong new Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl's aide, Seiters, said the chancellor's decision to back down was reached 
at a 3 1/2-hour meeting with the Free Democratic members of the government. 
</P>
<P>
Quoting from the motion that is to be offered Thursday, Seiters said: "The 
border question should be settled in a treaty between an all-German government 
and the Polish government that puts the seal on the reconciliation of the two 
peoples." 
</P>
<P>
He said the Polish people "should know that their right to live in secure 
borders will not be thrown into question by territorial claims by Germans, 
either now or in the future." 
</P>
<P>
The Bundestag motion, he said, would also call on the Parliament of East 
Germany to adopt an identically worded motion after the East German elections 
scheduled for March 18. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl's refusal to be pinned down before reunification had drawn criticism not 
only in Poland but also the Soviet Union, France and the United States. At 
home, he was criticized not only by the opposition Social Democrats but also by 
the Free Democrats, led by his foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who 
advocated assuaging Polish fears with a public declaration recognizing existing 
borders. 
</P>
<P>
Critics suggested that Kohl was jeopardizing the move toward unification by 
behaving more like a provincial politician than an international statesman with 
hopes of heading what will be the most powerful country in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush urged Kohl to make a clear renunciation -- on behalf of his 
government and a united Germany -- of all claims to territory east of the 
Oder-Neisse Line. 
</P>
<P>
The border question dates back to World War II. At the postwar Potsdam 
conference, the victorious Allied powers ceded to Poland large areas of Germany 
-- parts of Pomerania, Silesia and East Prussia -- to compensate for areas of 
eastern Poland annexed to the Soviet Union. More than 10 million Germans were 
resettled in what became East and West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The Germans who were resettled in West Germany formed a small but powerful 
political bloc that has generally voted conservative, mostly for Kohl's 
Christian Democrats or its associated party in Bavaria, the Christian Social 
Union. Political observers have suggested that Kohl's reluctance to guarantee 
the Polish border was basically an effort to avoid losing the support of these 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
The resettled Germans, many of whom hope someday to return to a homeland 
reincorporated into Germany, maintain that the border question is an open one 
pending a final peace treaty between Germany and the Allies. 
</P>
<P>
Their vote is important because of elections in West Germany scheduled for 
later in the year -- state elections followed by national elections in 
December. The results are expected to be close. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, the Soviet news agency Tass quoted Gorbachev as saying: "If anyone 
wants to use the reunification of the two Germanys to reanimate revanchistic 
plans, that is irresponsible policy fraught with serious consequences." 
</P>
<P>
Revanchism is defined as the revengeful spirit that moves a defeated nation to 
seek aggressively the restoration of lost territories. Kohl and Bush have both 
taken the position that a united Germany should continue to be a member of 
NATO, but Gennady I. Gerasimov, spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry, told 
reporters Tuesday that Gorbachev has "dismissed the idea of a united Germany 
remaining in NATO." 
</P>
<P>
He quoted Gorbachev as saying, "It is clear to us that it does make a 
difference if a united Germany is to be a NATO member."

J. DAVID EXECUTIVE GETS 10-YEAR TERM FOR EVADING TAXES 
</P>

<P>
Nancy Hoover Hunter, convicted of four counts of tax evasion in connection with 
the J. David &amp; Co. investment fraud, was sentenced Tuesday to 10 years in 
federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, 51, a former top executive with the failed La Jolla investment firm, 
begged U.S. District Judge Earl B. Gilliam for mercy, crying and holding on to 
a lectern for support as she said she was "terribly sorry for all the pain and 
suffering I've caused." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter's attorneys had pleaded with Gilliam to view her conviction apart from 
the complicated J. David fraud, which bilked about 1,500 investors of about $80 
million from 1979 to 1984. 
</P>
<P>
But Gilliam said the case was "a little more than an income-tax violation 
case." The judge added, "We have in this case the motive, the extravagance and, 
uppermost, the people who were hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam, who could have sentenced Hunter to 20 years in prison, added a 
five-year probation term after the 10-year prison sentence concludes. But he 
did not impose a fine. The judge said he was not ready to consider when Hunter 
would be eligible for parole. 
</P>
<P>
The giant J. David fraud involved a Ponzi scheme in which money from new 
investors was used to pay off old investors and little actual trading was done. 
Prosecutors allege that Hunter created false documents to lure investors to J. 
David and then to lull them into staying put while the firm slid toward a 
bankruptcy that was declared in February, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter's former lover, firm founder J. David (Jerry) Dominelli, pleaded guilty 
in 1985 to fraud and tax evasion in connection with the scheme and is serving a 
20-year sentence in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
A jury convicted Hunter Dec. 11 of the four tax counts -- out of 197 total 
charges. It acquitted her of one other tax charge but deadlocked on 192 other 
counts, primarily fraud and conspiracy stemming from her role at J. David. 
</P>
<P>
The tax charges involved nearly $2 million that Hunter failed to report on her 
personal income taxes for the years 1980 through 1983, evading nearly $1 
million in taxes. At the trial, Hunter said Dominelli had assured her he would 
take care of any tax. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have said they intend to go to trial again on the 192 counts. A May 
1 trial date has been set. When the second trial ends, Hunter faces yet another 
trial on securities violations connected to the J. David case.

HARRIS ARGUES AGAINST ROLE FOR GOVERNOR; 
</P>
<P>
DEATH PENALTY: KILLER SCHEDULED TO BE EXECUTED APRIL 3 SAYS DEUKMEJIAN COULD 
NOT BE IMPARTIAL AND ASKS HIM NOT TO PRESIDE AT CLEMENCY HEARING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Condemned killer Robert Alton Harris, saying a politician "committed to my 
execution" should not decide whether he should be spared from the gas chamber, 
is asking Gov. George Deukmejian not to preside at his clemency hearing. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the governor dated Monday and obtained by The Times, Harris said 
he did not think Deukmejian could make a "fair and impartial" evaluation of his 
clemency request. 
</P>
<P>
Harris said there were several reasons why he had reached that conclusion, most 
obviously that Deukmejian is the author of the 1977 law reinstating the death 
penalty in California -- the one used to sentence Harris to die. Among the 
other factors was what Harris called Deukmejian's "publicly stated prejudgment" 
not to grant clemency. 
</P>
<P>
Although the letter actually was prepared by Harris' lawyers, "the sentiments 
expressed are mine," Harris said in it. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Deukmejian nor his staffers were available for comment on the letter, 
which was released late Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
The clemency hearing is to be held March 27. Harris, 37, is scheduled to be 
executed April 3 for the 1978 murders of two San Diego teen-agers. He would be 
the first person executed in California in 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
Harris wrote Deukmejian a letter in late January requesting clemency, claiming 
he has shown during more than a decade on Death Row that he can "play a 
positive role" if he is allowed to live out his days in prison. 
</P>
<P>
In response, Deukmejian announced Feb. 22 that he would convene a clemency 
hearing at San Quentin, the site of California's Death Row and gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, Deukmejian will have to obtain approval from the state Supreme 
Court if he decides to grant clemency. 
</P>
<P>
Contending in his Monday letter that he wishes only a "fair opportunity to 
present my case," Harris said he had to ask Deukmejian to withdraw from the 
clemency hearing because it was "clear" he could not get an "impartial and fair 
evaluation" of his request if the governor presided. 
</P>
<P>
Citing Deukmejian's "longtime, vigorous support" of capital punishment, Harris 
referred to the 1977 death penalty law and said, "I know the issue of 
reinstating and implementing the death penalty in California has been important 
to your political career." 
</P>
<P>
Harris also noted that Deukmejian -- the state attorney general before being 
elected governor in 1982 -- took part in prosecuting the first rounds of 
Harris' appeals in state and federal court. That role creates a conflict of 
interest, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
If a prosecutor successfully pursued a case, was elevated to the bench and then 
had to sentence the same defendant, there would be a conflict of interest that 
would bar the new judge from presiding at the sentencing hearing, Harris said. 
"I think the same analogy applies to my case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Harris said, Deukmejian indicated long ago that his mind was made up 
when it came to a request for clemency. Harris' letter cited a United Press 
International story from Deukmejian's 1982 gubernatorial campaign that reported 
Deukmejian had "promised not to interfere with an execution if he's elected 
governor," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
Harris ended his letter by saying he would appreciate it if Deukmejian would 
respond to his request promptly. "Time is of the essence," the letter said.

KOVIC WON'T RUN AGAINST DORNAN, 2 DEMOCRATS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
After two months of anxious speculation and growing national attention, 
anti-war activist and Hollywood celebrity Ron Kovic told Democratic associates 
Tuesday that he will not run for Congress against Rep. Robert K. Dornan this 
year, two of the associates said. 
</P>
<P>
But Kovic, whose life story is chronicled in the movie, "Born on the Fourth of 
July," seemed to be avoiding public attention Tuesday as the media and 
Washington political officials sought confirmation of reports of his decision. 
</P>
<P>
The 43-year-old author declined to comment to a Times photographer who found 
him at an outdoor pay telephone in Hermosa Beach. Later, he told a reporter who 
found him in the same area window shopping at an antique store that his plans 
for running go "back and forth." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to make any statement right now," Kovic said. "In fact, I'm 
trying to get some peace and quiet right now to think about it." 
</P>
<P>
But two of Kovic's associates said he was unequivocal when telling them of his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him what should I tell (reporters) . . . and he said, 'Tell them I'm 
not running.' That was the extent of it. He did not elaborate," said Tim 
Carpenter, an Orange County Democratic activist who was helping prepare a Kovic 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Sidney Galanty, a Democratic political consultant in Los Angeles and friend of 
Kovic's, said Kovic told him Tuesday that he would not run. "I'm really 
disappointed," Galanty said. "It would have been a great campaign." 
</P>
<P>
The deadline for Kovic to enter the race is Friday and speculation about his 
decision grew after he returned last Friday from a two-week European film tour. 
</P>
<P>
Without Kovic, Democratic officials said Friday they have no candidate in 
position to challenge Dornan. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan said Tuesday that he would not be surprised if Kovic did not run. 
</P>
<P>
The congressman, however, has been campaigning against Kovic "and the Hollywood 
Left." In January, Dornan sent out a campaign letter that included a picture of 
Kovic burning a draft card.

JUSTICES CURB STATE CASE APPEALS TO U.S. COURTS; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: THE SUPREME COURT REVERSES A 25-YEAR TREND. DEATH ROW INMATES ARE EXPECTED 
TO FIND THEIR ABILITY TO DELAY EXECUTIONS SEVERELY LIMITED.

<P>
For the last 25 years, the federal courts have offered a second chance to Death 
Row inmates. 
</P>
<P>
Federal judges were empowered to take a second look at state criminal 
convictions and to overturn those that violated the U.S. Constitution. Critics 
said this two-track system of court reviews led to endless appeals and years of 
delay. Even the most brutal and pitiless murderer, properly convicted and 
sentenced to die, could keep his case tied up in appeals for 10 years or more, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents said this system helped assure that only those persons properly 
convicted and sentenced would be executed. 
</P>
<P>
This week, the critics appear to have won. In two decisions announced Monday, 
the Supreme Court sent a clear message: Once a prisoner's conviction has been 
upheld on an initial appeal, neither a federal judge nor the Supreme Court will 
come to his rescue. 
</P>
<P>
Federal judges may not apply new interpretations of the Constitution to 
overturn past convictions or sentences. And the Supreme Court will no longer 
apply its rulings retroactively to free Death Row inmates. 
</P>
<P>
Foes of the death penalty were outraged. 
</P>
<P>
"This means we will have blatantly unconstitutional executions," said Stephen 
Bright, director of the Southern Prisoners Defense Committee in Atlanta. "I 
thought we would never get to a point in this country where the Supreme Court 
would say that." 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Legal Foundation, which supports the death penalty, countered 
that the rulings will get federal judges out of state court matters. 
</P>
<P>
"The court has made clear it wants to stop these endless appeals. They are 
saying that 'due process' does not mean endless process," said Alan Slobodin, 
general counsel for the legal studies division. 
</P>
<P>
Under the previous rules, a prisoner could win a new trial at any time he could 
show his conviction or sentence was unconstitutionally tainted. Now, a prisoner 
can win a new trial or sentencing only if he shows that his conviction or 
sentence was clearly unconstitutional at the time it was imposed. 
</P>
<P>
The two cases decided Monday illustrate both aspects of the court's new 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Horace Butler, a South Carolina man, was arrested for an assault, 
questioned by police and retained a lawyer. A few days later, the police, 
without consulting his lawyer, questioned him about an unsolved murder. Based 
on his answers, he was convicted and sentenced to die. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the Supreme Court ruled that this sort of police questioning violated 
the Miranda doctrine and was unconstitutional. But on Monday, the court 
nonetheless upheld Butler's death sentence, saying his conviction was not 
unconstitutional when it was handed down 10 years ago. (Butler vs. McKellar) 
</P>
<P>
A second decision upheld the death sentence of Robyn Leroy Parks. In 1979, the 
Oklahoma jury that sentenced him was told it should not be swayed by "any 
influence of sympathy" for him. His lawyers contended this instruction was 
unconstitutional. The Supreme Court had never ruled squarely on this issue, but 
last year, a federal appeals court in Denver ruled for Parks and ordered a new 
sentencing hearing for him. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the high court reversed that decision and said the federal judges in 
Denver had no authority to set a new interpretation of the law in this case. 
(Saffle vs. Parks) 
</P>
<P>
The two decisions mark a triumph for Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. First 
appointed as a law-and-order justice by President Richard M. Nixon in 1971, 
Rehnquist was elevated to the chief justiceship by President Ronald Reagan in 
1986. He has long complained that the federal courts meddle too much in the 
affairs of the states. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Rehnquist originated a controversial proposal to change federal law 
so as to give Death Row inmates only one, six-month chance to appeal their 
cases in the federal courts. That proposal is to be considered by the Senate 
later this month. 
</P>
<P>
But the two 5-4 rulings issued by the court Monday go a long way toward 
achieving what Rehnquist has sought in the new legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's decisions leave only two possibilities for a Death Row inmate to get 
the attention of the federal court: 
</P>
<P>
First, a prisoner whose conviction has just been affirmed by his state supreme 
court can appeal directly to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
For example, after the California Supreme Court upheld a death sentence in 1988 
for Riverside murderer Richard Boyde, he appealed directly to the Supreme 
Court, contending the instructions given to his jury were unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
The justices hear fewer than 2% of such appeals, but Boyde gained a hearing. 
However, the court ruled against him Monday on a 5-4 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Secondly, prisoners such as Boyde still retain the right to try to show a 
federal court at any time that they were convicted under procedures that even 
then were considered blatantly unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
In the Habeas Corpus Act of 1867, Congress said federal courts may act on pleas 
from persons held "in custody in violation of the Constitution." In the 1960s, 
the Supreme Court said this law gave the federal courts broad power to examine 
criminal convictions in the states. But the high court has now reversed 
direction. Federal courts will no longer come to the rescue of state Death Row 
inmates except in rare circumstances.

Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo, responding to the recall of U.S. 
Ambassador Thomas Stroock for consultations on a deteriorating human rights 
situation in Guatemala, charged that U.S. policy is unfair and inconsistent. 
</P>
<P>
"The attitude of the United States is unjust and unfairly critical," Cerezo 
said. "We didn't hear this kind of criticism with dictatorships in the past." 
Cerezo was elected in 1985, ending 17 years of military rule. Stroock hit a 
nerve last week when he said that the failure to bring charges in a series of 
assassinations and kidnapings could imperil U.S.-Guatemala relations.

LABOR PARTY DEMANDS DECISION TODAY ON PEACE TALKS; 
</P>
<P>
ISRAEL: IT WANTS LIKUD TO AGREE TO A U.S. PLAN. REJECTION MAY BRING DOWN THE 
COALITION GOVERNMENT.

<P>
Stung by conditions set down by their coalition partners, leaders of Israel's 
Labor Party demanded Tuesday that the stalemate over peace talks with the 
Palestinians be decided at a Cabinet meeting today. 
</P>
<P>
Rejection by the rightist Likud Party of a U.S. formula to move ahead with 
preliminary talks could bring down the 15-month-old unity government. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides accused the other of ultimatum politics. Commenting on Labor's 
demand for the Cabinet decision, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens of Likud said, "I 
believe in ultimatums from enemies but not from friends." 
</P>
<P>
Labor leader Shimon Peres called for a positive response to the American 
formula at this morning's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Not reaching a decision means the end of the process," he said, "and that 
calls for conclusions on the future of the government." 
</P>
<P>
A Labor insider said Peres will convene top party officials Thursday if the 
effort fails. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir's spokesman said he agreed to today's meeting of the so-called Inner 
Cabinet of top ministers from both parties. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to cut short political maneuvering on the volatile question was 
triggered by Likud's terms, set out early Tuesday after a grueling five-hour 
meeting at Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Jerusalem home. 
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Yossi Ahimeir, a Shamir aide, said that Likud favors the 
American proposal but that Israel should speak with "one voice" on the peace 
process. It also insisted that Labor agree on two "essential and basic issues: 
guaranteeing Israeli sovereignty over the whole of Jerusalem (and) preventing 
the Palestine Liberation Organization from taking over the process." 
</P>
<P>
Peres, the deputy prime minister, rebuffed the terms as negative and 
unresponsive to the f ormula put forward by U.S. Secretary of State James A. 
Baker III on how to choose Palestinian representatives to begin the talks. The 
American plan is designed to permit selection of some Palestinians who have 
been deported from the occupied territories or have residences or offices in 
East Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Likud) were asked yes or no," Peres said. "So what are they trying to 
do, some mudslinging at the Labor Party? We won't agree to this." 
</P>
<P>
"Chutzpah," he labeled the Likud demands, which appear to run counter to Labor 
positions on the voting rights of Palestinians in East Jerusalem and the 
anticipated role of the PLO in the proposed talks. 
</P>
<P>
In party meetings Saturday and Monday, the Likud ministers insisted that an 
Israeli delegation break off any talks at the first sign that the PLO is 
participating even behind the scenes or if the Palestinian delegation proclaims 
allegiance to the organization. Far-right members of the party opposed any 
talks at all, arguing they would open a door that would eventually lead to a 
Palestinian state in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
Labor leaders have acknowledged that even in the early stages of the process, 
Palestinian representatives would likely be indirectly advised by the PLO. And 
West Bank and Gaza Palestinians expected to be among the nominees for 
preliminary talks have said the PLO must help form and announce the Palestinian 
list. 
</P>
<P>
PLO leader Yasser Arafat, traveling in Malaysia, said a PLO presence in the 
talks, proposed for Cairo, is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
"With whom are they (the Israelis) . . . going to make talks?" he asked 
reporters. "With ghosts or the invisible men or an invisible delegation?" 
Shamir, he said, "can't hide the sun with his finger." 
</P>
<P>
Labor and Likud leaders are also divided on the question of participation of 
Palestinians from East Jerusalem in the peace process. Baker's formula is 
designed to bridge that gap. 
</P>
<P>
While both parties insist that a unified Jerusalem as the Israeli capital is 
non-negotiable, Labor leaders favor allowing a few Palestinians from the 
eastern half of the city, annexed after it was captured from Jordan in the 1967 
Arab-Israeli War, to join the preliminary talks under the Baker compromise. 
</P>
<P>
They also favor East Jerusalem voters taking part in later elections as part of 
the process to decide the future of the occupied territories. There are 140,000 
Palestinian voters in East Jerusalem, noted Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, 
Labor's No. 2 leader. "What are we going to do, annex them?" 
</P>
<P>
Rabin was particularly agitated by the implication in Likud's demands that 
Labor is not as firm on Jerusalem's indivisibility. He said that more top 
leaders of Labor were instrumental in unifying the capital by force of arms in 
the 1967 war than were the Likud leaders. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler sidestepped all 
questions about the Likud-Labor differences, saying only that "we are waiting 
for an answer from the Israeli government." 
</P>
<P>
Baker himself told reporters: "They are trying to resolve some fairly thorny 
problems that they have within their government. I think they are working hard 
and in good faith to resolve those problems. . . . What we would like to see is 
for them to give us a positive answer so that we can move forward toward a 
dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians." 
</P>
<P>
White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu, addressing a conference of the Simon 
Wiesenthal Center, the Los Angeles-based group that searches out Nazi war 
criminals, reiterated the Administration's general support for Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"(The Administration) is fundamentally committed to the security of the state 
of Israel," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Sununu drew applause for his reaffirmation that "this Administration 
is opposed to an independent Palestinian state" on the West Bank, the crowd 
fell silent when he emphasized that it could not support new Israeli settlement 
in areas troubled by the intifada.

The final prosecution witnesses in the Joseph Hazelwood trial in Anchorage 
testified that the Exxon Valdez skipper drank enough vodka to impair judgment 
before the tanker sailed, and that he risked capsizing by rocking the ship back 
and forth after the helmsman drove it onto a reef. Alaska Superior Court Judge 
Karl Johnstone refused to allow testimony from a state investigator assigned to 
guard Hazelwood after the March 24 grounding. The judge said the guard should 
not have questioned Hazelwood without his lawyers.

The Internal Revenue Service has served summonses on criminal defense attorneys 
around the country demanding that they reveal the names of clients who paid 
their fees with cash, an IRS official confirmed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers argue that such disclosures would violate the fundamental right of 
attorney-client privilege. 
</P>
<P>
The attorneys were told to bring their financial records to IRS offices, said 
Miami attorney Neal Sonnett, president of the National Assn. of Criminal 
Lawyers. One lawyer served said an IRS agent told him that 900 lawyers were to 
receive summonses. 
</P>
<P>
"We have heard from enough lawyers around the country to recognize that it 
appears to be a nationwide assault upon criminal defense lawyers," Sonnett 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In October, the IRS sent letters to about 940 criminal defense attorneys 
requesting information on clients who paid them more than $10,000 in cash, 
Sonnett said. The letters, signed by Christopher J. Lezovich, an IRS official 
in Detroit, was sent to attorneys around the country giving them 30 days to 
identify the clients. It also included a warning that non-compliance would 
result in summonses. 
</P>
<P>
Lezovich confirmed Tuesday night that summonses had been issued. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS is acting under a disclosure law passed by Congress in 1985. The law, 
initially widely ignored, was aimed at exposing tax evaders, including major 
drug dealers who often transact business in cash.

FBI LEAKED DATA ON SUSPENDED AGENT, HIS LAWYER SAYS 
</P>

The lawyer for veteran FBI agent Fernando E. Mata charged Tuesday that the FBI 
leaked information that it was investigating Mata for contacts with Cuban 
intelligence agents. Purpose of the leak, the lawyer said, was to send "a 
chilling message to any FBI agent who wants to stand up and tell the truth." 
</P>
<P>
Hugo A. Rodriguez, Mata's lawyer and a former FBI agent himself, said the 
reported action against Mata, who was suspended with pay about six weeks ago, 
amounts to retaliation for his participation in a landmark discrimination suit 
against the bureau won by Latino agents in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Davenport, the FBI's chief spokesman, denied that "the FBI leaked the 
information to anyone" and said the placing of Mata on administrative leave "is 
totally unrelated" to the agent's participation in the discrimination suit. 
</P>
<P>
But Davenport declined to explain Mata's suspension because of "privacy 
considerations." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reason, the action against Mata seems to have rekindled the 
tension and uncertainty among some of the FBI's Latino agents that plagued the 
bureau when the discrimination suit was being tried. The reaction partly 
reflects the stature of Mata, who was awarded the attorney general's 
distinguished service award in 1983 for his counterintelligence work. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Perez, the lead plaintiff in the class-action discrimination suit and now 
deputy assistant director of the FBI's laboratory division, said: "An official 
bureau investigation is involved, and, therefore, I'm precluded from 
commenting." 
</P>
<P>
But Leo Gonzalez, an agent who retired in December after 19 years with the FBI, 
scoffed at the inquiry being conducted of Mata's intelligence work. "I know 
Fernando very well, and I consider Fernando a very loyal American. When he 
talks about this country, tears come to his eyes. When he talks about the FBI, 
tears come to his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"To believe he would spy for the Cubans is abhorrent," Gonzalez said. "This is 
part and parcel of a pattern of reprisal" against agents who took part in the 
successful attack on the FBI's treatment of Latino agents. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure of the scrutiny of Mata for his alleged contacts with agents of 
the Cuban DGI intelligence service comes amid reports of stepped-up efforts by 
the Cubans to penetrate the FBI through Latino agents. A government 
intelligence source confirmed the recruitment, reported by the Washington 
Times, has been going on. 
</P>
<P>
A source familiar with the Mata inquiry said it dates back several years -- 
before the discrimination suit. 
</P>
<P>
Mata's lawyer, Rodriguez, who talked with reporters outside the federal 
courthouse in Miami, said he advised his client against appearing with him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of difficult living in this community and accepting the ambiguous 
charges," Rodriguez said, referring to the hostility of the Cuban community in 
Miami toward anyone suspected of supporting Fidel Castro's government. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez also said that Mata, as a veteran of counterintelligence work, did 
not want his picture taken. 
</P>
<P>
A source familiar with the Mata case said Mata had submitted to polygraph 
examinations by the FBI with the assurance that results were for an 
administrative inquiry and would not be used in any criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said the investigation has been going on for more than three years, 
"when they began close scrutiny of his activities for the past 15 years. But I 
guarantee you that there will be no criminal charges." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said he has received information that he also is under investigation 
for having leaked classified material. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said he did not know if Mata had been approached by Cuban 
intelligence agents. He said it was possible, "because that's the field that he 
worked in. If you work in narcotics, you talk to dopers."

BENNETT SCOFFS AT 'TOUCHY-FEELY' APPROACH TO DRUG PREVENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Decrying "touchy-feely exercises designed to enhance self-esteem," federal drug 
czar William J. Bennett on Tuesday called for more stringent anti-drug policies 
inside schools and drug education that stresses resistance to peer pressure. 
</P>
<P>
The former education secretary, in a speech at George Mason University that his 
aides billed as "a major address on drug education," said efforts "that never 
manage to curtail drug use ultimately contribute to public cynicism about drug 
prevention." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, director of the office of national drug control policy, said that 
"many students who have taken drug education courses -- even the best such 
courses -- have later gone on to use drugs," some only a few hours after 
attending an anti-drug class. 
</P>
<P>
Experts agree "that simply presenting information to students doesn't steer 
them away from drug use," he continued. "If anything, well-packaged information 
on drugs can even serve to pique youthful curiousity about them." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett directed his harshest words against "the vague and old-fashioned 
bromides of dime store political science -- all that 'feeling good about 
oneself' and 'nonjudgmental decision making,' all that clinical, antiseptic 
information sharing, on the one hand, and mushy, therapeutic 
confidence-building on the other." 
</P>
<P>
"Sound prevention efforts should be made of better, sterner, more resilient 
stuff," said Bennett, who as the nation's top education official in the Ronald 
Reagan Administration often stirred controversy with comments critical of 
educators' performance. 
</P>
<P>
He described as most encouraging drug education that emphasizes "learning how 
to say no to peers. Peer resistance is rooted in the very sensible view that 
many young people don't see themselves as vulnerable and are often more likely 
to follow the actions of friends than heed the warnings of parents and 
teachers." 
</P>
<P>
Such an approach, however, is not "the drug education equivalent of the polio 
vaccine," Bennett said. While peer resistance is able to dissuade some students 
from using drugs, he said it is crucial "to determine how well it works, when 
it works and also when it does not work." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett cited a drug education program in a Washington state school that 
appeared to be a model. But it was learned that after school, as many as 70% of 
the student body used drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"What was wrong here . . . was the absence of any clearly established school 
policy about drug use -- an explicit message about the rules of school and an 
implicit message about the rules of society," Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
He urged adoption of "unambiguous, straightforward and consistently applied" 
policies: "If you use drugs, your parents will be notified, and you will be 
suspended. Repeat offenders face expulsion. Readmittance is often conditioned 
on a written promise to stay away from drugs, and to undergo counseling or 
treatment where appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement has a critical role in preventing drug use, especially among 
students, Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
"In a neighborhood where a teen-ager is likely to be offered drugs two, three 
or four times on his way home from school, tough rules and how to say no will 
not be enough for some of our students," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett recalled his tour two weeks ago of a drug-ridden neighborhood in Los 
Angeles where police barricaded some streets and operated patrols that 
cooperated with neighborhood watch groups. 
</P>
<P>
Crime dropped and school attendance went "way up," he said. "Perhaps as many as 
200 additional students went to school once a police presence was established. 
. . . If that isn't drug prevention, then I don't know what is."

The countdown to nuclear disaster gained four minutes Tuesday when The Bulletin 
of Atomic Scientists reset its "Doomsday Clock" to reflect the easing of 
superpower tensions. 
</P>
<P>
"The likelihood of a full-scale nuclear holocaust has been reduced," said 
Leonard Rieser, chairman of the board of directors, before he pushed the 
clock's minute hand back to 10 minutes before midnight. 
</P>
<P>
Recent revolutionary changes in Eastern Europe and Soviet leader Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's commitment to helping lift the Iron Curtain led the magazine's 
board to change the clock for the eighth time in its 43-year history, Rieser 
told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The bronze, 18-inch clock hangs in the Bulletin's headquarters on the 
University of Chicago campus. Its hour hand is always positioned at midnight, 
symbolizing doomsday, and the minute hand is superimposed on a map of the 
world.

TEMPORARY HALT IN MEDFLY SPRAYING IS WIDELY BACKED

Most Californians think the Deukmejian Administration should temporarily halt 
the aerial spraying of malathion until more studies can be conducted into 
possible health hazards of the pesticide, according to the Los Angeles Times 
Poll. 
</P>
<P>
During the moratorium, citizens think, the state should use "safer methods" of 
trying to eradicate the Mediterranean fruit fly -- presumably by releasing 
larger numbers of sterile Medflies. 
</P>
<P>
The Times poll represented the first statewide measure of public opinion about 
malathion spraying in Los Angeles and Orange counties. Telephone interviews 
were conducted with 2,058 California adults from Feb. 24 to March 1. The margin 
of error was three percentage points in either direction. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether they thought there should be a temporary halt to the Medfly 
spraying or if it should be continued, 57% of those interviewed favored a halt 
-- and 36% said they felt "strongly" about their view. Only 35% believed the 
spraying should continue. The remaining 8% were not sure. 
</P>
<P>
Even in the Central Valley -- which as the state's biggest producer of crops 
stands to lose the most from a widespread Medfly infestation -- the majority of 
people favored a moratorium. Every region of California, in fact, supported a 
moratorium. Los Angeles County was the most adamant, with 62% demanding a halt 
to the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Across the state, a spraying moratorium was supported particularly by political 
liberals, younger people, blacks and Latinos. But business executives were less 
opposed to spraying than the average. And Republicans generally tended to be 
more sympathetic toward the spraying.

SECOND BID TO BAR SPRAYING FAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Attorneys for homeless people in Garden Grove lost a second bid Tuesday to halt 
aerial malathion spraying in and around that community unless the homeless are 
provided shelter. 
</P>
<P>
While applauding the ruling, state officials announced they are working with 
local government to arrange shelter for the homeless during the pesticide 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Alicemarie H. Stotler rejected a request by the Legal Aid 
Society of Orange County for a preliminary injunction that would have stopped 
the spraying unless the homeless are provided shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Legal Aid filed suit last month, contending that the aerial applications of 
malathion violated the civil rights of the homeless who live around Pioneer 
Park and caused nausea, dizziness and other ailments. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, Stotler refused to issue a temporary restraining order. At a 
second hearing Tuesday, Stotler said Legal Aid attorneys had not demonstrated 
that malathion caused the sickness suffered by those with no shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Malathion has been sprayed in an effort to combat an infestation of the 
Mediterranean fruit fly. The next spraying is set for Thursday night over a 
36-square-mile area of Garden Grove, Westminster and other Orange County 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Atty. Gen. Charles W. Getz said that though he believes the state has no 
legal obligation to shelter the homeless during spraying, officials decided to 
"go beyond our duty" and help arrange shelter for them anyway.

JUDGE SAYS HE LIED ABOUT LEAKING WIRETAP WARNINGS 
</P>

<P>
In an effort to defuse potentially damaging prosecution evidence, U.S. District 
Judge Robert Aguilar testified Tuesday that he lied when he told a lawyer that 
he had leaked information about a wiretap. 
</P>
<P>
In his second day of testimony in his own defense, Aguilar also accused a 
series of prosecution witnesses of lying or being "mistaken" in saying they had 
held conversations or meetings with him. They included a former secretary, a 
friend who was secretly cooperating with the FBI and a deputy U.S. marshal. 
</P>
<P>
The judge denied every accusation against him -- that he had tried to influence 
criminal cases by approaching fellow judges, helped his former secretary remain 
a fugitive, twice disclosed a wiretap to its target, lied to the FBI and told a 
witness to lie to a grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
He is charged with eight felonies, including a charge that he used his office 
as a "racketeering enterprise" to obstruct justice, the first such accusation 
against a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
In asserting that he had lied in the past, Aguilar was seeking to undercut the 
impact of a secretly made tape recording of a luncheon meeting in which he said 
he had relayed word to Abe Chapman, an elderly relative by marriage, that 
Chapman was being wiretapped. 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar is charged with illegally revealing the tap to Chapman twice, in 
August, 1987, and February, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1988, attorney Ed Solomon, a friend and former classmate of Aguilar, 
agreed with the FBI to wear a tape recorder to two luncheon meetings with the 
judge. On one of the tapes, Aguilar said he had relayed word to Chapman about a 
wiretap so that he would call on pay phones in the future. 
</P>
<P>
That "was not a true statement," Aguilar testified Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I was bragging to Ed Solomon . . . trying to make him feel better," the judge 
said, recalling that Solomon had appeared distraught about an FBI 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar added, "What I've said here under oath was absolutely the truth." 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar, 58, of San Jose, a judge since 1980, faces a prison sentence of up to 
55 years if convicted. He also could be removed from office by Congress 
regardless of the verdict.

TORRANCE VOTERS SIDE WITH MOBIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Torrance voters on Tuesday decisively rejected a ballot measure that would have 
forced Mobil Oil Corp. to eliminate the use of acutely hazardous hydrofluoric 
acid at its local refinery. 
</P>
<P>
The oil company, which mounted a saturation campaign to defeat Measure A, 
estimated it would have been forced to spend $100 million to convert to 
less-volatile sulfuric acid had the measure passed. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative -- which lost by a 3-1 margin -- would have prohibited the 
storage of more than 250 gallons of hydrofluoric acid at the refinery, 
effectively banning its use. Mobil, which uses the chemical in a process that 
boosts octane in unleaded gas, typically has 29,000 gallons on hand. 
</P>
<P>
Another measure, which would have allowed the city to raise its spending limit 
to pay for any lawsuit stemming from passage of Measure A, was also rejected 
handily. In addition, three City Council incumbents were easy victors over a 
lone challenger. 
</P>
<P>
Election officials said about 25% of the city's 72,000 registered voters cast 
ballots. 
</P>
<P>
The vote on Measure A was a political setback for City Councilman Dan Walker, 
who had championed it in the face of opposition from his council colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Refinery manager Wyman Robb said the vote was a clear victory for Mobil. "I 
think it's quite clear that the people of Torrance don't perceive (the 
refinery's use of hydrofluoric acid) as the big problem that people like Dan 
Walker want to make it." 
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Katy Geissert said the vote did not reflect a lack of concern over 
refinery safety. "I don't think this should be misread by Mobil Oil to mean 
that people are not concerned about the hazardous chemicals (at the refinery)," 
she said. "People are very concerned." 
</P>
<P>
Walker, asked why he thought he lost, responded: "A million dollars," a 
reference to Mobil's campaign expenditures. Nonetheless, he said, "I am very 
much surprised. There was a lot more support in the community just a matter of 
a few weeks ago." 
</P>
<P>
Polling in January by supporters indicated that sentiment strongly favored the 
measure. Last Friday, Mobil spokesman Tom Collins said company polls showed 
supporters still outnumbered opponents, although he said the gap had narrowed 
substantially. 
</P>
<P>
Walker proposed the measure last year after a series of explosions, fires and 
other accidents had caused three deaths and more than a dozen serious injuries 
at the refinery during the preceding two years. Attention was focused on 
hydrofluoric acid after a buildup of the chemical caused a massive explosion 
and fire at the refinery in November, 1987. No one was killed in that accident. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil put about $600,000 into the campaign against the measure, outspending 
supporters by 24 to 1 and dwarfing the previous city election spending record 
of $45,000, set by Walker in the 1988 City Council race. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the measure reported spending at least $25,000 and Walker also 
spent $65,000 in campaign funds to draft the measure and support the signature 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The measure has drawn the attention of lawmakers in Congress and the California 
Legislature, as well as from the South Coast Air Quality Management District, 
the oil refining industry and national environmental organizations. 
</P>
<P>
With Mobil setting records for campaign spending and airing its messages on 
major radio stations, the campaign also has attracted the interest of national 
media. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the measure cited industry-sponsored tests that showed a leak of 
1,000 gallons of hydrofluoric acid could be fatal as far as five miles 
downwind. They argued that the refinery's history of accidents showed Mobil 
could not adequately protect the public. 
</P>
<P>
Walker claimed that a defeat would cripple efforts elsewhere by legislative and 
regulatory officials to eliminate the use of hydrofluoric acid in populated 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil argued that the Torrance refinery has used thehydrofluoric acid for 40 
years without any release affecting the public, that it can safely handle any 
reasonably foreseeable leak and that switching to sulfuric acid, which is 
required in greater quantities, would create a transportation hazard. 
</P>
<P>
The company and the other six members of the seven-member City Council also 
said that Walker's primary motivation in sponsoring the measure was political. 
</P>
<P>
Walker's council opponents said they also believe that the bulk use of 
hydrofluoric acid should be eliminated at the refinery. But they said the 
measure was drawn too narrowly and that a lawsuit the city filed against Mobil 
last April offers a better vehicle for controlling all hazardous substances 
used by the company. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Janet Rae-Dupree and George Hatch contributed to this 
story.

FATAL RUNAWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Boyle Heights man was killed Tuesday when his big-rig truck rolled over him 
and careened down a steep hill in Boyle Heights. 
</P>
<P>
Zenon J. Duran, 32, had parked the truck on a steep part of City Terrace Drive 
and had placed three bricks against the left front tire as a precautionary 
measure, said California Highway Patrol spokesman Lou Gutierrez. 
</P>
<P>
Just before 8 a.m., the man started his truck and was removing the bricks when 
the truck rolled over him. 
</P>
<P>
The truck cab and its 25-foot trailer rolled for 420 feet down Wabash Street 
before jumping a curb and crashing into an apartment building. Henry Porro, who 
lived in the apartment, was taking his wife to work at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Duran was dead on arrival at County-USC Medical Center. No one else was 
injured, Gutierrez said.

BILL BOYARSKY: LOST DRAMA IN VOTING RIGHTS SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The voice on the telephone was as clear -- and as angry -- as always. 
</P>
<P>
You got it wrong, he said. You were careless. You meant to get it wrong. You've 
always had it in for me. I won that election fair and square. 
</P>
<P>
His name is Ernest Debs. From 1958 until 1974, he was a Los Angeles County 
supervisor, representing the 3rd District, which extends from East Los Angeles 
to Westwood and Bel-Air and over the Santa Monica Mountains into the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
If there is a single person who is central to the Justice Department's Voting 
Rights Act lawsuit against the county, it is this ruddy, white-haired, 
irascible man who ran his domain in the reward-your-friends, 
punish-your-enemies manner of an old political boss. 
</P>
<P>
The trial of that lawsuit is slowly ending. The Justice Department and their 
fellow plaintiffs, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Mexican American 
Legal Defense and Educational Fund, have completed their cases. Now, the county 
is presenting its side to Judge David Kenyon. But something has been missing 
through the days of tedious testimony -- the coherent unveiling of what 
actually is a great political story, a saga of old intrigues and back-room 
deals. 
</P>
<P>
It stars Ernie Debs, now in his 80s and retired. Debs dominated the Board of 
Supervisors with his cunning, his political fund-raising, his temper and his 
raw power. He sputtered in anger when he was confronted with unfriendly 
questions. Current Supervisor Pete Schabarum might be fierce in such 
situations. Debs was fearsome. 
</P>
<P>
The saga starts with Debs' long-count victory over Ed Roybal for a vacant seat 
the 1958 supervisorial election. Before that election was over, there were four 
recounts. I wrote a while back about the election, and the allegations of fraud 
that accompanied it. And Debs, in our phone conversation, thought I had been 
unfair. 
</P>
<P>
In 1958, Roybal, who is now a congressman, was a militantly liberal Los Angeles 
city councilman who criticized the downtown business establishment, and The 
Times, for promoting projects that wiped out poor Hispanic neighborhoods. 
Dodger Stadium, built in Chavez Ravine, and the Bunker Hill redevelopment 
project were two of them. Debs was a pro-development Los Angeles city 
councilman who exemplified the grow-grow-grow L.A. of the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
After the election, Debs and his four supervisorial colleagues began a series 
of boundary changes that radically altered the 3rd District and swung it in his 
favor. 
</P>
<P>
An explanatory note: After each census, supervisors, like other elected 
representatives, change the boundaries of their districts so that each district 
represents about the same number of voters. Each supervisor gets a district 
with enough potentially friendly voters to assure victory. This is called 
gerrymandering and it is customarily done in private, despite public disclosure 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
Debs and his colleagues first moved the western boundary of the 3rd District to 
include Westwood, Beverly Hills and Bel-Air. Previously, those neighborhoods 
had been in the 4th District, which runs along the coast. The next change moved 
the northwestern boundary all the way over the Santa Monica Mountains into 
Sherman Oaks, Studio City and other San Fernando Valley communities. Those 
sectors also has been in other districts. 
</P>
<P>
With each move, Debs' district became more Anglo, reducing the proportion of 
Latinos who had backed Roybal. The 3rd District, which almost elected a Latino 
in 1958, had become a constituency where Latinos had dwindled. 
</P>
<P>
Another important supervisorial decision involved the fast-growing Latino 
population in the San Gabriel Valley. These voters could gone to the 3rd 
District, which would have strengthened its Latino population. But they went to 
the neighboring 1st District. 
</P>
<P>
Thus was the Latino population divided. 
</P>
<P>
Those lines were generally followed in the supervisors' 1981 redistricting, the 
specific target of the Justice Department's lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
In the trial, neither side has has called Debs to testify. But government 
witnesses claim that his motive, and that of the other supervisors, was to 
dilute the Latino vote. In our phone conversation, Debs told me that's not 
true. The board, he said, merely reacted to population shifts. 
</P>
<P>
The rich political drama driving the case has been mummified, buried under 
highly technical testimony and boxes of fine-printed documents. This reached 
its height last week when a political science professor, vainly trying to bring 
precision to the imprecise business of politics, actually added up voter 
registration figures on his hand calculator. 
</P>
<P>
But no calculator can measure Ernie Debs' motives. Only Judge Kenyon, viewing 
it all from the bench, can do that.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 8 HOSPITALIZED AS FUMES SHUT DOWN 
COURTHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight employees were hospitalized and the Torrance courthouse closed for more 
than two hours Tuesday after a security guard trying to remove a floor stain 
mistakenly mixed chlorine and ammonia, creating hydrochloric acid fumes that 
filled the five-story building. 
</P>
<P>
The guard was trying to remove stains in a first-floor hallway of the 
courthouse on Maple Avenue at 10:30 a.m. when he poured the two cleaning agents 
into a bucket, said Chris Crawford, administrator of the South Bay Municipal 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
Several employees on the first and second floors soon reported shortness of 
breath and nausea, and the guard and seven others were taken to Little Company 
of Mary Hospital and Torrance Memorial Medical Center. All were later released.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOTEL RENOVATION ON SKID ROW COMPLETED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joined by Mayor Tom Bradley, residents of a Skid Row hotel celebrated the 
completion of a massive renovation project in a ceremony Tuesday at the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The Ward Hotel on 5th Street in downtown Los Angeles underwent more than a year 
of renovations that included installation of new electrical, heating and 
plumbing systems and the addition of new furniture, a lounge and elevators. 
</P>
<P>
The 70-unit, single-occupancy hotel houses low-income residents who pay between 
$175 and $210 monthly for the fully furnished rooms. 
</P>
<P>
It is owned by the Single Room Occupancy Housing Corp., which received funding 
from the Community Redevelopment Agency and the state Department of Housing and 
Community Development for the project. Total cost of the renovation was $1.37 
million.

TIP LEADS TO $500,000 IN STOLEN PROPERTY AND 15 ARRESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A South El Monte electrician who thought a neighboring business seemed 
suspicious led Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies to a warehouse where 
$500,000 in stolen goods was seized and 15 people were arrested, officers said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the merchandise, which ranged from refrigerators to picnic tables to 
cans of tuna, was still packaged and appeared to have been taken from the 
storerooms of several San Gabriel Valley businesses, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives are investigating the possibility that the cache may be connected to 
an interstate ring involving millions of dollars in stolen goods, but no other 
details about the operation were available, Deputy George Ducoulombier said. 
</P>
<P>
The 15 people arrested ranged in age from 21 to 45 and were in or near the 
12,000-square-foot warehouse on the 1800 block of Floradale Avenue when 
officers arrived Monday night, deputies said. They were taken to the Temple 
City sheriff's substation and booked on suspicion of receiving stolen property. 
Bail was set at $5,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Smith, 30, an electrician next door at Walton Winding Service, said he had 
long wondered what went on at the warehouse in a cinder-block building with a 
sign in the window reading "JCC Video Star." 
</P>
<P>
But Smith said he did not get concerned until he heard a big rig with two 
trailers come screeching down the dead-end street and pull up to the warehouse 
about 5 p.m. Monday. Men started throwing boxes from the trailer into parked 
cars, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It just didn't look right," said Smith, adding that he once repaired a small 
electrical tool for a man who worked at JCC Video. 
</P>
<P>
When deputies arrived, they stopped two men on the block driving what turned 
out to be a stolen tractor-trailer, Ducoulombier said. Deputies then went into 
the warehouse and discovered dozens of stacked cardboard boxes, at least some 
of which have since been claimed by a Home Club store in the City of Industry 
and a local supermarket, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies said they did not know whether the video company had any connection to 
the theft ring.

3 KILLED AS CAR SMASHES STALLED TANKER TRUCK; 
</P>

TRAFFIC: DRIVER OF DISABLED GASOLINE HAULER WAS SETTING OUT HAZARD REFLECTORS. 
FOUR PASSENGERS IN THE CAR ARE INJURED, THREE OF THEM CHILDREN.

Three people died and four others -- including three children -- suffered major 
injuries when a car smashed into the rear of a gasoline tanker truck stalled on 
the shoulder of the Golden State Freeway in Sun Valley, authorities said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The 9:45 p.m. Monday collision just north of Lankershim Boulevard clogged 
northbound traffic until 4:30 a.m. Tuesday, Officer Tami Low of the California 
Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the car, a 33-year-old man, and a passenger in the front seat, a 
30-year-old woman, died instantly when their 1990 Mazda 626 crashed into the 
disabled tanker, Low said. A 28-year-old man who had been riding in the back 
seat died about an hour later at Pacifica Hospital of the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
One of the children was seated in the front and two were in the back. All were 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
The names of the victims were not released Tuesday, pending notification of 
relatives. Low said no one in the car was wearing seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
The occupants of the car, who had been out to dinner at a Lankershim Boulevard 
restaurant, appeared to be related, Low said. The four adults in the car were 
from Los Angeles and the three children all were from El Monte, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the car drove straight into the parked truck, plowing through 
three triangular hazard reflectors and nearly hitting the truck driver, Jessie 
Jorquez, 26, of Whittier. Jorquez, who leaped out of the car's path, was 
uninjured. 
</P>
<P>
Low declined to give details on what may have caused the crash. 
</P>
<P>
She said investigators also were uncertain whether oil that had leaked from the 
truck's engine contributed to the crash. 
</P>
<P>
However, minutes before the fatal crash, Michael McNally, 20, of Sun Valley, 
lost control of his car on the oil-slick road and crashed into the center 
divider. He pulled to the side of the road to assess the damage to his car and 
assist Jorquez. 
</P>
<P>
A 3-year-old boy sitting between the two people who died in the front seat 
suffered a fractured skull and a broken leg. He was in critical condition 
Tuesday at Childrens Hospital in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
A 7-year-old boy in the back seat also was taken to Childrens Hospital. He was 
in fair condition Tuesday. A 9-year-old boy was in stable condition at Pacifica 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
A 35-year-old male passenger was taken to County-USC Medical Center but his 
condition was not released by hospital officials. 
</P>
<P>
Low said the tanker, which was hauling 8,800 gallons of gasoline to Simi 
Valley, had engine problems and pulled to the side of the freeway. Oil from the 
truck's engine leaked onto the freeway, but no fuel from the tanker escaped. 
</P>
<P>
Jorquez, who drives for Petroleum Delivery Inc. in Paramount, was setting 
hazard reflectors along the roadway when he and McNally saw the car speeding 
toward them, said Brad Johansson, president of Petroleum Delivery. 
</P>
<P>
"The car was coming straight toward us. I pushed the guy (Jorquez) out of the 
way and jumped myself," McNally said. "It just about hit us."

TOUGHER RULES REJECTED FOR ONE-CLIENT COUNTY MILK BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stronger controls for Los Angeles County's obscure Milk Commission were 
rejected by the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday, despite allegations that the 
panel is a captive of the single raw milk producer it regulates. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors voted down an ordinance that would have established standards, 
including conflict-of-interest rules, for the commission, whose sole mission is 
to oversee the production, distribution and sale of raw milk. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance was ordered drawn up last year after Chief Administrative Officer 
Richard B. Dixon complained that the six-member commission receives all of its 
funding directly from the lone company it regulates -- Stueve Brothers Farms -- 
and warned that such a relationship could compromise the panel. 
</P>
<P>
Stueve Brothers pays $3,500 a month to support the commission's activities, 
said 72-year-old Harold Steuve, whose dairy produces 8,000 to 10,000 gallons of 
raw milk a day. Most of the money paid the commission goes to testing, but the 
commission is not subject to the same fiscal controls, including review of 
expenditures by county officials, as other commissions. 
</P>
<P>
Commission members receive $25 a meeting, paid by Stueve Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, Dixon was ordered to look into the commission after a Bay Area 
judge, in an unrelated case, called the panel a "captive" of the dairy. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon questioned whether Los Angeles County should, through a quirk in the law, 
continue to regulate a dairy that is located in San Bernardino County and 
monitor raw milk that is sold statewide. But supervisors last fall rejected 
Dixon's recommendation to do away with the panel, which was created in 1968 
when raw milk dairies were located in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the board last fall ordered drafting of an ordinance establishing 
standards for operation of the commission. 
</P>
<P>
But Supervisor Pete Schabarum on Tuesday urged his colleagues to reject the 
ordinance, contending that the controversy surrounding the commission has been 
"much ado about nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Harold Steuve told the board that the new rules are part of an effort to do 
away with raw milk sales in California. "We never had any outbreak of 
anything," he said, contending that the commission has worked well to protect 
the public's health. 
</P>
<P>
Commission Chairman Dr. Paul Fleiss also disputed the need for the new rules. 
"You think that $25 a month would compromise anybody?" he asked. The state Fair 
Political Practices Commission is looking into Fleiss' work as a paid 
consultant to an attorney for the raw milk producer. Fleiss has denied any 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Schabarum in rejecting the ordinance were Supervisors Mike Antonovich 
and Deane Dana. Supervisors Ed Edelman and Kenneth Hahn were absent. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy County Counsel Steven J. Carnevale said he believes commission members 
are required to obey state conflict-of-interest laws but said the ordinance was 
designed to spell out the rules more clearly.

PRINCIPAL SAYS HE'LL ASK RESIGNATION BE RESCINDED 
</P>

Unrest continued Tuesday at two South Bay high schools as students staged a 
second day of protests against alleged racism and the resignation of a popular 
black principal. 
</P>
<P>
At Hawthorne High School, Principal Ken Crowe told about 40 students attempting 
to leave campus that he would ask the Centinela Valley Union High School 
District Board of Trustees to rescind his resignation. "I have no intention of 
going anywhere," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of about 100 police officers, Hawthorne High officials managed to 
keep all but about 50 students from leaving campus, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
At Leuzinger High School in nearby Lawndale, where a large protest began 
Monday, more than 500 students walked out of a special assembly on the issue 
Tuesday morning and took to the street, where they were met by about a dozen 
officers from several police agencies. School officials persuaded the students 
to go to the football field, where they stayed about an hour before dispersing 
for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne police said five youths and two adults carrying bricks and bottles 
were arrested near the Hawthorne campus. One youth was arrested for trespassing 
on campus and an adult was arrested after allegedly brandishing a pistol near 
the school. Officials at Leuzinger said two students were detained for 
fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's protests followed a demonstration Monday involving about 2,000 
students from the two high schools, police said. That demonstration, which 
turned violent when students began fighting and vandalizing property, erupted 
after students from Leuzinger converged on the Hawthorne campus to protest 
Crowe's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, board member Pam Sturgeon shrugged off Crowe's announcement that he 
intended to remain at his post. "He can try to get rescinded all he wants," she 
said without elaborating. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Ruth Morales and Trustees Michael Escalante, Jacqueline Carrera 
and Amparo Font could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
Crowe announced last week that he would resign at the end of the school year. 
He later said he made his decision after the board informed him he would be 
reassigned to another, unnamed position. He has also accused the board of not 
supporting his bid to rid Hawthorne High of racial harassment. 
</P>
<P>
Although board members have said they support Crowe's efforts, many protesting 
students said they believe he is being forced out because of racism. 
</P>
<P>
"Racism is happening all over the world," said Miguel Cortez, a 16-year-old 
Leuzinger student. "What can we do? Mr. Crowe got fired for being black. We 
just have to take it." 
</P>
<P>
The district has been troubled by a spate of racial incidents over the last 
five months, ranging from anonymous notes and offensive cartoons targeting 
minority administrators to the confiscation at Hawthorne High of a mannequin 
depicting a dead black man. 
</P>
<P>
District Supt. McKinley Nash has asserted that the incidents stem from 
resistance to reform in the fast-changing district, which has seen its share of 
nonwhite students soar from 45% only 10 years ago to 80% today. 
</P>
<P>
Student representatives said they were angered Tuesday afternoon when Morales 
canceled a press conference organized by Nash to answer media questions about 
the demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
District spokesman Dan Finnegan said he had not been told why Morales canceled 
the conference. Nash could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm Ratliff, a 17-year-old Leuzinger student who said he and three other 
students had been planning the demonstrations for several months, said Morales' 
decision indicates that the board is unwilling to address the students' 
concerns. Ratliff said he will urge students to continue demonstrating until 
their questions are answered. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not just fighting for the rights of black people," he said. "We want 
everyone treated fairly. This time it's blacks. Next time it could be others." 
</P>
<P>
Sturgeon later said the board would welcome talks with students. "We do want to 
hear what the kids have to say," she said.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL: COACHES AND TEAMS MAKING THEIR MARKS THIS SEASON; 
</P>
<P>
CALHOUN'S TEAM CONN.-FOUNDED ALL THE EXPERTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Jim Calhoun, his New England accent as thick as a bowl of clam chowder, never 
tires of telling how his Connecticut team defied logic and preseason 
predictions this year, to say nothing of a Big East schedule that includes such 
perennial basketball bullies as Syracuse and Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
Calhoun wants America to know that it didn't happen by accident, but by 
something as fickle and corny as teamwork. And OK, a little luck. 
</P>
<P>
It happened because Tate George, the only senior starter on the team, decided 
he wasn't going to go his entire career at Connecticut without appearing in at 
least one NCAA tournament. So during the off-season he shot 500 jumpers a day 
and later helped organize thrice-weekly workouts with his teammates that began 
at 6:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
It happened because sophomore Chris Smith, the one legitimate star on this 
team, nearly doubled his scoring average of a season ago. 
</P>
<P>
And it happened because Calhoun, who may have done the best coaching job of his 
career, also knew a thing or two about international relations, convincing 
Israel's basketball treasure, Nadav Henefeld, to venture from the Middle East 
to the Big East and, of course, to the campus at Storrs, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we're Cinderella," Calhoun said. "I think we maximize what we do 
well and hide what we don't. We have good components. The pieces fit together. 
We seem to have some answers to problems presented on the court." 
</P>
<P>
Or cawt, as Calhoun pronounces it. 
</P>
<P>
"Bet you couldn't tell I'm from Boston," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Picked by conference coaches to finish eighth, Connecticut ended the regular 
season tied for first place with Syracuse, which probably still can't believe 
it has to share a Big East title with the Huskies. And when play begins 
Thursday in the conference tournament at New York's Madison Square Garden, 
Connecticut will be there sporting all sorts of impressive numbers, including a 
25-5 record, an 11-4 Big East mark, a No. 8 national ranking and the 
testimonial of one John Thompson, Georgetown coach and closet sentimentalist. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the Hoyas' game against Connecticut at Capital Centre in 
Landover, Md., Thompson lumbered toward Calhoun. In a brief, heartfelt 
exchange, Thompson told the Connecticut coach how much he had admired the work 
done with the Huskies this season. Then, despite beating Connecticut by 20 
points that evening, Thompson delivered a postgame sermon to the media that 
once again praised Calhoun and the Huskies. 
</P>
<P>
"I think his team, in all the years I've been in the Big East, is the biggest 
surprise to me," Thompson said. "People like to run around and talk about 
surprises, but I think Calhoun has done as good a job as I've ever seen in the 
Big East -- consistently at the level he's done it at. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, everybody talked about Seton Hall being a surprise (advancing to 
the final of the NCAA tournament). I thought Seton Hall was going to be a very 
good team, and everybody misread them. I did not think Connecticut would be as 
good as they are this year. The man has done one hell of a job with that team, 
regardless of what happens from here on in." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson spoke the truth. No team in the 11-year history of the Big East has 
been picked eighth in the preseason poll and finished first. No team in the 
conference ever finished seventh one season, as the Huskies did in 1988-89, and 
went on to win or share a title the next season. In fact, no seventh-place Big 
East team had ever done better than fifth the following season until 
Connecticut arrived and changed the shape of the bell curve. 
</P>
<P>
If Calhoun is upset about the preseason snub by his peers, he doesn't show it. 
If anything, he agreed with their choices. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were picked eighth because seventh and ninth were occupied," he 
said. "It was probably a very justifiable pick." 
</P>
<P>
Consider the reasons: Cliff Robinson, the Huskies' 6-foot-11 scoring machine, 
had joined the NBA. Connecticut's leading three-point shooter was gone, too. 
Worse yet, the returning team featured no double-figure scorer and only one 
senior starter. 
</P>
<P>
"But we had a lot of guys coming back, too," George said. "People don't know 
how hard you work during the summer. They just see how you ended the season." 
</P>
<P>
For Connecticut, last season ended in the NIT, rather than in the NCAA 
tournament. An earlier two-point loss to Providence and a three-point loss to 
Seton Hall had sealed the Huskies' fate with the NCAA selection committee. 
Providence was the final Big East entry, thus extending Connecticut's record as 
being the only team in the conference's history never to appear in the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
It was shortly after this 18-13 disappointment that George started pumping 500 
shots a day. Smith went to the Olympic Festival in Oklahoma City to improve his 
game. And Calhoun flew to Tel Aviv, in hopes of signing the 6-7 1/2 Henefeld, a 
low-post player on the Israeli national team whose soft touch and court skills 
were more suited to off-guard or small forward in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Henefeld, who had visited the Connecticut campus for only four hours during a 
previous recruiting trip, eventually accepted a scholarship from the Huskies. 
But he couldn't practice with the team until his Scholastic Aptitude Test 
results were received and approved by the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
Henefeld took the test on Oct. 14. Connecticut began practice on Oct. 15. At 
3:30 p.m. on Nov. 1, Henefeld was granted permission to join the team. Later 
that night, after a brief orientation drill, Calhoun inserted Henefeld into the 
lineup against Marathon Oil, a traveling exhibition team. Afterward, Henefeld 
was asked about the experience. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very interesting, to play before you practice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Henefeld improved. He finished this season averaging 12.0 points and 5.9 
rebounds a game. He also recorded 120 steals, a total surpassed by only one 
other Division I player this season. Thus the nickname: "Gaza Strips." His 
teammates, though, unsure how to pronounce his first name (it's NAH-dove), 
started calling him, "the Dove." It stuck. 
</P>
<P>
Now there are a half-dozen interview requests for Henefeld each day -- and not 
just from the American media. As perhaps Israel's leading sports celebrity, 
Henefeld is being followed closely in that country. That would explain why at 
least one Israeli television crew will be on press row when Connecticut plays 
Seton Hall Friday at noon in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, the Huskies are used to attention, however far-flung it might be. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-nine newspaper, radio and television reporters followed Connecticut to 
Boston College last week. Against Georgetown, four local stations reported live 
from the game. Ten newspapers accompanied the Huskies to the Great Alaska 
Shootout in Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
It's no wonder Connecticut officials fondly refer to the area media as "The 
Horde." 
</P>
<P>
"People in other parts of the country might not comprehend that," said Tim 
Tolokan, Connecticut's sports information director. "But we're the No. 1 sports 
story in this state." 
</P>
<P>
Some story. The Huskies began their Big East schedule by losing their first two 
games. Then they proceeded to win 12 of their next 14 conference games. By 
season's end, Connecticut had beaten every Big East team at least once, 
including St. John's, which had drubbed the Huskies by 31 points earlier in the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"When we lost to St. John's as bad as we did, a lot of teams would have had a 
couple days off, figuring they needed time to forget about it," George said. 
"We had our regular 2 1/2-hour practice. It was like we didn't even play the 
night before." 
</P>
<P>
Said Calhoun: "We have a tremendous sense of chemistry and we're unaffected by 
outside pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe so, but they're also eighth in the conference in field-goal percentage, 
seventh in free-throw percentage, seventh in three-point percentage and sixth 
in rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
And this is the No. 8 team in the country? 
</P>
<P>
Connecticut survives despite such numbers because it averages about 17 more 
scoring opportunities a game than its opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"And you know the saying," Calhoun said, " 'Even a blind squirrel can find an 
acorn once in a while.' " 
</P>
<P>
Already there are rumors that Calhoun might be wooed away by a high-profile 
program in need of a good coach and some integrity -- did someone say North 
Carolina State? This is Calhoun's fourth year at Connecticut and he has taken 
the Huskies from a 9-19 record in 1986-87, the year he had to start a walk-on 
from the baseball team, to an NIT championship the next season, to a 25-5 
record and a soon-to-be-issued NCAA tournament bid in 1990. And at Thursday's 
news conference in New York, Calhoun is expected to receive the Big East's 
coach-of-the-year award. 
</P>
<P>
But will he stay put? 
</P>
<P>
So popular is Calhoun in Connecticut that he said he can't visit a restaurant 
and eat a meal without interruption from well-meaning fans. He has become a 
state hero, and with such stature comes a price, mainly his privacy. 
</P>
<P>
"Every single year, what I try to do is sit down and evaluate myself and my 
situation," he said. "Connecticut is a terrific job. I'm not sure the vision 
was 25-5, though. The vision was to make us a mainstream Big East team." 
</P>
<P>
That accomplished, Calhoun carefully fends off talk of his possible departure. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy here," he said. "I don't have plans to leave here. But I want to 
make sure I feel very comfortable here." 
</P>
<P>
A Big East tournament championship would help. So would a strong showing in the 
NCAA tournament, which is what George has in mind. After all, he didn't shoot 
those off-season jumpers for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"Inside the league, they respect us because we come out every night and play 
hard," George said. "But outside the league, people think we're still the new 
team on the block. Hopefully, we'll raise some hell in the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
As if they haven't done enough already.

SDSU COACH DIETZ HAS HEART TROUBLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Dietz, a self-admitted workaholic as coach/caretaker for the baseball 
program at San Diego State, was diagnosed Tuesday as having an irregular 
heartbeat, his wife said. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Dietz said more tests are scheduled for today and might help determine 
the severity of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Dietz, 51, missed Tuesday's game against the University of San Diego -- a 7-2 
Aztec victory -- and has been told by his doctor to take it easy for a while. 
</P>
<P>
Dietz had been complaining of chest pains for a couple of weeks and made an 
appointment last Thursday with his physician, Dr. Charles Inman, Carol Dietz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been after him for a long time to slow down," she said. "It's unfortunate 
it's taken something like this to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"He's already commented that he's bored to tears." 
</P>
<P>
Carol Dietz said she was surprised at the finding. "I thought they would say 
'You're under a lot of stress, you work too hard, and you don't eat right.' I 
thought they would say, 'Slow down and watch your diet.' 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently, it's a little more serious than that." 
</P>
<P>
Carol Dietz said her husband was prescribed medication and has been restricted 
to four to five hours of activity a day for the time being. That did not stop 
him from going to the office to do some paper work Tuesday night, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Dietz could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Dietz is in his 19th year at SDSU and has a 780-430-15 career mark, 14th in the 
NCAA in victories. He has built the Aztec program by often working up to 16 
hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
"As coaches, we're always doing things for someone else and sometimes neglect 
ourselves," USD Coach John Cunningham said. "I'm not sure if Jim can work 
four-hour days, but I'm sure if that's what it takes, he'll do it." 
</P>
<P>
SDSU baseball has suffered financial cutbacks in recent years because of 
athletic department deficits. Dietz was particularly worried before this season 
about the program continuing on the level it has been. 
</P>
<P>
"Jimmy doesn't sleep at night worrying how he's going to pay bills . . . The 
guy is just stressed out," said Gary Kondratek, the Aztecs' pitching coach. "He 
wants to run a legitimate Division I program, and he's just worked out." 
</P>
<P>
Said Cunningham, "He needs some help from the administration. It's about time 
someone else worried about saving the program." 
</P>
<P>
As respected as Dietz is for his baseball knowledge, he is also known for 
idiosyncrasies that include a diet seemingly built around fast food. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time we see him, he's eating McDonald's," SDSU senior outfielder Anthony 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Aztec players learned of Dietz's condition before Tuesday's game at USD's 
Cunningham Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"We were wondering where he was, because he's usually the first guy here," 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Dietz, a freshman infielder on the team, learned of his father's 
condition before leaving for USD. He was at the game but did not play. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU defeated USD in typical Dietz style. It produced seven runs on 10 hits and 
five stolen bases and got strong pitching. 
</P>
<P>
Second baseman Brian Grebeck continued his torrid hitting with a single and a 
double, three walks, three runs and a run batted in. Grebeck has now reached 
base 14 consecutive times (not counting a sacrifice fly) over the past four 
games. Kevin Nielson (3-1) worked 5 1/3 innings for the victory, striking out 
five. Rusty Filter got his third save, striking out seven of the 12 batters he 
faced, including three in a row to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Doane extended his hitting streak to nine games and lifted his average to 
.456 with a home run and two singles for USD (7-11). 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs (11-6) play host to UC San Diego today at 5 p.m. at Smith Field. 
They then travel to Nevada Las Vegas for a three-game weekend series. Kondratek 
said Dietz is not sure if he will make the trip.

MIKE DOWNEY: JUST HAVING A SHOT IS OK BY WYNALDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He still doesn't know for sure if he will get to set foot on the World Cup 
soccer fields of Italy in June, but now, more than ever, Eric Wynalda of 
Westlake Village understands what it would mean to him to be there. He has 
known it ever since he scored the United States' only goal in a game against 
Colombia on Feb. 4 at Miami, which marked his very first appearance with the 
national team. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought the national anthem could become a religious experience," said 
Wynalda, who left San Diego State to concentrate solely on soccer. "Maybe 
nobody knows what that feels like until the day you actually get to play 
something for your country." 
</P>
<P>
The United States has been booked worldwide as anywhere from a 500-1 to a 
1,000-1 longshot to win the World Cup, but Wynalda would like to be on the 
premises, just in case. Nobody thought the 1980 hockey team could win in the 
Winter Olympics, either. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, I still believe in miracles," he said. "Nobody thought Buster Douglas had 
a shot, either." 
</P>
<P>
A rather striking striker with long, blond hair, Wynalda was not among the 
Americans who saved the day on Nov. 19 by beating Trinidad and Tobago, 1-0, 
thereby qualifying for the World Cup for the first time in 40 years. He wasn't 
one of them until Coach Bob Gansler ran a tryout camp two months later in La 
Jolla, during which Wynalda impressed him enough to earn an invitation to Miami 
for the Marlboro Cup. 
</P>
<P>
The United States was having trouble scoring goals. It had gone scoreless for 
238 miserable minutes between the seventh and 10th qualifying matches of the 
World Cup, before Paul Caligiuri's memorable goal in Trinidad. It had scored 
only 11 goals in 10 games -- five of them in one contest against Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
Gansler's hair was getting grayer by the day. He was tired of scoreless ties. 
He also was irritated by certain members of the media branding him as too 
conservative a coach and saying that he played too defensive a style. There was 
nothing wrong with the U.S. team, the coach insisted, that a few well-placed 
kicks and a couple of lucky bounces couldn't cure. 
</P>
<P>
But, as Gansler later put it, once frustration sets in, after a while "the net 
starts to shrink." 
</P>
<P>
That's why he continued searching for scorers. So, when Wynalda went to La 
Jolla in early January, he found himself among 26 other gifted players, all 
auditioning after one fashion or another for Gansler. Competition for roster 
spots was stiff. And not every top player was present. Hugo Perez, the fine 
midfielder whose goal won the El Salvador game, was, for example, off playing 
in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Jobs were available, but scarce. There were guys who had played in the Major 
Indoor Soccer League, guys who had excelled on the college level, guys who had 
already demonstrated their skills for Gansler in World Cup qualifying rounds, 
all hoping to score big with the coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody there was trying to prove some point," Wynalda said. "All I could do 
was the best I could. I didn't even know until I read it in the paper that 
(Gansler) regarded me as the No. 1 striker coming out of that camp. At least, 
that's what I read. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody eventually has a sitdown with Bob Gansler, and when I had mine, I 
was on the edge of my seat. But by the time he took me to Miami, I felt that I 
had earned a chance to start. I proved to him that I can play at that level. I 
forced his hand a little to play me, or at least I hope I did." 
</P>
<P>
Wynalda responded with the team's only goal against Colombia, beating an 
offside trap and scoring from 18 yards out. Later, he assisted on the lone U.S. 
goal in a 1-0 exhibition victory over a team from Bermuda. His decision to 
devote himself to soccer was paying off. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't happy at San Diego State," Wynalda said. "It had nothing to do with 
the team there or the school itself. It was just me. It got to the point where 
I was playing and thinking soccer, and trying to get grades just to stay 
eligible. It wasn't the proper way to attend college. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd always envisioned myself as being a professional soccer player, and the 
time was right to address myself to that. Since I was 5, that's all I ever 
wanted to do. And how many chances come along to play in a World Cup?" 
</P>
<P>
Not many, for an American. Not any, since 1950. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as the team travels to Tampa, Fla., this week for a tuneup game against 
Finland, Wynalda and his sidekicks wait -- to see who gets to go to Italy. The 
coach is still looking for forwards to do more scoring. Wynalda thinks these 
are shoes he can fill.

If America is really a 1,000-1 shot, he'd like a piece of that action.

SOCKERS SATISFIED WRIGHT IS MAN FOR THE JOB; 
</P>
<P>
MISL: ZORAN KARIC'S FREQUENT RUN-INS WITH COACH RON NEWMAN, CONCERNS ABOUT 
UPCOMING CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS AND LACK OF DEFENSE SPURRED TEAM TO DEAL 
SECOND-LEADING SCORER TO CLEVELAND.

<TEXT>
<P>
At the very least, Socker Coach Ron Newman's headache is a little smaller now 
that forward Zoran Karic has been traded to the Cleveland Crunch for Paul 
Wright. 
</P>
<P>
Karic and Newman never got along. Wright and Newman do. Karic never wanted to 
play Newman's brand of soccer. Wright does. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the trade, the final wrinkles of which were ironed out Tuesday by Socker 
President Ron Cady, does beg the question of whether Wright can pull the same 
weight on the field as Karic, who departs with 36 points (22 goals, 14 
assists), second only to Branko Segota's 41. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that is why Newman's reaction is guarded. 
</P>
<P>
"Very pleased," he said. "Mixed emotions at the same time. We spent a lot of 
time on Zoran, and I've always respected his ability. But I was very 
disappointed last year when we lost Paul Wright." 
</P>
<P>
Wright, with 15 goals and 11 assists in 37 games, is not yet as dangerous 
offensively as Karic. But Wright has the capability and, perhaps more 
important, is willing to run the length of the carpet and play defense, a 
deficiency of Karic's. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers have great respect for Karic's skills, evidenced by Cady's 
insistence that the deal include a clause stating Cleveland would not trade him 
to a Western Division team before the conclusion of this season. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to make sure this was not part of a three-player trade, and he would 
end up in St. Louis or Tacoma as part of a larger deal," Socker owner Ron 
Fowler said. "That was finally worked out." 
</P>
<P>
Karic could not be reached for comment, but Cady said Karic's reaction was one 
of surprise, not bitterness. 
</P>
<P>
A factor in the trade, said Fowler, was Karic's salary. Sources say he makes 
about $50,000 and is looking next season for a significant increase, which 
would put him ahead of veterans Brian Quinn and Kevin Crow. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not about to move somebody over them," Fowler said. "We felt we weren't 
going to be able to sign Zoran for next year based upon the numbers he was 
looking for." 
</P>
<P>
Karic's repeated clashes with Newman didn't help his cause. Newman kicked him 
out of practice last week for refusing to participate in training drills and 
probably would have suspended him if the Sockers weren't desperate for healthy 
bodies. To Newman, Wright is an attractive alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so hard to know exactly what kind of performance you're going to get from 
Zoran," Newman said. "We felt we were making headway with him, then he'd come 
out and make this crazy statement that he didn't want to do any extra training. 
That irritates you. 
</P>
<P>
"With Paul, you know exactly what you're going to get." 
</P>
<P>
Wright, whose contract runs through the end of this season, appears happy with 
the trade. 
</P>
<P>
"It's wonderful to be back," Wright said in a prepared statement. "I think I've 
matured as a player here in Cleveland, and I look forward to coming back to the 
San Diego fans." 
</P>
<P>
Used exclusively as a forward in the past, Wright's role might soon change. 
Newman said he will try him at the midfield position and possibly move Segota, 
a midfielder, to forward. That would allow Segota the opportunity to take more 
shots and make use of Wright's defensive strengths. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the tactical changes, Fowler said he hopes Wright's arrival will 
provide a spark for the Sockers (16-21), currently six games out of first. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to have less conversation and more productivity," Fowler said. "I 
think this puts a number of people in the position to put up or shut up."

DOCTOR SAYS CHANG RUSHED HIS COMEBACK A BIT; 
</P>
<P>
TENNIS: THE 18-YEAR-OLD PROBABLY WILL NOT PLAY NEXT WEEK IN FLORIDA. HE MAY 
RETURN FOR APRIL 9 TOURNAMENT IN TOKYO.

The doctor who has taken over primary treatment of Michael Chang said the 
18-year-old tried to come back too soon from a hip injury when he played a 
match last week in Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
"He had gone into Memphis a bit premature, but that was a decision between the 
player and his father," said Dr. Lester Lee of Huntington Beach, a specialist 
in sports medicine and strength conditioning who has been working with Chang 
since November. 
</P>
<P>
In Chang's first match since separating a bone in his hip in December, he lost 
to Glenn Layendecker at the Volvo Tennis/Indoor tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Chang withdrew Monday from the $1-million Newsweek Champions Cup here because 
of what he described as "problems" while practicing over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Lee said he advised Chang Saturday night to pull out to avoid possible further 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
Chang said he knew something was amiss after working out Saturday and Sunday 
with his brother, Carl. "My right hip was compensating for my left hip too 
much, and it created a problem," said Chang, who refused to be more specific 
for fear his explanation would be blown out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Chang said his son became alarmed when he began to have muscle spasms in 
his right leg. 
</P>
<P>
Lee said such a symptom is consistent with what he termed "disequilibrium," 
which might also manifest itself in hamstring pulls, muscle strains or 
tendinitis. "There's nothing wrong with his left hip, that's healed," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
Lee developed a rigorous training program for Chang to strengthen muscles in 
his lower body. He said Chang probably will not play next week in the Lipton 
International Players Championship at Key Biscayne, Fla., but may return by 
April 9 for the Suntory Japan Open. Chang is designated to play the event in 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Like Stefan Edberg of Sweden, Chang received an appearance fee to play at 
Memphis, which as a World Series or lesser tour event, must pay such fees if it 
hopes to attract top players. World Series events have no top-10 players 
designated to play in them. 
</P>
<P>
Three top-10 players are designated to play in the Tokyo tournament, rather 
than six, because there are two Championship Series events scheduled the same 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Chang expects to defend his French Open title at Stade Roland Garros in Paris 
May 28-June 10. 
</P>
<P>
Lee said two trainers under his direction, Marteaan Alborn and Erich Moreno, 
will work six days a week with Chang, possibly twice a day. Ken Matsuda, who 
works with American Olympic class runners, will evaluate Chang's progress, 
according to Lee. "I've advised him we need time for the next eight months," 
Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
Chang admitted that he was somewhat confused about having to withdraw from the 
Champions Cup. His plan had been to play himself back into shape, but now he 
thinks he must first strengthen the muscles around his hip. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how long it's going to take for me to get it real strong," Chang 
said. "My body is telling me to back down a little bit. It's kind of 
frustrating . . . (because) it kind of sets me back again." 
</P>
<P>
Chang had been under the primary care of orthopedic specialist Dr. Robert 
Kerlan, but decided to make a switch. Kerlan was outspoken when he learned that 
Chang had pain before playing the match in Memphis and suggested Chang should 
not be on the court. 
</P>
<P>
However, Joe Chang said Lee's role became more important because Chang's home 
in Placentia is closer to Lee's office than it is to the Kerlan-Jobe Clinic in 
Inglewood. Lee said he believes that Chang should recover fully if he follows 
the training program.

The Miami Hurricanes are considering a move from independent status to the 
Atlantic 10 Conference in basketball, which would take effect when Penn State 
joins the Big Ten, a Miami official said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had some discussions with the Atlantic 10," Miami Associate Athletic 
Director Larry Wahl said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's about where it is right now -- discussions. We're looking at anything 
that makes sense, whether it's an all-sports conference, or whether it will be 
to remain independent in football." 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, West Virginia and other Eastern football independents have 
talked about forming an all-sports conference. Those talks took on greater 
urgency after Penn State announced that it was leaving the Atlantic 10 for the 
Big Ten, a move that will be complete in all sports by the mid-1990s.

NEWSWIRE: STEVE HOWE CAN RETURN TO MAJORS IN 1991 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Howe, the former Dodger pitcher who has been suspended six times for drug 
and alcohol problems, will be allowed to return to the major leagues starting 
in 1991, Commissioner Fay Vincent said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Howe, released by the Texas Rangers on Jan. 19, 1988, for using alcohol in 
violation of his aftercare program, can return to the minor leagues this 
season, Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
Howe, who will be 32 Saturday, was the National League's rookie of the year in 
1980, but was released by the Dodgers, Minnesota and Texas because of his 
problems. He was suspended for the 1984 season by Commissioner Bowie Kuhn for 
cocaine use. 
</P>
<P>
"While I believe a lifetime ban is fully warranted in this case, I resolve the 
doubts raised by the conflicting medical and psychological problems in Howe's 
favor and will offer him yet another chance to return to the game," Vincent 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent added that Howe would be removed from the game if he tests positive, or 
has a relapse. He will be tested as often as every other day. 
</P>
<P>
Howe spoke to Vincent on Feb. 8. Howe has a 29-31 career record with 60 saves 
in his seven major league seasons.

WOODEN SAYS GATHERS WILL REMAIN ON BALLOT FOR PLAYER-OF-THE-YEAR VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hank Gathers, who died Sunday of undetermined causes, and his Loyola Marymount 
teammate, Bo Kimble, were among 14 finalists named Tuesday for the John Wooden 
basketball player-of-the-year award and All-American team. 
</P>
<P>
The other finalists: Georgia Tech's Kenny Anderson and Dennis Scott; Nevada Las 
Vegas' Stacey Augmon and Larry Johnson; Syracuse's Derrick Coleman; Illinois' 
Kendall Gill; LSU's Chris Jackson; Georgetown's Alonzo Mourning; Oregon State's 
Gary Payton; Michigan's Rumeal Robinson; La Salle's Lionel Simmons, and 
Michigan State's Steve Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing on the Turner Network, Wooden said of Gathers: "We sincerely regret 
the tragedy of his death during the basketball game Sunday evening. Hank had 
been certified by his university as a model student-athlete and team leader. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a second-team All-American last year and our national advisory board, 
because of his outstanding play during the entire season, selected him again to 
be on our national ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"We wish him to stay on this ballot of the 14 outstanding players in the 
nation. This ballot goes to the 1,000 voters who are sportswriters and 
sportscasters throughout the nation who will select this year's All-American 
team and the player of the year." 
</P>
<P>
The winners will be announced on April 1 in Denver, site of the NCAA Final 
Four.

MOUNTAIN CLIMBING: AMERICANS, SOVIETS, CHINESE WILL ATTEMPT TO CELEBRATE EARTH 
DAY ATOP MT. EVEREST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
When Jim Whittaker became the first American to stand at the highest point on 
Earth 27 years ago, he still couldn't see 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Whittaker has been called back to the mountain the Tibetans call 
Qomolangma -- "goddess mother of the world." 
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, on April 22, the 20th anniversary of Earth Day, the Mt. 
Everest Earth Day 20 International Peace Climb will place an American, a Soviet 
and a Chinese on the 29,028-foot summit, and each will make a statement on live 
television. 
</P>
<P>
Whittaker and fellow mountaineers Warren Thompson and Bud Krogh first discussed 
the climb in 1981 during a White House reception recognizing their feat of 
leading a group of handicapped climbers -- some blind -- up Mt. Rainier. 
Looking for another "socially redeeming cause," Whittaker said, they hit upon 
the idea of an international attempt at Everest. 
</P>
<P>
"We narrowed it down to the Soviets and Chinese and Americans," he added. "We 
figured, 'Let's take our enemies and rope up so our lives are depending on one 
another. We'll go to the top and stand there demonstrating to the world that 
through friendship and cooperation high goals can be reached, (such as) world 
peace.' " 
</P>
<P>
But here's the deal: All three have to make it or nobody will. 
</P>
<P>
"When the people signed on, I said, 'Is it clear that you can't go to the 
summit alone, that you'll have to go with two other people?' " Whittaker said 
from his home in Port Townsend, Wash. "That was tough for a couple of them. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to get all three up to show that we have to depend on each other in 
this world. Our lives depend on each other. If, say, the Chinese guy doesn't 
make it up on the mountain, then we don't, either, and the same holds true down 
here. We've got to all make it together or nobody's going to make it. 
</P>
<P>
"If somebody poops out on that first rope, they're going to either drag them 
the last few hundred feet to the summit and prop them up between 'em, because 
they want the summit, or they're going to have to turn around, and the next 
rope of three will go for the summit." 
</P>
<P>
There will be five teams of three climbers each. The expedition, traveling 
through China and Tibet, was scheduled to arrive today at Base Camp near the 
Main Rongbuk Glacier, from where they will assault the traditional North Col 
route. 
</P>
<P>
Up to now, they have ridden in trucks; from now on, they will walk and climb. 
But Whittaker would not complain. When he climbed Everest from the other side 
in 1963, he had to walk 185 miles first. 
</P>
<P>
"We're driving to the base of the mountain at 17,100 feet, which is what our 
base camp was on the other side," he said. "It's fantastic. We drive to the 
base and dump out our stuff -- 10 tons of food and 10 tons of equipment." 
</P>
<P>
That's meant to sustain 50 people for up to three months. At times the 
logistics were more difficult than the climb is expected to be. 
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese said, 'We haven't had Soviets in our country for 30 years,' " 
Whittaker said. "I said, 'Yeah, but you came to our country with Ping-Pong 
balls. We'd like to come with the Soviets with ice axes and crampons.' 
</P>
<P>
"Then they said, 'Well, that's not a bad idea, but we don't want to invite them 
unless we're sure they'll come.' So then I went to the Soviet Union, and they 
said, 'We'd like to go, but we don't want to invite ourselves.' 
</P>
<P>
"Then the Chinese said, 'You can bring your Soviet friends, but we don't think 
we should participate because we don't think we're good enough climbers.' I 
said, 'Well, all we need is people that are in good shape. We'll get them up to 
technique -- and we won't go to the summit without a Chinese on the rope.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese were scheduled to fly to Washington for the first training sessions 
on Mt. Rainier early last summer, when the bloody demonstrations in Tian An Men 
Square broke out. The team got through, but the project's $1.1-million budget 
suffered somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
"Our fund-raising from corporations slowed down," Whittaker said. "Some 
companies said, 'We don't touch that one because of the Chinese.' This is even 
more important now." 
</P>
<P>
Others stood fast -- most notably, L.L. Bean, the principal sponsor, and 
Boeing, Seattle's largest employer, which had never sponsored a mountaineering 
expedition despite the city's tradition in the sport. Leon Gorman, grandson of 
L.L. Bean, founder of the the Maine-based outdoor clothing and equipment 
catalog company, is a team member but doesn't plan to go past Camp Two at 
21,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
A major thrust of the project is environmental -- to "clean the world from the 
top down," Whittaker said. 
</P>
<P>
He added: "We're going to clean all the garbage off the mountain that's been 
left there by previous expeditions, including mine. We figure there's a couple 
of tons of it up there -- oxygen bottles and tents and old stuff. We'll load it 
on the yaks at Camp Three, and the Chinese have located depressions where we 
can have landfills." 
</P>
<P>
Himalayan climbers started noticing a severe litter problem several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"When I had the Chinese and Soviets up on Rainier for the shakedown, we even 
carried out our human waste," Whittaker said. "The Soviets and Chinese couldn't 
believe it. They said the difference between us was the Americans throw 
wrappers and stuff into the tents, and the Soviets and Chinese throw it out of 
the tents. So we've got 'em thinking about that, too." 
</P>
<P>
Future expeditions will be required to post bonds against bringing out their 
trash. That includes everything from food packages to cigarette butts. 
</P>
<P>
Tibetans will help with the climb, Whittaker said, "and they smoke like 
furnaces. So you've got to lay down the law and have them all smoke outside the 
tent. 
</P>
<P>
"The food is a little different. The Tibetans like food that they're used to. 
The Soviets will eat our food, but we have a varied menu so everybody will feel 
like they're getting what they need." 
</P>
<P>
The food will be better fare than the average mountaineering expedition enjoys 
-- not freeze-dried, but fully constituted or repacked. The latter weighs more, 
Whittaker said, but water is needed to prepare a freeze-dried meal, and fuel is 
needed to melt ice or snow, "so you have to carry the fuel, so we're saying, 
let's carry the repack." 
</P>
<P>
Whittaker's most difficult moment may be when it is time to select one of the 
five American climbers for the international all-star team that will make the 
first assault on the summit. He is almost certain he won't pick himself. 
</P>
<P>
"As we go along, we'll be seeing how they climb and how strong they are, and 
toward the final assault I'll pick who I think is the strongest American and 
deserves the summit the most . . . worked hardest for the good of the 
expedition. The Soviet and Chinese leaders will do the same." 
</P>
<P>
The final ascent will cover about 1,200 vertical feet in an area of Everest 
mystique. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll be going up the route that (British climbers George Leigh) Mallory and 
Andrew Irvine disappeared on in 1924," Whittaker said. "They disappeared into 
the clouds, wearing oxygen, never to be seen again." 
</P>
<P>
There is still speculation that Mallory and Irvine were the first to reach the 
summit, long before New Zealand's Sir Edmund Hillary and the Sherpa, Tenzing 
Norgay, in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
"When I climbed Everest, everybody said I 'conquered' the mountain. There's no 
way I conquered that mountain. I was lucky as hell to get up and down alive. 
And most climbers will say that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

FREE THROWS LEAD WAY FOR FAITH BAPTIST, 67-52 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Faith Baptist High basketball Coach Stuart Mason did not need to philosophize 
Tuesday night on how his team defeated Calipatria, 67-52, in the opening round 
of the Division V Southern California regional tournament. 
</P>
<P>
He knew, as did most observers, that simple arithmetic at the free-throw line 
told the whole story. 
</P>
<P>
Faith Baptist converted 23 of 31 free throws, while its opponent was zero of 
seven. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some players who were feeling a little sick tonight," Mason said. "We 
just tried to capitalize on anything they gave us. Our kids played their hearts 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Surprising Faith Baptist (20-10), which defeated Brethren, 65-59, in overtime 
Friday night to win the Southern Section 1-A championship, will play at Ribet 
Academy at 7:30 p.m. Thursday in the semifinals. Calipatria, the San Diego 
Section Division V runner-up, finished the season 21-5. 
</P>
<P>
Calipatria was smaller and slower than Faith Baptist, yet the Hornets stayed 
close for much of the game. In fact, they pulled ahead of the Contenders, 
40-38, early in the fourth quarter on forward Javier Vega's layup. 
</P>
<P>
Faith Baptist responded with a three-point bomb from sophomore guard Darren 
Wyre and never trailed again. 
</P>
<P>
With the Contenders' normal scoring leaders -- sophomores Alex Estrada and 
Peter Rasmussen -- slowed by the flu, Wyre increased his average by making four 
three-points shots in the second half on his way to a game-high 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
Estrada, a 5-foot-8 guard, finished with 13 points, and Rasmussen, a 6-foot-6 
center, added 15. Junior forward Fernando Garcia had 12.

HOME COURT PROVES NO ADVANTAGE FOR HART IN LOPSIDED LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The girls' basketball team from Mt. Carmel High in San Diego journeyed more 
than 2 1/2 hours Tuesday to play Hart, which had not lost a home game in more 
than two years. 
</P>
<P>
So what happened? Mt. Carmel ran the Indians right out of their own gym -- and 
the state playoff tournament -- with a 65-42 victory in a Southern California 
Division I regional. 
</P>
<P>
So much for home-court advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little stunning," said Hart Coach Dave Munroe, whose team won the 
Southern Section 5-A Division championship Friday with a 49-45 victory over 
Buena. "We're better than what we played tonight. We were flat." 
</P>
<P>
Flattened is more accurate. This one got ugly fast and stayed that way. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Carmel (23-5), the San Diego Section Division I champion, led 19-9 after 
one quarter, 40-13 by halftime and 55-24 midway through the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
From there it was all substitutions and dribbling. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never had a 40-point half all year long," Mt Carmel Coach Peggy Brose 
said. "Maybe we should take a 2 1/2-hour bus trip before every game." 
</P>
<P>
The Sundevils kept Hart (25-5) bottled up, especially in containing 6-foot-3 
senior center Sara Wilson, who scored just nine points. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, last season's Times Valley Player of the Year, did not score until she 
sank a free throw midway through the third quarter and did not make a field 
goal until the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore point guard Anjanette Dionne, the other half of Hart's one-two punch, 
poured in a game-high 19 points -- including three three-point baskets -- but 
she also was largely neutralized. 
</P>
<P>
Hart's highlight of the evening came with 2 minutes 47 seconds to play when 
Dionne, after fouling out, received a standing ovation for her season-long 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have the intensity tonight," said Dionne, who averaged 23 points a 
game this season. "I'm glad to see that everyone stayed until the end instead 
of leaving." 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Carmel moved the ball swiftly, mostly to 5-8 junior forward Vicki de Jesus, 
who scored a team-high 17 points. Kris Grazzini, a 6-2 sophomore center, added 
16 points. 
</P>
<P>
Guards Tara Schwerin (13) and Rachel Velasco (12) also scored in double 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just a team that has no superstars but just plays well," Brose said. 
"Our shots were falling." 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Carmel made 27 of 53 (51%) from the field while Hart was 18 of 55 (32%). 
</P>
<P>
"We dug a hole," Munroe said simply. "But we played 30 games this year, we're 
allowed to make a mistake."

The Raiders signed Plan B free-agent linebacker Joe Campbell of the San Diego 
Chargers, according to Campbell's agent, Mike Merkow. 
</P>
<P>
Merkow said Campbell signed two one-year contracts with the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, 6 feet 3 1/2 and 242 pounds, was a fourth-round draft choice from New

PEREZ HOPES TO BE READY TO REJOIN U.S. SOCCER TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hugo Perez, who suffered a broken bone above his right ankle in a soccer match 
Saturday, is optimistic that he will be able to play for the United States in 
the World Cup finals in June. Perez, who has been injury-prone in the past, is 
regarded as one of the most talented players on the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
He was injured while playing for Red Star of Paris, a French second division 
team, in a match at Gueugnon, France. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be in a cast for three to four weeks," Perez said from Paris, "and then I 
want to do my rehabilitation in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"If the (U.S. Soccer Federation) agrees to to take me back, I'll be ready for 
the World Cup." 
</P>
<P>
Perez estimated that he would be ready to play by May, when the United States 
has some preliminary games leading up to the World Cup competition. 
</P>
<P>
John Polis, a spokesman for the U.S. Soccer Federation, said it was too early 
to comment on Perez's status. 
</P>
<P>
The El Salvador-born Perez, a naturalized U.S. citizen, appeared in only two of 
10 qualifying games dating to 1988 because of injuries, according to Polis. 
</P>
<P>
Perez suffered from stress fractures in both shins and had a groin injury. 
However, he scored the winning goal in a 1-0 qualifying-round victory over 
Honduras on Sept. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Perez, 26, said he would feel more comfortable with his rehabilitation program 
in the United States, which, he said, has better facilities. He is also 
concerned that doctors in Paris might want to keep him in a cast longer because 
of ligament damage that he says can be repaired without a cast. 
</P>
<P>
"A doctor told me that I was fortunate it was a straight break and not 
shattered in two pieces," Perez said. "It's just a crack. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to help the (U.S.) team. The main thing is not to be embarrassed 
in the World Cup." 
</P>
<P>
The United States has qualified for the World Cup for the first time in 40 
years.

EL CAMINO GETS A WINNING TIP FROM ITS COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With two seconds left, their team down two points and the length of the court 
to go Tuesday night, El Camino's Travis Gilley and Dee Boyer figured this was 
no time for one of their coach's crazy plays. 
</P>
<P>
But Gilley, Boyer and the rest of 2,000 people jammed inside El Camino's gym 
soon became believers in Coach Ray Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino's Shaun Scurry heaved the ball to heavily guarded Boyer at the top of 
the key, and Boyer tipped it to Gilley for an 18-foot jumper that barely hit 
the back of the rim and fell in to make it 73-73. 
</P>
<P>
From there, there was no stopping El Camino. The Wildcats blew away from 
Compton in the three-minute overtime, scoring 19 points to win the quarterfinal 
round of the Division II Southern California Regionals, 92-78. 
</P>
<P>
"We figured our miracle happened, now let's go and win the game," Gilley said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to making the game-tying shot, Gilley scored seven of El Camino's 
19 points in overtime to finish with a team-high 29. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino (23-6), seeded fourth, will now play at No. 1 Artesia Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
The play that enabled El Camino to live another day was an old favorite of 
Johnson's. 
</P>
<P>
"I used that play when I was at Oceanside," he said. "We won a game with it 
there too. It's a sucker play, everybody rushes to the ball. It's a natural 
reaction." 
</P>
<P>
Boyer, who finished with eight points, 14 rebounds and six blocks, said, "It 
didn't seem like two seconds was enough, but then I realized the clock doesn't 
start until the ball hits my hands." 
</P>
<P>
El Camino led at the end of the first quarter, 19-15, but trailed at halftime, 
37-31, and throughout most of the game. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Wildcats were down, 65-58, with 5:30 left in regulation before 
they scored six consecutive points to close to 65-64 with 3:22 left. 
</P>
<P>
Compton (22-8) took a 71-67 lead with 1:50 left, but Scurry hit a 15-foot 
jumper and Gilley sank two free throws to tie it a 71 with 1:05 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Boyer had an opportunity to put El Camino ahead with 12 seconds left, but he 
missed two free throws. Compton's Derick Florence then came down and hit a 
16-foot jumper to give his team a 73-71 lead with two seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted the last shot," Compton Coach Curtis Knight said. "We didn't want to 
shoot so early." DAVE McKIBBEN

In another Division II game: 
</P>
<P>
Glendora 51, University City 45 -- Only five players scored for host Glendora, 
but three of them reached double figures. Adam Jacobsen had 18 points, 
including three three-pointers, and J.J. Olaughlin had 15 for second-seeded 
Glendora (27-5). Ray Hooper had 12 points and and Jerome Price added 10 for 
University City (24-5), the seventh seed. 
</P>
<P>
Glendora led, 28-21, at halftime. University City, the San Diego Section 
Division II runner-up, rallied to outscore Glendora, 13-8 in the third quarter 
and pull within, 36-34. 
</P>
<P>
DIVISION III 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar 67, Lincoln 65 -- A desperation shot by Andre Toussaint that 
traveled three-quarters the length of the court, banked off the backboard and 
then bounced off the back of the rim as time expired and Corona del Mar scored 
an upset over the No. 2 seed. 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Garner scored 23 for Lincoln (22-9), but Corona del Mar's one-man show 
was more potent. John Paulsen scored 30 for the Sea Kings (20-10), including 
his team's first 14 points in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The loss snapped a 13-game winning streak for the Hornets, who also got 14 from 
Darryl McMillan and 12 from Andre Toussaint. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln has lost eight of nine games this year in which it failed to score at 
least 70 points and Coach Ron Loneski lamented after this one that the Hornets 
couldn't entice Corona del Mar to run with them. 
</P>
<P>
DIVISION IV 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach 71, Coronado 37 -- Laguna Beach scored 21 consecutive points in 
the third quarter on the way to the rout and Mission Bay High. Coronado (19-9) 
stayed close and was tied, 23-23, at halftime behind six blocks by center Derek 
Wastila. 
</P>
<P>
But Wastila picked up his third and fourth fouls midway through the third 
quarter and Coronado lost its momentum. The teams were tied, 25-25, before 
Laguna Beach (23-6) scored the 21 points in a row. 
</P>
<P>
John Trevino had 19 points for Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
DIVISION V 
</P>
<P>
Christian 74, St. Margaret's 52 -- Tony Clark equaled St. Margaret's total 
offensive output with 52 points as Christian won easily at home. Christian, the 
second seed, led, 34-21, at halftime and outscored San Juan Capistrano St. 
Margaret's in every quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Canoga Park Faith Baptist 67, Calipatria 52 -- Faith Baptist made 23 of 31 free 
throws and Calipatria was zero for seven at the line. Darren Wyre scored 21 
points for Faith Baptist (20-10).

The Chargers lost their second player to Plan B free-agency Tuesday when the 
Raiders signed linebacker Joe Campbell, according to Campbell's agent, Mike 
Merkow. 
</P>
<P>
Merkow said Campbell signed two one-year contracts with the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>

STUDENTS HOLD PROTEST FOR SECOND DAY; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOLS: NO VIOLENCE REPORTED AS UNREST CONTINUES OVER A PRINCIPAL'S 
RESIGNATION IN RACIALLY TENSE CENTINELA VALLEY DISTRICT.

High school students upset about administrative changes in a South Bay-area 
district they attribute to racism staged a second day of protests Tuesday, some 
walking off campus and joining sympathizers at another school, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's protests began about 9 a.m. at Hawthorne High School, where a popular 
black principal recently announced that he will resign, saying he was under 
pressure from the Board of Trustees of the racially tense Centinela Valley 
Union High School District. 
</P>
<P>
The protest ended shortly before noon at Leuzinger High School, about a mile 
away in Lawndale, where a student walkout on Monday erupted in sporadic fights, 
vandalism and thefts. 
</P>
<P>
Nine students were detained Tuesday for truancy and one adult was arrested on 
suspicion of trespassing on campus, police said. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
Five students were detained Monday. One youth was held after he allegedly threw 
a piece of concrete at a school bus and the others were released to their 
parents, Hawthorne Police Sgt. Mike Effler said. 
</P>
<P>
Police, nearly overwhelmed Monday by at least 2,000 unruly student marchers who 
stopped traffic on six-lane Rosecrans Avenue, were ready Tuesday when students 
gathered outside Hawthorne High in preparation for an announced walkout, Effler 
said. At least 70 officers were called in from half a dozen neighboring 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"We basically decided, after talking with school officials, to keep them on 
campus today," Effler said Tuesday. "Through a bullhorn, I told them that the 
place for their forum was on campus, not the streets. They didn't like it very 
much. But most turned back." 
</P>
<P>
As the time for the walkout approached, however, about 100 students began 
"testing our perimeters," Effler said. "Some managed to break past us and into 
the residential neighborhood. They were tracked to Leuzinger." 
</P>
<P>
At Leuzinger, the Hawthorne students were met by several hundred others, said 
Joe Finnegan, a district spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"The Leuzinger administrators tried to have assemblies to discuss the students' 
concerns," Finnegan said. "The sophomore assembly went fine, but the juniors 
for some reason went out the door. We don't know exactly what triggered it." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies and other law officers managed to round 
up the unruly group, keeping them on campus where about 500 Leuzinger students 
and their Hawthorne compatriots held a rally before the event broke up and most 
students returned to classes, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Schools Supt. McKinley Nash had scheduled a Tuesday afternoon news conference 
with student and school representatives to discuss the issues plaguing the 
6,000-student district. But Finnegan announced later that the 1:30 p.m. 
briefing at district headquarters had been called off on the orders of School 
Board President Ruth Morales. 
</P>
<P>
Finnegan said "the school board has requested investigations by the NAACP, the 
state Civil Rights Commission and other civil rights groups, to come in and 
look at our district, go through the charges and make findings." 
</P>
<P>
The board, he said, is "very interested in getting all of these (allegations of 
racism) cleared up or remedied." 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne Principal Ken Crowe announced last Wednesday that he would resign at 
the end of the year because board members had told him that he will be 
reassigned to another, unnamed position. 
</P>
<P>
Crowe has told The Times that he does not want to leave the school and he 
believes that the board's move to reassign him is a "political payoff" for a 
white teacher who supported the elections of three new board members last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Crowe told reporters Tuesday that he would not remain silent about his 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what the feeling of the board is. I have not had any 
communication with the board. I do know that I will request a meeting with the 
board, and I will ask them to rescind my resignation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Board members have declined to comment on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
As the school day wound to a close Tuesday, some students were vowing to 
continue the walkouts until their grievances are heard by the board.

GLOBAL INDUSTRY: EXECUTIVES OF THE JAPANESE AND WEST GERMAN CONGLOMERATES AGREE 
TO FORM AN ALLIANCE. THE MOVE WOULD GIVE THEM BOTH AN EDGE IN WORLD BUSINESS.

In an apparent strategy to gain access to the united European Economic 
Community market after 1992, Japan's largest industrial group announced Tuesday 
that it was negotiating with its West German counterpart to expand cooperation 
in electronics, aerospace and a range of other fields. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Corp., the core company of the giant Mitsubishi conglomerate, said 
its top executives had met last weekend in Singapore with executives of the 
Daimler-Benz group and agreed to strengthen business ties between the two 
groups, which already cooperate in the automotive sector. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi said in a statement that increased cooperation would be pursued in 
"high-growth industries" that would "benefit from development on a global scale 
and make effective use of the skills of both groups." 
</P>
<P>
Although details of the proposed business alliance were not spelled out, the 
move can be expected to give both groups a stronger edge in international 
competition in the years to come. 
</P>
<P>
Daimler-Benz, which includes the auto manufacturer Mercedes-Benz, would gain 
access to Japanese high technology, and companies in the Mitsubishi group would 
enjoy marketing channels in post-1992 Europe, where the Japanese fear the rise 
of trade protectionism. 
</P>
<P>
"The concrete details are yet to be worked out," Yoshio Taniguchi, executive 
vice president of Mitsubishi Corp., told the Asahi newspaper. "In any event, we 
have made a cooperative relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Shinroku Morohashi, president of Mitsubishi Corp., the general trading firm 
that coordinates the activities of the 41 companies in the Mitsubishi group, 
led the delegation to Singapore last weekend. He was joined by the heads of 
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Mitsubishi Motors and Mitsubishi Electric. 
</P>
<P>
From the West German side, Daimler-Benz Chairman Edzard Reuter led 
representatives from the electronics giant AEG, Deutsche Aerospace and 
Daimler-Benz Inter Services, the group's trading company. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a far-reaching exchange of ideas about ways to expand the 
relationship beyond the automotive sector, where Mercedes Benz and Mitsubishi 
Motors Corp. have enjoyed close ties," Mitsubishi's statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The top executives will continue to hold talks periodically, with the next 
meeting set for 1991, Mitsubishi said. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Motors currently sells Mercedes-Benzes in Japan through its domestic 
distribution network. 
</P>
<P>
The Mitsubishi Group, with combined annual revenues of close to $200 billion, 
is descended from a zaibatsu, a prewar industrial and financial conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
Companies in the group have recently attracted attention in the United States 
for aggressive business activities: 
</P>
<P>
* Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the leader in Japan's defense industry, is the 
main contractor on the controversial FSX fighter development project, which has 
become the symbol of "techno-nationalism" friction between Japan and the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
* Mitsubishi Estate raised hackles at the end of October by purchasing a 51% 
stake in New York's Rockefeller Center, a conspicuous landmark property that 
symbolized Japan's surge in investment in U.S. real estate. 
</P>
<P>
* Mitsubishi Corp. announced in January it would finance an $850-million 
leveraged buyout of Pittsburgh-based Aristech Chemical Corp. in an apparent bid 
to gain inroads into the American petrochemical market. 
</P>
<P>
Taniguchi, Mitsubishi Corp.'s vice president, said at the news conference 
Tuesday that the tie-up should not be perceived as threatening to the United 
States since nothing concrete had been decided yet. 
</P>
<P>
Taniguchi reportedly said, "It is inconceivable that this would aggravate the 
American side, and we have no intention whatsoever to aggravate the American 
side." 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi officials said the areas of cooperation with Daimler-Benz would 
exclude activities in the defense industry, according to Japanese press 
reports.

U.S. Carriers on Time More Often: Major U.S. airlines improved in the number of 
on-time flights and received fewer baggage-handling complaints in January, the 
government reported. 
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Department, in its monthly Air Travel Consumer Report, said 
the largest domestic carriers reported that 77.6% of their flights were on time 
during the month, compared to 70.2% in December. Southwest Airlines had the 
best on-time record for the month, with 82.5%. Eastern had the worst, with 
70.7%.

Foreign Firms Get More of Japan Chip Market: Increased cooperation between 
Japanese and U.S. firms helped foreign companies boost their share of Japan's 
semiconductor market to a record 12.9% in the fourth quarter of 1989, 0.9 
percentage points above the previous quarter and 2.3 points higher than the 
year-ago quarter, a Ministry of Trade and Industry official said. However, the 
MITI official declined to predict whether foreign firms would achieve by 1991 
the 20% share they had targeted after signing the Japan-U.S. semiconductor pact 
in 1986.

Diaper Deals for Dandees Enterprises: The 3-year-old Los Angeles firm announced 
commitments from 750 Southern California markets, including Hughes, Boys and 
Ralphs, to carry its new line of diapers. The deals came despite mounting 
criticism from environmentalists and such companies as Procter &amp; Gamble, 
who contend that so-called degradable diapers don't truly degrade in landfills. 
The diapers, like other degradable plastics on the market, are 94% 
petroleum-based plastic and 6% starch and enzymes.

COURT RULING FAILS TO MELT DOUBLE RAINBOW'S RESOLVE 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
For five years now, pint-size Double Rainbow, a popular San Francisco ice cream 
maker, has portrayed its legal bout with Haagen-Dazs as a classic David vs. 
Goliath struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, Double Rainbow has been battling to get before a jury to plead its 
case that Haagen-Dazs has hogged the lucrative market for ultra-rich ice creams 
by preventing its smaller rival from getting into grocery store freezers. 
</P>
<P>
Double Rainbow contends that Haagen-Dazs, a former Pillsbury unit now owned by 
a British conglomerate, has violated antitrust laws by unfairly preventing 
independent distributors from carrying competing brands. The practice, Double 
Rainbow said, has thwarted its own efforts to launch a nationwide push. 
</P>
<P>
But so far Double Rainbow has been getting licked in the courts. Last month, it 
lost another key round when a three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court 
of Appeals upheld a lower court's ruling that Haagen-Dazs could indeed demand 
the loyalty of distributors. 
</P>
<P>
Now the entrepreneurial "David" is using an unusual strategy -- aiming its 
slingshot at the very justices whom it is trying to persuade to rehear the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
"An insult to the taste buds of America" is how Steven H. Fink, co-founder and 
co-owner of Double Rainbow Gourmet Ice Creams, describes the justices' 
determination that all ice creams are basically alike and that Haagen-Dazs, 
with 2% of the $9.5-billion overall market, therefore does not have a monopoly. 
Fink has argued that luxury ice creams, of which Haagen-Dazs is the clear 
leader, form a market of their own apart from economy brands. 
</P>
<P>
His lawyer went even further, impugning the justices' grasp of the law. In 
documents filed last month, he said that they goofed in siding with Haagen-Dazs 
because they were "confused by" and "ignored" legal precedents. 
</P>
<P>
So how will this go over? 
</P>
<P>
"They'll probably get mad at me," said John H. Boone, the attorney. If the 
appeals court refuses to rehear the case, Boone said, he will take it to the 
U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, Haagen-Dazs, based in Teaneck, N.J., maintains that Double 
Rainbow simply has a weak case. 
</P>
<P>
"They've cried wolf all along, but the facts just aren't there," said William 
C. Miller, a Haagen-Dazs attorney in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The case, Fink said, demonstrates how tough life can be for the little guy in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, it's not a battle of the best but of the most powerful," Fink said. 
</P>
<P>
In his view, the controversy has forced him and his partner, Michael P. Sachar, 
to scale back their dreams of a pot of gold. 
</P>
<P>
The two men from Brooklyn -- who as childhood pals sold ice cream at Coney 
Island and concocted their own in the Fink family kitchen -- opened their first 
ice cream store on San Francisco's Castro Street in February, 1977, naming it 
for the double rainbow that Fink had seen the day they signed the lease. 
</P>
<P>
In the 200-square-foot store, they sold Haagen-Dazs ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
As their second location was going up, they were visited one day by Doris 
Mattus, daughter of Haagen-Dazs founder Reuben Mattus. According to Fink, she 
demanded that they shut down the stores or become Haagen-Dazs franchisees. 
</P>
<P>
When Fink and Sachar refused, Haagen-Dazs, at the time owned by Pillsbury, 
threatened to stop shipping to them. (Grand Metropolitan PLC, a British food 
and drink conglomerate, bought Haagen-Dazs along with the rest of Pillsbury in 
late 1988.) 
</P>
<P>
As Fink tells it, the Double Rainbow team sued to win a nine-month reprieve. 
During that time, the two developed a luxury ice cream and sold it in their 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
Double Rainbow quickly became a favorite of Bay Area ice cream lovers and began 
garnering a national reputation. In 1982, the company's vanilla took top honors 
at the Great American Lick-Off in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
In a former burrito factory on South Van Ness, the company now makes 40 flavors 
for 32 franchise stores (including six in Southern California) and three 
company-owned stores. In addition, it sells to 150 restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
But it's a different story when it comes to supermarket sales, where contenders 
in the super-premium ice cream category have waged a heated battle for freezer 
space. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas Fink and Sachar once envisioned that their product would be available 
in top chains across the land, today their eight prepackaged flavors are sold 
only at Trader Joe's, Price Club and a few mom-and-pop places. In fact, Fink 
said, grocery sales have shrunk to $200,000 from $1 million in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Here's why, he said. In February, 1985, Two Count Inc., a Haagen-Dazs 
distributor based in Newark, Calif., agreed to distribute Double Rainbow. 
Haagen-Dazs soon dropped Two Count, saying it demanded loyalty by its 
independent distributors. After that, Fink said, other big distributors would 
not touch Double Rainbow. 
</P>
<P>
Fink, an intense, bearded man, figures that the distribution woes "stopped us 
in our tracks." Current annual sales of $3.5 million, he said, are well shy of 
the $40 million he estimates that the company could have done on a national 
scale. (He estimates that Haagen-Dazs sales in the last five years have surged 
to $275 million from $80 million.) 
</P>
<P>
He noted that Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade, a Vermont ice cream company, fought a 
similar battle with Haagen-Dazs over distribution. That case was settled in 
1984, after the firm waged a campaign against Pillsbury with the slogan, 
"What's the Doughboy Afraid Of?" 
</P>
<P>
The settlement allowed Ben &amp; Jerry's to use Haagen-Dazs distributors in two 
Northeastern states long enough so that it could develop its own network. 
</P>
<P>
In the last few years, Fink added, many small start-ups in the super-premium 
ice cream business have failed or been bought by large companies with deep 
pockets for promotion and litigation. Philip Morris Cos.' Kraft unit, for 
example, owns Frusen Gladje. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Walsh, Two Count's president and one of the founder's four sons, said the 
loss of Haagen-Dazs, which represented 40% of the company's business, has taken 
a severe toll on his company as well. Two Count has since rapidly expanded its 
distribution in an effort to recoup the lost business, but profits have 
suffered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Fink's campaign, his comments reek of resignation. 
</P>
<P>
"If I never win this lawsuit," he said, "I still make a great ice cream." 
Double Rainbow may have to be content with just being "a successful local 
company." 
</P>
<P>
But with a hint of the old defiance that once prompted him to demonstrate 
outside Pillsbury's Minneapolis headquarters in 20-below weather, he added: "I 
never thought I'd (spend) five years trying to get in front of a jury. . . . 
We're survivors. (But) I'm real scared for the small businessman in America."

Tinker Closes Division: GTG Entertainment, the joint venture between former NBC 
Chairman Grant Tinker and Gannett Co., has closed its New York-based 
syndication division and let go another 10 employees based at its Culver City 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
GTG had hoped to launch two shows in syndication this fall, but their fate is 
now in doubt. Last week, Gannett said it would no longer finance GTG after 
March 31. The independent producer employs about 250 people, of which 160 are 
associated with the "Baywatch" series on NBC. A spokesman said Tinker has two 
pilot commitments at CBS and expressed confidence that a backer could be found 
if CBS decided to order the shows for next season.

It has been said that no institution in the United States tells us as much 
about ourselves as the supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
The graying of America, the move toward a service-oriented economy, the 
emergence of new ethnic groups and the expanding role of women in the labor 
market have all had an impact on the supermarket shelf. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the leading supermarkets tell us that consumers are no longer dominated 
by national brands or tastes. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, new consumer tastes and life styles are only the most visible of 
the changes that are rewriting the rules for the supermarket business. What was 
once the conventional supermarket will, before the decade is over, become quite 
unconventional by today's standards. Already these stores are being challenged 
by such competitors as hypermarkets, wholesale clubs, discount stores and 
grocery-outlet stores. Hypermarkets are huge, combination discount-retail and 
grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, manufacturers can no longer depend on "national" tastes to support 
national brands. Changing demographics, ethnic population bases and life styles 
all have helped make the mass market less relevant. Now, regional -- even local 
-- tastes and economics are more important in the food industry than in perhaps 
any other retailing business. This helps to explain why few American 
supermarket chains can compete successfully in several metropolitan markets and 
why chains such as A&amp;P, Safeway and Kroger have pulled out of many cities 
while focusing on particular regions. Simultaneously, such companies as 
Albertson's, Vons and Ralphs have developed several formats to fit local market 
conditions and real estate economics. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from changes in consumer tastes, two other factors have played a strong 
role in regionalization in recent years. The first is higher freight and 
distribution costs. Because of deregulation of the trucking industry and the 
reduced control of unions over distribution centers, retailers can serve 
regional areas economically, but they have a harder time maintaining warehouses 
in several parts of the country. And as stores turn over more space to 
perishable items -- seafood counters, salad bars, delis, bakeries and flower 
shops -- distribution centers that can respond faster and more frequently have 
become even more important. 
</P>
<P>
A second change driving regional concentration has been advertising. In the 
1980s, the costs of conventional advertising (TV, radio, newspapers) increased 
faster than the supermarket industry's ability to raise prices. This has forced 
retailers to concentrate stores in large urban areas to get the most out of 
their advertising dollar. The loss of many TV viewers to cable and VCRs also 
has made national advertising campaigns less cost effective. 
</P>
<P>
If they are to survive and prosper in this new retailing world, manufacturers 
and retailers will have to find the best ways to reach target markets and to 
customize not only products but also packaging, pricing, promotions and support 
systems. And while retailers are trying to respond even faster to consumer 
whims, they will have to keep perishable inventories to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
The only way to do all this effectively will be through technology. Retailers 
are just beginning to tap the full potential of their investment in 
technologies such as scanning equipment and warehouse information systems. 
Besides ringing up the price of an item on the cash register, scanners will 
provide detailed receipts, eliminating cashier mistakes and letting customers 
review individual prices and ask for subtotals. Scanners also will give store 
managers minute-by-minute details of purchases and automatically generate 
orders to replenish stock. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the complex information and management systems installed in 
the 1990s will help stores improve operating performance and return on assets. 
Often these systems will be tied into suppliers' systems to cut costs and 
increase efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the information generated by scanners, as well as other information, 
will be fed into another form of technology: electronic data interchange (EDI). 
A $300 delivery of potato chips may require the same paper work as a $30,000 
warehouse delivery, so using EDI to exchange ordering, billing, shipping and 
receiving information among retailers and suppliers will return significant 
benefits, particularly in the elimination or improvement of time-consuming, 
error-producing clerical work. 
</P>
<P>
EDI will also find a use in the home. It has been estimated that by the 
mid-1990s, one-third of all grocery shopping will be done through interactive 
home videotext communications devices, with payment via a debit card. EDI 
systems will create the networks that provide banking and at-home (even in-car) 
shopping services. 
</P>
<P>
As retailers use scanners and EDI systems to build elaborate federations of 
linked companies and meet customers' changing needs and tastes, food 
manufacturers will be forced to go along. They will have to invest in the 
technologies that allow them to participate in these federations. 
</P>
<P>
In sum, the burden has shifted. Retailers that survived the restructuring of 
the food industry in the 1980s are stronger and more sophisticated. They will 
control the 1990s. Manufacturers, who used to simply offer products and expect 
retailers to find shelf space for them, will also have to develop strategies 
for different markets and population groups, increase marketing expenses to 
support those strategies and invest in the technology required to meet 
retailers' -- and consumers' -- needs.

SCHULHOF EXPECTED TO BE NAMED SONY USA PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Michael P. Schulhof, vice chairman of Sony Corp. of America and the man who 
spearheaded Sony Corp.'s expansion into the U.S. entertainment business, is 
expected today to be named president of Sony USA Inc., the holding company for 
all of Sony's U.S. interests. He will relinquish his title at Sony Corp. of 
America but remain on the subsidiary's board of directors. Schulhof previously 
was deputy president of Sony USA. 
</P>
<P>
In this newly created position, Schulhof said he will be responsible for 
developing "synergies" among Sony's American businesses, which include CBS 
Records, Columbia Pictures Entertainment and the Sony line of consumer and 
professional electronic products. "Sony is now looking at ways to promote 
synergies between the hardware and the software sides," Schulhof said. "We need 
a year to digest all the acquisitions we've done recently." 
</P>
<P>
Masaaki Morita, brother of Sony Corp. founder and Chairman Akio Morita, retains 
his title as chairman and chief executive of Sony Corp. of America and deputy 
president of the Japanese parent but also is given the additional title of vice 
chairman of Sony USA. Both will report directly to Norio Ohga, president and 
chief executive of Sony Corp. in Japan, who also holds the title of chairman of 
Sony USA. 
</P>
<P>
Schulhof, who was the first American to get a seat on the board of a major 
Japanese company, is the man most publicly identified with Sony's thrust into 
the U.S. entertainment business. With what seemed to be a blank check from the 
giant electronics concern, Schulhof has made many in the business nervous about 
Sony's designs on the American entertainment industry. The move confirms 
Schulhof's reputation as a strategist who now must make the bits of Sony's U.S. 
puzzle fit together. Although Sony has spent nearly $6 billion acquiring high 
profile U.S. entertainment assets over the past two years, it still remains to 
be seen if Sony can use the "hardware" side -- an ever-increasingly 
sophisticated array of television sets, video recorders, video cameras and the 
like -- to fuel an appetite on the "software" side for films, television 
programs and the home videocassettes. 
</P>
<P>
He cited as examples of synergy Sony's research into high-definition television 
production at Columbia's new studios in Culver City. And Sony and CBS Records 
are exploring how Sony's development and marketing of digital audio tape will 
effect the recorded music business. 
</P>
<P>
Although Schulhof will hold one of Sony's most senior posts in America, he will 
not be directly responsible for operating any U.S. companies. Columbia co-heads 
Peter Guber and Jon Peters, as well as CBS Records president Walter Yetnikoff, 
will continue to report to Ohga, as they have in the past. 
</P>
<P>
In a related move, Sony Corp. of America announced yesterday that Ron Sommer, 
president of Sony Deutschland GmbH, would join the American subsidiary as 
deputy president, a new position. JOHN LIPPMAN

ANALYSTS SEE RECORD YEAR FOR JUNK BOND DEFAULTS; 
</P>
<P>
SECURITIES: SO FAR THIS YEAR, THE TOTAL IS MORE THAN $3 BILLION, COMPARED TO 
$5.4 BILLION FOR ALL OF LAST YEAR.

<P>
Junk bonds -- whose sales declined sharply in a battered market last year -- 
could face even deeper woes this year as a record number of the high-risk, 
high-yield securities go into default, some analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
Already this year, junk bond defaults have totaled more than $3 billion, 
compared to $5.4 billion for all of last year. The amount of defaults this year 
is more than nine times the $350 million in newly issued junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very likely that we will see a record year" for junk bond defaults, said 
Cynthia Latta, senior economist at Data Resources Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The $200-billion junk bond market has deteriorated in recent months as 
investors have shied away from the risky securities. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the brokerage Drexel Burnham Lambert, which virtually created the 
market in the late 1970s, collapsed. Its parent company filed for bankruptcy 
protection and began liquidating, creating a void in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel pleaded guilty to securities charges in 1988 and agreed to pay $650 
million in fines, while Michael Milken, former head of the brokerage's junk 
bond division, faces a raft of charges. 
</P>
<P>
"Further declines in credit quality among high-yield issuers are expected, as 
are more defaults and exchanges," said Thomas Razukas, senior vice president at 
Fitch Investors Service Inc. Cash flow forecasts of some issuers were overly 
optimistic, he said in a report. 
</P>
<P>
Junk bonds are rated as below investment grade, but Milken was able to create a 
huge market for the securities by convincing investors that their high yields 
offset the occasional failure of an issuer. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate raiders found junk bonds an ideal way to raise money but then 
depended on asset sales to pay down their debt quickly. Poor cash flow and a 
lack of bidders for assets have imperiled heavily leveraged companies such as 
Canada's Campeau Corp., the owner of the Federated and Allied department store 
units. 
</P>
<P>
With the prospect for slower economic growth in the short term, many companies 
that issued junk bonds in the mid-1980s will face tough times ahead, Latta 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, some brokers still believe that junk bonds can be a smart 
investment for certain clients.

REQUEST DROPPED FOR DREXEL EXAMINER 
</P>

The lead creditor to Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. withdrew a request 
Tuesday for a court-appointed examiner in the bankruptcy case, as the two sides 
neared a deal about who should manage the dissolution of the Wall Street firm. 
</P>
<P>
The firm and its creditors were negotiating about a proposal to allow a 
triumvirate of Drexel board members to oversee the firm, with input from 
creditors, as it liquidates under Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by lead creditor First City Bancorp. of Texas to withdraw its 
request for an examiner was a sign the Drexel board members were likely to 
continue directing the liquidation. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel's creditors had sought an examiner in the case because of concerns about 
the rapid liquidation of billions of dollars in securities holdings and other 
assets by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the brokerage subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
The brokerage firm is not subject to bankruptcy court proceedings but the asset 
sales, the movement of capital from the subsidiary to the parent company prior 
to the collapse and other links prompted anxious creditors to seek an examiner. 
</P>
<P>
In a bid to prevent the appointment, which Drexel officials contended would 
hamstring the company's day-to-day management, Drexel asked U.S. District Judge 
Howard Buschman III to allow three board members led by Chairman John S. R. 
Shad to oversee the dismantling of the parent and all subsidiaries.

year ago.

<P>
Sales increased 8% to $343.4 million. The Los Angeles company said the results 
reflected lower-than-anticipated sales increases, along with delays in cost 
containment measures. Higher labor, rental, insurance and interest expenses 
also contributed, as well as a non-recurring $2-million pretax charge related 
to bad debt provisions and employee health-care benefits. Rykoff-Sexton Inc.

In the Antelope Valley, it was the anti-gang dress code. 
</P>
<P>
In Chicago, it was the firing of school principals. 
</P>
<P>
In Contra Costa County, school budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
In Huntington Beach and Anaheim, it was the disqualification of football teams 
from the state playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The students who took to the streets in angry protest at two South Bay high 
schools Monday and Tuesday are part of a recent explosion in campus activism, 
the likes of which has not been seen since the civil rights and anti-war 
movements of late 1960s and early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"The protest strategy is out there in the repertoire of political action 
again," said Gary Orfield, a professor of political science and education at 
the University of Chicago. "Somehow, despite a generation gap and with no big 
movement and no big leaders, these kids are getting the idea that they can use 
their First Amendment rights and go demonstrate." 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the high school protests run the gamut from demonstrating 
against racial injustice to venting anger over the football team's being 
disqualified from championship playoffs. Educators who have been monitoring 
trends among students say they have been seeing a definite rise in campus 
activism recently but add that what is happening now does not necessarily 
represent a revival of the social and political involvement of the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, high school demonstrations are not new and, in some instances, 
represent nothing more than kids just being kids, some educators note. 
</P>
<P>
But others say that today's students are a generation that has watched on 
television as democratic protest has spread around the world, and they are 
applying those lessons to their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
Such activism bothers some administrators. But others who work with young 
people are welcoming the new wave of activism as long as it excludes violence, 
such as occurred in Chicago and the two South Bay high schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel it's a very, very healthy kind of thing as long as it is not violent," 
said Nancy Pinson-Millburn of the American Assn. for Counseling and 
Development. 
</P>
<P>
"What students are learning from what has happened in China, in Eastern Europe 
and (in various cities throughout the U.S.) is that it is OK to speak up, that 
students ought to be listened to. We find that kind of encouraging." 
</P>
<P>
In the high schools, the issues are close to home: dirty, unsafe or ineffective 
schools; students' rights; unpopular decisions or policies. And the motivations 
are sometimes mixed. 
</P>
<P>
This week's demonstrations at Leuzinger and Hawthorne high schools in the South 
Bay's Centinela Valley Union High School District, for example, were sparked by 
the resignation of a popular principal who faced reassignment by district 
trustees. As many as 2,000 students took to the streets Monday; there was a 
smaller morning-long demonstration Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
While the immediate issue was the resignation of the principal, the protest 
also encompassed allegations of racism against the school board. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's right to fight for your rights," said Miguel Cortez, 16, in 
explaining why he was demonstrating Tuesday at Leuzinger High. "If you're 
Mexican, you have to have pride in your nation. And if you're black, you have 
to have pride in your color." 
</P>
<P>
But Leuzinger sophomore Carmen Humphrey said others were less sincere: 
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday, we participated because there was a cause," Humphrey said Tuesday. 
"Today, we didn't because what they're doing is just for fun. It's just hurting 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Some educators trace the upsurge locally to last year's Los Angeles teachers 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
Stalled contract negotiations between teachers and the Los Angeles Unified 
School District led to the largest wave of student-led protests in the schools 
in nearly 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 students at dozens of campuses participated in walkouts, 
sit-ins and protest marches around the two-week teachers strike. 
</P>
<P>
"Some students were genuinely supporting the teachers' demands and felt that 
the (school) board was wrong," recalled Richard Browning, consultant to the 
district's senior high schools. "Other students were afraid that their grades 
were being interfered with" because teachers threatened not to release grades 
until a contract was signed, jeopardizing graduation and college admission for 
some students, he said. 
</P>
<P>
What is happening now on high school and even some junior high school campuses 
mirrors the findings of the latest national survey of college freshmen. It 
showed a dramatic rise in activism. 
</P>
<P>
About 37% of this year's freshmen said they had participated in organized 
demonstrations the year before entering college. That contrasts with about 21% 
in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a general feeling that there are things in this culture that 
need fixing, that there are issues that have been put on hold and that must be 
addressed," said Alexander W. Astin, a UCLA professor of education and director 
of the annual freshman survey. Published in January, this year's survey 
involved almost 296,000 freshmen at 587 campuses. 
</P>
<P>
That heightened level of activism has shown up in recent protests at high 
schools and junior highs around the country. They include: 
</P>
<P>
Selma, Ala., where about 150 black high school students staged lengthy sit-ins 
after the white-controlled school board decided not to renew the contract of 
its black superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago, where the firings of several principals touched off waves of student 
protests in several neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Northern California's Contra Costa County, where about 2,000 students at four 
high schools marched and picketed at their campuses to protest teacher layoffs 
and other budget cuts they said would hurt their education. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley High School in Lancaster, the Westside's University High, 
Monrovia High and Peary Junior High School in Gardena -- where students hit the 
bricks over new dress codes. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood, where students streamed out of Morningside High School and went to 
district offices to complain about dirty restrooms, textbook shortages, gang 
activities and unqualified substitute teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Cantwell High School in Montebello, where students at the parochial boys' 
school staged a two-hour walkout when the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los 
Angeles announced it was replacing the schools' priests and teachers from the 
Congregation of Christian Brothers with others from the Jesuit order. 
</P>
<P>
Two Orange County high schools -- Savanna in Anaheim and Huntington Beach High 
-- where last November, students walked out of classes to protest their 
football teams' disqualification from playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Marine View School in Huntington Beach, where about 100 seventh- and 
eighth-graders streamed off campus after they were told the traditional field 
trips to Yosemite and Santa Catalina Island might be canceled because of 
bogged-downed contract talks with teachers. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's Astin said his survey of entering college freshmen showed that today's 
students are different from their counterparts of almost a quarter-century ago. 
</P>
<P>
"For one thing, we still have a very large and influential group of students 
who are looking out for money and jobs and getting ahead," Astin said. "But 
there is a rapidly growing minority of activists that are becoming more 
influential and a force to be reckoned with." 
</P>
<P>
Some administrators, believe students are more conservative now, more concerned 
about things they believe will affect them directly. 
</P>
<P>
During the dress code protest at Antelope Valley High, Angela Bruno, a 
14-year-old freshman, was moved to boycott classes by uncertainty over what 
what attire was permitted: 
</P>
<P>
"How are we supposed to know what we can wear if they won't tell us? Why don't 
they go out and buy us our own outfits?" 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations often are aimed at changing school policy. 
</P>
<P>
That was the goal of a youth at Palmdale High School who objected to school 
officials' condemning protests of the Antelope Valley district's dress code and 
disciplining participants. "They tell us it's wrong, but a lot of things in 
history were done through protesting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, some administrators say lessons learned during the student 
demonstrations in the '60s have helped to keep many campuses calm during the 
renewed tide of activism. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the protests in the '60s and '70s had to do with student power," Los 
Angeles Unified's Browning said. Now students have more vehicles for 
participating in the running of schools. 
</P>
<P>
In cities like Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles, students serve on school 
committees that help make the rules, and in most places administrators are more 
sensitive to being responsive to student concerns than they were 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"An issue came up here not long ago where kids were interested in ethnic 
studies classes," said Marvin Starr, principal of Los Angeles' Manual Arts High 
School. "That had been a big issue in the '60s, when students had to fight to 
get them. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, we talked about it with the students and we reinstituted them. We don't 
believe it should get to the point of protest anymore," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But, like their counterparts in the 1960s, some students today are suspicious 
that people over 30 might have lost their stake in social change. 
</P>
<P>
At Leuzinger High School on Tuesday, Supt. McKinley Nash tried to use the image 
of the 1960s to encourage students to return to class. He told them about being 
jailed during civil rights protests in the South, and his days on the stump 
with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
But the angry students shouted him down and stormed out of the auditorium. 
Later, outside the school, Malcolm Ratliff, a 17-year-old Leuzinger student, 
said that if Nash still believed in what King stood for, the superintendent 
"would be out there with us, fighting this to the end."

GOOD NEWS? The outcome of a huge case involving the Newhouse publishing empire 
and the IRS is said to have encouraged the Irvine Co. in its battle with 
heiress Joan Irvine Smith. . . . Newhouse heirs won a court victory over the 
IRS, which had valued the Newhouse chain at $2 billion and demanded $600 
million in taxes. . . . The Newhouse family said it was worth $250 million . . 
. . Similarly, Irvine Co. Chairman Donald L. Bren says the firm was only worth 
$1 billion when he bought it; Smith says it was worth $3 billion. . . . A court 
decision is expected soon. Kristina Lindgren and Mark Pinsky

DISRESPECT: There's a war of words in the otherwise dormant race for state 
treasurer. . . . It started when Democratic contender Kathleen Brown referred 
to one Republican opponent as an "Orange County gal". . . . That would be 
Republican Angela (Bay) Buchanan of Irvine. . . . Buchanan, a former U.S. 
treasurer, lashed back, accusing Brown of "the worst kind of condescension and 
disrespect" for women in politics and said Brown "must think the women of 
Orange County are dull, politically unsophisticated or not very bright." So 
far, no response from Brown. Kristina Lindgren and Mark Pinsky

UNDAUNTED: Although Ron Kovic has announced that he will not run for Congress 
(B1), Democrats here still hope to reclaim two marginal local districts. . . . 
Party analysts say there may be as many as 36,000 "unregistered potential loyal 
Democrats" in Curt Pringle's (R-Garden Grove) 72nd Assembly District, which 
overlaps with the congressional seat held by Rep. Robert K. Dornan. . . . Now, 
Democrats say, they must find these voters and register them. Kristina Lindgren

CITY VYING FOR AUTO DEALERSHIPS, TAXES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
City officials have launched an effort to lure lucrative, tax-generating auto 
dealerships to its "auto row" redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park has lost three dealerships to the city of La Mirada -- creating an 
annual tax loss of about $1 million -- and has lured one dealership from 
Fullerton since it began competing with nearby cities. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park officials approached three Fullerton dealerships and persuaded 
Fullerton Lincoln Mercury to move to Buena Park, said Mai Hui, acting deputy 
director of the Redevelopment Agency. The dealership plans to open in March, 
1991, as part of the auto row planned at Manchester Boulevard and Stanton 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
To entice Fullerton Lincoln Mercury, the city offered the land at a reduced 
rate, Hui said. In return, the dealer guaranteed to generate at least $300,000 
in sales-tax revenue each year. The dealership is also expected to provide 
another $30,000 per year in property tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
The city still is trying to lure University Acura and McClaren BMW from 
Fullerton, Hui said. 
</P>
<P>
If all three dealerships moved, Buena Park could receive more than $1 million 
in taxes each year to help offset the city's growing budget deficit, which is 
close to $1 million, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton Redevelopment Manager Terry Galvin said a lack of space prevents that 
city from offering similar incentives. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a lot of vacant space to work with," Galvin said. Therefore, 
dealerships are able to get a better deal elsewhere, he said. 
</P>
<P>
While Fullerton has not been able to fend off the advances of Buena Park, La 
Mirada has already acquired three Buena Park dealerships for its new La Mirada 
Auto Center. 
</P>
<P>
Gateway Chevrolet, Ted Jones Ford and Williams Volvo are expected to move into 
the redevelopment project along Artesia Boulevard just off the Santa Ana 
Freeway, said Community Resource Director Thomas Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Having direct, freeway visibility gave them an advantage over other cities, 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
By moving four-tenths of a mile, which puts it directly off the freeway, 
Gateway Chevrolet is expected to increase its sales between 10 and 20%, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said La Mirada officials are still recruiting from other areas to find 
buyers for its auto center. 
</P>
<P>
"It is part of a friendly competition between cities. If you don't compete for 
the better revenue producers, you fall behind," Robinson said. LYNDA NATALI

COMPANIES TO MATCH $200,000 FOR SOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The embattled charity Share Our Selves has been offered a $200,000 challenge 
grant from the Fieldstone Co., a Newport Beach home-builder, and the 
Irvine-based Fieldstead &amp; Co. to help buy a new home for the organization, 
the charity's directors announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Donations for the purchase that are received by SOS before July 1 will be 
matched dollar for dollar by the two firms, up to a total of $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives us a big boost," SOS founder and Executive Director Jean Forbath 
said. "I am particularly enthused (that two such businesses) would show this 
kind of confidence and leadership." 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit charity, which provides varied social services for the needy, is 
negotiating to buy a $1.4-million, 12,000-square-foot industrial building at 
1550 Superior Ave. 
</P>
<P>
SOS was forced to seek new quarters after the City Council ordered it to move 
from its current home in the city-managed Rea Community Center, 661 Hamilton 
St., reacting to complaints from neighbors about the charity's clientele. 
</P>
<P>
Although some businesses and the Costa Mesa Chamber of Commerce object to the 
charity's proposed site, the city Planning Commission last week approved a 
conditional permit for the building. However, the approval was appealed, and a 
final decision will be made by the City Council on March 19. 
</P>
<P>
Forbath said the charity has opened a trust account for building donations. If 
the purchase falls through or the conditional use permit is not granted, all 
money will be returned to donors. 
</P>
<P>
SOS Chairman Scott Mather said the organization hopes to raise at least $1 
million before the close of escrow so SOS can "continue to serve the poor 
without interruption and without a heavy mortgage draining all (our) 
resources." 
</P>
<P>
The SOS building fund has already received nearly $300,000 in donations, 
including a $100,000 gift from John Michler, vice president of Hunsaker &amp; 
Associates. CARLA RIVERA

JUDGE HALTS BUILDING FOR CITY PLAN UPDATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE NICOLOSI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Orange County Superior Court judge on Tuesday blocked the city from issuing 
any building permits for residential development until officials update Seal 
Beach's general plan, a blueprint for commercial and residential development. 
</P>
<P>
State law mandates that general plans be updated every five years, but Seal 
Beach's plan has not been revised since 1982. Seal Beach officials expect to 
approve a revised general plan by late April. 
</P>
<P>
The court's decision represents a partial ruling in a December, 1989, lawsuit 
in which the Wetlands Restoration Society sought to block a development that 
the group claims will destroy 105 acres of wetlands in northwest Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The society is also asking the court to invalidate a land-use permit that the 
city granted for the 329-unit residential project proposed by Mola Development 
Corp. As part of this development planned for the old Hellman Ranch property, 
Mola would restore about 40 acres of wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
The judge is expected to rule on the land-use permit later this week, society 
attorney Jonathan Lehrer-Graiwer said. 
</P>
<P>
Seal Beach City Manager Bob Nelson said officials don't know how to interpret 
Tuesday's verbal order by the judge. 
</P>
<P>
"We're disappointed with the decision, of course," Nelson said. "We don't know 
what kind of permits this will affect or if it applies to remodeling. . . . 
We're still waiting for an explanation from our lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Atty. Carol Lynch said city officials hope the ruling will apply 
only to new development. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine that the court would prevent us from approving remodeling," 
she said. "If someone wants to put a new bathtub in, we should be able to 
approve that." 
</P>
<P>
If the court rules that Mola's permit is invalid, the company would have to 
resubmit its project for City Council approval. 
</P>
<P>
"I think sooner or later, this development will be approved," said District 3 
Councilwoman Joyce Risner. "It's just updating that housing element. What I 
hope for is that everything will be determined valid. We've gone through so 
much on this." 
</P>
<P>
But society vice president Galen Ambrose believes there is a chance that the 
council will block the development if it is reconsidered. 
</P>
<P>
"If they don't try to rush this through before the citizens get a chance to 
elect a new council (March 27), there's a chance that the next council will 
vote differently," said Ambrose, who is running for City Council in District 3. 
</P>
<P>
Ambrose added that if the court rules that Mola's development agreement with 
the city is valid, the society will appeal that decision. MICHELLE NICOLOSI

POLICE SEEK HELP IN FINDING ATTACKER 
</P>

<P>
Police asked for the public's help Tuesday in finding a man who has assaulted a 
19-year-old Newport Beach woman three times in the past nine months. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent attack occurred last week when the man entered the woman's 
Newport Heights residence "through a ruse" and tried to rape her, Newport Beach 
Police Sgt. Andy Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
The man hit the woman in the head and fled when she activated an alarm in her 
home, Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
After the latest attack, the woman was able to give investigators a detailed 
description of her assailant, and a composite drawing was developed, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The first attack occurred in June when the woman, whose identity was not 
released, was accosted outside her home fter she returned from a late-night 
movie, Gonis said. The man ran when the woman fell to the ground screaming, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In September, she was assaulted again when the man broke into her car and hid, 
Gonis said. After the woman got into the car, she was ordered to drive around 
the neighborhood for about 30 minutes before the man fled, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The attacker, whose motive is unknown, is described as a Caucasian with olive 
complexion in his 30s, about 5 feet, 10 inches tall and 180 pounds, Gonis said.

HELP ASKED IN SEARCH FOR 2 RETARDED MEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Authorities are seeking the public's help in locating two mentally retarded men 
who have been missing for two days and were last seen leaving their homes to 
board a bus destined for Mission Viejo Mall. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Michael Neve, 22, and Rory Nichols, 35, boarded the bus at 8:30 a.m. 
Sunday from their El Toro homes, said Orange County Sheriff's Sgt. Richard 
Paddock. 
</P>
<P>
The pair has a fascination for visiting malls and beaches, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Neve is just over six feet tall, weighs 150 pounds and has hazel eyes and brown 
hair. He was last seen wearing a red jacket with tan sleeves, blue stonewashed 
jeans and white tennis shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols, who has a history of seizures and needs daily medication, is 5 feet, 8 
inches tall, 132 pounds, with brown eyes, curly blond hair and a noticeable 
chip in his upper front tooth. He may have been wearing a baseball cap and a 
long-sleeved shirt, Paddock said. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information is asked to call the sheriff's department at (714) 
647-7000 or investigator Mike Wallace at (714) 647-7055.

WHITTIER PROFESSOR CHALLENGES PETERSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY MARCANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Whittier College education professor filed nominating petitions in the race 
for Orange County superintendent of schools Tuesday, marking the first serious 
challenge in more than a decade for longtime schools chief Robert D. Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
John F. Dean, 63, a Newport Beach resident who has been chairman of Whittier's 
education department for 19 years, submitted 3,000 signatures to the county 
Board of Elections on Tuesday morning, officially placing him on the ballot for 
the June 5 election. 
</P>
<P>
"I surveyed district superintendents to find out how they felt about service 
out of the county office, and they were pretty unanimous in not being happy 
with it," Dean said. "Dr. Peterson has been around for 24 years, and they felt 
it was time for new leadership." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson, 69, who has been hounded by grand jury management investigations for 
nearly all of his years as county superintendent, announced in December that he 
would run for an unprecedented seventh four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
Despite years of complaints from district administrators that Peterson is out 
of touch with their needs, efforts to unseat him in elections have been 
unsuccessful. He ran unopposed in 1986 and received only token opposition in 
1982 from John Scott Inmon, then principal of Rancho San Joaquin Intermediate 
School in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Dean appeared unfazed by Peterson's formidable history but 
acknowledged that the superintendent is "pretty much entrenched." 
</P>
<P>
"For a nonpartisan race, you just have to alert the public that there's a real 
need for a change," Dean said. "I really think the county superintendent is one 
of the best-kept secrets in Orange County. People are really not aware that 
there is a county superintendent who makes $100,000 a year and controls a 
$60-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our public schools and the county Department of Education can be 
better in meeting the needs of all the kids, all the students, the bilingual 
and the gifted and the bright and the kids that need more help. I firmly 
believe the grand jury reports that have called for new leadership for years." 
</P>
<P>
Dean was referring to harsh grand jury reports that have consistently 
criticized Peterson's policies. Many of the reports called for abolition of the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
Noting Peterson's high name recognition, Dean said he plans to spend $250,000 
on the campaign, much of it in countywide mailings. 
</P>
<P>
"If he wants to win, he'd have to spend that much ($250,000) or more," Peterson 
said. Without specifying any dollars figures, Peterson added that he plans to 
"spend enough to win." In previously published reports, Peterson said he 
planned to spend about $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
Dean, an educator for 40 years, said he would bring "a strong background of 
public and private education" to the superintendent's post if elected. The 
majority of his public school service has been in the Newport-Mesa Unified 
School District, where he was principal of Harbor View elementary school in 
Corona del Mar and later director of curriculum for the district's elementary 
schools before joining the Whittier College staff. In recent years, he has 
served as dean of the evening college at Orange Coast College. TONY MARCANO

JOB CENTER VOTED FOR DAY LABORERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday night to approve a temporary 
downtown job center for dayworkers. Also approved was $14,000 to carry the 
center through the fiscal year that ends June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Brea's job center will be "open to all people seeking labor" and "will not be 
checking the residential and legal status" of the workers, said Ret Wixted, 
city parks and recreation director. "That's really the employer's 
responsibility," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Informational bulletins about the liabilities of hiring undocumented dayworkers 
will be available at the center. 
</P>
<P>
Employers from construction, landscaping, gardening, hotel and food industries 
will hire dayworkers from the center, Wixted said. 
</P>
<P>
Brea's Job Center grew out of an effort to improve the South Walnut area of 
downtown, Wixted said. Neighbors complain that dayworkers cause traffic and 
litter problems. 
</P>
<P>
A community panel studied the problem and recommended opening a job center. The 
facility will be administered by the Gary Center, a Brea-based nonprofit 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa and Orange have also set up centers for dayworkers.

$22.4 MILLION OKD FOR HEALTH PURPOSES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
By a 4-0 vote, Orange County supervisors Tuesday approved spending $22.4 
million in state tobacco tax funds on a health care agenda that includes trauma 
care, two birthing centers, community clinics and expanded health services for 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Half a dozen community leaders from United Way's Chauncey Alexander to Faith 
Hagerty of the Orange County Coalition of Community Clinics praised county 
officials for being "receptive," "reasonable" and taking the right step toward 
care of the county's poor. 
</P>
<P>
The money is Orange County's share of a new surtax levied on cigarette and 
other tobacco products under Proposition 99, a statewide initiative approved by 
voters in 1988. The law mandates that the funds be spent on health care. 
</P>
<P>
Allocation of the money may be weeks away because state officials still must 
review Orange County's plan. 
</P>
<P>
Key measures in the plan approved Monday include $2.3 million for new birthing 
centers for low-income women run by UCI Medical Center in Orange and Western 
Medical Center-Anaheim. The two facilities together are to handle up to 2,000 
deliveries a year and are expected to relieve severe overcrowding at UCI and 
other hospitals that care for low-income women. 
</P>
<P>
Another $6.7 million is to go to the county's three trauma centers. Of that, 
$125,000 has been reserved for a fourth trauma center that county officials are 
hoping will join the emergency network. 
</P>
<P>
Another $1.5 million would go to 12 community clinics that provide health 
services for low-income county residents. And following new state mandates, the 
county is spending about $1 million on expanded medical screening and treatment 
for children to include those up to age 19. (Previously, screenings stopped at 
age 6.) 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the money is to be distributed to local hospitals and physicians to 
reimburse them for medical care to indigent patients. LANIE JONES

MIKE PENNER: FIFTH TIME COULD BE CHARM FOR UCI 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
If you've never seen an Anteater cry, you've never seen UC Irvine play Cal 
State Fullerton in the Big West Conference basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Irvine had Kevin Magee and 23 victories, but couldn't beat Fullerton 
in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Irvine had Tod Murphy and Johnny Rogers, but couldn't beat Fullerton 
in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Irvine had two victories over Nevada Las Vegas in 13 days, and would 
later defeat UCLA in the National Invitation Tournament, but couldn't beat 
Fullerton in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Irvine had Scott Brooks and Wayne Englestad, but couldn't beat 
Fullerton in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Nice rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
If this was Orange County's own little Civil War, the only thing it had in 
common with the big one was that the South kept on losing. 
</P>
<P>
And if Bill Mulligan's best teams couldn't solve the riddle of the Titans, what 
chance does his 5-22 crew stand under the Long Beach Arena lights tonight? 
</P>
<P>
Memo to Jerry Tarkanian: Man-to-man will probably work best on Friday, now that 
the Rigdon kid is starting at guard. 
</P>
<P>
It's a perverse notion, but it's been a perverse season at Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters' odds of advancing against Fullerton have never been better. 
</P>
<P>
This ballot box is stuffed with reasons why Irvine ought to be voted Most 
Likely To Play Pigeon To Las Vegas In The Quarters. Good ones, too. 
</P>
<P>
Current Events: Fullerton's losing streak -- seven in a row -- isn't half as 
long as the 15-game skidmark Irvine left on the months of December, January and 
February. But the key here is timing. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters' worst days are behind them. The Titans' are still with them. 
Irvine is 3-2 in its past five games. Fullerton is 0-7 in its past seven. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans haven't won in more than a month, not since Feb. 3 against Utah 
State, and have lost both of their last two games by 18 points. One of those 
defeats came against Irvine, which brings us to Reason No. 2 . . . 
</P>
<P>
Last Time Around: Both Fullerton-Irvine games this season have been blowouts. 
On Jan. 25 at Titan Gym, Fullerton won by 27 points. On Feb. 24 at the Bren 
Center, Irvine won by 18. 
</P>
<P>
That's a 45-point turnaround, which speaks volumes about what's happened to 
these teams in the past month. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters have pulled their act together since pulling three starters after 
the Titan Gym thrashing and replacing them with The Three Freshmen. Dylan 
Rigdon moved in at off-guard, Jeff Von Lutzow at forward and Craig Marshall at 
small forward. Very small forward. Marshall stands all of 6 feet, 2 inches. 
</P>
<P>
In the nine games following Mulligan's lineup switch, Rigdon is averaging 17.1 
points. He had 26 in the victory over Fullerton, a phenomenal nine-for-nine 
shooting performance that included seven strikes from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
The contributions of Marshall and Von Lutzow have been less statistically 
tangible, but their quickness and leaping ability has made a noticeable 
difference on the Anteater front line. So has their enthusiasm, a foreign word 
around Fullerton in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Inside: The Titans lost their center in mid-February. The Anteaters reclaimed 
theirs about the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton didn't have much of an inside game to start with. Then, Coach John 
Sneed kicked John Sykes off the team and David Moody was left to fend for 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
More often than not, it hasn't been a fair fight. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Ricky Butler stirred on the Irvine bench and, at last, 
re-established himself as the player Mulligan thought he had been all along: A 
leader in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
In the Anteaters' past five games, Butler is shooting 71.2% from the field and 
averaging 19 points. More than that, he finally has vacated Mulligan's 
doghouse. 
</P>
<P>
Tough to hit the jumper from there. 
</P>
<P>
Outside: The Titans lived on the perimeter for a season and a half. Now, 
they're dying on it. 
</P>
<P>
Since its last victory, Fullerton is shooting 40.5% from the field. Cedric 
Ceballos has held up his end -- he's shooting 49% and averaging 23.2 points a 
game -- but guards Mark Hill and Wayne Williams, alleged long-range 
specialists, are shooting 37% and 34% from the field, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Anteater outside shooting was a sad joke during the dregs of winter, but 
Rigdon's recent success from beyond 15 feet has been an almost nostalgic 
experience at Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
And the re-emergence of Jeff Herdman, now in the role of sixth-man, has helped 
offset the loss of Rod Palmer's jump shot (34.4%). 
</P>
<P>
The Time Is Right: Irvine is 0-4 against Fullerton in tournament games, but 
overall, the Anteaters have won six of the past nine meetings. And, for the 
first time in tournament play against the Titans, Irvine enters tonight's game 
with nothing to lose. 
</P>
<P>
Past defeats here have either been upsets or emotional crushers, depriving the 
Anteaters of NCAA berths and ruining otherwise fine seasons. 
</P>
<P>
This Irvine season was ruined long ago. What would one more loss mean? 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a victory would mean a quarterfinal sacrifice to Las Vegas, 
which means different things to Irvine and Fullerton. It all depends on the 
vantage point. A second-round loss to Las Vegas would be an accomplishment for 
the Anteaters, yet a disappointment for the Titans, considering the high hopes 
of November. 
</P>
<P>
If momentum and motivation are worth anything, this round in the War of the 
Oranges will go to Irvine.

<P>
Bill Foster had an empty feeling after his final game as coach at the 
University of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Only 2,397 fans showed up at 15,000-seat Miami Arena Tuesday night to see the 
Hurricanes defeat Florida International, 83-55. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave the the Hurricanes a 13-15 record and ended their worst season 
since Foster resurrected the program in 1985 after a 15-year hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some things we didn't get done that I'd have liked to get done, and 
that bothers me," Foster said. "It's a little bittersweet." 
</P>
<P>
Foster, who announced last fall that this season would his last with the 
Hurricanes, had a 78-71 record at Miami. His teams failed to earn a postseason 
bid and attendance was rarely more than 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Jerome Scott scored a career-high 22 points for the Hurricanes.

Lute Olson and the University of Arizona may be ready for Tony Clark, but St. 
Margaret's High School isn't. 
</P>
<P>
With Olson in attendance Tuesday night at Granite Hills High School to watch 
one of his recruits in a first-round Division V Southern California Regional 
boys' basketball playoff game, El Cajon Christian's Clark scorched St. 
Margaret's for 52 points. 
</P>
<P>
On a plateau far above Division V, the 6-foot-8 Clark matched St. Margaret's 
point for point. His teammates chipped in the rest for a 74-52 El Cajon 
Christian victory. 
</P>
<P>
Clark has averaged 44 points and 14 rebounds a game since transferring from 
Valhalla. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew Clark was going to get his points," St. Margaret's Coach Rick Bauer 
said. "We figured if we could hold him to 30 or 35 points we'd be all right." 
</P>
<P>
Clark had 29 points at halftime, including three first-quarter three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
Clark showcased his entire arsenal en route to 21-for-33 shooting from the 
field -- feather-touch rainbows from the perimeter, soft hooks in the lane, and 
rim-rattling, twin-fisted slam dunks. 
</P>
<P>
Amazingly, Clark's 52-point effort was not his season high. That came against 
La Jolla Country Day in a San Diego Section playoff game when he scored 64 
points. 
</P>
<P>
After a while, all St. Margaret's could do was watch. The Tartans, who won 18 
consecutive games this season, finished 21-6. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan Westendorf, St. Margaret's 6-7 center, finished with a team-high 17 
points. 
</P>
<P>
But Westendorf, who entered the game averaging 26 points, was slowed by an 
ankle injury he suffered in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if we had a healthy Westendorf guarding him, that guy wouldn't have 
scored 52 points," Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Dann Campaigne added 16 for the Tartans, and guard Trevor Durham added 
11, including a pair of three-pointers.

It was a game for Brea-Olinda High School's Aimee McDaniel to remember. But it 
might better be described as a game San Diego Lincoln would like to forget. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel scored 19 points and broke the the Brea-Olinda career girls' scoring 
mark, and the Lady Cats scored 35 consecutive points en route to a 66-32 
victory in a first round Southern California Regional basketball playoffs 
Division III game. 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda (31-0), which won Southern Section 3A and state Division III 
championships last season, will play host to Lemoore (21-7) in Thursday's 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel scored her record-breaking 1,779th point early in the first quarter 
Tuesday, breaking a mark set by Carrie Egan, who played at Brea-Olinda from 
1984-87. The game was stopped briefly and McDaniel, a senior, was presented the 
game ball. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a super moment," said Brea-Olinda Coach Mark Trakh, whose team won its 
53rd consecutive game. "This was her night." 
</P>
<P>
It certainly wasn't Lincoln's. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln (16-7), the San Diego Section Division III runner-up, scored late in 
the first quarter to cut Brea-Olinda's lead to 14-6. But Lincoln suffered 
through a scoreless second quarter, missing nine field goals and four free 
throws, and did not score again until early in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda's press caused the most problems for Lincoln, which committed 31 
turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
While Lincoln was struggling, Brea-Olinda was scoring in bunches . . . and 
bunches. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel scored on a layup, which set the record, and added a three-point 
basket to start the Lady Cats' run. By halftime, Brea-Olinda led, 47-6. 
</P>
<P>
"This was our night," McDaniel said. "We came in really psyched. We were at 
home, with our fans and we didn't think anything could beat us. We came in and 
everything clicked." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lincoln struggled with the fundamentals. Lincoln committed 31 
turnovers, including 20 in the first half, and was two of 19 from the 
free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't make your free throws and have too many turnovers, you can't 
play," Lincoln Coach Dorothy Robinson said. "My girls have to stop letting the 
officials upset them." 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda took its biggest lead at 58-10 with about five minutes left in the 
third quarter. Trakh pulled his starters soon after taking the 48-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Tammy Blackburn, who had several steals to lead Brea-Olinda's pressure 
defense, scored 15 points. Sheila Dixon, a 6-foot-3 junior, led Lincoln with 18 
points and 16 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the way we're going to have to play every night if we want to win 
state again," McDaniel said.

JALEWALIA RELIEVES PRESSURE AS LA QUINTA WINS, 44-38

<P>
The La Quinta and Sanger high school girls' basketball teams were feeling the 
pressure Tuesday night in the opening round of the Southern California Division 
II regional girls' basketball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Sanger felt the crush of a full-court press and a half-court trap that forced 
the Apaches into 30 turnovers. La Quinta felt the pressure that comes with 
continually missing open shots and turning in a 12-of-60 shooting performance. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Amy Jalewalia stepped forward and ignored the pressure, hitting 10 of 
10 free throws and a three-point basket in the fourth quarter to give La Quinta 
a 44-38 victory at La Quinta. The Aztecs (28-2) will play San Diego Point Loma 
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Sanger (20-12) started the game in a man defense but quickly switched to a 
box-and-one after Jalewalia scored the Aztecs' 10 first-quarter points. 
</P>
<P>
"We worked on the box-and-one all week because we knew she was a tremendous 
player," Sanger Coach Roy Tanimoto said. 
</P>
<P>
Until the fourth quarter, Jalewalia struggled with Erika Rodriguez or Renee 
DeCanio shadowing her at all times. The rest of the Apaches formed a four-man 
zone around the key, inviting the Aztecs to shoot from the perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs obliged, taking the shots. Making them was a different story, 
however. Excluding Jalewalia, the Aztec starters finished with a combined 13 
points. 
</P>
<P>
"In the CIF playoffs we were getting good performances from the (perimeter)," 
La Quinta Coach Kevin Kiernan said. "They were knocking it down and getting 
teams out of gimmick defenses. Tonight I thought we would do it again because 
we were at home, but we didn't." 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta disrupted Sanger's offensive rhythm with defensive pressure, holding 
Sanger to five-of-26 shooting in the second half. "We just couldn't stop the 
number of turnovers they forced us into," Tanimoto said. "A very fine ballclub 
beat us." 
</P>
<P>
Or a better ball player. Team Jalewalia scored 31 points, 16 from the free 
throw line, and had 14 rebounds, five steals and three blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs trailed, 22-20, at halftime, but outscored the Apaches, 8-0, at the 
start of the third quarter to take a 28-22 lead with 3:48 to play in the 
quarter. Sanger took the lead again, 30-29, on center Cathy Isom's three-point 
play a minute into the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But Jalewalia made a three-point basket to give La Quinta the lead for good. 
Isom, Sanger's leading scorer with 16 points, fouled out with Sanger down, 
38-35, and 1 1/2 minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
Jalewalia made it to the free throw line five times in the final quarter. She 
scored 13 of La Quinta's 15 points as the Aztecs outscored Sanger, 15-11.

MORNINGSIDE BEATS BUENA, 56-49; LESLIE LEADS WAY WITH 30

<P>
Surviving an upset bid for the second consecutive game, Inglewood Morningside 
High beat Ventura Buena Tuesday night in the first round of the girls' Southern 
California Regional basketball playoffs, 56-49. 
</P>
<P>
Center Lisa Leslie, who left the game with her fourth foul 3:10 into the third 
quarter and the top-seeded Monarchs (29-3) leading, 39-28, finished with 30 
points, nine rebounds and 12 blocked shots in 29 minutes of play. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs (26-2), who were led by forward Mia Palkie's 15 points, went on a 
7-0 run immediately after Leslie's exit. Palkie's basket off an offensive 
rebound brought Buena within four points at 45-41 going into the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But when Leslie returned to the game with 5:05 to play, the Bulldogs hadn't 
scored in the quarter and trailed 47-41. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie made a 15-foot jump shot despite being triple-teamed to give the 
Monarchs a 53-45 lead with 2:33 to play. A three-point basket by guard Princess 
Murray gave Morningside a 56-47 lead with 53 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Jennifer Wells had 14 points for the Bulldogs, including five in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
With a 35-22 halftime lead, it looked like Morningside might coast the rest of 
the way -- but Monarch Coach Frank Scott knew better. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, when you get this far, none of them are easy," Scott said. "They scared 
us half to death." 
</P>
<P>
Scott said that he didn't seriously consider putting Leslie back in the game 
while Buena was making a run. "We're just fortunate we were able to maintain a 
lead while she was out of there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And Leslie said she didn't ask to return to the game. "No, definitely not," she 
said. "That's what got me in trouble last time out against Lynwood (in the 
Southern Section 5-AA title game victory Friday)." 
</P>
<P>
Morningside needs to win Thursday and Saturday to go to Oakland for the State 
Division I championship game for the third consecutive year.

NEWEST CHEAP 'SEATS' BELONG TO THE NYSE

<P>
In the mid-1970s, owning a yellow cab in the world's financial capital cost 
more than a seat on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Things aren't that grim today, but with the stock market falling and the 
securities industry in a recession, the price of membership on the nation's 
oldest and largest exchange has sunk to its lowest level in almost five years. 
</P>
<P>
A "seat" -- which entitles members to trade directly on the stock exchange 
floor -- sold for $365,000 Thursday, down from the all-time high of $1.15 
million in September, 1987, a month before the stock market crashed. It was the 
lowest price since May, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last year or so there has been a significant retrenching in the 
industry, and that's what we're seeing here," said James J. Maguire, chairman 
of Henderson Brothers Inc., an NYSE member firm. 
</P>
<P>
On the floor of the Big Board -- so named because stock symbols were listed on 
one before the electronic age -- the bid for a seat price Friday was $355,000, 
with an asking price of $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
The price of an NYSE membership has fallen steadily since the 1987 market crash 
after a steady rise that took seats from a low of $35,000 in 1977 to $105,000 
in 1978, $425,000 in 1983 and $600,000 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
At the 1977 nadir, it cost $55,000 for a New York City Taxi and Limousine 
Commission medallion, compared with $135,000 today. 
</P>
<P>
Seats are held by brokerage firms, specialists and individual brokers who trade 
for themselves but seats are registered in one person's name. Non-members must 
pay members to execute trades.

STAINLESS-STEEL TOWER PLANNED FOR COSTA MESA; 
</P>
<P>
ARCHITECTURE: CESAR PELLI'S DESIGN FEATURES A CURVING FACADE AND A COPPERY 
GLOW. THE SEGERSTROM FAMILY AND IBM ARE JOINTLY DEVELOPING THE BUILDING NEAR

COSTA MESA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County will add an unusual new building to its skyline -- which some 
critics have called boring and mundane -- with the addition next year of a 
21-story, stainless steel office tower near South Coast Plaza that was designed 
by renowned architect Cesar Pelli. 
</P>
<P>
Pelli, who recently designed what could become the world's tallest skyscraper 
in Chicago, Tuesday unveiled a model of the new Costa Mesa building, which is 
being jointly developed by the Segerstrom family and IBM Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The design has a curving facade of burnished steel facing inward toward a 
parking garage and walkway on one side. On its other side, the design presents 
a flat surface to passing motorists on Avenue of the Arts. The stainless steel, 
an unusual material for an office tower, is designed to give off a warm, 
coppery glow. 
</P>
<P>
Construction is scheduled to begin in May and be completed in September, 1991. 
While it looks thoroughly modern, the design's details allude to the look of 
older office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Pelli, who lived in Los Angeles in the 1960s and 1970s and designed many 
buildings there, is one of the foremost architects in the nation. He is 
probably best known for designing graceful and daring skyscrapers in big 
cities. This will be his first building in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s and 1980s, the county's cityscape changed, from a low-slung suburb 
of single-family homes and one-story commercial buildings into a series of 
small urban areas where mid-rise office towers of 10 to 15 stories spring up in 
spiky clumps around malls or John Wayne Airport. One of these areas grew up 
around South Coast Plaza, the giant mall that became Costa Mesa's "new 
downtown" and that will be the new building's neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the new county buildings were boxy, glass structures with few 
distinguishing features, a result of the Modernist school of architecture that 
favors sleek, stark buildings with clean lines. These buildings often had the 
advantage of being cheaper to build than more elaborate designs too. 
</P>
<P>
But in the last 20 years or so, such Post-Modernist architects as Pelli have 
experimented with different building materials -- more expensive stuff such as 
granite, for instance -- and more complicated designs that often incorporate 
elements of earlier buildings, such as the soaring, big-city skyscrapers of the 
1920s. 
</P>
<P>
Most of these new buildings, of course, have been built in such cities as New 
York, Los Angeles and Chicago. But lately they have been appearing more 
frequently in such previously undistinguished suburban markets as Orange County 
and Tysons Corner, Va., outside Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the county's architecture has drawn little praise to date. For instance, 
the architecture critic of the New York Times, Paul Goldberger, complained in a 
1988 article that the county's architecture "celebrates not the whimsy of 
Disneyland, but the conformity of glass boxes and other architectural 
banalities." 
</P>
<P>
The county's biggest developers have begun hiring architects such as Pelli to 
design their own buildings for reasons both aesthetic and economic: 
</P>
<P>
* A building with an architectural pedigree is easier to rent to the classy 
tenants that landlords like, especially in an overbuilt office market such as 
Orange County's. 
</P>
<P>
* There are so many office buildings in the county now that a building with a 
distinctive look may be easier to market. 
</P>
<P>
And there are some less tangible benefits: A developer such as the Irvine Co.'s 
Donald L. Bren, for instance, has a vision of how his vast landholdings should 
look and hires the best architects to make it so; there is also some 
civic-mindedness and a healthy dose of ego and one-upmanship involved in hiring 
prominent architects, local realty observers say. 
</P>
<P>
Few developers are quite so blunt as to acknowledge this, though, or to 
criticize each other's buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"This building is a little more daring, a little more creative than we've 
seen," said Henry T. Segerstrom, whose family owns South Coast Plaza and much 
of the land around it. "Orange County is at the stage where we need an 
identity, something very exceptional. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a mediocre community, and we want to elevate our standards of 
design." 
</P>
<P>
Working in the suburbs is often a new experience for such architects as Pelli. 
He said he did not tone down his imaginative ideas for the conservative county, 
although he acknowledged that he might have settled on a different building in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Every building must be part of its environment," Pelli said. "Architecture is 
the art of intelligent and creative response to that environment. But no, we 
didn't tone it down." 
</P>
<P>
Pelli is the latest in a string of renowned architects to work in Orange 
County. Philip Johnson and John Burgee designed TV minister Robert H. 
Schuller's Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove. Helmut Jahn of Chicago is 
designing a small headquarters building in Dana Point for developers David 
Stein and Barry Brief. 
</P>
<P>
Pelli ranks with such glittering names. Born in Argentina 63 years ago, he was 
educated in Argentina and at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He 
worked for several firms in Los Angeles before becoming dean of the School of 
Architecture at Yale University in 1977. He left in 1984. He now designs 
buildings through his firm, Cesar Pelli &amp; Associates in New Haven, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Among the more prominent buildings Pelli has designed are: 
</P>
<P>
* A building that will be the world's tallest if built, just approved for 125 
stories by Chicago's City Council. It is to be 15 stories higher than Chicago's 
Sears Tower, now the world's tallest building. 
</P>
<P>
* The big 777 Tower at Citicorp Plaza in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
* The Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
* The expansion of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. 
</P>
<P>
* The World Financial Center in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
* Norwest Center in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
IBM is a big enough tenant -- especially in a slow office market -- to demand a 
piece of the ownership, so Segerstrom and IBM are partners in the building. 
</P>
<P>
Like Segerstrom, IBM has a history of hiring prestigious architects. In this 
case, the company has a practical objective too: The computer manufacturer is 
the largest tenant in Segerstrom buildings around South Coast Plaza and wanted 
to consolidate its offices and save on rent by building a new tower. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the building was to have been part of Segerstrom's giant Home Ranch 
project a mile or so north of the mall off the San Diego Freeway. But that 
project was killed by Costa Mesa voters. 
</P>
<P>
That building was planned as considerably taller, at 32 stories. The new 
building, much closer to the mall at the northwest corner of Avenue of the Arts 
and Anton Boulevard, would be just 21 stories, because of the proximity of 
flight paths around John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Pelli, who often designs much taller buildings, said he did not feel 
constrained by the relative smallness of the Segerstrom building. It will still 
be one of the tallest buildings in the county. 
</P>
<P>
IBM will occupy the first eight floors or so -- about 160,000 of the 440,000 
square feet -- and Segerstrom will lease the rest to tenants. IBM, unlike many 
big tenants in office buildings, says it does not put a big corporate sign on 
its buildings and will not on this one, saying it prefers not to distract from 
the architecture. 
</P>
<P>
While neither partner will comment, the building is expected to cost at least 
$90 million, based on current construction costs, and probably more because of 
the stainless steel's expense.

GAY LITERATI CELEBRATE NEW ERA OF ACCEPTANCE;

PUBLISHING: THE NUMBER OF BOOKS BY AND ABOUT GAYS IS INCREASING, AS IS THE 
NUMBER OF SPECIALTY BOOK STORES.

<P>
When Mark Thompson was named book editor of The Advocate in 1980, books from 
publishers seeking reviews would trickle in at the rate of three to five a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
A decade later, that trickle has turned into a torrent. "Now, I get three to 
five books every day," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson's workload is just one indication of the explosion in gay literature 
-- books by and about homosexual men and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
Another sign of the boom is the burgeoning number of bookstores catering 
primarily to gays and lesbians: 37 nationwide, compared to seven a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
A Different Light, with stores in Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco, 
stocks 11,000 gay titles, including novels, short stories, biographies, plays, 
histories, self-help books, mysteries and science fiction. The chain carried 
900 gay titles 10 years ago, said Richard Labonte, manager of the San Francisco 
store. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson and Labonte were among the 1,200 gay literati last weekend at OUT 
Write '90, a national conference designed to celebrate and sustain the boom in 
gay publishing. 
</P>
<P>
Those in attendance -- gay and lesbian writers, editors, publishers, 
booksellers, agents, critics, journalists and readers -- participated in two 
days of workshops and discussions on subjects as mundane as finding an agent 
and as weighty as "AIDS and the responsibility of the writer." 
</P>
<P>
"We are here to mark the coming of age of gay and lesbian literature," said 
Jeffrey Escoffier, co-publisher of OUT/LOOK, the national gay and lesbian 
quarterly journal that sponsored the event. 
</P>
<P>
"We are creating a literary infrastructure," added George Stambolian, who 
teaches gay literature at Wellesley College and is the editor of three 
anthologies of gay fiction titled "Men on Men." "We have gay newspapers, 
magazines, reviews, bookstores, readings, awards -- and now conferences." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to this gathering, a daylong symposium on gay literature will be 
held at UCLA on April 21, and Seattle's Alice B. Theatre will be host of a gay 
and lesbian theater conference in July, with activist playwright and novelist 
Larry Kramer ("The Normal Heart," "Reports From the Holocaust") as keynote 
speaker. 
</P>
<P>
Though it remains relatively rare for gay books to cross into the mainstream 
and sell widely to heterosexuals, they increasingly are being taught at 
universities, winning prizes and critical acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Minnie Bruce Pratt, published by the lesbian-owned Firebrand Press, 
won the prestigious Lamont Prize from the Academy of American Poets for her 
collection of poems, "Crime Against Nature." And Yale University's Beinecke 
Rare Book and Manuscript Library has begun to accept the manuscripts, journals 
and letters of important contemporary gay and lesbian writers. 
</P>
<P>
Why this outpouring of gay and lesbian literature? Why didn't it occur in 1969, 
the year usually associated with the beginnings of the modern gay movement, 
when homosexuals rebelled during a police raid of a New York bar called the 
Stonewall Inn? 
</P>
<P>
Because, said OUT/LOOK's Escoffier, "it has taken 20 years for us to . . . 
develop our audience and reach a critical mass." 
</P>
<P>
"This is the literary reflection of an enormous social transformation," said 
Michael Denneny, a founder of Christopher Street magazine and a senior editor 
of St. Martin's Press, where he nurtures a line of gay and lesbian titles. 
"This is what happens when 25 million people stop thinking of themselves as 
sick, sinful or criminally deviant, and begin to affirm themselves and their 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
"There is a desperate urge to define ourselves as a community, and one of the 
ways we are able to do that is through books," added David Groff, a senior 
editor of Crown Books and a founder of the Publishing Triangle, an organization 
for gays and lesbians in the publishing business. 
</P>
<P>
Many point out that the new gay writing is more than self-affirming. At a time 
when AIDS is decimating the ranks of gay men -- 10% of the homosexual men in 
San Francisco have either died of or been found to have fully developed cases 
of AIDS, and another 40% are believed to be infected with the HIV virus -- 
writing has become a means of achieving immortality for writer and subject 
alike. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an incredible need to leave a written record," said John Preston, 
editor of the anthology "Personal Dispatches: Writers Confront AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
"I wish to leave a proper testament of what my people have gone through," added 
Paul Monette, author of "Borrowed Time: An AIDS Memoir," the critically 
acclaimed account of his lover Roger Horwitz's illness and death. "The impulse 
to write the book was very much to leave a record for the future." 
</P>
<P>
If there is an immediacy to their work, it is heightened by the fact that both 
Preston and Monette are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus that is 
thought to cause AIDS. "AIDS is an event we will be spending generations trying 
to know and to define," added Sarah Schulman, a New York writer who derived 
some of the material for her new novel, "People in Trouble," from participating 
in ACT UP, the AIDS activist group. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers believe the epidemic, like past cataclysms, will lead to a whole 
new category of literature. Said Mike Lyons, a Los Angeles playwright: "It is 
like after World War II, when suddenly there was an explosion of books: 'Catch 
22,' 'The Thin Red Line,' 'From Here to Eternity.' " 
</P>
<P>
But today's gay publishing boom encompasses much more than AIDS writing. 
</P>
<P>
There are self-help books for recovering gay and lesbian alcoholics, how-to 
books for lesbian parents, tomes celebrating mythological goddesses, legal 
handbooks for unmarried partners, books on religion and spirituality, erotic 
fiction, and more. In short, conference participants say, the body of work has 
come a long way from the the Angst-ridden coming-out novel of the 1960s and the 
celebratory sex-and-disco novel of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Gay history and biography are also hot. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, details about people's sexuality were left out -- often with the 
best of intentions," said Stuart Timmons, who is finishing a biography of Harry 
Hay, the father of gay liberation. "Being gay was considered a secret and a 
liability." 
</P>
<P>
But the presumption of heterosexuality also had the effect of robbing gay 
people of their heroes. That is changing. Consider Alan Berube's "Coming Out 
Under Fire: The History of Gay Men and Women in World War Two." 
</P>
<P>
Calling it "the definitive work on gay heroes and heroines of World War II," 
writer Studs Terkel wrote: "Their gallantry was in bold contrast to the 
cravenness of their detractors." 
</P>
<P>
The gay book market has been developed by small gay-owned and -operated presses 
as well as publishing industry giants. In recent years, St. Martin's, Crown, 
Harper &amp; Row, and New American have established large gay book lists. Some 
of their authors were first published by small gay presses. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the role of the small press, by its very nature, is to discover and 
nurture new writers, and to see them move on," said Alyson, who recently lost 
Los Angeles gay mystery writer Michael Nava to Harper &amp; Row. 
</P>
<P>
"You may as well complain about the sun rising." 
</P>
<P>
Small presses such as Firebrand, Naiad, Seal, and Woman in the Moon are an 
especially important influence in lesbian publishing. Some have roots in the 
feminist publishing houses that grew up in the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
"These publishing endeavors came out of a sense that we had to have this kind 
of material, and that it didn't exist anyplace else," said Nancy K. Bereano, 
editor and publisher of Firebrand. 
</P>
<P>
Publishers large and small said they are able to make a nice profit on gay 
books, even those with relatively low circulation. "Our blockbuster -- our 
biggest crossover book by far -- was 'And The Band Played On' by (gay 
journalist) Randy Shilts," said Denneny of St. Martin's. 
</P>
<P>
The critically acclaimed expose of federal inaction and scientific bickering 
during the early years of the AIDS epidemic made bestseller lists and sold 
150,000 copies in hardcover. 
</P>
<P>
"But we have also found a way to make a neat little profit from small print 
runs. Our overhead is such that we can make a profit selling just 3,500 copies 
of a book." 
</P>
<P>
Crown, on the other hand, tries to buy rights to books that it thinks will sell 
at least 10,000 copies. "We need to develop the crossover market," said Crown's 
Groff. "And we need to develop a bigger audience among gay men and lesbians." 
</P>
<P>
One way to develop the market, participants agreed, is to persuade more 
colleges and universities to offer courses on gay and lesbian literature, 
culture and history. 
</P>
<P>
Groff said that, despite considerable progress, gay and lesbian authors still 
sometimes encounter condescending attitudes from society's cultural arbiters. 
As an example, he cited the generally favorable review of Paul Monette's new 
novel about AIDS widowers called "Afterlife," in last Sunday's New York Times 
Book Review. 
</P>
<P>
Monette "wants to go beyond Gay Lit and invite us all in," reviewer Judith 
Viorst wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Said Groff: "Can you imagine a reviewer saying that Alice Walker, in 'The Color 
Purple,' wants us to go beyond the plantation experience?"

FINANCES: BANKS DESIGN NEW, LOW-MINIMUM SAVINGS PLANS FOR PEOPLE WHO LACK THE 
WILLPOWER TO PUT AWAY MONEY.

Like most Americans, Michael Polk is not a great saver. In the 2 1/2 years he 
has lived in Los Angeles, he has had only a checking account. But now, he has 
found a new way to force himself to put money away. 
</P>
<P>
Polk, a 31-year-old actor and property manager, just signed up for California 
Federal Bank's Automatic Saving and Planning Account, a custom plan that 
deducts predetermined sums from his checking account and deposits them in a 
four-month certificate of deposit earning 8.17% interest. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers can open the accounts with a minimum of $200 and order monthly 
transfers of $25 or more from their checking account to a money market account; 
a four-month, fixed-rate CD, or a one-year, variable-rate CD. The plan allows 
them to increase the amount of the transfer and to miss two monthly payments 
per year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not very good at keeping track of money," Polk said. "But I need to have a 
little cushion. This way, I put the money in my checking account, they take out 
$50 every two weeks . . . and I don't have to think about it. This kind of plan 
is good for people who don't work for a big corporation with a credit union. . 
. . They take the money out and you don't see it." 
</P>
<P>
With its ASAP program, California Federal has joined the growing number of 
banks nationwide developing new ways for consumers to save, said Virginia 
Stafford of the American Bankers Assn. in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"More and more banks are offering variations on savings accounts, alternative 
savings with high yield," she said. "We've seen more creativity these days on 
the part of banks in designing accounts that help promote savings. The 
automatic transfers are an out-of-sight, out-of-mind approach. These more 
creative accounts help provide consumers with a little extra influence to 
save." 
</P>
<P>
Americans, Stafford said, are among the worst savers in the world. The U.S. 
household savings rate dropped from 5% in 1980 to 2 1/2% in 1987 but rose again 
in late 1989 to 5.8%. 
</P>
<P>
But that's minuscule compared to other nations: Japan's rate, for example, is 
20%; Germany's is 13.9%; France's is 13%, and Canada's is 11%. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been an overall concern about the nation's low savings rate," because 
it generally means that Americans are taking on more debt and have less money 
to invest in their future, Stafford said. "The banks that do this (help 
consumers save) should be commended for encouraging the consumer to take a 
long-term approach." 
</P>
<P>
In developing its savings program, CalFed spent almost a year consulting with 
consumers. "Our (numerous) focus groups of 10 people, ages 30 to 49, said they 
needed to save, but they don't have ways . . . " said Laura S. Kalb, CalFed 
vice president and director of deposit product management. "They wanted a low 
minimum and wanted to have a skip available in the program, in case there were 
times when they needed their money." 
</P>
<P>
In the three weeks since it started the program, CalFed has opened 8,000 ASAP 
accounts, a number CalFed President William L. Callender calls "phenomenal." 
"It's proof that a program such as this was sorely needed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There are other familiar ways to save. Some silly people keep their rainy-day 
funds in cookie jars or under mattresses (not recommended). Others stash cash 
through payroll-deduction plans that invest in U.S. savings bonds. Or they set 
up their own plan, putting their savings in bonds and U.S. Treasury bills. Many 
frugal folk also use work-related savings and retirement programs, such as 
401(k)s. 
</P>
<P>
And for 60.4 million Americans -- 7 million in California -- there are, of 
course, workplace credit unions. 
</P>
<P>
Credit unions offer various savings options, including traditional savings 
accounts, variable-rate CDs and Christmas club plans. "Different credit unions 
have different options, depending on how they're set up," said Tina Lozano of 
the California Credit Union League in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
But are banks now simply imitating credit unions with their new savings 
programs? 
</P>
<P>
"Banks," said Jerry Karbon of the Madison, Wis.-based Credit Union National 
Assn., "are becoming somewhat envious of what credit unions have been doing and 
are trying to offer similar services." 
</P>
<P>
Most banks and savings institutions require a minimum of $500 or $1,000 to open 
a CD, but Kalb of CalFed said the bank decided to lower its minimum for its new 
savings account to $200 "to help more people save. "The people we're trying to 
attract don't have $1,000, or have it tied up in other things. They can be 
either poor people or upscale." 
</P>
<P>
CalFed studies showed that both the poor and the wealthy maintained savings 
"well below the minimums required by various financial institutions to open 
investment accounts -- including CDs, mutual funds and money-market accounts." 
</P>
<P>
More than half of the high-income workers -- in the $40,000 to $130,000 bracket 
-- ages 35 to 49 said that they were unable to save. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, few Americans, regardless of age, have put away the minimum that 
banking and credit experts recommend: the equivalent of three months' salary. 
</P>
<P>
And few adhere to the yearly savings plan recommended by experts for various 
age groups: Save or invest 5% of pretax income from 30 to 40; from 40 to 45, 
increase that amount by 1% a year, after 45, save 10% yearly. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're in your 50s, you should eliminate your debt and put away 20% of your 
salary," advised Michael Sullivan, a banking consultant from Charlotte, N.C.

DESIGNERS COME UP SHORT IN BERMUDAS AND SKIRTS FOR 1990

If Gianni Versace was bold enough last season to hike his hemlines 10 inches 
above the knee, he's downright aggressive now, with skirts so tiny they hardly 
cover the wearer's hips. 
</P>
<P>
In his fall '90 collection, shown on Sunday, the flamboyant designer and 
favorite son of the show-biz crowd presented a variety of abbreviated items, 
from derriere-hugging jersey dresses and skirts to elaborately embroidered silk 
cocktail mini-gowns. 
</P>
<P>
For a long evening, Versace showed a floor-length dress, but it was slit 
straight up the leg with a plunging back line that met the slit at the waist. 
There, the dress was held together with a single snap. What happens if the snap 
pops is anybody's guess. 
</P>
<P>
There were more than a few raised eyebrows from the crowd on this first day of 
the four-day ready-to-wear collections, and afterward the consensus seemed to 
be that Versace's short skirts were just too short. 
</P>
<P>
The jeweled embroidery on some of his evening wear helped divert attention from 
the many bare spots in any given outfit. A tiny, A-line slip-dress became a 
sumptuous cocktail gown when covered with myriad shimmering crystals and pearls 
that formed a heart on the the bodice. 
</P>
<P>
Bustiers made entirely of encrusted jewels gave substance to the micro-mini 
below, while simple silk stretch pants turned into sophisticated evening wear 
when decorated with paisley tops covered with sequins. 
</P>
<P>
The newest looking jacket by Versace is loose and full with wide sleeves and 
generous shawl collar, in bright shades of blue, green, yellow and red -- a 
favorite color of the designer this season. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday as well, Giorgio Armani showed his Emporio Armani collection, aimed 
at the younger set. It was filled with fun ideas for the chilly winter months. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy knit sweaters were shown over jackets, boots reached the thigh to protect 
legs bared by miniskirts and Bermuda shorts, and jumpsuits were worn with a 
scarf tied around the waist for extra coziness. 
</P>
<P>
These first two shows have been followed by others that reconfirm Italian 
designers' commitment to skirts a good 3 inches above the knee, and Bermuda as 
well as short shorts, for winter 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The shorts are loose-fitting and sporty, usually made of corduroy or light wool 
jersey, worn with dark or printed stockings and comfortable walking shoes. Like 
most of the "moda Milanese" seen this season, the look is pert rather than 
sexy. 
</P>
<P>
Gone are the tailored city suits and elegant coats of past seasons, replaced by 
sweat suits, sport jackets, parkas, down and duffel coats and loads of knitwear 
from cozy cardigans, pullovers and sweater dresses to the brand-new all-knit 
jumpsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Colors range from the browns and reds of autumn leaves to the icy beige, green 
and blue pastel shades of a winter landscape. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the collections shown on Monday -- Krizia, Missoni and Byblos -- are 
longtime experts in the field of chic sportswear. 
</P>
<P>
Krizia, by Mariuccia Mandelli, featured a soft and casual look with natural 
shoulder lines, brief hemlines and loose-fitted waistlines. Jackets tended to 
be oversized with huge shawl collars, rounded hemline and drawstring waist. 
Krizia also offered cozy bathrobe coats with silk cord monk belts. 
</P>
<P>
For weekend wear, Krizia showed a series of quilted items from long down coats 
and duffel coats to pert quilted miniskirts. 
</P>
<P>
Most seasons Krizia makes use of a jungle-animal motif to adorn pullovers and 
sweaters. But for next winter the designer steals cherubs from a Renaissance 
painting and prints them on her soft cashmere pullovers and short sweater 
dresses. White horses and imperial eagles also adorn many of her outfits. 
</P>
<P>
To dress up her sporty look, Krizia's Mandelli embroidered gold onto lapels, 
hemlines and cuffs. 
</P>
<P>
Since last winter, the Italian designers have promoted the anti-fur movement by 
replacing their once-sumptuous furs with exquisite look-alikes in teddy-bear 
plush. Thus the Krizia customer can flaunt her tiger, leopard or brightly dyed 
beaver outerwear, knowing its all just fluff. 
</P>
<P>
Missoni has been the leading label for Italian knitwear ever since the company 
presented reversible knit and quilted jackets, several decades ago. But the 
latest collection, entirely dedicated to the Soviet Union, is one of the best 
in seasons.

Beautiful reversible coats and parkas are knitted in patterns of Russian folk 
art: the "onion" spires of Red Square, the quaint houses of a Russian village, 
the geometric designs of a carpet. The same patterns appear on knitted 
jumpsuits and sweat pants, as well as silk evening outfits.

Later in the day on Monday, Keith Varty and Alan Cleaver for Byblos presented 
their version of the sporty winter woman. 
</P>
<P>
True to their British blood, the designers dressed her in favorite items from 
their native countryside: riding jackets with velvet collars, riding breeches, 
and blouses complete with ascot tie. Lace embroidery added a feminine touch to 
the look. 
</P>
<P>
For languid hours by the fire of a ski lodge, Byblos offered heavy knit 
pullovers in ivory-white with large rose patterns, and cable-knit Irish 
sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of skiing, the Byblos ski parkas with string-tie and fur-trimmed hood 
in icy beige or blue are sure to be a hot item on the slopes from Aspen to St. 
Moritz.

2 LIVE CREW'S 'NASTY LYRICS' A BUM RAP?; 
</P>
<P>
THE LAW: POLITICS AND PRURIENCE MIX IN FLORIDA'S REACTION TO 2 LIVE CREW'S 
ALBUM 'AS NASTY AS THEY WANNA BE.'

Florida's state prosecutor said Tuesday he will not proceed with a 
controversial investigation related to an album by a Miami rap group. But the 
prosecutor left open the door to local authorities wishing to file criminal 
racketeering and obscenity charges against the group's record company and 
retailers. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide Prosecutor Peter Antonacci's move is the latest chapter in a 
continuing and closely watched dispute in the state over the alleged sales to 
minors of the expletive-laced 2 Live Crew album "As Nasty as They Wanna Be." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Republican Gov. Bob Martinez ordered Antonacci's office to 
investigate complaints about the album. The prosecutor's action on Tuesday 
essentially takes his office out of the matter, but leaves unresolved some of 
the governor's basic concerns about the album. 
</P>
<P>
"This office does not have the jurisdiction to bring individual obscenity 
charges," said prosecutor Antonacci in a telephone interview from his 
Tallahassee office, "and we have chosen to refer these complaints to local 
prosecutors." 
</P>
<P>
The Florida case is of particular interest to the record industry, which is 
facing a variety of album content challenges across the country, because it 
involves possible criminal charges against the rap group's record company as 
well as retailers who sell the album. 
</P>
<P>
Concern over explicit lyrics in popular music has spawned warning label 
proposals by legislators in six states, including Florida, with at least 15 
other states considering similar measures. 
</P>
<P>
But the 2 Live Crew matter has received especially widespread attention from 
outside the state, and it has even become an issue in this year's Florida 
governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Arpel, director of government affairs for the New Jersey-based National 
Association of Recording Merchandisers, called the investigation an abuse of 
government clout. 
</P>
<P>
"There are 43 laws around the country similar to Florida's obscenity statute," 
Arpel said. "But . . . there's never been a single pop music sound recording 
found to be obscene. But when government officials start rattling their sabers, 
it creates a chill and scares off store owners who have a legal right to carry 
(explicit) product." 
</P>
<P>
The Florida case began early this year with a complaint from a conservative 
Miami lawyer but took on its much broader political importance nearly three 
weeks ago with a letter from Martinez to Antonacci, a Democrat, blasting 2 Live 
Crew's music as "vulgar" and "disgusting." 
</P>
<P>
The governor suggested that the album failed to meet accepted standards of 
"legitimate public expression protected by the First Amendment." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez's letter noted that "a pattern of racketeering is arguably present" 
and that Skyywalker Records, 2 Live Crew's label, could possibly be targeted 
for prosecution as "an enterprise within the scope of RICO," the Racketeer 
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. 
</P>
<P>
Under Florida law, the sale of sound recordings depicting "sexual excitement or 
activity" to minors is considered a felony. Retailers found guilty of selling 
"obscene" records to anyone under 18 could face penalties of up to five years 
in jail for each individual sale and/or $5,000 in fines. The law also states 
that sale of such recordings to adults is a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
The governor cited a recent obscenity ruling issued against 2 Live Crew by a 
judge in Lee County (Ft. Myers) and a Dade County (Miami) investigation into 
the possible sale of the "Nasty" album to minors. 
</P>
<P>
Often criticized as misogynistic, 2 Live Crew's songs frequently describe 
violent sexual acts involving oral copulation, sadism, masochism and sodomy. 
</P>
<P>
The 2 Live Crew case has become a campaign issue in this year's Florida 
governor's race. Martinez is facing a 30%-40% negative rating in statewide 
polls, and, some critics say, he is using the album issue to drum up further 
support among conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Neal, senior vice president of legal affairs at the Washington-based 
Recording Industry Assn. of America, which represents the nation's major record 
companies, says her organization has been monitoring the progress of the 
investigation very closely. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes when your political chips are down, you try to come up with whatever 
you can. Even free speech can go out the window," Neal said. "The fact that the 
statewide prosecutor failed to act upon this case underscores our feeling that 
the events surrounding the probe were politically motivated." 
</P>
<P>
"I respect the governor and wish him the best of luck," said 2 Live Crew 
lyricist Mark Ross. "But I just wish that he didn't have to use 2 Live Crew to 
get reelected." 
</P>
<P>
But Mark Silva, a political writer for the Miami Herald, suggests that the 
governor has little to gain by exploiting the 2 Live Crew controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see it as a political ploy because the voters that this 'nasty lyric' 
investigation might appeal to are already in his camp," Silva said. "I think 
it's more of a moral issue for him. He is a devout Catholic, a fervent 
anti-abortionist, and this seems to be a matter of personal moral conviction 
for him." 
</P>
<P>
"As Nasty as They Wanna Be" has sold more than 1.2 million copies, and after 33 
weeks is holding steady at No. 35 on Billboard's pop chart and No. 40 on the 
black chart. Although a sanitized version of the record titled "As Clean as 
They Wanna Be" is also available, the sexually explicit album outsells it nine 
to one, according to the record company. 
</P>
<P>
Luke Skyywalker Records, 2 Live Crew's Miami-based record company abides by a 
warning label agreement established in 1985 between the record industry and the 
Parents Music Resource Center, labeling its product with a sticker that warns 
of explicit lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
Skyywalker President Luther Campbell also sent a letter to retailers Feb. 23 
offering to provide stores an additional sticker that reads: "Warning: Explicit 
language contained. Parental discretion advised. 18 and older only." 
</P>
<P>
The current controversy surrounding 2 Live Crew began on New Year's Day when 
Coral Gables attorney Jack Thompson sent letters to both the governor and Dade 
County State Attorney Janet Reno, requesting an investigation into the possible 
violation of state obscenity statutes regarding the rap group's album. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, a 38-year-old Sunday school teacher who ran unsuccessfully as Reno's 
Republican opponent in Dade County's last election, initiated his crusade after 
reading a transcription of the group's sexually explicit lyrics given to him by 
a member of the Rev. Donald Wildmon's Tupelo, Miss.-based media watchdog 
organization the American Family Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Dissatisfied with the lack of response from the state attorney's office, 
Thompson arranged a private purchase on Jan. 17, in which he alleged that three 
separate retailers in Dade County sold the 2 Live Crew's "Nasty" tape to a 
16-year-old. State Attorney Reno told The Times that her office is reviewing 
the evidence regarding the alleged sales to minors in her district. 
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, Spec's music chain instituted a 52-store policy banning 
the sale of records with warning labels to anyone under 18. Shortly thereafter, 
Spec's parent company, the Albany, N.Y.-based Trans World Corp. also enacted an 
18-to-purchase rule for its 450 outlets on the East Coast. The Hialeah Gardens, 
Fla.-based Peaches chain has removed the album from its 22 stores. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 1, Thompson sent a copy of 2 Live Crew's lyrics to the Lee County 
sheriff's department. He also sent a letter to the state attorney in Lee 
County, who, based on a prior obscenity ruling in the 20th Judicial District, 
had 14 months earlier banned 2 Live Crew's 1988 recording "Move Something" from 
store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 9, Lee County Judge Isaac Anderson ruled that there was "probable cause 
to believe" that "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" was an obscene recording. Armed 
with a copy of the judge's obscenity order, police visited or phoned every 
record shop in the county, advising store owners of the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Bob Maycomber, chief deputy and head of the Lee County Sheriff Department's 
narcotics and vice section, told The Times that local retailers cooperated with 
police, voluntarily removing the product from their shelves. Luke Skyywalker 
Records has not contested the judge's ruling in court. 
</P>
<P>
Broadening the scope of his attack on Feb. 12, Thompson sent copies of the 2 
Live Crew lyrics to 67 more sheriff departments. 
</P>
<P>
A letter written by Thompson persuaded the sheriff's department in Seminole 
County to conduct its own 2 Live Crew tape-buying operation on Feb. 20. 
Industry observers expect a similar obscenity order to be handed down against 
the "Nasty" record in Seminole County before the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
In Lake County, police contacted by Thompson are also moving to block the sale 
of N.W.A's critically acclaimed "Straight Outta Compton" rap record. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson sent a letter to the Governor on Tuesday urging him to appoint a 
special prosecutor to carry on the state investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Luther Campbell and 2 Live Crew are pornographers. It's as simple as 
that," said Thompson from his Coral Gables home. "I will not give up until I 
put them out of business."

SOME OFFICIALS DUBIOUS ON AID TO ARTS; 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: SEVERAL SUPERVISORS REACT DOUBTFULLY ON PROPOSAL TO HELP SUPPORT 
COUNTYWIDE ARTS SERVICE ORGANIZATION BUT TAKE A WAIT-AND-SEE POSITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Some members of the Orange County Board of Supervisors sounded a somewhat 
dubious but familiar note Tuesday about prospects of funding a proposed 
countywide arts service organization, which made its recommendations public a 
day earlier. But top county officials also say it is premature to assess those 
recommendations fully. 
</P>
<P>
The ad-hoc Committee to Form an Orange County Arts Council, which delivered its 
recommendations to supervisors last week, is proposing that the county 
contribute $125,000 "in cash and/or in-kind services" toward a $285,200 
first-year budget for the agency. Other money would come from the state and 
federal government and the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
The county, now one of only two in the state without an arts service agency, 
has been without one since 1988, when the 14-year-old Orange County Arts 
Alliance dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
County supervisors contacted this week said they want to reserve final comment 
on the recommendations until the County Administrative Office evaluates them. 
That office, at Supervisor Thomas F. Riley's request, is studying the county's 
role in arts support and is reviewing the committee's recommendations as part 
of the report, Riley said. The study is to be completed April 2. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not much to talk about," Riley said. Asked if it was likely that the 
county, whose support of the arts historically has been close to nil, would 
fund the proposed agency, he said, "I don't want to discourage anybody . . . 
but I don't believe the Board of Supervisors' past performance certainly has 
indicated that (the arts have) a higher priority than the homeless or some 
other projects. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really not sure how much support there is today when money for (social) 
programs is such a difficult thing to find," Riley said, repeating a position 
he has espoused in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez also spoke of competition for county dollars. "I'm 
not closed to evaluating merits of (the committee's) proposal . . . but 
$125,000 is a significant request in the face of other budgetary demands we 
have. It will have to compete with other priorities for county services." 
</P>
<P>
The 27-member committee composed of arts and community officials is 
recommending that the council be established by July 1 and that it develop ways 
to substantially increase local funding and arts education, draft a long-term 
strategic cultural plan, be designated by the county as a "state-local 
partner," its official arts representative to the state, and serve other needs. 
</P>
<P>
Committee officials have stressed that county support is critical to the new 
agency's survival. 
</P>
<P>
But Charles Desmarais, committee president and director of the Laguna Art 
Museum, said Tuesday that the recommendations are "suggestions only," and that 
he'd "rather not concentrate too much" on the committee's proposed budget. The 
committee would welcome any ways the county could help meet the needs of the 
arts community as outlined in the committee's recommendations. The list of 
needs is based largely on information gathered last year during committee 
meetings attended by more than 175 local arts officials. 
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that sources of funds could be identified that wouldn't be in 
direct competition with money for the homeless, etc.," Desmarais said. But "if 
the basic needs we've outlined can be met with half as much money, that's 
wonderful. We'd enthusiastically support any alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
According to Gloria Woodlock, manager of the state program for county arts 
agencies, most of these 56 "state-local partners," even in "rural and 
economically depressed areas," receive some county funding. The committee has 
applied for $12,500 from the California Arts Council, money it could receive 
only if designated by the county as a "state-local partner." 
</P>
<P>
Woodlock also said that $285,200 to launch the proposed agency is a "good 
start." But, she added, "in a community the size of Orange County, they'll have 
to find additional funding to be able to accomplish anything."

DEDICATION FUELED BALLET DANCER'S LEAP TO FAME; 
</P>
<P>
PERFORMANCE: JULIO BOCCA, YOUNGEST PRINCIPAL DANCER IN AMERICAN BALLET THEATRE 
HISTORY, SAYS ALL HE EVER WANTED TO DO IS DANCE. THIS WEEK HE AND THE ABT 
PERFORM IN COSTA MESA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
At the unprecedented age of 19, Julio Bocca became a principal dancer with 
American Ballet Theatre in 1986, the youngest principal ABT ever had. How did 
the Argentine youngster do it? 
</P>
<P>
Winning the gold medal at the Fifth International Ballet Competition in Moscow 
in 1985 certainly helped. But it was more the result of Bocca's longtime 
single-minded dedication to establishing a dance career. 
</P>
<P>
"I went only for seven years to school, then I stopped," Bocca said recently 
from Miami, where he was staying with friends before heading to Costa Mesa for 
his appearances this week with ABT at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pretty determined to be a dancer," said Bocca, who was born in Buenos 
Aires and turned 23 on Tuesday. He started his dance training with his mother 
when he was 4. 
</P>
<P>
He went on to study at the National Ballet school at the Teatro Colon, joined 
the International Ballet of Caracas at 15 and became a principal dancer with 
Teatro Colon at 17. 
</P>
<P>
Bocca studied and coached with dancers from the Ballets Russes, from whom he 
imbibed a respect for classical line and a deep love of classical roles. 
</P>
<P>
Was it hard for a young man to study ballet in a country dominated by machismo? 
</P>
<P>
"If someone said something to me, I didn't care," he said. "It was their 
problem, not mine." 
</P>
<P>
His meteoric rise to fame occurred after he won the gold medal for dancing four 
virtuosic pas de deux, including "Corsaire," "Don Quixote," "Nutcracker" and 
"Tango" (created by Argentine choreographer Gustavo Molajoli). 
</P>
<P>
But winning not only changed his life -- he talked of one performance before 
100,000 people in Buenos Aires -- it raised the dance consciousness of his 
compatriots. 
</P>
<P>
"After the competition, we had this dance explosion in Argentina," he said. 
"The same thing happened with tennis player Guillermo Vilas. No one played 
tennis before he was a star. Now tennis is fine -- everyone plays. That has 
happened now with ballet. There's a big difference now. Now they have someone 
to see and admire. Now, ballet is for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
International companies came calling too. American Ballet Theatre invited him 
to join the New York company as a principal dancer. His first ballet with ABT 
was the "Nutcracker," followed by the full-length "Don Quixote." During the 
past two years, Orange County and Los Angeles audiences have seen him in "Don 
Quixote" pas de deux, the "Nutcracker," "The Sleeping Beauty" and "Etudes." He 
said he has done all the classical roles with ABT except "Swan Lake." 
</P>
<P>
In these ballets, he has often been partnered with Cheryl Yeager. 
</P>
<P>
"Cheryl was so incredibly nice to me from the beginning," Bocca said. "It was 
my first year in the United States as a principal dancer, when other people 
have to work maybe 10 years to be a principal. . . . She would try to 
understand me and try to explain things to me. She was incredible." 
</P>
<P>
It was for them that former ABT artistic associate Twyla Tharp choreographed 
her newest work, "Brief Fling," which received its premiere last week in San 
Francisco. The two will dance it in Orange County on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the classical roles more than the other things," Bocca admitted. "But 
sometimes, you have to do other things so you can be better and grow up, right? 
When you have this possibility to do a new ballet from Twyla Tharp, I do it and 
enjoy it. I also have a new ballet for me by Roland Petite. . . . But at this 
point, for me, I am interested mostly in the classical roles, just to keep 
growing in the classical roles." 
</P>
<P>
Bocca also will dance Romeo opposite the Juliet of Alessandra Ferri on Friday 
and Sunday afternoon, and Balanchine's "Theme and Variations" with Yeager on 
March 16. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Romeo' is great," he said. "I love to do it. You just enjoy it, listen to 
the music, be sexy with your partner. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
What about Balanchine's "Theme and Variations"? 
</P>
<P>
"That's hard, definitely hard, it has so many steps," he said. "It's one of the 
most difficult ballets, technically. . . . You have to be secure, keyed in, 
like nothing is happening, and also, you can't do a lot of emotional explosion 
because it's not like that, not like the 'Don Quixote' pas de deux. There you 
are very free to do whatever you want. This is so compact, very clean, perfect, 
quiet. It's so difficult." 
</P>
<P>
He recalled ABT's former artistic director Mikhail Baryshnikov saying to him, 
"If you can do a good 'Theme and Variations,' you can do a good everything 
else." 
</P>
<P>
Bocca has been trying to do "a good everything else" both in and outside the 
United States. In 1988, he joined the Royal Danish Ballet as a guest artist for 
two months, and more recently also danced with Natalia Makarova in "Romeo and 
Juliet" for the Royal Ballet in Great Britain, as well as with the Bolshoi and 
the Kirov ballets in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
After all that, how does the ABT experience stack up? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to compare one company or one dancer to another one," Bocca said. 
"I enjoy dancing, I love dancing. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy with the people in the company," he said. "Sometimes, you want to go 
into a large company, you go work and that's it. The point for me is to try to 
make a good relationship with all the company." 
</P>
<P>
But Bocca does miss his home in Argentina, which he visits as often as ABT's 
schedule permits. 
</P>
<P>
"In New York, when maybe I have two days off, I fly back just to be there even 
for a couple of hours," he said. "I have all my best friends, my family, my 
house, my dog there." 
</P>
<P>
Although he appears slightly self-conscious about his accent, Bocca has no 
trouble expressing himself in English. 
</P>
<P>
"My first year, I still had a little problem with English. Now, it's just 
fine," he said. "I can say something terrible to everyone. I know all the bad 
words." 
</P>
<P>
 American Ballet Theatre principal dancer Julio Bocca will dance Twyla Tharp's 
new "Brief Fling" with Cheryl Yeager at 8 p.m. Thursday at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, in Costa Mesa. Bocca also is 
scheduled to dance Romeo opposite the Juliet of Alessandra Ferri in MacMillan's 
"Romeo and Juliet" at 8 p.m. Friday and at 2 p.m. Sunday; Balanchine's "Theme 
and Variations" at 8 p.m. March 16; "Brief Fling" at 8 p.m. March 17, and "La 
Bayadere" Act II at 8 p.m. March 18. Tickets: $10-$40 for mixed repertory 
programs; $16-$47 for "Romeo and Juliet." Information: (714) 556-2787.

Ballet Pacifica of Laguna Beach will represent the Pacific region at the Fourth 
International Ballet Competition on June 29 in Jackson, Miss. The 28-year-old 
troupe will dance Norbert Vesak's "Gift to Be Single," set to traditional 
Shaker hymns, on a bill with four other regional dance companies -- the Central 
Pennsylvania Youth Ballet, Fort Wayne Ballet, Augusta Ballet and Dallas 
Metropolitan Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
The International Ballet Competition was founded in Varna, Bulgaria, in 1964 
and is considered one of the most prestigious competitions in dance. It is held 
every four years, rotating between Varna, Helsinki, Moscow and Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
The Hoag Foundation of Los Angeles has given $5,000 to Opera Pacific to help 
fund outreach programs for mentally handicapped children in seven Orange County 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
The schools, to be visited by Opera Pacific's Overture Company between April 17 
and June 19, are: the Adams School in Santa Ana; Canyon Hills TMR in Anaheim; 
Currie Middle School in Tustin; Esperanza Special Education in Mission Viejo; 
Hope School in Buena Park; Huntington Beach Guidance Center, and the Marion 
Parsons Special Education school in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The grant is the foundation's first to Opera Pacific's special education 
program, which is in its third year. Earlier funding had been provided by Very 
Special Arts National, Opera America, and local organizations.

SANTA BARBARA FILM FESTIVAL: MODEST BUT COMING OF AGE; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: A SOLID AND VARIED FILM LINEUP, SCENIC OCEAN SETTING AND A VARIETY OF 
ATTRACTIONS OFFER A REGIONAL PARADISE FOR FILM BUFFS.

Compared to the programs of the long-established festivals in Cannes, New York 
and Toronto, the Santa Barbara International Film Festival is strictly junior 
varsity. But when it comes to setting, movie-going convenience and 
organizational good will, you need go no further. This 5-year-old festival, 
almost contained on beautiful State Street just blocks from the Pacific Ocean, 
is becoming a regional paradise for film fans. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-day event, which opened Friday with a screening of Coline Serreau's 
"Mama, There's a Man in Your Bed" at the 65-year-old Granada movie palace, 
includes the showing of 80 movies at 15 downtown theaters, plus a dozen special 
events at which both local and imported film makers and stars rub elbows with 
moviegoers. 
</P>
<P>
Out-of-towners who reserved rooms off State Street before the hotels sold out 
need comfortable shoes, a good attitude and nothing else; the theaters are all 
within walking distance, with restaurants, art galleries and other amiable 
distractions in between. The organizers have used every available space for 
their non-film attractions, even taking over the fine old Bank of Montecito for 
the opening night party. 
</P>
<P>
But the future of any festival is built on the strength of its film schedule 
and for all its local popularity, Santa Barbara has gotten off to a very modest 
start. Previous programs have been heavy on easily arranged retrospectives and 
other festivals' leftovers and light on premieres and themes of substance. As a 
result, it hasn't made many serious film buffs' festival "must" list. 
</P>
<P>
And while the town's celebrity residents have lent support to the festival, 
it's been hard for the organizers to get many of them to actually participate. 
Santa Barbaran Jane Seymour, who introduced Serreau's film to the opening night 
audience, said this is the first year she has been in town when the festival 
was under way. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Santa Barbara festival is showing perceptible growth in its 
programming and 16 of the 25 opening weekend events this year were sold out, 
marking a 100% increase over 1989's festival. Festival publicity director 
Sheila Barr said that merchants reported twice as much revenue over last year's 
opening weekend and most hotels and motels had no vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
Opening night ticket-holders were not disappointed. Serreau's "Mama, There's a 
Man in Your Bed," a funny, romantic story about a Paris yogurt mogul (Daniel 
Auteuil) whose shattered career is rebuilt with the help his company's 
graveyard-shift cleaning woman (Firmine Richard, was a huge hit, as were 
Auteuil and Serreau at the post-screening party. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's hottest ticket was Chuck Workman's new documentary "Superstar: The 
Life and Times of Andy Warhol," but the sleepers were Nick Broomfield's 
"Diamond Skulls" and Mike Hodges' "Black Rainbow." All three films were having 
their U.S. premieres. 
</P>
<P>
With his passion for monosyllabic answers, Andy Warhol was an interviewer's 
nightmare who deliberately cultivated a passive, enigmatic image. Workman, 
whose exhilarating tribute to the movies, "Precious Images," won him an Academy 
Award a few years ago, interviewed countless people, but Warhol's essence -- if 
he had one -- seems to have eluded the film maker. Neither family nor friends, 
including longtime Warhol associates Viva and Gerard Malanga , give us a clear 
idea of what the man was really like. 
</P>
<P>
"Diamond Skulls," which marks the fictional feature debut of Broomfield, a 
noted documentarian, is a steamy, stylish account of an English nobleman 
(Gabriel Byrne) whose intense jealousy over his devoted but dazzlingly sexy 
wife (Amanda Donohoe) becomes the basis for a chilling commentary on a ruling 
class hypocritically willing to close ranks in the face of a needless killing. 
</P>
<P>
At a party after the screening, Broomfield acknowledged that his film was 
inspired, though not in its plot, by the notorious Lord Lucan incident, adding 
that he did not want his film to be "spot on" for fear of lawsuits. Ironically, 
not five minutes later -- and not five feet away -- Jeffrey Taylor, 
co-executive producer of "A Handful of Dust," remarked that he has a film about 
Lucan on his schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the all-out experimental, the festival, under artistic director 
Phyllis de Picciotto, does offer a considerable range of films. 
</P>
<P>
Although out-of-towners may have trouble finding a place to stay, there's still 
plenty to see, especially during the festival's concluding weekend, which 
brings the hilarious romantic comedy "The Tall Guy" with Jeff Goldblum and Emma 
Thompson and the world premiere of John Waters' latest, "Cry Baby,".

3 OF 5 DIRECTORS RESIGN IN EMULEX CORP. SHAKE-UP; 
</P>
<P>
PERSONNEL: THE COMPUTER PRODUCTS FIRM'S SAGGING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DID NOT 
INFLUENCE THE CHANGES, AN OUTGOING BOARD MEMBER SAYS.

<P>
In a boardroom shake-up, Emulex Corp. said Tuesday that three of its five 
directors have resigned voluntarily. The computer products company named 
replacements for two of the positions, with a third director to be named later. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall A. Petersen, senior vice president for finance and administration, 
said Emulex wants "to get a very active board that participates in our industry 
and to get a board that has a totally outside membership." Petersen is one of 
the three resigning directors, though he will remain as senior vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Also leaving the board are Graham Tyson, a retired Agoura Hills computer 
company executive, and James W. Storey, a New England-based consultant. 
</P>
<P>
The changes come as Emulex's revenue and profits have seriously eroded in the 
past year as part of the general decline in the computer industry. The 
850-employee manufacturer of computer storage devices and data communications 
equipment posted net income of $208,000 for the first six months of its fiscal 
year ending Dec. 31, contrasted with earnings of $7.3 million for the same 
period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a tough six months," Petersen said. But he said the firm's sagging 
financial performance "did not have any influence" on the directors' 
resignations. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the slots will be filled by David Hanna, a longtime IBM Corp. executive 
who heads a Silicon Valley consulting firm, and P. Andrews McLane, a general 
partner in a Boston venture capital firm, Emulex said. 
</P>
<P>
Emulex Chairman Fred B. Cox will continue as a director, along with Robert H. 
Goon. Cox was unavailable for comment, but in a statement he praised Tyson and 
Storey as "able businessmen" who have "contributed significantly to the company 
during the past two years." 
</P>
<P>
He said Hanna has 14 years of experience with IBM and was chief executive 
officer at Grid Systems, Altos Computer Systems, NetFRAME, State of the Art 
Inc., the Versatec division of Xerox Corp. and Xerox Desktop Software. 
</P>
<P>
"Hanna is a respected and accomplished member of our industry, and his in-depth 
understanding of our markets and business activities will be of great 
assistance," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
McLane is a general partner of TA Associates, a venture capital firm that has 
been involved in financing high-technology companies for 17 years, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Tyson said he resigned voluntarily and agreed with the 
decision to change the board's makeup. 
</P>
<P>
"The computer business as a whole has been well below expectations throughout 
the country," Tyson said. "It's a different environment. Everybody is going to 
have to rethink their programs."

MORNING REPORT: ROONEY'S RETURN GIVES CBS RATINGS A BOOST

With a big boost from Andy Rooney and the rest of its Sunday-night lineup, CBS 
climbed out of the cellar last week and placed second in the prime-time ratings 
behind NBC, figures from the A.C. Nielsen Co. showed Tuesday. Rooney's return 
to "60 Minutes" after a three-week suspension helped generate ratings about two 
points higher (1.8 million homes) than its season average. 
</P>
<P>
"Murder, She Wrote" placed 12th among the week's 85 prime-time programs, and 
the CBS movie, "The Incident," finished 7th. ABC finished third for the week 
but its nightly newscast, "World News Tonight," handily beat the competition on 
the other two networks. The full list of ratings is on Page 10. 
</P>
<P>
* ABC didn't get any ratings help from "H.E.L.P.," the rescue drama that 
debuted last Saturday. The new series ranked 79th for the week, attracting only 
12% of the viewers watching TV between 8 and 9 p.m. NBC's "Alf," moving over 
from Monday night, won the 8 p.m. competition with 21% of the audience.

CATHEDRAL TO OFFER REFUGE IN SPRAYINGS; 
</P>
<P>
MALATHION: ANAHEIM FACILITY RUN BY REV. SCHULLER WILL HOUSE HOMELESS DURING 
AERIAL PESTICIDE APPLICATIONS.

The Crystal Cathedral has agreed to provide a haven where the homeless can take 
refuge during aerial malathion spraying, Orange County Supervisor Harriett M. 
Wieder announced at a news conference this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder then used the forum to lash out at Gov. George Deukmejian and the state 
Department of Food and Agriculture for what she called their bureaucratic 
insensitivity to public fears raised by the state's pesticide program to combat 
the Mediterranean fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
"While we do have an answer to how do we handle the homeless while the spraying 
is going on," Wieider said, the controversy "really reflects poor planning on 
the part of the governor and on the part of the Department of Food and 
Agriculture." 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement announced by Wieder, the Rev. Robert Schuller, pastor of 
the Crystal Cathedral, will put up the homeless in a facility in Anaheim where 
his "Hour of Power" service was once broadcast. The county will provide cots 
and blankets for the homeless who will be permitted to stay overnight Thursday 
when the Garden Grove area is scheduled for another aerial application of the 
pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
The homeless will be picked up in vans provided by the Orange County Homeless 
Task Force at gathering sites throughout the area. Those include Pioneer Park 
in Garden Grove, the corner of Bristol and Fairview streets in Santa Ana, Hart 
Park in Anaheim and a still-to-be-identified church in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The state, Wieder said, has agreed to provide three trained social workers to 
staff the overnight shelter. The homeless will be shuttled to the shelter at 5 
p.m. Thursday and returned to the gathering points by 7:30 the next morning, a 
homeless task force representative at the news conference said. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder said the state has agreed to help with future arrangements for any 
future malathion spraying in the area. "They finally are listening and trying 
to be reasonable," Wieder said. 
</P>
<P>
At the board's regular meeting this morning, county agricultural officials 
announced that the Department of Food and Agriculture will hold a hearing on 
the malathion spraying program March 19 in the county Hall of Administration in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Both Wieder and Supervisor Roger R. Stanton questioned the efficacy of such a 
hearing. Stanton noted that the sponsor was "not exactly a neutral party." Said 
Wieder: "I think it's a lot of spinning of wheels to justify their action." 
</P>
<P>
As they have done since last November, county supervisors renewed by a 3-2 vote 
a proclamation declaring a local emergency in the battle against the 
infestation of the Mediterranean fruit fly. Supervisors supporting the 
declaration argue that the local state of emergency is needed to protect the 
county against possible massive lawsuits that could arise out of the spraying.

Los Angeles County Sheriff Sgt. Robert R. Sobel, the central figure in a money 
skimming scandal, pleaded guilty today to a federal conspiracy charge and 
admitted his role in the alleged theft of seized drug money.

Sobel, 45, also pleaded guilty to a single count of filing a false income tax 
return and has agreed to cooperate with government prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Nine other veteran narcotics officers have pleaded not guilty to charges that 
they participated in the theft of more than $1.4 million in seized drug cash. 
The wife of one of the deputies was also indicted on charges that she helped 
disguise the stolen money in various bank accounts. She also pleaded not 
guilty.

The Bush Administration said today that it is encouraged by the latest comments 
from Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani saying a solution to the plight of 
the Western hostages in Lebanon is near. 
</P>
<P>
"We're encouraged by the comments. . . . They certainly are more hopeful than 
what we've heard in the more distant past," White House spokesman Marlin 
Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency today quoted Rafsanjani as saying, 
"My feeling is that the issue of the hostages is moving toward a solution." 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani repeated Iran's demands that Western nations help trace Iranian 
hostages missing in Lebanon and "also reduce their mischievous acts," the news 
agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said the remarks "are in line with statements that we have seen in 
recent days and weeks that there was some interest in Iran in better relations 
with the West. We hope that that's the case and that it will result in release 
of the hostages." 
</P>
<P>
The White House spokesman added, "But we have no direct knowledge that that is 
going to happen, and we have no direct knowledge of Mr. Rafsanjani's motives or 
purposes in making those remarks." 
</P>
<P>
In Lebanon, a group holding two hostages said today that it has no intention of 
freeing the captives. 
</P>
<P>
The Revolutionary Justice Organization also accused the United States of 
planning a military operation to free the hostages. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Tehran Times said that 1990 would be the last year for 
captivity for the hostages and that a resumption of ties with the United States 
is not a condition for their release.

Nicolae Ceausescu's bodyguards walked free today after they told a military 
court they had simply obeyed orders when they helped the executed Romanian 
dictator in his abortive bid to flee last December's uprising. 
</P>
<P>
The four senior officers of the dreaded secret police rushed the fugitive 
Stalinist leader and his wife, Elena, to the roof of the Communist Party 
headquarters Dec. 22, where they fled in a helicopter to escape crowds baying 
for their blood. 
</P>
<P>
The couple were captured and shot by firing squad Dec. 25 after a military 
trial, which was later shown on television. 
</P>
<P>
The bodyguards were arrested on charges of undermining the economy, destroying 
public property and undermining state power. 
</P>
<P>
But they were acquitted by a military tribunal today after pleading that they 
had only been doing their duty.

Oliver L. North will be the first witness at the Iran-Contra trial of his 
former boss, John M. Poindexter, a federal judge ruled today, rejecting a 
defense motion to bar North from testifying because of alleged perjury. 
</P>
<P>
As jury selection for the trial entered its third day, U.S. District Judge 
Harold Greene revealed that Poindexter's lawyers had filed two sealed motions. 
</P>
<P>
The first, which Greene denied, asked that North not be allowed to testify 
during Poindexter's trial because North allegedly committed perjury during his 
own Iran-Contra trial last year. 
</P>
<P>
The second motion by Poindexter's lawyers seeks to limit North's testimony, and 
Greene said he will hold a hearing on that issue later. 
</P>
<P>
Full details of the motions were not clear because they were filed under seal 
and kept secret. Poindexter's lawyer, Richard Beckler, refused to discuss the 
matters in any detail.

Skippy, a once-lethargic red kangaroo at the San Francisco Zoo, finally has a 
heart that doctors hope keeps her hopping. 
</P>
<P>
The 7 1/2-year-old marsupial was recovering today after receiving the first 
pacemaker ever implanted in a zoo animal. 
</P>
<P>
Veterinarians discovered the middle-aged roo's slow-beating heart a few weeks 
ago while treating a small abscess on her right foot. Her condition 
deteriorated, and she was near death Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, three heart surgeons from UC San Francisco, helped by four 
anesthesiologists from Stanford University, put the two-ounce pacemaker into 
Skippy's neck. 
</P>
<P>
Before the surgery, the 80-pound animal's heart registered between 18 and 40 
beats a minute, far below the normal rate of 125 to 150, said Mike Sulak, zoo 
curator of mammals.

FOOD-LABELING CHANGES URGED TO UNDO 'MESS'

<P>
Health Secretary Louis W. Sullivan, calling the current food-labeling system "a 
real mess," said today the government will propose new regulations to give 
consumers more information about the foods they buy. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed changes would require disclosure of the fat, fiber and cholesterol 
content of most foods and require that they meet certain standardized 
definitions to be called "low fat" or "high fiber," Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan told a food policy conference that the current food-labeling system 
"is a real mess" that confuses and frustrates consumers. 
</P>
<P>
"The grocery store has become a Tower of Babel," he said, "and consumers need 
to be linguists, scientists and mind readers to understand the many labels they 
encounter. 
</P>
<P>
"Some food labels are hard to read and understand. Vital information is 
missing, and frankly some unfounded health claims are being made in the 
marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan said the Food and Drug Administration will propose a three-phase 
change in food-labeling regulations, starting with provisions that have the 
most support. 
</P>
<P>
In the next six months, the FDA will issue a proposal requiring nutrition 
labeling for most foods. Currently, nutrition labeling is required only when a 
food manufacturer adds vitamins, minerals or proteins or makes a nutritional 
claim about the product. About 60% of packaged foods list nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA also wants to revise the list of nutrients required on the label to 
include such things as saturated fat, fiber, cholesterol and calories from fat. 
Some currently required nutrients, including some vitamins, would be made 
optional. 
</P>
<P>
Later this year, the FDA plans to define food descriptions such as "low fat" 
and "high fiber" and determine whether to require percentage listing of 
ingredients and whether specific flavors, colors and spices should be on the 
label. 
</P>
<P>
In the third phase, which will not begin until 1991, the FDA will propose 
revisions in the nutrition label format. 
</P>
<P>
Few changes in labeling requirements have been made over the last 17 years, and 
"clearly, the time has come for significant food-labeling reform," Sullivan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The last time U.S. food labels were changed significantly was in 1973, when the 
FDA established requirements based on a conference convened by President 
Richard M. Nixon.

clashed today over U.S. Middle East peace proposals, but a Cabinet vote on the 
plan was postponed until the weekend.

Labor leaders said that if Likud rejects the American proposals at Sunday's 
Cabinet session, they will ask Labor's Central Committee to vote the next day 
on leaving the government and forming a new coalition with small religious and

<P>
Economics Minister Moshe Shahal, a Labor member, told reporters after the

The House today upheld President Bush's veto of a bill to let the government 
intervene in the year-old Eastern Airlines dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The 261-160 vote was seven votes short of the two-thirds needed to overturn the 
veto. 
</P>
<P>
At issue was Bush's quashing of a measure creating a special panel to 
investigate and recommend solutions to the bitter dispute between Eastern and 
8,500 mechanics and other ground service workers. 
</P>
<P>
Override supporters said it was the last chance to save the bankrupt carrier 
and jobs for the machinists who walked out last March. But members who sided 
with Bush said a congressional panel would not be able to solve the dispute, 
and the matter belonged in bankruptcy court.

GROUP OF 7 MEETS TO DISCUSS HOW TO PROP UP THE SAGGING YEN

<P>
Senior officials from the major capitalist nations met today in Japan to 
discuss ways of propping up the sagging yen, which has pummeled the Tokyo stock 
market and may impede progress on cutting the massive U.S. trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Monetary sources said officials from the Group of Seven -- the United States, 
Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada -- met at a secret 
location. 
</P>
<P>
As the G-7 talks were under way, the yen's value fell to an eight-month low as 
the rate of exchange rose to 150.98 to the dollar before rebounding slightly. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo believes the falling yen will lead to a burst of domestic inflation, but 
the prescription of higher interest rates often used by central bankers to 
combat inflation and prop up a weak currency is a risky one. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Bank of Japan fear a rise in Japan's discount rate from its 
current 4.25% could topple the Tokyo stock market, and perhaps trigger a 
worldwide stock market crash. 
</P>
<P>
But continued yen weakness could also lower the price of Japanese exports, 
undermining progress on trimming the $49-billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan 
at a time when relations between the two nations are particularly tense.

A key index monitoring advertising placed by companies seeking employees was 
down three points in January compared to December, a nationwide survey said 
today.

<P>
The Conference Board, a nonprofit research organization, said in a survey that 
its Help-Wanted Advertising Index slipped to 146 in January, down from 149 in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
The monthly indicator, first set at 100 in 1967, is based on the help-wanted 
advertising volume in 51 major newspapers across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The January figure reading is up only one point from the November figure, but 
five points below the October figure and substantially lower than the year-ago 
figure of 155," the survey said. 
</P>
<P>
Among regions recording a decline was the Pacific, down to 269 from 290.

HARRODS' BUYERS LIED REPEATEDLY, BRITAIN REPORTS

<P>
The Al Fayed brothers lied during their successful 1985 takeover of Harrods' 
owner, House of Fraser PLC, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
"They repeatedly lied to us about their family background, their early business 
life and their wealth," according to a 752-page report by the Department of 
Trade and Industry. 
</P>
<P>
The government released the previously withheld report after the Serious Fraud 
Office and the director of public prosecutions decided that they would not 
pursue a criminal prosecution stemming from the $1-billion takeover. 
</P>
<P>
The report said documents produced by the Al Fayeds as evidence for the trade 
department's investigation, including their birth certificates, were false and 
they knew they were false. 
</P>
<P>
The Al Fayeds denied that they misled anyone. In a statement issued today they 
said they bought House of Fraser with their own cash. 
</P>
<P>
The government's decision not to prosecute was a major setback for Roland 
(Tiny) Rowland, the Lonrho PLC chairman who was a rival bidder for the famous 
Harrods department store and its parent company. 
</P>
<P>
Rowland has waged a long, expensive and very public campaign to have the 
takeover reversed, repeatedly alleging that the Al Fayeds misrepresented their 
background and wealth to win Harrods. 
</P>
<P>
The report said it is likely that the Egyptian-born brothers used their 
association with the Sultan of Brunei to raise funds toward the purchase of the 
department store chain. 
</P>
<P>
"We are of the very clear opinion that none of the activities of the Al Fayeds 
of which we have been told generated sufficient cash for the Al Fayeds to have 
been in a position to acquire House of Fraser, or any substantial part of it, 
with their own funds," trade department inspectors Hugh Aldous and Sir Henry 
Brooke said in their report. 
</P>
<P>
The Al Fayeds denied that anyone else was involved. 
</P>
<P>
"You would think . . . that if there was some mystery figure behind the scenes 
who was the real beneficial owner of House of Fraser, he or she might by now 
have shown himself or herself, or hinted that he or she was the proud owner of 
Europe's biggest department store group and proprietor of its most celebrated 
and prestigious component -- Harrods itself," the Al Fayeds said. 
</P>
<P>
The report said the misleading information was given greater credibility by 
officials because it was repeated by the brothers' reputable financial 
advisers, who took what their clients said at face value.

MGM/UA AGREES TO $1-BILLION BUYOUT BY EUROPEAN COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a deal combining two of the oldest names in the film industry, MGM/UA 
Communications Co. said today it agreed to be bought by the European film 
conglomerate Pathe Communications Corp. for just over $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
For MGM/UA, the deal ends a Hollywood epic in which the studio, headed by 
reclusive movie mogul Kirk Kerkorian, sought a buyer and saw a number of deals 
fall apart. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new proposal, Pathe Communications Corp., which takes its name from 
Pathe Cinema S.A. of France, a 100-year-old company, will begin a tender offer 
paying $20 a share for MGM within five days. 
</P>
<P>
The offer is a sharp premium over the $14 close of the MGM/UA stock Tuesday. 
But it is well below the $25 proposed last year by one serious suitor. 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA said the transaction has been approved by both boards and requires 
filings with government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Pathe is a diversified film producer with a film library of more than 1,200 
titles. It controls more than 1,000 movie screens in five countries and has 
film production facilities in Italy and a film laboratory in France. 
</P>
<P>
MGM, the descendant of Hollywood pioneer Metro Goldwyn Mayer, has been in a 
decline in recent years, although it managed recent critical and box office 
hits such as "Moonstruck" and "A Fish Called Wanda." The UA in its title 
derives from the old-line Hollywood studio, United Artists, whose 1,000-title 
library belongs to MGM/UA. 
</P>
<P>
Kerkorian, known more for the creativity of his financing than for his film 
artistry, has talked with a number of buyers, and a $1.5-billion deal with the 
Australian entertainment company, Qintex Ltd., was scrapped as it neared 
completion. 
</P>
<P>
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. was also close to acquiring MGM/UA. Japan's Sony 
Corp., Turner Broadcasting Co. and cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. were 
also said to be in talks about acquiring MGM/UA at one point. 
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, MGM/UA's principal shareholder, Tracinda Corp., headed by 
Kerkorian, has agreed to tender all its common and preferred shares at the 
tender price, and closing of the transaction is expected by June 23. 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA has about 51 million common and 10 million preferred shares outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
The company said that in support of the transaction, Pathe has agreed to place 
$200 million into an escrow account in increments of $50 million each on March 
9, April 9, May 9 and June 9. 
</P>
<P>
It said Pathe has also granted MGM/UA distribution rights and a security 
interest in up to $75 million of the net distribution proceeds of certain 
motion pictures as additional security for Pathe's performance under the 
agreement.

Sony and electronics experts described the Palm Top PTC-500 as a significant 
breakthrough that could make personal computers as common as Walkman portable 
stereos. 
</P>
<P>
"This machine has historical significance," said Toshi Doi, the director of 
Sony's microcomputer group. "The product is targeted for a far wider range of 
potential users in the coming era of a computer for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
The computer, which measures 8.2 inches by 6.3 inches with a height of 1.8 
inches, uses "fuzzy logic" to recognize letters drawn on a 6-by-4-inch screen 
and convert them into typed letters that can be printed out on a computer 
printer or fax machine. 
</P>
<P>
It eliminates the need to learn how to type on a keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
The Palm Top computer will debut in Japan on April 1 at a cost of $1,320.

'DIE HARD' SEQUEL PUTS TINY MICHIGAN TOWN ON THE MAP

ALPENA, Mich. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two weeks ago, this was a northern Michigan town on the frozen Lake Huron 
shore, average by Midwest standards. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, through the magic of Hollywood, Alpena and its tiny regional 
airport became an East Coast hub held by elite terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
The transformation was fast. 
</P>
<P>
Twentieth Century Fox didn't decide to shoot major portions of its latest Bruce 
Willis thriller, "Die Hard II," in this town of 12,000 until Feb. 23, after 
rain washed out the snow at Moses Lake, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
Charter jets and semitrailers brought an entire production unit to town in 
days, filling every hotel room, exhausting the supply of rental cars and adding 
400 local citizens to the casts as extras. 
</P>
<P>
When the nine days of shooting ends, the film company will have pumped $1 
million into the local economy, said Alpena Chamber of Commerce spokeswoman 
Karen Pettalia. 
</P>
<P>
"It's Hollywood comes to Alpena," said Marcia Bolitin, a film publicist who 
flew in from Los Angeles. She has spent much of her time telling the media that 
they can't even come close to the set. 
</P>
<P>
Willis is staying in Alpena, though no one will reveal where. Pettalia said he 
and other movie VIPs have moved into the homes of a handful of Alpena 
residents, who in turn have moved out. 
</P>
<P>
The movie, set for June release, parallels Willis' "Die Hard" about a New York 
cop who single-handedly takes on a terrorist situation. This time it's at an 
East Coast airport under siege. 
</P>
<P>
The Michigan Film Commission is crowing about their cinematic windfall. 
"Usually we only get bit parts," said commission Director Deryl Beasley. 
</P>
<P>
Beasley said he was in Los Angeles the day producers called Lansing to say they 
were looking for an alternate shooting site. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in their office in 20 minutes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Beasley said he expects a good pay-back even though "Die Hard" viewers won't 
realize it's Alpena they're watching. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter," he said. "Films like 'Die Hard II' are good PR."

Actor Paul Newman and his partners are "more confident than ever" heading into 
a second trial of a suit by a Westport deli owner who wants a cut of Newman's 
food business, Newman's lawyer said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Academy Award-winning actor, who testified at the first trial, will take 
the stand in the second proceeding, said his attorney, W. Patrick Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
Jury selection was to begin today in the Superior Court rematch between Newman 
and Julius Gold, who claims that he helped the actor develop his Newman's Own 
salad dressing and other food products. 
</P>
<P>
The first trial, which drew hordes of media, ended in a mistrial in July, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Gold, who has said he intended to pursue the case to the end, claimed that 
Newman and his partners, writer A. E. Hotchner and food broker David Kalman, 
reneged on verbal promises to give him a share of the profits and stock in the 
company to help develop and market the food products. 
</P>
<P>
Newman, who lives in Westport, has denied Gold's claims, saying he developed 
the salad dressing in his home and then decided to sell it with the profits 
going to charity. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which also sells popcorn, lemonade and spaghetti sauce, has 
donated more than $26 million to charity since it was founded in 1982, officers 
said.

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: CHRYSANTHEMUM FLOWERS, FORMIC ACID BATTLE NITS

Myths die hard. When we were children lice were considered a sign of 
slovenliness. Memories of kerosene shampoos and short haircuts still send 
shivers down parents' spines. 
</P>
<P>
Even these days, most school nurses get a pained expression on their faces at 
the mention of lice. They're on the front line of this epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
Despite effective lice shampoos, ridding a school of these unwanted intruders 
is not always easy, which is why most schools demand that their children's 
scalps be free of nits (tiny white louse eggs) -- before the child can return. 
</P>
<P>
A mother cornered us at a recent gathering and whispered that her daughter had 
been sent home with lice. This woman was incensed that she had been called at 
work and forced to pick her child up in the middle of the day. 
</P>
<P>
She felt humiliated and annoyed that she had to spend several hours after 
treating her daughter with lice shampoo trying to comb the nits out of the 
child's long, curly hair. 
</P>
<P>
Once upon a time the No Nit rule was the only effective way to control lice. 
Over-the-counter shampoos (A-200, R &amp; C and Rid) only kill lice. The eggs, 
which can hatch up to 10 days later, are resistant. Consequently, it was 
essential to comb out the nits to prevent reinfestation. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, there are prescription products that are highly effective and 
may offer an alternative to nit removal. Ovide (malathion) is capable of 
killing nits as well as lice. And Nix Creme Rinse (permethrin) stays on the 
hair to kill young lice as they emerge from the egg. With one application 97% 
to 99% of children are louse-free after two weeks, even without nit removal. 
</P>
<P>
Nix is easier to use than Ovide and the active ingredient permethrin is a 
derivative of chrysanthemum flowers. The insecticidal properties of this plant 
have been appreciated for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
As effective as the new prescription products may be, schools are unlikely to 
change No Nit policies, as they cannot require all children be treated with an 
expensive prescription. 
</P>
<P>
To make nit removal easier, parents may wish to try a new over-the-counter 
preparation (Step 2 from the GenDerm Corp.). It contains formic acid which 
helps loosen the eggs after lice shampoo treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the stigma associated with lice, anyone can have them.

ATTORNEYS TO NEGOTIATE VALVANO DEAL;

BASKETBALL: THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WILL HELP NEGOTIATE TERMINATION

<TEXT>
<P>
North Carolina State today brought in the state attorney general's office and a 
private attorney to negotiate the termination of basketball Coach Jim Valvano's 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
"This morning, the UNC Board of Governors has asked the attorney general's 
office to become directly involved in negotiations, and we have agreed," John 
Simmons, a spokesman for Atty. Gen. Lacy Thornburg, said today. 
</P>
<P>
"Further, the North Carolina State University board of trustees, because of the 
sensitivity of the negotiations, feels it would be helpful to also involve an 
attorney from the private sector, and the attorney general supports that idea 
so long as nonstate funds are used for the private attorney," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The executive committee of the N.C. State board of trustees, in a conference 
call Tuesday, gave a vote of support to the university administrators handling 
the talks with Valvano and his lawyer. The committee also voted to seek private 
counsel to represent the university. 
</P>
<P>
Calls for Valvano's resignation came last week after an ABC News report saying 
a former North Carolina State player had shaved points. 
</P>
<P>
A New Jersey prosecutor said there wasn't enough evidence to warrant criminal 
charges in that state on the alleged point-shaving scheme involving former 
Wolfpack star Charles Shackleford and a New Jersey businessman. But North 
Carolina authorities said they will press ahead with their probe. 
</P>
<P>
The Charlotte Observer reported today that sources close to the negotiations 
said the board wants to avoid a huge settlement payment, and the decision was 
influenced by the $800,000 buyout North Carolina paid to football Coach Dick 
Crum two years ago. North Carolina was represented in those negotiations by the 
university's legal counsel, Susan Ehringhaus. 
</P>
<P>
"We would expect to have a resolution of the problem, as far as the university 
is concerned, shortly," said NCSU trustee Troy Doby of Raleigh, one of the 
executive committee members. "This is not to say that Mr. Valvano will not 
remain our coach for a while. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not going to be one of those killer deals," he said, "We don't 
anticipate the kinds of problems Carolina had with Coach Dick Crum." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Gibbons, a spokesman for Valvano's lawyer, Art Kaminsky in New York, said 
no negotiations were under way. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that basically everything at this point is up to the university," 
Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
Valvano and university administrators said it is time to turn their sights on 
this weekend's Atlantic Coast Conference tournament.

U.S. SKATING CHAMPION JILL TRENARY TRIUMPHS IN FIGURES OVER TITLIST ITO

Midori Ito of Japan all but conceded her women's title today as American Jill 
Trenary triumphed in the last compulsory figures to be staged at the World 
Figure Skating Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Trenary won the section with Ito a lowly 10th, and the Japanese now needs more 
than her vaunted jumping ability to retain the crown. 
</P>
<P>
Ito quickly fled the figures arena after her second figure, which was a 
catastrophe. She had been sixth after the first figure, the double three, but 
fell four places with her second, the loops. 
</P>
<P>
One judge rated it 26th best in the field of 29, although overall it was 14th. 
She lost balance and momentum early in the tracing and almost stopped halfway 
through. 
</P>
<P>
"She was shaky, everything shook," another coach said. "She needed her talent 
and strength just to finish it." 
</P>
<P>
For Trenary, the figures result put her into an extremely strong position. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Ito wins the original and free programs, as she did to capture the 
title last year after being sixth in figures, Ito will need help from other 
skaters to catch Trenary. 
</P>
<P>
Trenary could still beat her by placing third in both remaining sections. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm trying not to focus on the spread, and there are other skaters to 
worry about," the 21-year-old American said. "I still have to do my thing." 
</P>
<P>
Her main rivals now appear to be Natalia Lebedeva of the Soviet Union and 
Patricia Neske of West Germany, who were second and third in the compulsory 
section. 
</P>
<P>
Lebedeva looked certain to win the European title last month until she flopped 
badly in her free program, but if she can hold her nerve she has the ability to 
win. So does Neske, who had a similar experience in Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
European champion Evelyn Grossmann of East Germany placed only 12th while the 
acrobatic young Frenchwoman Surya Bonaly was 15th. Both are too far back to 
have medal chances. 
</P>
<P>
Trenary won the first figure and was second in the loops behind the surprising 
Holly Cook, who barely made the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
Trenary, who skated a poor final program last year when she had a chance to 
win, said: "I made a little mistake in the loops. Last night I was thinking 
horrible thoughts about what might go wrong, which I shouldn't do. 
</P>
<P>
"But I wanted to win the figures and now I'm looking ahead. This is an exciting 
position to be in." 
</P>
<P>
When Zeljka Cizmesija of Yugoslavia skated the last figure, fans threw flowers 
and boxes of chocolates to the ice and British judge Vanessa Riley wept openly. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is just so very sad," said Riley, regarded as the toughest but 
fairest judge on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
The figures were consigned to oblivion by an International Skating Union (ISU) 
ballot of their members in 1988. Abolition formally takes effect July 1, but 
this was the competitive finale.

Harris, who suffered four heart attacks in the last two years, died Tuesday at 
Temple University Hospital, where he had been a patient since Feb. 10. 
</P>
<P>
His sister, Daaiyah Waheed, attributed the death to heart failure. 
</P>
<P>
Harris was born in Camden, N.J., and raised in North Philadelphia. A street 
fight blinded his right eye when he was 11, but he pursued boxing anyway and 
won 24 of 25 fights. 
</P>
<P>
He lost his only fight on Aug. 6, 1968, in a decision to former champion Emile 
Griffith. A routine physical examination two months later by the Pennsylvania 
State Athletic Commission showed him to be blind in his right eye, and his 
boxing license was revoked.

SUNDAY SILENCE, EASY GOER TO MEET IN $1-MILLION INVITATIONAL AUG. 4

<P>
Sunday Silence and Easy Goer, last year's top two U.S. thoroughbreds, will 
renew the hottest rivalry in horse racing at a $1-million invitational race 
Aug. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Arlington International Racecourse said Tuesday that it will host the 1 
1/4-mile race on dirt that will reunite the two horses who thrilled the fans in 
four exciting races last year which ended 3-1 in favor of Sunday Silence. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness, and, in their last 
meeting, the Breeders' Cup Classic in November. Easy Goer denied the black colt 
the honor of the Triple Crown by capturing the Belmont Stakes by eight lengths. 
</P>
<P>
The invitational is to be held at the track in Chicago's northern suburbs less 
than a month before the Arlington Million, a race on grass that features an 
international field. Sunday Silence trainer Charlie Whittingham has nominated 
his horse for that 1 1/4-mile event as well.

The licenses of two Finger Lakes Race Track trainers have been suspended in the 
wake of their indictments in federal court for allegedly conspiring to fix a 
race at the track. 
</P>
<P>
New York State Racing and Wagering Board officials said a hearing has been 
scheduled on the suspension of Michael Ferraro's and Edward Babcock's licenses. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, they "can't go to a race track in New York state," said board 
secretary Thomas Davide. 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro, Babcock and Ferraro's former wife, Patricia, pleaded innocent on 
Tuesday in U.S. District Court to charges that they fixed the eighth race at 
Finger Lakes on Sept. 26 to ensure that two horses finished out of the money. 
An indictment released last week said Patricia Ferraro bet heavily on other 
horses in the race.

<P>
PERSONALITY: FRED HAYMAN, WORKING ALONE, WANTS TO TOP THE SUCCESS HE HAD WITH 
THE GIORGIO FASHION, FRAGRANCE EMPIRE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
From afar, it looks like it had one of those face-lifts that Beverly Hills is 
so famous for -- the kind where you seem the same, only different. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the awnings, the topiary, the oak bar and the pool table of the old 
Giorgio at 273 North Rodeo Drive are still there, along with the photos of 
Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand and Elizabeth Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
But come closer. See the new wrinkles. 
</P>
<P>
The logo that used to be Giorgio's familiar red and black crest is now the 
unfamiliar red and black signature of "Fred Hayman." The distinctive color 
scheme that used to be sunny yellow and white is now a sophisticated solid 
yellow. The ubiquitous vase-shaped bottles of Giorgio perfume that used to 
cover the fragrance counter are now the little-known crystal pyramids of "273." 
The young and oh-so-trendy "rich hippies" who used to loll in the aisles are 
now middle-aged and (dare you say it?) a bit matronly. 
</P>
<P>
And a couple of tourists who wanted to buy Giorgio sweat shirts in bulk are now 
wondering if they're in the right place. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't Giorgio," the puzzled wife whispers to her husband. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," he responds, "this place belongs to some guy named Fred." 
</P>
<P>
Almost on cue, they turn around and leave. 
</P>
<P>
Told about the little scene later, the guy named Fred, a short man with a shock 
of white hair, can't help but wince. For Fred Hayman, the 
multi-multimillionaire who founded the Giorgio fashion and fragrance empire, 
knows only too well that splitting up one of the world's most successful 
retailing marriages, selling off Giorgio and starting over on his own has meant 
a lot more work than just a nip-and-tuck job on the store. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe more work than a soon-to-be 65-year-old should want to take on. What's he 
trying to prove -- and to whom? 
</P>
<P>
"There's never been anyone who's ever been No. 1 twice. And I'm going to be the 
first one in the business to do it," pledges Hayman, whose unshakable faith in 
himself is as much a fixture of his year-old business as the 1952 Silver 
Wraithe Rolls-Royce parked outside (and recently repainted solid yellow). 
</P>
<P>
"If I had his money, I wouldn't bother," confides friendly competitor Herb 
Fink, founder of Rodeo Drive's Theodore stores. "But Fred has painted himself 
into a corner now where he has to work harder than ever before. I wouldn't want 
to trade places with him. The stress has got to be astronomical." 
</P>
<P>
Fink pauses. "But, then, Fred's not the kind of person who could ever retire." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Hayman appears stunned that anyone would even dare to bring up the "R" 
word. 
</P>
<P>
"Boring, boring, boring," he says huffily, a hard glint in his blue eyes. "No, 
I wouldn't have a grand old time on Frank Sinatra Drive in Palm Springs or at 
my beach cottage in Malibu. I'd have a grand old time for maybe a week. But 
then what would I do? I don't have any hobbies. I'd drive everyone around me 
crazy. 
</P>
<P>
"I love to work. I love the business. I love the enormous opportunity and 
challenge." And more than anything, he loves the store. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very thrilled to own this business totally by myself," he says pointedly. 
</P>
<P>
To understand why Hayman will travel 100,000 miles this year, spritzing perfume 
at strangers and stocking up on $5,000 sequined gowns that stars and socialites 
will wear once and then discard, it's necessary to see where he has been 
already. 
</P>
<P>
And that was bound to Gale Hayman, in marriage and in business. 
</P>
<P>
Long before the War of the Trumps grabbed its first headline, the gurus of 
glamour -- at least in the minds of many Southern Californians -- were Gale and 
Fred Hayman. 
</P>
<P>
Like Donald, he was social-climbing and shrewd. Like Ivana, she was sharp and 
chic. They, too, cultivated a public image as the "perfect couple." And their 
divorce also brought down more than a marriage; it brought down a marketing 
phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
Together, 28 years ago, the one-time Beverly Hilton banquet manager and 
cocktail waitress transformed a struggling boutique called Giorgio into a 
household name, with the highest sales-per-square-foot of any store in the 
country and a world-renown fragrance. In the process, the Haymans racked up a 
rags-to-riches fortune and inspired Judith Krantz's blockbuster novel 
"Scruples." Their store starred in the TV miniseries. Their perfume, introduced 
in 1981, became so inescapable that a New York City restaurant banned it. 
</P>
<P>
But on the road to success, their marriage bottomed out, starting in 1978 and 
ending in divorce five years later. Still, they were able to work together 
until both started claiming credit for the phenomenon that was Giorgio. That's 
when things really turned ugly between them. In just one example, the locks on 
the doors of the Giorgio offices were changed to keep Gale out in 1985. In 
turn, she dressed him down in front of business associates. 
</P>
<P>
For the next two years, the Haymans fought over custody of the business. 
Finally, stalemated and sick of each other, they sold Giorgio to Avon in 1987 
for $165 million and divvied up the spoils. While Gale started a cosmetics 
company, Hayman bought back the store for $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the once-inseparable Mr. and Mrs. Giorgio live separate lives, run 
separate companies and harbor separate resentments. 
</P>
<P>
But so far Gale has been the only one to air them publicly, including 20 hours 
of interviews to Women's Wear Daily Los Angeles bureau chief Steve Ginsberg for 
his just-published book "Reeking Havoc: The Unauthorized Story of Giorgio." 
</P>
<P>
But Hayman wouldn't talk -- until now. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's just coincidence, but the timing of this interview comes just as the 
two Haymans will be together again -- that is, just as their signature perfumes 
will be together on swank store shelves. For Gale is introducing "Beverly 
Hills/Gale Hayman" in late April to compete for the affluent women who might be 
buying "273." (Gale Hayman declined to be interviewed for this article on her 
former husband.) 
</P>
<P>
"May the best man win. May we both win," notes the ex-husband, displaying his 
model European manners (although his official biography describing Giorgio's 
success doesn't even mention Gale). Already, one retailer selling "273" has 
asked Hayman "if it was OK" to carry Gale's perfume as well. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him it would be restraint of trade if I said it's not," Hayman says, 
carefully navigating what could be a legal mine field. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as the customers don't think Fred Hayman is Gale Hayman or Gale Hayman 
is Fred Hayman. This is what's important to Fred Hayman -- that she does not 
ride my coattails or vice versa. I will do everything to separate us, just as 
I'm doing everything possible not to be Mr. Giorgio any more." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, it's like pulling teeth to get him to recount the way they were. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to talk about that. It was the ugliest experience in life. 
</P>
<P>
"But there may never be another couple as great as we were. Or a store as great 
as Giorgio was," Hayman continues. "And there's a lesson in this for whomever 
may read what you print. That power and greed does strange things to people, 
that too much ego and too little loyalty are disgusting things, and that all of 
this comes out just when you have something very successful. It's really a damn 
shame, to be honest with you." 
</P>
<P>
Working alone now, Hayman is hoping that lightning will strike twice. But it's 
a different time. And a different retailing climate. 
</P>
<P>
Where once that corner where Rodeo Drive meets Wilshire Boulevard was the 
trend-setting capital of Southern California, maybe even the world, now that 
honor is accorded Melrose. Where once the Haymans secured exclusives on 
relatively unknown designers like Halston and Giorgio di Sant' Angelo, today 
many of the big names have their own stores. Where once the marketing of 
Giorgio by direct mail and scent strips was unheard-of, now the practice is 
commonplace. And where once launching a new perfume was seen as a rare event, 
today the proliferation of fragrances from every Tom, Dick and Cher is no more 
exciting than the opening of a mini-mall. 
</P>
<P>
Even Hayman acknowledges there is probably no way that Fred Hayman will ever be 
le dernier cri in fashionableness that Giorgio was. But that doesn't mean it 
can't be successful. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody just at lunch the other day said to me, 'You know, it was so much fun 
-- that little store and all the hot new things that you had. Why can't you 
have that today?' And I told her nobody can have that today. It just doesn't 
exist any more. Times change. That's the reality." 
</P>
<P>
Suzanne Pleshette, who was one of Giorgio's first and best customers, believes 
that attitude is why Hayman is such a "clever merchandiser. Today a lot of the 
people who were wearing trendy clothes then are more conservative now. We still 
remain Fred's customers, but our needs are different. If he hadn't changed, 
he'd have been foolish." 
</P>
<P>
And while the store may never be Madonna's, or Kim Basinger's, or Michelle 
Pfeiffer's favorite place to shop, Fred Hayman last year had $2,500 in sales 
per square foot, according to its own figures, better even than the $2,000 in 
sales per square foot that Giorgio enjoyed during its 1987 salad days. 
</P>
<P>
But the question remains: For how long? Especially as other top-drawer stores 
-- Amen Wardy of Newport Beach and Barney's of New York, to name two -- move 
into Beverly Hills. "Every time I've talked to Fred in the last six months, 
he's bad-mouthed his apparel business," says Women's Wear Daily's Ginsberg. 
"It's been tough for him. There's a lot more competition for Fred's-type 
merchandise in the last five years. I'm sure he's lost some business." 
</P>
<P>
When Hayman's contract with Avon dictated that he give up the Giorgio name and 
signature stripes, he gave the store his own moniker but kept the yellow -- not 
just because it recalls the old Giorgio, but because "it's California, it's 
Beverly Hills, it's happy. Yellow is simply what we are." 
</P>
<P>
He also started advertising heavily and looking for new avenues of publicity. 
For the second straight year, he sought and secured his selection as fashion 
coordinator for the Academy Awards, a rather thankless task but very 
high-profile within the entertainment and retailing industries. For one thing, 
it ensures that the biggest names in Hollywood -- especially those younger 
actors and actresses who might not remember Giorgio's heyday -- will at least 
walk into Hayman's store. 
</P>
<P>
That sort of marketing savvy also dictated that Hayman introduce "273" at "the 
party to end all parties" in January, 1989. Held on the "Phantom of the Opera" 
set at Universal Studios and catered by L.A.'s top restaurants, it attracted 
1,000 A-list guests most of whom, as producer Allan Carr decreed, "hadn't been 
to a party for a perfume since Coco Chanel died." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Hayman's gardenia scent has been a sensation. In just its first 
year, "273" boasted $5 million in sales through the boutique and direct mail. 
That's considered a strong debut despite its limited distribution, and 3.5 
times better than Giorgio in the same time period. With "273" at 273 perfume 
counters eventually (selected Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom, Bullock's, 
Robinson's, I. Magnin, Macy's, Neiman-Marcus, Filene's and Marshall Fields 
among other stores), sales figures are projected to top $40 million by the end 
of 1990. Another bright spot on Hayman's horizon is the "Fred Hayman" line of 
handbags, leather goods and luggage that began selling in the boutique last 
April and expands to Neiman-Marcus this year. According to Women's Wear Daily, 
the line rang up sales of $50,000 in the first two weeks and could hit $2 
million by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
I don't want to sound egotistical," Hayman boasts, "but I do have a certain 
style and taste level that never changes. And that is Fred Hayman." 
</P>
<P>
Dating as far back, perhaps, as the cradle. Born on May 29, 1925, in the Swiss 
textile town of St. Gallen, Hayman was 4 years old when his father died of a 
heart attack. A year later, his mother married Julius Hayman, a prosperous silk 
importer. 
</P>
<P>
While his mother was "very much into manners," his stepfather provided a 
comfortable life style. But that life was torn apart in 1941 when, like many 
Jewish families in Europe, the Haymans fled the threat of Nazism and immigrated 
to New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Hayman wanted to be a chef, but his parents wanted him to go to college. "They 
had higher ambitions. I wanted to prove to them that you don't have to go to a 
lot of schools to be successful. And wherever I went I tried to excel." 
</P>
<P>
He was hired by the prestigious Waldorf-Astoria Hotel where he rose from 
apprentice cook to banquet manager. In 1943, Conrad Hilton personally sent him 
to his new hotel, the Beverly Hilton. Always fascinated by glamour and wealth, 
Hayman found Beverly Hills to be exciting, but also "terribly backward. I 
brought with me a whole new standard of French service." 
</P>
<P>
Hayman became known for his taste and style, as well as for his driving 
ambition. After stints at the Ambassador Hotel, and then a downtown L.A. 
restaurant, Hayman was looking to buy a restaurant. Along the way, he married 
twice and had three children. It was while married to his second wife that 
Hayman hired a new cocktail waitress at the Beverly Hilton, 19-year-old Gale 
Gardner Miller. "She was a hot-looking dame then. Still is," Hayman says with a 
wink. "I haven't seen her, but I know she is." 
</P>
<P>
In 1963, Hayman divorced his wife and three years later married Gale. He was 41 
and she was 23, and they went into business together at a small Beverly Hills 
clothing store called Giorgio in which Hayman had been a silent partner. No 
task was too menial for him in those days: clipping the hedges, washing the 
windows, cleaning the chandeliers. 
</P>
<P>
This time around, however, Hayman has the luxury of starting out as a 
superstar. That means delegating to others responsibilities he might have taken 
on himself before. 
</P>
<P>
On a typical day, he arrives at his office at 9 a.m., leaves by 5 p.m., has a 
massage every evening (talking on the phone all the while) and spends a quiet 
evening at his Beverly Hills home with his girlfriend Betty Endo, a petite 
Japanese-American who was Clint Eastwood's secretary before she began dating 
Hayman 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday afternoons, like clockwork, he heads out to his Malibu beach 
cottage, if that's what you can call the 4,500-square-foot Point Dume home he 
owns next to Johnny Carson. He also maintains a second house a brisk 20-minute 
walk away that he keeps for entertaining because of its pool, spa, tennis court 
and formal dining room. 
</P>
<P>
It's life in the lap of luxury. But he'll keep on working, bringing out a 
second fragrance soon, expanding his line of accessories, maybe writing his 
autobiography. Anything else? 
</P>
<P>
"It'll blow your mind if I tell you," he teases. "I will open a department 
store unlike anything that's ever been opened. I'm not going to tell you how 
it's going to be. But I hope I will have the time to do it. That department 
store would be the last thing I would do that's grand and special and different 
and conversational and successful." 
</P>
<P>
The hard glint in his blue eyes dares the world to think otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"And more fun that just being all day at the damned beach house!"

<P>
Her dynamic performance in the 1988 Winter Olympics at Calgary, combined with 
the elimination of compulsory figures after 1990, made it inevitable that 
Japan's Midori Ito some day would rule women's figure skating. 
</P>
<P>
Even U.S. champion Jill Trenary knew the best she could hope for before last 
year's World Championships in Paris was that Ito's rise would be gradual 
instead of immediate. 
</P>
<P>
As the fourth-place finisher in Calgary behind three retiring medalists, 
Katarina Witt, Elizabeth Manley and Debi Thomas, Trenary was expected to 
inherit the title in Paris. Her expertise in figures, in contrast with Ito's 
haphazard etchings, was supposed to be her edge. 
</P>
<P>
But Ito, who was performing triple jumps as a 6-year-old in Japan, does nothing 
gradually. Trenary knew her cause was lost as soon as she saw her 4-foot-9, 
97-pound rival on the ice. Trenary acknowledged this week that she was 
intimidated by Ito, which she said accounted, at least in part, for her flawed 
freestyle performances and a third-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in awe," said Trenary, who shared practice time with Ito. "I didn't 
expect her to be as good as she was." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Trenary, she was not assigned to Ito's practice group for this 
year's World Championships, which begin today for the women with compulsory 
figures. But she said it would not have made much difference if she had been. 
She came here expecting the worst, which means Ito's best. 
</P>
<P>
"I've accepted it," Trenary said. "She's very talented." 
</P>
<P>
Trenary's coach, Carlo Fassi, said her only hope to beat Ito if both skate 
their best would be for the judges to reverse the trend of recent years in 
scoring and reward aesthetics instead of athleticism. 
</P>
<P>
This will not be good news for Trenary, but Ito, 20, claimed at a news 
conference Monday night that she has improved artistically. Until now, her 
reputation has been based solely on her jumping ability, which she said came 
naturally. 
</P>
<P>
"As a child, I felt I could master some of the jumps quicker than the other 
children," she said through an interpreter. "Jumps that would take them three 
hours to learn took me an hour and a half." 
</P>
<P>
As an 11-year-old in the World Junior Championships, she completed three triple 
jumps. Last year, she became the first woman to perform the most difficult 
triple jump, the axel, in competition. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, the challenge was the triple axel," she said. "Since I can do that 
now, this year I am trying to do more for artistic impression." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, she has been taking ballet lessons. Although her coach, Machiko 
Yamada, choreographed the freestyle program in the past, that duty fell this 
year to Ito's ballet teacher. 
</P>
<P>
But asked what it is about her skating that so excites crowds, she smiled and 
said, "Jumps." 
</P>
<P>
While other women -- the United States' Elaine Zayak, for example -- have built 
their programs around jumps, it is only since Ito emerged that it seems to have 
become required in order to impress international judges. Skaters who have 
followed Ito's lead include Californian Kristi Yamaguchi, second in the 
national championships to Trenary the last two years, and France's Surya 
Bonaly. 
</P>
<P>
Bonaly, 16, is a former gymnast who already is practicing quadruple jumps, 
which have been performed in a major competition by only one man, world 
champion Kurt Browning of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Bowman of Van Nuys, runner-up in last year's world championships, 
compares Ito to Browning. 
</P>
<P>
"Ito is fearless, and Kurt Browning has a lot of that quality," he said. "If 
they thought they could climb up on top of the rafters and jump off with their 
skates on, do six revolutions and have a chance of surviving, they would do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the trend, which they say was encouraged by the impending 
elimination of compulsory figures, fear it will increase the potential for 
injuries, particularly in young girls. 
</P>
<P>
Ito suffered an injured left ankle on a triple jump last May and has to have it 
heavily taped before going onto the ice. She said her own experimentation with 
quadruple jumps will be postponed until her ankle improves. 
</P>
<P>
For now, she is content to have seven triple jumps in her freestyle program. 
Her only problem in practice has been that the ice at the Halifax Metro Centre 
is barely large enough to contain her. On triple axels, she comes perilously 
close to crashing into the boards. Officials of the International Skating Union 
said the ice meets their minimum requirements but added that the increased 
emphasis on jumping might force them to revise their standards. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Nagoya, a city of 2 million, Ito was accomplished enough by age 4 to 
skate to the center of the ice rink and ask Yamada to coach her. Two years 
later, after her parents separated, she moved in with Yamada's family and has 
lived there since. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time, she accepted me as one of her children," Ito said. "So I didn't 
feel that I was a hardship for her." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, Ito divulges few details of her personal life. Her parents still 
live in Nagoya, but she said she keeps in touch with them primarily by 
telephone. She said her father is a businessman. Asked what kind, she said, "A 
regular businessman." 
</P>
<P>
She recently graduated in home economics from a two-year school, Tokai Gakuen 
Girls College, and soon will begin work for a large Japanese company, Prince 
Hotels, although she said she has not yet been informed of her job's 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
One of Japan's most popular athletes -- "I am not even able to go to the 
doughnut shop with my friends without being recognized" -- she recently 
received the ultimate honor in her country, an invitation to visit Emperor 
Akihito in his palace. 
</P>
<P>
She does not seem to have been affected by her fame. As exuberant as ever on 
the ice, Ito once was described as "a smile attached to wings." After 
particularly difficult jumps, she pumps a fist in the air. That is not typical 
of Japanese athletes, who usually are stoic while competing, but her coach quit 
trying years ago to change her. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to discipline, however, she is very Japanese. After finishing 
sixth last year in figures, which account for 20% of the final score, she had 
to win both freestyle programs to become the champion. In an attempt to 
improve, she said she has spent two-thirds of her practice time this year on 
the tedious tracings. That does not mean she has acquired a love for them, but 
she puts her head down and carries on. 
</P>
<P>
"Compulsories," she said, "are compulsory."
