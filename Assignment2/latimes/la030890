Cooking for a crowd has its exhilarating moments, especially when efforts are 
rewarded with resounding success. It also has its hazards, as the many cooks 
who have tried to increase some recipes by multiplication have realized -- 
often too late. 
</P>
<P>
One home cook, thinking that the two cups of dry beans called for in the recipe 
for six servings was hardly enough for one person, much less the eight people 
she was planning to serve, multiplied the recipe by eight. Little did she 
realize that beans swell to near triple their size upon cooking. She ended up 
having to hire a cleaning crew to sweep up the mess of beans that had expanded 
and oozed out of the pot, inching onto the kitchen floor and toward the door, a 
ferocious army on the march. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, it does take a knowledge of ingredients, the proper equipment and a sense 
of recipe development to be a large-scale cook. Quantity cooking is not just a 
matter of multiplying a recipe. Often, expanding a recipe can lead to flavor, 
texture and balance problems. Some foods, such as baked goods, jellies, jams 
and candies, are particularly fragile in their chemical makeup and require 
special formulation to accommodate the chemical changes that occur during 
cooking -- even when the recipe is minimally increased. 
</P>
<P>
If you have the equipment, the proper facilities and feel capable of handling 
quantity recipes, consider it the better part of valor to follow recipes 
already formulated to quantity size amounts. Without the proper equipment and 
know-how you are better off sticking to home-size recipes and cooking several 
batches. 
</P>
<P>
Readers who write to us about problems related to quantity size cooking are 
those who, of necessity, occasionally cook for club or other functions and need 
help with recipe ideas and amounts of food to purchase. "I need to plan 100 
turkey salad sandwiches in pita pockets and fruit carrot salad but can't 
determine the uncooked weight of turkey for 100," wrote Gloria L. Wise of 
Rolling Hills Estates. 
</P>
<P>
But organization and recipe development is not the only problem. Another may be 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
There are two camps of thought on cost, we found. 
</P>
<P>
One quantity cook opts for roasts in lieu of casseroles. "People don't realize 
that by the time they buy all the ingredients and put it all together that they 
are probably putting more money into a casserole than it would take to buy and 
prepare a simple roast. In addition, most guests prefer roasts with simple side 
dishes to fussy casseroles. Besides, you often get a better buy when purchasing 
meat in a larger size and doing the cutting yourself," said Times food news 
editor Marge Powers. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Starr of Highland Park, on the other hand, is satisfied with one-dish 
meals, such as turkey-noodle casserole or meat loaf, which he said work well 
when quadrupled and are relatively inexpensive. "Of course, such recipes are 
the exception," he wrote. "For one thing my budget is limited to a moderate $3 
to $4 per person, paid at the door (and we also serve wine and soft drinks, as 
well as hors d'oeuvres and coffee)." 
</P>
<P>
Once a month, Starr is called upon to prepare dinner for anywhere from 40 to 60 
members of a social organization to which he belongs. Since he must complete 
all preparation and cooking at home in his kitchen and transport the results to 
the homes of a revolving series of hosts, he is limited to one-dish meals, 
salads and desserts, alternating with the occasional ham or turkey. 
</P>
<P>
This brings us to some of the problems one may encounter and ways of solving 
them when cooking for a crowd. 
</P>
<P>
EQUIPMENT -- Check the equipment and utensils available well in advance, then 
borrow, rent or purchase any items that are required for preparation of the 
meal. Your local church, community center, school, catering establishment or 
restaurant may have large utensils they will lend or rent for the occasion. If 
you have an opportunity to purchase new equipment for a community kitchen, 
suggest that cookware made for restaurants and institutions be used, not 
home-size pots and pans. However, be certain that the equipment will fit the 
ovens and sinks. 
</P>
<P>
INCREASING RECIPE SIZE -- A good rule of thumb is to multiply a recipe for six 
by four times to make 25 servings; by eight to serve 50 and by 16 to serve 100. 
Don't attempt to increase recipes for baked goods, candies and jellies. 
</P>
<P>
SEASONING ADJUSTMENT -- When preparing recipes in quantity, seasonings must be 
adjusted accordingly. When making two times the recipe, use one and one-half 
times the amount of herb or spice called for. When the quantity is three times 
the recipe, use two times the amount of herb or spice; when making four times 
the recipe, adjust the herb and spice to two and one-half times the amount 
called for. 
</P>
<P>
BUYING GUIDE -- Most quantity recipe cooks have trouble deciding how much food 
to buy for servings of 25 or more. A Times' guide for quantity food preparation 
suggests the amounts of food to buy for 50 servings. Halve the amount for 25 
servings. You'll note amounts for seafood, fruit, meats, relishes, salads, 
vegetables, beverages, breads, casseroles, dairy products and desserts. 
Checking the chart, you will have an instant count for the amount of coffee to 
purchase to make 50 one-cup servings. You'll need eight pies to serve 50. 
</P>
<P>
PREPARATION/COOKING TIME -- You'll have to take into account the added 
preparation and cooking time needed for quantity recipes to compensate for 
cleaning, prepping, drying, or heating large quantities of ingredients. Larger 
pans require longer cooking, so the best policy is to follow the recipes to the 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
 SPACE -- Storage and refrigerator space is an important factor to consider 
when cooking for a crowd. Do you need more than one refrigerator? Do you have 
the freezer space for individual molds or casseroles? How about extra shelf or 
counter space for properly chilling or cooling dishes. Does your counter have 
enough space to lay out several pots and pans at one time? Is your oven large 
enough for institutional size equipment? 
</P>
<P>
FOOD SAFETY -- A key consideration in any food handling, especially large 
amounts of food that take longer to cool and might be candidates for food 
spoilage, is proper cooling. Stuffed poultry, ground meat, egg-containing 
products, such as mayonnaise, custard and sauces, could cause problems if 
allowed to stand too long at room temperature. Make sure that hot foods being 
held are heated to above 140 degrees. You might also want to supplement 
existing heating surfaces with the help of electric skillets, steam tables or 
hot trays. 
</P>
<P>
All fresh, cured and cooked meat must be kept in the refrigerator and used 
within two or three days. Thaw frozen meat just before cooking, preferably in 
the refrigerator. Meats cooked for future use should be cooled quickly, 
uncovered, in the refrigerator, or in a cool room with good air circulation. 
</P>
<P>
Meat and broth should be separated to hasten cooling. To rapidly cool broth, 
set it in a pan of running cold water before refrigeration. Stir the broth to 
prevent formation of fat that may seal in heat. Refrigerated coagulated fat can 
be removed before reheating to reduce fat content. Leave meat and broth 
uncovered until cool. Then cover and refrigerate. 
</P>
<P>
Hot cooked chicken or pieces of meat should be spread out on a flat pan to cool 
quickly and safely. Stacked hot meats stand a chance of developing harmful 
bacteria if allowed to stand too long. Large roasts may be cut into halves to 
cool. Stuffing should be removed from a turkey or other poultry and cooled 
separately. 
</P>
<P>
SEASONAL FOODS -- You'll get dollar and quality mileage by buying foods in 
season. 
</P>
<P>
A few miscellaneous tips when handling especially fragile foods: 
</P>
<P>
 -- To prevent noodles from sticking together, immerse in cold water until 
ready to use. For ease in serving, let lasagna stand 10 minutes before cutting. 
Lasagna may be combined ahead of time and refrigerated until ready to bake. 
Increase baking time about a half hour. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If making meat balls, combine the ingredients the day before and store 
covered in the refrigerator. The sauce can be prepared ahead and refrigerated. 
The cooked meat balls and sauce can be stored in the freezer for two months. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To make a gallon of broth using turkey carcass, simmer bones, one cup 
chopped onion and one tablespoon salt in one gallon of water for two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When baking cakes, do not place one pan directly below the other in the 
oven. For 50 servings, an average recipe will have to be made two times.

FOOD BRIEFS: ABCS OF FOOD SAFETY FOR CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A coalition of trade groups has created a food safety educational program for 
grade-school children. The effort, called "Play It Safe: Goals for Food 
Safety," was developed in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
and the American Academy of Pediatrics. 
</P>
<P>
The program is designed for students in grades four through six and attempts to 
define the role young consumers can play in ensuring a safe food supply. 
</P>
<P>
"Today with more dual-income families, greater numbers of children are 
preparing lunches, after-school snacks and family meals. The lesson plans 
stress the importance of safe food handling and preparation," the coalition 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
The program was distributed to 15,000 elementary schools earlier this year. The 
four-lesson plan discusses microbiological contamination, how to reduce 
food-borne illnesses and various government agencies' responsibilities in 
regulating the food industry. 
</P>
<P>
Among the groups sponsoring "Play It Safe" are the American Meat Institute, the 
National Fisheries Institute and the Food Marketing Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Battling 'Junk Food' -- A consumer group also has children's interests in mind 
with its announcement of a new nutrition campaign last week. 
</P>
<P>
The effort is being coordinated by the Center for Science and the Public 
Interest, a Washington-based advocacy group. Key elements of the "Children's 
Nutrition Campaign" will be to prevent manufacturers from promoting "junk food" 
to children and to challenge federal agencies to increase regulatory efforts in 
this area. 
</P>
<P>
"It's shameful that major companies are knowingly marketing junk foods to 
children," said Michael Jacobson, the center's executive director. "Just turn 
on Saturday-morning television and you'll see how the nation's cleverest 
marketing experts are taking advantage of 5-year-old children." 
</P>
<P>
The importance of such a program, according to the Center for Science, is to 
improve the overall health of America's children. The group, for instance, 
claims that obesity among young people increased by 54% in the past 20 years. 
Further, obesity in teens can increase the risk of heart disease, high blood 
pressure or diabetes in adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
The center also reported that high cholesterol levels are beginning to be seen 
in adolescents, a condition that can precipitate heart-related illness later in 
life. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign will single out those children's products it believes are not 
healthful. The group also plans on launching educational efforts on nutrition 
in schools. 
</P>
<P>
Upgrading Corn Chips -- One development that may even please the Children's 
Nutrition Campaign is a recent reseach report that indicates the protein levels 
of fried corn snacks, such as chips, can be doubled. 
</P>
<P>
The study, published by the Journal of Food Science, found that the addition of 
soybeans or garbanzo beans to these products "provided two times more protein 
than corn flour alone." 
</P>
<P>
The article, written by N.G. Almeida-Dominquez, claimed that "fried corn snacks 
popular among children and teens may soon be nutritious options for 
between-meal munching." 
</P>
<P>
Fortifying the snacks with soybean or garbanzo beans may be possible at the 
same manufacturing cost of current products or may even cost less, the journal 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Communicating Chemicals -- A federal agency is co-sponsoring a toll-free 
telephone number that offers callers information on pesticides 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, in conjunction with Texas Tech 
University, have launched the National Pesticide Telecommunications Network. 
According to a report in Nutrition Week, the line will be staffed by chemical 
specialists with backgrounds in agriculture, the environment or public health. 
The newsletter expressed hope that the hotline would disseminate "impartial 
information." 
</P>
<P>
The pesticide hotline is (800) 858-7378. 
</P>
<P>
Pesticide Correction -- A recent story on the United Fresh Fruit &amp; 
Vegetable Assn.'s annual convention incorrectly listed the percentage of 
pesticide residues being found on produce by federal health officials. 
</P>
<P>
The actual figure for 1988, or the last year for which data is available, 
indicated that the figure varied between imported and domestic produce. For 
instance, 49% of the domestic fruit sampled by FDA contained no residues versus 
58% of the imported fruit tested. Sixty-five percent of the domestically-grown 
vegetables were found to be free of pesticide residues compared to 60% of the 
imported samples. 
</P>
<P>
Illegal chemical levels were found in less than 1% of the domestic and imported 
produce analyzed. Less than 2% of the 14,336 items sampled were found to be 
technical violations, or showed evidence of a compound that was not approved 
for use on that particular crop. The remaining 40% to 50% of the total sample 
contained legal amounts of pesticide residue, according to the agency. 
</P>
<P>
The figure used in the Feb. 22 story indicated that 96% of the fruit and 
vegetables tested did not contain residues. However, this percentage applies to 
all foods tested by FDA, including meats, grains and seafoods as well as 
produce and includes those items that contained legal chemical residues as well 
as no detectable amounts.

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: COUCH POTATOES SHOULD GET MOVING FOR BETTER HEALTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is moving off the sofa to fill the snack bowl during commercial breaks your 
major form of exercise? If so, we can officially dub you a couch potato. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it doesn't bother you to be named after a tuberous vegetable and a piece 
of furniture, but perhaps this will: Scientific research shows that you have a 
good chance of dying sooner than your more active friends. 
</P>
<P>
A depressing thought, yes? But don't stop there. Despite your current sedentary 
habits, all is not lost. Results of an important new study in Dallas provide 
evidence that even moving a little goes a long way toward protecting your 
health. 
</P>
<P>
This study differed significantly from earlier models. Instead of trying to 
assess physical activity -- a difficult task to accomplish accurately, 
especially where large groups of people are concerned -- it measured physical 
fitness. Fitness, the product of both genetic makeup and physical activity, can 
be tested easily by performance on a treadmill. 
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 men and 3,000 women, all healthy, participated. Besides the 
treadmill test, each subject underwent a thorough medical evaluation and 
provided detailed background information. After eight years, researchers were 
able to account for an impressive 95% of the original group. Of those, 283 (240 
men and 43 women) had died. 
</P>
<P>
To probe the connection between death and physical fitness, subjects were 
grouped into five fitness levels. Naturally, more deaths (primarily from 
cardiovascular disease and cancer) occur among older subjects, but this was 
handled by dividing subjects according to age: 20 to 39, 40 to 49, 50 to 59, 
and 60 years or older. 
</P>
<P>
When this is done, risk of death among those who are least active is revealed 
as more than triple that of the most active men. Among least active women, the 
risk is more than 4.5 times as great. For older individuals, the difference in 
death rates is still more pronounced. These relationships hold true even after 
factors like blood cholesterol level, blood pressure, smoking, blood sugar 
levels and family history are accounted for. 
</P>
<P>
A closer look at the data shows something rather surprising: The greatest 
difference in risk occurs between people classified as least physically fit and 
the next 20% of subjects. In other words, if you can move just one rung up the 
fitness ladder, you'll be able to make real progress in improving your 
prospects for continued good health. 
</P>
<P>
So if you're starting at the bottom and you have nowhere to go but up, the next 
question is: How do you make it to that crucial next level? Based on their 
data, the researchers estimate that as little as a brisk walk of 30 to 60 
minutes a day is all that's needed. In other words, you don't have to undergo a 
personality change and turn into a aerobic or jogging fanatic to boost your 
health odds. You must merely become a pedestrian instead of a lounger. And if 
all unfit persons became fit, the death rate among men would fall an estimated 
9% and among women, over 15%. 
</P>
<P>
With this incentive, you'd think more Americans would get the message. Sadly, 
fewer than 10% of us over age 18 meet exercise goals set by the Public Health 
Service as Health Objectives for 1990. Nearly one in three is estimated to be 
sedentary. 
</P>
<P>
For the year 2000, the Public Health Service would like to see at least 30% of 
everyone six and older exercise vigorously enough to develop and maintain 
cardiorespiratory fitness three or more days a week for 20 minutes each. That 
seems a modest objective, and one with a major health payoff. 
</P>
<P>
But will we attain it? Experts at the Centers for Disease Control suggest we'll 
have a better chance of doing so if we beef up health-education programs in 
schools, from kindergarten through high school, and provide children with the 
motivation, knowledge and skills to lead a physically active life. They also 
believe that physicians should take more initiative in promoting physical 
activity, prescribing it as a specific component of treatment for their 
patients, and in leading community drives to upgrade programs in our schools. 
</P>
<P>
Physicians can, indeed, play a special role. But working to make America a 
physically fit nation again is a goal for us all. So couch potatoes of the 
world, arise. You can join in, starting today. 
</P>
<P>
All you need to do is put on some comfortable clothing and sturdy shoes -- and 
get up off that sofa. It will still be there after you come back from a 
vigorous, health-giving walk. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FDA Considers Aspartame Safe, but Sets Acceptable Daily Intake 
</P>
<P>
Question: I know aspartame is considered a safe artificial sweetener, but are 
there any guidelines defining acceptable intake? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Yes, and the margin of safety is extremely large. Based on available 
evidence, the Food and Drug Administration has established an acceptable daily 
intake (ADI) at just 1% of that which has been shown in animals and humans to 
have no toxic effect. The individual estimate is based on body weight. 
</P>
<P>
In a man weighing about 155 pounds, it translates to the amount you'd get in 
seventeen 12-ounce cans of soda artificially sweetened with aspartame. Studies 
show this is well above the daily level usually consumed. 
</P>
<P>
Q: A few years ago the subject of bulimia was constantly splashed across the 
cover of women's magazines. Lately I haven't seen anything about it. Has the 
problem subsided? 
</P>
<P>
A: At least one survey has suggested that the behaviors associated with bulimia 
may be on the decline. Researchers sound a note of caution, however, that 
bingeing and purging could be replaced by excessive exercise among those who 
are particularly dissatisfied with their bodies. 
</P>
<P>
When bulimia first emerged as a popular topic, original estimates of its 
prevalence may have been too high, since the criteria used to define it were 
overly broad. For instance, sometimes it was the existence -- but not the 
frequency -- of bingeing and purging that was measured. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking to discover whether these behaviors were on the decline, Craig Johnson, 
Ph.D., and his colleagues from Northwestern University repeated a survey 
conducted five years earlier with over 1,200 female high-school students. The 
second group included nearly 1,100. 
</P>
<P>
Good news first. In 1981, researchers found that 4.1% of the women met criteria 
for bulimia (and these criteria were somewhat broader than revised standards 
now used). In 1986, that figure had dropped to 2%. Significantly fewer students 
binged, used diet pills or reported that there were times when they couldn't 
stop eating. 
</P>
<P>
Concern about weight and the need to go on a diet had fallen as well. Fewer of 
the students believed they were overweight, or that their family and friends 
thought they were overweight. Fewer were on a diet and they felt less pressure 
from family and friends to start one. Scores on a psychological test that 
measures drive for thinness dropped too. This is all to the good. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the worrisome side. Scores on another psychological test that measures 
body dissatisfaction did not change. Dissatisfaction correlates with low 
self-esteem and personal ineffectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers suggest that some young women will seek other solutions to 
counter their perceptions, and that exercise in the "pursuit of strength" will 
produce a set of side effects related to exercise abuse. Obviously, those who 
are most vulnerable will exhibit the most severe symptoms. Whether the 
researchers' prediction is correct, or whether interventions to alter their 
prophecy can be developed, remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is fiber useful to individuals with irritable bowel syndrome? 
</P>
<P>
A: The jury's still out. Studies addressing the question have reached different 
conclusions, due both to problems in study design and to the variable nature of 
symptoms described as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). 
</P>
<P>
One recent study is of particular interest. The investigators, from McMaster 
University Medical Center in Ontario, Canada, used the so-called double-blind 
crossover. In this approach, neither investigators nor subjects know whether 
the fiber supplement or a placebo is being used, and all subjects are given 
supplements part of the time and a placebo for the rest of the time. This trial 
was extended over seven months, allowing time to examine longer term changes in 
symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
Over a six-month period, subjects were given four cookies daily, containing 
either corn fiber or a placebo for 12 weeks at a time. Each trial was separated 
from the next by a "washout" period to allow any effects to erode. Subjects 
were asked to score symptoms on a questionnaire as they entered the trial and 
at four-week intervals thereafter. Pressure measurements to assess changes in 
motility were also taken. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, several problems, including pain severity, frequency and consistency 
of bowel movements, and other abdominal symptoms improved over time both with 
corn fiber and the placebo. Pain in the lower left side was the most frequent 
symptom reported. And in this study, the "placebo effect" (the likelihood of 
reduced symptoms during periods when the cookies contained no bran) was 
greatest for pain. 
</P>
<P>
But the reduction in symptoms tended to erode over time. A drop in colon 
pressure with fiber intake did occur, but not to a significant degree. Perhaps 
one reason for the failure to demonstrate benefit is that fiber would be more 
effective in relieving constipation. However, only one-third of the subjects 
reported bowel movements less than twice a week. 
</P>
<P>
This was a small study. Only nine patients completed the entire trial, which 
lasted seven months. More research is needed to answer your question. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Recently a friend brought me a fruit called a pear-apple and I really 
enjoyed it. They are quite expensive and so will be only an occasional special 
treat, but I would like to know more about them. Are they a hybrid between a 
pear and an apple? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. While both their shape and color suggest they are relatives of golden 
delicious apples, botanically they are pears. Tottori, or 20th-Century Pears as 
they are called, were discovered growing wild on the northern coast of Western 
Japan at the turn of the century, and have since been cultivated. One feature 
of the King of Japanese Pears, as they are also sometimes called, is the 
painstaking care they receive as they grow. Blossoms are hand pollinated, and 
once the fruit begins to mature they are wrapped in wax-treated bags to protect 
them against insects and disease. 
</P>
<P>
Pears, to varying degrees, have a texture perhaps best described as a little 
gritty. It is contributed by lignin, a so-called "nonpolysaccharide" component 
of fiber. Tottori have a mild, aromatic pear flavor and, like other Oriental 
pears, a more-pronounced gritty texture than some varieties with which we are 
more familiar. A 3 1/2 ounce serving of pear-apple provides about 40 calories, 
but most of the fruits weigh considerably more than that.

COOK IT LIGHT: REDRESSING THE CLASSIC CAESAR SALAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNE JONES, Jones is a food consultant and a cookbook author. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though the Ides of March proved to be Caesar's downfall on March 15, 44 B.C., 
the salad bearing his name has been a year-round favorite ever since it was 
created by Caesar Cardini, an Italian restaurateur, in Tijuana in 1924. 
</P>
<P>
This version has far less cholesterol, since I use only the white instead of 
the whole egg called for in a classic Caesar salad. 
</P>
<P>
HAPPY HEART CAESAR SALAD 
</P>
<P>
2 heads Romaine lettuce 
</P>
<P>
2 cups garlic croutons 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup Happy Heart Caesar Dressing 
</P>
<P>
Several hours before serving, wash and dry lettuce thoroughly. Tear into 
bite-size pieces (there should be 16 cups) and place in large bowl lined with 
cloth to absorb any remaining moisture. Store in refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
When ready to serve, remove cloth from under lettuce and add dressing. Toss 
salad until every leaf glistens. Add croutons and again toss thoroughly. Makes 
16 cups, 8 (2-cup) servings. 
</P>
<P>
Each serving contains approximately:

<P>
2 teaspoons red wine vinegar 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese 
</P>
<P>
Using garlic press, squeeze garlic into oil in skillet over low heat. Cook just 
until garlic sizzles. Do not brown. Remove from heat and allow to cool. 
</P>
<P>
Add anchovy paste to garlic oil and mix well. 
</P>
<P>
Dip egg into boiling water for 30 seconds. Separate egg, discarding yolk. Add 
egg white to oil mixture. Blend well. 
</P>
<P>
Add pepper, lemon juice, Worcestershire, vinegar and Parmesan, mixing well. 
Store tightly covered in refrigerator. Makes 1/2 cup, 8 (1 tablespoon) 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Although many recipes call for uncooked eggs, the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture has found them to be a potential carrier of food-borne illness and 
recommends that diners avoid eating raw eggs. Commercial egg substitutes may be 
used in place of raw eggs in certain circumstances. Check egg substitute 
package for applications.

THE KITCHEN CABINET: LATEST DESIGNER TABLE LINENS ADD VISUAL APPEAL TO PLACE 
SETTINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MINNIE BERNARDINO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Crystal, china, silver, flowers, mood music and food -- they all are a part of 
the art of table setting. 
</P>
<P>
What's missing? Table linens, the touch that harmonizes the components into 
graceful softness. Here are a few examples to create a unique feeling for your 
next entertaining agenda. 
</P>
<P>
The bedroom or living room could be moving into the dining room, but when Bebe 
Winkler does it, the staging is executed in formal taste. When the highly 
regarded interior designer, a former fashion model, launched "Bebe's Home," a 
premier home collection of table-top accessories in the fall of 1988, place 
mats became "place palettes," tablecloths or overlays became "table shawls," 
while napkin rings became "fashion wraps." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Bebe Winkler collection of classic fringed and trimmed 
merchandise has grown from a three to 300-accessory line, going beyond table 
top to bed covers, elegant towels, decorative cushions and fashion shawls. 
Among the fabrics available are cotton, linen, rayon and damask. 
</P>
<P>
Cushions, trimmed with tassel ties or fringes, cords or French braids 
beautifully coordinating with table linens, play a great part in "Bebe's 
Table." Winkler says, "It's decorative cushions galore and the market is 
exploding. I use cushions in a formal dining room, and suddenly it says, 
'Hello, come here and sit down."' Another hot item for Winkler are tassel ties, 
which come in 11 fashion colors. "We've sold an incredible number of ties, 
thousands and thousands are being used to tie up those napkins." The fashion 
wraps or napkin rings include ruby and ivory rings, as well as onyx, tango 
lacquered wood and brass buckle. Winkler suggests using the brass buckle as a 
knife rest after the napkin is unwrapped. 
</P>
<P>
A persisting trend that's being extended to the entertainment table is 
recapturing Victorian atmosphere and the opulent 19th Century. Moving back to 
the periods of the flamboyant Medieval and Renaissance, Romantique to 
Provencal, CSI, Creations de France has come out with a large collection of 
French table draping. Representing the line in Los Angeles, Marlin Lim said, 
"The traditional look is back, tassels are in; customers get really excited 
when we trim tapestry tablecloths (like cushions) with borders, with tassel 
fringes and braided French cordings." 
</P>
<P>
Included in the CSI tablecloth line are elegant rectangular tapestry place mats 
-- featuring people, floral and scenery designs, some with borders; square 
tapestry tablecloths and runners, wool table scarfs with paisley patterns; and 
laminated cotton tablecloths with Provencal prints. Practical for outdoor use, 
the latter are moisture-proof and can be easily cleaned by just wiping with a 
damp cloth. 
</P>
<P>
"What's good with our tapestry tablecloths is that they are versatile. They are 
also designed as area rugs and work well for wall hangings with tassel cords," 
Lim added. 
</P>
<P>
A choice for many table textiles is the exquisite Jacquard, a loom with an 
endless belt of cards punched with holes arranged to produce a figured weave. A 
French company that has been producing good quality Jacquard linens since the 
mid-1800s is Le Jacquard Francais, distributed by Palais Royal in the United 
States. Still favored for elegant traditional settings are its classic white 
damask linens, intricately woven with luscious floral and line patterns. Color 
and a more casual approach has been recently introduced in the line, thanks to 
the works of Primrose Bordier, one of France's leading textile designers. 
</P>
<P>
There are three new Le Jacquard Francais Primrose Bordier patterns in 
innovative color shades against white weaving: the Planteur, a tropical themed 
tablecloth with pineapples, palm trees and parrots; the Oeillets tablecloth, 
featuring carnations, floral baskets and ribbons, and the Nautile kitchen towel 
(which doubles as a table runner), designed with a bowl of seashells and framed 
with a pretty border. 
</P>
<P>
Jacquard has been chosen by generations as an excellent table linen for its 
durability and quality. "We have very close quality control. The rate of return 
for anything damaged is extremely low," said Beth Villwock, customer service 
manager for Palais Royal. "People buy them because they know they're going to 
last. I haven't seen anybody wear anything out. I've seen the traditional white 
Jacquard passed down from three generations." A good example, she added, is a 
kitchen towel that she continually washes and irons. "The more you wash them 
the better they look," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Going back further in European history are images of Greek and Roman works of 
art imprinted on table scarfs, appropriate for those committed to architectural 
motifs. Expressed in black and white scheme with a contemporary feel, Timney 
Fowler's Scarf Range consists of 52-inch square soft wool challis and silk 
twill materials. Some of the design symbols are Nero, Compass, Clock, Aesop, 
Canimede, Pastoral, Bacchus, Aphrodite, Adam and Eve and Roman Statues. Part of 
the scarf collection is housed in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, in 
the 20th Century collection. The English manufacturer is represented by Gary 
McNatton at Mottura Showroom in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The popularity of Southwest decor has inspired many manufacturers to produce 
items for the table to carry out the theme. For Victoria Weaver, co-owner of 
Taos Mountain Wool in Arroyo Hondo, N. M., an innovative Mexican table-top 
accessory idea was developed out of a rejected sample material. Taos Tortilla 
Potholders and Place Mats, Taos Tacos Napkin Holders and Taos Taquitos Magnets 
were born out of wrinkled natural wool felt, which simulates tortilla color and 
texture. 
</P>
<P>
"We make wool quilt batting for quilters and take the yardage to a manufacturer 
in Montana," Weaver said. "One time, we had one batch that was wrinkled, so we 
cut a neck hole for a poncho. The round piece cut out looked so much like a 
tortilla so that's how it all started." 
</P>
<P>
What makes them more authentic looking are the burned spots. This was an 
afterthought, she said, which she achieved by scorching the items with a 
blowtorch. "We've had a lot of inquiries for theme parties and gift baskets; 
people are also using the napkin holders for favors," she added. Next, the 
company is working on making pastel colors as well as "blue tortillas." 
</P>
<P>
Glitter and glitz on the table was the glamorous route taken by Roberta Karsch, 
owner of Galerie Foil Collections, a company that manufactures hand-screened 
fabrics and accessories for the interior design trade. Creating an ambience of 
wealth and excitement, the home accessories encompass an extensive line of 
napkins, table overlays and underlays, fabric flowers, decorator cushions, 
hatboxes and shower curtains. Besides a border of tassels, the tablecloths may 
be finished with a rich thick piping or welting. All hand silk screened on 
either satin or bengaline materials, the print designs utilize Italian gold or 
silver foils or inks. They feature zebra, pony, leopard and paw prints. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the standard colors include white with gold, peach with gold, lilac 
with silver, smoke with silver and antique gold with copper. "We can customize 
them," Karsch said. "We can work with a client with color. The unique thing 
about it is that there is something for everyone, for every type of theme 
party." 
</P>
<P>
And finally for those who want to keep their setting "blanc on blanc," or white 
on white, the delicate pristine value of lace is unbeatable. Battenberg laces 
in white or ecru remain a popular choice for tea parties and brunch events. 
Today, there is an ever increasing range of designs available, not just for 
table overlays but for doilies, bread basket liners, runners and place mats as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
But no matter what table linens you choose to buy, whether to use over and over 
or for an occasional change of pace, don't let it stop there. Listen to Bebe 
Winkler's advise: "Have some fun; please don't set the table like you did last 
week, last month, or last night, even if it was just for two. Move it around. 
Don't be timid. Bring in accessories from your bedroom, from the living room. 
Take the bracelets off your wrist and make them into napkin rings, as I did." 
</P>

JURY TO GET PEARCE MURDER CASE TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The prosecutor in the Roberta Pearce murder trial admonished the jury Wednesday 
to convict the former teacher's aide of first-degree murder, saying the two 
teen-age boys who admitted killing her estranged husband had no reason to 
implicate her unless she had put them up to it. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at this case," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Tim Casserly, "it's a 
real simple one to analyze. There are two versions of what happened, and only 
one can be true. 
</P>
<P>
"Version One is that (Isaac) Hill and (Anthony) Pilato killed Mr. (Robert 
Wayne) Pearce because Mrs. Pearce asked them to," he said. "Version No. 2 is 
that, for some mysterious reason that we haven't figured out yet, they killed 
Mr. Pearce and decided to implicate Mrs. Pearce. But what would be their motive 
to do that? There is none. 
</P>
<P>
"If ever there was first-degree murder, this was first-degree murder," he said 
during nearly 2 1/2 hours of closing arguments to the Vista jury. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Roberta Pearce's defense attorney, Bill Fletcher, chipped away at 
what he said were inconsistencies by the three teen-age prosecution witnesses 
against his client, and at the end of his two-hour summary focused on the issue 
of reasonable doubt. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't agree with Mr. Casserly that the greatest travesty would be to let a 
guilty person off," Fletcher said. "The greatest injustice would be to convict 
an innocent person. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that things got out of control during those last two weeks 
in January," Fletcher said of the life style at Pearce's Valley Center home, 
where teen-agers congregated and partied -- and from where, the prosecution 
alleges, the woman hatched her murder plan. "But Mrs. Pearce is not charged 
with having sex (with a teen-ager) or smoking marijuana (with another), and 
those two things don't make her a murderer." 
</P>
<P>
The jurors are scheduled to begin deliberations this morning after receiving 
their final instructions from Vista Superior Court Judge Franklin J. Mitchell 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Pearce, 42, is charged with first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder 
and soliciting murder for the Jan. 31, 1989, stabbing death of her estranged 
husband, Robert (Wayne) Pearce, outside his Cardiff apartment. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office alleges that Hill and Pilato, who were both 15 
years old at the time, killed the construction worker at Roberta Pearce's 
behest, on the promise of each receiving $50,000 and a car. 
</P>
<P>
Hill and Pilato confessed to first-degree murder, have been sentenced to the 
California Youth Authority until they turn 25, and testified against Pearce. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Wayne Pearce was struck 27 times with a kitchen knife and a carpenter's 
hatchet as he left his apartment and was jumped by the teen-age assailants. He 
struggled back to his third-floor apartment, and was airlifted to Palomar 
Medical Center in Escondido where he died. 
</P>
<P>
If the jury convicts Roberta Pearce and finds the special circumstances that 
the murder was done for financial gain and after lying in wait, Pearce could be 
sentenced to death or to life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
Casserly acknowledged that the testimony by Hill and Pilato was inconsistent at 
times as to the sequence of events and dates but said their overall story was 
consistent and true to form virtually from the day of their arrests: that they 
were asked by Pearce to kill her estranged husband so she could collect his 
$200,000 life insurance policy and keep the couple's Valley Center home that 
otherwise would have been sold because of the couple's pending divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Pearce had testified on her own behalf that while she was angry at her husband, 
she didn't hire his killers. 
</P>
<P>
Her attorney argued Wednesday that the testimony of Hill, Pilato and a third 
teen-ager -- Mandy Gardiser, who had lived with Roberta Pearce for the two 
weeks prior to the killing and who testified against her -- were not to be 
believed. 
</P>
<P>
Among the issues during Wednesday's 5-hour session: 
</P>
<P>
* Fletcher argued that there were no signs of blood in Roberta Pearce's 
Lincoln, which the boys said they drove on the night of the killing. Casserly 
countered that Pearce had time to clean the blood that morning, before she 
drove to the hospital, where her husband died in surgery. Furthermore, she had 
her car commercially washed the following day -- an act that was inconsistent, 
he said, with a grieving widow unless she was trying to clean off incriminating 
fingerprints. 
</P>
<P>
* Casserly recalled testimony by Hill and Pilato that Pearce withdrew $300 in 
cash two days after the murder, to give to the two teen-agers who were hiding 
out in Tijuana. Fletcher countered that Roberta Pearce didn't have time that 
day, given some witness accounts, to drive to Tijuana to deliver the money -- 
and that for all anyone knew, her unsearched purse still had the money in it. 
</P>
<P>
* If his client was guilty, Fletcher asked, "Why didn't she run?" Answered 
Casserly, "Where would she go? Where would she hide? She has no place to run. 
There's another place to run -- to denial." 
</P>
<P>
* Fletcher argued that the prosecution witnesses implicated his client so they 
would receive generous treatment from a parole board. Casserly countered that 
Pilato and Hill had no reason to incriminate the woman, especially since they 
fully admitted their culpability to the tune of first-degree murder and weren't 
given leniency deals in exchange for their testimony. 
</P>
<P>
* Fletcher reminded jurors of testimony that Gardiser, who was 16 at the time, 
boasted at Orange Glen High School in Escondido that Robert Pearce had been 
killed, and that she spoke meanly about him. Of course she did, Casserly said; 
but because she didn't personally know the man, she clearly had been influenced 
by the very woman who wanted him dead -- Roberta Pearce. Furthermore, Gardiser 
is clearly out to tell the truth, he said, because she even admitted during 
testimony that she was under the influence of drugs when she testified against 
Pearce during her preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
* Fletcher contended that Roberta Pearce would have had more to gain 
financially if her husband was not killed because the couple's assets and debts 
would have been resolved more favorably to her in a divorce. Casserly responded 
that Fletcher was applying faulty numbers to his courtroom chart and, besides, 
it was unlikely that Roberta Pearce used a calculator and a ledger sheet in 
deciding whether to kill her husband. 
</P>
<P>
During his rebuttal, Casserly chided the defense for not answering the most 
significant question that might acquit Roberta Pearce: What were the boy's 
motives in killing Robert Wayne Pearce if it weren't at Roberta Pearce's 
solicitation? 
</P>
<P>
"When the defense gave its opening statement at the beginning of the trial, I 
thought, 'Oh good, now we're going to find out why Pilato and Hill killed Mr. 
Pearce,' " Casserly said. "But when we got to the opening statement, we didn't 
hear it. 
</P>
<P>
"When Mrs. Pearce testified, I thought, 'Now we'll find out why.' Well, she 
testified, and we still don't know. So I thought, maybe in the closing 
arguments we'll find out from the defense perspective why all this happened. 
</P>
<P>
"I've waited for that answer. I never heard it, and you've never heard it. And 
that's probably the most significant thing in this case: They (Pilato and Hill) 
had no motive to kill Mr. Pearce, unless they were hired." 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher said of Pilato's and Hill's testimony against his client, "They can't 
remember anything. Is that the strength of the testimony you convict someone 
for murder on?" 
</P>
<P>
"If you think she's probably guilty -- but you're still troubled by all the 
deception and lies that can't be reconciled," Fletcher concluded, "the law says 
you still must return a verdict of not guilty. You have to be convinced 100 
absolute percent." 
</P>
<P>
Casserly closed, "She doesn't want to accept responsibility. Certain people 
won't accept responsibility. You have to tell them, 'You are guilty, you are 
responsible.' "

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY URGED TO BUY SOUTHERN PACIFIC LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A coalition of environmentalists on Wednesday urged the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission to buy the Southern Pacific railroad's 14-mile Santa 
Monica branch line before developers grab the potential east-west transit 
corridor that connects the beach cities with downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The unused line runs from Santa Monica east along Exposition Boulevard past 
USC, a route environmentalist say could be used for light rail trains carrying 
up to 63,000 passengers a day. But some residents say they don't want commuter 
trains in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The line is one of several the commission is negotiating to buy from the 
Southern Pacific Transportation Co. and the Santa Fe Railway.

CHEMISTRY CHAIR AT UC IRVINE NAMED UCSD VICE CHANCELLOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chairwoman of the chemistry department at University of California, Irvine 
has been named vice chancellor for academic affairs at UC San Diego, a key 
position overseeing most faculty-related matters on the campus. 
</P>
<P>
Marjorie C. Caserio will succeed Harold K. Ticho, who is retiring under the UC 
statewide policy regarding retirement age. 
</P>
<P>
"We are extremely fortunate at UCSD that a person of Marjorie Caserio's 
academic caliber and leadership strengths has agreed to take on this key 
position," UCSD Chancellor Richard C. Atkinson said in announcing the 
appointment. 
</P>
<P>
The London-born Caserio began as assistant chemistry professor at UC Irvine in 
1965. From 1982 to 1984, she served as chairwoman of the UC Irvine Academic 
Senate, and chaired the full statewide UC Academic Senate from 1985 to 1986. 
She also served as faculty representative to the UC Board of Regents from 1984 
to 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Her research in chemistry centers on physical organic reactions, investigating 
the physical and chemical events that occur when organic material is 
transformed into another material. 
</P>
<P>
Caserio also chairs of the committee on professional training for the American 
Chemical Society, which sets guidelines for the teaching of chemistry at 580 of 
the nation's colleges and universities.

COUNTY TO KEEP SHELTERS OPEN UNTIL END OF APRIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By G. JEANETTE AVENT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unusually cold winter prompted county supervisors on Tuesday to set aside an 
extra $10,000 to keep San Diego County homeless shelters operating through 
April 30. 
</P>
<P>
The county uses the National Guard armories in Vista and El Cajon as shelters 
when overnight temperatures are forecast to drop to 35 degrees, or 40 degrees 
with rain. 
</P>
<P>
The two shelters have been open 82 nights since being activated on Nov. 29 as 
compared to 74 nights for the entire 1988-89 winter, said Leon L. Williams, 
chairman of the county Board of Supervisors. Last year, the shelters were 
closed in February. 
</P>
<P>
"The homeless deserve to be treated humanely, and the county does have the 
responsibility for the welfare of everyone in the region," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
The board has had to allocate $40,000 for the shelters, $15,000 more than last 
year, because there have been more nights with freezing temperatures and rain, 
said county spokeswoman Shirley Hulett. 
</P>
<P>
Under a contract with the county, the Salvation Army operates the East County 
program and North County Lifeline the North County program. The National Guard 
armories at 451 N. Pierce St. in El Cajon and at 150 Recreation Drive in Vista 
are normally used as shelters, Hulett said. 
</P>
<P>
This year 2,496 homeless people have used the shelters; 2,453 used the shelters 
last winter. Each armory can accommodate 200 people. 
</P>
<P>
Money to extend the program this year comes from federal grants for the 
homeless and for low-income residents, Hulett said. 
</P>
<P>
The county also provided $10,000 this year to the Interfaith Shelter Network, a 
coalition of 161 county churches which provide food and shelter for the 
homeless.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SHELTER FOR PROTECTION FROM MALATHION TO 
OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley directed city officials to open a recreation 
center in Watts Wednesday night for homeless people seeking shelter during 
malathion spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's action came after a 13-0 City Council vote authorizing a plan to open 
shelters in areas that are being sprayed to combat the Mediterranean fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who authored the motion, said that opening the 
centers, administered by the Parks and Recreation Department, was the "logical, 
simple and inexpensive thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
Helicopters were due to spray a 48-square-mile area Wednesday night, including 
Bell, Cudahy, Huntington Park, Lynwood, and parts of Athens, Bell Gardens, 
Commerce, Compton, East Los Angeles, South Gate, Vernon, Walnut Park and Watts.

LEUZINGER HIGH SECURITY CHIEF'S SON LED PROTEST; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: WALKOUT ORGANIZER SAYS RUMORS OF RACISM MADE HIM FEAR FOR HIS 
FATHER'S JOB. SCHOOL OFFICIALS PLAN TO MEET WITH STUDENTS TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Bert Best, the head of security at Leuzinger High School, worked frantically 
to herd protesting students out of the street and back onto campus this week, 
his son, Bert Best Jr., was explaining to the media how he and a handful of 
other students had organized the walkout. 
</P>
<P>
For the 18-year-old Best, the reasons for this week's protests in the Centinela 
Valley Union High School District were personal: He was a son sticking up for 
his father in the wake of rumors that black employees were in danger of losing 
their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Best said he had heard about the race-related incidents and rumors that have 
surfaced in the district this school year. One rumor was that Ken Crowe, the 
popular principal of Hawthorne High School, was on his way out. 
</P>
<P>
Crowe, one of two minority principals in the four-school district, announced 
his resignation last week after the school board told him that he would be 
reassigned. He changed his mind after the protests broke out. However, the news 
that the school board had taken action against Crowe surprised and frightened 
the teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
"I just know if (school board members) can get Ken Crowe, you can't be sure 
who's next," Bert Best Jr. said. "It could be my dad." 
</P>
<P>
The students who walked out of Leuzinger and Hawthorne high schools this week 
said they were frustrated by months of lingering rumors of racism, angered by 
Crowe's planned transfer and concerned about who could be next. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations were planned Sunday night at the home of the security chief 
and his son. 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm Ratliff, 17, one of the organizers, said he met with the younger Best 
and a few other friends to plan the protest and divide up duties Sunday night. 
About 400 flyers, some of them handwritten, were distributed Monday morning to 
notify students, he said, and the rest depended on word of mouth. 
</P>
<P>
Bert Best Jr. said he kept the protest a secret from his father because "I 
didn't know how he would feel." 
</P>
<P>
His father, who declined to say what he thinks of his son's involvement, said 
he found out about the walkout Monday morning along with other school 
officials. He said he was not involved in the protest and did not know anything 
about claims by some students that Leuzinger security guards urged them to join 
Monday's protest. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm supervisor of security," the senior Best said. "Why would I want a massive 
exodus of two to three thousand students causing chaos in this school?" 
</P>
<P>
Students launched the first protest at Leuzinger on Monday morning and then 
marched to Hawthorne High, where their numbers swelled to about 2,000. On 
Tuesday, about 500 students walked out of Leuzinger, while police officers 
prevented all but about 50 students from leaving Hawthorne High. 
</P>
<P>
School board members have repeatedly denied that the district intends to fire 
minority administrators and have called for the state Department of Education 
to look into the district's racial tension. 
</P>
<P>
But protest organizers maintain that the school board has not been open with 
the community. They were particularly upset Tuesday when the school board 
canceled a press conference called by Supt. McKinley Nash to air the students' 
grievances. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the school board agreed to meet with student representatives at 
the two campuses today. Nash said the meetings, to be closed to the press, will 
give students an opportunity to discuss their concerns with him, the board 
members and school principals. 
</P>
<P>
Nash said he expects no more walkouts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's over now. It's over," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers from several law-enforcement agencies were stationed at both campuses 
Wednesday but reported no disturbances. Hawthorne police, who had threatened 
students with arrest if they left the campus, referred eight Hawthorne High 
students to the truancy office Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
There were no arrests at Leuzinger. However, students later said that four 
demonstrators were suspended and about a dozen others were told to leave the 
campus for the rest of the day during a brief sit-in at Leuzinger on Wednesday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Student organizers said they were delighted that hundreds of students joined in 
their cause, but they reluctantly admitted that many were hangers-on who were 
using the walkout as an opportunity to skip class en masse. 
</P>
<P>
Ratliff estimated that only 25% of the hundreds of students who walked out of 
Leuzinger this week really understood what they were protesting. "For every 
serious protester, there are a few others who are just partying," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That alone was enough to keep some concerned students away. 
</P>
<P>
Yahira Silvera, a 15-year-old Leuzinger sophomore, participated in the Monday 
protest but decided to attend classes Tuesday. Silvera said she realized that 
many of the students were not serious about the protest when they walked out of 
a special assembly called Tuesday to discuss student concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"We had an assembly to talk it out, and most people didn't want to hear," 
Silvera said. "They wanted to get on TV or miss class." 
</P>
<P>
Security officials, who locked the gates at Leuzinger High on Tuesday to keep 
television cameras out, agreed that media attention played a role in egging the 
students on. 
</P>
<P>
When students ran out the front doors of Leuzinger on Tuesday morning, the 
guards said, they headed straight for the television cameras. 
</P>
<P>
One student said he was interviewed by the media six times Tuesday. Ratliff 
wore a suit to school Tuesday for his television appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Students had even mastered the language of the media. 
</P>
<P>
"Want a sound bite?" one protester yelled to a cameraman. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got the scoop," another added. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Bert Best Jr. said he was encouraged by the size of the protests 
and hopeful that the school board would address the students' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"Very few (student protesters) know what's going on," Best said. "Half of them 
are just out here missing class. But there are a lot of people that do 
understand. That's what matters."

STRING OF RACIAL INCIDENTS LED TO STUDENT WALKOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The incidents became more frequent about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
A mannequin of a dead black man, castrated and mutilated, was confiscated by 
school officials in April after it was displayed at Hawthorne High School. A 
black English teacher received a threatening note the same month after 
suggesting that the department's reading list include a minority author. 
</P>
<P>
Several months later, the leader of the predominantly white teachers union 
called the black superintendent of schools a "Stepin Fetchit," referring to a 
black actor in the 1930s who fawned over his white bosses. 
</P>
<P>
The flurry of racial unrest this week in the Centinela Valley Union High School 
District has been played out against a bitter backdrop of racial disharmony 
that teachers, students, parents and administrators say has haunted the 
district for years. 
</P>
<P>
There is little agreement over the source of ill will. Some blame bigotry among 
a handful of white teachers who dislike working under minority administrators 
in a district with an 80% minority enrollment. Others say it reflects strained 
race relations in society as a whole. Still others point the finger at school 
district politics. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, most agree there were telltale signs that racial problems at 
Hawthorne and Leuzinger high schools were barreling out of control long before 
2,000 students took to the streets Monday to protest the resignation of popular 
Hawthorne High School Principal Ken Crowe. 
</P>
<P>
There have been 40 alleged incidents of racial harassment -- involving 
administrators, teachers and students -- at the two schools during the past two 
years, district Supt. McKinley Nash said in an interview Wednesday. The 
incidents and other complaints cover a broad spectrum of allegations, including 
claims that teachers have referred to blacks in derogatory terms and have said 
they are intellectually inferior, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Crowe said the harassment began the day after he was promoted to principal in 
March, 1988, when a cartoon was anonymously circulated throughout the district 
depicting caricatures of blacks standing around a grave identified as Hawthorne 
High School. Later, Crowe said, he was approached by a teachers union 
representative, who told him some faculty members were unhappy because he is 
black. 
</P>
<P>
"How long can you fight this sort of thing?" asked Crowe, who said he decided 
to resign after being told that the school board planned to remove him. 
</P>
<P>
At least two white teachers have been officially reprimanded by the district 
because of racial incidents, and in three other cases teachers have had letters 
of complaint placed in their personnel files, according to a brief summary of 
incidents released by district officials. Cases are also pending against 
several other teachers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
One teacher was reprimanded for describing a black job specialist "as a spy for 
the superintendent," and another for using abusive language and threatening a 
black security official, according to the summary. The letters of complaint 
related to the use of abusive language by one teacher and harassment of 
administrators by two others. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the school board hired an attorney and a private investigator to 
look into many of the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
"There was very clear and strong evidence that there were some older white 
teachers in the school district who had a lot of resentment toward the changes 
that had taken place in the school district and that they were acting out a 
racially charged agenda with respect to students and staff," attorney Melanie 
Lomax, who conducted the investigation, said in an interview Wednesday. "The 
fact that they have a black superintendent (and other administrators) has not 
gone over very well." 
</P>
<P>
Lomax's investigation was interrupted by elections in November, which saw three 
of the board's five incumbents ousted. She said she presented her findings to 
the new board in January along with a warning that racial tensions were "not 
going to go away" and that the board should "not let this problem fester." 
</P>
<P>
Lomax said she further advised the board to take a strong public position 
deploring discrimination and racial harassment in the district and to ask an 
outside agency to conduct a districtwide investigation. "There was clearly too 
much smoke for there not to be any fire," Lomax said. 
</P>
<P>
That was not the first warning the newly elected board received. More than a 
dozen parents, educators and community leaders complained about racial tensions 
at a meeting in November when the three new board members were sworn in. 
</P>
<P>
Several speakers, most of whom were black, indicated that they would fight any 
effort by the new board to fire Nash or any minority administrators. During the 
election, two of the successful challengers were supported by the teachers 
union, which has repeatedly clashed with Nash, Crowe and other administrators.

CITY COUNCIL INCUMBENTS WIN EASILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Three Torrance City Council members easily won reelection Tuesday night in a 
race nearly lost amid the furor over hydrofluoric acid. 
</P>
<P>
Challenger Donald Pyles, a 35-year-old grocery checker, mustered 6,738 votes, 
or 14.2% of the ballots cast, to come in a distant fourth, losing to incumbents 
Bill Applegate, Dee Hardison and Mark Wirth. 
</P>
<P>
The slate of four council candidates was the most sparse in years, particularly 
in a city where as many as a dozen candidates sometimes vie for public office. 
</P>
<P>
Hardison, an education program coordinator who was running for her second term 
in office, duplicated her debut performance of four years ago by garnering the 
most votes citywide, 14,158, or 29.7%. 
</P>
<P>
Final tallies for Applegate and Wirth were separated by only 45 votes, with 
Applegate receiving 13,345 votes, or 28.1%, while Wirth claimed 13,300 votes, 
or 28%. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Katy Geissert, City Clerk John Bramhall and City Treasurer Thomas Rupert, 
all unopposed, also were returned to office. 
</P>
<P>
Geissert said her next four years in office will be her last because the the 
mayor is limited to two terms in office. She was first elected to the City 
Council in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Wirth, who garnered a solid second place four years ago, said he was perplexed 
as to why he trailed his council colleagues in this year's voting. One reason, 
he said, could be that voters were mistaking him for Councilman Dan Walker, who 
sponsored the hydrofluoric acid measure but who was not up for reelection this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people, as we walked precincts, their first reaction was, 'Oh, you're 
the council member whose name starts with a 'W' who has this thing on the 
ballot that I'm going to vote against,' " Wirth said. "I had to say, 'No, 
that's the other W.' . . . There were a lot of people who just were personally 
upset with the way (the measure) was handled.'

4 LEUZINGER STUDENTS GET SUSPENDED FOR WALKOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four student protesters at Leuzinger High School were suspended Wednesday 
morning for their participation in the mass walkouts at the school earlier this 
week, and about a dozen others were ordered off campus by school officials for 
the rest of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Students protesting alleged racism in the school district staged a brief sit-in 
on the Leuzinger campus Wednesday, but protesters said there was less 
participation than at two earlier protests this week because of threats of 
discipline by school officials. At Hawthorne High School, police said they 
referred eight students to the truancy office but described the situation as 
calm. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, hundreds of Leuzinger students marched to the Hawthorne High campus, 
where the number of demonstrators grew to about 2,000. There were reports that 
some demonstrators fought and vandalized property as they moved from Leuzinger 
to Hawthorne. Smaller protests were reported at both campuses Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the protests, the school board agreed Wednesday to meet with 
students at both campuses today. 
</P>
<P>
A group of about 20 Leuzinger students, however, expressed skepticism Wednesday 
that the meetings would accomplish anything and said they were planning a 
boycott of classes today. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters, who arranged a press conference at Ramona Park after school to 
announce their plans, said they will meet students as they arrive for school 
this morning and urge them to return home to support the protest of alleged 
racism in the Centinela Valley Union High School District. 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm Ratliff, a senior who received a five-day suspension for "campus 
disruption," accused Leuzinger officials of "hoping to calm the Indians by 
taking away all the chiefs." He said removing a few protest leaders from the 
campus would not quell the protests. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Fortune, another student protester, said security guards tackled him to 
the ground as he ran away from them during Wednesday's sit-in. His suspension 
form accused him of "willful defiance of authority."

'SUMMIT' ON SANTA CLARITA SCHOOLS DISINTEGRATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A second education "summit" to address classroom crowding in the Santa Clarita 
Valley came to an abrupt halt Wednesday, leaving school officials and Los 
Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich accusing each other of lacking 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the meeting was over -- roughly 15 minutes after it began -- 
Antonovich, school officials and developers were frustrated and angry. 
</P>
<P>
"You guys have the problem. I'm just trying to resolve it," Antonovich told 
builders and school officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We had better things to do this morning," said Pat Willett, a trustee of the 
Newhall School District. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's gathering was a follow-up to a Feb. 8 meeting, organized by 
Antonovich, that included school superintendents, developers and state 
education officials. The aim, Antonovich said, was to air possible solutions to 
classroom crowding in the fast-growing valley. 
</P>
<P>
School districts and developers in the Santa Clarita Valley -- and across the 
state -- have been at odds for months over how much developers should pay to 
build schools. The crisis has prompted a variety of bills in the Legislature 
that would raise money for school construction. 
</P>
<P>
At the Feb. 8 meeting, Antonovich asked the developers and school officials to 
meet and decide which bills they -- and the county -- should support. A united 
front of builders, school districts and county officials would carry more 
weight in Sacramento, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But when Antonovich asked the builders and school officials for the results of 
their meeting Wednesday, they looked back at him in confusion. 
</P>
<P>
"If it happened, Mike, it was a well-kept secret," said Scott Brown, 
superintendent of the Castaic Union School District. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there was a meeting," said Gary Cusumano, chief operating 
officer of the Newhall Land &amp; Farming Co., the area's largest developer. 
</P>
<P>
Builders and school officials said they had not understood Antonovich's 
request. Each side had considered the legislative issues separately, but not 
together. Antonovich, obviously baffled by the news, chastised the builders and 
school districts. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed that the two groups did not get together," he said. The two 
sides were supposed to devise a funding strategy the county could support, 
Antonovich said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping that the leadership would come from here," he said, referring to 
the superintendents, trustees and developers who had gathered in a meeting room 
at the county Hall of Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The developers and school officials agreed to meet next Wednesday and present 
Antonovich with a list of recommendations next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But school officials also said the meetings were a waste of time because 
Antonovich, rather than trying to solve the school crowding crisis at the 
county level, was trying to direct all efforts towards Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"If what we're supposed to do is go meet with developers and solve our 
problems, we don't need him," said Newhall School District Superintendent J. 
Michael McGrath. The county contributes to school crowding by approving 
developments and should move to solve the problem, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's abdicating the responsibility the county should take," McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a year, the five Santa Clarita Valley school districts have 
unsuccessfully lobbied the Board of Supervisors to reject developments which 
they insist will overburden their school systems. The supervisors say state law 
prevents them from denying development proposals just because they might 
adversely affect schools. 
</P>
<P>
As Antonovich left the meeting room, he was challenged by Willett, who said he 
-- not the school districts -- was showing a lack of leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm concerned about the productivity of coming down here to be told 'Solve 
your problems,' " Willett said. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich said he was trying to help the schools and added that state law 
clearly makes schools a state, and not local, responsibility.

TUTORS OFFER SAFETY NET FOR ADULT STUDENTS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: A VOLUNTEER PROGRAM IS HELPING TO KEEP THE CLASSROOM SETTING FROM 
BEING AN OVERWHELMING EXPERIENCE TO THOSE WHO RETURN TO LEARN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A 29-year-old San Diego man who had gotten by with minimal reading skills all 
his life failed to realize he had a problem until three years ago, while 
looking for a job. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know that I couldn't read until my wife told me," he said. "My wife 
always filled out job applications for me and wrote out checks. I thought I 
read enough to get by. I could write my name." 
</P>
<P>
But when the unemployed student from Jamaica tried to get a job as an 
electrical assemblyman, he discovered from test scores that he was reading on a 
first-grade level. The student, who asked that his name not be used, enrolled 
in a reading class at one of San Diego Community College District's continuing 
education centers. 
</P>
<P>
But often, when adults enroll in a basic education class and find that their 
skills are far below those of the other students in the class, they drop out, 
said Nancy Hampson, coordinator of the Literacy Instruction Tutors in 
Education, a program started in 1987 by the San Diego Community College 
District to keep these students learning. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes great courage for people who can't read to enroll in a class, and 
find that their skills are far below the other students in the class," Hampson 
said. "They feel embarrassed, frustrated and defeated. They drop out after a 
few sessions with the impression that an adult education class is another place 
of failure." 
</P>
<P>
The literacy volunteer program has become a safety net for those like the 
Jamaican student, she said. The individualized instruction allows students to 
improve basic reading, spelling, and math skills without feeling like outcasts 
in a classroom of strangers. Most of the students were also high-school 
dropouts. 
</P>
<P>
The district started the LITE program with six volunteers. Today, there are 
nearly 150 volunteers who serve about 318 students at eight of the 10 
continuing adult education centers in the county. 
</P>
<P>
LITE is the only adult tutoring program in the county. It is a branch of the 
San Diego County Literacy Network, which is a coalition of 13 adult literacy 
programs. LITE is funded by a three-year, $60,000 allocation from California 
lottery funds. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers receive 12 hours of training. Afterward, they choose which students 
they want to tutor, based on the students' learning capabilities. Some tutors 
may meet with as many as five students a week. 
</P>
<P>
"I've obtained confidence from my teacher," said a 67-year-old student who also 
asked that his name not be used. "I took the driver's test and did good. I got 
100. When I first came, I could read some but couldn't write unless I copied 
it. I wanted to read some good books, to read recipes, so I could cook." 
</P>
<P>
He said he was promoted throughout grade school without learning how to read 
and write. He was embarrassed and hid the fact that he could not read around 
the other children because he thought he was too dumb to learn. 
</P>
<P>
The retired janitor was also "too embarrassed to marry or have children" 
because he could not read or write. 
</P>
<P>
For two years, he said, he kept applying for a janitor's position at San Diego 
State University, where he eventually worked for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
"The boss kept telling me, 'I told you I don't have anything,' and I kept 
saying, 'You don't understand, I want a job.' I finally told him that if I 
couldn't handle the job, then I would leave. I did everything but beg." 
</P>
<P>
Jenny Hartman, who tutors the ex-janitor, says helping people like him is what 
makes the task worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
"He's enthusiastic and wants to learn," Hartman said. "He has made a great deal 
of progress, and has gained a lot of confidence. One day he saw a sign on the 
board and read it aloud. A year ago he couldn't read. Now he reads Dickens." 
</P>
<P>
Half of LITE's volunteers work with students who perform on levels from 
preschool to eighth-grade. The other half help students studying English as a 
second language, and students preparing for the GED high-school equivalency 
diploma. 
</P>
<P>
Dale F. Lovell, 78, is a retired teacher who volunteers 6 hours a week just for 
fun. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it, it keeps me going," he said. "Enjoyed teaching all my life." 
</P>
<P>
Lovell, who taught for more than 50 years, has been a tutor for four years. He 
said that most of his students never learned to read in grade school and are 
ashamed to admit it. 
</P>
<P>
One of his students, 46-year-old Ar Mark, is learning survival English. She 
came to the United States three years ago from Cambodia. Mark takes care of her 
husband who suffers from asthmatic problems. 
</P>
<P>
Paula Cervantes, 47, did field work in Texas and never went to school. She said 
that she plans to get her GED and hopes to learn English well enough to become 
a Spanish-English translator. 
</P>
<P>
Anita Whelan, an instructor for the reading development class, said that her 
students read on preschool through third-grade levels. She said that most of 
the students want to learn how to read to get better jobs, or to get the 
education they did not get in grade school. 
</P>
<P>
As for measuring the program's success, Hampson says that is difficult because 
most of the students have their own goals, Hampson said.

"About 33% get frustrated and drop out, never meeting their goals, and 66% meet 
their goals and go on to the classroom program when they're ready for more 
independent learning. Some only want to learn how to read to get a driver's 
license, and then they drop out," she said.

REDONDO PIER MAY BE ON JUNE BALLOT AFTER ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
The advisory question of whether and how to rebuild the Redondo Beach pier -- 
which the city had wanted to place on the regular June ballot and then decided 
to ask in a special election -- will be submitted for the June ballot after 
all, the City Council decided Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Brad Parton, who earlier had warned the council that there might not be 
room for the pier question on the primary ballot, said Tuesday that it appeared 
that state and county initiatives and candidates would take up less ballot 
space than had been expected. 
</P>
<P>
About half the pier was destroyed in 1988 after a series of storms and a 
massive fire. The City Council had decided to rebuild it immediately, but the 
council's resolve faltered in the face of opposition from the pier's neighbors, 
who contended the landmark looked tacky and attracted street gangs and various 
riffraff. 
</P>
<P>
In January, a Torrance Superior Court judge ruled that, under the city's 
contract with pier businesses, Redondo Beach was obligated to rebuild the pier. 
But the ruling didn't come until after a majority of the council members had 
made campaign promises to put the pier issue to a popular vote. 
</P>
<P>
So in the wake of the ruling, the council has decided both to appeal the 
decision and to ask the voters whether to rebuild the pier. The ballot question 
will also ask those who approve of rebuilding the pier if the original mix of 
businesses should be retained and whether the city should contribute general 
fund money to the project. 
</P>
<P>
The questions will be submitted to the county registrar-recorder for placement 
on the June ballot, the council decided Tuesday. But because advisory questions 
have last priority on crowded ballots, the council also decided to put the 
mechanism in place for calling a special election sometime this year, if the 
pier question cannot be squeezed in next June. 
</P>
<P>
That special election, the council decided, would also include a number of 
proposed City Charter changes, among them a proposal to lift the current 
two-term limit for council members and the mayor.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Normal Heights man was released Wednesday from County Jail downtown, where he 
was being held on suspicion of raping a slightly retarded 22-year-old woman who 
was reported missing Feb. 26, police said. Detective Robert Hilliker said 
charges of raping an incompetent were dropped against 26-year-old Richard 
Wallington, because the alleged victim, Lisa Louise Butler, did not want to 
prosecute. 
</P>
<P>
"She told us that she wasn't missing, and that it was her choice to go with 
(Wallington) because she was doing her own thing," Hilliker said. 
</P>
<P>
Butler, who police were told has the mental capacity of a 9-year-old, met 
Wallington at a downtown bus stop and went to his home in the 3000 block of 
Suncrest Drive, where she stayed all last week, said police spokesman Bill 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
An official at a supervised home in Southeast San Diego, where Butler lives, 
reported her disappearance to police, who alerted the local media. Her picture 
appeared in some newspapers and television news programs. 
</P>
<P>
Hilliker said police interviewed Butler and determined she was capable of 
making her own decision about staying with Wallington. He said there was 
insufficient evidence of Butler's retarded mental condition. 
</P>
<P>
Butler was found Monday in a Burger King restaurant at Fashion Valley, Robinson 
said. He said that a man who had worked with Butler in a Special Olympics event 
recognized her from media reports and told an employee to call police. 
</P>
<P>
Wallington is employed at the fast-food restaurant and Butler was waiting for 
him to finish work.

VICTIMS IDENTIFIED IN CRASH OF CAR, DISABLED GAS TANKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Authorities identified Wednesday the three people who were killed when a car 
slammed into the back of a stalled truck on the Golden State Freeway in Sun 
Valley. The cause of the crash, which also injured four others, remained 
unknown. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol said Edgar Sandoval, 32, Blanca Sandoval, 31, and 
Luis Montalvo, 28, all of Los Angeles, were killed at 9:45 p.m. Monday when the 
car Edgar Sandoval was driving crashed into the back of a gasoline tanker 
truck, which was stalled on the side of the northbound lanes of the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Three children and a fourth adult were injured. Manuel Sandoval, 6, and Edgar 
Renado, 4, were reported in stable condition at Childrens Hospital in Los 
Angeles. Alexis Sandoval, 9, was reported in stable condition at Pacifica 
Hospital of the Valley in Sun Valley. The condition of a 35-year-old man, whose 
name was not released, was unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe that Edgar and Blanca Sandoval may have been married and 
that the injured youngsters could be their children, but no family members have 
been located to confirm their relationship, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Tami Low said the group had been at a restaurant earlier in the evening 
and that Edgar Sandoval had been drinking alcohol. However, an autopsy to 
determine whether he was drunk at the time of the accident had not been 
completed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Low said the driver had a pocketful of bullets and two pairs of handcuffs in 
the car but it was not known why. No weapons were in the car, and investigators 
had not determined Sandoval's occupation, she said.

1 DIES IN CRASH WHEN DRIVER FALLS ASLEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A sleeping woman died Wednesday when the driver of the car in which she was 
riding also fell asleep at the wheel along the Ventura Freeway in Woodland 
Hills, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, whose name was not released pending notification of relatives, was 
thrown from the back seat of the car after it sailed more than 30 feet through 
the air and landed on Shoup Avenue, said Officer Dennis Yates of the California 
Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, Amador Racine, 38, of Canoga Park was wearing a seat belt and 
suffered minor injuries. He was taken to Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in 
Woodland Hills, where he was treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
Yates said Racine was driving east on the freeway about 11:02 a.m. when he 
dozed off and lost control of the car. The vehicle swerved onto the right 
shoulder, then back into traffic lanes, before flying off the freeway, Yates 
said.

WOUNDED WOMAN ARRESTED IN HUSBAND'S SLAYING IS FREED

<P>
A Simi Valley woman suspected in the shooting death of her husband was released 
Wednesday because investigators said they were unsure how the man was killed. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Fortunato, 29, was found shot to death in the couple's home in the 
1100 block of Hudson Court at 6 a.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Officers were called to the home by a neighbor after the victim's wife, Kari 
Fortunato, 31, ran to the neighbor's home and asked them to call for help, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Tony Harper said Kari Fortunato, who was covered with blood, was taken to 
Simi Valley Adventist Hospital, where she was arrested on suspicion of slaying 
her husband. At the hospital, it was determined that she had gunshot wounds in 
both hands and on the top of her head. 
</P>
<P>
She was reported in stable condition at the hospital Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the couple were arguing inside their house before the shooting. 
Christopher Fortunato was found in a hallway, shot in the head. A handgun 
believed to have been used in the shooting was found in the home. 
</P>
<P>
After the shooting, Kari Fortunato declined on the advice of an attorney to 
talk with investigators about what had happened, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of her wounds, the lack of witnesses and other information about the 
shooting, detectives on Wednesday decided not to seek a murder charge against 
Kari Fortunato, Harper said. He declined to speculate whether Christopher 
Fortunato could have been shot by his wife or if she may have been injured 
while trying to prevent his suicide. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not yet determined what happened," Harper said. "We don't know whether 
we have a homicide or suicide. We still have more work to do on this."

ARMENIAN GENOCIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mitchell Daniels' column on the Armenian genocide (Op-Ed Page, Feb. 23) was 
nothing more than a piece of pro-Turkish propaganda from a man who, as you 
phrase it, "just returned from a trip to Turkey." 
</P>
<P>
If 1.5 million Armenians were not butchered by Daniels' pals, the Turks, could 
he then tell us what has happened to 1.5 million innocent people? He says that 
"most were casualties of war, not of pogroms"; a worn-out contention refuted by 
hundreds of eyewitnesses, many of whom were not even Armenians (Arnold Toynbee, 
George Horton, etc.) 
</P>
<P>
. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels also tells us that the Turks themselves have been victims of pogroms, 
and he gives as examples Cyprus in the 1970s and "Bulgaria and Thrace at this 
very moment." Well, I do not know about Bulgaria (except that they are giving 
the Turks some of their own medicine) but I do know about Cyprus and Thrace, 
and, thereby, must hasten to say that Daniels is ignorant of the facts and 
unconscionable in his statements. What pogrom against the Turks occurred in 
Cyprus is beyond me or anyone who has followed the modern history of Cyprus. 
What pogroms are taking place in Thrace is also beyond me, and I keep abreast 
of the news from there on a daily basis. Not one Turk has been killed in 
Thrace. 
</P>
<P>
The Turks have a long history of oppressing minorities, as Greeks, Kurds, 
Bulgarians, Armenians and Jews will tell you. No obfuscating propaganda and 
distortion can alter that fact, and Daniels' opinion that there was no Armenian 
genocide is similar to the one that claims that there was no Holocaust. The 
difference between these two assertions is that Daniels would be afraid of the 
repercussions if he were to assert the latter.

Daniels certainly zeroed in on the major problems passage of resolution would 
cause for U.S.-Turkish relations. 
</P>
<P>
Far from redressing an alleged human rights violation 75 years ago, it would 
fan ethnic hatreds as both Turks and Armenians recall the civil warfare. 
</P>
<P>
If this resolution is what our senators find in the best interests of the U.S. 
and for human rights, they are either hopelessly naive and ill-informed or 
completely caught up in double standards in which the Turkish dead are to be 
condemned and the Armenian dead are to be commemorated. You performed a service 
in printing this article for the public to see how the Senate spends its time.

Daniels apparently feels that America should not trifle with Turkey's 
sensibilities by recognizing the Armenian genocide. This attitude of willful 
neglect of moral responsibility for short-term political gain sells America's 
soul for immediate foreign policy gratification. Daniels should not forget that 
Turkey could easily go the way of Iran as a strategic ally while the Armenian 
genocide will remain a historical fact forever.

The U.S. Senate rejected the resolution which would have commemorated the 75th 
anniversary of the Armenian genocide at the hands of the Ottoman Turks (Part A, 
Feb. 28). While Armenians are used to adversity, this latest rejection in our 
American home really hurt. 
</P>
<P>
The dagger was given a little extra twist. How? 
</P>
<P>
1. Presidential candidate George Bush in the fall of 1988 promised to 
acknowledge and support the resolution. As President, however, Bush changed his 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
2. Americans of Armenian ancestry and their friends asked Bush and the Senate 
for a commemorative resolution, but Turkey shouted down this request. U.S. 
taxpayer dollars and U.S. corporations doing business in Turkey provided the 
financial support for the lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
3. When you have corporate America, the U.S. State Department and the Turkish 
government sharing the same rumpled bed, well, under those conditions how would 
anyone find time to read the morality and ethics handbook?

'YOUNG AND TENDER' -- JAILHOUSE PREY; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: JAIL OVERCROWDING HAS CREATED A CLIMATE OF CRIME, ESPECIALLY AGAINST 
YOUNG MEN AWAITING TRIAL. BUT THE COURTS DENY THEIR RIGHT TO PROTECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Are Californians who await trial in overcrowded jails no longer protected from 
cruel and unusual punishment by the U.S. Constitution? 
</P>
<P>
Clifton Redman was an immature-looking 18-year-old in 1983, detained on 
suspicion of auto theft, when they brought him into the mainline tank of the 
South Bay jail in San Diego. He first had been placed in a "young and tender" 
unit for protection from hardened criminals. But after a few days he was 
transferred to a one-man cell with Kevin Clark, an "aggressive homosexual," 
according to court records. Clark, a 27-year-old ex-con, had just been 
transferred from a homosexual unit after attacking men for sexual favors. 
</P>
<P>
That night Clark raped Redman. Brandishing a knife fashioned from a sharpened 
toothbrush, he ordered Redman not to walk bowlegged or otherwise reveal that he 
had been sexually assaulted. If Redman "squealed," Clark threatened to get 
someone on the outside to attack Redman's 16-year-old girlfriend. Clark had 
discovered her address on an envelope. 
</P>
<P>
Filled with "pain and hatred, I can't describe it," Redman called his 
girlfriend. Her mother called the jail and warned about the threat made to 
Redman. A guard replied that jailers weren't running "a baby-sitting service," 
she later testified. Subsequently, another guard quizzed Redman about his 
problem in full view of other inmates. Afraid for his girlfriend's safety and 
his own if he "squealed" in front of the others, Redman said there was no 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
That night he was gang raped by three men, including Clark. He was raped again 
by Clark the next day, before being released from jail. Subsequently, all three 
inmates pleaded guilty to the assault. 
</P>
<P>
Redman later sued the government and his jailers for "depriving him of his 
constitutional right to personal security under the due process clause of the 
14th Amendment." He also raised the issue of whether he had been subjected to 
cruel and unusual punishment. 
</P>
<P>
A jury trial was held. But the San Diego County Counsel asked for a "directed 
verdict." This is a procedural device that effectively takes the case away from 
the jury and leaves it for the judge to decide. 
</P>
<P>
The judge denied culpability on the part of the county and the jailers. Redman 
appealed for a jury to decide his case. 
</P>
<P>
Now, seven years after the rape, a panel of three judges on the federal 9th 
Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld the lower court. Judge David R. Thompson 
affirmed the ruling that no "reasonable jury" could conclude that Redman had 
been treated with "reckless indifference or with callous disregard." 
</P>
<P>
No jury, indeed. Thompson's callous ruling shows reckless indifference to the 
rights of all innocent people awaiting trial in California's critically 
overcrowded jails. It doesn't take a constitutional lawyer to see that this 
18-year-old was raped by the system. And after he complained, the system stood 
by and let him be raped again and again. And then it turned its face away and 
said no, the American people are not allowed to sit in judgment of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Thomas Tang dissented strongly. 
</P>
<P>
"A reasonable jury could have found," he wrote, noting the cumulative effect of 
the evidence, "that Redman's jailers knew he was vulnerable to sexual assault, 
knew of Clark's proclivity to assault others sexually, knew Redman had received 
threats, knew Redman feared reprisal if he complained, and knew that 
questioning Redman in front of other inmates could serve only to increase 
Redman's peril and compel him to keep silent. . . . Indeed, the jury could have 
concluded that Redman's jailers were deliberately indifferent to the imminent 
danger of Redman's rape." 
</P>
<P>
The indifference of jailers to the peril of inmates in overcrowded jails across 
the country has now been justified by the Thompson ruling. It is not enough to 
be warned of a possible assault. The jailer has to know for a fact that an 
assault will happen -- to be clairvoyant -- to be held accountable. 
</P>
<P>
Accountability is all the more crucial as the jails become more dangerously 
overcrowded. The South Bay jail was built to house 192 men. In 1983, it held 
300 men, which explains why Redman and Clark were forced to bunk up in a cell 
designed for one man. Today, South Bay holds 875 men -- 456% over capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Major jails in this country are 105% over capacity, the National Institute of 
Corrections says. California's jails, among the most crowded in the nation, are 
134% over capacity. On a recent day in Orange County, 4,400 inmates were 
crowded into jails rated for 3,199. The Los Angeles County jail system, built 
for 13,464 prisoners, averages more than 22,000. 
</P>
<P>
No jailer can handle these numbers adequately without imperiling the rights of 
all inmates. Especially vulnerable are young, first-offense detainees who have 
not been convicted of any crime. They may be innocent until proven guilty in 
the eyes of the law. But in the eyes of hardened cellmates, they are "young and 
tender" and in bondage. 
</P>
<P>
Jail violence certainly doesn't serve as a crime deterrent. Redman, punished 
but never tried, went on to commit other crimes. He was certainly not 
rehabilitated by being gang raped as his first experience in the criminal 
justice system. 
</P>
<P>
The jails are a microcosm of a lock-'em-up-and-throw-away-the-key society 
overwhelmed by violence. In the jails, even more than on the mean streets, the 
law abdicates responsibility to the most violent criminals and the most passive 
wardens. In the American system of injustice it is the prisoners who mete out 
punishment. And the judges stand by the jailers who look the other way when a 
young man is punished by rape before trial -- and, in the era of AIDS -- 
potentially given a death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"Juries encompass the wealth of community experience," writes Judge Tang, 
eloquently defending the right of a jury to decide community standards for 
detention in the county jails. 
</P>
<P>
The full 10-member appellate court should reconsider this ruling made by only 
three of its members. And a jury should decide whether Redman's rights were 
violated. Jailers must be held accountable for protecting the rights of inmates 
in their total control. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless there's room in the law to protect individuals, we may all suffer," 
says Redman's persistent attorney, William D. Daley. "This could be your son, 
your brother -- it could be you."

DOLLARS TO SETTLEMENTS, DOLLARS LESS IN AID; 
</P>
<P>
ISRAEL: AMERICA SHOULD BE PREPARED TO CURTAIL ASSISTANCE THAT FREES A RECIPIENT 
TO APPLY OTHER FUNDS FOR PURPOSES UNACCEPTABLE TO US. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALTON FRYE, Alton Frye is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign 
Relations. His commentary draws on testimony he gave last week before the House 
foreign operations subcommittee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the Middle East, a fragile peace process struggles toward honest dialogue 
between Israelis and Palestinians. In Washington a vulnerable foreign-aid 
program struggles for funds amid a ferocious budget scramble. Secretary of 
State James A. Baker III proposes to link the two in a way that deserves 
support: Make clear to our Israeli friends that future U.S. assistance will be 
affected adversely by additional Israeli settlements in the occupied 
territories of the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
As a general proposition, the United States needs to eliminate contradictions 
between foreign-assistance allocations and larger policy objectives. Usually it 
is wise to respect the sovereign preferences of states with whom we have 
assistance relationships. However, where those preferences collide with vital 
American interests, it is absurd not to defend our stake. That is now the case 
in the visible tension between the U.S. commitment to Israeli-Palestinian 
negotiations and Israel's persistence in creating new "facts" on the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
We should be prepared to curtail assistance that frees a recipient to apply 
other funds for purposes unacceptable to us. This principle applies with 
particular force to the Middle East, where Israel and Egypt consume the largest 
share of U.S. economic and military assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Courage and skill are needed to enforce this principle in a setting so volatile 
and so burdened with the barnacles of history. The delicate diplomacy now at 
work in the Middle East poses unique demands on the American political system, 
no less than on the parties directly involved. One of the gravest threats to 
that diplomacy is the extension of Israeli settlements. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has condemned such settlements. Now there are new 
complications arising from the fear that the expanded flow of Soviet emigres -- 
a flow that the United States has sought for more than a decade and for which 
Israel yearns -- would encourage further settlements. That fear has persuaded 
the Soviets to delay an arrangement for direct flights to Israel, thus slowing 
the exodus for many Jews anxious to begin a new life. 
</P>
<P>
Confrontation with a friend is never congenial, but a sharper line now seems 
necessary. American policy has already addressed this problem by requiring 
foreign-assistance contracts to prohibit certain expenditures on the West Bank. 
If Israel persists in investing in settlements on the West Bank, the United 
States should make clear that it will adjust assistance levels by comparable 
amounts. A dollar spent on settlements, whatever its source, should mean a 
dollar less in U.S. assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional willingness to help provide housing and other assistance for the 
thousands of Soviet refugees making their way to Israel is laudable, but not if 
it frees Israel to underwrite provocative settlements in the occupied 
territories. The question for U.S. policy must be: Does our assistance bolster 
or weaken the peace process? This is a case where we must apply linkage if 
policy is to be coherent. 
</P>
<P>
Heirs of the Judeo-Christian heritage should not be subsidizing violations of 
the Eighth Commandment. Transactions under military occupation are 
intrinsically coercive. As Nelson Mandela observed, only a free man can 
negotiate; so, too, land transfers in the West Bank today are inevitably 
tainted by the unequal status of the occupied and the occupiers. 
</P>
<P>
President Dwight D. Eisenhower faced a similar tough call in 1956 when he 
preserved the nation's moral leadership by dissociating the United States from 
the invasion of Suez. If we cannot persuade Israel to alter its settlements 
policy, then the United States must distance itself from that policy or lose 
all credibility as an honest broker for peace. Unless that posture is reflected 
in our assistance commitments, it is bound to appear as mere rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
It is not practical for Congress to make the precise linkage between Middle 
East assistance commitments and the peace process, so a grant of greater 
discretion to the President would be wise. Such authority might usefully permit 
variations in assistance levels in a range of cases -- for example, hostile 
intelligence operations in the United States, support for organizations or 
individuals engaged in terrorism or drug traffic, violations of human rights. 
Without ending its earmarking of all aid funds, Congress would do well to 
encourage the President to reduce assistance flows where the recipient thwarts 
essential American purposes. 
</P>
<P>
In both Israel and the United States, the politics of such linkage will be 
arduous. But we cannot disentangle our own policy knots by constant homage to 
the contortions of others. Immanuel Kant wrote that the task of morality is not 
to make ourselves happy, but to make ourselves worthy of happiness. We do not 
make ourselves worthy of peace by encouraging friends to weaken its 
foundations.

FISHING CRAFT'S SINKING WAS 'SCARE OF MY LIFE'; 
</P>
<P>
SHIPWRECK: FISHERMEN SAY THE ACCIDENT OFF CATALINA WAS THE FIRST TOTAL LOSS 
WITHIN MEMORY AMONG CHARTER VESSELS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
One minute, Don Bowen was cruising along in the 65-foot Queen of the Sea, 
heading for a cove where sea bass had been biting the week before. 
</P>
<P>
The next minute, the boat had collided with a submerged rock. With its rudder 
snapped off and propellers broken, waves were taking it toward the rocky 
western side of Santa Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty minutes later, pounding surf was reducing the boat to a mass of 
splinters, forcing Bowen, 37, of Bellflower, and his crewman, Don Gish, 40, of 
Torrance to abandon ship. They were rescued half an hour later by a Catalina 
harbor rescue boat that came from Avalon; Gish suffered minor abrasions. 
</P>
<P>
Fishermen at the 22nd Street landing in San Pedro described the Feb. 26 
accident as the first total loss within memory among the charter sportfishing 
vessels that harbor there. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't recall one ever happening," said Roger Hess, owner of the Encore and 
Charisma sportfishing and dive boats. 
</P>
<P>
The accident was a shock to the Queen's owner, John Dipley of Carson, who was 
not aboard the boat the day it sank. 
</P>
<P>
"I have an invalid mother who needs 24-hour nursing care and now my entire 
income is gone," lamented Dipley, 43, in a brief dockside interview. 
</P>
<P>
The distraught Dipley displayed a single spoke from the wheel of the Queen, 
which he was saving as a memento, nervously pounding it against the palm of one 
enormous hand. 
</P>
<P>
Dipley, whose wide knowledge of local waters matches his Falstaffian girth, 
said that a $250,000 insurance policy will not cover the $600,000 needed in 
replacement costs. 
</P>
<P>
But he added gamely that he will try to start again. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I've ever done in my life is fishing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As word of the Queen's demise got around the dockside, the tightknit 
professional fishing fraternity -- a group of men with weathered faces and 
perpetual squints not given to expressing emotions lightly -- sympathized with 
Dipley. 
</P>
<P>
"We do feel badly for John," said Hess, as he sipped a beer in the cabin of the 
Charisma. "We'll do what we can to get him going again." 
</P>
<P>
Bert Mikkelsen, owner of the Alter Ego and the Reel Hooker charter boats, said: 
"I hate to see John lose his boat. He is one of the better skippers here. He 
has quite a following." 
</P>
<P>
With Dipley attending to his ailing mother and unable to captain his charter 
boat, Bowen and Gish had set out that Sunday night to fish for squid to sell as 
bait, and to try their luck at sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
The collision occurred about 6:30 a.m. as Bowen was rounding the southern tip 
of Catalina to the cove where sea bass had been plentiful, Bowen said at the 
dock. 
</P>
<P>
Submerged rocks that are visible at low tide as "boiling rocks" were hidden by 
high tide, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I came in a little close," Bowen acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
After the collision, the Coast Guard received a Mayday call from the Queen at 
6:42 a.m. that the boat had gone aground at Mills Landing, which is about 3 1/2 
miles south of Catalina Harbor, according to Chief Petty Officer Reid Crispino. 
</P>
<P>
Bowen said the deck of the Queen was tilted at a 45-degree angle when he called 
for help. 
</P>
<P>
Crispino said that the crew of Catalina Harbor Rescue No. 6, which arrived 
alongside the Queen at 7:05, maneuvered to within 30 feet of the disintegrating 
vessel and that Bowen and Gish jumped in the water and swam to safety. 
</P>
<P>
At 9:35, a Coast Guard helicopter flew over; only wreckage was visible. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the scare of my life," a shaken Bowen said hours after the mishap. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never been through that before and I never want to be through that 
again."

BOARD KEEPS GUARDS, REJECTS PROPOSAL TO PUT POLICE OFFICERS IN SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROXANA KOPETMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Long Beach Board of Education has rejected a plan to put uniformed police 
officers in the public schools, saying that they would give teachers and 
students a false sense of security and might even be viewed as racist. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the school board voted 4 to 1 late last month to keep its force of 
security guards. 
</P>
<P>
The board unanimously agreed to give the guards more training but did not 
specify what type. Unlike police officers, security guards are not required to 
update their training. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Jerry Shultz last year cited lack of training as one of the major 
reasons he raised the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The board also voted to provide teachers and staff members with more training 
in the areas of drug intervention, gangs, graffiti and weapons control. In 
addition, the board agreed to add one more staff assistant at each high school 
to help monitor hallways and supervise for safety. 
</P>
<P>
While overall campus crime has not sharply increased since last year, according 
to district statistics, there were several gun-related incidents near schools 
last fall that scared many students and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, vandalism costs increased by 107% from the previous school year, 
costing the district $1.4 million. That figure is expected to double in 1989-90 
if the trend continues. 
</P>
<P>
For months, the board had heard from parents and teachers concerned about crime 
in the schools. Led by Shultz, some parents had urged the board to upgrade the 
status of its security guards to police officers to ensure better protection. 
</P>
<P>
Security guards, who wear uniforms and carry guns, act as observers and report 
disturbances to the Long Beach police. While they can question trespassers on 
campus, they do not have the authority to stop them from walking away or to 
take them to jail. "They basically have no more rights than any other citizen," 
Shultz said after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The guards said that street-savvy kids know the difference between them and 
police officers. "They just say 'Hey, buzz o" guard Ed West told the board. 
</P>
<P>
Their problem, Shultz said, is compounded by the staffing shortages at the Long 
Beach Police Department, where officer response time has slowed in the last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
But opponents argued that changing the guards' status would only serve to raise 
unrealistic expectations that campus police would eliminate crime. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the proposal divided community leaders, and the task force 
appointed to study the issue split 11 to 8 in recommending against the campus 
police plan. 
</P>
<P>
Minority leaders added another twist to the issue when they labeled the plan 
racist and urged the board to defeat it. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, 
the League of United Latin American Citizens and the district's Hispanic 
Advisory Committee said the plan represented Anglos' fears of the changing 
ethnic makeup of the school district. 
</P>
<P>
"Who is asking for this and why are they asking for this?" Jerome Torres, 
chairman of the district's Hispanic Advisory Committee, asked the school board. 
An overwhelming majority of the parents who had requested campus police are 
white, Torres said. It was "a vocal minority afraid of an unknown entity," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you want to project a racist, intolerant image?" asked Tonia Reyes Uranga, 
a league representative. 
</P>
<P>
Minority leaders said that having police on campuses could lead to an 
accidental shooting, and they said the victim would likely be a black or a 
Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Bobbie Smith, the only black member of the board, told the audience: "My ethnic 
group has for years and years been the victim of police violence, and on that 
basis alone I would be opposed." 
</P>
<P>
Board member Shultz, the only one to vote for the campus police plan, said he 
was "shocked and disgusted with the suggestion this is a racist issue." 
</P>
<P>
"Crime is not determined by race," Shultz said, adding that this latest 
argument is "skirting the issue." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the concerns expressed, the board agreed unanimously to 
encourage programs promoting multiracial, multicultural understanding, similar 
to those established at Polytechnic High School. 
</P>
<P>
Board members and top district administrators have expressed opposition to a 
campus police plan for months. They said it was unlikely to lower campus crime, 
but it would cost the district more money and alter the image of schools as a 
safe haven.

RIGHTS: BRIAN URA IS USING A CALIFORNIA LAW THAT ALLOWS A VISUAL ARTIST TO 
COLLECT DAMAGES AND ATTORNEYS' FEES FROM SOMEONE WHO ALTERS, MUTILATES OR 
DESTROYS ONE OF HIS ARTWORKS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Artist Brian Ura often worked late into the night trying to get the colors just 
right on the seven still lifes of fruits and vegetables he was painting for a 
posh new San Diego-area hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The $12,300 commission was the biggest ever for Ura, a struggling artist. 
Eagerly, he traveled to Coronado for Le Meridien Hotel's grand opening in June, 
1988. He was shocked to find his paintings covered with a dark, blotchy coating 
of stain or varnish that Ura said was applied so crudely that "it looked like 
shoe polish." 
</P>
<P>
"It was like someone had slapped me across the face. I was numb," said Ura, 42. 
"The subtle color nuances were totally destroyed. I feel the paintings are not 
mine anymore. I'm embarrassed to have people see my name on them." 
</P>
<P>
Until 10 years ago, Ura would have had no legal recourse unless he had 
expressly reserved his rights in advance by contract. Even today, he would have 
few options in most parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
But Ura took advantage of a pioneering California law that allows a visual 
artist to collect damages and attorneys' fees from someone who alters, 
mutilates or destroys one of his original artworks -- even if the artist no 
longer owns it. 
</P>
<P>
Ura filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court last July seeking $1 million 
in actual and punitive damages from Neal Menzies, the art consultant who hired 
him to do the paintings; the hotel's art designer, Cynthia Forchielli and her 
company, Intra Designs and the framer, Jerry Solomon, all of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Forchielli and Solomon did not return several phone calls from The Times. 
Menzies' attorney, Jonathan Chodos, said his client had nothing to do with the 
alterations and called Ura's lawsuit "totally without legal and moral 
justification." 
</P>
<P>
The hotel was dropped from the lawsuit after Ura's attorney, Jeffrey Karpel, 
concluded that hotel officials did not authorize or know about the changes to 
the paintings, which still hang in the hotel restaurant. The paintings 
apparently had been considered too bright for the restaurant's subdued 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-year-old California law on which Ura based his lawsuit, the California 
Art Preservation Act, is the first of its kind in the nation. Authored by 
former State Sen. Alan Sieroty (D-Los Angeles), it prohibits unauthorized 
changes to works of "fine art," which the law defines as "original paintings, 
sculptures, drawings or artworks in glass." The law does not protect artwork 
created for commercial uses in "advertising, magazines, newspapers or other 
print and electronic media." 
</P>
<P>
The law is based on the doctrine of droit moral, or moral right, which holds 
that a work of art is an expression of the artist's creative personality, 
giving the artist an interest in his art even after its sale. 
</P>
<P>
"If you were an artist who had invested five years of your life in creating 
something that you thought was extraordinarily wonderful but because the only 
way artists can live is to sell their work, you had to part with it, how would 
you feel about someone destroying it?," asked Stephen E. Weil, deputy director 
of the Hirshhorn Museum, the modern art branch of the Smithsonian Institution 
in Washington and co-author of two books on art law. 
</P>
<P>
An artist's reputation depends on his artwork; if it is destroyed, he can't use 
it to attract potential clients, mount it in a retrospective show of his works, 
or reproduce it in exercise of his copyrights, said La Jolla arts lawyer Peter 
Karlen, who perhaps has handled more artists rights cases than any other lawyer 
in the state. 
</P>
<P>
The doctrine also holds that changing or destroying original works of art 
deprives the public of a part of its culture, said Greg Victoroff, co-chairman 
of the Beverly Hills Bar Assn.'s Committee for the Arts. The doctrine says that 
original artworks need special protection because they are unique and 
irreplaceable. 
</P>
<P>
"Records and books are virtually indestructible because they exist in 
multiples," Weil said. "You could not destroy Beethoven's Fifth Symphony no 
matter how hard you tried. But destroy a work of art and it's gone forever." 
</P>
<P>
The doctrine originated around the turn of the century in France. The concept 
is alien to American precepts of property rights, which generally permit people 
to do whatever they want with what they own, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
There was no legal recourse, therefore, for artist Alfred D. Crimi, who devoted 
years of painstaking work to a large fresco commissioned for a wall of Rutgers 
Presbyterian Church in New York City. In 1946, eight years after he finished 
it, the congregation's leaders decided that Christ's bare chest looked too 
worldly and, without consulting Crimi, painted over the fresco. 
</P>
<P>
Devastated, the artist unsuccessfully sued seeking to have the paint removed or 
the fresco detached and given to him. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander Calder also was frustrated by the lack of moral rights protections 
after a private collector donated his mobile "Pittsburgh," to that city's 
municipal airport in 1958. Without Calder's permission, the city repainted the 
black and white mobile in the county colors, green and gold, and motorized it 
to turn steadily. 
</P>
<P>
Calder spent the last 18 years of his life trying to get the mobile restored to 
its original state. It was finally done after his death. 
</P>
<P>
The late artist Isamu Noguchi realized he might as well not even bother to sue 
when a New York branch of the Bank of Tokyo decided to remove his sculpture 
"Shinto" from its lobby in 1980. Customers had complained that the 1,600-pound 
sculpture of a 17-foot-long rhomboid hanging point-downward, suspended by steel 
cables, was like a big guillotine poised overhead. 
</P>
<P>
Because it wouldn't fit through the doors or windows, the sculpture was cut 
into pieces and stuck in a warehouse. The artist called it vandalism but had no 
legal recourse. 
</P>
<P>
Today, artists' moral rights are recognized in more than 70 countries, 
including almost all of Western Europe except the Communist bloc, and parts of 
Latin America and Africa. Great Britain last year enacted moral rights 
legislation for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Moral rights still are not recognized in the United States, with the exception 
of California and nine other states -- Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maine, New 
York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, New Mexico and Connecticut -- 
that followed California's lead by passing various forms of moral rights 
legislation. Artists occasionally have used legal arguments rooted in libel, 
defamation and unfair trade practice law to protect their artistic rights. 
</P>
<P>
Although the United States last year became one of 89 nations to sign the Berne 
Convention on international copyright law, which contains artists' moral rights 
protections, those protections are largely symbolic, Weil said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sen. Edward Kennedy, (D-Mass.) has introduced national moral rights 
legislation and a similar bill has been introduced in the House. Hearings have 
been held and the bills are in committee. 
</P>
<P>
The California law, like most in this country, protects only works of 
"recognized quality," a proviso designed in part to make sure a doting mother 
doesn't sue her child's kindergarten teacher for throwing out her child's 
finger-painting, Weil said. 
</P>
<P>
The subjective decision of what constitutes quality is to be determined by the 
trial court after testimony from dealers, gallery owners, art historians, 
museum curators and other art experts. Under the law, an artist can insist that 
his name be put on or taken off his artwork, said Edward J. Damich, associate 
professor at George Mason University School of Law in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
The California law also allows the awarding of punitive damages, not to the 
artist, but to a nonprofit arts organization selected by the court. The law 
also permits an artist or nonprofit arts organization acting on the public's 
behalf to seek an injunction to prevent damage to an artwork. 
</P>
<P>
The law extends rights to artists and their heirs only for 50 years beyond the 
life of the artist, meaning privately owned paintings by the Old Masters can be 
altered with impunity. In addition, you can buy a work of fine art in 
California, move to one of the 40 states without moral rights laws, and do 
whatever you want with it. 
</P>
<P>
"You can still play darts with your Rembrandt," Weil said. "You can take your 
painting to Wyoming and destroy the hell out of it to your heart's content." 
</P>
<P>
Even in those 10 states with laws, permissible conduct varies widely. New York, 
for instance, allows a work to be altered if it isn't publicly displayed, said 
Damich. Thus, you can mutilate a painting in New York and show it in California 
without violating either state's moral rights laws. 
</P>
<P>
Theoretically the laws of some states could even affect the average citizen who 
tires of a painting and throws it out. But experts say even in the unlikely 
event the artist sued, the work would have to be "of recognized quality" for 
the artist to recover damages. 
</P>
<P>
It is impossible to say how many lawsuits have been brought under the 
California act. Most cases are settled out of court, in part because it is 
usually easy to prove an artwork was destroyed intentionally and it is not 
worth the expense of a protracted legal battle, Karlen said. Settlements 
generally run between seven and 10 times the artwork's original purchase price, 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
The only California case that has been reviewed at the appellate court level 
was an unsuccessful attempt by an architect to seek the act's protections, 
experts said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the California cases support a stereotypical notion of California as 
the home of the bizarre and eccentric. For instance, in the early 1980s, a Los 
Angeles art dealer got it into his head that some bronze sculptures of nudes in 
strange contorted postures in his gallery were evil. The dealer staged an 
artistic exorcism of sorts in which he and his friends danced around the 
sculptures, etching crosses into them. The artist contemplated suing but didn't 
have to; the gallery owner voluntarily paid for the damage, Karlen said. 
</P>
<P>
Another San Diego artist sued under the moral rights law after his 
ex-girlfriend took a painting he had given her before their relationship 
soured, ripped it up, scribbled profanities on the pieces and mailed it to him. 
He received a small judgment, Karlen said. 
</P>
<P>
In another case in the 1980s, an artist sued and received an out of court 
settlement from a collector who removed 50 dollar bills from the artist's 
avant-garde conceptual painting and, apparently, spent them, said Karlen. 
</P>
<P>
Although artists have also used the law to recover damages for mutilated 
murals, it's still a gray area that experts say will undoubtedly be decided 
upon by the appellate courts. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Harvey A. Schneider ruled last month that the 
state law does not protect murals because the law does not specify murals as 
works of fine art. But Schneider urged the muralists to appeal the ruling, 
which came in a case involving a mural commissioned by Shell Oil Co. for a wall 
adjoining a Boyle Heights gas station that later was remodeled by new owners. 
</P>
<P>
French moral rights go much farther than those in the United States, giving an 
artist the right to decide whether a work of art shall be made public, the 
right to remain anonymous or use a pseudonym and the right to receive royalties 
when the work is resold. (California is the only state in this country to allow 
royalties. The controversial Resale Royalties Act, also authored by Sieroty and 
passed in 1977, requires payment of a 5% royalty fee to an artist whose work is 
resold for more than $1,000 profit.) 
</P>
<P>
Whereas moral rights exist only in the visual arts in this country, the French 
recognize it in all artistic forms -- including architecture. For instance, 
poet Paul Claudell was able to prevent his play from being performed with one 
act omitted in France, whereas playwright Samuel Beckett had no legal recourse 
to stop a production in Boston four years ago that he said misrepresented one 
of his works, Weil said. 
</P>
<P>
France gives moral rights protections to a film's screenwriters, directors and 
composers after the final print is released, which has been used in France to 
prevent the showing of colorized films. Currently, the issue of colorizing 
films is on appeal with the French Supreme Court. When "The Asphalt Jungle" was 
broadcast on TV in a test case, it was shown in color and in black and white. 
Legal attempts to prevent the showing of colorized films in this country have 
failed, Damich said. 
</P>
<P>
The moral rights laws of Massachusetts and New Mexico extend to motion pictures 
in limited cases. 
</P>
<P>
The French even allow an artist the right to buy back a work if the artist 
decides it no longer represents him, Weil said. For instance, Anatole France in 
1882 sold a historical book to a publisher who waited 25 years -- until France 
was famous -- to publish it. France sued and was able to prevent publication by 
reimbursing the publisher for the cost of his contract, Karlen said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, back in Studio City, Ura said the lawsuit has taken time and energy 
from his artwork and may also have hurt him professionally. It's something the 
artist, who rolls up the living room carpet of his tiny rented home for studio 
space, can ill afford. 
</P>
<P>
He thinks at least one gallery has dropped his work because of the suit. His 
earnings have dropped and his girlfriend is supporting him, he said. But he 
said he felt he had an obligation to sue. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that what they did was illegal but above that, it was immoral," said 
Ura, a 1971 honors graduate of the San Francisco Art Institute who prides 
himself on his skill with color. Not to do anything "would have been 
contributing to the wrongness of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Chodos said his client and the others had the right to change Ura's work 
because "he was simply doing a painting to their specifications. It was not a 
creative work on his part. It's as if they told him, 'Could you come in and 
paint my car?' "

5TH-GRADERS MAY GET TO CHOOSE SCHOOL TRANSFERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Palos Verdes school board members tentatively approved a plan Monday to allow 
current fifth-graders at Mira Catalina and Rancho Vista elementary schools to 
transfer to the school of their choice next fall. 
</P>
<P>
The plan would save the financially strapped district the cost of buying 
portable classrooms and would give the students a wider range of programs to 
choose from, according to district officials. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Catalina and Rancho Vista are the only schools within the district where 
sixth-graders attend an elementary school. All other sixth-graders are enrolled 
in intermediate schools. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the 137 fifth-graders would be allowed to attend either 
Ridgecrest or Malaga Cove intermediate schools or Miraleste High School, where 
a sixth grade would be created. 
</P>
<P>
Miraleste, which the school board has sought to close because of declining 
enrollment, presently serves grades seven through 12. However, district policy 
now allows any seventh- or eighth-grader to attend an intermediate school 
regardless of where they live. 
</P>
<P>
The district's other two high schools serve grades nine through 12. 
</P>
<P>
Acting school Supt. Wayne Butterbaugh said the district plan can not be carried 
out until Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Miram Vogel reviews it and 
determines whether it violates her earlier court decision. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Vogel prohibited the district from closing Miraleste or transferring 
any east-side students to west-side schools until it completes an environmental 
impact report on school closures districtwide. The district is preparing the 
report and expects it to be complete by May. 
</P>
<P>
If the judge agrees that the plan does not violate the court order, the board 
is expected to cast a final vote on the matter on March 19, district officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Butterbaugh said that the district, which faces a $2.9-million deficit this 
fiscal year, would save $195,000 if the fifth-graders are allowed to attend 
other schools because it would not have to buy three new portable classrooms. 
The classrooms are needed to replace existing ones that do not meet state 
construction codes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Catalina Principal Karen Jaconi said she favors allowing the fifth-graders 
to transfer to the other campuses because they would then have a counselor and 
a vice principal at their disposal. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the school would regain part of its playground where the sixth-graders' 
portable classrooms now sit, she said. Sixth-graders began attending the school 
three years ago when the district closed an intermediate school because of 
declining enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Hildebrand, vice president of the east-side parents' group that has waged 
a lengthy battle to keep Miraleste open, asserted that board members should not 
have vote on the plan until Vogel had a chance to review it. 
</P>
<P>
Hildebrand, who unsuccessfully ran for a school board seat last fall, also said 
he feared that some fifth-grade students who elect to go to one of the 
district's intermediate schools instead of Miraleste High School might not be 
required to transfer back to Miraleste once they reach the ninth grade.

</P>
<P>
WAC TOURNAMENT: INABILITY TO EAT UP CLOCK AND PROTECT LEAD LATE IN SECOND HALF 
RESULTS IN 70-64 OVERTIME LOSS TO AIR FORCE AND AN EARLY END TO THE BASKETBALL 
SEASON.

Five minutes passed. Then 10. Finally, after about 15 minutes, the door to the 
San Diego State locker room swung open. 
</P>
<P>
Time was moving about as slowly as the game clock had after SDSU blew a 
10-point lead in the last 7:01 of regulation Wednesday night and lost to Air 
Force, 70-64, in overtime in the eighth-place game of the Western Athletic 
Conference basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Strewn among the empty soda cups, a WAC tournament program and a rolled up pair 
of socks in the locker room at the Texas El Paso Special Events Center were the 
remains of the 1989-90 San Diego State basketball season. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Arthur Massey sat slumped in a chair, wearing his warmup jacket. Swingman 
Michael Hudson left without a uniform top, dressed only in game shorts, shoes 
and socks. 
</P>
<P>
Who needed a jersey? The season was finished. 
</P>
<P>
It ended as so many of SDSU's recent games have, in a flurry of frustration and 
missed free throws, surprises and turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs had overcome an 11-point deficit and built a 10-point lead of their 
own, 55-45, with 7:01 left. The next thing they knew, Air Force had a 58-55 
lead with 26 seconds left in regulation after scoring 13 consecutive points. 
</P>
<P>
But the Aztecs had the ball. Michael Best inbounded to Massey near the 
half-court line, and Massey found Hudson open at the top of the three-point arc 
to the left of the basket. Hudson dribbled and stepped in, then stepped back 
and let it fly. 
</P>
<P>
Swish. 58-58. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force inbounded to Jeff Bowling, a 5-11 point guard who had driven SDSU 
crazy all evening. Bowling fired up a running 20-footer that didn't have a 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
Overtime. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU guard Rodney Jones had fouled out with 44 seconds left in regulation. Best 
did midway through the overtime period. Hudson fouled out with 21 seconds to 
play when he grabbed Bowling hard enough to clear the benches. Technicals were 
assessed to Hudson and Air Force's Dale French, who went after Hudson. 
</P>
<P>
The resultant free throws made -- four for Air Force, one for the Aztecs -- 
made it 70-63. Bowling had a big part in ultimately deciding this battle of the 
have-nots, scoring 10 of Air Force's 12 points in overtime including eight for 
eight from the line. 
</P>
<P>
Shawn Jamison of SDSU made just eight of 21 free throw attempts. He had two air 
balls -- his fifth and sixth of the season -- including one on the front end of 
a one-and-one with 1:07 left in regulation and SDSU trailing, 56-55. In 
overtime, he was one for five. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes he shoots them well, and sometimes he shoots them poorly," SDSU 
Coach Jim Brandenburg said. "It's a real problem. We're just going to have to 
work it out." 
</P>
<P>
For the game, SDSU was 43% from the field (21 of 49) and 50% from the line (19 
of 38). 
</P>
<P>
That was part of the reason why SDSU (13-18, 4-12) lost its seventh game in a 
row, seventh of eight since center Marty Dow left for the season with a foot 
injury and 13th in the past 17. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason was Bowling. He's supposed to pass the ball, leading the WAC in 
assists with seven per game. He also averaged seven points a game entering the 
tournament. He scorched SDSU for a game-high 26. 
</P>
<P>
Since Raymond Dudley, the WAC's leading scorer (21 points a game), scored 20 
points but made just seven of 21 field goal attempts, Bowling's input helped 
quite a bit. Jamison led SDSU with 20, and Hudson had 15. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU led just once in the first half, by a point. Air Force (11-19, 3-13) took 
an 11-point lead -- the Falcons' largest of the game -- just before halftime. 
They led, 37-27, with 17:51 to play in regulation, and then SDSU made its move. 
</P>
<P>
Jamison hit a jump-hook. Massey made two free throws, and Jamison dunked. 
Hudson and Eeric White made layups. Suddenly, it was 37-37. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't stop there. The Aztecs eventually went ahead, 55-45, with 7:01 to 
play, and Brandenburg ordered them to slow down the pace. 
</P>
<P>
That was the first sign of trouble. At times this season, the Aztecs attempting 
to hold the ball and eat up some of the 45-second clock has been akin to waving 
a lamb chop in front of a wolf. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force bit. 
</P>
<P>
Jones turned the ball over, then missed a three-pointer on SDSU's next 
possession. Jamison was called for traveling. SDSU tried to pick the pace back 
up, but the lead had shrunk to one, 55-54. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to spread the court a little," Jones said. "Slow the tempo. Milk the 
clock. But we didn't attack the basket as we had at the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"We slowed it down with one thing in mind. Milk the clock." 
</P>
<P>
Brandenburg at first said he didn't regret momentarily slowing it down. 
</P>
<P>
"Hell, no," he said. "The thing is, we turned it over and took a bad shot 
because we didn't get into the offense. It was not a long period of time." 
</P>
<P>
But he then seemed to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we didn't win the game, so I would like to have done something 
different," he said softly. "I'm not sure what, but something different." 
</P>
<P>
Air Force will play top-seeded Colorado State (21-7, 11-5) at 8:35 tonight.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL: CAL STATE FULLERTON'S 82-63 VICTORY IN THE BIG WEST 
TOURNAMENT BRINGS AN END TO UC IRVINE'S LONGEST SEASON.

<P>
Bill Mulligan could pick up a calendar and pinpoint it weeks in advance. The 
happiest day of his life, waiting for his arrival. 
</P>
<P>
As of March 7, Mulligan and his UC Irvine basketball team would be rid of the 
worst season in the school's 25-year history, and through with that losing 
streak, no matter how long it had stretched. 
</P>
<P>
The day came Wednesday, and as expected, the season ended before the day did. 
Irvine's last loss in a 5-23 season came against Cal State Fullerton, 82-63, in 
the first round of the Big West Conference tournament at Long Beach Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton, which stopped a seven-game losing streak, advances to a quarterfinal 
game against third-ranked Nevada Las Vegas at 9 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Some reward: UNLV has eliminated Fullerton each of the past five tournaments 
and beat the Titans by 28 and 18 points this season. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine arrived at the final day of its season as scheduled, but a funny thing 
happened on the way to the celebration. Irvine actually had cause for 
disappointment. After breaking their school-record losing streak at 15 games 
against UC Santa Barbara, the Anteaters won three of their final six games -- 
.500 ball -- including an 18-point victory over Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we were really good," Mulligan said, and waited a beat. "We 
weren't." 
</P>
<P>
No, they weren't. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton put the final stamp on a strange season's series between the teams. 
The Titans won by 27 points, and lost the second by 18. This time they jumped 
to a 36-16 lead in the first half, and that was about it. 
</P>
<P>
Against Fullerton late last month, Irvine shot 51% from the field, 80% from the 
line, and 64% from three-point range -- 14 of 22. 
</P>
<P>
Dylan Rigdon, a freshman, made seven of seven three-pointers in that game and 
nine of nine shots. 
</P>
<P>
Against Fullerton Wednesday night? No resemblance. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, Irvine went 0 for 9 from three-point range. And Fullerton 
made seven of 11, including all three attempts by Van Anderson, a reserve 
forward who averages three points a game. 
</P>
<P>
By the game's end, Irvine had made only 41% of its shots. Excepting the work of 
center Ricky Butler, who made 10 of 14 shots and scored 22 points, the 
Anteaters made only 16 of 50 shots -- 32%. 
</P>
<P>
From the free-throw line, they made only six of 13 -- 46%. 
</P>
<P>
And Rigdon, unflappable and unstoppable in the previous game, made only one 
shot, a layup, and went 0 for 5 from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
It was a big difference from the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, he missed shots tonight," Fullerton Coach John Sneed said of Rigdon. 
"Last time, from 19, 25 feet, everything he threw up went in. We had a little 
more awareness of where he was this time." 
</P>
<P>
Rod Palmer, the only senior starter on the Irvine team, added 20 points, 
including five three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton shot 51%, and made eight of 17 three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
"On a given night, there's no substitute for shooting the basketball," Sneed 
said. "I think Mulligan will agree with that." 
</P>
<P>
For the only time this season, Fullerton started a game without Cedric Ceballos 
on the court. Sneed benched him for the first four minutes for being late to 
Tuesday's practice. 
</P>
<P>
Ceballos, who wore a black armband with the name "Hank" on it, said he was late 
after attending the memorial service for Hank Gathers, who was his teammate on 
a summer league team at Cal State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Ceballos finished with 19 points and 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Hill led Fullerton with 22 points, making nine of 15 shots, including two 
three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to go out tonight and lose the game," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
As Ceballos saw it, Fullerton owed Irvine something. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a hard loss," he said of the teams' previous meeting. "We expected to 
get that one. It put us in the position of having to play Irvine (in the 
tournament's first round). If we had won, they probably would have played 
someone else." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (13-15), which has struggled lately, played much better. 
</P>
<P>
"Unbelieveable," Sneed said. "It couldn't have come at a better time." 
</P>
<P>
Just in time for a game against UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan, pressed for a prediction, tried to be diplomatic, with little 
success. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to get into that," he said. "I don't know, you know, maybe they 
can hang in there and do a good job . . . I think Vegas is a Final Four team. 
I've said that all along." 
</P>
<P>
Ceballos, who have averaged 28 points and 15 rebounds in the five games he has 
played against UNLV in his career, has a theory himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's time for an upset," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tournament Notes 
</P>
<P>
As expected, Larry Johnson of Nevada Las Vegas was chosen the Big West 
Conference player of the year in a polling of the coaches. UNLV's Stacey 
Augmon, last year's player of the year, didn't make the first or second team, 
earning only honorable mention. . . . Cedric Ceballos, runner-up to Augmon last 
year, repeated as a first-team selection. . . . There is hope for the future 
for Irvine, which placed two players on the all-freshman team: Dylan Rigdon and 
Jeff Von Lutzow. Other members were Lucious Harris of Cal State Long Beach, 
Idris Jones of UC Santa Barbara and Kevin Logan of San Jose State.

MORNING BRIEFING: VERSACE HAS TROUBLE BREAKING OWN TEAM'S FULL-COURT PRESS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Coach Dick Versace of the Indiana Pacers has been feuding with Indianapolis 
reporters David Brenner and Steve Brunner, and according to the San Francisco 
Examiner, he called a team meeting, in which he told the players how to handle 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"Dave and Steve are nice guys, but they're from the country. They don't know 
any better. So watch what you say to them," was the gist of Versace's message. 
</P>
<P>
Says Benner: "Within 30 minutes after the meeting, two of the players told me 
everything that went on. Within four days after the meeting, eight players came 
up and told me what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Hair-raising: Heavyweight champion Buster Douglas, on Don King: "I'm not sure 
where he stands. He's been working on me. I see him in my dreams saying, 
'Buster, Buster, come to me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Now-it-can-be-told Dept.: Marvin Godwin, a two-way back from Camden, N.J., 
forsook Ohio State at the last minute and signed with UCLA because his mother 
liked Bruin recruiter Jacob Burney. 
</P>
<P>
Godwin told the Philadelphia Inquirer that his mother had known Burney when he 
was an assistant at Wisconsin, where another of her sons is playing. 
</P>
<P>
Said Godwin: "She liked him a lot. She really didn't like the recruiter from 
Ohio State." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What do Reggie Williams of the San Antonio Spurs, Muggsy Bogues of 
the Charlotte Hornets and Reggie Lewis of the Boston Celtics have in common? 
(Answer below.) 
</P>
<P>
Add Williams: He flopped with the Clippers after they had made him the No. 4 
pick in the first round of the draft, and he quickly wore out his welcome in 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Said Peter May of the Hartford Courant: "He didn't endear himself with anyone 
with his pathetic work habits (last to arrive, first to leave). He ranks as one 
of the biggest draft boondoggles since Bill Garnett, who also was taken No. 4, 
by the Dallas Mavericks." 
</P>
<P>
Grrrr: From Philadelphia forward Charles Barkley: "I can't stand Bill Laimbeer. 
I'd just love to bait him into a fight one time, but he won't fight. He plays 
dirty but he doesn't want to fight." 
</P>
<P>
Add Barkley: Laughing at attempts by the Detroit Pistons to intimidate former 
teammate Rick Mahorn when they played the 76ers, Barkley said, "God gave Mahorn 
the sense of a billy-goat. You can't intimidate him." 
</P>
<P>
More Barkley: Says CBS analyst Hubie Brown: "He rebounds like Wes Unseld and 
jumps like Julius Erving. How can you beat that?" 
</P>
<P>
Woof, woof: Said Arkansas basketball Coach Nolan Richardson when asked why he 
stomps up and down, screaming at his players in practice: "I always believe we 
will take our practices to games with us. I make practices 40 minutes of hell. 
I've always said I want my players to be savage dogs with rabies when they 
play." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: They were teammates at Baltimore Dunbar High School.

WEBSTER MAKES NO DIFFERENCE; 
</P>
<P>
KINGS: HEAD COACH RETURNS, BUT TEAM CONTINUES POOR PLAY IN 5-2 LOSS TO 
CANADIENS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Kings' management has said all along that coaching wasn't the team's problem. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings showed that Wednesday night, proving they can look just as bad with 
Tom Webster behind the bench as they did without him. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings welcomed Webster back after a month-long absence because of an ear 
injury with a 5-2 loss to the Montreal Canadiens at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
After suffering through his team's slide toward the bottom of the Smythe 
Division in the comfort of his den via television, Webster found watching his 
club up close and personal a discomforting experience. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny," he said, "From afar, you think you have all of the answers. But 
it's different when you're down there behind the bench, sharing all the highs 
and lows." 
</P>
<P>
There were mostly lows Wednesday as the Kings lost their fourth game in a row. 
Montreal (36-26-7) broke a three-game losing streak of its own with the 
victory, dropping the Kings to 28-34-6. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings weren't in this game for long. 
</P>
<P>
Stephane Richer's first goal of the evening, at 3:02 of the opening period, 
gave the Canadiens a 1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Shayne Corson, falling to the ice at the red line, shoved the puck to Richer, 
who skated free on the breakaway and jammed the puck through a helpless Ron 
Scott's pads from just a few feet away. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings got even on Petr Prajsler's third goal, a shot from the right circle 
that sailed over Patrick Roy's right shoulder at 18:58. 
</P>
<P>
That put the Kings back in the game. For 15 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Before the cheers of the sellout crowd of 16,005 had even faded, Montreal was 
back out in front, thanks to Richer. 
</P>
<P>
After Brian Skrudland got a loose puck away from Luc Robitaille on the right 
boards, he centered it for Richer, who made the best of another short shot to 
score his team-leading 43rd goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadiens extended their lead 2:11 into the second period on a power play. 
Mike Keane scored off a rebound, flipping the puck over Scott for his ninth 
goal, but first on a power play. 
</P>
<P>
At 11:01, the Canadiens added to their lead with Courtnall putting the puck 
into the net over Scott's glove from the right side. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky added to his league-leading point total with his 37th goal to 
bring the Kings closer at 4-2 at 17:14 of the second period. Steve Kasper's 
pass from the right side sailed across the middle to Gretzky, who was charging 
in from the left. The league's all-time scorer squeezed the puck through on the 
short side. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
King defenseman Brian Benning, who underwent an emergency appendectomy Tuesday 
night, will be out at least the rest of the month, which means the remainder of 
the regular season. . . . The Kings hope to have defensemen Tom Laidlaw (knee 
sprain) and Larry Robinson (stomach disorder) back by Saturday's game against 
the Pittsburgh Penguins. Right wing Tomas Sandstrom also hopes to be playing by 
then. Sandstrom has recovered quickly from the facial fracture and scratched 
cornea he suffered in last Wednesday's brawl with the Edmonton Oilers.

THE DEATH OF HANK GATHERS; 
</P>
<P>
GATHERS TOUCHED THOSE WHO KNEW HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I did not look at the picture of Hank Gathers that appeared on the front page 
of Monday's Times. I prefer to remember him as I knew him -- a shy, smiling 
college freshman, a little less sure of himself in the classroom than on the 
basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
Thrust onto the center stage that is USC athletics, I remember him, and others, 
coming to class that first day late and hesitant. Being an athlete was not an 
excuse for not being a student, I told them. He listened. 
</P>
<P>
That was the last time Hank was ever late or hesitant. If he did not have the 
highest SAT scores or the surest reading and writing skills, he had something 
better: a willingness and desire to learn all that he could. After that first 
day, he'd bound into class, sit up straight, stare at me, and say, "OK, Teach, 
teach me something new today." 
</P>
<P>
For all of us in English 101 and 102 -- particularly Bo, Rich, Tom and myself 
-- the loss of Hank Gathers has nothing to do with the number of points scored 
or projections of bright NBA futures. His loss is more immediate and personal, 
immeasurable because it is of one of our own.

BIG WEST CONFERENCE MEN'S TOURNAMENT; 
</P>
<P>
FULLERTON FINISHES OFF IRVINE, WILL FACE LAS VEGAS ON FRIDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
UC Irvine's worst season in the school's 25-year history came to an end 
Wednesday night, with the Anteaters losing to Cal State Fullerton, 82-63, in 
the first round of the Big West Conference tournament at Long Beach Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine finished 5-23. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton, which broke a seven-game losing streak, advances to a quarterfinal 
game against third-ranked Nevada Las Vegas on Friday night at 9. 
</P>
<P>
Some reward: UNLV has eliminated Fullerton (13-15) each of the past five 
tournaments, and has beaten the Titans this season by 28 and 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
In their two games against Irvine during the regular season, the Titans won by 
27 points and lost the second by 18. 
</P>
<P>
This time they jumped to a 36-16 lead in the first half, and that was about it. 
</P>
<P>
For the only time this season, Fullerton started a game without Cedric Ceballos 
on the court. Coach John Sneed benched him for the first four minutes for being 
late to Tuesday's practice. 
</P>
<P>
Ceballos, who wore a black armband with the name "Hank" on it, said he was late 
after attending the memorial service for Hank Gathers, who was his teammate on 
a summer league team at Cal State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Ceballos finished with 19 points and 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Hill led Fullerton with 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters suffered another poor shooting performance. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, Irvine missed all nine shots from three-point range. 
Fullerton made seven of 11, including all three attempts by Van Anderson, a 
reserve forward who averages three points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Irvine made only 41% of its shots. Discounting center Ricky Butler, 
who scored 22 points on 10-of-14 shooting, the Anteaters made only 16 of 50 
shots -- 32%. 
</P>
<P>
From the free-throw line, they made only six of 13 -- 46%. 
</P>
<P>
And Dylan Rigdon, unflappable and unstoppable in the previous game, made only 
one shot, a layup, and missed all five of his shots from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
Rod Palmer, the only senior starter for the Anteaters, added 20 points, 
including five three-point baskets. 
</P>
<P>
"Unbelievable," Sneed said of the Titans' performance. "It couldn't have come 
at a better time." 
</P>
<P>
Just in time for a game against UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan, pressed for a prediction on the UNLV-Fullerton 
game, tried to be diplomatic. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to get into that," he said. "I don't know, you know, maybe they 
can hang in there and do a good job. . . . I think Vegas is a Final Four team. 
I've said that all along." 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State 71, San Jose State 56 -- Tod Bernard scored Fresno State's first 
13 points of the second half as the Bulldogs ended a seven-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State (10-18) will play top-seeded New Mexico State on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard made three three-point shots during his streak as the Bulldogs 
increased a 30-27 halftime lead to 43-33. He finished with 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
"We had one of our poorest games of the season," said San Jose State Coach Stan 
Morrison. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose State (8-20) shot only 35% from the field and made 23 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans, who were led by Andre Brooks' 19 points, got to within 44-42, but 
Fresno quickly pulled away on a basket by Bernard and five points in a row by 
Pat Riddlesprigger. 
</P>
<P>
Tournament Notes 
</P>
<P>
Larry Johnson of Nevada Las Vegas was chosen the Big West Conference Player of 
the Year by a coaches' vote. UNLV's Stacey Augmon, last year's Player of the 
Year, didn't make the first or second team, earning only honorable mention. . . 
. There is hope for the future for Irvine, which placed two players on the 
all-freshman team: Dylan Rigdon and Jeff Von Lutzow. Other members: Lucious 
Harris of Cal State Long Beach, Idris Jones of UC Santa Barbara and Kevin Logan 
of San Jose State.

THE DEATH OF HANK GATHERS; 
</P>
<P>
GATHERS TOUCHED THOSE WHO KNEW HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was in a hotel lobby somewhere on the road and I was trying to track down my 
5-year-old. The lobby was small enough that I could hear clearly a resonant 
voice call out: "My main man, come on in." 
</P>
<P>
That was when I spotted my son peering through the slightly ajar door to a room 
set aside for the Loyola Marymount basketball team's pregame meal. By the time 
I reached him, the boy had already been introduced to the entire team, was 
seated next to his new friend and was being asked his prediction on that 
night's game. A hero was born. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, a different lobby, this one in a hospital, and a different 
voice, telling me that the hero was gone, that he had literally played his 
heart out. As I walked away, concerned how I would explain such mortal things 
to a child, my shivering found a momentary refuge as I recalled the warmth of 
that hotel encounter with Hank Gathers. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it is just as well that many who stood to gain the most from his 
acquaintance will never have to suffer the loss that those who knew him now 
feel. I think of all the kids in NBA cities who will never have to miss his 
infectious smile and friendly chatter, who may never have to learn that heroes, 
no matter how strong, can leave us. Who will never have to learn to accept the 
realization that when Hank Gathers autographed your program, he also made his 
mark on your heart, indelibly.

BIG WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S TOURNAMENT; 
</P>
<P>
PACIFIC HANDS IRVINE 24TH LOSS IN ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The University of the Pacific women's basketball team defeated UC Irvine, 
71-51, Wednesday before only 121 in the first round of the Big West Conference 
tournament at Long Beach Arena. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Anteaters' 27th loss in 28 games and their 24th in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Both are school records. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's only victory this season was a 59-57 win over Southern Utah State on 
Dec. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Center Julie Szukalski scored 19 points and guard Charmon Logan had 15 to lead 
Pacific (14-14), which meets Hawaii today at 3 p.m. Kathy Lizarraga and Jenny 
Lee, both guards, had 12 each to lead UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters had 35 turnovers and shot 35.2% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose State 81, San Diego State 59 -- Hulett Brooks had 22 points, making 
nine of 12 shots from the field, to lead San Jose State. Lora Alexander added 
20 points and 16 rebounds for the Spartans. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose (5-23) advances to play top-seeded Nevada Las Vegas at 7 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans led only 34-27 at halftime, but gradually pulled away in the

MIRA COSTA STARTS OUT NO. 1 IN NATION, WILL IT BE BLESSING OR BURDEN?; 
</P>
<P>
VOLLEYBALL: THE MUSTANGS' TOP SETTER, CANYON CEMAN, SAYS IT'S A COMPLIMENT AND 
THE TEAM DESERVES IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART MATTHEWS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
One is both a positive and a negative number at Mira Costa High School. 
</P>
<P>
One happens to be Mira Costa's national ranking in boys volleyball, courtesy of 
USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon Ceman, Mira Costa's highly recruited setter, says the top spot is one 
the Mustangs deserve. Ceman is studying advanced-placement calculus this term 
and has a 4.0 grade-point average, so he knows his numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"You can look at a No. 1 ranking as either a burden or a compliment," Ceman 
said. "I consider it a compliment. If your goal is to be No. 1 by the end of 
the season, then it's nice to start out the year there." 
</P>
<P>
One is also the number of games Mira Costa lost last season -- and a number it 
hopes to avoid this time around. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs went 21-1 last year, losing only to an inspired Corona del Mar 
team in the Southern Section 4-A championship match. 
</P>
<P>
"That game was a heartbreak for us," said Pat Ivie, Mira Costa's 6-foot-5 
middle blocker. "We dedicated our entire off-season to making sure that there 
was no way that would happen again." 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa Coach Mike Cook has a tradition of turning out top-notch volleyball 
teams. The Mustangs went 22-0 en route to the 4-A championship in 1984, and 
21-1 in both 1987 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Cook, who has won either Ocean or Bay League championships in all but one of 
his 10 years at the school, says this year's team could be the best ever. 
</P>
<P>
But he's hedging his bets a little about the national ranking. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't come and talk to me about it," Cook said. "But I'm not 
sandbagging. We have really quality people, and if they play to their 
potential, we deserve the ranking." 
</P>
<P>
Leading the way for Mira Costa this season are three returning starters: 
</P>
<P>
Ivie, who has good volleyball genes. His brother, Bryan, a 1987 Mira Costa 
graduate, is at USC and will play volleyball for the United States in the 1992 
Olympic Games at Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his size, Ivie moves well in the back row and can go to the floor for 
digs. He also owns a devastating jump serve. In Mira Costa's 15-1, 15-8, 15-8 
season-opening victory over Loyola last Friday, Ivie served for 12 points, 
including five aces. 
</P>
<P>
"Jump serves are just as good as kills," Cook said. "Only they come from the 
service line." 
</P>
<P>
David Swatik, a 6-4 outside hitter who was a first-team All-CIF choice and most 
valuable player in the Ocean League last season. 
</P>
<P>
Swatik, a ferocious but consistent spiker, comes after opposing teams 
left-handed. He forces them into different blocking and digging patterns, and 
usually by the time they come up with a solution, it's too late. 
</P>
<P>
"David is the strongest hitter in our league, without a doubt," Cook said. "For 
us, his role is to pass the ball and put it away. Pass and bang." 
</P>
<P>
The cool-handed Ceman, a 6-4 setter who may be the best of the bunch. 
</P>
<P>
Ceman calls verbal signals to his teammates during play and sets up plays with 
hand signals before the serve. His height also makes him a plus on the front 
row as a hitter. 
</P>
<P>
"Canyon is the quarterback of our team," Cook said. "That 4.0 mind that he's 
got really helps out. He doesn't do a lot of dumb stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa also has 6-7 Mike Ashenfelter, a teammate of Ceman's on the Mustang 
basketball team, to help out as a middle blocker and power server. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Shoptaw, a 6-3 junior, mans the other outside hitter position. He's Mira 
Costa's "chatter man," keeping the Mustangs alive with positive talk, passing 
and defense. Cook expects Shoptaw to be a major-college prospect next year. 
</P>
<P>
The only small position for Mira Costa is the other setter. Seniors Brian 
Thurston and Craig Beck, both under 6 feet, are battling for that spot. Reserve 
Frank Guernsey, a senior, gives the Mustangs some valuable defense on the back 
row. 
</P>
<P>
"This team aspires to be able to call itself the best team Mira Costa has ever 
had," Cook said. "But they've got to earn the wins to make that happen." 
</P>
<P>
Ivie takes that sentiment a step further. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be the best high school team that has ever played," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs have the talent. Last summer, both Swatik and Ceman were invited 
to Norman, Okla., for the U.S. Olympic Festival. Olympic Festival teams are 
composed mostly of college starters, either freshmen or sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
Ceman started for the West team and won a gold medal. Swatik, then 16 and one 
of the youngest athletes at the festival, earned a bronze medal as a starter on 
the North team. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of the best learning experiences of my life," Swatik said. "Most of 
the college players didn't like having a 16-year-old on the team. For the first 
week, I had no friends." 
</P>
<P>
But once the lanky left-hander proved his ability on the court with a few 
wicked spikes, the older players warmed up to him. 
</P>
<P>
After returning from Oklahoma, Ceman and Swatik warmed up to the two-man beach 
volleyball scene. When they arrived, they found that Ivie had already earned 
his Class A rating in the California Beach Volleyball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Ceman and Swatik started the summer as B-rated players, but after winning a 
beach tournament together in Playa del Rey in mid-September, they improved to 
AA ratings. 
</P>
<P>
An AAA amateur rating is the stepping stone to the lucrative world of 
professional two-man beach volleyball. Ceman and Swatik are only a rung away. 
</P>
<P>
"The beach is great because it develops all the volleyball fundamentals," Cook 
said. "Everyone has to be able to pass, spike, set, block and serve. With only 
two guys, you can't hide anybody in the back row." 
</P>
<P>
Ceman and Swatik have been two-man teammates for several years now. Their 
skills, like those of the famed pro team of Tim Hovland and Mike Dodd, 
complement each other: Swatik is a big blocker, Ceman an accomplished defender. 
</P>
<P>
"It pays to be a well-rounded player on the beach," Ceman said. "If you're not, 
you get served every time. That's why most beach schools are more advanced 
fundamentally than the inland schools. You have to be able to do it all." 
</P>
<P>
The do-it-all trio of Ivie, Swatik and Ceman has made Mira Costa a one-stop 
dream for college recruiters. All three are being wooed by the major volleyball 
powerhouses -- USC, UCLA, UC Santa Barbara, Stanford and Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
All three have legitimate shots at making the 1996 Olympic team. They could 
also have professional careers, either in Europe or on the beach, with Ceman 
and Swatik likely to remain a two-man tandem after college. 
</P>
<P>
But for now, the entire Mira Costa team is set on holding onto one No. 1 and 
erasing the other. 
</P>
<P>
"We talk about it every day in practice," Swatik said. "We want to achieve 
everyone's expectations. We like the pressure. It brings everyone's performance 
to another level." 
</P>
<P>
If there is a level higher than the top.

EL CAMINO WILL MEET NORTH'S TOP SEED IN PLAYOFFS

<P>
El Camino College's spectacular road show will play at UC Irvine this afternoon 
when the state's Final Eight Junior College Basketball Tournament gets under 
way. 
</P>
<P>
The road has been kind to the Warriors, who have a three-game playoff winning 
streak against higher-ranked teams. 
</P>
<P>
Today at 5 p.m., El Camino, seeded fourth in the South, will meet West Valley 
of Saratoga, the North's top seed, at the Bren Event Center on the Irvine 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
West Valley is a good shooting team that runs well and plays a tough zone 
defense. The Vikings won the Golden Gate Conference title and hold an 
impressive 29-2 record. They are led by all-conference guard Craig Holt, who 
signed with Loyola Marymount University earlier this season, and 6-foot-7 
forward Brian Killian, a solid outside shooter. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Coach Ron McClurkin said his team is ready to face the Vikings, who 
defeated Sacramento and Columbia en route to this weekend's tournament. 
</P>
<P>
After all, the Warriors had to overcome long odds just to get to the final 
eight. El Camino (23-10) was seeded 23rd in the South Regional playoffs before 
upsetting No. 10 Santa Monica, No. 7 L.A. City College and finally No. 2 
Cypress on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is ready to go," McClurkin said Tuesday. "We had a great practice 
yesterday, and we're very hyped up. No one has let down. We're still very 
intense." 
</P>
<P>
That's been the case with El Camino's offense through the playoffs. At least 
four players have scored in double figures in every game. Sophomore Larry 
Lockley leads the team with an 18.6-point average in the playoffs. The 
all-conference guard scored 23 points in El Camino's 80-71 win over Cypress and 
21 against Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore forwards David Keeter and Steve Leary have each averaged 14 points a 
game in the playoffs. Both had their best post-season performances against L.A. 
City. Keeter (6-5, 185 pounds) had 23 points, and Leary ((6-8, 200) had 17. 
</P>
<P>
"They've capped off the season with a trip to Irvine," McClurkin said of his 
players, "and now they want to cap off the trip to Irvine with a championship." 
</P>
<P>
If the Warriors get past West Valley, they'll face the winner of tonight's 
Rancho Santiago-American River game Friday at 8 p.m. Rancho (29-3) is the 
South's second-seeded team, and American River (24-12) is seeded third in the 
North.

MORNINGSIDE, PALOS VERDES MAKE BIDS FOR FINALS BERTHS

<P>
Morningside and Palos Verdes high schools, the only South Bay basketball teams 
still in contention for state titles, will play home games tonight at 7:30 in 
the Southern California girls regional semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Morningside (29-3) meets Mt. Carmel of San Diego (23-5) in a 
Division I match-up, while Palos Verdes (28-5) faces Costa Mesa (18-11) in a 
Division III game. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes Coach Wendell Yoshida was happy his team bounced back Tuesday with 
a 53-37 victory over San Diego's Our Lady of Peace in the first round of the 
regionals. It came one game after the Sea Kings lost to Brea-Olinda, 50-33, in 
the Southern Section 3-AA finals last week. 
</P>
<P>
"We hated to end the (Southern Section) season not playing well," Yoshida said. 
"We had a good season. But one bad game, especially the last one, can leave a 
bad taste in your mouth. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives us a reprieve, a second life." 
</P>
<P>
As usual, the Sea Kings received a balanced effort against Our Lady of Peace, 
the San Diego champion. Guard Lisa Humphreys had a triple-double of 13 points, 
14 rebounds and 10 assists; sophomore center Monique Morehouse had 10 points, 
11 rebounds and five blocked shots; forward Kristen Jaconi had 12 points and 
seven rebounds, and point guard Susan Wilhite played a "great floor game," 
according to Yoshida. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa, the Southern Section 3-A champion, advanced with a 44-42 win over 
Selma, the Central Section runner-up. Guard Olivia DiCamilli scored the winning 
basket on a last-second shot and finished with 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's winner advances to the Division III regional final at 9:30 a.m. 
Saturday at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside, gunning for its third consecutive appearance in the State Division 
I final, turned back a stubborn Ventura Buena team Tuesday, 56-49. Center Lisa 
Leslie produced another triple-double of 30 points, 11 rebounds and 13 blocked 
shots despite sitting out part of the game after drawing her fourth foul early 
in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Carmel, the San Diego Section runner-up, defeated Southern Section 5-A 
champion Hart of Newhall, 65-42. 
</P>
<P>
The Division I regional final will be played at 6:30 p.m. Friday at the Sports 
Arena.

TAYLOR SHOWS HE CAN PLAY AT HIGH LEVEL; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: MOORPARK'S 6-4 1/2 CENTER HAS BEEN UP FOR THE STATE 
TOURNAMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The truth should be told: Moorpark College center Greg Taylor is only 6-foot-4 
1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Hardly earthshaking news but nonetheless contrary to his listed height of 6-6 
on the Moorpark basketball roster. 
</P>
<P>
It also is not necessarily surprising. Taylor does not appear to be 6-6, but 
when questioned about the discrepancy, one Moorpark coach said Taylor just 
looked shorter than 6-6 because he's so muscular. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it can hardly be considered good news for Moorpark's opponents. They 
already have had their bodies bruised by Taylor, and now they will have equally 
bruised egos from knowing they have been outhustled, outmuscled and 
outrebounded, usually substantially, by a man 6-4 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
How must the Santa Barbara players feel? Taylor grabbed a Moorpark 
school-record 27 rebounds against them last season. What about the rest of the 
Western State Conference? Taylor, who is shorter than dozens of opposing 
players, was the leading rebounder in the conference with an 11.4 average -- no 
small feat. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than being a discredit to Moorpark opponents, though, the fact that 
Taylor almost invariably has pummeled them is more a credit to his intensity, 
desire and work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
"When I see that ball hit the rim, I want it," said Taylor, who has never 
fouled out of a Moorpark game. "I think I want it worse than anybody on the 
opposing team. 
</P>
<P>
"Once I'm feeling good and my momentum is going well and I feel like I'm hyped, 
rebounds just come. I just go after everything. . . . Some nights I feel like I 
could get every rebound that hits the rim." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Taylor is better on the rebound than Liz Taylor (no relation). He ranked 
fourth in the state and has worked his way up to third on the Moorpark career 
rebounding list. He will take over second on the school single-season list with 
10 or more rebounds in today's 3 p.m. game against Chabot in the state 
tournament quarterfinals at UC Irvine's Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
An imposing presence on the court, Taylor plays at a rock-solid 220 pounds. His 
scowl is a permanent feature of his game face, and his mien is capped by a 
flattop rising above his shaved skull. 
</P>
<P>
Wait a minute, though, what's that ponytail doing there? 
</P>
<P>
Square in the back of his head is a curly little, disarmingly fragile ponytail. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, there is more to Taylor than first meets the eye. Like the ponytail 
cavorting behind the intimidating haircut, a kinder, gentler man hides behind 
the fearsome on-court demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
He was so homesick for his native Louisiana that he almost left Moorpark after 
his freshman season. His mother, Beulah Taylor, moved to Kansas City several 
years ago, and, although they have stayed in close touch, Greg has not seen her 
for two years. 
</P>
<P>
"I miss her a whole lot, and I really want her to see me play," Taylor said. 
"I've never had a chance to play in front of her." 
</P>
<P>
Beulah Taylor's job as a nurse made it difficult to see her son play, and Greg 
moved in with an uncle in Texas as a high school sophomore to pursue his 
basketball career at Houston power Yates High. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a football player, but I fell in love with basketball, and I didn't want 
to play football anymore," said Taylor, a quarterback at Bolton High in 
Alexandria, La. "The coaches there told me if I didn't play football that they 
wouldn't let me play basketball. . . . So I left and I went to Texas." 
</P>
<P>
The Moorpark football coaches would love to put Taylor at tight end, but, after 
briefly considering going out for the team, Taylor decided the risk of injury 
was too great. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, Moorpark's captain, leads by example. He is the team's third-leading 
scorer (12 ppg. on 60.2% shooting), and he has lifted his play a notch for the 
playoffs. Taylor grabbed 16 rebounds in a tournament-opening victory over 
Orange Coast, and his 20 points and 13 rebounds Saturday night against Golden 
West helped put Moorpark into the final eight. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor recently was named All-WSC Northern Division and was honorable-mention 
all-conference last season. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, now 21, injured his right knee during his senior season in high school 
and missed a few years of competitive basketball before joining the Job Corps 
and returning to the game. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor seldom shoots beyond an arm's length of the basket. Guards Sam Crawford 
and Roger Thomas are Moorpark's primary scorers, and Taylor's shot selection is 
an implicit recognition of his weaknesses and strengths as well as an 
indication of his unselfishness. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather be in the paint. If I take a 15-footer and I miss it, there's 
nobody there," Taylor said. "I feel that if I'm playing hard and rebounding 
well, the rest of the team plays well also." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's rebounding prowess has drawn interest from such Division I schools as 
Lamar and New Mexico State as well as Cal State Northridge, but Taylor first 
plans to complete his Associate of Arts degree at Moorpark.

In another game: 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran 9, The Master's 7 -- Starting pitcher Rick Simpson of Master's 
took a one-hitter and a 7-3 lead into the bottom of the seventh. But when the 
inning was over, Simpson was gone and CLU was in front, 8-7, on its way to an 
NAIA District 3 win. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Leonhardt had two of CLU's four hits in the game, knocking in four runs 
with a home run and a double. 
</P>
<P>
The Master's led, 5-1, after three innings and held a 7-3 advantage entering 
the bottom of the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
But Cal Lutheran (7-4, 4-1) took advantage of five walks in the inning to score 
five runs. The Kingsmen had just two hits in the rally but sent 10 batters to 
the plate. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Weis hit a bases-loaded single to score two, and three more scored on 
Leonhardt's blast over the left-field wall. The Kingsmen added another run on 
Darnell Mitchell's solo shot in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Johnson was four for five for Master's (5-10, 2-4), including a home run 
and two doubles to pace a 12-hit attack. 
</P>
<P>
Master's had runners at first and second with two out in the ninth, but Chris 
Matkin retired Matt Henzie on a fly ball to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We're used to trailing," Cal Lutheran Coach Rich Hill said. "It seems like we 
fall behind every game, but we have tremendous confidence in our ability to 
come back." 
</P>
<P>
Added Leonhardt: "We never feel that we're out of a ballgame. We were hitting 
the ball well. It was just a matter of time. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a saying that seven-eight-nine is Kingsmen time." 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran scored its first run without the benefit of a hit. 
</P>
<P>
Devon Schultzer walked to start the second inning and scored on Peter 
Washington's groundout. The Kingsmen capitalized on two errors in the sixth to 
add two more runs on two hits. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran starter Martin Clark pitched 4 2/3 innings, striking out four and 
walking one, but the win went to Mike Rooney (1-0), who came on in the fifth. 
He was replaced by Matkin in the ninth. KIRBY LEE

Hart 2, Crespi 1 -- An eighth-inning, bases-loaded walk to R. J. Simone was the 
difference for the host Indians in a third-round game of the El Segundo 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Hart (3-0) loaded the bases against reliever Ryan Staley (0-1), who replaced 
Pat Bennett after seven strong innings. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, a senior right-hander who was 4-8 last season, yielded only two hits 
and struck out five. He tired, however, and gave way to Staley, who yielded a 
bloop single to Doug Distaso, hit Lance Migita with a pitch and, after both 
runners advanced on a sacrifice bunt, intentionally walked Rob Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Staley then struck out Keith Halcovich on three pitches but walked Simone in 
five. 
</P>
<P>
Hart collected only three hits but capitalized on a costly error by left 
fielder Mark Venturine on a fly ball in the fifth inning that allowed the 
Indians to tie the score, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't hit water if we fell out of a boat," Hart Coach Bud Murray said. "But 
we'll get better with the hitting." 
</P>
<P>
Left-hander Andrew Lorraine relieved Halcovich after five innings and struck 
out five en route to his second win without a loss. VINCE KOWALICK

POLY SQUEAKS PAST SYLMAR IN EAST VALLEY OPENER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two teams that played three-one run games against each other last season met 
again Wednesday in an East Valley League opener. After three hours, the setting 
of the sun and another one-run decision, what do you have? 
</P>
<P>
"Typical Sylmar-Poly," Sylmar Coach Gary Donatella said. 
</P>
<P>
In a game pitting the top two league title contenders against each other, Poly 
emerged with a 7-6 victory at Sylmar. The game was called because of darkness 
after six innings. 
</P>
<P>
That the game came down to one run was to Sylmar's credit. Poly forged an early 
5-1 lead in the third inning when Rodrigo Dorame (three runs batted in) hit a 
two-run home run off loser James Encinas (1-1). 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth inning, Poly's Gabe Chavez (three RBIs) increased the lead to 6-1 
with a single that scored Roy Lozano, who had two hits and scored two runs for 
the Parrots (3-2). 
</P>
<P>
Sylmar (2-2) then jumped on eventual winner Eddie Castellanos (3-0) for three 
runs in the bottom of the fourth as David Romero and Billy Garcia rapped 
run-scoring singles and Robert Garcia hit a sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 7-4 in the bottom of the fifth, Sylmar again stormed back. Ben Soliz 
knocked out an RBI single and pinch-hitter Pat Garcia had an RBI single. With 
the score 7-6 and runners on first and third and one out, Encinas looped a ball 
to Poly second baseman Lozano, who speared it and doubled off Garcia to end the 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
Poly, which had stranded 43 runners in its previous four games, left the bases 
loaded in each of the final four innings. BRIAN MURPHY

After battling Division I opponents for the past month, Cal State Northridge 
made its 1990 debut against Division II competition Wednesday at Cal Poly San 
Luis Obispo and defeated the Mustangs, 2-1 and 2-1, as the teams opened their 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. softball schedules. 
</P>
<P>
In the first game, Lisa Erickson, who reached base on an infield single, scored 
the winning run from second base on a ninth-inning throwing error. 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Leilani Artis had driven in Jeanne Mixon in the second to tie the 
score, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Dickmann went the distance and struck out four to improve her record to 
4-4. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs (7-7) committed seven errors in the nightcap. Northridge took a 
2-0 advantage in the second after Mixon scored on Denise Swank's single and 
Anna Getherall, who had reached base on a single, came home on an error.

COLEMAN THROWS NO-HITTER FOR ORANGE GLEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scott Coleman pitched a no-hitter to lead Orange Glen to a 7-0 victory over San 
Dieguito in the Warhawk tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Combined with four no-hit innings Coleman threw Saturday before being lifted 
because he had reached his predetermined limit of 80 pitches, he now has 11 
consecutive hitless innings. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman, a senior, struck out 10 against San Dieguito and nine Saturday in the 
14-0 victory over Mar Vista. 
</P>
<P>
John Bowerman went three for three with a home run and Jim Roby was three for 
four for Orange Glen. 
</P>
<P>
In other Warhawk games: 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater 2, Castle Park 1 -- Pitcher Raul Sanchez had a perfect game going 
for four innings. He not only got the victory by pitching the first five 
innings, he got the save by coming back in the seventh to get the final two 
outs. 
</P>
<P>
And that's not all. Sanchez also drove in both runs for Sweetwater (3-0), going 
three for three with a triple. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Mesa 10, Carlsbad 4 -- Beau Champoux had four RBIs on three singles and 
scored twice for Mira Mesa (3-0). 
</P>
<P>
Hoover 12, Mt. Miguel 7 -- D.C. Jacobs had four RBIs, going two for three 
including a bases-loaded double. Roger Blake went two for two and had three 
RBIs. Hoover is 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
Kearny 10, Serra 6 -- Jason Rodondo went three for four with two RBIs. Rob 
Fragoso was the winning pitcher, striking out four, and went two for three with 
an RBI. Kearny is 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Bonita Vista 7, Point Loma 4 -- Mike Barnett went 3 for 3 with four RBIs to 
lead the Barons (1-2). Point Loma dropped to 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
Madison 17, Mar Vista 3 -- Robbie Hoffman went two for four with a grand slam 
to highlight an 11-run fifth for Madison (2-1). Matt Campbell added three hits 
with four RBIs. Gabe Roberts pitched a one-hitter through six innings for the 
victory. Mar Vista dropped to 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
In the Reyman-Pirate tournament: 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont 11, El Camino 1 -- The game featured four home runs, by Grossmont's 
Todd Cady, Greg Layson and Scott Brennan and El Camino's Ricky Spears. 
Grossmont center fielder Lenny Van Avery was three for three with two RBIs. 
Grossmont is 4-0, El Camino 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
San Pasqual 14, Laguna Beach 6 -- Dave Vejtasa went three for three with two 
RBIs, and teammate Sam Macari hit a bases-empty home run. Pitcher Shawn Brooks 
had seven strikeouts in 3 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Buena Vista 9, Oceanside 9 -- Four RBV players collected three hits: 
James Gore, who added three RBIs, Steve Valencia and Kevin Leppert. Terry 
Vaughn was three for four with four RBIs for Oceanside (1-0-1). 
</P>
<P>
Ramona 6, Torrey Pines 4 -- Ramona scored four unearned runs after what would 
have been the third out on a strikeout in the fifth inning. The Bulldogs' (1-1) 
good fortune made a loser of Anthony Napoli, who carried a no-hitter into the 
fifth inning. He had nine strikeouts through 4 2/3 innings for the Falcons 
(1-1). Mark Swaim led Torrey with two hits. 
</P>
<P>
Fallbrook 5, Temecula Valley 3 -- Dan Furleigh doubled and had three RBIs, and 
Jeremy Fitzgerald had three hits for the Warriors (2-0). Sophomore Steve Pack 
pitched a five-hitter with no earned runs. 
</P>
<P>
Nonleague 
</P>
<P>
Marian 7, Bishop's 4 -- Giancarlo Ruiz had a two-out, two-RBI single to tie the 
game in the fourth, and Jose Iniguez drove in two in the sixth to give Marian 
the lead.

COMPUTER FILE: CD TURNS YOUR PC INTO A MULTIMEDIA CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

analyst and writer.

Compact discs have already taken over the record industry. Now they're about to 
invade your computer. 
</P>
<P>
The same type of CD used to store music can also store computer data -- up to 
600 megabytes per disc. With that much available data, a personal computer can 
become a desktop library. And it's not limited to just words and numbers. 
Thanks to CDs, personal computers also can function as multimedia centers, able 
to reproduce sound, graphics, photographs, animation and moving video. 
</P>
<P>
A CD-ROM, which stands for compact disc read only memory, is a 5-inch round 
disc identical to the CDs that have virtually replaced phonograph records as 
the media of choice for music buffs. In fact, most computer CD drives, or 
players, can also play music discs, provided that they are connected to a home 
stereo or other sound system. 
</P>
<P>
CDs can store 15 times as much as a 40-megabyte hard disk or the equivalent of 
nearly 1,700 of the 360-kilobyte floppy disks that are typically used to 
distribute software and data for IBM-compatible PCs. 
</P>
<P>
However, unlike regular disks, CDs are "read only." The data is permanently 
encoded. They cannot be erased or modified. As a result, they are not suitable 
to store a user's data and are not a substitute for hard or floppy disks. A CD 
drive can be added to most IBM-compatible and Macintosh computers. Computers 
require special CD data drives; standard audio models will not work. 
</P>
<P>
Because they hold so much data and because they can also hold software, they 
are an excellent publishing medium. A single disc can replace a wall of books, 
storing an entire encyclopedia, a set of huge reference manuals or a company's 
entire parts list. In volume, they cost under $2 to duplicate and are 
inexpensive to ship. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to CD-ROMs and a new generation of hardware and software, computers are 
no longer limited to the dimension of words and numbers. They are becoming 
multimedia tools. Whether at the office or at home, a single PC can now inform 
and entertain you with pictures, animation, sound, graphics and video. 
</P>
<P>
Now there are more than 300,000 computers equipped with CD drives and about 
2,500 commercial CD titles, according to Nick Arnett, president of Multimedia 
Computing, an industry publishing and consulting firm. The number of drives and 
titles have both about doubled in the last year, according to Arnett. 
</P>
<P>
Most selections are large compendiums of data such as "Medical Year Book 
Library," "Automatic Patent Searching" or "Birds of America." 
</P>
<P>
A handful are games that take advantage of the technology by storing large 
video and audio files. "Cosmic Osmos" and "The Manhole" from MediaGenic take a 
child or adult on a long fantasy into mysterious worlds with vivid stereo sound 
effects. CDs are even being used to replace maps. Electromap of Fayetteville, 
Ark., publishes a world atlas with 239 full-color maps covering every country 
in the world. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a growing number of organizations are using CDs to store and 
disseminate their own information. I met a representative of the Social 
Security Administration who hopes to secure funding to transfer the agency's 
procedure manuals to CD format. 
</P>
<P>
Entire encyclopedias can -- and do -- fit on a single CD. The 1990 version of 
"The New Grolier Electronic Encyclopedia," complete with 33,000 articles and 
more than 1,000 color illustrations, will be released in April for both 
IBM-compatible and Apple Macintosh systems. The suggested price is $395 plus $4 
shipping. Grolier can be reached at (800) 356-5590. 
</P>
<P>
Britannica Software publishes an electronic encyclopedia called "Compton's 
MultiMedia Encyclopedia." Delivered on a single compact disc, it contains 
nearly 9 million words, 5,200 articles, 15,000 photographs, charts and 
diagrams, 60 minutes of audio and 45 separate animation sequences. There is 
even room left over for the 65,000-word Merriam-Webster Intermediate 
Dictionary. 
</P>
<P>
Pictures and sound make entries come to life. Look up Mozart and you'll not 
only read about him but see his picture and hear his music. Look up the knee 
joint and you'll see it move. The concept is interesting and many of the 
features are quite useful. 
</P>
<P>
But I was not impressed with the "look" of the product. The text is displayed 
as white against a blue background and the pictures are not nearly as crisp as 
what you get in the printed edition. Some CDs, such as "National Geographic 
Society's Encyclopedia of Mammals" (a work in progress) include gorgeous color 
photographs. The suggested retail price is $895. Britannica Software can be 
reached at (800) 533-0130. 
</P>
<P>
Sony is equipping selected record stores with a Sony PC (IBM-compatible) 
equipped with a CD drive and a special interface board. On the screen is a 
listing of popular artists. Customers use a pointing device to select an artist 
and get a complete list of his or her recordings. When they make a selection, 
they not only hear it, but see a short "music video" on a replica of a tiny TV 
set (about 2 inches square) on the PC's screen. 
</P>
<P>
Sony's special interface board makes it possible to integrate the audio with 
the text and graphics. The CD-XA board will be available in the United States 
later this year at a cost of between $300 and $400. It requires a CD drive 
(starting at about $600) as well as a PC equipped with a VGA (video graphics 
array) monitor. 
</P>
<P>
Sony has no plans to export its record store demo discs to the United States 
but it is encouraging U.S. software and entertainment companies to develop 
their own discs. The company envisions it being used for business, 
entertainment, training, education and other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The moving video display is still rather crude at eight frames per second, far 
short of the 30-frame-per-second standard U.S. television. What's more, the 
image is typically displayed in a small window on the screen. Video images take 
up a great deal of memory -- the larger the image, the more memory required. 
</P>
<P>
The Sony products are among the first to use the new CD-XA format. Other 
companies supporting that format include Microsoft, IBM, Fujitsu and Olivetti. 
Fujitsu has incorporated an optional CD-XA board in its new multimedia PC. 
Called FM TOWNS, the system is currently available only in Japan for $3,000 to 
$5,000, depending on configuration. For information call (415) 928-7270. 
</P>
<P>
Another technology, called DVI or Digital Video Interactive, enables a PC with 
a CD drive to display "VCR-quality" full-motion video along with sound, 
graphics and text. Moving pictures take up an enormous amount of storage space 
but thanks to DVI compression techniques it is now possible to store about 72 
minutes of full-screen video on a single CD. To play it back, however, requires 
that the computer be equipped with a special board that decompresses the data 
as it is displayed. 
</P>
<P>
As compression and CD technology improve, it is likely that you'll be able to 
play full-length motion pictures on your personal computer. That's the day when 
the home computer takes its rightful place in the living room -- as part of 
your home entertainment, information, learning and productivity center.

ARCHIVE CORP., CIPHER MOVE CLOSER TO MERGER; 
</P>
<P>
NEGOTIATIONS: THE COMPUTER TAPE-DRIVE COMPANIES HAVE AGREED TO DISCUSS CIPHER'S 
ACQUISITION.

Archive Corp.'s effort to take over Cipher Data Products of San Diego took a 
step forward Wednesday when the two companies announced an agreement to 
negotiate an acquisition of Cipher by Archive at $8.25 per share. 
</P>
<P>
Archive launched a $109-million, $7.50 per share hostile tender offer for all 
Cipher shares last December, and since then the companies have been engaged in 
on-again, off-again merger negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The companies, fierce competitors in the market for computer tape-drives, which 
are used to make back-up copies of computer data, at one point agreed to 
consider $8 a share. But those talks broke down. 
</P>
<P>
Tag Merrick, an attorney for Archive, said the agreement to negotiate the deal 
at a higher price is a positive step toward a merger. He would not comment 
further and Cipher officials declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
More than 85% of Cipher's outstanding shares have been tendered to Archive, but 
a takeover has been blocked by Cipher's "poison pill" defense, which would 
dilute the value of the acquired shares in the event of a takeover and make the 
buyout prohibitively expensive. 
</P>
<P>
The poison pill also blocks a takeover until outstanding patent litigation 
between the two companies is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Archive sought a temporary restraining order to nullify the poison pill, but a 
San Diego judge refused the request. 
</P>
<P>
Archive has extended the tender offer several times and continued its efforts 
to get Cipher to agree to a takeover. Cipher has said it was negotiating with 
other possible buyers.

CHIPSOFT PUTS MORE BYTE IN ELECTRONIC TAX FILING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM KOWSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because of a new software package offered by ChipSoft, the San Diego company 
that makes the popular tax-preparation software program known as TurboTax, 
individual taxpayers can now arrange to have their returns filed electronically 
without the help of a professional tax preparer. 
</P>
<P>
The software package, called ChipLink, allows TurboTax users to send their 
returns from modems in their own homes to an IRS-approved transmitting company, 
which then electronically files the returns with the Internal Revenue Service. 
Except for participants in one pilot program in Boston, only those taxpayers 
who are owed a refund may file their taxes electronically. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to eliminating a trip to the post office, electronic filing 
shortens the time it takes for the IRS to issue a check to taxpayers. Although 
they must pay extra for the service, taxpayers filing electronically receive a 
receipt by mail and can expect to get a refund check four to six weeks earlier 
than they would by filing by mail. 
</P>
<P>
ChipLink makes market leader ChipSoft the first tax-preparation software 
company to offer electronic filing capabilities for the individual taxpayer, 
and it positions the 5-year-old company for another potentially lucrative 
segment of the tax software industry, which analysts say exceeds $60 million 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
So far this tax season, only about 3,000 individual TurboTax users have 
purchased ChipLink to file their returns electronically. But ChipSoft founder 
and President Michael Chipman said electronic filing may one day be as common 
as the personal computer. 
</P>
<P>
"Tax software is being discovered," said Chipman, 43. "For a lot of people, it 
hasn't occurred to them that they could use their computers to file their 
taxes. But the word is beginning to get out that tax software is extremely 
useful, and it's a rapidly growing market." 
</P>
<P>
Tax attorneys and professional preparers warn that all tax software programs, 
including award-winning TurboTax, have limitations and that taxpayers with 
complicated finances should consult with a professional for personalized 
advice. But they also say that most wage earners who file their taxes on paper 
stand to benefit from tax preparation software -- especially ones that offer 
electronic filing capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
"For the typical salaried employee who thinks of a tax return as being a refund 
item, it's fabulous because it speeds up the time in which that refund is 
issued," said Paul J. Dostart, chair of the tax department of the law firm 
Gray, Cary, Ames &amp; Frye in San Diego. "But electronic filing does not 
obviate the need to have a professional adviser. If you miss a deduction 
because you don't know to add it in, TurboTax is not going to put it in for 
you." 
</P>
<P>
The introduction of ChipLink to the software market this tax season coincided 
with the IRS' decision to give the green light to electronic filing nationwide. 
For the past four years, the IRS has conducted pilot programs to test the 
feasibility of allowing professional tax preparers to file their clients' 
returns electronically. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1989 tax season, some 1.2 million tax returns were filed electronically 
nationwide. Now that the IRS has made electronic filing a national program, the 
numbers of electronically filed returns are soaring. As of Feb. 27, some 2.8 
million tax returns were filed electronically, more than twice the number filed 
electronically by the end of the 1989 tax season. 
</P>
<P>
So far, all the electronically filed returns have been for taxpayers owed a 
refund from the government. A pilot program in Boston is experimenting with the 
possibility of allowing taxpayers who owe the government money to file 
electronically and then pay the debt with a credit card, but IRS officials said 
they do not know when such a service would be available to the taxpaying public 
as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wins through electronic filing," said Kathy Stockham, the 
electronic-filing coordinator for the IRS' Laguna Niguel district, which 
includes San Diego. "The benefits to the government are tremendous, which is 
why we started. The tax preparer benefits because they get to offer another 
service to their clients . . . and taxpayers get a more accurate return." 
</P>
<P>
The electronic filing program has not been glitch-free, however. 
</P>
<P>
This week, a computer tape containing some 53,000 electronically filed tax 
returns that was en route to an IRS computing center was misplaced, delaying 
refunds for electronic filers in the Southeast and Central regions of the 
country by as many as three weeks, said IRS spokeswoman Judith Golden in Laguna 
Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time this has ever happened to electronically filed 
returns," Golden said. "It was an unfortunate mishap, but it only resulted in 
minor delays for a relatively small number of people." 
</P>
<P>
To avoid mistakes and to discourage criminal activity, the IRS requires all 
electronically filed returns to be sent through preapproved transmitting 
companies, rather than allowing individual taxpayers to directly file their 
returns electronically. 
</P>
<P>
Most transmitting companies will accept floppy discs from individuals who have 
worked up their own returns on tax preparation software. But TurboTax users who 
buy the ChipLink software package (suggested retail price: $12) are spared the 
trouble of shopping for a transmitting company because the software links them 
directly to Nelco, an IRS-approved transmitting service based in Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
Nelco, a 38-year-old company that also publishes and distributes tax forms, 
charges TurboTax users $15 to transmit their returns to the IRS. So far this 
tax season, Nelco has electronically filed more than 108,000 returns. Although 
TurboTax customers make up a large part of its business, Nelco accepts returns 
from the customers of more than 50 software vendors, said Nelco marketing 
representative Jeff Watzka. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, privately owned ChipSoft has offered two versions of TurboTax -- a 
standard software package for individuals and a more complicated version, 
complete with client billing capabilities, for professional preparers. 
</P>
<P>
Although exact figures are not available, TurboTax software makes up "the 
lion's share" of the tax preparation software market, followed by Andrew 
Tobias' TaxCut, J. K. Lasser's Your Income Tax and Ask Dan About Your Taxes, 
according to Dataquest analyst Gladys Francis. 
</P>
<P>
"TurboTax is certainly the best one on the market right now as far as the 
public is concerned," Francis said. "They're buying it up." 
</P>
<P>
By the end of this fiscal year ending July 30, ChipSoft expects to post $20 
million in revenue, up nearly 45% from last year's revenue of $14 million. This 
year, total unit sales hit 300,000, a 60% rise from the year before, Chipman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the existence of electronic filing may alert people to the fact they 
can do their taxes on computer," Chipman said. "But since we only see 1% (of 
our customers) signing up for it so far, I wouldn't say it's a big thing yet. 
But my sense is it will grow."

ANTIC SHORT STORIES ARE LIGHTER THAN AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER, TIMES BOOK CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Men Under Water by Ralph Lombreglia (Doubleday: $17.95: 212 pages). 
</P>
<P>
As with most good short-story writers, Ralph Lombreglia's work cuts to the 
bone. In his case, unusually, it is often the funny-bone. 
</P>
<P>
With its careful self-absorption and its circuitry of personal relations so 
complex as to regularly short out, modern life is a trap. A Lombreglia 
protagonist, generally the narrator, has followed so many subtle instructions 
so conscientiously that he has worked himself into passive depression. The way 
out is not more subtlety, but outrageousness. 
</P>
<P>
Outrageousness we get a lot of these days, but it tends to be synthetic; a 
formulaic excess along the lines of a "War of the Roses." The genuine article 
is a rarity. It is not a willed choice. It is logic backed against its will 
into a corner so tight that it has no alternative to leaping out into space. In 
the best stories in "Men Under Water," the leap is not only instructive but 
fun; it is a flying lesson, something learned in the air. 
</P>
<P>
The narrator in "Jungle Video," one of the best of the stories, gets out of his 
corner with the help of the three antic spirits he works for. Anita, Dwight and 
the Professor make videos in a broken-down house in Boston. The narrator, 
aimless and inhibited, lives downstairs as their tenant. Before long, they hire 
him as a writer. 
</P>
<P>
He is skillful but conventional; they are moonbeams. A computer company hires 
them to do a video to promote its image. They prepare a straightforward 
treatment; then they rip it apart in the wild, far-out style they win prizes 
for. The company representative is furious; the video doesn't even show his 
president. It is a frequent tribal custom, the Professor -- an anthropologist 
-- explains loftily, that the chief does not take part in the ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, they will redo it. Meanwhile, they clue in the bewildered 
narrator. Clients don't know what they want, Dwight explains, but they think 
that they do. If you do what they think they want, instead of what you know you 
should do, they will be disappointed. Even if they're not, you will be. The 
point is not to make videos but to be "brilliant media wizards." 
</P>
<P>
They all go to a video-game arcade and play a game in which an ape has to pick 
up a proliferating array of bananas. Of course, Dwight explains, it's not the 
ape who does it but the players. "But in seeing it as the ape's situation you 
get this peculiar distance on yourself." 
</P>
<P>
"It becomes something apart from you," the narrator ventures. 
</P>
<P>
"You become something apart from you." 
</P>
<P>
"You become the ape." 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Dwight says. 
</P>
<P>
By the end, the narrator, dressed in a gorilla suit, is cavorting uninhibitedly 
as the subject for the trio's even wilder remake of the company video. He has 
freed himself; he has also become the ape. Lombreglia's message cuts cheerfully 
both ways. 
</P>
<P>
In "Good Year," two lovers, on the verge of a depressive separation, drive out 
to visit friends in the country. On the way, their spirits lift momentarily 
when they catch sight of the Goodyear blimp floating by, silvery and 
improbable. The narrator gets out to watch, and his girlfriend is "tickled by 
how much I like it." 
</P>
<P>
The friends, whose exuberance is on the order of the video trio's, drive them 
later that day to the field where the blimp is moored. The husband has put on a 
kid's space helmet and carries a toy ray-gun; he performs a mock marriage 
ceremony for the low-spirited couple. 
</P>
<P>
" 'I have here two sample earthlings,' " he intones to the blimp. " 'They have 
not been happy on this planet, and have volunteered to leave. I offer them in 
exchange for information about your world. Take us to your leader.' " If blimps 
can tug upward, why not people? 
</P>
<P>
Most of the stories have an equivalent moment of breaking free. Two or three 
seem a little forced in these moments. "Monarchs," on the other hand, manages 
with astonishing success to use a swarm of butterflies as an emblem of 
happiness. Another, wickedly funny, tells of Edgar, whose girlfriend has walked 
out, leaving all her things behind, and of the trendy museum curator who 
persuades him to turn their house and mingled possessions into a "Museum of the 
Love Affair." 
</P>
<P>
There will be a "Before Each Other Room" containing his stuff, then a group of 
rooms with the things they use together. In the last room, Edgar will sit in a 
rocking chair, clutching her negligee. Not only can he make a living at it, the 
curator explains, but it will be therapeutic for him. 
</P>
<P>
"Inn Essence," the initial story, is a lovely Lombreglian extravaganza. The 
narrator is the sensible but anemic still-center of a comically instructive 
whirlwind. He is the salad chef at a country restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The place features a brilliant but insane pastry chef and five Thai students 
whom the owner, an enthusiast of Eastern culture, has hired as waiters. It also 
features the owner's long-suffering mistress, Ethel, whom he never quite 
marries. 
</P>
<P>
Victor, the pastry chef, attempts to stab one of the Thai students; they clamor 
for justice. The owner's version of justice is to reward everybody. He proposes 
to give both sides enormous raises. "Money is love," he explains. It is no use. 
Victor denounces the Thais to the authorities, and two immigration inspectors 
arrive. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, Ethel rouses from her gloom and brings about an extravagant 
salvation. When the inspectors get there, the waiters have disappeared and so 
has Victor. The narrator finds them all in the pastry cooler. Victor is tied 
up; Ethel and the Thais are bombarding him with cream puffs and stuffing his 
mouth with pastry cream. 
</P>
<P>
"Five young men from a distant land are looking at me with questioning eyes, 
the sweet pastries of revenge in their hands," the narrator says. "They're 
waiting for me to confirm that whatever we are doing is indeed the way justice 
is done in my country." 
</P>
<P>
It is the last of many deflections in a story as light and flaky as one of the 
pastries, built upon a lacework of misunderstandings and ricochets, and lifting 
off with the buoyancy of the Goodyear blimp.

ERMA BOMBECK: NEW WAY TO ARRANGE MARRIAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I signed a contract with a house painter the other day. It stipulated when he 
would start the job and what services he would provide. If either of us became 
dissatisfied with the arrangement, we would dissolve the relationship and I 
would pay him for his time and efforts. 
</P>
<P>
If we had sealed the bargain with a kiss in the presence of a minister, a 
three-piece orchestra and 50 pounds of shrimp cocktail, it would have 
constituted a prenuptial agreement. 
</P>
<P>
I've always had a strange feeling about dividing the assets of a marriage 
before the vows are spoken. It's a lot like lining up the paramedics at the 
bottom of a ski slope before you get on the chair lift. Not only does it set 
you up for failure, but it has all the romance of having a parking ticket 
validated. 
</P>
<P>
What it really comes down to is insecurity on the part of the richer of the 
two, who isn't sure whether a mate loves him or her for him- or herself or for 
an accompanying portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
Most of us come from simpler times where we married younger and didn't have a 
pot to cook in. All we had was potential, and that wouldn't have paid for Arnie 
Becker's tie on "L.A. Law." 
</P>
<P>
We tend to divvy things up in this country at funerals and divorces (which may 
be redundant). Like scavengers, we pick through the remains of a relationship 
that we feel should be bequeathed to us. We fight over boats and photo albums, 
children and sports cars that may or may not have some meaning to us. Sometimes 
it evolves into a war where the one who ends up with the most in the treasure 
storehouse . . . wins. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder if anyone "wins" in a divorce. How do you divide the struggle that a 
marriage takes to keep it afloat when things are tough? How do you parcel out 
the pain, or does one get all of it? Is there any love left from the good times 
to divide equally, or did the lawyers take it all? And the dignity that should 
be yours to keep, even in a divorce. Who got that? The press and the tabloids? 
And what are riches? Are they just 727s, stock holdings, casinos and hotels? 
</P>
<P>
Since there is so much divorce in this country, we tend to glamorize it by 
turning it into a board game. It's a question of how much your investment in a 
marriage is going to pay off. There is a price on everything. 
</P>
<P>
Marriage, at best, is a crap shoot. We never know who's going to change, fool 
around, turn mean or cheap, become weird, withdraw or turn into a bore. But if 
you try to anticipate all these pitfalls by putting a price tag on affection 
and trust, you don't have a marriage. You have a business arrangement.

YOUR STAMPS: FOREIGN COLLECTORS ARE KEEN FOR MINT ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY KRAUSE, Krause, a free-lance writer and a member of several national 
stamp-collecting organizations 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: We are not stamp collectors, but a friend in the Soviet Union is. He 
requested some colorful U.S. stamps to add to his collection. I told my wife to 
go to the post office and buy a few representative issues and suggested that 
she send them on in uncancelled mint condition. But a friend told me that 
stamps are of little value when sent that way (in an envelope, mint). Can you 
straighten us out? -- M.S. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Mint stamps are probably preferred by your Soviet friend. While many 
collectors like to study cancellations and other postal markings, most 
collectors in foreign countries would prefer to receive unblemished mint stamps 
because these show the full stamp design. They also tend to retain their market 
value better than used versions. 
</P>
<P>
For a couple of years I traded stamps with a gentleman in the Ukraine. We sent 
each other mint regulars and commemoratives of our respective countries; we 
also swapped information about our lives. I had no problem then getting mail 
out of the Soviet Union, although I lost a few letters going there, presumably 
to government censors or other curious officials. With Mikhail Gorbachev in 
power, I think that you will have even less trouble getting collectible stamps 
to your Soviet philatelist. 
</P>
<P>
Stamp collecting, by the way, is extremely popular in the Soviet Union, and 
collectors there have difficulty obtaining some foreign issues. So whether you 
send them new or old mint U.S. stamps, they are certain to appreciate them. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My envelope was delivered "by Overland Mail via St. Joseph, Missouri," 
according to a handwritten notation on it, then was delivered to a family 
member in Brooklyn, Alameda County, Calif. There is no year in the postmark, 
which is from St. Joseph, Mich. (there was a St. Joseph in both states). The 
stamp, which was slightly damaged on the right side (part of the perforation 
cut off), appears to be Scott No. 57 or 58 (circa 1860). Regrettably the stamp 
was cut off of this envelope and then pasted back on years ago, when I was a 
very inexperienced collector (11 years old). 
</P>
<P>
My questions are: (1) Does this represent a memento of mail delivered by Pony 
Express, and (2) if so, would it have any value to others? -- L.S. 
</P>
<P>
A: It doesn't sound like a Pony Express cover of 1860-61 (the years of its 
operation) because it doesn't show evidence of having a Pony Express stamp from 
Wells, Fargo affixed to it, or the hand stamp or manuscript writing of 
something like "Per Pony Express" or "The Central Overland California &amp; 
Pikes Peak Express Company," which so many genuine Pony Express covers have on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Scott U.S. Nos. 57 and 58 are rare special printings and are unknown on Pony 
Express covers, so maybe you really mean some other catalogue number for the 
stamp, such as 25 or 26 (the 3-cent perforated issues of 1857, in use through 
midsummer of 1861). So to summarize, you probably don't have a rare Pony 
Express cover, but let a stamp dealer look at it anyway for an evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
Q: A number of years ago I purchased from the post office a roll of 13-cent 
Liberty Bell stamps, Scott No. 1595, which was misperforated down the center of 
the bells. I have a roll of 100 stamps in the original package. What are these 
stamps worth? -- J.W. 
</P>
<P>
A: Maybe a dollar or two per pair. They are certainly worth more than face 
value, but not as much as totally imperforate (without any perforation holes) 
copies would be. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stamp News 
</P>
<P>
"Linn's World Stamp Almanac" in its long-awaited fifth edition has recently 
been released by the publisher of the largest-circulation philatelic newspaper 
in the United States: Linn's Stamp News, P.O. Box 29, Sidney, Ohio 45365. First 
published in 1977, this useful almanac had its fourth edition in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The new edition contains 994 pages of useful stamp facts, figures and 
addresses, and the soft-cover copy is available at $19.95 postpaid from Linn's, 
or from many local stamp shops. 
</P>
<P>
Included are a history of the U.S. Postal Service, U.S. postal regulations, 
first-day covers, the addresses of worldwide postal agencies, collector 
societies, dealer organizations, tips on collecting, and sources of stamp 
information. An up-to-date listing of local, national and foreign stamp clubs, 
and a summary of available computer inventory programs for stamp collections 
are major parts of this book. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding this new fifth edition of the Stamp Almanac, editor-publisher Michael 
Laurence of Linn's says that "vast amounts of new material -- most of it 
specifically related to stamps, especially U.S. stamps -- have been added. All 
the remaining text has been screened, corrected, revised and updated."

YOUR COINS: IT PAYS TO STUDY YOUR INHERITANCE

Question: I inherited a large coin collection along with some dollar bills 
about five years ago. The collection involves probably 30,000 coins including 
some junk silver, a lot of rolls of uncirculated pennies from the '60s and many 
fairly rare pieces, including American and foreign gold and silver dollars. The 
collection is much too large and valuable to just load up and take to a dealer 
for evaluation. I am wondering how one would go about liquidating such a 
collection. It is located in a small community in the Midwest. Frankly, I am 
worried about getting ripped off, as I have no idea who can be trusted. -- T.B. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The first rule in a situation such as yours is: Trust no one. The 
second rule is: Learn as much about coins and coin pricing as you can. Simply 
stated, coins are priced on the basis of rarity and condition. Rarity is 
determined by the date, mint mark and denomination of a coin. Condition is 
determined subjectively, with experts often finding themselves in honest 
disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, your hoard has some value. To determine a fair market price, you 
should separate the gold from the silver and then sort the coins by 
denomination and date. Prepare an inventory. Do the same with the bills and the 
foreign pieces, separating them by country. After you have a pretty good idea 
of what you own, use some standard pricing guides to get a very rough idea as 
to what they might be worth. 
</P>
<P>
Then, check with some dealers. You might want to show them a sampling of your 
coins. Dealers will travel anywhere if they think it's worthwhile. Have an idea 
as to what you want for your coins and be prepared to sell if the dealer comes 
close to your estimate. 
</P>
<P>
One of the coins could well be worth more than the rest of the 30,000 in your 
collection. But there's only one way to find out. If you do your homework, 
you'll be able to trust your better judgment.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO : BARITONE SAX IS IN GOOD HANDS WITH 
NICK BRIGNOLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though difficult to master, the baritone sax can produce amazing sounds in the 
right hands. Unfortunately, few jazz players have chosen to make it their 
instrument of choice. 
</P>
<P>
Baritone sax player Nick Brignola's appearance this Saturday at 8 p.m. at the 
San Diego Convention Center is a rare opportunity to hear what this horn can 
do. 
</P>
<P>
The concert is the second in the three-part "Salute to the Masters" series 
being presented by the San Diego Jazz Society. Brignola's show will be a 
tribute to jazz saxophonist Charlie "Bird" Parker, generally considered one of 
the half a dozen most important jazz artists of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Brignola began his musical education as a schoolboy clarinetist, and switched 
to alto sax as he began to get serious about jazz. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I found the baritone and that was it," Brignola said. "I was able to 
express my personality more." 
</P>
<P>
"Bird" was known for the lightning be-bop lines he invented on alto, and one 
might expect that Brignola would have a tough time rekindling Parker's memory 
on the larger, more air-consuming baritone. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter what instrument I pick up, it translates the music inside me," 
Brignola said. "The instrument is just a vehicle. I feel I can play different 
horns with equal facility, but I've worked hard at it. I may be one of few who 
can do it. It's hard, rather like a trumpet player picking up a tuba." 
</P>
<P>
Brignola, who names baritone sax predecessors Harry Carney and Pepper Adams as 
influences, has long been a favorite of jazz purists. A New York Times writer 
last year referred to his "full, hard-bottomed sound and . . . urgent, 
swaggering attack." In various jazz polls, he's consistently named by critics, 
fans and peers as the top baritone player. 
</P>
<P>
During the '50s, Brignola leaned toward the West Coast cool-jazz sound being 
pioneered by players such as Paul Desmond, Stan Getz and Bud Shank. "It was 
easy to learn -- palatable music," he said. But when he sought something more 
challenging, he became a be-bop convert, with Parker as his main guru. (Parker 
died when Brignola was still a teen-ager, and the two never met.) 
</P>
<P>
"On a Different Level," Brignola's new recording, should be in stores any day. 
It pits Brignola with drummer Jack DeJohnette, pianist Kenny Barron and bassist 
Dave Holland. 
</P>
<P>
"The improvisations were going to be very esoteric, so we decided to use 
standards so listeners could hang their hats on it," he said. "There's music by 
Ornette Coleman, Charles Mingus, Jerome Kern, Duke Ellington, Tadd Dameron. It 
was designed to let me do my thing like I do on the job. Some cuts are a little 
longer than normal air play time." 
</P>
<P>
The lack of great commercial success doesn't bother Brignola, who said he is 
lucky to sell 15,000 or 20,000 copies of his recordings. "Pure jazz was never 
meant to appeal to the masses. Anybody selling over 40,000 records would be 
suspect." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, Brignola, who plans to bring both soprano and baritone saxes, 
will be supported by pianist Frank Strazzeri -- whose meandering improvisations 
sometimes call to mind Thelonious Monk -- plus trumpeter Jimmy Noone, drummer 
Tootie Heath and bassist John Leitham. The material will lean heavily on 
Parker's own compositions and his versions of popular jazz standards. 
</P>
<P>
The new album by San Diego's own Checkfield, "A View from the Bridge," is the 
strongest yet from the duo of Ron Satterfield and John Archer. The pair, both 
experts with mixing boards, synthesizers, guitars, vocals and keyboards, 
brought in top players, including San Diegans Peter Sprague, John Rekevics, 
Mark Hunter, John Leftwich and Duncan Moore, plus out-of-towners such as 
guitarist Pat Kelley, flutist Steve Kujala and violinist Darol Anger. Where 
earlier albums from Checkfield were technically polished but lacking in punch, 
the new project is more dynamic. 
</P>
<P>
Out of 11 songs, all composed by Checkfield, "Conjuring" stands out, with its 
African and tropical rhythms providing the backbeat for Kujala's soothing 
flute. Anger's soaring violin lines are impressive on several cuts. The album 
includes more singing than past Checkfield efforts. Archer and Satterfield have 
serviceable voices, but their lyrics sometimes get too singsong and cute. The 
album is due to be in stores next week. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego flutist Lori Bell and her musical soul mate, L.A. pianist Dave 
Mackay, play Words &amp; Music Bookstore in Hillcrest Friday and Saturday 
nights, and the Salmon House restaurant on Mission Bay on Sunday night. They'll 
work as a duo Friday and Saturday and be joined by drummer Barry Farrar and 
bassist Bill Andrews on Sunday. Bell and Mackay are shopping around a demo tape 
that includes five new songs in the more commercial, light-jazz direction they 
began with the song "The Goose Is Loose" from their last album, "Take Me to 
Brazil." At Words &amp; Music, their repertoire will include several originals, 
plus music by George Gershwin, Michel Legrand and Charlie Parker. Bell's song 
"Waltz for Joe," written for San Diego pianist Joe Azarello, is included on a 
new Japanese release from local pianist Mike Wofford titled "All Alone." 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: Open Channel, the new electric-jazz band fronted by San Diego guitarist 
Jim Storey and including top local saxophonist Steve Feierabend, plays the Del 
Mar Hilton this Friday and Saturday nights and again next weekend. Vocalist 
Cath Eckert will perform with the band and may join it permanently if the 
chemistry is right. . . . Sunday night from 7 to 8, the Claude Bolling Big Band 
is featured on "Le Jazz Club," the French program imported to KSDS-FM (88.3). . 
. . Jazz artists such as local pianist Glenn Horiuchi have incorporated 
authentic Oriental influences into their music. Friday night at 8, the real 
thing can be heard at UC San Diego's Price Center Theatre, as Silk and Lace, 
the orchestra of the Chinese Music Society of North America, performs several 
classical and modern Chinese works.

New Job for Sellars: L.A. Festival Artistic Director Peter Sellars on March 23 
will be named artistic adviser for the newly formed Boston Opera Theater, which 
is tentatively scheduled to open in 1990 with Sellars' revivals "Don Giovanni," 
"Marriage of Figaro" and "Cosi fan Tutte." The revivals will run through 
spring, 1991. In 1993 the new company will mount a six-month season, in which 
Sellars will stage a new production each year. L.A. Festival Executive Director 
Judith Luther said Sellars' new position shouldn't affect his duties with the 
L.A. Festival and in fact "should enhance . . . his abilities to fund-raise . . 
. (through) contacts with people back East." SHAUNA SNOW

Einstein Footage Found: Nearly 4,000 feet of rare film on Albert Einstein that 
was reported missing after it fell out of a Federal Express delivery truck more 
than a week ago was returned to the University of South Carolina Wednesday. The 
films and other missing packages were returned by a Columbia, S.C., bail 
bondsman who apparently was given the parcels by a man who picked them up 
shortly after they fell off the truck. 
</P>
<P>
The films had been on their way from their home at the university to be copied 
for a French film maker. A university spokesman said Federal Express will get 
another chance to transport the films, which have historical value to 
researchers and historians, to their New Jersey destination. SHAUNA SNOW

POP BEAT: 3D PICNIC SERVES HOT TUNES, LYRICS ON DEBUT ALBUM; 
</P>
<P>
ROCK: "DIRT," AN LP THAT IS BOTH ARTFUL AND WITTY, IS TOPS AMONG A SAMPLING OF 
ORANGE COUNTY RELEASES. 
</P>

Already, 1990 looks like a rare vintage year for the Orange County rock scene, 
at least as far as recordings go. January and February brought us a fine heavy 
metal album by former Black Sabbath drummer Bill Ward, an exceptional country 
effort from Chris Gaffney &amp; the Cold Hard Facts, and intelligent, 
formula-resistant hard rock from Tender Fury. 
</P>
<P>
Awaiting release are Vinnie James' head-turning debut album, "All American 
Boy," T.S.O.L.'s impressive "Strange Love," a strong debut album from Burning 
Tree, and Social Distortion's much-anticipated major-label arrival for Epic, 
due out at the end of this month (KROQ is already playing one new S.D. track, 
"Let It Be Me," which sounded like a great sonic boom when it came over my car 
radio the other day). 
</P>
<P>
The crop of local albums up for review in this week's Pop Beat includes one 
that will add considerably to the year's luster, and several others that at 
least will lend some depth. The rating scale is * (poor) to ****** (a classic). 
</P>
<P>
3D PICNIC 
</P>
<P>
"Dirt." (Earth Music/Cargo Records) 
</P>
<P>
**** 
</P>
<P>
In pop music, stealing is only immoral if you do it without wit and style. With 
3D Picnic, a Los Angeles band that sprang from Orange County roots and has 
continued to circulate in the local scene's club orbit, kleptomania is a 
thoroughly artful, completely engaging dodge. Led by main singer and songwriter 
Don Burnet, 3D Picnic keeps an old tradition alive by picking precursors' 
pockets of musical currency that had been stolen, in its turn, from a previous 
pop generation. 
</P>
<P>
There's Burnet-doing-Bowie-doing-Lennon on "Charles Thinks About It." And 
Burnet and co-vocalist Carolynne Edwards recreating E.L.O. co-founder Roy 
Wood's recreation of the Everly Brothers on "She's Over Me." And too many 
wonderful thefts of Badfinger thieving from the Beatles to even mention (well, 
we'll mention the gloriously ebullient "Baby Blue," which even swipes the title 
of one of Badfinger's best songs). 
</P>
<P>
There is more going on here than mere clever quotation. Burnet's guitars throb 
with a grainy, gritty immediacy, dispelling any notion of prissy '60s 
preservationism. The production and song arrangements, full of smartly applied 
layers of keyboards and harmony vocals, multiple guitars and occasional studio 
effects, are rich and full without ever being overblown. The lyrics are alive 
with wit and verbal energy, even on songs about laying inert in bed under the 
weight of severe depression. Counterbalancing those serious numbers are bits of 
sheer whimsy, both lyrical and sonic. Serving up everything from power pop to 
folk rock and joking hillbilly music in the course of 14 songs (18 on CD), 3D 
Picnic is nothing if not multidimensional. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, this is a band that rock critics are going to savor like a good game 
of chess. But for the average music fan who doesn't want to turn listening into 
a mental game, "Dirt" offers the simplest pleasure of all -- it's endlessly 
hummable, a picnic of a debut album. The album's release date is March 21. 3D 
Picnic will appear March 28 at Club Tangent at the Marquee in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
MIND OVER 4 
</P>
<P>
"Mind Over 4." (Destiny) 
</P>
<P>
** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
"The Goddess." (Massive Sound) 
</P>
<P>
** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
This band could be a metal phenomenon in the making. "Mind Over 4," released 
late last year, and "The Goddess," due out later this month, are two snapshots 
of a band of ambitious artistic reach honing its craft in a way that -- if it 
continues -- could lead to something special. The basic ingredients for 
excellence are evident on both albums. The bass-drums-guitar instrumental unit 
hits with a tough, crunching impact that can recall Metallica in full flight, 
but it is also capable of softer, atmospheric passages akin to early King 
Crimson. The fourth member, singer Spike Xavier, has a rangy, 
strong-as-a-bellows voice. Xavier loves the operatic heavy metal vocal style 
that is usually such a bombastic bore, but he manages to invest it with real 
feeling in songs full of dire existential fear. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Metallica, which is unremittingly baleful in its vision of the human 
enterprise, Mind Over 4 sets up a dialogue in which the possibility of 
salvation for the individual and for society is at least entertained before we 
plunge back into the dark maelstrom. 
</P>
<P>
What's needed now is a good, strong dose of melodicism to give Mind Over 4's 
attack more staying power in the mind, a bit more earthy detail and narrative 
to flesh out the band's symbolic lyrics, and a tightening of its sometimes 
wandering song structures (do we dare also ask for a sense of humor?). "The 
Goddess," the stronger of these two releases, shows progress on all these 
fronts -- except, of course, the humor. For speed metal fans, both of these 
records are worth seeking out. 
</P>
<P>
DON'T MEAN MAYBE 
</P>
<P>
"Live Sample." (Dr. Dream) 
</P>
<P>
** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
Like Mind Over 4, Don't Mean Maybe is gradually broadening its scope and 
refining its approach in a way that holds lots of promise. The band's 
self-produced 1989 mini-album drew primarily on one good alternative-rock 
source, the Minutemen. This debut LP adds another smart influence, the Meat 
Puppets, to the trio's arsenal. But "Live Sample" doesn't quite reach beyond 
its influences, and the songwriting isn't consistently strong enough to sustain 
a full-length album. Boiled down to its best material, "Live Sample" would have 
yielded another very good EP. 
</P>
<P>
Sparsely produced, with a clean, live sound and few overdubs, the album 
provides a good showcase for Don't Mean Maybe's twisting, wiry approach. Mark 
Andrea's forceful, riff-happy guitar playing draws on psychedelia without 
getting tiresomely prolific. Jeff Fairbanks, like all good rock-trio drummers, 
can turn percussion into a lead instrument. It would have been better, though, 
if Don't Mean Maybe had used the resources of the studio to experiment with 
adding extra dimensions to its sound. 
</P>
<P>
"Jacket" is indicative of the album's overall lack of daring. The song lifts 
its melody from the Minutemen's profound anti-war statement, "The Price of 
Paradise." But unlike 3D Picnic, Don't Mean Maybe doesn't steal well. Aside 
from a fine guitar solo, the song is a prosaic account of a petty car burglary. 
Why borrow so obviously from a noble precursor and use it for such mundane 
ends? 
</P>
<P>
Don't Mean Maybe's best numbers are humorous sallies about earthy subjects -- 
like "Colt 45," with its country stomp beat, the enjoyably poppy "Happy Beans," 
with its vocal harmonies patterned after the Meat Puppets, and the sardonic 
rant of "Buff 'n' Tan," in which Andrea launches some funny invective at the 
trendy beach set. 
</P>
<P>
In all, a maybe. 
</P>
<P>
HOLLYWOOD JONESES 
</P>
<P>
"Champagne." (Trigon) 
</P>
<P>
*** 
</P>
<P>
In truth, "Champagne" isn't the full title of this six-song mini-album. We've 
expurgated it to protect the innocent from the HoJos' coarse sense of humor. 
We've also omitted a reproduction of the album cover, which is hilarious, but 
in awful taste. We've even changed the band name that appears on that album 
cover -- but that's simply because the erstwhile just-plain-Joneses added 
"Hollywood" to their name after the initial printing to avoid a legal battle 
with a similarly named Boston band. 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that bandleader Jeff Drake has self-censored his own worst 
sexist tendencies, which came out in torrents of deplorable epithets toward 
women on the 1986 album, "Keeping Up With the Joneses." 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood Joneses' approach is patterned mostly after the New York Dolls -- 
loud, loose, lubricated takes on Rolling Stones-style guitar rock in which the 
band skids and slides and hits with a good, raw kick -- and if it crashes 
against the guard rails, so much the better. 
</P>
<P>
Drake sings in a bratty sneer that is just right alongside the headlong lurch 
of inebriated guitars. Greg Kuehn's piano pounding, straight out of the British 
school of Ians (Stewart and MacLagan), is a consistent highlight. Solid 
original songs set the stage for ragged-but-right versions of "Your Cheatin' 
Heart" and "Route 66," wherein the philosophy was for everyone involved to 
blast off at the start, and may the best man reach the finish line first. And 
that's pretty much the way this reprobate brand of rock ought to be played. 
It's nothing new, but it's tasty -- especially in a small, EP-size bite like 
this. 
</P>
<P>
D.I. 
</P>
<P>
"Tragedy Again." (Triple X) 
</P>
<P>
* 1/2 
</P>
<P>
In its long, erratic career, D.I. has shown at times that good, rewarding rock 
can be forged from the caldron of hard-core punk. Songs like "Johnny's Got a 
Problem," "Richard Hung Himself," "Hang Ten in East Berlin" and the immortal 
"OC Life" all had strong melodic hooks, searing instrumental focus and an 
interesting point to make. 
</P>
<P>
For at least half of "Tragedy Again," bandleader Casey Royer and crew merely go 
through hard-and-fast motions. The music subsides into undifferentiated thrash, 
the lyrics drown in the sexism of "Love to Me Is Sin" or the rote 
youth-rebellion sloganeering of "Manhole." 
</P>
<P>
The better tracks include the title song, the by-now obligatory anti-heroin 
number, "Chiva," and "On Our Way," a pop-flavored but emotionally bloodless 
tune about leaving a sweetheart to go on tour (far from sweet sorrow, Royer 
makes parting sound like a perfunctory formality to be gotten through before he 
can run off and have some real fun). But even these are pallid compared to 
D.I.'s top form of old. A band can only play a style as limiting as hard-core 
for so long before terminal monotony sets in. 
</P>
<P>
"Tragedy Again" may appeal to throwback fans willing to remain stuck in the 
early '80s, when there was still some novelty and excitement in playing it 
hard-and-fast.

FREDERICA VON STADE MAKES A HAPPY AMBASSADOR DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In local appearances going back a decade and a half, Frederica von Stade has 
graced -- here, the verb is appropriate -- several local stages, including, of 
course, the all-important operatic ones. But only on Tuesday night did the 
celebrated American mezzo-soprano finally sing at Ambassador Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Stade's public, a loyal group of fans, followed her to Pasadena for the 
occasion of her first area recital in more than four years; as a result, the 
elegant hall hosted a healthy crowd, which overflowed into the orchestra pit. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion was a happy one, which could be no surprise to those fans. Though 
not in optimal voice -- some tell-tale coughs at her stage-exits and a few 
unfocused top notes attested to a recent reported flu and head cold -- Stade 
nevertheless sang with her customary artistry, panache, musicality and 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
In short, she was irresistible. Again. 
</P>
<P>
With the brilliant but cannily understated assistance of Martin Katz -- for 
this generation of American singers, the Rolls-Royce of pianistic partners -- 
Stade gave a touching, involving and expert performance. 
</P>
<P>
Her musical agenda, in which she traversed four languages and seven styles as 
easily as she conquered complicated passagework and problems of enunciation, 
was a model of sensible sophistication. It mixed the familiar with the 
esoteric, committed no cliches, and offered balanced delights without 
banalities. 
</P>
<P>
Vocally, the most satisfying display came in arias by Mozart -- the pairing of 
the recitative, "Giunse alfin il momento," from "Nozze di Figaro," followed 
immediately by the optional "Figaro" aria, "Al desio di chi ch'adora" -- and 
Rossini. Rosina's "Una voce poco fa" was sung handsomely and with nuance, but 
no mannerisms. 
</P>
<P>
Emotionally, the high points came first in a 20th-Century Italian grouping at 
the beginning of the evening -- Puccini's "E l'uccellino," Respighi's "E se un 
giorno tornasse . . ." and Pizzetti's "I Pastori," stood out in particular. In 
a Schubert group, "Die Liebe hat gelogen" chilled, as it ought, and "Der 
Musensohn" spread joy. 
</P>
<P>
Pointed wryness characterized Stade's singing of melodies by Honegger and 
Satie, and the deeper resonances beneath the surface humor of both Copland's 
"Why do they shut me out of heaven" and Rorem's "I Am Rose" were delivered, 
along with the laughs. A closing group of arrangements by Joseph Canteloube, 
called "Chants de France," roused the audience to cheers. DANIEL CARIAGA

NEIL RUTMAN AT USC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA PERLMUTTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not every piano sweepstakes contender makes his way to the glittery A-circuit 
of the winners' circuit -- some, like Neil Rutman, do nicely at a sub-stratum. 
</P>
<P>
At his recital Monday night in Hancock Auditorium at USC, the San Francisco 
native demonstrated the partial right stuff for either track: a powerful 
technique and the concentration for delivering whiz-bang accounts of big 
showpieces. 
</P>
<P>
Honoring Donald Crockett of the USC School of Music faculty, Rutman played that 
composer's "Pilgrimage," a lively piece animated by staccato chords warring 
with dense passagework, percussion with silence. The pianist did much to ensure 
its identity as a mildly frantic but nonetheless agreeable soundscape. 
</P>
<P>
He also nodded to the USC "Copland at 90" Festival, playing "Night Thoughts," a 
study the venerable composer wrote for the 1973 Van Cliburn Competition. Somber 
yet quirky, it has a characteristic spareness that proved a tonic for the 
contestant at hand. 
</P>
<P>
Less persuasive was his way with an opening group by Jean-Phillipe Rameau. Here 
he created a swath of sound, rather than note-by-note clarity, pedaling heavily 
on an instrument already unsuited to Baroque niceties. 
</P>
<P>
Giving full vent to this tendency in the following B-minor Sonata of Liszt, 
Rutman mercilessly pounded what was now a tubby, clangorous piano to a nearly 
painful din. But he drove the score's melodramatic points home and lavished his 
tender all on the dreamy passages, though without much sensuality. 
</P>
<P>
Matters improved with Clara Schumann's Variations on a Theme by Robert 
Schumann, which favored controlled, rather than poetic, introspection and pro 
forma, rather than wild, exuberance. 
</P>
<P>
In Ravel's "La Valse," one heard the whole gamut of Rutman's musical persona: a 
forceful, excited immersion into the physicality of the demands, but a 
self-conscious articulation that stopped him from delivering the score all of a 
piece. DONNA PERLMUTTER

'VAMPIRE LESBIANS' SOARS BEYOND THE RIDICULOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Try throwing a dinner party for two pinheads and a Cyclops," wails someone in 
Charles Busch's "Vampire Lesbians of Sodom" at the Coronet Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Try inventing ridiculous names (Enid Wetwhistle? La Condesa de Scrofula de -- 
well, never mind). Try wearing the most soigne fright wigs this side of 
Halloween (creator is Elizabeth Katherine Carr). Try constructing the most 
ridiculous costumes (John Glaser) this side of "Beach Blanket Babylon." Try 
besting the late Charles Ludlam at his own Ridiculous Theatre game. 
</P>
<P>
Busch has. And then some. Can a show called "Vampire Lesbians of Sodom" 
(preceded by a curtain-raiser titled "Sleeping Beauty or Coma") be anything but 
camp transvestism punctuated by blatantly, ostentatiously vulgar jokes? Of 
course not. The title tells you so. But Busch's and director Kenneth Elliott's 
Theatre-in-Limbo company (which is anything but) delivers on its promise. This 
is a theater of knobby knees, winks, tongues in cheeks, eye-liners and 
one-liners. 
</P>
<P>
Theater to gross out by. 
</P>
<P>
No cow is sacred, especially not Hollywood or Las Vegas. (No joke is sacred 
either. "This isn't hair on my head, these are nerve-endings," used here, first 
came out of Phyllis Diller's mouth on a verrrry early appearance on the Jack 
Paar show!) But then the plots are as outlandish as the play titles and mere 
devices for spoofing anything within shooting range. In the case of "Sleeping 
Beauty," it's haute couture; in "Vampire" it's Dracula and silent screen stars. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, though, these are characters in search of excuses for great get-ups and 
off-color jokes. "Sleeping Beauty" is a more limited effort than "Vampire 
Lesbians," but both are live-wire examples of the Ludlam/Ridiculous tradition, 
which explains "Vampire's" ongoing success Off-Broadway (it's been packing them 
in at the Provincetown Playhouse since 1985). 
</P>
<P>
Busch is the fulcrum. Prettier than Ludlam, he plays several female parts -- 
roles -- to confectionary perfection. He revels in Sarah Bernhardt-style 
asides, batting eyelashes and topping himself from one wig to the next. His 
Madeleine Astarte, silent-screen vamp, looks and acts like a case of genetic 
tampering between Lucille Ball and Marlene Dietrich. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Aulino protests too much as frantic designer Sebastian Lore in "Sleeping 
Beauty." But Andy Halliday (the prim Miss Thick in "Sleeping Beauty" and 
Etienne the butler in "Vampire") has a face made for caricature. His mouth 
looks like something that happened when the slasher missed his throat. 
</P>
<P>
It's not all up to the men, however. The real women in this cast make some of 
the strongest contributions. Monica Horan is memorable as Anthea Arlo in the 
curtain-raiser and as starlet Renee Vain in "Vampire." But it is blonde Julie 
Halston who really takes it away as "Sleeping Beauty's" flaky Enid and 
"Vampire's" slinkily-attired Succubus and growling Condesa -- an imperious 
movie queen in perpetual high dudgeon. ("I have reason to believe La Condesa is 
one of the undead" -- "No, darling, she just looks that way." Yes, it's that 
kind of humor. Low.) 
</P>
<P>
Sets and lights (B.T. Whitehill and Vivien Leone, respectively) are incidental 
to this show, which is fundamentally (accent on the first syllable) and 
deliberately all about costume, camp and coarseness. 
</P>
<P>
Not for all markets, but certainly for certain markets. Rarely has a show been 
better suited to the dingy, dark, mildly decadent ambience of the Coronet. A 
few months ago, one might have added the word decrepit too, but the management 
has spruced up the place some. 
</P>
<P>
All the more reason to expect that "Vampire Lesbians," with its guaranteed cult 
status, might run on and on, ad infinitum. 
</P>
<P>

10 p.m.; Sundays, 3 and 7:30 p.m. Indefinitely. Tickets: $18-$22; (213)

MICROWAVE: PEPPERY STEW WARMS A WINTER DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

cookbook authors specializing in microwave cookery.

<P>
Nothing warms a wintry day faster than a peppery stew from South of the Border. 
And nothing accommodates the hurried cook better than almost effortless main 
dishes, especially if they can be microwaved a day or two ahead of time then 
reheated just before serving. 
</P>
<P>
Our Picadillo and Chicken Mole, rich with the flavors of Old Mexico, fill the 
bill on both counts. Best of all, they need only a crisp green salad and a 
fresh fruit dessert to round out the meal. 
</P>
<P>
Like stews made the old-fashioned way, you'll find that both of these Mexican 
classics profit from a stay in the fridge because their exotic flavors have a 
chance to mellow and marry. 
</P>
<P>
PICADILLO (Spicy Mexican Chili) 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon oil 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Pour sauce over chicken, recover and microwave on HIGH 10 minutes. Rotate 
casserole 180 degrees and baste chicken with sauce. Reduce power to MEDIUM (50% 
power), recover and microwave 10 to 12 minutes or until chicken is tender, 
rotating casserole 180 degrees and basting chicken with sauce at half time. 
</P>
<P>
Adjust salt as needed. Thin sauce with additional chicken broth if too thick. 
Serve at once over hot cooked rice or cool to room temperature, cover and 
refrigerate until shortly before serving. To reheat, microwave covered 
casserole on MEDIUM-HIGH (70% power) 8 to 10 minutes, rearranging chicken in 
sauce and stirring at half time. Makes 4 servings.

DAMAGE TALLY STILL RISING WEEK AFTER QUAKE; 
</P>
<P>
EARTHQUAKE: POMONA, CLAREMONT AND LA VERNE OFFICIALS SAY FEW PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
DISPLACED AND FEW BUSINESSES CLOSED. BUT LOSSES APPROACH $10 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A week after a strong earthquake and hundreds of aftershocks, officials in 
Pomona, Claremont and La Verne were still adding up the damage Wednesday, 
inspecting cracks in buildings and waiting to hear from state and federal 
officials on the availability of aid. 
</P>
<P>
The 5.5-magnitude quake, centered three miles northwest of Upland in San 
Bernardino County, did much of its damage in eastern Los Angeles County. Losses 
in the three cities approach $10 million, according to the latest estimates. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still getting calls coming in," said La Verne Fire Chief Robert Miller. 
"It may be seven to 10 days before we know how many residential structures were 
damaged." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the damage to homes and businesses is minor. Few residents have been 
displaced and few businesses have been forced to close. 
</P>
<P>
But at Mt. San Antonio Gardens, a retirement complex that straddles Pomona and 
Claremont, 78 residents of a four-story building were evacuated Friday night 
and will be kept out of their apartments indefinitely while structural damage 
is repaired. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Radamaker, executive director of the 460-resident retirement center, said 
some of the displaced residents moved into other buildings in the 28-acre 
complex and some went to live with their families. But 35 residents have moved 
to Griswold's Claremont Center, a hotel about five blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
"It's inconvenient," said Emily Ronfeldt, a 75-year-old retired teacher who is 
one of those who moved to Griswold's. "But we're so lucky." 
</P>
<P>
Ronfeldt said she and her husband came through the quake unhurt. The temporary 
move to Griswold's, she said, is less traumatic than their decision a year ago 
to give up their nine-room house in Claremont and move into the retirement 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
In Claremont, 11 businesses in the two-story Harvard Square building remain 
closed because of structural damage that is being repaired. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to reopen by the weekend," said Joan Bunte, owner of the Craft Designs 
gift shop. 
</P>
<P>
Bunte, who was in her shop when the main quake struck said, "It was sort of 
like a horror movie with stuff flying around." Pottery and glassware broke, she 
said, but no one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
The experience was so unnerving, Bunte said Tuesday, that "today was basically 
the first time I could talk about this earthquake without crying. It has been 
so traumatic. I finally let my daughter go home to her apartment today. I 
thought I could be grown up and stay by myself." 
</P>
<P>
Caltech spokesman Robert Finn said there have been 400 to 500 aftershocks since 
the Feb. 28 temblor, about three dozen of them large enough to be felt. He said 
the number of aftershocks was not unusually high. Seismologists have not yet 
agreed on which fault was responsible for the quake. 
</P>
<P>
In Claremont, City Manager Glenn Southard said the city has estimated the 
damage at about $1 million. Major reported losses are $400,000 to $600,000 at 
the Claremont Colleges and $100,000 to grocery and liquor stores. About 150 
houses have damaged chimneys. 
</P>
<P>
In La Verne, Fire Chief Miller said 15 businesses have damage estimated to 
total $375,000 and about 100 residences, including some mobile homes, sustained 
damage estimated at $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
In Pomona, officials have estimated the damage at almost $7 million. Nearly 600 
buildings were damaged. By Wednesday, 25 buildings were still in such hazardous 
shape that entry was being restricted. 
</P>
<P>
California Conservation Corps crews have been working in Pomona and La Verne to 
tear down damaged chimneys at no cost to homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
The La Verne City Council this week adopted a policy of waiving building 
permits for property owners repairing quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Alexander, regional administrator of the state Office of Emergency 
Services, said that whether property owners will be able to apply for low-cost 
loans to repair damage hasn't been decided.

CULVER CITY COUNCIL OKS PLANS TO BUILD MARINA PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELDON ITO, COMMUNITY CORRESPONDENT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The developers appeared more confident, their opponents more battle-weary than 
in hearings past, but in the end the result was the same: The proposed Marina 
Place mall emerged virtually unscathed, and significantly closer to the start 
of construction. 
</P>
<P>
After five hours of public hearing and discussion on Monday night, the Culver 
City Council voted 3 to 2 to approve the plans and environmental report for the 
1-million-square-foot, Mediterranean-style mall that promises to heap traffic, 
noise and pollution on its Los Angeles neighbors and much-needed revenue on 
Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Steven Gourley and Jim Boulgarides opposed the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The council also agreed to meet on March 19 with the Planning Commission and 
the developers -- Prudential Insurance Co. and Melvin Simon Associates -- to 
hammer out a development agreement that would prevent a future council from 
rescinding the approval. 
</P>
<P>
If an agreement is reached and a settlement achieved in the pending lawsuit 
brought by the Venice Town Council and the city of Los Angeles, ground could be 
broken for the mall by this summer, according to Michael L. Marr, vice 
president of development for Melvin Simon. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very pleased and grateful that the city agreed not only with the 
concept, but also with the specifics of the project," Marr said after the 
hearing. "We're looking forward to moving ahead with construction." 
</P>
<P>
Because of its location at the tip of a thin, two-mile-long finger of Culver 
City that juts west along Washington Boulevard, the proposed mall site near the 
corner of Lincoln Boulevard is surrounded on three sides by Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles residents have complained that they would bear the burdens of the 
mall while receiving almost no benefit. Culver City residents countered that 
the project would only do to Los Angeles what Los Angeles has been doing to 
their city for years. 
</P>
<P>
About 250 people showed up for Monday's hearing in Veterans Auditorium. The 
approximately 60 speakers at the hearing were fairly evenly split for and 
against the project. 
</P>
<P>
"I find it ironic that it's a project in Culver City that provokes such 
passion, while Culver City is overwhelmed by development in Los Angeles and 
nothing is done," said Culver City resident Andrew Weismann. 
</P>
<P>
Weismann contended, for example, that Los Angeles had failed to carry out an 
agreement made more than a decade ago to widen Overland Avenue, a congested 
artery connecting Culver City with Westwood and the Santa Monica (10) Freeway. 
Now, he said, Los Angeles is compounding the problem by allowing new apartment 
complexes near the worst bottleneck, a two-lane stretch of Overland between 
Venice and Palms boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
But Karl Manheim, one of a few Culver City residents to speak against the mall, 
said: "I think it's a short-sighted vision on the part of Culver City to 
capture all the goodies for itself while putting all the burden on someone 
else. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're trying to seek revenge against Los Angeles, we're not going to 
prevail," he added. "Los Angeles has too many tools at its disposal." 
</P>
<P>
Marina Place would include Bullock's and Nordstrom stores as anchors, 150 other 
stores and a six-screen movie theater. It is expected to significantly 
aggravate traffic congestion over a broad area of the Westside, according to 
the environmental report on the project. Other adverse environmental impacts, 
the report said, would include the noise generated by large delivery trucks, 
which will be allowed on nearby residential streets as early as 6 a.m., and 
poorer air quality because of the increased traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The California Environmental Quality Act requires developers to identify and 
offset all significant environmental impacts associated with a large project. 
But it also allows a city to find an "overriding consideration," such as the 
economic benefit of a project, and allow it to be built even if the impacts are 
not mitigated. 
</P>
<P>
Culver City is expected to reap more than $12 million in various developer 
concessions during the first year from Marina Place and net $2.5 million a year 
in sales taxes and business license fees thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Los Angeles residents who attended Monday's hearing sounded more 
conciliatory and less combative than they have at past hearings. Some of them 
almost ignored Marina Place, as if it were a foregone conclusion, and instead 
asked the council to look ahead and join them in fighting to scale back Playa 
Vista and other projects in the area and to accept Los Angeles Mayor Tom 
Bradley's invitation to discuss cooperative planning. 
</P>
<P>
"The border war must end, we can't go on doing our regional planning this way," 
said attorney Debra Bowen, who is representing the Venice Town Council in its 
lawsuit against Culver City. "We've seen amazing things happen this year all 
over the world -- let them happen between Culver City and Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
It did not happen Monday night. When the public testimony was over, Councilman 
Boulgarides proposed that the developers reduce the mall's size by 20%, limit 
it to 56 feet in height, and eliminate the proposed movie theater. His motion 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Paul Jacobs, Richard Alexander and Jozelle Smith acknowledged 
the problems the mall would cause but voted in favor of the project, citing the 
developer's cooperation, the lack of cooperation in the past from Los Angeles, 
and Culver City's need for revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Boulgarides voted against the mall, as did Gourley, who called the idea of 
Marina Place as Culver City's revenge on Los Angeles "repugnant." 
</P>
<P>
Gourley said that it was not Culver City's fault that the Venice-Marina del Rey 
area was overburdened with traffic and pollution, but added, "I'm not willing 
to drive another nail into this coffin just because Los Angeles has already 
driven so many into it." 
</P>
<P>
Bowen said she will continue to try to stop the mall in court on technical 
grounds concerning the project's environmental report and the city's failure to 
analyze the mall's impact under state coastal laws.

JUDGES COURT PUBLIC AT WESTWOOD FORUM; 
</P>
<P>
JUDICIARY: SOME OF THE 30 JURISTS URGED PRESSURE ON THE LEGISLATURE TO CHANGE 
UNPOPULAR LAWS THAT GUIDE THE BENCH'S RULINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of 30 local judges shucked their robes and gavels, but maintained their 
judicial restraint Tuesday night as they fielded questions from the public 
about what they do and why they do it. 
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented event, one of 70 public forums scheduled around the state 
during "Meet Your Judges Week," drew about 275 members of the public to 
Wadsworth Theater in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
Topics of the questions varied from grandparents' visitation rights to why 
criminals are paroled before serving their full terms in prison. The answer to 
the second question -- that prisoners are released early under a state law 
passed by the Legislature and that trial judges have nothing to do with it -- 
was one of their key messages of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Going to the podium to answer specific questions, judge after judge said in one 
way or another that they don't have as much power or leeway as the public seems 
to think, because the Legislature makes the laws and higher courts interpret 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't like the system, you have to change it through the state 
Legislature," said the panel moderator, "People's Court" Judge Joseph Wapner. 
"Judges can't do it." 
</P>
<P>
The judges also urged the public not to judge the system by what they see in 
the media, either in fictionalized dramas or news reporting on unusual cases 
that make headlines. 
</P>
<P>
"The newspapers are not going to tell you about the everyday cases," said 
Superior Court Judge Jacqueline Connor. "You're seeing the extremes." 
</P>
<P>
At the Westwood forum, 18 Los Angeles County Superior Court judges and one 
commissioner were joined on the stage by Municipal Court judges (including 
Wapner's son, Fred, newly appointed to the bench) and commissioners from Los 
Angeles, Beverly Hills, Santa Monica and Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
Their stated mission for the evening was to "demystify" the judicial process 
for citizens. Superior Court Judge David Perez noted that judges, isolated by 
their canons of ethics and constrained by law from commenting on pending cases, 
are virtually required by the judicial system to be remote, almost anonymous 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, according to one poll, Wapner, who had a distinguished career on the 
Superior Court bench before becoming a television star, is better known to the 
public than U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist. 
</P>
<P>
The barriers between the judiciary and the public are basically impenetrable, 
Superior Court Judge Sara Radin said when asked, "How can people with no money 
get in to talk to a judge?" 
</P>
<P>
"No one can just walk in and talk to a judge," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Even at the forum, only written questions were taken and answered, prompting 
Arthur Sigler of West Los Angeles, who said he had expected a spirited verbal 
exchange, to contend that he felt "cheated" by the controlled, low-key format. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the judges mingled with the crowd after the two-hour forum ended. Those 
whose queries went unanswered and who included their address will receive a 
written answer in the mail, forum organizers promised. 
</P>
<P>
The judicial decorum that permeated the forum was occasionally punctuated by an 
aside, as when Beverly Hills Municipal Court Judge Judith Stein introduced 
herself by saying she was not the "Zsa Zsa" judge. (Judge Charles Rubin, who 
presided at Zsa Zsa Gabor's misdemeanor trial last year, was on the panel 
Tuesday evening, but no one asked him about the headline-grabbing case.) 
</P>
<P>
Another headline case was clearly on citizens' and the judges' minds, as 
illustrated by a question put to Los Angeles Superior Court Judge, James 
Albracht, who hears criminal cases in Santa Monica: What can a judge do to 
limit long trials? 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is -- I don't know," Albracht replied, noting his "fine, wise" 
colleague Superior Court Judge William Pounders' vain efforts to shorten the 
marathon McMartin Preschool molestation trial. 
</P>
<P>
Albracht said current law and interpretations by higher courts, particularly 
the state Supreme Court during the tenure of former Chief Justice Rose Bird, 
have given attorneys a long leash, making it hard "for even a fine judge to 
clamp down on lawyers." He also said that, if a prosecutor chooses to file an 
unwieldy 50- or 100-count case, a judge has little power to pare it down. 
</P>
<P>
That answer, however, drew a sharp retort from Wapner, who said it was wrong to 
blame the higher court or attorneys. "Judges are in charge and you take 
charge," Wapner insisted. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge David Rothman, the supervising judge of the Santa Monica 
courthouse, ended the evening fielding a question that brought a smile to his 
face. It came from a 15-year-old who was contemplating a career in the 
judiciary and wanted to know if Rothman would become a judge all over again if 
given the chance. 
</P>
<P>
"The answer is absolutely," said Rothman. "You touch many lives. . . . The 
money ain't great. The colleagues are terrific, wonderful, bright people." 
</P>
<P>
Judges are called upon daily to make such decisions as the custody of an infant 
-- "a heart-rending decision," said Rothman. "That's the kind of stuff that the 
people whom you're looking at do."

NEW RENT BOARD MEMBER SEEN AS 'PEACEMAKER'; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA MONICA: BOTH SIDES HOPE THAT JAY JOHNSON -- A LANDLORD WHO SUPPORTS RENT 
CONTROL -- CAN BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN OWNERS AND TENANTS.

<P>
The scheduled swearing-in tonight of Jay P. Johnson, a landlord who supports 
rent control, as the fifth member of the Santa Monica Rent Control Board has 
both sides of the rent control debate optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
Some landlords, who have complained for years of the board's domination by 
tenant activists, say they are encouraged that they finally have someone on the 
board who "speaks our language" and understands the economics of owning and 
operating rental units. 
</P>
<P>
Some tenants, meanwhile, say Johnson is a caring and compassionate person who 
is committed to progressive politics and understands the need to protect and 
provide affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Johnson, 47, says having a foot in each camp will help him close 
the chasm between landlords and the rent board. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't know where both sides are coming from, how can you try to come up 
with any workable solutions?" he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's unanimous appointment last week by the four remaining board members 
cleared the way for the board's controversial Incentive Housing Program to get 
off the ground. It followed weeks of a deadlock that had threatened to 
indefinitely hamper board business. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which allows landlords to raise the rents nearly to market level 
on some vacant units if an equal number of units are set aside for low-income 
tenants, was narrowly approved by the board in October, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise program was designed in response to a growing exodus of 
landlords from the rental business in Santa Monica. Under provisions of a state 
law called the Ellis Act, which allows landlords to legally evict tenants and 
put their property to other uses, more than 1,000 apartments in the city have 
been taken off the market in recent years. In local parlance, the process is 
referred to as "Ellising." 
</P>
<P>
As of early this week, 43 applications for the incentive program had been given 
out, but only 19 returned, according to rent board administrator Mary Ann 
Yurkonis. Last week, the board approved four contracts with landlords who will 
participate in the program. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the four landlords, James Baker and Pat Cramer, took part in the 
negotiations that led to the creation of the program last year. 
</P>
<P>
Baker has declined to comment on the program because he is a director of the 
board of a landlords group called Action, which officially opposes the program. 
</P>
<P>
But Cramer, who has an interest in about 300 units, is a vocal supporter. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the program will work," Cramer said. "It will be a big incentive for 
landlords to increase their cash flow. I don't think the program will stop all 
the Ellising, but I think it will slow it down." 
</P>
<P>
The first of several buildings Cramer hopes to include in the program was 
approved last week. The 10-unit building has three vacancies. Cramer is being 
given credit for having an existing low-income tenant, so he will be allowed to 
raise the rents of two of three vacant units. 
</P>
<P>
The average maximum allowable rent imposed by the rent board for the three 
single units is about $350. While he may be forced to lower the rent on one of 
the units to as little as $274, he can legally raise the rents on the other two 
single units to as much as $950, an increase of $600. 
</P>
<P>
Cramer, however, said the market rate for such an apartment is about $600, and 
he expects to rent them for about that price. So while he may have to lower the 
rent on one unit by $76, he would still realize a net increase of $424 per 
month for the three units. 
</P>
<P>
"I think more landlords will participate once they realize the kind of 
increased cash flows they can get," Cramer said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, the newest board member, supports the program. 
</P>
<P>
"I intend to aggressively recruit landlords to participate in the program," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
How successful he will be remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
John Rodriguez, president of Action, said he does not know Johnson very well 
and is reserving comment until after Johnson addresses the landlords group at 
its monthly meeting on April 2. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a little suspicious because of his involvement with (Santa Monicans for 
Renters' Rights) and other leftist organizations," Rodriguez said. "I'm 
guarded, but I welcome the opportunity to meet with him." 
</P>
<P>
Although he is a landlord -- with interests in about 12 rental units in Santa 
Monica -- Johnson is also on the steering committee of Santa Monicans for 
Renters' Rights, the organization that dominates city politics and whose 
members make up a majority of both the City Council and the rent board. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a sales representative for Lee jeans, said he has a "25-year history 
of heavy involvement in numerous social justice movements and political 
campaigns." He was a recent election observer in Nicaragua, is a co-founder of 
the Committee Against Rand Expansion, and is a member of the Santa Monica 
Democratic Club. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he intends to join rent board members Wayne Bauer and Susan Packer 
Davis in their silent protest of U.S. involvement in El Salvador by refraining 
from pledging allegiance to the flag at the beginning of each meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Johnson is also a member of Action and of the Santa Monica Board of 
Realtors. He holds an undergraduate business degree. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems incredible to me that a man can be a liberal and a capitalist," said 
apartment owner Baker. 
</P>
<P>
But it may take that combination to bring peace to what has been an acrimonious 
relationship between the board and landlords. 
</P>
<P>
"Jay is a person who will listen to all sides and decides what is best for all 
concerned," said Brad Jones, co-chairman of SMRR. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he will bring some vitally needed compromises," Baker said. "Jay is a 
peacemaker. I thought I was beyond being surprised by anything the rent board 
did, but Jay's appointment was a surprise. Actually, astounded would be a 
better expression."

FIRM SUES AGENCY AND WINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge last week ordered the Arcadia Redevelopment 
Agency to pay Rentype Inc. $32,500 plus three years' interest for lost profits 
resulting from the agency's precondemnation actions. 
</P>
<P>
The East Huntington Drive office supply firm filed for a building permit to 
remodel its offices in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Rentype President Roger Mabry said the agency refused to permit the remodeling 
unless the company agreed to a list of conditions, one of them being that the 
business would cease to operate within five years. 
</P>
<P>
The agency also wanted the firm to agree not to ask for more than $50,000 in 
reimbursement for any improvements if the agency decided to acquire the 
property, Mabry said. The remodeling would have cost from $100,000 to $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
Rentype, which has since moved to Azusa, rejected the conditions and never got 
the permit. 
</P>
<P>
The agency acquired the business by eminent domain in 1987. The land is now a 
parking lot near the new Automobile Club of Southern California headquarters.

POMONA'S GAY-HUMAN RIGHTS VOTE CRITICIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was dismayed and outraged with the Pomona City Council's decision to renege 
on their previous decision to allow a Gay-Human Rights Week (Times, Feb. 28). 
According to Mayor (Donna) Smith, who gave the deciding vote on this very 
controversial and heated issue, her main reason behind her decision to expel 
gays from Gay-Human Rights Week was that she did not want to give "special" 
rights to select groups. 
</P>
<P>
"Special" rights? Were Mexican-Americans asking for special rights in order to 
celebrate their culture and heritage on Cinco De Mayo Day? Were Afro-Americans 
asking for special rights when they asked to celebrate Martin Luther King Day 
and Black History Month? What about the Irish St. Patrick's Day, a day in which 
our Irish community celebrates their culture and heritage? 
</P>
<P>
Similar to other minorities, which includes Chicanos, Afro-Americans, Asians, 
Mexican-Americans and Jewish Americans, lesbians and gays have their own 
culture, their own heritage. Our history goes way back; for example, did you 
know that Plato was gay? We have experienced the violent prejudice during the 
infamous Stonewall Riots; we have suffered the loss of a great leader, San 
Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk, who was assassinated because of his sexual 
orientation. 
</P>
<P>
The only difference between gays and lesbians being recognized as a unique and 
separate culture compared to other minorities is that we are not all the same 
color. Because our status as a minority group cannot be based on the color of 
our skin or religious orientation we are being refused the same recognition, 
through "pride weeks," that hundreds of other minorities are privileged to 
have. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the people who argued against the proclamation for a Gay-Human Rights 
Week claimed that lesbians and gays choose to be homosexual. I ask you this, 
why would I, as a lesbian woman, choose to live a life style in which I am 
forbidden to legally marry the person I love? In which I am unable to hold my 
partner's hand in public for fear of being attacked? Why would I choose a life 
style where, just by writing this letter and stating my name, I am at risk of 
losing my job or my life? Why would I choose a life style that is not 
recognized but rather ostracized by society? Gays and lesbians are too 
frequently looked upon as strictly sexual beings, but this is not the case. 
</P>
<P>
Lesbians and gays are your mothers, your brothers, your fathers, your sisters, 
your sons and your daughters. We are a loving people who have asked the City 
Council for the right to be recognized as a unique and separate culture. Yet, 
because of (Councilman) Clay Bryant's political game-playing (do his 
constituents realize that it was he who first introduced and approved the 
original proclamation?), (Councilman Mark A. T.) Nymeyer's ignorance and 
homophobia, and Mayor Smith's fear and weakness, gays and lesbians were denied 
the basic human rights given to all minorities in the United States; the right 
to celebrate our culture and heritage as the unique and contributing culture 
that it is.

AGENCY VOTES TO BUY 2 LOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Arcadia Redevelopment Agency on Tuesday voted 4 to 0 to acquire two 
properties on the northwest corner of Huntington Drive and Second Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The agency is composed of members of the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Dennis Lojeski, a dentist with an office within the redevelopment 
area, did not vote because of possible conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Torres' home and Eugene Wingard's cabinet business were condemned 
after the owners and the city deadlocked on price negotiations. Torres had 
rejected the agency's offer of $210,000 for her 8,000-square-foot lot on 
Wheeler Avenue. Wingard, who was asking $800,000 for his 7,500-square-foot 
property on Second Avenue, had rejected the agency's latest offer of about 
$265,000. 
</P>
<P>
The agency, which has condemned three other properties west of Second Avenue 
since December, plans to develop a commercial center at the site.

DEVELOPERS TOLD TO KEEP POLICE MUSEUM IN PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles councilman has decided there should be a shotgun wedding at the 
old Northeast Police Station in Highland Park. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Richard Alatorre has urged two private firms vying to commercially 
develop the historic station to incorporate the plans of a volunteer group that 
wants the 1925 building to be used as a police museum. 
</P>
<P>
Although both private developers said late last month that they are willing to 
consider incorporating the museum into their plans, the nonprofit group would 
prefer to develop the museum project independently. 
</P>
<P>
The three plans -- and the prospect of a combined museum venture -- was to be 
reviewed Wednesday by the City Council's public works committee. Still, Robin 
Kramer, Alatorre's chief of staff, conceded last week, "As we go forward, a 
marriage may not be possible." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, when the Los Angeles Police Department's Northeast Division 
relocated to larger quarters on San Fernando Road, city officials have been 
trying to preserve the 65-year-old Highland Park police station, at 6045 York 
Blvd. Boasting a distinctive Renaissance Revival architectural design, the 
station has been designated a federal and city landmark. 
</P>
<P>
An initial private restoration and development plan collapsed a year ago. 
Alatorre sought new bids from parties willing to restore the station's facade, 
remove asbestos, make the building earthquake-safe and reserve areas for a 
police substation and community use. 
</P>
<P>
Two developers and the police museum organizers submitted plans for the station 
and the surrounding land. 
</P>
<P>
H.T. Greene and Associates of Los Angeles proposed a housing and commercial 
complex. The Jacmar Companies of Alhambra proposed a pizza restaurant and 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Historical Society, founded last November, wants to use 
the site for a police museum, a law enforcement-oriented magnet school and a 
youth services center. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Alatorre urged that the museum be wedded to the commercial plans. 
</P>
<P>
"The police museum proposal has clearly captured the imagination of the 
community, and I feel it would be a good use of the site, but the proposal 
lacks sound financial backing, as well as business, curatorial, arts management 
or development experience," the councilman said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, I'm recommending that we request that the two other bidders, who 
seem to have the financial wherewithal, find a way to marry their respective 
plans to the police museum proposal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Both developers are willing to consider this idea, said Kramer. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles Police Sgt. Richard E. Kalk, who is spearheading the museum 
drive, said a partnership is not needed. He denied that his group lacks the 
financial support or museum expertise to build the project alone. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Alatorre's office is not completely up to date with our board's efforts to 
put this on," he said. "I'm very frustrated that they haven't listened to us." 
</P>
<P>
Kalk, who is president of the Police Historical Society, said two of his board 
members have college degrees in museum management. He said the group is also 
working with a local architect who is experienced in museum design. 
</P>
<P>
Financing remains an obstacle. "Nobody likes to loan money if you don't own the 
building," Kalk said. 
</P>
<P>
But he believes Highland Park leaders and thousands of active and retired 
police officers will assist with funding if his group can acquire the site. 
</P>
<P>
Kalk said joining forces with a developer who wants to put apartments or a 
restaurant on the surrounding land would force the museum backers to give up 
their proposed youth center and magnet school. There would also be insufficient 
room for large outdoor exhibits such as a vintage police helicopter and a 
police van, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kalk recently met with developer H.T. Greene, but did not agree to join forces. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Chattel, a Greene spokesman, said the museum would fit his firm's plans 
because a dance troupe that originally wished to occupy the restored station 
recently moved elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"Our concept has always been that the police station would be used as a 
community center," he said. "It's our intent to make the museum happen." 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the museum organizers, Chattel said, his firm has greater expertise 
in preserving historic buildings and in fund raising. He said his company wants 
to build a cultural showpiece, not just a profitable commercial complex. 
</P>
<P>
"We would not have been interested in this site if the station were not there," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The rival private developer, The Jacmar Companies, has made no commitment on 
incorporating the police museum. "We're not sure at this time until we study 
it," said Jack Keese, Jacmar's vice president of real estate development. 
</P>
<P>
Chattel said his firm is impatient with the lengthy review process. It wants 
the city to negotiate exclusively with H.T. Greene and Associates, instead of 
continuing to string along two or three proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Alatorre aide Kramer pointed out, "The council has the option of finding 
that there are no adequate bids. They could toss them out and start over."

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: DIAMOND BAR; 
</P>
<P>
DRIVE-THROUGH BAN REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday voted down a proposal to prohibit drive-through 
restaurants in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Gary Werner had proposed adopting a provision similar to San 
Marino's zoning code, which bans drive-through establishments. Werner said that 
San Marino has "what I consider to be the highest caliber and quality of 
development," and that similar restrictions would improve the quality of life 
in Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
But his motion, seconded by Mayor Phyllis Papen, lost on a 3-2 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Council members John Forbing and Gary Miller said banning drive-throughs was 
unnecessary, whereas Councilman Paul Horcher accused Werner of being "elitist." 
</P>
<P>
"This is not San Marino, it's Diamond Bar," he said. "It's for the 
middle-class, and we're proud of it."

GLENOAKS CANYON RESIDENTS URGE REJECTION OF 25-HOUSE SUBDIVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Angry Glenoaks Canyon residents Tuesday urged the Glendale City Council to 
either reduce the project's size or drop plans to build 25 hillside houses on 
an extension of Sleepy Hollow Place, south of Glenoaks Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 residents, most of whom were opposed to Doty Development's 
planned subdivision, packed the City Council chambers and spilled into a 
downstairs lobby. The hearing was called to receive public comments about the 
environmental impact report on the tract. 
</P>
<P>
The speakers complained that the project will mar the beauty of the scenic 
hillside area, destroy oak trees, create traffic jams and add to school 
crowding. They said it will invite more hillside building. 
</P>
<P>
"Why destroy our little piece of the world to make it look like the rest of Los 
Angeles?" asked Courtney Kennedy, a nearby resident. "This is only the 
beginning. It will not stop here." 
</P>
<P>
Doty wants to build 25 houses, each priced at about $1 million, on the 30-acre 
site. 
</P>
<P>
After three hours of testimony, the council referred the report to city 
planning officials. They will prepare a final version addressing the residents' 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
The council is expected to vote on the subdivision proposal when the 
environmental report is completed in about a month. The Sleepy Hollow project 
was not affected by a moratorium on hillside development, approved earlier 
Tuesday by the council, because the project was already under city review. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents were angered by Sleepy Hollow's omission from the moratorium. 
One flier circulated in Glenoaks Canyon accused the council of favoring 
developers who contribute to local campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Jerold F. Milner reacted angrily during the hearing, saying, "Let me tell 
you, not one of the people on this council is being bought by anyone." 
</P>
<P>
James C. Crisp, a consultant hired by the city, said the project would destroy 
58 oak trees. Doty's landscape expert told the council 28 would be lost. 
</P>
<P>
Crisp displayed several alternatives to Doty's plan, including constructing a 
second access road and redesigning the subdivision. Another alternative, which 
Crisp said would cause the least environmental damage, permits only 14 houses. 
</P>
<P>
David Weaver, president of the Glenoaks Canyon Homeowners Assn., said his group 
does not want any more development in the area. But if forced to accept the 
Sleepy Hollow project, Weaver said, his board favors only 12 new houses. 
</P>
<P>
Other residents said they would not accept even 12 houses and urged the city to 
reject the proposal and buy the land for open space.

DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOMEOWNERS TO MEET AGAIN OVER SEWER FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Agroup of La Crescenta homeowners will meet again tonight to discuss an 
increase in sewer fees imposed last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Majorie Falloure, the leader of a loosely organized protest group, said rates 
and discounts offered by neighboring districts and cities will be discussed. 
</P>
<P>
Robert E. Yanez, an attorney who will become the newest member of the Crescenta 
Valley Town Council in April, said he has researched fees charged by the 
Crescenta Valley County Water District and will attend the meeting to answer 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
However, Yanez said, he has declined Falloure's request to initiate legal 
action against the water district. "It is not my place to spearhead special 
interest groups," Yanez said. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting is scheduled at 7:30 p.m. at Crescenta Valley High School, 4400 
Ramsdell Ave.

ART MUSEUM WINS GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The James Irvine Foundation has awarded a $100,000 grant to the Santa Monica 
Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
Richard G. Hirsch, president of the museum's board of trustees, said the money 
will be used to hire a full-time development officer for the next two years to 
write grants and raise money for the museum. 
</P>
<P>
The museum, at 2437 Main St., incorporated in 1985 as a tax-exempt, nonprofit 
organization to showcase lesser-known artists. It was formally dedicated last 
September. Its current exhibit, "Lita Albuquerque: Reflections," runs through 
April 1.

RAND HONORS STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As part of its "Adopt-A-School" program, the RAND Corp. this week honored 22 
Santa Monica High School students who participated in the think tank's 
three-month Distinguished Scholars Program. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the students in the program, which teaches students the skills of 
public policy analysis and is taught by doctoral candidates in the RAND 
Graduate School, were cited for exceptional performance and received cash 
awards. 
</P>
<P>
Andrea Kantor received a $150 award and Henry Hecking, Joshua Levine and Marvin 
Lai received $100 awards. 
</P>
<P>
All 22 students were required to research and write a paper addressing some 
aspect of one of four topics: the environment, the pro-life/pro-choice 
controversy, the changing Soviet Union, and income distribution and poverty. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not hard to get a high school student to make recommendations about how 
to solve a problem," said Richard Robinson, who coordinated the program while 
working on his own dissertation, "but it's hard to get them to think about why 
they're making those recommendations. We hope the program taught them how to 
look at the context of a public policy issue and how to develop appropriate 
measures for alternative solutions."

VOTE DELAYED ON RANGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council postponed a vote to hire two park rangers to patrol the city's 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
The Human Services Commission asked the council to consider hiring the park 
rangers to enhance park security. 
</P>
<P>
But several West Hollywood residents argued against the plan, saying the 
$75,000 cost of hiring the rangers was too high. A city report states that 
crime has decreased in the parks since the Sheriff's Department began using 
foot patrols to enforce anti-camping laws four months ago.

THINKING ON HIS FEET PLACES SPRINTER IN FAST COMPANY; 
</P>
<P>
OCCIDENTAL: RONNIE CUNNINGHAM CONVERTS HIS PSYCHOLOGY EXPERTISE TO THE TRACK 
BUT KNOWS WHEN TO LET HIS MUSCLES TAKE OVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although Ronnie Cunningham speaks of sprinting by using technical jargon such 
as "mental mapping" and "sensory engrams," he has learned to clear his mind of 
such complex concepts before a race. 
</P>
<P>
Psychology -- Cunningham's major at Occidental College -- is trampled at the 
sound of the starter's pistol. He has found that thinking during competition 
can be detrimental. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to say, 'Oh God! Oh God!' And get really pumped up about it," he 
said. "I used to get out of the blocks really well, get ahead of everybody, get 
really excited, and my muscles would freeze." 
</P>
<P>
Those muscles have not only thawed, they have burned an indelible impression on 
the competition. Cunningham, a senior, has already qualified for the NCAA 
Division III national championships as a member of the 4x100-meter relay team, 
and has should earn a berth in the 100. He ran a 10.84-second 100 last year to 
finish second in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham, who also played defensive back on the football team, beat a field 
that included runners from San Diego State, a Division I-level school, and Cal 
Poly San Luis Obispo, a perennial Division II track powerhouse, in a recent 
tri-meet. He defeated runners from UCLA and Cal State Bakersfield at another 
meet. One of those runners was UCLA freshman Bert Emanuel, a redshirt 
quarterback who ran a sizzling 10.44 in the 100 during high school. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham noticed his performance was met with raised eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys from UCLA were sorta looking at me weird," he said. "If you're at a 
Division I school getting a scholarship to run, you wouldn't exactly appreciate 
getting beat by a Division III scholar-athlete. I think they were more 
surprised than anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham surprised some folks when he decided to leave Seattle for Los 
Angeles. He estimates he has 120 relatives who live in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter where I am in Seattle, I'm no more than two miles away from a 
relative," said Cunningham, who was told he would probably have to walk on if 
he wanted to play football or run track at a Division I school. He headed for 
Southern California because it was close enough to home, but not too close. 
</P>
<P>
That sounds good in theory, but when Cunningham's mother suffered a stroke 
during his freshman year, he was ready to move back. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to stay home but I couldn't," he said. "My grandmother said that if 
my mom found out I didn't go back to school, she'd get off the bed and kick my 
butt all the way back to L. A." 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham says his mother has "recovered completely" after two brain 
operations. "I just thank my lucky stars," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham, who was awarded a Ford Foundation grant last summer to study 
laboratory rats, plans to pursue his Ph.D. in psychology. Now, however, he is 
concentrating on running. And during the past three track seasons, Cunningham's 
form has improved dramatically. An overzealous attitude, says Coach Bill 
Harvey, was once his nemesis. 
</P>
<P>
"He was trying to catch somebody by gritting his teeth," he said. "A lot of 
people try to strain and it feels like they're going faster, but in reality, 
they're creating their own resistence in their body." 
</P>
<P>
Or, as Cunningham succinctly explained: "You shouldn't let your head try to do 
what your body should be doing." 
</P>
<P>
There are things Cunningham's body shouldn't be doing. A lot of running, for 
instance. 
</P>
<P>
Years of violent pounding from running and jumping -- coupled with the abuse of 
football -- have softened Cunningham's knees. By his sophomore season, it 
became excruciating to sprint. Doctors were initially baffled but eventually 
determined he had bone spurs and tendinitis in both knees. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, last year Harvey told Cunningham to bid adieu to the decathlon 
and the 200. Letting go, especially of the decathlon, was difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"The decathlon is like messing around with a bunch of toys," he said. "I didn't 
mind training." 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham qualified in the event for the 1988 nationals, but was ranked last 
in a 15-man field. At the conclusion of the first day, he was in third place. 
</P>
<P>
On the second day, Cunningham and Harvey argued about the pole-vault height at 
which he should start. Harvey told him to begin at 11 feet to build his 
confidence. Instead, Cunningham started at 12 feet and missed each jump. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to drop out because I was so disappointed," he said. "But I finished 
-- it's just something you do. You start something and regardless of what 
happens, you finish it." 
</P>
<P>
The miscue ultimately cost him a bid at the title and he finished 10th. Since 
that episode, Cunningham has put more stock in Harvey's advice. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to maximize the things he does well rather than get greedy," Harvey 
said, speaking specifically about the decision to forgo the 200 and decathlon. 
"Ronnie will state his case, make his argument and listen to what you will say. 
</P>
<P>
"If he understands that rationale, he'll go with it. That type of maturity 
helps him."

<TEXT>
<P>
The Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet 
Singing in America will hold its 44th benefit concert at the Pasadena Civic 
Auditorium, 300 E. Green St. Tickets are $10 for the 8 p.m. show Friday and $12 
for the 8 p.m. show Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The show features championship groups competing in such categories as song 
arrangement, stage presence and balance and blend of voices. 
</P>
<P>
Each quartet wears costumes appropriate to the group's name. For instance, the 
"Chordiac Arrests" are costumed in surgical greens. The four men in the group 
began singing together in 1987 and while technically and musically excellent, 
they poke fun at many hallowed medical traditions with their lyrics and 
harmony. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds will go to the Institute of Logopedics in Wichita, Kan., which 
provides comprehensive programs focusing on communication for people who have 
speech handicaps.

COVINA APPROVES PAY RAISE FOR FIREFIGHTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

COVINA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Monday approved a three-year salary contract for city 
firefighters, providing average compensation increases estimated at 12%. 
</P>
<P>
Actual salaries will go up by 9% to 20%, contract documents show. But City 
Manager John Thomson said the increases level out to about 12% because the city 
plans to gradually phase out education incentives and is eliminating 
contributions to firefighters' life and long-term disability insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Before the contract was approved, Covina firefighters earned from $2,387 to 
$3,757 a month, depending on job category and seniority. Under the new pact, 
the range is from $3,173 to $4,406. 
</P>
<P>
Under the old contract, employees received $27.50 a month in life insurance and 
long-term disability insurance, and were eligible for special pay of up to $207 
a month for completing higher education. The life and long-term disability 
insurance payments have ceased, and the higher education bonus will be phased 
out by Jan. 1, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The contract was strongly opposed by Mayor Bob Low, who said the city will have 
to dip into reserve funds or cut services to fund the raises. He was the only 
council member to oppose the measure, which passed 4 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
The new wages, retroactive to Jan. 1, will cost the city an additional $197,000 
for the first six months, Thomson said, $132,000 more than was budgeted for 
firefighters' raises this fiscal year. The cost will go up when an additional 
2% to 3% increase scheduled for July goes into effect. 
</P>
<P>
Thomson told the council he probably will use money from the city's reserve 
funds to pay for the raises. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the City Council agreed to survey firefighters' salaries in nine 
other cities, and to pay Covina firefighters the median amount. The cities 
surveyed include Alhambra, Downey and South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
During the second year of the pact, the same cities will be surveyed twice, in 
January and July, and Covina salaries will automatically be adjusted to equal 
the prevailing median. Wages may be re-negotiated in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Low had agreed to the survey but changed his mind when he learned how much 
paying the median wages would cost the city. 
</P>
<P>
"A parent could promise to take his child to Disneyland, but if he suddenly 
loses his job, he'd have to re-evaluate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Gary Coffey said the raises were necessary to keep high-caliber 
firefighters in Covina. "We lose them all the time to cities and counties who 
have more money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighter union President John Gembrini said his 34 members have been paid 
less than their counterparts in other cities for the past three years. They 
received a 9% increase last year and no increases for the previous two years.

GREAT OUTDOORS AIDS MARSHALL

<TEXT>
<P>
Wendy Triplett discovered a novel way to prepare her Marshall High girls' 
basketball team for last Friday's City Section 3-A Division championship game 
at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
After the earthquake shook Marshall's aging cracker-box gym Thursday, Triplett 
moved practice outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to die in there," Triplett said of the Marshall gym. "But once 
we got outside, I said this is a great idea. I think that prepared them a 
little bit." 
</P>
<P>
The switch helped acclimate the Barristers to the uncomfortably wide-open 
feeling that high school teams often experience when they play in cavernous 
arenas. 
</P>
<P>
Behind senior guard Laura Oki, who scored 18 points, Marshall won its second 
consecutive 3-A championship, defeating University, 45-32. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall's season came to an end Tuesday when the Barristers (24-4) suffered a 
63-36 loss to Fresno Clovis West in a Division I quarterfinal game of the 
Southern California regional. 
</P>
<P>
Add titles: The Ribet Academy boys' team defeated St. Margaret's of San Juan 
Capistrano, 68-60, Friday to win the Southern Section Small Schools title. 
Jacquin Moore had a game-high 23 points and Jrmirol Duncan had 19 points for 
the Fighting Frogs, who captured the school's first Southern Section title. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Ribet defated Firebaugh, 95-57, in a Division V quarterfinal of the 
Southern California regional. 
</P>
<P>
The Fighting Frogs will play host to Faith Baptist, a 67-52 winner Tuesday over 
Calipatria, in a semifinal game tonight at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
Season-ender: The La Canada boys' soccer team appeared to have its second 
consecutive Southern Section 1-A title in hand, holding a 1-0 lead going into 
the final 10 minutes of Saturday's championship against Walnut at Gahr High. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like we were in good shape," said La Canada sweeper Ross Allan, who 
gave the Spartans a one-goal lead with about 30 seconds left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Walnut, however, scored a goal to send the game into overtime and went on to 
win, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
"We had our chances -- near the end I had two headers," said Allan, a two-time 
All-Southern Section player. "We had more shots on goal than they did." 
</P>
<P>
La Canada concluded its season 22-2-2. Walnut finished 19-8. 
</P>
<P>
Close, but . . .: The Glendale College basketball team fell just short of 
advancing to the eight-team state tournament finals at UC Irvine when the 
Vaqueros lost an overtime game Saturday to Rancho Santiago, 86-84, in the 
Southern California regional. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale finished 24-12. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the competition we played throughout the year was extremely 
good," Coach Brian Beauchemin said. "At one point, we were 21-6. In that 21 
wins were a lot of road victories that took a lot of effort. From that 
standpoint, it was really a great year." 
</P>
<P>
Down but not out: Pepe Reilly of Glendale finished 10th in the 119-pound 
division at the U. S. Boxing Federation Amateur National Championships last 
week in Colorado Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly, 18, lost a decision to Lionel Odom of New York, who finished second in 
the division. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly, a senior at Hoover High, will begin preparations for the national 
Golden Gloves Championships that begin in April. 
</P>
<P>
Qualifiers: Two more Occidental College athletes have qualified for the NCAA 
Division III track championships. 
</P>
<P>
Pam Childs qualified in the long jump with an 18-foot 2-inch mark last weekend 
at Claremont in an SCIAC dual meet that was won by Occidental and included 
Claremont, Caltech and Pomona-Pitzer. 
</P>
<P>
Heather Beach qualified in the triple jump with a mark of 37-2. Jenny Lawrence 
won three events: the 100 hurdles (16.10 seconds), high jump (5-2), and the 
javelin (117-4) 
</P>
<P>
Brady Dargan won three men's events: the shot put (44-6), discus (140-6) and 
hammer (163-6). 
</P>
<P>
Better than average: Ethan Caldwell, point guard for the Occidental basketball 
team, has been selected to the GTE Academic All-American Team for Division 8, 
which includes West Coast schools. 
</P>
<P>
Caldwell, a senior, averaged 12.4 points for the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
Farewell: Cal State Los Angeles track Coach John Tansley has announced his 
retirement effective at the end of the season. Tansley, in his sixth year at 
Cal State L.A., has led the Golden Eagles to four consecutive California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. titles. 
</P>
<P>
In 14 seasons at Glendale College, Tansley, 54, won four state cross-country 
championships and a state track title.

GROUP UNITES DANCE LOVERS FROM VARIOUS WALKS OF LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The members of the Beverly Hills Dance Ensemble are from diverse backgrounds, 
but when they gracefully dip and turn to the notes of a Fred Astaire medley, 
they all have one thing in common: their love of ballroom dancing. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-member group, which includes two rocket scientists, four engineers and a 
private investigator, will perform a tribute to Astaire for the 43rd annual Los 
Angeles International Folk Dance Festival on Friday night at the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Adrienne Folley, an engineer at McDonnell Douglas Co., said her colleagues 
sometimes think she's "a bit odd" when they find out about her favorite 
pastime. "People have an idea that engineers are boring, stoic, couch-potato 
types. (But) I've found a lot of engineers are quite musical," the West Los 
Angeles resident said. 
</P>
<P>
Folley and the 15 other men and women who make up the dance team practice their 
routines every weekend, said Gloria Monaghan, who founded the team in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
The ensemble will perform along with 500 other dancers, singers and folk 
musicians from all over the world in Friday's one-night festival, the region's 
largest and oldest multi-ethnic stage presentation. 
</P>
<P>
The Astaire tribute that the team will perform is just one of a large 
repertoire of their routines, Monaghan said. This year's appearance at the folk 
dance festival will be the team's 10th, an achievement that festival producer 
Irwin Parnes attributed to the group's versatility, from the Astaire tribute to 
Austrian folk dancing. 
</P>
<P>
Although none of the members dance for a living, they all get up early every 
Saturday and Sunday morning to be at the Hollywood Dance Center by 8 a.m. to 
practice for two hours. They earn money to pay for their authentic-looking 
costumes and props from competition prizes and performance fees, Monaghan said. 
</P>
<P>
Monaghan, who runs cotillions for hundreds of fourth-graders through 
12th-graders in the Los Angeles area every month, said she has found that 
ballroom dancing continues to appeal to the young and old alike. Her students 
"come in thinking they want rock 'n' roll, and they leave loving the waltz and 
the tango and the cha-cha."

All of the ensemble dancers have their own reasons for making room for ballroom 
dancing in their busy lives. 
</P>
<P>
Folley, 30, who has competed in other types of dancing, said the performing has 
helped her at work at McDonnell Douglas. "It helps give me the confidence to 
give presentations and deal with customers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Crosby, 29, whom Monaghan described as a former "beach kid," has danced 
with the team for 10 years. "When I was a kid, my parents made me go to 
cotillion," the blond resident of Pacific Palisades said. "I came back to it in 
high school. Over the years, it's been fun, being able to be a part of 
something very classy and unique." 
</P>
<P>
James Tang, a 37-year-old customs broker, said it's the challenge of team 
dancing that has kept him in the group for seven years. "I like formation 
dancing because it takes all eight couples to make the dance work. It takes a 
lot of time and commitment. If you don't show up, you're messing up the other 
seven couples." 
</P>
<P>
To Jim Kranyak of Van Nuys, 33, the ensemble is just a natural extension of his 
musical background. His mother was a singer in big bands, and he had training 
in singing and the piano as a youngster. As an undergraduate at UCLA, he 
belonged to the social dance club. 
</P>
<P>
Now a computer consultant, Kranyak said the ballroom dancing is "a nice way to 
combine the dancing, singing and performing." Besides, he said, he's a 
dedicated fan of Astaire and big band music.

EX-MAYOR SEEKS REINSTATEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Diamond Bar City Councilman Paul Horcher, ousted a month ago as mayor pro tem, 
is accusing his fellow council members of violating state law in removing him, 
and has demanded the post back. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday night's council meeting, Horcher said council members violated the 
Ralph M. Brown Act when they discussed his potential ouster days before they 
formally voted to remove him and to appoint Councilman Gary Werner to the 
position. 
</P>
<P>
"I am asking that their action be rescinded for blatant disregard of the Brown 
Act," Horcher said, passing out to the City Council copies of a letter from his 
attorney, Carlos F. Negrete. 
</P>
<P>
The act, which requires government officials to hold meetings in public under 
most circumstances, prohibits one council member from telephoning or meeting 
with other council members for purposes of reaching a decision, City Atty. 
Andrew Arczynski said. However, he noted, he does not believe the act was 
violated in this case. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Phyllis Papen proposed Horcher's ouster after he personally attacked 
Councilman Gary Miller, then a candidate for state Senate, and accused him of 
conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, the mayor denied violating the Brown Act. She said she telephoned the 
three other council members "to tell them I was putting it on the agenda. We 
did not make a decision."

MONROVIA APPROVES LAND SWAP

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council decided Tuesday to negotiate with a national land conservation 
organization that wants to buy 1,200 hillside acres for $648,000. 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit Trust for Public Lands, based in San Francisco, will pass on the 
land to the Angeles National Forest in return for parcels that are less 
desirable as forest land or more appropriate for development, said trust 
spokesman Tom Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the trust completed a similar land swap, involving 634 acres, with 
Monrovia. That land is now within the Angeles National Forest, which in return 
gave the trust 150 acres in the Lake Hughes area. The trust later sold the Lake 
Hughes parcels to the county Sanitation Districts for a sewage treatment plant, 
Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
The trust, which has put 460,000 acres of land into public ownership since its 
creation in 1973, has started discussions with Pasadena and Sierra Madre to buy 
some of their land.

One person was killed and at least 134 people were missing after a boat 
carrying 209 people collided with a freighter and sank in the Amazon River near 
Iquitos, 715 miles northeast of Lima, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the passengers were children returning from holiday. The vessel's 
helmsman told police that its engine failed and it began drifting, hitting 
several small boats anchored near shore and then careening into a large 
freighter. The river boat rolled over and sank within minutes, police said.

U.S. and Panamanian officials signed an agreement that provides $25.1 million

20. It was the first in a series of aid packages the Administration plans for 
Panama. But President Guillermo Endara, who is in the seventh day of a hunger

Britain, under pressure from neighboring countries to improve its pollution

Britain, the only nation bordering the North Sea that still dumps sewage sludge

in The Hague, Netherlands, to reduce by 70% from 1985 levels the amount of 
cadmium, mercury, dioxin and lead it dumps into the sea by 1995.

Authorities said they will probably never know whether a farm worker who died 
of pesticide poisoning Jan. 20 was a victim of murder, an accident or suicide. 
Jose Campos Martinez died after spraying almond trees with the potent pesticide 
parathion in the Wasco area. "We found parathion in his stomach but not on his 
skin, not on his clothing and not in his liver, lungs or kidneys," said Jim 
Malouf, chief investigator in the Kern County coroner's office.

California State University officials, criticized for quietly giving themselves 
fat raises last year, now are under fire for secretly buying themselves cars 
with state funds. 
</P>
<P>
The university bought six Ford Taurus automobiles for vice chancellors, 
apparently without public discussion, the San Jose Mercury News reported. The 
cars cost a total of $99,998.70, just $1.30 below the threshold for an 
automatic review by the state Department of Finance. A CSU budget officer said 
the price was a coincidence.

Arizona Wilderness 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 356 to 45, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 2570) setting 
aside 1.1 million Bureau of Land Management acres in Arizona as federal 
wilderness to be permanently protected against degradation. 
</P>
<P>
The measure opens an additional 950,000 of bureau acres to uses such as mining 
and grazing. 
</P>
<P>
It is one of a series of bills Congress has taken up in recent years to 
preserve large wilderness areas in most states. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Morris Udall (D-Ariz.) said people should have "the strength, the 
courage and the wisdom to leave at least these places as we found them." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Bob Stump (R-Ariz.) called the bill "an overzealous effort to protect 
public lands from human intrusion." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the wilderness bill.

PRO BASKETBALL: COACH MAKES A STATEMENT AND TEAM RESPONDS TO BEAT MAVERICKS, 
103-91.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pat Riley often cloaks his criticism in trendy psychological catch-phrases. 
Rarely will the Laker coach publicly tear into his players with his 
approximation of street language. 
</P>
<P>
But even an erudite, post-modern coach such as Riley sometimes needs to deliver 
an old-fashioned chewing out, sprinkled with profanity, and the opportunity 
arose 20 seconds into the second quarter of the Lakers' 103-91 victory over the 
Dallas Mavericks here Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Coming off a blowout loss to Houston a night earlier, the Lakers once again 
were flailing about, seemingly without purpose, against the Mavericks. And, 
when Maverick center Bill Wennington scored over Orlando Woolridge on a second 
shot for 12-point Dallas lead, Riley hastily called a 20-second timeout. 
</P>
<P>
Using language he usually reserves for the privacy of the locker room, Riley 
spent those 20 seconds barking unexpurgated insults like Don Rickles in Vegas. 
What it did was shock the Lakers into recognizing and rectifying their 
defensive inertia. 
</P>
<P>
The result: A 22-9 Laker run that erased Dallas' lead and ultimately gave the 
Lakers' a five-point halftime margin they never relinquished. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way for us to get our game going is to rebound and run, and (Riley) 
stressed those points quite strongly," said Woolridge, laughing. "That's 
something we needed to hear then. It helped. It was typical coach fashion. You 
can fill in the . . . blanks." 
</P>
<P>
It was not as if Riley had never resorted to harsh words with his players. He 
just rarely is so vocal in public. Laker players, it turned out, were more 
inspired than embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
"He should have got on everybody at that point," Magic Johnson said. "You 
shouldn't let what happened happen. And he said it in some words that got 
through to us." 
</P>
<P>
All Riley would say about his explosion was this: "You have to make a 
statement." 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the night, Riley had nothing but statements of praise for the way 
his players responded in improving their record to 44-14, especially since 
guard Byron Scott missed his second game in a row with a strained left 
hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
While Riley and others credited the defensive commitment as the galvanizing 
force in the victory, which kept the Lakers 3 1/2 games ahead of Portland in 
the Pacific Division, there also were outstanding individual performances. 
</P>
<P>
A wiser Woolridge was not beaten again defensively after the tongue-lashing, 
and became an offensive force. He scored 12 points in the Lakers' 
second-quarter turnaround and finished with 22. Included were two consecutive 
spectacular dunks early in the fourth quarter that gave the Lakers a 13-point 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
In Scott's absence, Johnson provided ample backcourt scoring. Playing with a 
sore lower back, a sore thigh and bruised right knee after being bumped late in 
the first quarter, Johnson sank four three-point shots, tying his season high, 
and had 21 points and 11 assists. 
</P>
<P>
And James Worthy overcame a slow offensive start to almost single-handedly 
ensure the victory. Worthy had only 10 points through three quarters, but had 
14 of the Lakers' 27 fourth-quarter points. At one point, Worthy scored nine 
consecutive Laker points, including a desperation three-pointer from the corner 
with 4:28 left that increased the lead from four to seven points. 
</P>
<P>
Riley's contention is that the renewed defensive effort opened the offense for 
Worthy, Woolridge and others. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a defensive win," Riley said. "We tried to ask ourselves why we were so 
flat (in Tuesday night's 17-point loss to Houston) and it all comes down to the 
effort and energy. We just declared we were going to win on the road and do it 
with defense." 
</P>
<P>
Dallas still out-rebounded the Lakers, 42-35. But the Laker defense, in the 
final three quarters, forced the Mavericks into poor shots. Dallas shot 54% in 
the first quarter, then 38.4% the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"After the first quarter, we played our game offensively and defensively," 
Johnson said. "We got the outside game going and James and Orlando got the 
inside game going." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Cooper started in Scott's absence for the second consecutive night, and 
his contributions were mainly defensive. 
</P>
<P>
The offensive slack was picked up by Johnson, who now has made 37% of his 
three-point shots, and Woolridge, who made 10 of 13 attempts. Worthy had 
trouble finding open shots in the first half, but broke loose in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Said Riley: "James has got to learn that when people push him off the block he 
has got to run the break and get some different shots other than his inside 
play." 
</P>
<P>
The coach made that assessment soothingly. He had yelled enough for one night. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson bumped knees with a Maverick late in the second quarter and 
limped for a while. Said Johnson: "My lower back was messed up. My thigh hurt. 
My knees. It was a whole lot of stuff; but mostly my thigh." . . . Derek Harper 
led Dallas with 24 points, Rolando Blackman 16. 
</P>
<P>
Byron Scott reported that his strained left hamstring still is sore, but that 
he hopes to play in Friday night's home game against the Golden State Warriors. 
Coach Pat Riley said he might use James Worthy and even Orlando Woolridge at 
the off-guard spot until Scott returns.

MARYLAND ADJUSTS ITS FOCUS; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: TERRAPINS TURN THEIR ATTENTION TO THE ATLANTIC COAST 
CONFERENCE TOURNAMENT AND AWAY FROM NCAA PROBATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Apart from a brief detour Monday morning to the North Gym of Cole Field House, 
Gary Williams has spent much of this week in his own safe haven, coaching on a 
basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what I'm supposed to do, not sit around answering questions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Of course there are many questions to be answered over the next few days, 
Maryland's chances of beating Duke Friday in the opening round of the Atlantic 
Coast Conference tournament and whether the Terrapins will be added to the NCAA 
tournament field Sunday evening foremost among them. 
</P>
<P>
But for Williams, those queries are infinitely preferable to those stemming 
from Monday's announcement of Maryland's three-year NCAA probation, which 
includes a ban on live television next season as well as post-season play in 
1991 and '92. The sanctions also foster more unpleasantries -- namely, can the 
program prosper under what should be a distinct advantage to other schools in 
terms of recruiting? 
</P>
<P>
"I made a long-term commitment to be here," Williams said. "Anyway, I think we 
can overcome this." 
</P>
<P>
Some feel Williams's resolve crystalized when the NCAA's Committee on 
Infractions report cleared him of any culpability in Maryland's troubles. 
Williams said he never doubted that would be the case. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm clear as far as the NCAA is concerned," he said. "People can look at the 
20 years that I've been coaching -- there are no shots to take at me." 
</P>
<P>
There are two steps to Maryland's maintaining the strides it made during an 
18-12 regular season, the immediate task being the ACC tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Since Monday's announcement of the NCAA sanctions, Williams has maintained that 
it will be business as usual for the Terrapins. That was true in Wednesday's 
practice at Cole. At one point Williams called his players and blistered them 
for trying to get through the week without working hard. 
</P>
<P>
"If we get waxed by Duke by 20 points Friday, I guarantee you'll be playing 
here in the NIT next week," he told them. "That's the truth." 
</P>
<P>
There's no telling how this week's events will affect Maryland on the court. 
Some argue the Terrapins will become the ACC tournament darlings and play with 
inspiration. Others say they will play at an emotional nadir, easy pickings for 
the nationally ranked Blue Devils. 
</P>
<P>
But as far as Williams is concerned, both points are bogus. 
</P>
<P>
"We aren't going to use any of this stuff as motivation," he said. "We have a 
lot of pride and we don't need outside help. If we can't get ready to play Duke 
in the first round of the ACC tournament, playing for a spot in the NCAAs, 
something's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Those close to Williams say he wouldn't act any other way. 
</P>
<P>
"This weekend is his main focus; he's such a strong person. If this week has 
bothered him you wouldn't know it," said assistant coach Adam Preyer. "He's 
been nothing but positive with us, positive with the kids. If we lose, we won't 
have any excuses." 
</P>
<P>
Just how long Williams and Maryland are able to maintain that attitude remains 
to be seen. Along with the television and tournament bans, Maryland will lose 
two basketball scholarships for each of the next two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
For next year, there are just two scholarships available, and one has been 
committed to John Leahy, a 6-foot-7 guard from Stone Harbor, N.J. On Tuesday 
another of Maryland's assistant coaches, Billy Hahn, traveled to meet with 
Leahy and his family. 
</P>
<P>
"He's still coming to Maryland, he's very emphatic about that," Hahn said. 
"He's not pleased with the situation, obviously, but his decision isn't going 
to change." 
</P>
<P>
Already a staple of recruiting, such baby-sitting and hands-on management of 
prospects may become essential for Maryland to sign players -- and keep the 
ones already on campus. The length of the sanctions allows any of the 
Terrapins' sophomore and junior players to transfer without having to sit out a 
year and there's a question whether Jerrod Mustaf, Walt Williams and Jesse 
Martin will remain. 
</P>
<P>
"What they've done is tell Walt or Jesse or Jerrod that they can never play in 
an NCAA tournament after this year if they stay," Gary Williams said. "That's 
tough on them, but players also have to realize that getting into the NCAA 
tournament can be a one-game deal too. They can't base their whole decision on 
that." 
</P>
<P>
The decision to cut Maryland's scholarships is considered a minor punishment by 
the NCAA, but Williams doesn't agree. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that we're able to find a couple of good walk-on players because you 
need bodies for the way we play," he said. "The pressure defense that we use 
needs five guys out there all the time; we're going five on five full court 
most of the time. What happens if you're down to 13 players and you get a 
couple of guys hurt? You can't play the way you want to play."

Good news travels last. At least in the newspaper business. Bad news travels 
first. Calamities get priority. If you want to be happy, skip Page 1. Go right 
to the Food section. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, New York magazine took cognizance of this melancholy trend in daily 
journalism and invited readers to send in examples of what they would consider 
good news for subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
The samples, as reprinted in Reader's Digest, were interesting: 
</P>

 -- "Don't bother with the whole form, just fill in your name."

<P>
 -- "This program is presented without commercial interruption."

NEWSWIRE: VALVANO NEGOTIATIONS GET STATE INVOLVEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the request of the University of North Carolina Board of Governors, a 
representative of the state attorney general's office and a private lawyer will 
help North Carolina State negotiate a contract settlement with basketball Coach 
Jim Valvano, state officials said Wednesday in Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Vanore Jr., chief deputy attorney general, will represent the state. 
John Simmons, a spokesman for Attorney General Lacy Thornburg, said the school 
will be represented by Raleigh lawyer Howard Manning, who specializes in civil 
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
Manning is scheduled to meet Friday in Chapel Hill with the UNC system board. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Robert (Roddy) Jones said the meeting may give board members a chance 
to learn about issues "that we may not now know." 
</P>
<P>
Jones told The News and Observer of Raleigh that he didn't expect negotiations 
with Valvano to continue until after the board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The school reportedly wants to avoid a costly settlement such as the one 
reached with North Carolina football Coach Dick Crum, who received $800,000 
after resigning after the 1987 season. 
</P>
<P>
Valvano has been under fire since former Wolfpack star Charles Shackleford 
admitted receiving $65,000 while in school. Shackleford and three unnamed 
former N.C. State players also were accused of point-shaving in an ABC News 
report. Shackleford has denied the allegations, which are being investigated by 
the State Bureau of Investigation. 
</P>
<P>
If N.C. State fires Valvano without cause, it must pay him $500,000. However, 
the payment isn't required if the coach is found guilty of a felony or a major 
NCAA violation.

CANADIAN PAIR NEARLY SCORES UPSET

It seemed as if all the three Soviet figure skating pairs had to do Wednesday 
night in the final phase of their competition was show up at the Halifax Metro 
Centre to collect their World Championship medals. The only question was which 
pairs would win which medals. 
</P>
<P>
But the crowd-pleasing Canadian pair of Isabelle Brasseur and Lloyd Eisler, who 
finished third in their own national championships last month, came within one 
judge's scores of upsetting the defending champions, Ekaterina Gordeeva and 
Sergei Grinkov, in the freestyle program and surprised even themselves by 
winning a silver medal. 
</P>
<P>
Such is the state of Soviet pairs skating that they were disappointed with a 
first, a third and a fourth. Gordeeva and Grinkov, four-time world champions 
and 1988 Winter Olympic gold medalists, gave the Soviets their 23rd pairs world 
championship in the last 26 years. 
</P>
<P>
There was a question, however, in all but the judge's minds about whether 
Gordeeva and Grinkov were the best Soviet pair. Natalia Mishkutenok and Artur 
Dmitriev, the third-place team, did not have programs that were as technically 
challenging as those of Gordeeva and Grinkov, but the skaters were more 
innovative and made fewer mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
Gordeeva seems less enthralled, and enthralling, than she did two years ago at 
the Winter Olympics. Their coach, Stanislav Leonovich, said it only appears so 
because she has grown eight inches to 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
But Gordeeva, 18, admitted last month at the European championships that she is 
losing her motivation.

TRENARY GETS BIG LEAD IN COMPULSORY FIGURES; ITO DROPS TO 10TH

<TEXT>
<P>
The Midori Ito dynasty that was predicted for women's figure skating might have 
come to an inglorious end Wednesday only one year after it started. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's Ito, who won the 1989 World championship as a 19-year-old, had one of 
the worst experiences with ice since the Titanic, finishing 10th in the 
compulsory figures at the Dartmouth Sportsplex. 
</P>
<P>
Three-time U.S. champion Jill Trenary, who seemed resigned earlier in the week 
to placing second behind Ito, won the figures, which count toward 20% of the 
final score, and emerged as the clear favorite to win the championship. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Ito's technically superior freestyle skating earns her first places in 
the final two phases of the competition, she cannot win unless Trenary falls 
below third place in both. Considering the lack of depth in women's skating, 
and the composure the 21-year-old Trenary displayed last month in winning the 
U.S. championship, that is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
It was the last stand for compulsory figures, which have been eliminated from 
future competitions, and they went out dramatically. If they did not absolutely 
determine which skater will win, then they might at least have determined which 
one will not. 
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia's Zeljka Cizmesija skated the final figure, for which she was 
honored with a bouquet of roses, a box of chocolates and a standing ovation 
from a crowd of about 400. 
</P>
<P>
It was difficult to determine whether to interpret the cheers as tribute to 
figures, which have been an important part of the sport since the beginning, or 
as good riddance. Johnny Esaw, the figure skating commentator for the Canadian 
Broadcasting Co., said he has three descriptions of figures: "Dull, dull and 
dull." 
</P>
<P>
But Ito threatened to make them exciting, almost stumbling on the second of two 
figures. One of the nine judges gave her 25th place, out of 29, for that one. 
Ito finished sixth on the first figure and 14th on the second figure for 10th 
place overall. She was sixth in figures last year, when she won the 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
"Midori was out of control out there," said Carlo Fassi, who coaches Trenary in 
Colorado Springs, Colo. "I don't know why. She can do figures. I think she was 
nervous. Last year, everything she did was wonderful. This year, there was more 
pressure on her." 
</P>
<P>
Trenary, from Minnetonka, Minn., finished first on the first figure and second 
on the second to Holly Cook of Bountiful, Utah. Cook is fourth overall. Natalia 
Lebedeva of the Soviet Union is second, and Patricia Neske, who is from 
Hawthorne but represents West Germany because both of her parents are from that 
country, is third. Kristi Yamaguchi of Fremont, Calif., is ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Fassi said the challenge facing Trenary is to maintain her concentration. He 
spoke as if the only one who can beat Trenary is Trenary. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little concerned," he said. "She likes to be the underdog, the one who 
fights for the title. She has to go out and attack. If she sits back, she could 
be in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Trenary, third in the World Championships last year, said she will not alter 
her freestyle programs to protect her lead. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be deadly for me to start focusing on how big a lead I have," she 
said. "I came in here being the underdog. Everything I've heard is that (Ito) 
is totally superior to everybody else, which is easier for me to handle. I 
don't want to be the total favorite." 
</P>
<P>
Fassi said he and his wife, Christa, will do nothing to disturb Trenary's 
emotional balance. 
</P>
<P>
"We do nothing," he said. "We only stay away. We make no arguments. We'll tell 
her she looks wonderful, she has a nice dress." 
</P>
<P>
In the men's competition, the Soviet Union's Viktor Petrenko moved into first 
place, but it took an exceptional original program, after judges gave defending 
champion Kurt Browning of Canada generous scores at the Halifax Metro Centre. 
</P>
<P>
Browning left out one required element and had a poor landing on a double axel, 
but he received high marks, including one perfect 6.0 for artistic impression. 
</P>
<P>
Petrenko then landed two triple axels and skated flawlessly. He received two 
6.0s for artistic impression. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. champion Todd Eldredge, who trains in San Diego, moved into third place 
overall, barely ahead of West Germany's Richard Zander, who grew up in 
Huntington Beach. Christopher Bowman of Van Nuys is fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Either Petrenko or Browning probably will become the champion after tonight's 
freestyle program.

THE DEATH OF HANK GATHERS; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTH CAROLINA PLAYER STUNNED; 
</P>
<P>
HEART CONDITIONS: DOCTOR SAYS A PACEMAKER WILL ALLOW JOE RHETT TO RETURN TO 
BASKETBALL COURT, BUT GATHERS' DEATH HAS THE 6-8 FORWARD WONDERING.

<P>
News of Hank Gathers' death stopped Joe Rhett. 
</P>
<P>
Now he's wondering about his athletic future. 
</P>
<P>
A 6-foot-8, 190-pound forward at the University of South Carolina, Rhett has an 
irregular heartbeat similar to the one that the late Loyola Marymount 
basketball star had. 
</P>
<P>
Like Gathers, Rhett had a fainting spelling. In fact, Rhett had two, both of 
which were suffered off the court in February. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Gathers, however, the 19-year-old Rhett has a heartbeat that is slower 
than normal. Rhett's heart slowed at times and even stopped beating for eight- 
to 10-second intervals. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary check by physicians, however, indicated that Rhett was all right. 
</P>
<P>
"They ran all these tests on me and couldn't find anything," Rhett told the 
Independent-Mail in Anderson, S.C., in February. "They told me there was 
nothing wrong, and I really felt normal." 
</P>
<P>
But Dr. Robert Schulze, a cardiologist at Richland Memorial Hospital in 
Columbia, S.C., wanted to make sure nothing was wrong, so he had Rhett wear a 
heart-monitoring device for 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Further tests revealed the irregularity, and on Feb. 23 Schulze surgically 
implanted a silver dollar-sized pacemaker in Rhett's heart that he said will 
allow the athlete to live a normal life and return to the basketball court next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The pacemaker will supply energy to stimulate Rhett's heart when it slows or 
fails to beat on its own. 
</P>
<P>
"He felt fairly confident with how he was doing," Schulze said from Columbia on 
Wednesday, "until he heard that Hank Gathers dropped dead. He felt the same 
thing could happen to him." 
</P>
<P>
That's highly unlikely, Schulze said. At a news conference after the 60-minute 
operation, he said: "There are periods when (Rhett's) heart essentially stops 
beating. . . . This is a typical problem in elderly patients. It's extremely 
unusual, but not unheard of, in patients Joe's age." 
</P>
<P>
Schulze also said: "My opinion is that he will be able to return to competitive 
basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Last year Rhett was the only freshman named to the Metro Conference 
all-tournament team. This season he started in 21 games and averaged 11 points 
and 7.9 rebounds. In his last game against Southern Mississippi on Feb. 17, 
Rhett had 21 points and 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
His mother, Mary, said Rhett was "very shaken up" after hearing about Gathers' 
death through a friend. 
</P>
<P>
"The Gathers thing shocked him but he's doing fine," Mary Rhett said by phone 
from Columbia. "He won't comment because his coach told him not to talk to any 
press people." 
</P>
<P>
But on Monday, Joe Rhett told the Associated Press: "At first I didn't believe 
it. It shocked me. It hurt me inside. I was almost in tears." 
</P>
<P>
Rhett also said Gathers' sudden death affected him deeply. "I'll just have to 
see how I feel within when it's time to go (back to basketball)," he said. 
"After surgery and before what happened to Hank, I felt real confident I'd be 
back, but now it's real scary. For me, it's a tough situation." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Rhett, however, said there is nothing to stop her son from playing next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe had a checkup yesterday, and the doctor said it's not the same thing (as 
Gathers')," she said. "There's nothing wrong with his heart (with the 
pacemaker). I believe he'll be back next year, and the doctor believes it, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
Schulze agreed: "Joe is going to be fine. Nothing is for sure now, but we 
anticipate that he will be back."

THE DEATH OF HANK GATHERS; 
</P>
<P>
THE EXTENT OF DOCTORS' ROLE BECOMES POINT OF CONTENTION; 
</P>
<P>
ETHICS: GATHERS' DEATH RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY OF BOTH THE 
UNIVERSITY AND THE TEAM PHYSICIANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH J. GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
The death of Loyola Marymount basketball star Hank Gathers has raised questions 
about the role physicians play in the arena of big-time college athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Medical ethicists agree that if Gathers ignored the advice of a cardiologist 
that he should stop playing basketball, then there was little the physician 
could do to stop him outside of breaking an adult patient's right to privacy. 
</P>
<P>
But in cases where the health risks to an athlete appear great enough, should 
university or team officials insist that they be informed so that they can 
determine a course of action? Should it be the team physician's duty to monitor 
a player's compliance with their prescribed medical treatment? 
</P>
<P>
And should an athlete, informed of the risks, have the final say in cases where 
the player's decision may be colored by the lure of great financial rewards in 
a professional sports career? 
</P>
<P>
"Physicians are always torn by their interest in the health of the athlete as 
well as the athlete's overall desire to play," said Arthur Caplan, director of 
the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the University of Minnesota. "But it's 
always up to the patient to weigh the risks, and the presumption is that 
ultimately the patient will determine the course of medical care. 
</P>
<P>
"In cases like this, however, the physicians have a strong obligation not just 
to tell the patient what the risks are, but to make sure that they understand 
what they are. That is especially important since most young athletes see 
themselves as immortal." 
</P>
<P>
A cardiologist familiar with Gathers' case told the Times that the Loyola star 
was told not to play basketball, or even to exercise, if he wanted to reduce 
the risk to his health. He said Gathers ignored the advice, but Loyola 
officials said they were never told of the cardiologist's assessment. 
</P>
<P>
Medical ethicists say that in cases where physicians may have trouble assessing 
the degree of risk a person faces from a heart abnormality, it becomes more 
difficult for doctors to convince players that their health may be endangered. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly an ethical physician will couch a serious health risk in terms that 
the player can understand, such as, 'If you keep playing, you could die,' " 
said Dr. Albert Jonsen, professor of ethics and medicine at the University of 
Washington School of Medicine. "But, just as clearly, the young man with a 
promising sports career may not accept that, especially if he feels healthy." 
</P>
<P>
The lines of medical responsibility are further clouded by the fact that there 
are few cases in which a physician can tell a patient absolutely what exercise 
they should or should not do. 
</P>
<P>
Although Gathers was known to have had so-called cardiac arrhythmia, an 
abnormality of the rate of the heartbeat, the precise cause of his death is 
unknown. The Los Angeles County coroner's office has ordered further 
toxicological tests and tissue studies and the results probably won't be known 
for several days. 
</P>
<P>
However, the New York Times, citing an unidentified physician, reported 
Wednesday that Gathers' condition was diagnosed as a potentially fatal heart 
disease called cardiomyopathy. A conference of cardiologists on sudden death in 
athletes concluded four years ago that persons with cardiomyopathy should be 
disqualified from competitive sports. But university officials said they were 
unaware that Gathers had been diagnosed with that heart condition. 
</P>
<P>
Jonsen said that the involvement of other parties, such as team physicians, in 
the doctor-patient relationship is usually determined by the patient. But he 
said if it becomes necessary to ensure that an athlete is receiving proper 
treatment and advice, then it's up to the university to insist that the results 
of any medical examination be shared with school officials. 
</P>
<P>
"If the university has correct knowledge of the patients' situation, then the 
university has an obligation in making sure that the patient is not put at high 
risk," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Dr. Steven Van Camp, a San Diego cardiologist and vice president of 
the American College of Sports Medicine, said that team physicians should have 
the ultimate responsibility for whether an athlete can continue to play. 
</P>
<P>
"It should be up to the team physician to decide and the university should have 
consultants in areas in which the team physician doesn't have expertise," he 
said. "The bottom line is that somebody needs to come up with the opinion on 
whether an athlete should continue playing. And if you are playing on a 
university team, then the university must take the responsibility of providing 
appropriate medical care." 
</P>
<P>
Caplan said that although the final decision rests with the patient, it is up 
to the physicians to be aware of boundaries set for continued participation in 
athletics. He said that what remains unclear from the Gathers case is whether 
physicians and university officials are going far enough to protect the 
interest of student athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to respect the choice a patient makes," he said. "Physicians who 
treat people who work in high construction jobs or who race automobiles must 
tell them what the risks are, and we should not make any exception for 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"But there is some danger in American society in losing sight of the interest 
of an athlete in the face of all the pressures from fans and schools and future 
financial success."

LITTLE TEAMS OPEN FESTIVITIES IN 11TH BIG EAST TOURNAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Big East Conference tournament begins tonight at New York's Madison Square 
Garden with the elimination game between eighth-seeded Pittsburgh (11-16) and 
ninth-seeded Boston College (8-19), which scored only one conference victory 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
The winner advances to Friday's quarterfinal round and an appointment with No. 
1-seeded Syracuse (22-5), the nation's fourth-ranked team. 
</P>
<P>
Also scheduled for Friday: Connecticut (25-5), ranked eighth, vs. Seton Hall 
(12-15), which nearly won a national championship last season; Georgetown 
(22-5), ranked fifth, vs. Providence (17-10), and St. John's (23-8) vs. 
Villanova (17-13). 
</P>
<P>
The championship game will be played Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
This tournament is usually a plaything for Syracuse and Georgetown. The 
Orangemen or Hoyas have won eight of the 10 postseason titles (Syracuse two, 
Georgetown six) and only one championship game was played without either team 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to pick a favorite, Connecticut Coach Jim Calhoun chose Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
"I would think right now, the team that has been most devastating to us is 
Georgetown," he said. "Syracuse, when they crank it up, is strong. We're 
third." 
</P>
<P>
Just to be safe, Calhoun also didn't rule out Providence, because of a lineup 
that includes five seniors who played on a Final Four team, and St. John's, 
because of guard Boo Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
The point, he said, is that the Big East lends itself to upsets. Underrated 
Seton Hall was a last-second shot away from winning a national championship 
last year. This season, who knows? 
</P>
<P>
"The elevator in our league works very nicely," Calhoun said.

GARRIDO BRINGS ILLINI TO SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Augie Garrido and the University of Illinois baseball team are on the road 
again. 
</P>
<P>
The Fighting Illini have already completed swings through Florida, Nevada and 
Texas, and they'll be in Louisiana this weekend before arriving at UCLA March 
17 for the first of seven games in the Southland. It's Garrido's first 
competitive trip to California since leaving Cal State Fullerton, where he won 
two national championships and 12 conference titles, compiling a 667-292-6 
record in 15 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the stops we need to make to complete our player development 
program," Garrido said of the trip. "It's not necessarily a recruiting tool, 
just another important place to play, so our players get a good feel for the 
quality of teams and players throughout the country." 
</P>
<P>
Last season, with a team made up predominantly of freshmen and sophomores, the 
Illini were 42-16, winning the Big Ten Conference tournament and advancing to 
the NCAA Northeast Regional. 
</P>
<P>
This season, they are 7-5 and ranked eighth by Baseball America magazine. The 
Illini, whose roster includes 10 players from Southern California, finished 
second to Cal State Long Beach at a tournament in Florida, won a tournament two 
weeks ago in Las Vegas and took two of three games from Texas last weekend -- 
only the second time the Longhorns have lost a series at Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois is led by Bubba Smith, a sophomore pitcher/infielder from Riverside 
who was the Big Ten player of the year last season. Other key players include 
sophomore catcher Sean Mulligan from Diamond Bar, sophomore pitcher/infielder 
Jason Moler from Anaheim and senior shortstop Wil Parsons from El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
The Illini will play UCLA, Cal State Long Beach, Utah, UC Irvine and Cal State 
Fullerton during the weeklong stay. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure there will be some impact and some emotions involved when we play at 
Fullerton," Garrido said. 
</P>
<P>
Card sharks: College baseball fans who missed the USC-Stanford series at 
Dedeaux Field two weeks ago lost out not only on the opportunity to watch what 
were then the No. 1 teams in separate polls, but also on a possible investment. 
</P>
<P>
Three thousand of those in attendance received a set of 12 USC baseball cards 
featuring former Trojan stars such as Tom Seaver, Dave Kingman, Fred Lynn and 
Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a $5 to $10 set right out of the chute," said Kit Kiefer, editor of 
Baseball Cards magazine. "In the long term, and I'm talking about two years, it 
should become a $20 to $25 item, possibly more." 
</P>
<P>
Kiefer said the value of most of the cards will be limited because of their 
regional distribution. However, as Seaver nears induction into the Hall of Fame 
and McGwire's career progresses, the value of their cards will rise. 
</P>
<P>
"People are starting to turn to college cards," Kiefer said. "Right now, 
they're like minor league cards five or seven years ago. It's a burgeoning 
area." 
</P>
<P>
We meet again: USC and UCLA, both ranked among the nation's top 15 teams, 
resume their cross-town rivalry this weekend with a three-game Pacific 10 
Southern Division series. 
</P>
<P>
USC leads the all-time series, 186-79, but the Trojans hold just a 33-27 
advantage over the past 10 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
USC, ranked seventh, is 12-7 overall and 4-4 in the Pac-10. The Trojans were 
swept last weekend at Arizona. UCLA, ranked 14th, is 16-6 overall and 3-5 in 
the Pac-10. The Bruins are coming off a split with California. 
</P>
<P>
In the Southern Division standings, Arizona (5-1) is in first place, followed 
by Stanford (5-3), USC, Cal (2-3), UCLA and Arizona State (2-5). 
</P>
<P>
The Trojan-Bruin series opens Friday night at UCLA, continues Saturday 
afternoon at USC and ends Sunday afternoon at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Flight protection: Arizona State players, in a hurry to make a flight out of 
San Jose Monday, didn't bother to change out of their uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman left-hander Michael Fenton didn't make it through the metal detector, 
and couldn't figure out why until a teammate jokingly suggested the problem 
must be his protective cup. That was it. 
</P>
<P>
"I've worn a steel cup all of my life, and I'm so used to it, I didn't even 
consider it might be the problem," Fenton said. 
</P>
<P>
What price, glory?: Jon Peters, a freshman right-hander at Texas A&amp;M who 
set a national high school record with 53 consecutive victories, underwent 
arthroscopic surgery on his pitching elbow and will be a redshirt this season. 
</P>
<P>
Peters, 19, hurt the elbow during a high school all-star game in the Houston 
Astrodome last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Peters had a 54-1 overall record at Brenham High School, including 22 shutouts 
and five no-hitters, and struck out 612 batters in 370 innings. He broke the 
national record of 51 straight victories on April 29, 1989, beating A&amp;M 
Consolidated. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'll be able to contribute next year," Peters said. "This might be the 
best thing for me in the long run. There was some pressure on me to be able to 
step right in." 
</P>
<P>
College Baseball Notes 
</P>
<P>
Don Barbara and Michael Lujan are batting .412 for Cal State Long Beach, which 
is ranked 13th by Baseball America. . . . Pepperdine pitcher Steve Duda is 4-0 
with a 2.50 earned-run average. Britt Craven is 3-0 with a 3.49 ERA. . . . Cal 
State Fullerton left-hander Huck Flener is 4-0 with a 2.84 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Coach Gary Adams won his 700th college game last week when the Bruins 
defeated Loyola. . . . UCLA catcher Paul Ellis leads the nation with 14 home 
runs and 40 runs batted in. First baseman Chris Pritchett is batting .408.

FEUDING PICKS UP WHERE IT LEFT OFF AS SEASON OPENS 
</P>

<P>
The most contentious and controversial Formula One season in history ended four 
months ago in the rain in Australia, and indications are the 1990 Grand Prix 
season may open with the same rancorous atmosphere Sunday in the sunshine at 
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
The rivalry between Alain Prost, the world champion from France, and Ayrton 
Senna, his chief challenger and former teammate from Brazil, is so bitter that 
a mutual sponsor, Marlboro, has scheduled separate news conferences for them 
today. Normally, when drivers race for the same sponsor, they appear together 
as one big, happy family. 
</P>
<P>
Both drove for McLaren-Honda last year, a circumstance that did little to 
alleviate their hard feelings toward one another. This year, Prost has taken 
his talents to Ferrari in hopes of bringing the Italian factory its first world 
championship since South Africa's Jody Scheckter won in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Prost, 35, won his third world championship last October in Japan while sitting 
on the sideline -- the result of Senna's having crashed into him -- as Senna 
apparently won the race. After the crash, seven laps from the checkered flag, 
Prost was unable to continue, but Senna managed to get his car going and 
returned to the course. In so doing, however, he cut across a curve, causing 
him to be disqualified for taking a shortcut. The decision, which the McLaren 
team threatened to take to court, gave the race to Alessandro Nannini in a 
Benneton Ford and the championship to Prost. 
</P>
<P>
Senna, 29, the 1988 champion, accused Jean-Marie Balestre of France, president 
of the International Motor Sports Federation (FISA), of "manipulating" the 
championship for his countryman. 
</P>
<P>
"Balestre, out of patriotism, friendship or for other reasons I prefer not to 
mention, wanted to see Prost as champion," Senna said. 
</P>
<P>
Balestre responded by suspending Senna for six months, fining him $100,000 and 
threatening to bar him for the entire 1990 season if he did not apologize. 
</P>
<P>
"The possibility exists of (my) abandoning Formula One, and I am still debating 
with myself whether or not I have the motivation to continue racing (in Formula 
One)," Senna said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
McLaren paid the $100,000 fine, and the six-month ban was suspended, but when 
Senna refused to apologize, Balestre set a deadline of Feb. 15 for him to apply 
for a license. As the date approached and no apology was heard from Senna, 
there were rumors that he would make his 1990 debut in Phoenix, all right -- 
but in an Indy car on April 8, instead of in a Formula One car on March 11. 
</P>
<P>
At the last minute, the Brazilian issued an apology of sorts, which apparently 
appeased Balestre enough that he granted him a license. 
</P>
<P>
Prost, on the other hand, said the bitterness of his long struggle with Senna 
prevented him from enjoying the championship and that he was eager to leave 
McLaren for Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Senna) is a computer, he sees only the success," Prost was quoted as 
saying in the East German newspaper, Deutsches Sportecho. "He is risking his 
life just to win and to become world champion. I find this price is too high." 
</P>
<P>
When the Grand Prix season ended one race later, at Adelaide, Australia, Prost 
refused to drive in the rain and sat in the pits while the race was run -- a 
sad footnote to a championship season. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to win the drivers' title again this year, but my main motivation is to 
see Ferrari beat McLaren to win the team title," Prost told Reuters before 
leaving London for Phoenix. "The No. 1 consideration is Ferrari, even if it 
means Nigel (Mansell) winning instead of me." 
</P>
<P>
Mansell, an Englishman who drove last year for Ferrari and had his own share of 
controversy, will be Prost's teammate. 
</P>
<P>
Mansell was disqualified in the Portuguese Grand Prix for driving in reverse in 
the pits and then failing to respond to a black flag calling him in. He was 
fined $50,000 and suspended from the Spanish Grand Prix the following week. 
</P>
<P>
The circumstance took on added significance when Mansell, still racing despite 
being disqualified, collided with Senna and the championship contender was 
knocked out of the race. Mansell claimed he had to go in reverse after 
overshooting his pits because McLaren mechanics and tires blocked his view of 
where to stop, a claim that McLaren team manager Ron Dennis vehemently denied. 
</P>
<P>
Austria's Gerhard Berger, who won the Portuguese race for Ferrari after Senna 
was sidelined, has replaced Prost on the McLaren-Honda team this year in what 
appears to be a straight driver trade between the two leading teams. 
</P>
<P>
When the season opens Sunday with the Iceberg USA Grand Prix in the streets of 
downtown Phoenix, it will be only the second time since 1957, the year before 
Phil Hill and Carroll Shelby left Southern California to drive a pair of 
Maseratis in the French Grand Prix, that there will be no American drivers. 
</P>
<P>
When Eddie Cheever, a native Arizonan who lived most his life overseas, dropped 
out this year to drive an Indy car, it left Formula One exclusively the 
province of drivers from Europe, South America, Australia and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Cheever, who plugged along, competing in 132 races for eight different teams 
without a win through the last decade, was the lone driver wearing Stars and 
Stripes most of that time. Danny Sullivan drove the 1983 season with Tyrrell, 
and Mario Andretti, who won the championship in 1978 in a Lotus Ford, also 
drove in 1981 before dropping off the international circuit. 
</P>
<P>
Cheever missed the 1986 season, which he took off, but returned to drive three 
more years for the Arrows team. This year, he will drive a Penske-Chevrolet for 
Chip Ganassi on the Indy car circuit. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, despite the lack of interest from American teams or drivers, 
there have been more Formula One races in the United States than in any other 
country, although their sites have moved around from Indianapolis to Sebring, 
Fla., to Riverside, to Watkins Glen, N.Y., to Long Beach, to Las Vegas, to 
Detroit, to Dallas and now to Phoenix. That's right, the Indianapolis 500 was 
part of the Formula One season from 1950 through 1960, and those 11 races give 
the U.S. a total of 52, to 42 for Great Britain and 40 for Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The Phoenix race will be the only time a U.S. Grand Prix has opened the season, 
except for 1981 in Long Beach. Last year, the inaugural Phoenix race was held 
in June in 100-degree weather. 
</P>
<P>
POWERBOATS -- Jim Duvall of Long Beach, in Crimson Tide, will defend his 
championship Saturday in the Long Beach Rum Run offshore race against a field 
that includes former winner Bob Nordskog, in Powerboat Magazine Special; Karl 
Koster, in Kal Kustom, and David Perry, in Waterheater. More than 30 boats are 
entered in the race, which will start from Long Beach Harbor and finish in 
front of the Queen Mary. 
</P>
<P>
Larger boats, 30 feet and up, will circle Catalina Island. Smaller boats will 
run to Avalon and return. The Rum Run is the opener of a seven-race Pacific 
Offshore Power Boat Racing Assn. season. Best viewing areas for the 10 a.m. 
start are Bluff Park, along Ocean Blvd. in Long Beach, and Pier J, to the south 
of the Queen Mary. 
</P>
<P>
SPEEDWAY CYCLES -- The third round of the four-event Spring Classic series will 
be held Friday night at the Orange County Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa. British 
League veteran Kelly Moran and national champion Bobby Schwartz swapped wins in 
the first two events. Moran won at Long Beach and Schwartz at San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
Teen-ager Billy Hamill, who will leave Saturday for England to ride in the 
British League, dislocated his knee in the Long Beach race and missed the San 
Bernardino race, but hopes to be ready Friday night in Costa Mesa. Before he 
crashed in the main event, Hamill won four of five heats. The series will end 
March 17 at the Earl Warren Showgrounds in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
SPRINT CARS -- Wingless cars of the California Racing Assn. will compete 
Saturday night at Kings Speedway in Hanford. Billy Vukovich III is expected to 
drive against the CRA regulars, headed by two-time defending champion Ron 
Shuman and fellow Arizonan Lealand McSpadden, who won last Saturday night in 
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
DRAG RACING -- The Nostalgia Drag Racing Assn. will hold its second annual 
March Meet this weekend at Bakersfield Raceway, featuring a grudge match Sunday 
between K.S. Pittman and the Stone-Woods-Cook car that raced against one 
another in the early 1960s. . . . Top Gas West dragsters will race Sunday at 
the Los Angeles County Raceway in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
MOTOCROSS -- The Continental Motosports Club will hold its Western States 
championship Saturday and Sunday at Las Vegas International Raceway.

FIELD OF DREAMS AND LAND OF GOLD; 
</P>
<P>
HISTORY: BY THE MID-1850S THERE WERE 6,000 PROSPECTORS -- MORE THAN THE 
POPULATION OF THE PUEBLO OF LOS ANGELES AT THE TIME -- SCOURING PLACERITA 
CANYON FOR GOLD.

Sometimes it can be good fortune to take a nap after lunch. After Francisco 
Lopez took one in the Santa Clarita Valley's Placerita Canyon one day in 1842, 
he awoke to find gold. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery, on March 9, 1842, is considered by historians to be the first 
major gold strike in California, predating by six years John Marshall's 
Sutter's Mill bonanza on the American River just east of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Most people today know nothing about Placerita Canyon gold. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the strike, "The area was still Spanish land grant property and 
it never really became big with gringos. Sutter's Mill helped make California a 
state," said Valerie Vartanian, supervisor at Placerita State and County Park. 
But Placerita Canyon never received a lot of publicity "and many people back 
east didn't even know about it." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez wasn't prospecting for gold on that March afternoon. He and some friends 
actually had gone to the San Francisquito Rancho -- which encompassed much of 
the Santa Clarita Valley -- to inspect cattle when they stopped to take a break 
in a rolling field under a large oak tree, just east of the present-day 
Antelope Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular version of the story, according to historical journals of the 
time, is that Lopez settled down for a siesta and dreamed of finding gold. When 
he awoke, it was lunchtime, and he decided to spice his food by digging up a 
few wild onions. Clinging to them were flecks of gold. 
</P>
<P>
"How much of it is true, I don't know," Vartanian said. Fact or fable, the gold 
was real and plentiful enough to have the state declare the tree a California 
Historical Landmark on March 6, 1935, and name it "The Oak of the Golden 
Dream." 
</P>
<P>
Another, less romantic version of the Lopez discovery is offered by Curator 
Elva Meline of the San Fernando Valley Historical Society. 
</P>
<P>
She said that according to "Pre-Marshall Gold in California," Vol. II, by Emil 
Bunje and James C. Kean, Lopez's wife asked him to bring back some wild onions 
for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
After inspecting cattle in Los Placeritos Canyon on the San Francisquito Rancho 
with companions Domingo Bermudez and Manuel Cota, Lopez had lunch under a large 
oak tree and took a traditional siesta. Upon awakening, he remembered his 
wife's request and went down a nearby slope to dig for onions. 
</P>
<P>
Elated by his gold find, Lopez and his companions dug up more onions and found 
additional evidence that his first harvest was not just a fluke. The next day, 
they went to the San Fernando Mission to report their find. 
</P>
<P>
According to a journal of the Historical Society of Southern California, Lopez 
and his friends sent samples to the governor in Santa Barbara and immediately 
petitioned him for the mining title. No record has ever been found that the 
title was granted, according to historians, but one chronicle of the time noted 
that the original gold was made into earrings for the governor's wife. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of title didn't stop Lopez from mining the territory. In 1843 he 
imported 30 experienced prospectors from the Mexican state of Sonora to help 
him work the area for "placer gold," so-named because it normally is found in 
quiet or placid areas of running streams. Placerita Canyon, which takes its 
name from the same word, has many such placid streams. 
</P>
<P>
"When mountains erode," said Vartanian, "all of the bits and pieces of rock go 
into the stream and are deposited as sediment. Some of the pieces are gold 
flakes. Gold is fairly heavy and will settle down." 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1850s there were about 6,000 prospectors -- more than the population 
of the pueblo of Los Angeles at the time -- scouring the Santa Clarita Valley 
for gold. A chronicle of the time noted that the canyon became the first 
tourist attraction in Southern California, with out-of-towners regularly making 
the 40-mile trip from the city to the gold fields to watch men recovering an 
average of $2 worth of the precious metal a day. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Lopez was last mentioned in historical documents in 1854, he and 
others had retrieved more than $2 million in gold from the area's streams. 
</P>
<P>
From a historical perspective, Meline said, researchers consider the Placerita 
Canyon gold discovery a "medium-sized" find that was far overshadowed by the 
mammoth Mother Lode at Sutter's Mill. But, she added, Lopez should be given 
proper credit in state history. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not a big find and it is not a large area, so it didn't take very long 
to mine the canyon," she said, "but the Lopez discovery had a direct bearing on 
the economic development of the future state. It brought people into the area." 
</P>
<P>
Placerita Canyon gold was the first native American gold ever coined in the 
United States. A bit more than 18 ounces of Placerita 
</P>
<P>
gold, shipped via the Cape Horn route, arrived at the Philadelphia Mint on July 
8, 1843. The gold was valued at $344.75, or more than $19 per ounce, at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
A family by the name of Walker eventually bought the Placerita Canyon property 
and later deeded it to the state in 1956. Now operated by the county, the 
350-acre park with its Oak of the Golden Dream are off-limits for gold 
prospecting, and violators may be fined. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't go into a park and take the trees and plant them in your back yard, 
and you can't pan for gold," said Frank Hovore, administrator of the park that 
encompasses the original gold discovery site. "Under the mining rules of 1872, 
ownership of the land constitutes a legal claim. That means the state is the 
legal owner. If you come in and take gold off of another's claim, it's called 
claim jumping. You used to get shot for that." 
</P>
<P>
While no one gets shot for gold mining in Placerita Canyon these days, park 
officials say, they still find people occasionally trying to pay off their 
mortgages by illegal panning. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a wildlife sanctuary, which protects everything, including rocks, 
acorns, leaves and gold. It's all considered the same," Vartanian said. 
</P>
<P>
"Hiking is allowed, as is picnicking in restricted areas, but no consumptive or 
abusive types of recreation. No off-road vehicles, bikes or hunting." 
</P>
<P>
Park officials say there is still some gold in the area, but the amount is 
small since the area was so heavily mined for so long. 
</P>
<P>
"In the eight years I've been here," Vartanian said, "I've pulled a lot of 
people out of the canyon, but they've had no gold to show for it."

BABIES: AS MORE PREMATURE INFANTS SURVIVE, THERAPISTS' SKILLS ARE EMPLOYED TO 
TONE AND TEACH TINY MUSCLES, HELPING PREVENT DEVELOPMENT PROBLEMS LATER.

James sucks on a glove. That's a good sign. 
</P>
<P>
Encouraging James' tongue and jaw muscles to suck on a gloved hand is part of 
the treatment from his therapist. He needs a therapist, not as the victim of an 
accident or stroke, but as a baby born 11 weeks too soon. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything we're doing is preventive," said Penny Erickson, James Zazueta's 
occupational therapist at Kaiser Foundation Hospital in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Occupational and physical therapists guide adult patients back into normal 
lives, but as medical advances save younger and sicker babies, specialists' 
attention has expanded to include infants too sick to move or born so 
prematurely that they had no time to fully develop their muscle and nerve 
systems in the womb. 
</P>
<P>
"Their muscle tone tends to be weak, hurting their ability to roll over and sit 
up," Erickson said of her tiny charges. "If they don't develop muscle tone, 
they may later have problems with writing and fine-muscle tasks." 
</P>
<P>
Abnormal muscle tone is the major non-medical, developmental problem for 
babies. At a stage when hands and mouths are their main means of exploring the 
world, infants' neuromuscular development is vital for a normal rate of growth. 
</P>
<P>
James, having lost maturation time in his mother's womb, was born unable to 
suck, bend his knees and grasp with his fingers, all normal tasks for a 
full-term infant. 
</P>
<P>
In the womb, infants first develop the ability to extend their muscles. Later, 
the increasingly cramped quarters of the uterus in the last few weeks of 
gestation force them to flex their muscles and limbs toward the front of their 
bodies. Premature infants who are unable to flex their muscles are born with 
their necks and spines extended back. Without the strength to lift them against 
the force of gravity, their arms and legs lie flat, instead of curling up and 
flailing about as do those of full-term infants. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens to them is absolutely the antithesis of what you would like to 
happen to them," said Erin Keane-Porter, an occupational therapist at AMI 
Medical Center of Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
Preemies and sick infants are evaluated to determine where the occupational or 
physical therapy is needed. Some are stroked -- almost like the adult version 
of a massage -- for about 20 minutes each day. The soothing, stroking motions 
may be repeated on their arms so that they can be helped to move their thumbs 
up to be sucked, one of the ways that babies comfort themselves. Tiny hands 
need stroking by an adult's finger to encourage grasping. Legs might be gently 
flexed. The preemies may be held in positions that facilitate movement of their 
limbs. Rolled blankets may be placed against their backs to encourage curling 
in the fetal position. 
</P>
<P>
The touch and movement stimulates the infant's nerves that in turn message the 
brain. The activity matures the brain and nervous system and helps muscles to 
function properly. As babies use their muscles more, their movements become 
less jerky. Although many preemies do well without this therapy, their mental 
and physical growth may be slower, therapists say. 
</P>
<P>
First used about 15 years ago, the therapy has become more common in hospitals 
partly because technology has saved more premature babies than before. 
</P>
<P>
"Technology has progressed. They're saving more and more infants, younger 
infants and sicker infants," said Ann Hyde, an occupational therapist at 
Glendale Adventist Medical Center. "Those children are at a higher risk with 
development later on." 
</P>
<P>
Not all medical specialists are convinced that skin and muscle stimulation is 
beneficial. Although they are among believers in the treatment, Erickson and 
Hyde said no study has shown conclusively that tactile stimulation works. In 
addition, experts in the field said attributing babies' improvement to such 
therapy alone would be difficult because so many factors have to be considered, 
including the use of machines and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no studies that show it works, but there are no studies to show that 
it doesn't," said Dr. Tom Sherry, director of the neonatal intensive care unit 
at the Kaiser hospital. "There are a lot of things in medicine like that. We'd 
rather do it than find out later we should have. I'm more willing to use it, 
but I'm just as skeptical." 
</P>
<P>
Sherry said some muscletone problems that are resolved by 12 months probably 
would have disappeared without intervention. But he said sick infants, such as 
those with neurological problems, definitely improve with the therapy. 
</P>
<P>
One study by the University of Miami and Duke University medical schools about 
six years ago suggested that babies given the therapy gain weight faster, sleep 
better, are more alert and leave the hospital six days earlier, saving the 
hospital an average of $3,000 per infant. Other studies by medical schools, 
doctors and therapists showed that such stimulation appeared effective, but 
cautioned that more investigation is needed. 
</P>
<P>
Hyde said the therapy really caught on in the last five years. "I get calls all 
the time from other hospitals saying that the neonatal intensive care unit 
wants training for therapists," she said. In the last year, Hyde received calls 
from about 10 hospitals asking for Glendale's training program, which teaches 
therapists how to evaluate babies' reactions to the stimulation. 
</P>
<P>
At Glendale, gentle stimulation is given to about 98% of the babies in the 
intensive care unit, which admits about 200 sick and premature infants each 
year, Hyde said. 
</P>
<P>
In the long run, some care givers said, early intervention therapy saves 
medical costs, such as charges for surgery or equipment to rectify 
developmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson stuck her hands inside James' incubator. That morning, at 33 weeks, 
the baby weighed 3 pounds, 2 ounces, almost a pound more than at birth four 
weeks before. A respirator tube was stuck into his mouth and an intravenous 
tube into his foot. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson flexed James' legs, watching to see if they would recoil, the reaction 
of a full-term infant when its legs are tugged. But although the therapist felt 
the movement of a tiny tendon in James' foot, his legs dropped like lifeless 
objects. 
</P>
<P>
"Real weak, but he's responding much more than two days ago," said Erickson, 
who has helped organize treatment programs at four hospitals since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, James, like many other preemies and sick infants, will probably 
be brought back to therapists for checkups on his balance, motor skills and how 
he solves problems such as fitting together the pieces of a puzzle. 
Developmental problems may take a long time to disappear and treatment is often 
required into young adulthood, therapists say. 
</P>
<P>
Parents like Pamela Jenkins are taught to continue the therapy after the baby 
goes home. Jenkins, who worked with her daughter at home for a year, was at 
first scared of hurting her baby, who was born with neurological problems. "I 
was scared because my child's muscles were so tight. She cried a lot when I did 
the exercises in the beginning. With her not being able to talk, I didn't know 
whether she was hurting." 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins now believes that the therapy saved her from high expenses for 
corrective and medical treatments and from a life of serving a child who was 
unable to care for her own needs. 
</P>
<P>
"From what the doctors were telling me, I thought I had to dedicate my life in 
taking care of her," Jenkins said. "When she was born, I was told if she lasted 
through the night, that was good. The first time I ever saw her, she was hooked 
up to quite a few machines. Her mouth was taped and she had a tube going down 
her stomach. She didn't hardly move at all. She was big in size, eight pounds, 
but she was lifeless to me. 
</P>
<P>
"To see her now -- I still look at the pictures of her when she was at the 
hospital -- you would not believe that she was the same child." 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals encourage parents to start working with premature or ill newborns 
when the babies are still in incubators. 
</P>
<P>
"The parents start focusing on the monitors, watching the numbers and not 
looking at what their baby is doing," Erickson said. "We want them to start 
looking at the baby and at how the baby is responding to them. We want to get 
the parents bonded to the babies, handling them, feeding them, changing their 
diapers. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the parents involved are very receptive to doing any kind of exercise 
or handling. A lot of it is just natural."

Adam Brock doesn't look like a sick child. 
</P>
<P>
He is 10 years old, loves to tackle his younger brothers and shoot baskets out 
front of his Tarzana home. His bedroom is plastered with posters of Bo Jackson, 
Mickey Mantle and John Candy. On his bookshelf are more than a dozen baseball 
and basketball trophies. And a picture of himself with longer hair. 
</P>
<P>
But near his closet are two shelves that look like they belong in a hospital. 
They contain needles, a sterile solution used with intravenous injection 
devices and assorted oral medications. There is an infectious waste container 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
These have become more important to Adam than all his trophies combined. 
</P>
<P>
Adam has leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
Each day, his mother loads a tray with needles and solutions and flushes out 
two lines that were surgically implanted in Adam's chest in December. The lines 
make it easier for doctors to draw blood and administer chemotherapy -- as they 
will again starting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors have given Adam one year to find a bone marrow donor. Otherwise, they 
say his disease will be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
"Not too long ago one year would never have been enough time to find a donor," 
said Dr. Rudi Brutoco, a Covina pediatrician who in September, 1988, started an 
organization called Life-Savers Foundation that recruits marrow donors. "Today 
it is reasonable to think that Adam will find a donor in time." 
</P>
<P>
In less than two years, Life-Savers has organized enough donor drives 
nationwide to increase the number of donors listed with the National Marrow 
Donor Program from 17,000 to nearly 90,000. Brutoco has set a goal of 
increasing the list to 150,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Even with all the people who have been tested and put into the national bank, 
there are still people who don't have a match available," Brutoco said. "And so 
we must keep working on it." 
</P>
<P>
Life-Savers gained national attention recently for helping Anissa Ayala, 17, a 
Walnut teen-ager who has leukemia. Mary Ayala, the girl's 43-year-old mother, 
conceived a child hoping its bone marrow would match Anissa's and that a 
transplant would save the teen's life. Tests sponsored by Life-Savers showed 
that the unborn baby girl's bone marrow does match Anissa's and when the child 
is 6 months old, a transplant probably will be performed. A search is still 
being conducted for a compatible match for Anissa, and if one is found the 
family would not need to use the baby's marrow. 
</P>
<P>
"Children are the best donors of all," Brutoco said. "People have jumped all 
over this because they thought we were going to use the marrow and throw away 
the baby. That's absolutely ridiculous." The plan to use the baby's marrow has 
been criticized for the ethical dilemma it raises in bringing a child into the 
world to save another. 
</P>
<P>
There is a 25% chance that two siblings will share a common bone marrow type, 
but the odds of matching up with a stranger are 20,000 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
The parents of Adam Brock and Dean Schmitt, a 15-year-old Thousand Oaks boy 
with leukemia, have ruled out the possibility of having another child in the 
hopes of finding a bone marrow match. 
</P>
<P>
"But both of them would do it if they could," Brutoco said. "The fact is, they 
really don't have time. Those boys need donors very quickly because their forms 
of leukemia move much swifter than the kind Anissa has." 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, Life-Savers has organized several donor drives for the boys, 
including one for Adam Brock that will take place Sunday from 11:30 a.m. to 
3:30 p.m. at Stratton's Restaurant in Encino. The drive will be held in 
conjunction with a fund-raising brunch that will cost $50 per adult and $15 per 
child under 18. Children age 3 and under are free and all proceeds will go to 
Adam Brock's account with Life-Savers. 
</P>
<P>
Blood tests to scan potential donors cost $75 apiece. Although friends and 
family members have raised more than $60,000 for Adam's donor drives, they have 
used all the money and still have not found a donor, according to Laurie Brock, 
the boy's mother. 
</P>
<P>
"It is sometimes difficult to convince people to be tested because they think 
they're giving a lung or a kidney or something," Brutoco said. "It's not like 
that, but it's our job to educate the public." 
</P>
<P>
During a transplant procedure, 5% of a donor's marrow is taken while the donor 
is under a light anesthesia. Normal activity may resume the next day and the 
donor's marrow replenishes itself within 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
One problem leukemia patients face is the reluctance of some potential donors 
listed with the national bank. Earlier this week, a Seattle woman scheduled to 
donate marrow to Tarzana attorney Marc Smith, 36, changed her mind about 
undergoing the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
"This is always a problem we face," Brutoco said. "People get into the bank 
because they wanted to help a friend or relative and when it turns out that 
they match up with a stranger in another state, they back out." 
</P>
<P>
It was May, 1988, when Brutoco's wife, Diana, was diagnosed with chronic 
myeloid leukemia -- a slow-acting leukemia that is normally fatal within three 
years if a transplant is not performed. Immediately, Diana's brothers were 
tested to see if their marrow matched hers. It did not. And because Diana's 
marrow type was not represented in the National Marrow Donor Program bank, 
doctors told her the disease would likely be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
"So we formed Life-Savers and got together our first donor drive," Brutoco 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Through the couple's efforts, a donor was found and in March, 1989, Diana 
Brutoco received a transplant. Today she has resumed an active life style 
working for the foundation and caring for the couple's four children. Like 
other leukemia transplant patients, Diana has a 70% chance of complete 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still so many people dying needlessly from leukemia because someone 
can't find a donor in time," Brutoco said. "It's especially important for 
children like Adam and Dean. Their leukemia type moves much swifter." 
</P>
<P>
Dean Schmitt had been swimming competitively since he was 5 years old and last 
spring was a valuable member of the Thousand Oaks High School swim team when he 
came down with flu symptoms, said Shirley Schmitt, his mother. When the 
symptoms refused to go away, Schmitt took her son in for tests and doctors 
discovered the leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
Today he is home from school suffering from the side effects of chemotherapy -- 
a bloated face, constant nausea and the loss of his blond hair. 
</P>
<P>
Life-Savers set up a temporary testing laboratory at the Emcon Environmental 
Consultant Firm in Burbank where Dean's father, Ralph, works. More than 150 
employees agreed to be tested and many of them made financial donations matched 
by the firm. 
</P>
<P>
"They are trying to help us save our son," Shirley Schmitt said. "Life-Savers 
has been a big help. We couldn't have done it on our own." 
</P>
<P>
Laurie and Larry Brock feel the same way about the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
"They have helped get the word out and they send licensed technicians to the 
donor drives," Laurie Brock said. "Adam doesn't really understand what is going 
on, but he knows that we're all trying to find him a donor." 
</P>
<P>
Adam said he isn't afraid of leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
But he is afraid of getting a transplant. Prior to receiving donated marrow, a 
leukemia patient must take near-lethal doses of chemotherapy to destroy his own 
infected marrow. If the patient is not in remission, he may not be strong 
enough to survive the transplant. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember once at the hospital when this boy was getting his transplant and 
all of the sudden everyone started running around," Adam said. "The little 
boy's mother was crying and everyone was trying to calm her down. It looked 
kind of scary so now I'm afraid of the transplant. 
</P>
<P>
"But I know it's what I need." 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Brock remembers the incident. The boy receiving the transplant had not 
been strong enough and had died during the operation. 
</P>
<P>
"I still haven't told Adam," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Adam's house is full of activity these days. Donor drives have brought many 
professional athletes and movie stars out to visit him and offer their best 
wishes. Recently, the Clippers basketball organization took him and his mother 
by limousine for a game at the Sports Arena where Adam was an honorary ball 
boy. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the attention, Adam normally doesn't talk about his disease when 
strangers are around, Laurie Brock said. 
</P>
<P>
But recently, when his mother was talking with a visitor about the boy's 
illness, Adam bounded into the house and flopped down on a nearby chair. 
</P>
<P>
"Mom, I just wanted to ask you how come I got leukemia?" he said 
matter-of-factly. "You know, like what did I do wrong that it happened to me?" 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Brock shook her head and forced a smile. "It was nothing you did, honey. 
Now why don't you go back out and play." 
</P>
<P>
Adam thought about it for a moment and then made an announcement. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone should have their bone marrow tested when they're born," he 
said. "That way there would always be a match and no one would have to die from 
leukemia." 
</P>
<P>
With that, he jumped up and ran back outside to shoot more baskets with his 
3-year-old brother, Bobby. 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Brock sighed and stared out the window after Adam. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone tells me his disease is fatal but I just can't believe it," she 
paused a moment and tears filled her eyes. "He doesn't look sick. 
</P>
<P>
"But this is real," she continued. "If we don't find a donor, we could lose 
him." 
</P>

The Art of Shopping 
</P>
<P>
"This is a dangerous place to work. You have to practice willpower," said Vicky 
Lockwood, who volunteers at the Art Gallery Store at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
The store specializes in handmade items from around the world that are priced 
lower than the usual double markup of most museum or retail gift stores. When 
you see how much something costs there, you're apt to think, "Well, that's 
about as much as I'd want to pay," rather than, "Nice, but no thanks." 
</P>
<P>
Better still, the small store is restocked once or twice a week. Jewelry, 
pillows, whimsical hand-painted boxes and toys, vases, candlesticks, cards, 
stamps, T-shirts, art books -- the inventory changes constantly. "Things can go 
pretty fast. I put some comforters in there, and they sold out in three days," 
said Phil Morrison, an art history professor at CSUN who directs the store 
along with CSUN Arts Council volunteers Marge Brown and Jacque Schrogin. 
</P>
<P>
The store space dissolves into gallery space, and there are now three exhibits 
worth seeing: a neon-and-adobe installation, a collection of ancient Greek 
vases and an "industrial architecture" sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
"We're probably better-known in the nation than we are in the Valley," said Ann 
Burroughs, the gallery's exhibit coordinator. "Plus, we're free and you don't 
have to drive over the hill to get here." 
</P>
<P>
Store hours are noon to 4 p.m. Mondays and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesdays through 
Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cocoon-Style Dining 
</P>
<P>
We like to eat out because we don't like to cook -- but we also like to stay 
home. How do you get around this dilemma? Carry-out food. 
</P>
<P>
The California Restaurant Assn. calls take-out food "the fastest growing 
function in our industry." Spokesman Marc DiDomenico said, "It used to be just 
pizza, but now you can get just about anything you want through take-out -- 
like Chinese, barbecue or Continental. Some high-end restaurants are moving 
into carry-out too." 
</P>
<P>
Several upscale restaurants in the San Fernando Valley provide carry-out 
service, but only for their best customers. A more accommodating approach is 
favored by La Serre on Ventura Boulevard in Studio City. Stay-at-home diners 
can carry out a la carte food or a six-course gourmet meal (at $55 per person). 
</P>
<P>
"People come here and pick up everything or sometimes we send over a chef and a 
waiter. It depends on how many people there are," explained chef and co-owner 
Jean-Pierre Peiny. 
</P>
<P>
According to the National Restaurant Assn., fewer than 1% of high-end 
restaurants offer take-out service. 
</P>

Lifesaving Samaritans 
</P>
<P>
If you haven't taken a disaster first-aid class, you better hope that your 
neighbor or co-worker has. 
</P>
<P>
"About 80% of the rescues in major disasters like earthquakes are performed by 
spontaneous volunteers. They're going to do whatever they know how to do and 
will provide the initial medical care," said John Moede, a paramedic with the 
disaster preparedness division of the Los Angeles Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
Moede is also president of Urban Search &amp; Rescue, a nonprofit research 
group based in Canyon Country that consults with government disaster agencies. 
</P>
<P>
In an earthquake, death may result from three types of trauma, according to 
Moede. "First there's instant death from an overwhelming and irreversible 
injury -- like a ton of concrete falling on you," he said. "Then there are the 
people who can last for hours after being hurt, but then die from lack of care. 
The third group may last for weeks or months, but eventually die from secondary 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
Those who are trained in disaster first aid can make a difference in the last 
two instances, Moede contends. "They can make a huge impact on the number of 
people who survive." 
</P>
<P>
Moede will teach a disaster first aid course at the Learning Tree's Chatsworth 
campus March 17. For information, call (818) 882-5599.

Beyond Bingo 
</P>
<P>
When you hear the term "senior citizens center," you tend to picture a long, 
slow bingo game in a crowded room. But what happens in 10 to 30 years when 
today's middle-aged become seniors? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure the next generation likes to play bingo," said Sal Errico, 
recreation director for Los Angeles' Mid-Valley Senior Citizens Center in Van 
Nuys. "Now we have Depression and World War II people coming here. The majority 
of them are middle educated, and most of them are middle income. But I've begun 
thinking about 10 years from now, when the baby boomers become seniors. What 
will they like?" 
</P>
<P>
Errico has already been offering seniors some beefier-than-bingo courses. He 
teaches a class called "Controversies and the Human Condition." Its oldest 
member is 90; the youngest is in his mid-50s. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a free-wheeling, wide-ranging discussion group covering philosophy, 
history, world affairs and ideas that influence our world today," Errico said. 
"Philosophy is my passion." 
</P>
<P>
Although bingo remains a popular pastime at most senior citizens centers, it's 
just one of many programs and activities offered at low or no cost. 
</P>
<P>
Among the services provided by the three adult centers in Burbank are support 
group meetings, day trips, health screenings and showings of old movies. 
Classes cover crafts, languages, exercises, games, health, art, music and 
dancing. Lectures may cover such topics as income tax or new medical 
treatments. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll find almost everything going on at senior centers now because the life 
span is longer today," Errico said. "Growing older doesn't mean you become a 
museum piece."

HEALTH: WORKERS ARE GOING DOOR-TO-DOOR TO REACH OUT TO ELDERLY CAMBODIANS. 
LANGUAGE AND CULTURAL BARRIERS HAVE LEFT SOUTHEAST ASIAN REFUGEES WARY OF

<P>
Nem Norn is almost always tired. A refugee from Cambodia, Nem, 53, saw two of 
his children killed by the communist Khmer Rouge before he fled to the United 
States five years ago. Today he shares a small apartment in Long Beach with his 
wife and four surviving children where, suspecting that his constant state of 
exhaustion stems from the longstanding depression of his past, he struggles 
through his days with little help. 
</P>
<P>
Yoth Yoeung, 45, has a lump in her throat. Once she went to a doctor, but the 
doctor could not speak her language. So Yoeung, also a Cambodian refugee, does 
the best she can without much comprehension. "I never understand what the 
doctor says," she explained through an interpreter who recently visited her 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
That interpreter was part of a new program that already has served about 350 
elderly Southeast Asians in Long Beach, either by luring them to health 
education classes or by providing translators for their appointments with 
doctors. Sponsored by St. Mary Medical Center and United Cambodian Community 
Inc., its aim is to reach Southeast Asians 45 and older, particularly Cambodian 
refugees, whose language barriers, cultural values, fear or general alienation 
often prevent them from seeking or using much-needed medical care. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an uphill battle," said Lillian Lew, project director, "but I'm sure that 
we can make an impact on this community." 
</P>
<P>
In the seven months since the program began, she said, it has sent teams of 
bilingual health workers door-to-door in central-city apartment complexes known 
to be inhabited by large numbers of Southeast Asians. The teams also have been 
stationed at a local Cambodian Buddhist temple where many elderly Cambodians 
spend much of their time. 
</P>
<P>
The service is delivered in two basic ways, Lew said. First, health workers 
introduce themselves, distribute leaflets bearing the program's telephone 
number and interview people regarding the general state of their health. And 
second, she said, they organize "health fairs" at the temple or in the 
apartment complexes to provide health education and such basic health-care 
screening as blood pressure checks, diabetes tests and vision exams. 
</P>
<P>
When health problems are discovered, Lew said, project workers make 
appointments for the refugees with doctors of their choice or at St. Mary. If 
necessary, she said, they even provide transportation to the doctor's office 
and may act as interpreters during the appointments. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Lew said, she hopes to expand the program into Asian markets where 
health workers will give lectures on nutrition and provide demonstrations on 
healthful methods of cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Diet is a key reason for the program, according to Lew, a Chinese-American who 
is a registered dietitian with degrees in sociology and cross-cultural 
education. Among other things, she said, traditional Southeast Asian culture 
encourages the consumption of fatty meats, which contributes to a high 
incidence of strokes and cardiovascular disease; pickled or fermented foods, 
which doctors suspect of causing stomach cancer, and foods high in sodium, 
which contributes to hypertension. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the refugees' general health problems were made worse by their 
experiences under Pol Pot, when food was scarce, and by life in refugee camps, 
where conditions were primitive. 
</P>
<P>
Although no data exists on the health status of Southeast Asian refugees, Lew 
said, they seem to suffer from high rates of hepatitis B, perhaps caused by 
unsanitary living conditions; malnutrition, which is probably a result of the 
war years, and diabetes, which may be diet or stress-related. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, she said, many older Cambodians suffer from serious mental health 
problems, resulting both from the trauma of their past experiences and their 
current difficulties in adapting to a new culture. 
</P>
<P>
One of the goals of the new health project, Lew said, is to collect some of the 
missing data on the health needs of older Southeast Asians. The task is 
difficult because they are wary, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Southeast Asians have a different world health view," Lew said. "They have 
their own underground health culture." 
</P>
<P>
Among the features of that culture is the perception of a hospital as a place 
one goes only to die. Having come from a society in which medical techniques 
are an average of 30 years behind those in the United States, Lew said, many 
refugees utilize herbal cures, spiritual healing or over-the-counter medicines 
rather than seek the advice of trained physicians. 
</P>
<P>
It was to help provide alternatives to those practices that the FHP Foundation 
-- a Long Beach-based organization dedicated to supporting health-care 
education, research and services -- recently awarded a $140,000 grant to the 
Southeast Asian Health Project that runs the new program. The money is being 
used, Lew said, for printed materials, health fair personnel, and to pay the 
salaries of the teams of bilingual health workers. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the refugees encountered during a recent visit to their apartment 
complex seemed to appreciate the personal attention. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy if someone comes to knock at my door," said Lach Kheng, 57, 
who, speaking through the interpreter, had complained of "hot" feeings inside 
his stomach. "It's a help. I don't know where to go or what to do. At least now 
I can discuss it."

ALTERNATIVE CAMPUS SITES TO BE STUDIED; 
</P>
<P>
TAYLOR RANCH: FEARING A LAWSUIT, CAL STATE UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS BACK AWAY FROM 
THEIR REFUSAL TO CONSIDER ANY OTHER COUNTY LOCATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Backing away from an ultimatum identifying Taylor Ranch outside Ventura as the 
only acceptable site for a new Cal State University campus in the county, 
university officials have expressed an "honest interest" in alternative 
locations to the controversial hillside property. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in Ventura last week, state university trustees voted to authorize 
a new environmental impact report on the Taylor Ranch site that will likely be 
the most extensive study undertaken to date by Cal State, university officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Once ordered, the report will take a year to complete, officials believe, with 
construction of a campus still four years away. 
</P>
<P>
The detailed discussion of alternative sites and their environmental impacts is 
needed, officials say, to withstand possible legal challenges from opposition 
groups and objections from residents. 
</P>
<P>
But officials contend that their new-found intention to consider alternative 
sites does not contradict the university's position stated late last year. 
Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds said then that without public support for a 
university at Taylor Ranch, Cal State would take its resources to a county that 
does want a university. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see the position as being incompatible," said David Leveille, director 
of institutional relations for Cal State. "It's a requirement of the California 
Environmental Quality Act we were familiar with that we must look at 
alternative sites." 
</P>
<P>
The law, which requires a study of how a new development will affect air 
quality, traffic, water and other resources, also requires the university to 
evaluate whether other locations would have fewer environmental consequences. 
</P>
<P>
"I suspect that this environmental impact report will be different from other 
EIRs by Cal State," said Vice Chancellor John M. Smart. "We will look more 
closely at alternative sites. There is an honest interest in alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
But Smart said the trustees stand firm in their preference for Taylor Ranch, a 
now unproductive spread of hillside farmland that boasts a commanding view of 
the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
"The trustees' interest is in Taylor Ranch and we must keep that in mind," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Progress toward building a university in Ventura County was temporarily halted 
last November after the Environmental Coalition of Ventura County successfully 
argued that the first environmental study was inadequate because it considered 
only the impact of a two-year campus with 2,000 full-time students. 
</P>
<P>
The two-year campus for upper-division students will grow over 30 years into a 
campus large enough for 12,000 to 15,000 students, according to university 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Coalition based its case on a precedent set in a Bay Area 
court decision that cited the California Environmental Quality Act. 
</P>
<P>
A similar interpretation of the same law could open Cal State to challenges on 
the Taylor Ranch study, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1988 suit of Citizens of Goleta Valley vs. the Board of Supervisors, the 
Court of Appeal found that alternative locations for a proposed 400-room Hyatt 
hotel had to be completely analyzed. Giving hotel opponents further latitude, 
the court set no geographical boundaries within which alternatives had to be 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
Consultant W. Keith Julian, vice president of environmental planning for 
Woodward-Clyde Consultants of Santa Barbara, one of three firms being 
considered to conduct the Taylor Ranch study, called the decision 
"revolutionary." 
</P>
<P>
"Do they have to go to Outer Mongolia for alternatives?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Court challenges are only one possible hurdle left for Cal State. The Local 
Agency Formation Commission and the city of Ventura must agree to annex the 
Taylor Ranch site to the city in order for the university to build there, 
university officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council's ad hoc committee on the university this week asked the 
council to set up a group to evaluate alternative sites on its own. The 
council, which did not act on the motion, will reconsider it Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental impact study also will have to establish the state university 
system's ability to guarantee an adequate water supply at a time when Ventura 
city residents are being told to cut water use by one-third. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, despite the fact that travel might be saved by some of an 
estimated 6,000 students who commute from Ventura County to colleges elsewhere, 
the report will have to consider the effects of additional air pollution from 
the estimated 15,000 students who would attend the campus at build-out in 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The county has an air pollution problem which would be exacerbated by a new 
university, said Russ Baggerly of the Environmental Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
"Health should not be sacrificed for those values of higher education, if the 
health effects can be mitigated somewhere else," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental study must also evaluate the geology of the Taylor Ranch, 
which has fault lines meandering through the property, as well as the 
archeological value of Chumash burial grounds or artifacts found on the 
property.

PROPOSED HAWAIIAN GARDENS MOTEL A HOT ELECTION ISSUE 
</P>

<P>
A proposed 57-unit motel -- pilloried as a potential drug den and house of 
prostitution by its opponents -- has become the hottest issue in the April 10 
City Council election, with the two incumbents taking opposite sides. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Kathleen Navejas is supporting the motel -- which would be the 
first in the city. Mayor Donald Schultze is vowing to stop it. "I don't know 
how . . . but I'm going to do it. Believe me, I will find a way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We just got rid of the adult bookstores," said council candidate Joe Cabrera 
Zermeno, "so why are we going to have a hot sheet business?" 
</P>
<P>
Cabrera, a public safety commissioner and one of four challengers seeking two 
seats on the five-member council, said that if the council won't block the 
proposed motel at Carson Street and Belshire Avenue, he will organize a 
campaign against a June ballot measure tied to the proposed motel. 
</P>
<P>
The council placed a referendum on the June ballot that asks voters to approve 
an occupancy tax of up to 10% that, according to motel supporters, could 
generate $60,000 annually for the city treasury. There would also be property 
taxes and sales tax revenue from the banquet and meeting hall that is to be 
built as part of the motel development, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"If that's the only way to circumvent the council's decision," said Cabrera, a 
free-lance artist, "then I'm opposed to (the tax)." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Macias, one of several condominium owners who live near the proposed motel 
site, said: "I think it will definitely draw negative activity in this area, 
like drugs, prostitution, drinking. There are already three bars in the area." 
</P>
<P>
Another motel opponent, condominium owner Jan LaPointe, said: "This town needs 
something that is going to bring in money and jobs and positive growth and this 
motel is just not going to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Cabrera and other opponents of the motel said residents were relieved when the 
city got rid of the adult bookstore, which had been a source of complaints for 
years. The city bought out the business and put the land into the redevelopment 
area. The motel, opponents say, threatens to draw a troublesome clientele just 
as the bookstore did. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Navejas said she would withdraw her support of the project if 
voters reject the proposed occupancy tax. She and Schultze agree on that issue. 
"If the motel goes on without the tax," Schultze said, "we would look kind of 
foolish." 
</P>
<P>
Schultze, however, wants to see the motel parcel combined with others in the 
area to attract a larger commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
Former Councilman Richard Vineyard, who was defeated for reelection in 1988 and 
is trying to make a comeback, agrees with Schultze. "We have very little 
commercial property left. If we keep cutting up little properties . . . we're 
going to end up with little strip centers and motels," Vineyard said. 
</P>
<P>
Another candidate, Grant E. Winford, said: "I don't think we've been shown that 
(a motel) is going to make money for the city." There are a handful of other 
motels within a mile, he said. "They do not draw enough business to keep them 
full." 
</P>
<P>
The only other candidate supporting the motel is Domenic Ruggeri, a political 
ally of Navejas. "It would beautify the city," he said. "That's a bad-looking 
corner." 
</P>
<P>
Navejas argues that the motel would generate jobs and revenue. Suggestions that 
it would lure drug dealers, transients and prostitution, she says, are unfair 
and unfounded. Potential guests at the motel, she says, are business people, 
visitors who have relatives in town, and people with relatives in the nearby 
Long Beach Naval Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Rates at the motel are expected to be about $45 a night, slightly higher than 
other motels in the area, Navejas said. She said the motel would attract a 
respectable clientele at those rates. 
</P>
<P>
A $3-million construction project, the motel would be built in an area in which 
the city's redevelopment agency owns several parcels of land. One parcel has 
already been sold to the Home Club, a regional chain that sells building and 
home-improvement supplies. The one-acre parcel that the agency would sell to 
the motel developers is adjacent to the Home Club site. 
</P>
<P>
The motel developer is El Camino Real Development Co., whose principal partners 
are James V. Wilson of Rolling Hills Realty in Rolling Hills Estates and 
Malcohn Kao of MK Development in South Pasadena. They have built motels in 
South Gate and in Maywood, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be one of the nicest buildings we have," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
He said all motel owners have to deal with the possibility of attracting 
transients and prostitutes. But the motel will be prepared to stop them, he 
said. "We run a really tight ship at our motels and inns and . . . the 
management will keep an eye on this kind of thing. We have a 24-hour video 
security system," Wilson said, adding that the owners have a vested interest in 
protecting their investment. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. Robert Mirabella said motels are not 
automatically an undesirable business. "There's no particular construction 
project -- hotel, motel, apartment or whatever -- that you can make a blanket 
statement about," said Mirabella, administrative officer at the Lakewood 
Sheriff's Station. Hawaiian Gardens contracts with the county for police 
services. 
</P>
<P>
A motel that rents rooms by the hour or advertises X-rated video movies, he 
said, could become a troublesome business. But not all motels operate that way, 
he said. "It would be premature to make an assessment that a place was going to 
cause a problem," Mirabella said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the council voted 3 to 1 to approve a conditional use permit for the 
motel, which means the land has been approved for motel use with certain 
conditions. Navejas, Lennie Wagner and Venn Furgeson voted in favor; Schultze 
voted against. Rosalie Sher, the fifth council member, was absent. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal still must clear two hurdles -- an agreement between the city and 
developers on the price of the land, and council approval of a variance to 
solve a parking problem. The plans, so far, call for only 58 parking spaces, 
which city officials say is inadequate. Wilson says he is negotiating with 
nearby property owners to provide more parking spaces. The parking variance 
will be discussed at the March 27 council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The city and the developers still are negotiating on price. "The (development 
agreement) is not going to be signed until after the June 10 vote because the 
city needs to get the (occupancy) tax," Navejas said.

PARCEL THAT INCLUDES 39 RESIDENCES CHOSEN AS SITE FOR NEW SCHOOL 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A three-acre site that includes 39 residences west of Salt Lake Avenue 
Municipal Park has been chosen as the best location for a new elementary school 
to relieve overcrowded conditions at schools in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Board of Education voted Monday to study the environmental 
impact the school would have on the area. A relocation plan for the residents 
who would be displaced will be developed as well. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental study is expected to take up to nine months. After that, the 
Board of Education will decide whether to build the school on the site, said 
Rodger Friermuth, facilities project manager. 
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of the board action, residents whose homes and apartments would 
be razed have begun circulating petitions calling for the school to be built 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"We like this neighborhood," said Maria Delgado, who, with her brothers and 
sisters, owns a house and four apartments on Newell Street within the proposed 
school site. "The reason we bought this house is because it's next to the 
park." 
</P>
<P>
If all goes as planned, the school could open in three to five years, Friermuth 
said. It would be built in the area between Florence and Saturn avenues, and 
between the east side of Newell Street and the park. It would accommodate about 
1,000 students on a year-round schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The site was selected over three others because it is less expensive, and fewer 
residences and businesses would have to be displaced, Friermuth said. "It takes 
the least amount of property," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to a school district report, two single-family houses, 37 apartments, 
a radiator shop, two offices and a beauty shop would have to be purchased by 
the district and razed. The district, which has condemnation powers, would be 
required to pay fair-market value for the properties. 
</P>
<P>
The district has estimated the cost of purchasing the properties and relocating 
residents and businesses at $3.8 million. The projected costs for the other 
three sites range between $6.6 million and $13.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
A proposed site in Bell would involve fewer residences -- 20. But nine 
businesses would have to be bought out and moved. The total cost would be $11.6 
million, according to a district report. 
</P>
<P>
The Newell Street site would be relatively inexpensive because the school 
district is seeking an agreement with Huntington Park to use a portion of Salt 
Lake Avenue Municipal Park for the school's playground. If the city agrees to 
the arrangement as expected, the school could be built on three acres instead 
of the five acres usually required for an elementary school and its playground, 
Friermuth said. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Park City Council, which must approve such a joint-use 
agreement, has been meeting with school officials. The city would benefit from 
improvements, including new playground equipment, that the school district is 
expected to add to the park, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt it probably is the best site because they will displace less people," 
Mayor William P. Cunningham said. "We think it could be a plus for us also 
because they're talking about putting some real bucks (into the park)." 
</P>
<P>
Delgado said residents also object to a portion of the park being used for a 
school playground. She said it would cut back the number of hours the entire 
park is available to residents of Huntington Park and surrounding cities. 
</P>
<P>
The new elementary school probably will be used to relieve overcrowded 
conditions at Miles Avenue Elementary School in Huntington Park and at State 
Street Elementary School in neighboring South Gate, Friermuth said. 
</P>
<P>
Both schools operate year-round and have been at capacity for several years. 
About 100 students who would otherwise attend Miles Avenue Elementary are bused 
to other schools in the district, a school spokeswoman said. Ninety-one 
students are bused from State Street Elementary to other schools because of 
overcrowding.

CALIFORNIA HEIGHTS GIVEN HISTORIC DISTRICT STATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California Heights, a 1920s-era neighborhood of Long Beach dominated by classic 
Spanish houses and California bungalows, has been designated a historic 
district by the city's Cultural Heritage Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The status helps protect the neighborhood from extensive remodeling, making 
major renovations subject to the approval of the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Demolition could be delayed for up to one year, although it ultimately cannot 
be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood was developed in the 1920s during a burst of economic growth 
in the city. It was built of predominantly Spanish Colonial Revival homes mixed 
with English Tudors. California bungalow-style houses were moved into the area 
from other neighborhoods undergoing substantial redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . The neighborhood has an unusual coherence and period charm," the 
commission said in its decision. 
</P>
<P>
The boundaries of the new historic district are Walnut Avenue, Bixby Road, 
Wardlow Road and the alley east of Atlantic Avenue.

SISTER CITY GROUP EXHIBITS PHOTOS FROM RUSSIA, SIBERIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russian and Siberian photographers are exhibiting their works in the downtown 
library -- a result of the controversial sister city program Long Beach 
established with the Soviet Union in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Jewish leaders urged the City Council against establishing a 
sister city program with Sochi, a resort town on the Black Sea. 
</P>
<P>
The council appeased most of the Jewish leaders by stipulating that human 
rights issues, including free emigration, would be "on top of the agenda" in 
meetings and discussions with Sochi residents. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the cultural, education and trade exchanges that mark sister city 
programs, about 35 photographs will be on exhibit through April 30 at the main 
library, 101 Pacific Ave. Many of the photographs convey scenes of daily life 
in Siberia. Others are self-expressive art pieces, according to the sponsors, 
the Long Beach-Sochi Sister City Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The photographs include the works of Andrey Pashis, a respected Siberian 
photographer. Pashis has won laureate awards in European photographic 
competitions and the 1989 silver medal in photography at the Exhibition of 
Economic Achievement in Moscow, according to the sponsors.

SIMI VALLEY SCHOOL BOARD OKS MORE PERSONNEL CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Simi Valley Board of Education, which recently voted to lay off 32 
temporary teachers in light of a projected $8-million budget deficit next year, 
has decided to make additional personnel cuts. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted late Tuesday night to lay off 28 clerical and service 
employees, which includes some junior high librarians and elementary school 
nurses. 
</P>
<P>
The layoffs will become effective July 1. 
</P>
<P>
The layoffs, coupled with administrative reassignments and other cost-cutting 
measures, are expected to save the district enough money to balance its budget 
as mandated by state law, Supt. John Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel the actions that the board has taken at its last two meetings have 
been sufficient to get us through next year and to meet all of our 
obligations," Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the board voted to lay off 32 temporary teachers and to reassign 34 
assistant principals, psychologists and other administrators to lower-level 
positions with reduced salaries. 
</P>
<P>
The board also approved a freeze on hiring, purchases and travel expenses and 
will eliminate districtwide overtime by 50% in the current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Declining enrollment, limited state funding and a 3% cost-of-living raise for 
teachers are blamed for the anticipated $8-million shortfall, district 
officials said.

BIG WEST TOURNAMENT HOLDS KEY TO 49ERS' NCAA BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This could be the biggest week for men's basketball at Cal State Long Beach in 
13 years. That is how long it has been since the 49ers made it to the NCAA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, who have a 20-7 won-loss record, would appear to have a chance to 
make the 64-team tournament if they do well in the Big West Conference 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
They play Utah State at 4 p.m. Friday in the Long Beach Arena. The 49ers have 
defeated Utah State twice during the regular season, 79-78 and 82-74. 
</P>
<P>
If they win again, they would likely play top-seeded New Mexico State in the 
semifinals at 7 p.m. Saturday. That game could attract a crowd of more than 
10,000. Only twice -- in 1973 and 1979 -- have 49er teams played before crowds 
that big in the arena. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of reasons why we would be a good pick (for the NCAA 
tournament) right now," Long Beach Coach Joe Harrington said. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers have won seven consecutive games. They have an 8-1 nonconference 
record that includes victories over 10th-ranked Purdue and highly regarded 
Texas. They also have defeated 23rd-ranked New Mexico State. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a strong enough team to get in," Harrington said. "We've 
played a strong enough schedule. I think we deserve it." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty victories, however, never guarantee an NCAA berth -- 18 teams that won 
20 or more games last season were not selected. 
</P>
<P>
The University of Nevada-Las Vegas (26-5) and New Mexico State (25-3), who tied 
for first place in the Big West with 16-2 conference records, will certainly be 
selected, and third-place UC Santa Barbara (20-7, 13-5), which defeated 
fourth-place Long Beach twice, is also a strong possibility. 
</P>
<P>
But Las Vegas Coach Jerry Tarkanian said he did not think four teams from the 
Big West Conference would be selected. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt whether there are 64 teams in the country better than Long Beach," 
Tarkanian said. "I don't think they give our league the credit it deserves." 
</P>
<P>
The only sure way for the 49ers, who are 11-0 in games that have been decided 
by six or fewer points, to get into the tournament is by winning the Big West 
tournament. The winner automatically qualifies. 
</P>
<P>
"This team is just now doing the things that the team (17-12) I had the first 
year here did, such as making the extra pass to get the good shot," Harrington 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Harrington, who has been obsessed most of the season with the NCAA tournament 
possibility, said he will be satisfied even if the 49ers don't get in. If they 
don't, it is likely they would go to the National Invitational Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider the season a success right now," Harrington said. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a look at how the 49er players have performed this season: 
</P>
<P>
Tyrone Mitchell: The senior point guard has won praise from coaches, including 
Indiana's Bobby Knight and University of the Pacific's Bob Thomason. "I don't 
see how they will replace him (next season)," Thomason said. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, who likes to drive down the right side of the foul lane, has averaged 
32 minutes, 10 points, 5.5 assists and 4.7 rebounds a game. He also is the 
team's best defensive player. 
</P>
<P>
He is not a threat to shoot from outside and has been unable to master free 
throws (50%). Yet he made two in the final seconds to defeat San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
Lucious Harris: The best freshman in the Big West, he leads the 49ers in 
scoring with a 13-point average. He has scored in double figures 21 times and 
has scored his career high of 18 five times. 
</P>
<P>
Harris got the 49ers started toward a big season when he made a steal in the 
last seconds that led to a layup by Kenny Jarvis to defeat Purdue early in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
Athletic talent enables Harris to make what coaches call big-time moves, but he 
sometimes misses easy baskets at the end of those moves. He has shot only 40% 
from the field. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Cutler: The 6-foot-8 forward/center had a slump midway through the season 
but has come on strong in the last few weeks, including a 28-point, 14-rebound 
performance against San Jose State. He stuffed himself with candy before that 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Cutler, the most intimidating 49er, is the team's leading rebounder with about 
seven a game and leads in blocked shots with 32. He likes to charge to the 
basket to tip in a teammate's shot. He has a tendency to miss easy shots but 
has been in a groove lately at the free throw line. 
</P>
<P>
Troy Joseph: He was in a horrible slump for a long time, but also has 
recovered. His game is driving to the basket for dunks. He did a great 
defensive job against Cal State Fullerton star Cedric Ceballos. Joseph is one 
of many poor free-throw shooters (61%) on a team that has shot 63% from the 
line. 
</P>
<P>
Rudy Harvey: The senior forward started the season as a reserve but became a 
starter seven games ago, and the 49ers have not lost since. Harvey, who is 
shooting 64% from the field, made a 360-degree dunk to spark a recent victory 
over San Jose State. He can be counted on to get a big rebound. 
</P>
<P>
Frankie Edwards: Playing his first year of college basketball, Edwards has 
steadily improved after a shaky start. He has come off the bench recently to 
make big contributions. 
</P>
<P>
His strength makes him a fierce rebounder -- he averages four rebounds despite 
playing only 16 minutes a game. He likes to shoot a base line hook, but rarely 
even hits the rim with it. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Masucci: He scored 76 points during one five-game stretch, but in the last 
eight games has lost his starting job and has averaged only six points. He made 
four turnovers in 10 minutes last week against Fresno State. He and Edwards are 
the only 49ers shooting better than 70% from the foul line. A free spirit, he 
plays with a grin on his face that opposing fans interpret as a smirk. 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Jarvis: He is shooting only 38% from the field and has missed the last 
two games because of an ankle injury. He has had his moments, though, scoring 
in double figures eight times. He had 18 points against Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Darrell Faulkner: A senior guard whose specialty is three-point shooting, 
Faulkner has been one of several key reserves. Last week at Fresno he made 
three shots from long range and also converted his own steal into a layup to 
ignite a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Ronnie Winbush: A 6-foot-8 sophomore who likes to shoot three-pointers, Winbush 
has overcome the jitters that plagued him early in the season. He scored 14 
points recently against Utah State. He has made all 10 of his free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Sears: Mitchell's backup most of the season, he is averaging 11 minutes 
and three points a game. He sometimes loses the ball when pressed. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Williams: He has played only six minutes a game, but rarely plays in big 
games. He scored 13 points against Hofstra. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

HART TO RUN FOR 3RD SENATE TERM; MAY TRY FOR HOUSE IN '92 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) announced Monday that he will run for 
a third term but kept open the possibility he may run for Congress in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
In a press release, Hart said "the next four years will be a particularly 
important time to serve in the state Legislature" because Republican Gov. 
George Deukmejian is leaving office. 
</P>
<P>
But Hart, who is expected to easily beat Republican neophyte Carey Rogers in 
the November election, may run for Congress in 1992, said his campaign 
coordinator, Nels Henderson. Hart would still retain his Senate seat if he lost 
his congressional bid. 
</P>
<P>
"Running for Congress is being considered, but it's not a foregone conclusion," 
Henderson said. "There's still a lot he wants to do, like expand the bottle 
bill to include recycling orange juice bottles and other plastics and 
glassware." 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Hart came within 4,000 votes of unseating veteran Rep. Robert J. 
Lagomarsino (R-Ventura) in the nation's second-costliest race, with the two 
sides spending a total of about $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Late last year, Hart announced that he would not seek a rematch against the 
popular incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Hart will refrain from deciding whether to run for Congress until 
after the governor and state Legislature redraw congressional districts 
following the 1990 Census, said a close Democratic ally who asked not to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
California is expected to gain four to six seats, and the configuration of the 
18th Congressional District represented by Lagomarsino may change 
significantly. 
</P>
<P>
Hart's only opponent in the state Senate election is Rogers, 49, a Goleta bank 
executive and the mother of two children. She has never held public office. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Rogers said Hart, who chairs the Senate Education Committee and 
is a former teacher educated at Stanford and Harvard, lacks practical 
experience outside of government. 
</P>
<P>
The 19th Senate District extends from Santa Barbara through Ventura, Oxnard and 
Port Hueneme to Topanga and part of Woodland Hills.

ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: ALL-AMERICAN TARVER LEADS PARADE AGAIN AS SANTA CLARA 
MARCHES ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was the equivalent of a first-round knockout. Any fan who arrived late need 
not have bothered paying admission. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes into the Southern Section 2-AA Division basketball final at the L. A. 
Sports Arena on Saturday, Santa Clara High held a 12-2 lead over Verbum Dei. 
</P>
<P>
The score was 16-2 after the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
For Shon Tarver, Santa Clara's 6-foot-5 senior guard, Verbum Dei was just 
another team with which to toy. With seemingly no effort, Tarver scored on 
layups, slam dunks, three-point shots and free throws. 
</P>
<P>
At halftime, Santa Clara led, 38-18, and Tarver had outpointed Verbum Dei, 
22-18. 
</P>
<P>
Has there ever been a more one-sided Southern Section final? Has a single 
player ever dominated so completely? 
</P>
<P>
The final score was 76-48. Every Santa Clara player saw action. Tarver, a 
Parade Magazine third-team All-American, left the game with 5 minutes 47 
seconds to play. He had 31 points, 12 rebounds, four blocks and three assists. 
</P>
<P>
Tarver dashed to the bench and gave Coach Lou Cvijanovich his best two-handed 
slam on the palms. Santa Clara's 11th Southern Section basketball title was 
well in hand. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an easier game than I expected," Cvijanovich said. 
</P>
<P>
With Tarver at his finest, there was never any doubt. STEVE HENSON

VENTURA HIGH GIRLS REMAIN ALIVE IN STATE REGIONAL TOURNAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura High girls' basketball team will take on Muir for the second time 
in less than a week Thursday night in the semifinals of the Southern California 
Regional Division II tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Muir defeated Ventura, 56-49, Friday for the Southern Section 4-AA Division 
championship. The Mustangs received an automatic berth in the regionals, while 
the Cougars were an at-large selection. 
</P>
<P>
In the first round of the regionals Tuesday, Ventura (20-10) defeated 
Bakersfield North, 47-42, and Muir (27-5) routed Escondido San Pasual, 56-39. 
</P>
<P>
The regional championship will be Saturday, and winners advance to the State 
tournament next weekend in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't get off to a good start the last time we played Muir," Ventura Coach 
Glenn Gray said, referring to his team's 18-10 first-period deficit. "We got 
close to them a couple of times, but we just we're never able to catch up. 
We'll have to start much faster this time. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the girls are very excited at a second chance. They know they have 
something to prove to themselves. They believe they can win." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura is a younger team than Muir with four underclass players in the 
starting lineup. Muir starts all seniors. 
</P>
<P>
In the 4-AA championship loss, Ventura junior Cori Herman scored a game-high 26 
points but sat out most of the first half with three personal fouls. Muir 
senior guard Rose Jone connected on four three-pointers to lead the Mustangs 
with 24 points and five assists. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura balanced things out against Bakersfield North as sophomore forward 
Denise Rea led the team with 14 points and junior guard Andrew Williams added 
nine. Herman had five points. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a young team and you never know what to expect," Gray said. "Maybe the 
experience from the last Muir game will help us out the second time around. I'm 
sure hoping it does." 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, the Buena girls capped a productive season on a disappointing note. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs entered last Friday's Southern Section 5-A championship game 
against Hart with a 26-0 record, but were beaten 49-45. 
</P>
<P>
Buena received an at-large berth in the Division I regional tournament, but 
lost to top-seeded Morningside, 56-49, Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside, the defending state champion, led by only four points, 45-41, 
heading into the final period but outscored Buena 11-8 to pull out the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Junior guard Mia Palkie scored a team-high 15 points in a losing cause.

FAMILY LIFE: DEPENDING TOTALLY ON AN 11-YEAR-OLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE SPENCER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Out of necessity, most single parents live a pretty structured life, sans much 
margin for error. 
</P>
<P>
Only schedules are more important than budgets -- work schedules, school 
schedules, baby-sitting schedules, dentist appointments, housecleaning, meals, 
all fitted together like a giant jigsaw puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
And, like a puzzle, one missing piece -- such as a kid coming down with the flu 
-- and the whole agenda is trashed. 
</P>
<P>
Childhood illness is the bane of every single parent, another of God's little 
reminders (like earthquakes) that we're not as much in charge as we've led 
ourselves to believe. 
</P>
<P>
But, as I've discovered this past week, there is one thing more disruptive, and 
that's when the parent becomes incapacitated. 
</P>
<P>
I had some wrist surgery (scratch the word surgery; the hospitals now insist it 
is a "procedure"), and my household has been skewed good and proper. 
</P>
<P>
The experience has left me gazing almost wistfully at the sides of milk 
containers, much as I do at the "lost cat" announcements tacked up on 
supermarket bulletin boards. 
</P>
<P>
OK, OK, I know it's nothing to joke about, but at this point I really wouldn't 
mind if both the cats and the kid were temporarily among the missing (and I 
really do want to know how you lose a cat). 
</P>
<P>
First of all, I am right-handed and, of course, the procedure was on my right 
wrist, so even the simplest of my daily routines has been destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
I'm relegated to wearing what look to me, anyway, like maternity clothes -- 
loose garments with no buttons or zippers. I can't shave, and each day I look 
more like Walter Huston in "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre." 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is that I've temporarily become quite dependent on others. In 
my case, that's singular, an 11-year-old with more compassion than skills. 
</P>
<P>
And needs he's unaccustomed to having ignored. 
</P>
<P>
He has become chief cook ("Is this supposed to be smoking like this?"), 
dishwasher ("Why can't I leave them until morning?"), laundry-tender ("Why 
should I fold the sheets when all I'm going to do is put them on the bed?"), 
house-keeper ("The living room looks fine to me") and stenographer ("You're 
going too fast!"). 
</P>
<P>
In the mornings, he must make his own breakfast and pack a lunch ("What's wrong 
with just potato chips and Kudos?") and do the dishes. 
</P>
<P>
When he's finally off to school, I have this overwhelming desire to sit in a 
dark room and babble. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, I sit in a light one and try to figure out how to while away the day. 
I've found that there's such a thing as reading too much and that after a while 
the words start becoming one, as do the titles of the books. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there's always daytime television, which I've discovered makes 
nighttime television seem like Academe. 
</P>
<P>
According to my cable guide, I have 30 channels. Why, then, is there nothing to 
watch? 
</P>
<P>
Soap operas, exercise shows, commercials for truck-driving schools, game shows 
that my rather thick cats could win, big birds repeating the letter "B" for six 
minutes, old series I didn't watch when both they and I were young, and 
Congress in living color. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, it's given me new insight into the problem of housewives and 
infidelity. They are driven to it by Pat Sajak and the shopping channels. 
</P>
<P>
After a few hours of television, I find myself anxiously awaiting my son's 
return from school, just for some adult conversation. 
</P>
<P>
I also try to keep in mind my mother's line that "even a mugging is an 
educational experience, if you look at it in the proper light." 
</P>
<P>
It was her way of suggesting that we make the best of any situation and learn 
from it, no matter how trying. It's a line my son is tired of hearing these 
days. 
</P>
<P>
But it might come in handy -- if he ever has to live with a martyr again.

ANN CONWAY: DETAILS, ELEGANT GOWNS DRESS UP FASHION SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Talk about detail. It made the difference on Monday, when the Sophisticates 
swept into a cocktail supper/fashion show at Neiman Marcus Fashion Island. 
</P>
<P>
Bouquets of towering scarlet roses graced the buffet tables. So did 
breathtaking pieces of Lalique crystal. Each guest was greeted by Sophisticates 
president Cathy Lowden -- stunning in clingy caramel silk jersey by Donna Karan 
-- and event chairwoman Martha Green, equally stunning in a white pants 
ensemble by Valentino. 
</P>
<P>
A groaning board of waist-conscious items was up for sampling, including a 
pyramid of fresh fruit and steaming mushrooms presented sans fatty filling. A 
one-man show -- Ron Johnson at the keyboard -- provided unobtrusive background 
music. And mingling with guests -- the most important detail of all -- was 
designer Nolan Miller, creator of show-stopping fashions for "Dynasty," 
"Charlie's Angels" and the "Love Boat" (not to mention the legendary screen 
goddesses Elizabeth Taylor, Lana Turner, Natalie Wood, Ginger Rogers, Joan 
Crawford and Barbara Stanwyck). 
</P>
<P>
"I love a woman to be subtle and elegant in suits or silk shirts and trousers 
during the day," Miller said during the cocktail reception that saw guests 
sipping bubbly beside cosmetic and jewelry counters. "But when the clock 
strikes five, I love magic!" 
</P>
<P>
After guests had wined and dined, they settled back on white folding chairs to 
watch an "International Fashion Extravaganza" that showcased after-five 
creations from designers such as Bob Mackie, Carolina Herrera, Carolyne Roehm, 
Stephen Yearick and Mary McFadden. The grand finale featured dramatic, sweeping 
gowns by Miller, part of his first-ever evening spring couture collection. 
</P>
<P>
All of them have a "body line," Miller said, a silhouette "that is not sexy, 
but sensuous." 
</P>
<P>
"I like fabrics that fall to the body and flatter. The best compliment I can 
receive from a woman is her husband said she looked sensational in one of my 
things. When Ol' Charlie sits up and takes notice, that's a successful dress." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about fashion do's and don'ts, Miller said: "No matter what fashion 
dictates, a woman should take a current look and adjust it to her own style. 
And a woman should never buy a dress because of a label. You buy what looks 
good on you." 
</P>
<P>
The Sophisticates are a fund-raising support group of the Assessment and 
Treatment Services Center of Santa Ana, a counseling organization that lives by 
the motto "Arrest the Problem, Not the Child." 
</P>
<P>
"We provide free counseling for the whole family," Cathy Lowden told the 
100-strong crowd. "They are the core of the United States, a core that is being 
destroyed. Our job is to help put families back together again." 
</P>
<P>
A midwinter night's party: "A Mid-Summer Night's Dream" was a play in two acts, 
and so was the party that surrounded it on Friday night in Costa Mesa. Act 1 of 
the bash for playgoers took place at the Westin South Coast Plaza hotel, where 
South Coast Repertory donors such as Renee and Henry Segerstrom feasted on 
pasta and Peking duck crepes while they rubbed elbows with play director, Paul 
Marcus. After the play, guests convened in the lobby for Act 2 of the bash, 
staged by the Theatre Guild of SCR. 
</P>

Marcus, a Brit, said his expectant wife was enduring the unforgiving winds that 
had been sweeping London streets. "And I'm surviving earthquakes," he said. "I 
feel I have completed the California experience!" 
</P>
<P>
Of his avant-garde production of "A Mid-Summer Night's Dream," Marcus said: 
"It's about the dreams we all have. We all can relate. I hope everybody comes 
away from this play feeling something different." 
</P>
<P>
SCR producing artistic director David Emmes said Marcus was a director who made 
"Shakespeare seem like a living, vibrant, urban playwright. He is presenting 
the play, not in a museumlike, dust-covered way, but in a way full of style and 
vitality."

WHAT PATHE IS GETTING FOR $1 BILLION MGM BUYOUT; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: THE MAJOR ACQUISITION IS THE 1,000-TITLE UA LIBRARY, WHICH INCLUDES THE 
ROCKY, JAMES BOND AND PINK PANTHER SERIES.

<P>
When you consider the number of times its bones have been picked in recent 
years, there is still a lot of meat left on the carcass of MGM/UA that Pathe 
Communications Corp. agreed to buy Wednesday for about $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
There is no more studio; the venerable Culver City lot where Louis B. Mayer and 
Irving Thalberg once reigned is now the lair of Sony's Columbia Pictures. The 
great MGM library, which stored such classics as "Gone With the Wind" and "The 
Wizard of Oz," is owned by Ted Turner. And the current MGM/UA doesn't own a 
clod of physical property; it just sold its last building to Kirk Kerkorian, 
the same man who profitably dismantled the studio in the early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
But Pathe still gets the untouched United Artists library, a studded collection 
of about 1,000 titles dating back to the post-World War I days when founders 
Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Charlie Chaplin and D. W. Griffith were 
massaging it into major studio status. 
</P>
<P>
But while Pathe benefits from that early outpouring of classics -- Griffith's 
"Broken Blossoms" and "Way Down East," Fairbank's "Robin Hood" and "The Thief 
of Baghdad," Pickford's "Pollyanna" and "Tess of the Storm Country," and 
Chaplin's "City Lights" and "Modern Times" -- it is the films of the Arthur 
Krim-Robert Benjamin management of the '50s through the '70s that will be best 
exploited by their new owner. 
</P>
<P>
Krim and Benjamin went on to form Orion Pictures in the late '70s, just before 
Michael Cimino brought the original studio down with "Heaven's Gate," but they 
left behind three major movie franchises -- the Pink Panther, Rocky and James 
Bond series -- that are still bearing ore today. 
</P>
<P>
"Rocky V" is in current production, with Sylvester Stallone reunited with the 
series' first director John Avildsen. The untitled 17th James Bond episode will 
soon go into production. And the pilot for a prime-time "Pink Panther" series 
is being developed by MGM/UA for CBS. 
</P>
<P>
Among some of the other prominent UA films: "Marty," the recently reissued 
"Raging Bull," "Exodus," "West Side Story," "Fiddler on the Roof," "Some Like 
it Hot," "In the Heat of the Night," "The Apartment" and "The Magnificent 
Seven." 
</P>
<P>
During the '70s, a decade that many critics consider Hollywood's true Golden 
Era, United Artists made many of Hollywood's toughest, timeliest and most 
commercial movies. UA's films of that decade alone -- "Annie Hall," "Coming 
Home," "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," "Rocky," "Bound for Glory," and 
"Women in Love" -- will guarantee Pathe pride of ownership. 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA, sometimes together and sometimes operating separately during the '80s, 
have suffered insecurity, inconsistent management and oft-rumored deaths, and 
product has also suffered. One of the few recent bright spots was "Rain Man," 
the hugely profitable 1988 film that swept the Oscars. Industry analysts expect 
the studio's coming video release of "Rain Man" to be one of the year's top 
sellers in that market. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its film library, Pathe's acquisition of MGM/UA brings it the 
worldwide home video and foreign pay-TV rights to the 2,950 films in the 
Turner/MGM library, that great batch of films that Turner took with him when he 
bought and then sold MGM five years ago. Turner bought the library to assure 
himself years of product for his Super Station, and has since begun colorizing 
scores of the best-known black and white films from the library (which also 
includes Warner Bros. films previously acquired by MGM) for TV syndication. 
</P>
<P>
Pathe, an international film production and distribution company that just last 
year bought the less glorious Cannon Films, brings several of its own projects 
to the party. The company, whose production chief Alan Ladd, Jr. came to them 
from MGM, has three films in production -- "Russia House," starring Sean 
Connery and Michelle Pfeiffer; "Fires Within," starring Jimmy Smits and Greta 
Scacchi, and "Quigley Down Under," with Tom Selleck. According to a studio 
spokesman, Pathe has also green-lighted a Sally Field film titled "Not Without 
My Daughter" and Mel Brooks' "Life Stinks." Mel Brooks' last film, 
"Spaceballs," was for also for MGM. 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA's production head, Richard Berger, used to work for MGM under Ladd, 
prompting immediate speculation that he will resume that role once the Pathe 
deal is completed. MGM/UA Chairman Jeffrey Barbakow said on Tuesday that a 
Berger-Ladd merger is possible "down the road," but for now, it's business as 
usual. 
</P>
<P>
Upcoming releases for MGM/UA, films made under Berger, include "Blue Steel," 
with Jamie Lee Curtis and Ron Silver, "Lisa," with Cheryl Ladd, "Daddy's Dyin', 
Who's Got the Will?," with Beau Bridges and Tess Harper, and -- for fans of 
irony -- Michael Cimino's "Desperate Hours," which was picked up for 
distribution from Dino de Laurentiis. 
</P>
<P>
Pathe is also buying into a television operation that is building up steam. 
MGM/UA has three series on the current prime-time network schedule -- 
"thirtysomething," "In the Heat of the Night" and "Young Riders" -- and is 
about to go into production on both the CBS "Pink Panther" pilot and a pilot 
for "Dark Shadows," which is being developed for NBC as a prime-time version of 
the Gothic day-time series that mesmerized college students of the late '60s. 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA operates out of leased space in the Filmland building adjacent to its 
former lot, and out of the Gateway building in Santa Monica. The last property 
owned by MGM/UA -- an office building in Beverly Hills -- was sold last month 
to Kerkorian's Tracinda Corp. for $48 million.

RICK DU BROW: HOW MUCH IS BOB WORTH TO CBS?; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: NEWHART'S CAMP AND MTM BLAME EACH OTHER FOR DEMANDING TOUGH TERMS 
FROM CBS. NO ONE AT NETWORK STEPPED IN TO RESOLVE THE SITUATION.

<P>
Where have all the showmen gone? 
</P>
<P>
The case in question is that of Bob Newhart and how much he's worth to CBS. 
</P>
<P>
A lot. 
</P>
<P>
In two series that brought nothing but style and honor to CBS for 14 years -- 
first "The Bob Newhart Show" and now "Newhart" -- he's delighted viewers with 
wit, taste and belly-laughs. 
</P>
<P>
But now, quibbling that reportedly involves the comedian's contract and studio, 
MTM, has killed "Newhart." 
</P>
<P>
It isn't coming back for a ninth season -- though it could have -- because the 
accountant mentality has taken over TV. 
</P>
<P>
The case is a mess, with Newhart's camp and MTM blaming each other for 
demanding impossible terms from CBS -- accusations that have caused deep 
bitterness between both sides. 
</P>
<P>
And no one at slipping, rudderless CBS, which, after all, is the ultimate buyer 
of the series, has stepped in with real authority and used network muscle and 
showmanship to assure Newhart's return. 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate loser: TV viewers who are seeing Hollywood politics wipe out one 
of their favorite shows. 
</P>
<P>
Let's talk business. 
</P>
<P>
Is Newhart worth as much as baseball stars Rickey Henderson and Paul Molitor? 
</P>
<P>
They're getting $3 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
And that's what MTM executive Mel Blumenthal says Newhart's representatives 
demanded that CBS come up with for next season. He claims it's about a 
one-third pay raise and made it impossible to bring back the show -- because 
MTM's costs would have skyrocketed by having to give others in the series 
comparable wage hikes. 
</P>
<P>
He also claims that Newhart's side made specific demands about time slots and 
that networks insist on reserving those decisions for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Newhart's camp isn't commenting on that for the record -- but counters with the 
jab that "demands made by MTM . . . complicated the deal." 
</P>
<P>
One report said MTM insisted that CBS give the production company a six-episode 
series separate from "Newhart" to assure his return. 
</P>
<P>
Too bad this kind of fierce inside maneuvering didn't make its way into "The 
Famous Teddy Z," the CBS flop about dealings at a Hollywood talent agency. It 
affects what we see. But all that Newhart's admirers want is to have him back 
on the air, and it was up to CBS to knock heads and make it happen. 
</P>
<P>
Let's say the $3 million price is correct. 
</P>
<P>
Life's not perfect, and it's not fair. Teachers, cops, nurses and others who do 
the really important jobs are underpaid while athletes, TV news anchors and 
show business stars are wildly overcompensated. 
</P>
<P>
But that's the way it is. It's simply a matter of what the market will bear. 
</P>
<P>
So is $3 million too much? You decide: 
</P>
<P>
Baseball star Will Clark gets $3.75 million a year. Outrageous, right? But by 
this standard, someone like Newhart looks like $10 million in comparison. 
</P>
<P>
Anchors Paul Moyer and Jerry Dunphy earn about $1 million annually. Is Newhart 
only worth three times as much? 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Norville and Paula Zahn also get in the $1 million range as news 
anchors on the network morning shows. Are they worth even one-third of what 
Newhart gets? 
</P>
<P>
Don't ask. 
</P>
<P>
It's a mad, mad, mad, mad world, and nowhere more so than in wheeling-dealing 
TV. 
</P>
<P>
But Newhart is one of the great stars in TV history, and if he asked for $3 
million for 22 episodes next season, that breaks down to about $136,000 a show. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Selleck reportedly got $220,000 an episode for "Magnum, P.I." Other series 
headliners, including Larry Hagman of "Dallas," have earned more than $100,000 
a show. Bill Cosby can't even count his money. Same thing for Oprah Winfrey; 
we're talking reportedly $30 million to $40 million a year. Alan Alda wasn't 
close, but he was way up there in "MASH." 
</P>
<P>
Newhart is probably embarrassed that the whole matter came up. He's got one of 
the great personal images in TV, and it's well-deserved. A gentleman. 
</P>
<P>
CBS wanted "Newhart" back. He wanted to come back. He apparently put in a bid 
for a specific time slot, but an associate says, "Those were his druthers, not 
his demands." 
</P>
<P>
The network's entertainment chief, Jeff Sagansky, isn't commenting on 
negotiations. Newhart may return in another CBS series in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
But the comedian's statement announcing the end of the series was a subtle 
reminder of how CBS bumped his show around the prime-time lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"The audience," he said, "was wonderfully loyal, following us as we moved 
around the Monday night schedule." 
</P>
<P>
"Newhart" started the season at 10:30 p.m., a tough hour for sitcoms. It's now 
on at 10 p.m., not much better. Last season it was on at 8 p.m. The year before 
that it was 9 p.m. And it still manages respectable ratings. 
</P>
<P>
MTM's Blumenthal has his own perspective. A pay raise for Newhart, he says, 
would mean the same percentage hike for others on the show, "which is what we 
did this year." 
</P>
<P>
And that, he says, would take the half-hour show "above a million dollars to do 
an episode. This year, it's in the mid-to-high $700,000s." 
</P>
<P>
He says the series is currently operating at a deficit of about $130,000 to 
$160,000 a show, and that the jump in costs probably would have escalated the 
figure "to the high $200,000s." 
</P>
<P>
The network pays a "license fee" covering most of the cost of an episode. 
Production companies take the deficit risk, hoping they make a killing in 
reruns, the big payoff. 
</P>
<P>
Blumenthal says MTM has enough episodes for reruns -- 184 -- and that some 
stations have a limit "on how many they take" in a deal. If episodes "aren't 
sold in syndication, it's hard to recover the investment." 
</P>
<P>
Let's wait a minute here. 
</P>
<P>
Suppose Newhart wants a raise. Suppose the whole deal winds up costing MTM, as 
Blumenthal has suggested, nearly double its deficit -- let's say about an extra 
$140,000 a week. For 22 weeks, a whole season, that's maybe $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Is it worth it for CBS to cover the cost, a rather piddling amount -- roughly 
the price of four 30-second Super Bowl commercials? In many cases, no. But for 
Newhart, you bet. 
</P>
<P>
It's a complicated matter, and maybe that wouldn't solve things. MTM frankly 
has separate pilot projects in the works for "Newhart" performers Julia Duffy 
and Peter Scolari, as well as for producers Mark Egan and Mark Solomon -- 
which, Blumenthal concedes, "await the end" of the current series. 
</P>
<P>
Blumenthal says that MTM also suggested doing 13 segments of "Newhart" next 
season "to bring costs down," and then following it with six to eight episodes 
of a spinoff with Duffy and Scolari, who had a baby on the parent series this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Was this the separate series MTM reportedly wanted? Anyway, says Blumenthal, it 
turned out there "wasn't enough time" to pull off such a show. 
</P>
<P>
Deals. Welcome to Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
MTM is reported under financial pressure from its new British owner, TVS 
Entertainment, which bought the company of "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" and 
"Hill Street Blues" in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But for CBS, few deals are more important than those that keep its trademark 
stars like Newhart -- who define the network -- from drifting away. 
</P>
<P>
CBS already has lost Bea Arthur and Betty White to NBC's "The Golden Girls." It 
lost Carroll O'Connor to NBC's "In the Heat of the Night." Carol Burnett is 
also doing a series for NBC, and Alda came close to an agreement with the same 
network. 
</P>
<P>
Angela Lansbury of CBS' "Murder, She Wrote" threatened to quit until she got a 
terrific deal. Victoria Principal, a star of CBS movies, has quit and signed to 
do two series and at least one movie for ABC. 
</P>
<P>
On the news side, Andy Rooney showed the impact of star power when his return 
from a brief suspension from "60 Minutes" in a controversial dispute led to an 
upswing in the show's ratings. 
</P>
<P>
Sagansky doesn't have much to work with in his attempt to rebuild CBS prime 
time. But Newhart was a major plus. 
</P>
<P>
He also had one of those intangibles that help create a network's image: 
</P>
<P>
Class. 
</P>
<P>
CBS, the one-time Tiffany network, just lost another diamond.

UPHEAVAL CALLS WHITNEY'S ROLE INTO QUESTION; 
</P>
<P>
ART: INSIDERS SAY IT WILL TAKE AT LEAST FIVE YEARS FOR THE NEW YORK INSTITUTION 
TO HEAL AFTER THE FORCED RESIGNATION OF ITS DIRECTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The forced resignation of Thomas N. Armstrong III, the beleaguered director of 
the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, may have been the inevitable 
end of a power struggle, but it is a source of dismay in the art world. While 
the Whitney trustees' vote to terminate Armstrong's 15-year tenure late Monday 
afternoon came as no surprise to art museum insiders, they say that it will 
take at least five years to heal the venerable institution. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is at a dead stop. It's as if a major earthquake hit and we have to 
check all the systems," said a source close to the museum who requested 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
"If you were a potential donor to the Whitney, would you want to give money 
now? The museum is paralyzed. They have a press problem and a board of trustees 
problem. They have to restructure their program and rehabilitate their staff," 
said a West Coast museum director who declined to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong has long been criticized for hiring young, inexperienced curators who 
are said to have neglected the museum's permanent collection of early 
20th-Century art in favor of frivolous contemporary exhibitions. He has also 
championed a controversial plan to expand the Whitney's landmark building with 
an addition designed by architect Michael Graves. The Madison Avenue museum 
desperately needs more space to carry out programs demanded by the public and 
the board, but the expansion has faced fierce opposition because it requires 
destroying historic brownstones adjacent to the present museum and diminishing 
the imposing presence of the Whitney's Marcel Breuer building. 
</P>
<P>
Such battles come with the territory of contemporary art and high-profile 
museums, but the debate about Armstrong's stewardship recently heated up to a 
boil, and his deteriorating relationship with some of the Whitney's trustees 
has been aired in the New York press. 
</P>
<P>
"War at the Whitney," New York magazine's Feb. 12 cover story, detailed a rift 
between museum president William S. Woodside and Armstrong, who has transformed 
the museum from a rather dowdy repository of unfashionable old art to what is 
perceived as a flashy showcase for young hotshots. 
</P>
<P>
A New York Times commentary on Feb. 18 challenged the Whitney to define its 
role and to develop a "wider perspective." Art critic Michael Kimmelman said 
the Whitney's "greatest failing has been the haphazard and at times 
contemptuous way the past has been treated." He accused the museum of viewing 
itself as "a kind of cheerleader for American art, indecorously rooting for one 
commercial star after another." Armstrong and his curatorial staff responded 
with a letter to the editor denying Kimmelman's accusations and listing 
historical exhibitions at the Whitney. 
</P>
<P>
Woodside had asked Armstrong to resign in November, but Armstrong refused and 
lined up support at the Whitney and other museums. When the conflict reached an 
impasse, Armstrong still declined to step down. A committee headed by trustee 
Jules D. Prown, Paul Mellon professor of art history at Yale University, 
interviewed board members to determine their views on the museum's role. The 
committee's report was reportedly presented at a board meeting on Monday, when 
the trustees voted to request Armstrong's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
A one-page press release, quoting Woodside on the outcome of the meeting, said 
that the board "has reaffirmed the Whitney's commitment to contemporary 
American art." But Woodside concluded that it was time for Armstrong to leave: 
"As the board has contemplated the change and changing climate in which private 
cultural institutions will need to operate in the years ahead, it perceived the 
need for a leadership appropriate to the demands of that new environment." 
</P>
<P>
Woodside's statement did not explain what "the demands of that new environment" 
might be. Press officer Steven Schlough said that Woodside and Armstrong were 
not available for comment and that no additional statements would be released. 
</P>
<P>
The Whitney upset has raised at least three familiar issues and renewed their 
urgency, according to museum directors across the country. One is the 
relationship between museum directors and their boards. Directors are hired to 
carry out policies set by boards of directors, but relationships are sensitive 
and subject to change as new members are added and they rise to power. While 
some observers say that the Whitney case is unique to that institution and the 
personalities involved, others charge that Woodside's approach is typical of 
corporate executive trustees who think that the only way to fix a problem is to 
fire the staff. 
</P>
<P>
Most directors interviewed said that an adversarial relationship, such as that 
between Armstrong and Woodside, should never be allowed to fester, and such 
problems should not be aired in public. But one museum official said that 
Armstrong did his colleagues a favor by allowing the press to expose problems 
that are endemic. 
</P>
<P>
Associate director Jennifer Russell has been appointed acting director of the 
museum while the Whitney looks for a new leader. Candidates are likely to be 
attracted by the prestigious museum but repelled by the difficulty of working 
with a divided board. 
</P>
<P>
"Museum directors used to enjoy community support, but you lose the sense of 
what public service means when you start taking the heat. Many people would 
look twice, three times, four times before entertaining thoughts of taking a 
position at the Whitney. I know I would," said Kevin Consey, director of 
Chicago's Museum of Contemporary Art and former director of the Newport Harbor 
Art Museum. "You have to determine what your pain level is and weigh that 
against the enticements. The Whitney requires a high threshold of pain." 
</P>
<P>
The second issue is the role of the Whitney, which is made visible in its 
exhibition program. The museum has been widely criticized for being too trendy, 
but opinions vary as to whether the criticism is fair. "It does seem to me that 
the Whitney follows fashion and that it doesn't give enough scholarly attention 
to its exhibitions, but why blame the Whitney? This is a national problem. The 
Whitney is just in the eye of the storm," said Henry Hopkins, director of the 
Frederick R. Weisman Art Foundation and former director of the San Francisco 
Museum of Modern Art. 
</P>
<P>
No one seems to want the Whitney to stop showing contemporary art, but many 
people say the program has been too heavily focused on current trends and that 
the museum should present contemporary art in a firmer historical context. 
</P>
<P>
There has been talk of expanding the Whitney's strictly American scope to make 
it more international. Most people in the field, however, seem to favor 
strengthening the Whitney's position as the country's premier museum of 
20th-Century American art. Earl A. Powell, director of the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art, said he would like to see the Whitney remain an American art 
museum while engaging in "a broader analysis" of the museum's role in a 
multicultural society. The Whitney is positioned to carve out a highly relevant 
place for itself as an American art museum that reflects the country's unique 
diversity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Art world discussions of the Whitney's role indicate confusion within the 
museum, Consey said. The Whitney hasn't adequately defined itself, so outside 
forces have attempted "to fill in the blanks" and tell the museum what it 
should be, he said. "We had to figure that out at Newport. Were we going to be 
a museum of 19th-Century art, a museum of driftwood and beach scenes? Lots of 
people are ready to tell you what to do. If you create a vacuum, people are 
going to fill it." 
</P>
<P>
The third issue is a concern that today's museum climate of big money and show 
business is unhealthy for scholarship. As art museums have become increasingly 
popular and costs have escalated, museums are under enormous pressure to 
produce more and more exhibitions and to fill the needs of dozens of different 
constituencies. "Museums turn out exhibitions that are so vast, so glitzy and 
so many" that it is difficult to take the time for research that would provide 
historical substance, Hopkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Curators are faced with an impossible task of meeting exhibition deadlines 
while trying to do research on the material presented, according to Susan 
Larson, curator of the Whitney's permanent collection. Larson, the museum's 
only curator who has a Ph.D in art history, announced her resignation several 
weeks ago. She has been on leave from USC, and she plans to return to teaching. 
</P>
<P>
Larson said her decision was based more on the fact that she missed teaching 
and a reflective, academic life style than on troubles at the Whitney, but she 
expressed concern for the dilemma of museum curators. "Museums say they want 
scholarship, but they don't provide an environment where scholarship can 
flourish. This is a very serious issue. It will take a lot of wisdom on the 
part of museum boards and directors to set up a working environment that will 
translate into the production of ever more profound exhibitions," she said.

NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
A search committee is being formed this week to choose a new director for the 
Whitney. Several candidates have been suggested in the press, but no apparent 
successor to Armstrong has emerged. Two rumored candidates, Martin Friedman, 
retiring director of the Walker Art Center, and Robert Buck, director of the 
Brooklyn Museum, have said they have no interest in the position. Several years 
ago rumors circulated that Buck and Richard Koshalek, director of the Los 
Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, were being considered for Armstrong's job, 
but both have denied any such considerations. Other names currently being 
discussed in art circles include Jack Lane, director of the San Francisco 
Museum of Modern Art; Walter Hopps, former director of the Menil Collection in 
Houston, and William Agee, former director of the Houston Museum of Fine Arts. 
Some observers have speculated that the director's job may be split, with 
acting director Jennifer Russell taking over administrative duties while 
another director oversees the Whitney's art program.

JUDGE ORDERS OCCIDENTAL TO ACCOUNT FOR ART; 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: A RULING IN FAVOR OF DISSIDENT SHAREHOLDERS ALSO AUTHORIZES 
DEPOSITIONS RELATING TO THE BUILDING OF THE CONTROVERSIAL HAMMER MUSEUM. 
</P>

<P>
A Delaware judge has ordered Occidental Petroleum Corp. to provide details by 
Monday on the source of money used to purchase virtually the entire art 
collection of Occidental Chairman Armand Hammer. 
</P>
<P>
In an order made public Wednesday, the judge also authorized lawyers for 
dissident Occidental shareholders to take depositions from a top Occidental 
executive and the administrator of the Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural 
Center, which is under construction in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
In issuing the order, Delaware Vice Chancellor Maurice Hartnett ruled in favor 
of shareholders, who have charged Occidental may have engaged in a "fraudulent 
scheme" to artificially lower the cost of the museum. 
</P>
<P>
Hartnett is hearing the case because Occidental is incorporated in Wilmington, 
Del. Occidental officials declined to comment on the latest court move. 
</P>
<P>
The actual cost of the Hammer museum project and the origin of money used to 
finance Hammer's extensive art holdings are key elements in shareholder 
litigation that seeks to overturn Occidental Petroleum's commitment to build 
and endow the museum. The dissidents contend the expenditure -- which could 
total as much as $85 million -- is a waste of company resources. 
</P>
<P>
Hartnett had previously scheduled an April 4 hearing on a proposed settlement 
in the shareholder lawsuit, in which the California Public Employees Retirement 
System, the state's largest pension plan, is a plaintiff. New York investor 
Alan R. Kahn is also a lead plaintiff opposing the settlement, which 
technically was reached in a third lawsuit involving other shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
The new ruling by Hartnett came after shareholder attorneys, including the 
office of California Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp, filed papers contending that 
Occidental had falsified its books to create the illusion that it had reduced 
the construction cost of the Hammer museum to less than $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Henrichsen, a deputy attorney general representing the state pension 
plan, said in a court filing last week that Occidental's denials that any 
museum costs were artificially shifted "fails to rebut or resolve questions 
regarding the good faith" of the settlement agreement that requires the museum 
construction cost to be held to $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Asquith, an Occidental vice president, said in response to a memorandum 
that appears to show he approved the cost-shifting that the document was 
prepared in error and that he attempted to correct the mistake a week later. 
But Henrichsen contended that the explanation "does not, however, address 
similar evidence set forth in minutes of other meetings." The money cap was 
established in the proposed settlement. If Occidental cannot hold the cost to 
$60 million or less, the entire settlement agreement could disintegrate. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer, 91, decided to build the museum two years ago after a falling out with 
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, to which he had originally pledged to 
will his collection. 
</P>
<P>
Shareholder lawyers filed their papers alleging a fraudulent scheme to falsify 
Occidental's books after The Times disclosed on Feb. 21 that internal 
Occidental Petroleum documents indicated the company may have used accounting 
devices to switch millions of dollars from the museum budget to other corporate 
accounting categories apparently unrelated to the museum. 
</P>
<P>
The new court order noted that shareholder attorneys "have raised the question 
of the good faith of the parties in settling this action." Hartnett concluded 
that the new questions over cost-switching and lingering questions about who 
actually purchased Hammer's extensive art holdings "established that their (the 
shareholders') concerns were bona fide." 
</P>
<P>
In a separate court filing last week, Asquith denied such a plan ever existed. 
In the new court order, Hartnett directed Occidental to make Asquith and 
Hillary Gibson, a key Hammer aide who functions as the museum's chief 
administrative officer, available for depositions in Los Angeles, perhaps as 
early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, additional Occidental documents obtained by The Times appear to 
confirm that the company may have acted on part of the cost-switching plan 
sometime last August. Earlier, The Times disclosed that internal memoranda 
showed that on Aug. 17 a meeting of Occidental Petroleum and construction 
company officials focused on a proposal under which McCormick Construction Co., 
which is building the museum, would resubmit bills for $2,266,066 in museum 
costs. These bills would then be charged against different Occidental accounts. 
</P>
<P>
In his court statement, Asquith said consideration had been given to how to 
reapply the amount in question in museum accounting, but denied any of the 
costs were transferred. 
</P>
<P>
But in a letter dated Sept. 1, 1989, from McCormick Construction to John Yates, 
an Occidental official, the contractor provided a table showing that museum 
construction costs totaling $1,181,944 had been reassigned from the original 
museum budget categories to other accounts. The letter acknowledges that as a 
result of the Aug. 17 meeting on reassigned costs "various adjustments have 
been made." 
</P>
<P>
The shifted costs, the document indicates, included temporary construction, 
drainage systems, metal decking and $226,652 apparently devoted to rectifying 
problems caused by the unexpected discovery of an underground spring at the 
museum site.

E. GERMANY ADMITS IT HAS MISSILES BANNED BY TREATY 
</P>

<P>
Dealing a potentially serious blow to confidence in U.S.-Soviet arms pacts, 
East Germany acknowledged Wednesday that it has 24 previously undeclared 
Soviet-made missiles that were banned by the 1987 medium-range missile treaty. 
</P>
<P>
The East German government said that it will destroy the SS-23 missiles, which 
are capable of carrying nuclear warheads but apparently were equipped with 
conventional explosives or other non-nuclear devices. It said two launch 
platforms were destroyed last month. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration, which discovered evidence of SS-23 components in East 
Germany last week, has asked Moscow to explain how the Soviet-made missiles got 
there and why they were not disclosed when information was exchanged on 
missiles covered by the 1987 accord. 
</P>
<P>
The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty called for elimination from 
superpower arsenals of all missiles with ranges from 300 to 3,400 miles. The 
SS-23 missiles have a range of 550 miles. 
</P>
<P>
The East German SS-23s may not constitute a violation of the treaty, however, 
if ownership of the weapons was transferred from the Soviet Union before the 
pact took effect, because the agreement technically covers only U.S. and Soviet 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the existence of the undeclared SS-23s will be viewed as an act of bad 
faith on the part of the Soviets, who demanded during negotiations of the 1987 
accord the elimination of U.S.-made Pershing 1 missiles that had been purchased 
by West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say they (the SS-23s) are illegal," Ronald F. Lehman, director of the 
U.S. arms control agency, told a Senate committee Wednesday. "But we didn't 
know they were there, so they were covert." 
</P>
<P>
Lehman said it was "premature" to speculate on the impact of the disclosure on 
the strategic arms treaty expected to be completed this year. The far-reaching 
U.S.-Soviet accord calls for cuts of 30% to 50% in long-range offensive nuclear 
warheads and bombs held by each superpower. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviets are going to look bad on this, even conniving," predicted a senior 
U.S. official. "Why didn't they come back to us on this earlier and say the 
East Germans had these weapons, particularly after they made such a fuss over 
the West Germans' Pershings during the negotiations?" 
</P>
<P>
During the INF Treaty negotiations, Moscow demanded that the Pershing 1 
missiles be dismantled because they fell within the banned missile range. The 
United States argued that it did not own the weapons, but West Germany 
unilaterally declared that it would destroy all 70 Pershing 1 missiles in its 
arsenal to resolve the impasse. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984 and 1985, the Soviet Union moved a number of SS-23s from its territory 
into Czechoslovakia and East Germany in an effort to intimidate Western Europe. 
Moscow had broken off arms talks and wanted the Continent to reject deployment 
of U.S. Pershing 2 missiles. 
</P>
<P>
At some point, ownership of the SS-23s stationed in East Germany apparently was 
transferred to the government in East Berlin during the hard-line regime of 
former East German Communist Party leader Erich Honecker, who resigned in 
disgrace late last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets never announced that they had transferred possession of the 
missiles to either country. The fate of the SS-23s in Czechoslovakia is 
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure of the hidden missiles raises questions about the effectiveness 
of U.S. surveillance efforts, which rely primarily on satellites to detect 
undeclared missiles. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of the East German SS-23s was reported in a German newspaper last 
week. U.S. spy satellites then found "a couple (of) items associated with the 
SS-23 system, a launcher and a transporter, maybe a canister (in which a 
missile would be carried), but no missiles as such," one source said. 
</P>
<P>
In making the disclosure, the reformist Communist government of East Germany 
said that it had begun the process of destroying the missiles and their 
launchers in February on the orders of new Prime Minister Hans Modrow. 
</P>
<P>
East German Defense Ministry spokesman Uwe Hempel told the East German ADN news 
agency that two launch ramps already had been destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
The entire SS-23 system in East Germany had consisted of four launch ramps, 
four transporters, 24 rockets equipped with non-nuclear warheads and technical 
infrastructure such as repair and maintenance facilities, Hempel said. 
</P>
<P>
"The destruction of the entire weapons system will be completed in November, 
1990," Hempel said, according to an Agence France-Press report from East 
Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany reported that the SS-23s were equipped with non-nuclear warheads, 
but it did not provide details.

PATHE TO BUY MGM/UA IN $1.27-BILLION DEAL; 
</P>
<P>
HOLLYWOOD: THE SURPRISE SALE AGREEMENT PUTS STILL ANOTHER MAJOR STUDIO IN 
FOREIGN HANDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
MGM/UA Communications Co. agreed Wednesday to be sold for about $1.27 billion 
to Pathe Communications Co. in a deal that will put yet another Hollywood 
studio in the hands of foreign owners. 
</P>
<P>
Pathe is controlled by Italian businessman Giancarlo Parretti and other 
European investors. MGM/UA will become the third major studio sold to foreign 
interests, after 20th Century Fox, which is owned by Australian-based News 
Corp., and Columbia Pictures, which is owned by Sony Corp. of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The surprise sale agreement apparently will end investor Kirk Kerkorian's 
20-year involvement with MGM/UA. The secretive businessman, who is 72, bought 
his first stake in the Culver City movie and television studio in 1969, after 
building a fortune with various airline and Las Vegas real estate and gambling 
ventures. 
</P>
<P>
The sale comes just two months after Kerkorian said he was dropping his 
long-running attempts to sell the studio in order to concentrate on movie and 
television production. 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA shares, which had traded as low as $10.75 in the last year, shot up 
$3.75 to close at $17.75 in heavy trading of 1.3 million shares Wednesday on 
the New York Stock Exchange. The purchase agreement is valued at $20 a share 
for both common and preferred stock. Pathe would also assume nearly $400 
million in MGM/UA debt. 
</P>
<P>
The companies said Pathe would begin a tender offer for all MGM/UA shares in 
five days. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear how Pathe planned to raise financing for the 
billion-dollar acquisition, which is scheduled to close June 29. 
</P>
<P>
But the MGM/UA board -- which had approved a similar acquisition by 
Australian-based Qintex Group last year, only to see the deal collapse for lack 
of financing -- extracted heavy guarantees against a similar collapse. 
</P>
<P>
According to both parties, those guarantees include a $200-million "security 
deposit" to be placed in four equal installments of $50 million into an escrow 
account at Security Pacific Bank each month beginning March 9. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Pathe has pledged to MGM/UA $75 million in net proceeds from 
MGM/UA's release of three Pathe-produced films, which include "The Russia 
House" and "Quigley Down Under." MGM/UA declined to identify the third picture 
against which proceeds have been guaranteed. MGM/UA Chairman Jeffrey C. 
Barbakow said Pathe would get back the $75 million from movie advances if the 
deal is consummated. 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA's agreement to distribute Pathe films appeared to conflict with a 
separate agreement under which Time Warner's Warner Bros. unit was supposed to 
distribute the same movies. 
</P>
<P>
A Time Warner spokeswoman insisted Wednesday that Warner Bros. had four years 
remaining on a five-year distribution agreement with Pathe. The spokeswoman 
said she did not believe the conflict would lead to litigation, but she also 
disavowed speculation that Warner Bros. was somehow involved in financing the 
deal for Pathe, perhaps by buying some rights to the 1,000-film United Artists 
library, which appears to be MGM/UA's principal asset. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Berger, president of MGM/UA's film group, said his company has a 
written agreement to distribute the movies, but he acknowledged that Pathe 
Co-Chairman Alan Ladd Jr. had previously agreed to release the films through 
Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
"In Laddie's mind, I think the movies were committed to Warner Bros. But if 
Pathe bought a company with distribution, they had the right to move (the 
deal)," Berger said. Both Ladd and a spokesman declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, MGM/UA Chairman Barbakow, a former Merrill Lynch investment 
banker, said the move will end Kerkorian's involvement with the studio, which 
has undergone repeated restructurings and attempted mergers or sales during his 
long tenure. 
</P>
<P>
"He is selling 100% of his position. He's out," Barbakow said. 
</P>
<P>
Kerkorian's private holding company, Tracinda Corp., owns 71.7% of MGM/UA's 
outstanding stock. Another 9.9% was donated by Kerkorian last year to the Lincy 
Foundation, a Beverly Hills-based charity. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Kerkorian agreed to sell MGM/UA to Turner Broadcasting System for $1.5 
billion, but he subsequently bought back, in separate deals, the United Artists 
division and the "Leo the Lion" logo along with the MGM movie production and 
television production and distribution assets. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, a dizzying number of potential buyers have surfaced, including 
financier Burt Sugarman, Columbia Pictures co-heads Jon Peters and Peter Guber, 
Qintex, Rupert Murdoch, Sony, cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. and, again, 
Turner. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Kerkorian agreed to sell the studio to Qintex for $1 billion, a bid 
that was later topped by Rupert Murdoch, who dropped his offer when Qintex 
sweetened its bid to $1.5 billion. But financially strapped Qintex was unable 
to finance its aggressive bid and the deal fell apart, leaving Kerkorian 
without a buyer. (News Corp., which is controlled by Murdoch, is based in 
Australia, but Murdoch has become an American citizen.) 
</P>
<P>
In January, Barbakow said Kerkorian was no longer seeking a buyer and pledged 
that MGM/UA would spend about $185 million, provided by both cash flow and bank 
lines of credit, to resuscitate its anemic film production and distribution 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
Executives close to the situation said Wednesday that MGM/UA had actually been 
investigating the possibility of buying another entertainment company in order 
to speed its own growth in an industry that is undergoing an intense period of 
consolidation. But a conversation about a possible distribution agreement with 
Pathe several weeks ago led Parretti to make an offer to buy the Culver City 
company outright, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Barbakow said current MGM/UA officers will continue to run the company while 
the deal is pending, in sharp contrast to the agreement under which Qintex 
officers had run MGM/UA for months while they sought financing. 
</P>
<P>
There is skepticism among some observers, given the history of both of the 
companies involved, as to whether the proposed deal will ever be completed, at 
least under the sketchy terms announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Logsdon, an analyst with Crowell, Weedon &amp; Co. in Los Angeles, said 
he is not sure whether Parretti has the resources to buy MGM/UA. "It's very 
difficult looking at Pathe's balance sheet or their cash flow to understand 
where in the world the money is going to come from to finance this 
transaction," he said. He added that anybody buying MGM/UA "should have the 
capital to rebuild the studio, which would take a minimum of $500 million over 
the next two years." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Logsdon, says he is satisfied with the $20-per-share price because, he 
said, "if this thing had to trade on fundamentals, it would be trading at $7 to 
$8 per share or lower." 
</P>
<P>
One individual close to Pathe said: "These things have a way of not happening 
when it pertains to MGM/UA." The executive, however, said he believed Parretti 
would not have trouble raising the financing for the acquisition by the 
deadline. "Don't underestimate Giancarlo. He has his own brand of major 
financial clout," the executive said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Warner Bros. might yet purchase some interest in the United 
Artists library, MGM/UA executive Berger said: "I think they probably have some 
interest in doing that." But he said he did not know details of any arrangement 
that might be pending. 
</P>
<P>
Barbakow said he plans to stay with the company for the foreseeable future. In 
addition to his $1-million annual salary, Barbakow could realize about $30 
million from the sale of MGM/UA, according to the company's proxy statement. 
</P>
<P>
Although the companies said MGM/UA and Pathe would be run as separate entities, 
Barbakow acknowledged that Parretti could move in the future to merge the two 
operations. MGM/UA employs about 900 people, he said. 
</P>
<P>
If that were to happen, it would be a psychological victory of sorts for Ladd, 
the highly regarded and well-liked former MGM/UA film head who left the studio 
in a bitter dispute with Kerkorian 18 months ago. Ladd now runs Pathe's 
filmmaking division. 
</P>
<P>
An executive close to Ladd said it was not yet clear what his precise role in 
the combined companies would be, although it appears likely he will oversee the 
movie operations, which include Pathe's movie unit, along with MGM/UA's 
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer unit and the near-dormant United Artists unit. 
</P>
<P>
Presumably Kerkorian would use proceeds from the sale to feed his expanding 
interests in Las Vegas, where he has announced plans to build a hotel and movie 
theme park, and elsewhere. "I think Kirk wanted to get away from the headaches 
and concentrate on his hotels, theme park and airline," one MGM/UA executive 
said.

SANDINISTAS GIVE ARMS TO FOLLOWERS; 
</P>
<P>
NICARAGUA: THOUSANDS OF WEAPONS ARE BEING PASSED OUT TO CIVILIANS. THE INCOMING 
GOVERNMENT SAYS THIS COULD THREATEN ITS ABILITY TO TAKE OVER AND GOVERN.

<P>
JINOTEGA, Nicaragua 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since losing last month's elections, the Sandinista government has handed out 
thousands of guns to its supporters in urban neighborhoods, factories and 
collective farms in the name of self-defense during the post-revolutionary era, 
aides to President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The weapons distribution was confirmed by those who received them in two 
northern provinces and by witnesses elsewhere in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone here is getting arms. It's incredible!" exclaimed Luis Serrano, an 
Organization of American States official monitoring post-election developments 
in northern Nicaragua. "It's a bomb that could explode at any moment." 
</P>
<P>
The sudden expansion of informal Sandinista militia and reserve units is 
helping the ruling party to offset large-scale defections from its power base, 
the Sandinista regular army. Chamorro has vowed to reduce the size of the army 
by ending the draft when she takes office April 25. 
</P>
<P>
Her aides asserted Wednesday that more than 10,000 Soviet-designed AK-47 
assault rifles and pistols have been distributed since the Feb. 25 election. 
They said the guns could prevent her from taking effective control of the 
country, even if the Sandinistas hand over the Defense and Security ministries. 
</P>
<P>
"These arms in the hands of civilians -- irresponsible civilians, as many 
Sandinistas are -- could lead to conflicts that nobody can control," declared 
Virgilio Godoy, the vice president-elect, who said that two of his neighbors in 
Managua had been armed in the past week. 
</P>
<P>
Sandinista officials here in northern Nicaragua insist that the arms handouts 
are closely managed by the military and aimed at protecting cities such as 
Jinotega from the U.S.-backed Contras, who might be emboldened by Chamorro's 
victory to attack Sandinista party militants. 
</P>
<P>
But Col. Manuel Salvatierra, the Sandinista army commander in the north, 
conceded that some people are being armed to give them greater security about 
property and other rights gained during the decade-old Sandinista revolution. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of tension and expectation over what will happen when the new 
government takes over," Salvatierra said in an interview. "A poor old lady who 
is worried about some rich s.o.b. taking away her little plot of land has to 
feel like she can defend it." 
</P>
<P>
One such woman is Francisca Castilblanco, 52, an illiterate tortilla merchant 
who supports four children in a two-room house in the Roger Angin slum 
neighborhood of Jinotega. Hers is one of 340 families given parcels of land 
seized by the Sandinistas from a wealthy farmer who now, according to 
residents, is threatening to take the land back. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 27, two days after the election, 400 AK-47s were unloaded from two army 
trucks at the home of a Sandinista leader in the slum and distributed to 
selected residents, with those as young as 15 receiving them. Ten old rifles 
belonging to the neighborhood's inactive vigilante force were collected. 
</P>
<P>
"If (the old landlord) returns, he won't come here with sweets," Castilblanco 
said, proudly showing her assault rifle and two ammunition clips. "We will have 
to defend ourselves with bullets." 
</P>
<P>
Like other Sandinistas, she calls Chamorro and the 14-party National Opposition 
Union (UNO) "enemies of the poor" and covers her walls with large newspaper 
photographs of defeated President Daniel Ortega. 
</P>
<P>
"We will give up these arms when Daniel orders us to do so," she said. "He will 
still be the leader of the people." 
</P>
<P>
The arms delivery to her slum appears to be part of a major decentralization of 
the Sandinista armed forces in the wake of Ortega's defeat -- one that could 
make them harder to control. 
</P>
<P>
At the height of an eight-year Contra war in 1986, Sandinista officials counted 
100,000 citizens under arms and another 300,000 ready to take up arms -- 
weapons that are presumably still in stock. 
</P>
<P>
By election day last month, the war had been winding down for two years and the 
armed forces had been cut to 75,000, according to official figures -- 20,000 
officers and permanent troops, 20,000 young men drafted for two years' duty and 
30,000 militiamen and reservists on active call-up at any one time. 
</P>
<P>
Since the election, hundreds of draftees who went on leave to vote have not 
returned to their units, according to former soldiers interviewed here and in 
the capital of Managua. Others said they simply abandoned their posts, 
sometimes with the consent of their commanders. 
</P>
<P>
"Two days after the election, our officer told us that anyone who wanted to 
leave could raise his hand, because he wanted an army of patriots only," said 
Manuel Pineda, 19, who served in the 368th Brigade in Jinotega. 
</P>
<P>
To the dismay of the officer, Pineda said, about 100 of the 120 soldiers in his 
unit went home. 
</P>
<P>
At least 300 of the 800 draftees at the Omar Torrijos Tank Battalion in Managua 
have abandoned the service in the past week, a former soldier said. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who don't want to continue with us are not going to be forced," said 
Carlos Zamora, the top Sandinista party official in Jinotega and nearby 
Matagalpa. But he added, "If this keeps up, the army could end up without 
conscripts. We have to fall back on our reserves." 
</P>
<P>
Technically, the Sandinista union workers now being armed in their factories 
are being classified as active reservists, while newly armed Sandinistas in 
city neighborhoods or collective farms are being incorporated into an expanded 
volunteer militia. In lieu of the draft, teen-agers are being recruited for 
four months of volunteer combat duty. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people in five neighborhoods of Matagalpa have been armed and put 
into weekend training courses in recent days, residents said. Two collective 
farms outside the city have received about 2,500 assault rifles, several 
witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
"The guns are to fight against the Contras if they attack, but if the UNO 
people come around making trouble, we will be ready for them," said Jose Alexis 
Guido, 16, the new owner of an AK-47 in Matagalpa. 
</P>
<P>
UNO activists have reported arms deliveries to the Pacific beach resort area of 
Masachapa and other places far outside the northern war zones. Assault rifles 
and pistols have been distributed in at least 10 barrios and a handful of 
factories in Managua, opposition leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
On the night of Feb. 28, two army jeeps delivered a cargo of weapons to the 
state-owned construction company headquarters near Managua's lake front, 
according to a worker there. The next day, he said, Sandinista union leader 
Rodolfo Fajardo announced the formation of a new reserve unit of 150 party 
loyalists "to defend the fatherland against the UNO." 
</P>
<P>
"Their intention is to create chaos so Dona Violeta cannot take power, or at 
least cannot take control of the construction industry," the worker said. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Chamorro's representatives met with Defense Ministry Humberto 
Ortega and warned him that the Sandinista arms handout will make it harder for 
Chamorro to persuade the Contras to disarm. UNO leaders have asked the United 
Nations, the OAS and former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who monitored the 
election, to support their call for disarmament on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not sure whether the Sandinistas are simply trying to pacify their 
supporters or preparing a hidden agenda of destabilization," Chamorro adviser 
Carlos Hurtado said.. "Whatever the case, it's a mortally dangerous game."

U.S. STEPS UP EFFORTS TO HALT LIBYA GAS PLANT 
</P>

<P>
The Bush Administration called Wednesday for "vigorous efforts" to stop Libya's 
production of poison gas at a desert factory, and it pointedly refused to rule 
out military action against the regime of Col. Moammar Kadafi. 
</P>
<P>
The plant "is dangerous and becoming more so," said a statement read to 
reporters Wednesday morning by White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. "The 
international community," he added, "should step up its efforts to deny Libya 
the ability to continue operating the plant." 
</P>
<P>
Asked several times if the United States has any plans for military action 
against Libya, Fitzwater refused to comment, saying only, "We don't rule 
anything out." 
</P>
<P>
The concern arises from a factory in Rabta, a desert town about 60 miles south 
of the Libyan capital of Tripoli. The Libyans have insisted it was built to 
make medicines. But American officials say they have confirmed that the plant 
is manufacturing at least limited quantities of mustard gas and perhaps other 
chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, then-President Ronald Reagan ordered U.S. jets to bomb Tripoli in 
retaliation for Kadafi's support of terrorism. But, despite the implied threat 
of military action against the Rabta plant, the main focus of the Bush 
Administration's efforts so far appears to be an attempt to cut off the supply 
of chemicals needed to produce gas at the plant. In the past, the 
Administration has made public statements about the chemical plant to put 
pressure on U.S. allies to police chemical shipments to Libya. 
</P>
<P>
"We want everyone to make sure that they've taken all precautions against 
(shipments to Libya) occurring," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Libya's potential to produce poison gas has been a major American concern for 
at least two years, since reports of the construction of the Rabta plant first 
became public. At the time, Administration officials said West German companies 
were deeply involved in helping build the facility. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time, we received assurances from the German government that the 
problem was corrected." 
</P>
<P>
Now, "I don't think we can say we know where the chemicals are coming from," 
Fitzwater said, noting that there are "many routes" and that the Administration 
does not want to "discuss any specific countries." 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly would urge all countries to survey their internal situation, 
inventory their chemical productions facilities and to make their own judgments 
that they are not a source for any of these chemicals," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, a West German court ordered the detention of a senior official of 
Imhausen-Chemie, a West German chemical company that has been under 
investigation in connection with the Rabta plant. 
</P>
<P>
Policing the international flow of chemicals that could be used to produce 
poisons for military purposes has proven extremely difficult. Many of the 
chemicals used to make nerve gases and other military toxins are also used to 
produce pesticides and other legal products. International chemical firms have 
resisted some efforts to monitor production and sales of their products, 
arguing that they could lose control of important trade secrets. 
</P>
<P>
Mustard gas, in particular, is a relatively easy chemical to manufacture, 
although some experts believe the Libyan plant may be capable of producing more 
sophisticated nerve gases. Such gases attack the central nervous system, 
inhibiting breathing and usually causing a quick death. Mustard gas sears the 
lungs and skin, causing painful and crippling disabilities or death. 
</P>
<P>
The use of mustard gas in warfare is prohibited by the 1925 Geneva Convention, 
adopted after the widespread use of poison gases in World War I. No treaty, 
however, bans the production and possession of chemicals weapons, and both the 
United States and the Soviet Union possess large chemical weapons stockpiles. 
</P>
<P>
Many Third World nations, seeing chemical bombs as a relatively cheap weapon 
with great power that could be used by them -- or against them -- by enemies, 
have built plants capable of producing poison gas. U.S. experts believe that 
about two dozen countries now have such capability. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush has proposed an international treaty to ban the weapons, and the 
Soviet Union has expressed support for his position. Efforts to draft a treaty, 
however, have been complicated by questions about how it would be policed. 
</P>
<P>
Chemical weapons have been used repeatedly in recent years in conflicts between 
Third World nations, particularly in the Iran-Iraq War. In addition, U.S. 
officials worry that the chemicals could also be used by terrorist groups to 
attack civilian populations. Kadafi's links with terrorists have made Libya's 
production of poison gas of particular concern. 
</P>
<P>
The Libyans consistently have denied that the plant is designed to produce 
chemical weapons, a position they reiterated Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Jana, the Libyan news agency, quoted an unnamed Libyan Foreign Ministry 
official as having "disclaimed" reports that Libya had produced "quantities of 
chemical weapons in (the) Rabta medicine factory." 
</P>
<P>
"Such allegations aired at present by some media circles aim at creating a 
state of suspicion," the agency quoted the official as saying.

SUSPECT SAYS DEVIL TOLD HIM TO MURDER 3-YEAR-OLD AND HE'S 'NOT SORRY' 
</P>

Michael Robert Pacewitz, the Fullerton man accused of stabbing to death a 
3-year-old girl, said in a jail interview Wednesday that he is a devil 
worshiper and that Satan told him to kill the toddler. 
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old unemployed painter said he thought about killing Marcelline 
Onick for three hours before stabbing her to death last Saturday while he was 
baby-sitting her and her half brother, 9-month-old Vasshawn Robinson, both the 
children of a neighbor, Joanne Boydston, 25. Vasshawn was not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"The devil wanted me to do it and I wanted to do it for him," Pacewitz said in 
the medical ward of Orange County Jail in Santa Ana. "I'm not sorry because I 
wanted to do it. I wanted her dead." 
</P>
<P>
Pacewitz agreed to a joint interview with reporters from The Times and the 
Orange County Register. 
</P>
<P>
Unshaven and disheveled in a jail-issue yellow jumpsuit, Pacewitz spoke slowly 
and hesitantly as he explained how he has been struggling with his sexual 
identity, has long harbored resentment for his mother, has unsuccessfully 
sought psychological help for his problems, and hopes he is sentenced to death 
for the murder. 
</P>
<P>
The attack on the girl, he said, happened after his roommate asked him to take 
over baby-sitting Boydston's two children in her apartment upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
Pacewitz said the children were asleep in their bedroom when he arrived about 2 
a.m. Saturday. He said he lay on the couch for three hours thinking about 
killing Marcelline. Shortly before 6 a.m., Pacewitz said, he attacked the girl, 
sexually molesting her before stabbing her repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
He said he decided to surrender to police shortly after the slaying because he 
wanted psychiatric help. But, he added, "I hope to be on Death Row." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to a murder charge, Pacewitz also faces two counts of attempted 
murder in the stabbing of his mother, Elena George Fontaine, 40, and her 
boyfriend, Juan Martinez Marin, 28, the night before Marcelline's death. 
</P>
<P>
Pacewitz said he entered his mother's Anaheim apartment at her invitation and 
asked to talk in a bedroom. He said he then drew a knife, and she ordered him 
to put it down. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her I wanted to kill her," Pacewitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Pacewitz said he stabbed his mother several times. He said she ran out of the 
apartment, stumbled and fell. He said he stabbed her again. 
</P>
<P>
Pacewitz also stabbed Marin's hands when he tried to intercede, Anaheim police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Fontaine remained hospitalized Wednesday. Marin was not seriously wounded. 
</P>
<P>
When asked what prompted the attack on his mother, Pacewitz thought a moment 
and replied: "I didn't like my mother . . . want to go back and kill my 
mother." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators from the Fullerton and Anaheim police departments were 
unavailable to comment on Pacewitz's interview. 
</P>
<P>
A law enforcement officer involved in the case, who asked not to be named, 
confirmed that Pacewitz had admitted molesting Marcelline. However, he said, 
there is no evidence that she was molested. He also said Pacewitz never 
mentioned his interest in satanic worship to police. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Mel Jensen, who is prosecuting the case, 
declined comment on Pacewitz's interview. 
</P>
<P>
Jensen said, however, that past murder defendants have made similar public 
statements to aid an insanity defense. If Pacewitz were to do so in this case, 
Jensen said, he would have to prove he was insane at the time of the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell if (what Pacewitz said in the interview) is legitimate or if he 
is manufacturing this," Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Deputy Public Defender E. Robert Goss, who is representing 
Pacewitz, also declined comment on the interview. Goss said he had instructed 
his client Tuesday not to speak with anyone before consulting with him first, 
and that a court order was issued earlier this week barring unauthorized 
interviews with Pacewitz.

COUNTY ACCUSED OF LETTING FOSTER CHILDREN SUFFER ABUSE; 
</P>
<P>
WELFARE: CALIFORNIA'S CHIEF OF SOCIAL SERVICES SAYS L.A. AGENCY HAS FAILED TO 
PROTECT ITS WARDS AND REPORT PROBLEMS PROMPTLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services has continuously 
failed to protect children in foster care from substandard conditions and 
physical and sexual abuse, including instances where 10 children were found 
sleeping on the floor of a garage and 20 infants were kept in 10 cribs, 
according to state officials. 
</P>
<P>
State Department of Social Services officials said they are considering 
stripping the county of its authority to license and monitor foster homes. 
</P>
<P>
In a scathing letter to Robert Chaffee, director of county children's services, 
Linda McMahon, head of state social services, accused county officials of 
repeatedly failing to promptly report deaths, abuse and overcrowded conditions 
in foster homes to state officials who are responsible for revoking licenses of 
such facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of the revocation cases sent to us from Los Angeles County 
involve sexual molestation, physical abuse or death of children in the care of 
foster parents," McMahon wrote in the letter last month. "It is still typically 
six months to a year after the discovery of the incident before referral for 
legal action occurs. This is an unacceptable delay." 
</P>
<P>
Foster homes are operated by private citizens, paid with public funds, to care 
for children who have been declared wards of the court, usually because they 
have been abandoned, neglected or abused. Los Angeles County is paid $3.3 
million a year by the state to license and monitor 3,800 foster homes that 
house more than 10,000 children. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon's five-page letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Times, details 
two recent cases in which county children's services officials allegedly failed 
to take prompt action after discovering dangerous conditions in foster homes. 
In one case, county officials last July allegedly discovered 10 children 
sleeping on the floor of a foster home garage and 10 more youngsters living in 
one bedroom upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
"Three of the children have been abused, two of them severely," the letter 
said. Despite this, McMahon charged that county officials waited five months 
before reporting the case to state officials for license revocation. 
</P>
<P>
When the home was finally closed in January, the letter says, "Los Angeles 
County removed five . . . children who were still in placement. Based on a 
medical examination, one of the children was determined to have been physically 
abused, resulting in a skull fracture and two broken limbs." 
</P>
<P>
The letter cites another case in which county officials in late November 
allegedly found one person in a foster home looking after 20 infants who were 
sleeping in 10 cribs. The home was licensed for only four children, but county 
officials allegedly failed to report the conditions to the state, pending a 
coroner's report on the death of a baby who had been living at the home. 
</P>
<P>
State officials learned of conditions at the home "through an independent 
source" and contacted Los Angeles County officials on Dec. 8. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles County did agree to remove the children," McMahon said in the 
letter to Chaffee, "but only after the state informed your staff that 20 
infants in a foster family home licensed for four placements was grounds in and 
of itself to suspend the license and remove all of the children." 
</P>
<P>
When the infants were finally removed from the home in December, McMahon 
contended in her letter, county children's service workers were so ill-informed 
that they had to rely on the foster-care operator to identify the children and 
to help find their placement workers. 
</P>
<P>
In several instances, McMahon charged, "The wrong children were given to the 
placement workers because the staff person at the facility and some of the 
placement workers did not know which child was which. 
</P>
<P>
"After all of the original 20 children were removed on Dec. 8. 1989, another 
Los Angeles County placement worker placed a child in this same home over the 
succeeding weekend." 
</P>
<P>
McMahon contended in the letter that the county has shown no consistent 
improvement in its services to foster children despite efforts by state 
officials to provide such assistance as training in regulations and complaint 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been no long-lasting improvements," McMahon wrote. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon's letter requested that Chaffee send state officials a "corrective 
action plan" by March 1 and implement the plan July 1. Otherwise, the state 
might terminate its contract giving the county responsibility for licensing and 
monitoring foster homes. 
</P>
<P>
The state would take over licensing and monitoring responsibilities if the 
contract were terminated, according to Larry Bolton, assistant chief counsel in 
the state Department of Social Services. 
</P>
<P>
Bolton said other counties have mutually agreed with the state to give up 
certain licensing authority in the past, but said he was unaware of a situation 
in which the state unilaterally terminated such a contract with a county. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon contended in her letter that the recent cases she cited of alleged 
child abuse and grossly overcrowded foster homes as examples that have 
"highlighted the county's continuing failure to meet its contractual 
obligations with the state." 
</P>
<P>
"These facts," she warned, "have caused my deputy directors and me to 
re-evaluate our position on whether it is responsible for the state Department 
of Social Services to continue to contract out the foster-care licensing to Los 
Angeles County." 
</P>
<P>
In a March 2 letter in response to the accusations, Chaffee said McMahon's 
concerns in the letter were "difficult to appreciate" and contended that 
McMahon had referred to "isolated incidents" in her criticisms of county 
foster-care officials. Chaffee also complained that McMahon's letter had not 
mentioned any of "the recent program enhancements my staff has made." 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Chaffee also questioned McMahon's authority to request a formal 
plan to correct alleged deficiencies without rewriting the state contract that 
pays the county to license foster-care homes. 
</P>
<P>
"I find no provision for a formal corrective plan," wrote Chaffee. "Under a 
contract of this type we would expect to consult with you or your staff on a 
regular basis and discuss our performance under the agreement. However, if 
additional or new information is required . . . these additional requirements 
must be specified into the agreement." 
</P>
<P>
Chaffee was unavailable for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Emery Bontrager, executive assistant to Chaffee, told The Times that county 
officials are themselves considering turning over foster home licensing to the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
"That would certainly be on the agenda. . . . " he said. "If the state 
considers they can do it better than we are, it's their program." 
</P>
<P>
Bolton said state officials have not yet decided on the next step in the 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
In a Feb. 13 memo to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, in response 
to McMahon's letter, Chaffee said his staff was reviewing the state contract 
"to determine what impact there would be should (it) be terminated." 
</P>
<P>
The memo also said: "On first reading the state letter appears to be a litany 
of past problems. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Bontrager, in a telephone interview with The Times, reiterated the contention 
that the state's "isolated" examples contain "distortions" and represent a 
small portion of the thousands of cases handled. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate letter, McMahon told Chaffee last month that the state had 
rejected as "unacceptable" a county plan to correct alleged deficiencies in 
procedures used to visit children in foster homes. 
</P>
<P>
The "visitation compliance plan" was drawn up in connection with a lawsuit 
against the county Department of Children's Services filed by several 
public-interest law firms that are attempting to force social workers to visit 
foster children at least once a month as required by state regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Social Services was also named in the suit upon the 
motion of the county, but state lawyers took the unusual step of filing a court 
document siding with the public-interest attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
"(The state Department of Social Service) has filed a cross-complaint . . . 
against the county defendants because it has found that Los Angeles County has 
failed to meet the minimum visitation requirements in the state regulations," 
says the document, filed in April. 
</P>
<P>
The county has also been charged in other suits with negligence in connection 
with failure to make regular visits to foster children. Last June, a foster 
child was awarded $7 million in Superior Court after evidence showed she had 
been repeatedly raped as a toddler in a foster home in the early 1980s. 
Evidence indicated the child was left in the home after other children were 
removed because they were sexually molested and that social workers rarely 
visited her and ignored a psychologist's report in 1983 that she lived in "a 
chronic state of terror." 
</P>
<P>
Another foster child was awarded $5.5 million last January in Superior Court. 
Court documents allege that in 1985, at the age of 6, the boy was placed in a 
foster home where he was severely abused, sexually and physically. In 1986, the 
youngster was reduced to a quadriplegic when he was nearly drowned at the 
foster home. Social workers allegedly rarely visited the home. 
</P>
<P>
Bontrager said these were isolated cases that happened several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In her letter regarding the visitation plan, McMahon accused Chaffee of failure 
to be specific about problems in county visiting procedures because of pending 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that this concern had a strong influence on your approach to the 
plan and your unwillingness to make the modifications necessary to ensure 
approval," McMahon wrote. 
</P>
<P>
County officials would not discuss the visitation case, citing pending 
litigation.

When anti-war activist and celebrity Ron Kovic told associates earlier this 
week he was scrapping plans to challenge Orange County Rep. Robert Dornan, 
things looked bleak for those who like a little Hollywood sizzle with their 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
But then came a bulletin from actor Ralph Waite. You remember him. Back in the 
1970s, Waite played the gentle patriarch of a struggling, Depression-era 
Virginia family on the popular television series "The Waltons." 
</P>
<P>
Declaring himself "ready to contribute something on the national level," Waite 
said Wednesday he plans to seek the Democratic nomination for the 37th 
Congressional District, which spans most of Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
If he wins the nomination, Waite almost assuredly would face four-term 
incumbent Al McCandless, a Republican, in November's general election. 
McCandless is expected to easily win renomination in the June 5 primary. 
</P>
<P>
"It is time to get in there and make our country work better," Waite, a Rancho 
Mirage resident, said in an interview Wednesday. "I don't believe the problems 
that concern our district -- education, the environment, health care, senior 
citizens' issues -- are being properly attended to by our current 
representative." 
</P>
<P>
Waite, 61, will need more than an endorsement from "John Boy," his trustworthy 
television son, to topple McCandless. The veteran politician has cultivated a 
loyal -- and generous -- group of followers during his eight years in Congress 
and the previous 12 years he spent as a Riverside County supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
McCandless, a La Quinta resident, defeated his last two Democratic opponents by 
roughly 2-1 margins. And the most recent voter registration figures for the 
district show Republicans holding a 48% to 43% edge over Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
"This district has always been viewed as a no-win situation for Democrats," 
conceded Tom Sherer, a local Democratic leader. 
</P>
<P>
"Ralph Waite is a fine man and would no doubt have a lot to offer any 
congressional district," said Assemblyman Steve Clute (D-Riverside). "But that 
particular district is a tough one and Al McCandless has been popular." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Clute added, "I would not underestimate Ralph's ability to raise money 
and develop grass-roots support." 
</P>
<P>
McCandless did not seem perturbed about the prospect of a celebrity opponent. 
</P>
<P>
"I've met Ralph and he's a personable individual who has been active in the 
community," the 62-year-old McCandless said. But "aside from some name 
recognition," the actor doesn't have much to offer "when you consider my depth 
of experience," the congressman said. 
</P>
<P>
Julie Bornstein, a Palm Springs attorney and member of the state Democratic 
Central Committee, praised Waite as "someone who is committed, bright and 
sincere." 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a lot of celebrities out here, and you see them at functions," said 
Bornstein, who serves with Waite on the board of a Coachella Valley group that 
provides housing for low-income people. "But Ralph is someone who rolls up his 
sleeves and actually does work for charities. That's rare." 
</P>
<P>
Waite, who describes himself as a moderate, joins two others seeking the 37th 
District Democratic nomination -- Jeffrey Jacobs, a paper salesman from Moreno 
Valley, and Johnny Pearson, a retired Air Force master sergeant from the Lake 
Elsinore area who lost to McCandless in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Although Waite mulled a run against McCandless in 1988, concern about finances 
and a lack of organized Democratic Party support dissuaded him. This year, one 
of "the final nudges" persuading him to run, he said, was hearing 
Czechoslovakian President Vaclav Havel, a playwright-turned-politician , 
deliver a speech to Congress last month. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a sense of how inspiring our democracy and freedom are to other people 
in the world," Waite recalled. "I decided . . . this was the occasion to 
rededicate myself to our political life." 
</P>
<P>
Though best known for his portrayal of papa John Walton, Waite served as a 
social worker, a Presbyterian minister and a religious book editor before 
becoming an actor.

BANK THAT MADE CAMPAIGN GIFTS WINS TAX FIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: FIRM HAD DONATED MONEY TO TWO BOARD OF EQUALIZATION MEMBERS. THE 
DECISION REVIVES A LONG-SIMMERING CONTROVERSY.

<P>
Overruling its own staff and a sister tax agency, the State Board of 
Equalization has erased a $3.5-million tax debt assessed against a Northern 
California bank that contributed to the campaigns of two board members. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-2 decision on Tuesday has revived a long-simmering controversy over the 
acceptance of campaign contributions by members of a board who often must sit 
in judgment on sensitive tax issues involving those contributors. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Carpenter of Lakewood and Conway Collis of Santa Monica, the two members 
who received donations from the Walnut Creek-based Central Bank, contend that 
the contributions did not influence their decision and, in fact, they were not 
aware of them when they cast their votes. 
</P>
<P>
But Bill Bennett, a San Francisco board member who does not accept 
contributions and who frequently clashes with Carpenter and Collis over issues, 
insists that the decision is "flawed" because of the contributions and has 
asked the board to set it aside. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides agree that the decision not only involves a substantial amount of 
money for the bank but sets a precedent for the way income taxes are computed 
by banks and other businesses that lease automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
Collis insists it is so important that, had the board ruled differently, 
automobile leasing firms might not be able to continue to operate in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Both Carpenter and Collis accuse Bennett of grandstanding and complain that he 
is trying to hold them to standards that have not even been contemplated by the 
Legislature. Several legislators have introduced bills to prevent Equalization 
Board members from voting on any cases involving individuals who have 
contributed to their campaigns within the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
According to campaign reports, Carpenter received $2,500 from the Central Bank 
over a three-year period ending in 1988. Collis -- who is running for state 
insurance commissioner -- received $500 from the bank in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"As usual, Mr. Bennett is on the losing side and he's annoyed because the 
taxpayer has won a case. It's his custom every time he loses to cry fraud," 
Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, however, said board members should either refuse contributions or 
decline to vote on any case involving contributors. 
</P>
<P>
"I just think it's a common-law conflict of interest," he said. "When a company 
makes a contribution, it's doing that to buy influence. If it isn't, then it's 
serving no corporate purpose." 
</P>
<P>
In the decision, the board majority held that the Franchise Tax Board was wrong 
when it disallowed deductions for depreciation on a fleet of automobiles that 
the bank leased out. The Franchise Tax Board, citing a federal decision, had 
determined essentially that the bank's lease agreements were not "true 
operating leases" because they placed most of the burden of ownership on the 
customer. As a result of the tax board's decision, the company had been 
required to pay $3.5 million in back taxes for the years 1977 through 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The bank then appealed the decision to the Board of Equalization. Voting with 
Collis and Carpenter was board member Ernest J. Dronenburg Jr. of San Diego. 
Controller Gray Davis sided with Bennett in voting for the tax. 
</P>
<P>
In several memos, the board's staff had recommended that it uphold the 
Franchise Tax Board. "Based on further review of the matter, the staff believes 
even more strongly on the merits of sustaining the action of the Franchise Tax 
Board," staff lawyer Robert J. Brenner wrote the board Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
But Carpenter and Collis said they decided to vote against the recommendation 
on the advice of their own staff of lawyers and accountants and not because of 
any influence they might have received from contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Both men said they based their decisions on a change in California law. They 
said that in the past, at the end of a lease period, a customer was required to 
pay any difference between the "book value" of his leased car and the actual 
value. Often the difference was substantial, particularly if the car had been 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Collis said, however, that under the new law, if there is a difference between 
the two values, companies could charge their customers only the equivalent of 
three lease payments. He said he considers that an additional burden for 
businesses that should be reflected in the way their income taxes are computed. 
</P>
<P>
"You wouldn't have any auto leasing in the state of California if the board had 
not ruled for Central Bank," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If the board decides to consider the issue again, both men said they would vote 
the same way. 
</P>
<P>
"This board cannot be held hostage to ridiculous charges," Collis said. " . . . 
To vote against this taxpayer is a vote against giving consumers the benefit of 
auto leases in California."

Cuban President Fidel Castro said Wednesday that he is cutting off all military 
aid to Nicaragua before the new government takes office next month, Cuba's 
official news agency Prensa Latina reported. 
</P>
<P>
Castro said Cuban assistance in housing construction and health care could 
continue if Nicaragua's new government desires, but Cuba would no longer supply 
Nicaragua with petroleum and food. 
</P>
<P>
Castro has close ties with Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government, which was 
upset in the Feb. 25 election. President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro was 
strongly supported by Castro's archenemy, the United States.

NERVE GAS WEAPONS DUE TO BE OUT OF WEST GERMANY BY SEPTEMBER

<P>
U.S. and West German officials announced Wednesday that all the deadly nerve 
gas chemical weapons stored in the federal republic will be removed by the end 
of September. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg pleaded with West Germans to help ensure 
that there are "no attempts at disruption" of the outbound shipments of the 
chemical weapons, which will begin in July. 
</P>
<P>
Stoltenberg said the removal will contribute toward a world-wide chemical 
weapons ban and an early U.S.-Soviet agreement to destroy poison gas 
stockpiles. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. chemical weapons on German soil have long been criticized by peace 
activists and environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
"In the interest of a safe pull-out," said Stoltenberg at a news conference 
here, "I appeal to all citizens who may be affected in any particular way by 
this issue: Help to make sure that the withdrawal of all chemical weapons is 
carried out without danger and without attempts at disruption." 
</P>
<P>
The defense minister did not spell out what form of "disruption" he had in 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Gen. John Heldstab, deputy chief of staff for operations of the U.S. Army 
in Europe, said the chemicals stored at Clausen represented 1% of all such U.S. 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The chemical weapons, in artillery shells, will be trucked from Clausen, the 
ammunition depot near the French border where they have been stored for 20 
years, to Miesau, about 20 miles away. There, they will be put on trains and 
hauled to the North Sea port of Nordenham. 
</P>
<P>
They will then be loaded aboard U.S. ships and carried to the Army Chemical 
Activity on Johnson Atoll in the Pacific Ocean, where they will be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Stoltenberg said that heavy security will be in place when the 100,000 
artillery shells, tipped with nerve gas, are removed to make sure that every 
precaution is taken for safety. The ammunition handlers and truck drivers will 
be specially trained, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The large shells, 155 and 203 millimeters in diameter, will be placed in 
airtight steel cases, the officials said, and packed in 5,000 transport 
containers. West German police will guard the shipments from the depot to the 
port, and commercial flights over the route to be used by the trucks or trains 
will be banned, they said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, then-President Ronald Reagan told Chancellor Helmut Kohl that all U.S. 
chemical weapons would be withdrawn from West Germany by 1992. That timetable 
was pushed forward last year by President Bush.

Philippine opposition leader Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, accused of involvement in 
a coup attempt against President Corazon Aquino, launched a sharp attack on her 
government Wednesday, a day after being freed from prison on bail. 
</P>
<P>
The former defense minister, jailed last week on rebellion and murder charges, 
said in an address to the Senate that prices in the Philippines are rising 
rapidly and the value of the national currency is being eroded. 
</P>
<P>
He also said there are worsening energy and water shortages and accused the 
government of doing little to curb corruption. 
</P>
<P>
Enrile, accused of involvement in last December's attempt to overthrow Aquino, 
denied that he was doing anything to undermine the government. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court on Tuesday freed Enrile on bail pending its consideration of 
the validity of the charge. 
</P>
<P>
After the court's decision, retired army Gen. Felix Brawner, also charged with 
rebellion for his alleged involvement in the December coup attempt, gave 
himself up on Wednesday, the National Bureau of Investigation said. 
</P>
<P>
Brawner told reporters the court ruling had prompted him to give himself up.

GINGRICH FACES A REPRIMAND ONLY IN HOUSE ETHICS INQUIRY

The House Ethics Committee Wednesday cleared House Republican Whip Newt 
Gingrich of Georgia of major charges but decided to admonish him for two 
relatively minor infractions, an informed source said. 
</P>
<P>
After sending a letter of reprimand, the committee will drop its investigation 
of Gingrich, the second-ranking GOP member of the House, who filed the original 
charges that led to the resignation of Speaker Jim Wright last year. 
</P>
<P>
The panel agreed to admonish Gingrich for failing to report purchasing a home 
with his daughter on his required annual financial disclosure form, the source 
said, and to chide him for allowing a senior citizens' group to make use of his 
congressional mailing privileges. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint said Gingrich should have listed the home as an asset and the 
$77,800 mortgage as a liability. 
</P>
<P>
On the main allegations involving a $105,000 fund to promote a book written by 
Gingrich and two others, however, the panel absolved the Georgia lawmaker, the 
source added. 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich, a firebrand conservative before he won his leadership post by a 
single vote last spring, could not be reached for comment on the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Bill Alexander (D-Ark.), who filed the charges against Gingrich, told a 
reporter the Ethics Committee has decided to drop its investigation but 
criticize him for not disclosing the home sale. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander said it was a "practical resolution" of the case, although the 
outcome effectively dismissed the heart of his charges against the GOP leader. 
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles) and Rep. John T. Myers 
(R-Ind.), the ranking GOP member of the panel, were expected to announce the 
findings today. 
</P>
<P>
The committee met behind closed doors for several hours Wednesday but did not 
announce any decision in the Gingrich case. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander began the inquiry last April by charging that Gingrich violated House 
rules and federal campaign financing laws by operating a limited partnership in 
1984 to promote his book, entitled "Window of Opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one persons -- including some of Gingrich's political backers and others 
with an interest in legislation -- put up $5,000 apiece for book advertisements 
and Gingrich's travel on behalf of the book. 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich's wife, one of two other co-authors, was paid $10,000 to run the 
project.

BILL OFFERED TO CURB TINY MUSSEL THREATENING GREAT LAKES, RIVERS

Members of Congress from Great Lakes states Wednesday introduced legislation to 
curb or eradicate the zebra mussel, a tiny shellfish that has infested Lake 
Erie and threatens to cause damage in other lakes and rivers. 
</P>
<P>
"The experts seem to think that this can spread very rapidly, just as it has in 
Lake Erie," said Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio), a co-sponsor of the measure, which 
would authorize spending $4 million a year for five years for prevention 
programs and the same amount on eradication. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation would require freighters to dump their ballast water in the 
ocean at least 200 miles from the U.S. coast. 
</P>
<P>
The striped zebra mussel, usually no more than 1 1/2 inches long, is believed 
to have arrived in North America in 1986, when a freighter from eastern Europe 
flushed its ballast water into Lake St. Clair or in the St. Clair River near 
Detroit. The mussels have since spread down the length of the Detroit River and 
into Lake Erie, moving at about 160 miles a year. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) said that the mussels forced Monroe, Mich., to ration 
water for several days because they had clogged drinking water intake pipes. 
</P>
<P>
"Over 50 other major municipal intake pipes in Michigan, not to mention 
industry users, are at risk from this same type of fouling," Levin said. "They 
threaten the Great Lakes' $4-billion sports fish industry by robbing the fish 
and other aquatic species of essential food sources such as algae and 
plankton." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John Heinz (R-Pa.) warned that the inedible shellfish can easily migrate 
into the Mississippi, Missouri and Ohio river systems, which "could become 
literally mussel-bound." 
</P>
<P>
A female zebra mussel lays up to 40,000 microscopic eggs in a year. 
</P>
<P>
An expert who investigated the problem for the Congressional Research Service 
found evidence that diving ducks and crawfish eat zebra mussels, but he warned 
that there may not be enough intact wetlands to provide habitat for more of the 
natural predators.

INS CHIEF BACKS AUTHORIZATION CARD FOR WORK; 
</P>
<P>
ALIENS: MCNARY SAYS THE DOCUMENTS WOULD DETER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AND LESSEN 
BIAS AGAINST MINORITY JOB APPLICANTS.

Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Gene McNary said Wednesday 
that requiring all working-age Americans to carry an "employment authorization 
document" -- denounced by critics as a national identity card -- would slow 
employment of illegal aliens and reduce discrimination in enforcing immigration 
law. 
</P>
<P>
McNary, speaking with reporters at INS headquarters, said two representatives 
of the American Civil Liberties Union, which has strongly opposed such a 
requirement, displayed an "open mind" about the concept during a meeting with 
him two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
But the two men, Wade J. Henderson, associate director of the ACLU's Washington 
office, and Lucas Guttentag, director of the ACLU's immigration task force, 
said McNary had provided "a complete mischaracterization" of their reaction and 
that they remained staunchly opposed. 
</P>
<P>
McNary discussed the controversial card amid reports of sharply increased 
apprehensions of illegal aliens along the U.S. border with Mexico. There were 
89,925 such apprehensions in February, up 35,909 from a year earlier and 4,495 
more than the January total. 
</P>
<P>
The INS chief attributed the increase to the widespread availability of 
fraudulent identity documents and the failure of U.S. policy to stress 
prohibitions against illegal entry of aliens into the United States. A 
counterfeit-proof employment authorization card would help combat the fake ID 
problem, he said. 
</P>
<P>
McNary said that requiring employment-age individuals to carry an official 
authorization document "would greatly enhance our ability to enforce employer 
sanctions (for hiring illegal aliens) and give us the ability to eliminate 
discrimination" in enforcing the law. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of current immigration law contend that it causes discrimination 
against legal immigrants and other minority group members because employers 
fear they could be illegal aliens and are reluctant to hire them. 
</P>
<P>
But McNary stopped short of endorsing a nationally required work card, an idea 
that has proved highly controversial in the past, saying "it's up to others to 
take the initiative." 
</P>
<P>
The General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress, is expected to 
issue a report soon citing a national work card as one possible response to 
shortcomings in the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act. The new law 
created employer sanctions and provided amnesty to certain illegal aliens 
already in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
McNary said he would prefer that responsibility for a work authorization card 
rest with the Social Security Administration, not the INS. "Social Security is 
more job-related," he said. "We're alien-related. We're talking about a card 
that goes beyond aliens." 
</P>
<P>
McNary said that the two ACLU officials met with him after he first took office 
to discuss a number of issues and that they expressed their opposition to an 
employment authorization document just for aliens -- an opinion that he said he 
shared. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the ACLU officials) took the position it may be that it's more important 
to eliminate the possibility of discrimination than try to hang on to a sense 
of privacy, when everybody knows that's gone by the boards," McNary said. 
</P>
<P>
But Henderson said that he and Guttentag took no such stand.

GENE TRANSFER FOR HUMAN ILLNESS GETS OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A federal scientific panel Wednesday took a potentially major new step in gene 
therapy as it for the first time approved a plan to treat an illness by 
inserting new genes in patients. 
</P>
<P>
The experimental gene therapy will be used to treat a rare and almost always 
fatal childhood immune deficiency disorder. 
</P>
<P>
If the research is successful, the "potential for gene therapy could lead to a 
range of treatments for many presently incurable diseases," said Dr. W. French 
Anderson of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and one of the 
researchers on the project. 
</P>
<P>
"Its basic importance is that it is the first step to something that could be a 
major treatment procedure over the next 10-20 years," Anderson added. He 
characterized Wednesday's approval as, "really the first step. If this is 
successful, it will lead to a second step and a third step." The treatment 
proposal was approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee of the National 
Institutes of Health. It must now be further approved by six other panels, and 
then must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a long way from being done," said Dr. R. Michael Blaese, a National 
Cancer Institute scientist who is also one of the researchers on the project. 
</P>
<P>
However, Blaese predicted that "ultimately in the next century there will be an 
infinite number of possibilities for using genes to treat disease. In the next 
decade or so, you will probably see them used in the treatment of cancer, 
hemophilia and other diseases." 
</P>
<P>
The new therapy will treat the disease adenosine deaminase deficiency. 
Adenosine deaminase is an enzyme that performs an essential function in the 
immune system. Without the enzyme, the body's ability to fight infection is 
crippled. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the only successful treatment for the disease is a bone marrow 
transplant from a sibling who is an identical match. However, the researchers 
hope to treat the disease by replacing the gene that makes the crucial enzyme. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers have learned how to replace the gene in lymphocytes that are 
grown in tissue cultures in the lab. They thus propose to take a small amount 
of the patient's enzyme-deficient blood, then isolate the lymphocytes, or white 
cells, from the blood. The lymphocytes are then to be grown in a tissue 
culture, where they increase 1,000 fold. 
</P>
<P>
Next, the researchers will add normal genes to the white cells. Then the 
healthy white cells with the new genes will be put back into the patient. 
</P>
<P>
It is presumed that the corrected white cells will then flourish, begin 
producing the essential enzyme, and thus restore a functioning immune system. 
</P>
<P>
The therapy would not be a permanent cure, Blaese said, since the enzyme would 
be produced only as long as the genetically manipulated cells live. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know how long these cells last," he said. "Some lymphocytes, however, 
can live for years." 
</P>
<P>
Adenosine deaminase deficiency is "very, very rare," Blaese said. "There are 
only 20 to 30 patients in the whole world." 
</P>
<P>
Last May, genetically engineered cells were injected into a human patient for 
the first time. The federally approved experiment was designed not to use the 
genes as a therapy, however, but as marker genes to track the movement in the 
body of cancer fighting white blood cells. Blaese was also involved in that 
experiment.

Thai police Wednesday exhumed the body of a suspected Japanese yakuza gangster 
believed to have been killed and buried last July in the back yard of a rented 
house in suburban Bangkok. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they found the half-decomposed body of Kaoru Nakao, 53, hidden 
under a slab of concrete. He apparently had been stabbed with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese police, who arrived this week to help Thai investigators search for 
Nakao, said he and two other suspected yakuza members came to Thailand last 
year with the intent of kidnaping a Japanese businessman for ransom.

UPLAND AND POMONA FEEL NEW SHOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An apparent aftershock of the Upland earthquake on Feb. 28 shook the 
Upland-Pomona area at 10:25 p.m. Wednesday but apparently caused no damage or 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
Caltech seismologists said it was centered in the same area as the earlier 
temblor, 4 miles northeast of Upland. 
</P>
<P>
Upland police dispatcher Sharon Goodwin said, "I sure did feel it but we only 
got a few calls on it." 
</P>
<P>
Pomona police said they hadn't felt it nor had they received any calls. 
</P>
<P>
A Caltech spokesman said there have been 400 to 500 aftershocks since the 
February quake that registered 3.5 on the Richter scale. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of supermarkets in Upland said that they had felt the quake but 
that it did not shake anything off the shelves.

GREYHOUND TALKS STALLED; SILENCE NOTES STRIKER'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB BAKER, TIMES LABOR WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Strained silence was the order of the day in the Greyhound bus strike 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Picketing drivers around the nation observed five minutes of silence in memory 
of a striker killed on a picket line in Redding; and silence continued between 
the drivers' union and Greyhound's management, with no new negotiations 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
P. Anthony Lannie, Greyhound's executive vice president and chief negotiator, 
said, "it would not be fruitful" to resume talks with the Amalgamated Council 
of Greyhound Local Unions. Talks broke off when the strike began last Friday. 
Lannie said the union, which asked earlier this week to return to the 
bargaining table, has failed to grasp that "the company has offered every 
single red cent that it can afford to pay." 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), chairman of the Senate's 
subcommittee on labor, urged Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole to personally 
intervene in the strike "to bring the parties together." In a letter also 
signed by Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and nine other senators of both 
political parties, Metzenbaum expressed "grave concern" about the safety 
consequences of Greyhound's use of replacement drivers. 
</P>
<P>
In Redding, where striker Robert Waterhouse was killed Saturday by a bus driven 
by a replacement, nearly 500 mourners -- half of them striking drivers wearing 
their Greyhound uniforms with black armbands -- marched two miles to a memorial 
service. 
</P>
<P>
Some wept while others swore quietly as they walked past a damaged wall of the 
Greyhound bus terminal. A chunk of plaster was torn out of the wall by the bus 
that pinned Waterhouse, 59, to the building. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Strait, president of the council of Greyhound locals, told mourners that any 
union member who crosses the picket line "is walking across the grave of Bob 
Waterhouse." 
</P>
<P>
The 160,000-member Amalgamated Transit Union, with whom the Greyhound locals 
are affiliated, asked members to observe five minutes of silence Wednesday to 
coincide with the 1 p.m. memorial. At Greyhound's downtown Los Angeles service 
yard, 11 pickets, some bowing their heads, silently stood in front of the 
driveway, watched by two security guards. 
</P>
<P>
Shasta County authorities have yet to decide whether to prosecute Theodore 
Graham, 42, of Portland. 
</P>
<P>
Graham had received five tickets in five years, Oregon motor vehicle records 
show. But a Greyhound spokesman said that would not have barred him from 
employment because the bus line permits drivers to have three moving violations 
in three years. 
</P>
<P>
The Greyhound union, which represents the company's 6,300 drivers and 3,075 
office and maintenance workers, struck after Greyhound refused to increase its 
pay offer for a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of negotiations, allegations flew between labor and management. 
</P>
<P>
Union leaders in Los Angeles said Greyhound's Los Angeles safety director, Rudy 
Krause, had submitted his resignation because of disagreements over standards 
used to train replacement drivers. Krause and Greyhound executives in Dallas 
refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Greyhound confirmed union claims that several dozen replacement drivers had 
quit within days of being hired. The company said the total was about 8% of the 
700 replacements hired so far. 
</P>
<P>
Greyhound said its most recent figures indicated that on Tuesday, it ran 31.7% 
of its normal schedule nationwide. Union officials insist that observations by 
strikers indicate no more than 15% of the buses are running. 
</P>
<P>
The union contended that Greyhound is violating interstate transportation 
regulations by overbooking buses and forcing some passengers to stand. However, 
the federal Department of Transportation said up to 12 persons are allowed to 
stand on buses. 
</P>
<P>
The company says it will add 300 more to its roster of 700 replacement drivers 
by the end of the week. Officials claim about 350 more union drivers have 
crossed the picket line. Union leaders place the number at fewer than 100. 
</P>
<P>
The union has sought a higher pay raise than the 6.9% Greyhound says it is 
offering in the first year of a three-year contract. Drivers say they are owed 
more because they agreed to sharp pay cuts in the 1983 and 1987 contracts, and 
because Greyhound recorded a small profit last year after losing $20 million in 
the previous two years. 
</P>
<P>
Also at issue is Greyhound's proposal to contract some work to private bus 
companies. 
</P>

COLISEUM OFFERS PRIVATE FUNDS TO DAVIS; 
</P>
<P>
RAIDERS: PROPOSAL IS MADE AS A NEW STUMBLING BLOCK ARISES IN PLAN TO RETURN 
TEAM TO OAKLAND. ALAMEDA COUNTY WANTS DAVIS TO SPEND SOME OF HIS OWN MONEY ON 
STADIUM.

As a new impediment arose in a proposal to return the Los Angeles Raiders to 
Oakland, the private managers of the Los Angeles Coliseum met Wednesday with 
team owner Al Davis to offer him an advance payment of private money if he 
stays in Los Angeles while the Coliseum is renovated. 
</P>
<P>
Those close to the negotiations said Davis has asked for $15 million in 
staggered payments before and during work on the Coliseum, in exchange for his 
agreement to hold off on any move elsewhere and wait to see if the Los Angeles 
entrepreneurs can perform on their promises. 
</P>
<P>
They said Ed Snider, head of Spectacor Management Group, was meeting with Davis 
on Wednesday evening to make the offer of private money. The specific amount of 
Snider's offer was not revealed. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Los Angeles Coliseum Commission President Matthew Grossman said that 
the commission does not expect to receive any request that it put public 
Coliseum money into the Spectacor offer of advance money. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the Irwindale City Council gave Davis $10 million in earnest money to 
keep if Irwindale was unable later to provide full financing for a stadium for 
the football team. Since then, the money has apparently been forfeited by the 
inability of Irwindale to go ahead with the project. 
</P>
<P>
Word of the new talks in Los Angeles came after disclosure that Oakland and 
Alameda County negotiators are now asking Davis to put some Raider money into a 
projected expansion of the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum if the costs, as now 
expected, exceed the original estimate of $53.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The request for what could amount to several million dollars came at a meeting 
between local authorities and Davis Tuesday night. The city and county, as part 
of a $660-million offer to the team scheduled to be voted on by the Oakland 
City Council and the Alameda County Board of Supervisors next Monday, had 
agreed to put $53.5 million into the stadium expansion, but are refusing to put 
up more. 
</P>
<P>
Davis had no public reaction to the new conditions stated by Oakland 
authorities after the meeting. A call to Davis on Wednesday for comment on both 
the Oakland and Los Angeles developments was not returned. 
</P>
<P>
However, a close Davis friend, Donald Sterling, the owner of the Los Angeles 
Clippers basketball franchise, said in an interview that a deal between the 
private Los Angeles Coliseum managers and the Raiders "could be close" to 
fruition. "I think it would be in L.A.'s best interest," he said. "It would 
take seven or eight years at least, I think, to secure another pro football 
franchise if the Raiders left." 
</P>
<P>
The Coliseum Commission, meeting Wednesday, voted unanimously to issue 
specifications for an environmental impact report on Coliseum work in Los 
Angeles and seek a firm to prepare it. Such a report would be necessary before 
any reconstruction or renovation could proceed.

BID TO OVERRIDE VETO OF EASTERN PROBE FAILS; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: THE HOUSE FALLS 21 VOTES SHORT OF PASSING A UNION PROPOSAL AIMED AT 
SETTLING A BITTER, YEARLONG DISPUTE WITH THE CARRIER.

In a major setback for organized labor, the House on Wednesday sustained 
President Bush's veto of a bill that would have created a blue-ribbon 
commission to investigate the year-old Eastern Airlines strike and make 
recommendations for a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
The 261-160 vote fell 21 votes short of the two-thirds majority needed to 
override the chief executive's decision last November to reject the bill. 
</P>
<P>
The vote handed Bush an easy victory in his second veto showdown this year. In 
January, the Senate upheld his veto of a bill to let Chinese students remain in 
the United States after finishing their schooling, a protection that Bush said 
he was providing without the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Labor unions had lobbied hard for creation of the special panel to help resolve 
the bitter dispute between Eastern and its machinists union, which represents 
about 8,500 mechanics and other ground service workers. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the bill said the bipartisan, four-member commission would have 
been the "last, best hope" for ending the Eastern strike and reviving the 
bankrupt carrier, which is owned by the Texas Air holding company. The chairman 
of both Eastern and Texas Air is Frank Lorenzo, who has been accused by labor 
of engaging in union-busting activities. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's allies in the House, however, said that establishing a commission with a 
45-day deadline to make non-binding recommendations would be unlikely to 
achieve what months of investigation and mediation failed to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
"Lay this controversy to rest," urged Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt (R-Ark.). 
"Don't raise false hopes of salvation." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Glenn M. Anderson (D-San Pedro), who argued in favor of overriding the 
veto, said Eastern lost a record $850 million last year and could not survive 
much longer if its dispute with the machinists union continues. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 236 Democrats and 25 Republicans voted to override, while 13 
Democrats and 147 Republicans supported the President.

LUFTHANSA TO BUY 26% OF EAST GERMAN CARRIER; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: SOME SAY WEST GERMANY'S INTERNATIONAL GIANT WANTS ONE DAY TO TAKE 
OVER ITS COUNTERPART ACROSS THE BORDER.

<P>
In another move toward the reunification of Germany, the West German airline 
Lufthansa said Wednesday that it plans to buy 26% of Interflug, its East German 
counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
Lufthansa Airlines spokesman Stefan Herscher said in a telephone interview from 
Frankfurt that a letter of intent has been signed by the two carriers but that 
a final agreement has not been reached. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary agreement was signed last week, he said, but details have not 
been made final. Therefore, he said, such matters as the sales price could not 
be disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the letter of intent had been signed was disclosed by Frank 
Beckmann, a member of Lufthansa's executive board, at a news conference during 
an international travel conference in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the agreement must be approved by a vote of the employees 
of state-owned Interflug. They have been assured that none of them would lose 
their jobs if Lufthansa buys a stake in their airline. 
</P>
<P>
Herscher said many companies in both East and West Germany have wanted to 
acquire partners on the other side of the border since the East German 
Communist government was ousted last October. A Western-style general election 
will be held in East Germany on March 18 and many contacts have been placed on 
hold until after the results are known. 
</P>
<P>
Herscher stressed that "both airlines will maintain their independence." And he 
insisted that Lufthansa wants "a minority in Interflug and nothing more." The 
letter of intent specifically allows Interflug to continue to develop its own 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
Some airline observers, however, maintained that Lufthansa's long-term goal is 
total integration of the two carriers, which already have some marketing 
agreements. 
</P>
<P>
"This means that Lufthansa -- which has much bigger worldwide operations -- 
over time will absorb Interflug," said Paul Turk, an official of Avmark, an 
aviation management service in Arlington, Va. "Interflug would become a 
domestic German airline and Lufthansa would be the international carrier." 
</P>
<P>
Turk reasoned that if Germany were reunited, "the country's economy would 
probably not be able to support two international airlines. Lufthansa is far 
stronger and has a much stronger international network and would be likely to 
serve the major international routes, including those now served by Interflug." 
</P>
<P>
Lufthansa, recognized by the crane emblazoned on the blue tail of its aircraft, 
serves 178 airports in 84 countries and employs about 50,000 people. It is 51% 
state-owned, with the remainder owned by shareholders and other companies. It 
is Western Europe's second-largest carrier, after British Airways, and operates 
160 planes. Last year, it carried 20 million passengers. It serves 12 U.S. 
destinations, including Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Interflug owns 58 Soviet-made aircraft and leases three A-310 Airbuses, which 
are manufactured by Airbus Industrie, a Western European consortium. Of its 
Soviet-made planes, three are cargo planes and 14 are VIP craft for government 
officials and thus are not used in commercial service. 
</P>
<P>
Interflug has not operated German domestic flights since 1980.

LOCKHEED TO KEEP 'GOLDEN PARACHUTES' 
</P>

<P>
Lockheed's board of directors has rejected a proposal calling for the 
elimination of "golden parachute" severance pay for Lockheed executives, 
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The rejection was in response to a proposal from a group waging a proxy fight 
for control of Lockheed Corp. The group, led by Texas financier Harold C. 
Simmons, last week asked Lockheed Chairman Daniel M. Tellep to allow Lockheed 
shareholders to vote on the proposal at the company's March 29 annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed's severance pay contracts call for special payments to five top 
executives in the event of a corporate takeover. Under the plan's complex 
formula, Tellep would have received nearly $5.8 million if there had been a 
takeover January 1 that resulted in his replacement as chairman. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal to eliminate the payments was advanced by J. Landis Martin, one of 
15 members of a rival slate hoping to replace Lockheed's present directors. 
Martin is president of NL Industries, a Houston-based chemical firm controlled 
by Simmons. NL, Simmons' investment vehicle, holds an 18.9% stake in Lockheed 
and is the aerospace giant's largest shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
In a March 1 letter to Lockheed's chairman, Martin cited Simmons' opposition to 
the concept of golden parachutes and proposed a shareholder vote on the issue 
March 29. Simmons has called severance payment provisions a "misuse of 
corporate assets." 
</P>
<P>
In a letter dated Tuesday responding to Martin's message, Tellep said 
Lockheed's board had decided for a number of reasons that it would not seek a 
shareholder vote on the golden parachute issue. Tellep's letter said the board 
approved the severance agreements because they "enhance the corporation's 
ability to attract and retain the most qualified executive employees." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Simmons group's golden parachute proposal was submitted "well 
past the deadline" for submission of proxy issues, according to Tellep's 
letter. The letter also said Lockheed's lawyers had advised the board that it 
may not be legally proper for shareholders to determine the fate of a proposal 
that would eliminate severance agreements. Referring to the size of severance 
payments authorized, Tellep's letter also characterized the contracts as 
relatively "conservative." 
</P>
<P>
In a letter dated Wednesday responding to Tellep's message, Martin suggested 
that the severance provisions were among the "richest" in California. Martin's 
letter, which was faxed to Tellep, also said severance provisions were legally 
proper subjects for shareholders to address. The Tellep and Martin letters were 
both filed with the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said NL Industries will propose the elimination of golden parachutes 
again if he and other members of the rival slate are elected to the board March 
29. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, shareholders this week are receiving letters from Lockheed raising 
questions about Simmons' ability to run Lockheed and noting that the SEC is 
examining questions relating to Simmons' purchase of Lockheed stock.

U.S. Will Lend to Czechoslovakia: The federal government's Export-Import Bank 
said it will begin lending to Czechoslovakia for the first time since 1946. It 
said the bank's board approved Czechoslovakia for all the agency's programs, 
including subsidized loans and guarantees of private bank loans to help other 
countries import U.S. goods. Among countries formerly under hard-line Communist 
rule, the bank was already doing business with Hungary and Yugoslavia.

$2.2-Billion Plane Engine Order: Singapore Airlines has decided to fit the 30 
Boeing 747-400 and 20 McDonnell Douglas MD-11 aircraft it is buying with 
American-made Pratt &amp; Whitney engines worth about $2.2 billion, the company 
said. In a news release, the airline said it spent four months evaluating three 
engines, including the General Electric CF6-80c2BIF and the Rolls Royce 
RB211-524H, before deciding on the Pratt &amp; Whitney PW 4056 for the Boeing 
747-400. Pratt &amp; Whitney engines are made by United Technologies Corp. of 
Hartford, Conn.

Texas Thrift Sold to Perelman Firm: The federal Resolution Trust Corp. has 
decided to sell San Antonio Savings Assn. to Houston-based First Gibraltar 
Bank, possibly as early as Friday, according to published reports. San Antonio 
Savings was seized in March, 1989. First Gibraltar, formed from the merger of a 
group of thrifts acquired in 1988 by New York financier Ronald O. Perelman, is 
the largest savings and loan in Texas.

SONY'S 'PALMTOP' COMPUTER GETS ITS DATA IN HANDWRITING 
</P>

<P>
Sony Corp. said Wednesday that it would begin marketing in April a computer 
that it calls a "palmtop" that can recognize more than 3,500 handwritten 
characters. 
</P>
<P>
The machine is 8 inches wide, 6.2 inches deep and 1.8 inches high, and weighs 
2.8 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
It will retail for $1,320 (198,000 yen). 
</P>
<P>
Like a laptop, the palmtop computer flips open. It has a screen on the lower 
portion that a user writes on with a special pen. The computer then deciphers 
the letters, partly with the use of fuzzy logic, a system adept at interpreting 
imprecise data. 
</P>
<P>
The product, unveiled late last year, is the latest to use 
handwriting-recognition technology instead of a keyboard or mouse. 
</P>
<P>
"We're targeting it at busy businessmen in their 20s and 30s who need a 
portable mode of data entry," a Sony spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The computer includes a software system that provides a word processor, 
personal organizer and graphics capability. 
</P>
<P>
Canon Inc., Tandy Corp. and other firms introduced similar models last year. 
</P>
<P>
But Sony's palmtop, much smaller than rivals' "notebook computers" and more 
powerful, can decipher handwritten Chinese characters, Roman letters and Arabic 
numerals, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The palmtop is capable of storing 110 pages of Japanese text and has a built-in 
microphone and speaker to record and play up to eight seconds of sound. 
</P>
<P>
An optional adapter will allow two-way communication of data through a 
facsimile machine. 
</P>
<P>
Additional software systems for salesman and the insurance industry are being 
prepared, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Until new software is written, sales of the palmtop computer will be limited to 
Japan.

COMPAQ AND BUSINESSLAND HEAL THEIR YEARLONG RIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year after a messy business squabble prompted Compaq Computer to pull its 
products from the shelves of Businessland retail outlets, the two companies 
have reconciled. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's largest computer retailer said Wednesday that it will again sell 
Compaq machines, one of the nation's most popular line of personal computers 
that at one point accounted for 15% of Businessland's sales. 
</P>
<P>
The surprising reconciliation follows a difficult year for both companies. 
Businessland slipped into a sales and profit slump and late last year cut its 
staff by 7%. Meanwhile, Compaq's sales and profits in 1989 failed to meet 
earlier expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Swavely, Compaq president, said the two companies patched up their 
relationship because the reason for the rift -- Businessland's alleged 
preferential treatment of International Business Machines products -- had 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
"Now Businessland recognizes that their customers expect them to provide all 
product lines on a balanced basis," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Compaq charged that IBM gave Businessland preferential pricing, and 
that Businessland "changed their sales compensation plan to give four to 10 
times more commission (on IBM machines) than on Compaq," according to Swavely. 
He said the commission structure caused the Businessland sales force to push 
IBM products over Compaq's models. "These things have now all changed," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Swavely declined to provide details on the new agreement, but said "the way 
Businessland would state it is that they will present the top brands -- Compaq 
and IBM -- in a balanced manner to their customers." 
</P>
<P>
In a conference call with reporters, Businessland Chairman David Norman said 
discussions with Compaq started last year. "We have developed a relationship 
where we are clearly communicating at all levels at both companies," Norman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Compaq products had accounted for 15%, or $150 million, of Businessland's 
yearly revenue, while Businessland sales of Compaq products accounted for about 
7% of the computer maker's annual revenue in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement sparked a sharp rise in Businessland's stock, which soared $2 
per share, or 22.8%, to close at $10.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. Compaq 
rose $3.625 to close at $92.25. 
</P>
<P>
Businessland last fall began selling NCR Corp.'s machines, but analysts have 
been skeptical that NCR's line of personal computers would fill the gap left by 
Compaq. Businessland had also struck a deal to be the sole retail distributor 
of the Next Computer, the new desktop machine created by Apple founder Steven 
P. Jobs. Although Businessland had originally projected that first year sales 
of Next machines would reach $100 million, sales so far have fallen far short 
of that mark. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Businessland announced that it has accepted the resignation of Enzo 
N. Torresi from its board of directors. Torresi is a co-founder of Businessland 
and has served the company as a director since 1982.

AT&amp;T MAY OFFER MASTERCARD AND VISA

American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. is expected to offer MasterCard and Visa 
credit cards this month in a bid to boost revenues from consumers, industry 
analysts said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The long-distance telephone giant has been studying such a move for some time. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said AT&amp;T will probably offer the cards to most of the 40 million 
holders of its phone credit cards. Spokesman Walter Murphy declined to specify 
AT&amp;T's plans for charge cards. Last year the company confirmed that it was 
studying such a move. 
</P>
<P>
"We've looked at ways to advance the AT&amp;T card (as a product)," Murphy said 
Wednesday, adding that the company has hired three senior executives in the 
credit card industry to work in its consumer financial services unit. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T's large call-card customer base, combined with its billing and 
computer capabilities, would give the company significant advantages if it 
decided to issue regular cards for additional revenue, industry analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
The cards would be good for purchases at stores, restaurants, hotels and other 
retail locations, unlike the phone cards, which are good only for long-distance 
calling. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T's entry into consumer credit cards would have far-reaching 
consequences for the competitive credit card business. 
</P>
<P>
"AT&amp;T is the world's largest transaction-processing company today," said 
Prudential-Bache Securities analyst Charles Nichols. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said AT&amp;T has contracted with Total Systems Services, a unit of 
Synovus Financial Corp., as its initial data processor. Synovus, formerly known 
as CB&amp;T Bancshares, is a Columbus, Ga., bank. The phone company plans to 
attract customers by waiving annual card fees in the first year and charging 
interest rates of 14% to 15%, well below prevailing rates, industry sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't take much to throw a little insert into someone's phone bill (to 
offer them a new card)," Nichols said. "They will make it as easy as possible."

The government announced plans Wednesday to sell off Mexico's two leading 
state-owned steel companies as part of its sweeping privatization program. 
</P>
<P>
A statement from the Planning and Budget Ministry said the decision to 
privatize Altos Hornos de Mexico and the Lazaro Cardenas-Las Truchas steel 
complex was in keeping with a worldwide trend toward private sector control of 
the steel industry. 
</P>
<P>
Altos Hornos is the single largest steel concern in Mexico and is listed among 
the country's top 10 businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The Lazaro Cardenas-Las Truchas steel complex on the Pacific coast was a pet 
project of former President Jose Lopez Portillo, who poured vast financial 
resources into its construction before the Mexican debt crisis erupted in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Further details of the privatization of the two companies were not available.

<P>
Pacewitz, 21, an unemployed painter, said he thought about killing Marcelline 
Onick for three hours before stabbing her to death last Saturday. The attack 
occurred while he was baby-sitting Marcelline and her half-brother, 9-month-old 
Vasshawn Robinson, both the children of neighbor Joanne Boydston, 25. Vasshawn 
was not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"The devil wanted me to do it and I wanted to do it for him," Pacewitz said in 
an interview in the medical ward of the Orange County Jail. "I'm not sorry, 
because I wanted to do it. I wanted her dead." 
</P>
<P>
Pacewitz agreed to a joint interview with reporters from The Times Orange 
County Edition and the Orange County Register. Afterward, authorities either 
refused to comment on the interview or said they had no way of knowing if 
Pacewitz was truthful or manufacturing a story to pave the way for a possible 
insanity defense. 
</P>
<P>
Unshaven and looking disheveled in a jail-issue yellow jumpsuit, Pacewitz spoke 
slowly and hesitantly as he related how he has been struggling with his sexual 
identity, has long harbored resentment for his mother, has unsuccessfully 
sought psychological help for his problems and hopes to go to the gas chamber 
for what happened last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm responsible for my actions," he said, detailing what he described as 
occurring last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The attack on the girl, he said, happened after his roommate asked him to take 
over baby-sitting Boydston's two children in her upstairs apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Pacewitz said the children were asleep in their bedroom when he arrived about 2 
a.m. Saturday. He said that he lay awake on the couch for three hours thinking 
about killing Marcelline, adding that he decided not to harm the boy. 
</P>
<P>
Pacewitz said that shortly before 6 a.m., as the children still lay sleeping, 
he attacked the girl, sexually molesting her before stabbing her repeatedly. He 
said he left the apartment afterward to surrender to police. 
</P>
<P>
He said he decided to turn himself in because he wanted psychiatric help. But, 
he added, "I hope to be on Death Row." 
</P>
<P>
An officer involved in the case who asked not to be named confirmed that 
Pacewitz had told police that he molested Marcelline. However, the officer 
said, there was no evidence that she was molested. He also said that Pacewitz 
had never before mentioned his interest in satanic worship. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to a murder charge, Pacewitz also faces two counts of attempted 
murder in connection with the stabbing of his mother, Elena George Fontaine, 
40, and her boyfriend, Juan Martinez Marin, 28, the night before Marcelline's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
Pacewitz, who said he has long harbored resentment against his mother, told 
reporters that he entered her Anaheim apartment at her invitation and asked 
that they talk in a bedroom. He said that he then drew a knife and that she 
ordered him to put it down. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her I wanted to kill her," Pacewitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Pacewitz said he stabbed his mother several times. He said she ran out of the 
apartment and stumbled and fell, after which he stabbed her again. 
</P>
<P>
Pacewitz also slashed Marin on his hands when he tried to intercede, according 
to Anaheim police. 
</P>
<P>
Pacewitz said he left the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Fontaine remained at the Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. Hospital officials 
were not allowing phone calls into her room Wednesday. Marin was treated at the 
scene and released. 
</P>
<P>
"I could never tell he was going to do something bad, and I never noticed that 
he had a knife," Marin said Wednesday. "It's amazing. He was a good kid. But I 
blame the system because he was asking for (psychiatric) help and no one would 
help him." 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to stop him," Marin added. "But he punched my face and then took off. 
I ran after him and, as I got outside, I fell." 
</P>
<P>
When asked what prompted the attack on his mother, Pacewitz thought for a 
moment and replied: "I didn't like my mother." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "I want to go back and kill my mother." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators from the Fullerton and Anaheim police departments were 
unavailable to comment on Pacewitz's interview. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Mel Jensen, who is prosecuting the case, said 
that past murder defendants have made similar public statements in order to 
facilitate an insanity defense. If Pacewitz were to do so in this case, Jensen 
said, the defendant would have to prove that he was insane at the time of the 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell if (what Pacewitz said in the interview) is legitimate or if he 
is manufacturing this," Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender E. Robert Goss, who is representing Pacewitz, declined 
comment on the interview. Goss said that he had instructed his client Tuesday 
not to speak with anyone before consulting with him first, and that a court 
order was issued earlier this week barring unauthorized interviews with his 
client. 
</P>
<P>
The public defender's office Wednesday afternoon sought a court order barring 
publication of Pacewitz's interview in both The Times Orange County Edition and 
the Orange County Register but was turned down by Municipal Judge Margaret 
Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
During the interview, Pacewitz, who has a brother and sister, said he spent his 
childhood following his family as they moved frequently around Southern 
California, staying in trailer parks and low-rent motels. He briefly attended 
Santiago High School in Garden Grove, where school officials said he was a 
straight "F" student. He skipped the next year before being transferred to Lake 
Continuation High School in Garden Grove, where Principal Thomas Robins said 
that Pacewitz passed all five of his classes but dropped out after a semester. 
</P>
<P>
Pacewitz said he had been a devil worshiper most of his life until being 
"saved" by the Jacob's Well Christian Centre in Fullerton a year ago. He said 
that although he was a methamphetamine addict at the time, he heeded advice 
from church officials to quit using illicit drugs as well as prescription 
medication that was given to him following 1988 treatment in a Ventura County 
psychiatric clinic. He said he admitted himself there for three months because 
he was on the verge of self-castration. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always wanted to be a woman," he said, adding that he is a homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
This past week, he said, he quit the Jacob's Well church, where he felt like an 
outcast because of his homosexuality. He then returned to his worship of Satan, 
he said, because God wasn't doing enough for him. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted money and God didn't give it to me," Pacewitz said. 
</P>
<P>
It was a final act of defiance, Pacewitz said, when he bared his buttocks to 
the congregation at a service last Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to do it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Friday afternoon, he said, he sought psychiatric help at both a county mental 
health clinic in Anaheim and UCI Medical Center in Orange. But he left the 
facilities before receiving treatment. 
</P>
<P>
When told of Pacewitz's remarks, Boydston said she had no idea that her 
neighbor and former fellow church member was so troubled. However, she referred 
further questions to Jan Mark Dudman, her attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Dudman said Boydston feels that she is being blamed by the community for 
leaving Pacewitz in charge of the children. In fact, Dudman said, Boydston left 
the children with Vasshawn's father while she spent the night with a female 
church friend. 
</P>
<P>
Pacewitz's jail interview "shows the guy was clearly out of his mind and that 
it's very difficult to start blaming everybody in the world," Dudman said. 
</P>
<P>
Vasshawn was taken into protective custody by county social services officials 
and remains at the Orangewood Children's Home in Orange pending a March 18 
hearing on whether Boydston can regain custody. Dudman said such hearings are 
routine. 
</P>
<P>
Pacewitz is being held without bail. Arraignment on the murder and 
attempted-murder charges has been postponed until March 16 to give his attorney 
time to prepare the case.

Six UC Irvine students were arrested Wednesday after blocking the front doors 
of the college administration building, an act of civil disobedience that the 
protesters likened to the university's decision to block gay couples from 
living in campus family housing. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests followed a short demonstration in which 90 demonstrators sat 
cross-legged in front of the building, their arms linked as they sang 
spirituals and chanted slogans. The demonstration drew about 350 onlookers 
outside the building and another 75 inside. 
</P>
<P>
After about 10 minutes, police warned the crowd sitting in front of the 
building to disperse, and most walked behind the police line about 25 feet from 
the front doors. The students who were arrested during the choreographed 
demonstration then linked arms to block the doorway, and police took them into 
custody one at a time. 
</P>
<P>
One demonstrator shook hands with her arresting officer just before being 
handcuffed. The six were led to a van waiting in the parking lot and later 
cited for failing to disperse and blocking the doorway, both misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
The protest followed Chancellor Jack Peltason's decision to deny gay men, 
lesbians and other non-traditional couples the benefits accorded to married 
students, including the right to live in the Verano Place family housing 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
"Our act of civil disobedience is an appeal to his conscience," said Napoleon 
Lustre, a protest organizer who was arrested. "We demand that Chancellor 
Peltason set a precedent." 
</P>
<P>
Activists rebuilt their cardboard shantytown on campus Monday in another form 
of protest. After 10 days, the group tore down its original shantytown built 
last month but rebuilt it after receiving a response from Peltason that the 
protesters said was inadequate. The group, known as the Shantytown Committee, 
demanded Monday that Peltason reconsider his position and gave him 48 hours to 
respond. When he did not, the demonstrators blocked the doors. 
</P>
<P>
But Peltason and university officials say they cannot change student housing 
policy, which is based on state law and decisions by the University of 
California Board of Regents. 
</P>
<P>
"The university's decision has been stated," said Horace Mitchell, vice 
chancellor for student affairs. "It really must be pursued in the civil 
courts." 
</P>
<P>
In a response to activists who built the cardboard shantytown in February, 
Peltason agreed to consider hiring an advocate to handle gay concerns on 
campus. But he said he was forbidden by law and UC policies to accept the 
demands. 
</P>
<P>
"This is seen as a broader social issue," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
University ombudsman Ron Wilson said earlier this week that the demonstrators 
believe that they are fighting a civil rights battle that transcends UCI 
boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
"They view themselves as fighting for dignity all over this country," Wilson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Campus police were notified in advance of the demonstration, which began and 
ended precisely on schedule. Those who planned to be arrested wore magenta 
armbands. 
</P>
<P>
The arrested demonstrators said they risked a lot by taking part in the 
demonstration. Protest organizer Judy Olson, an graduate student in English who 
hopes to become a university professor, began to cry as she described her fear 
that her actions could harm her future employment prospects. 
</P>
<P>
"We're asking the chancellor to take what I think to be a personal risk" in 
reversing the housing policy, Olson said. "When I ask him to do this, I'm not 
asking him to do anything I wouldn't do myself."

CAMPUS DRAMA: PRINCIPAL BANS HIGH SCHOOL PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tired of staging standard high school fare such as "To Kill a Mockingbird" and 
"Our Town," drama students at El Dorado High were excited when they first saw 
another school perform the play "And They Dance Real Slow in Jackson." 
</P>
<P>
Eager to stage a contemporary work that has not been performed countless times 
on high school stages across the country, the El Dorado drama students chose it 
for their May production. 
</P>
<P>
Now, they doubt whether the play about a young woman with cerebral palsy will 
make it beyond rehearsals at their school. Earlier this week, their principal, 
Richard Bernier, rejected the students' pleas to let them stage the play, 
saying that it contains offensive language and sexual innuendo. 
</P>
<P>
Bernier and other school officials say that they support progressive, artistic 
works, but contend that they must take into consideration the sensitivities of 
family audiences when such works are presented to the public. 
</P>
<P>
"While it may be appropriate to do at a college or a community group, it is not 
appropriate as a high school production," Bernier said Wednesday. "There must 
be many, many plays out there . . . where it is not so replete with what I see 
as vulgarities. For a high school production, I think we can choose material 
that is less graphic." 
</P>
<P>
Under scrutiny are several scenes in the play, including ones in which the lead 
character, Elizabeth, has sexual fantasies. In one scene, 24-year-old Elizabeth 
fantasizes about the children's song "I'm a Little Teapot," but it is reworded 
as "I'm a Little Sexpot." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, about 20 students presented a petition with 250 signatures to the 
school board asking members to force Bernier to reconsider his decision and 
read a copy of the play that deleted controversial words and lines. Bernier 
said that he will read the edited version but that he doubts he will change his 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll at least read it, although I don't know how they're going to edit out 
every third page," he said. "I told them don't get their hopes up." 
</P>
<P>
Gai Jones, the drama students' teacher, said that she doesn't mind deleting 
words from the play, adding that she wouldn't want to direct anything that was 
"derogatory, sexually offensive or demeaning." But she added that she wouldn't 
change the play so much that it loses its message. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very moved by the play," Jones said. "I have wonderfully talented 
students who would like this challenge. . . . All I ask is that we get a fair 
hearing." 
</P>
<P>
Bernier said his major concern is about the various age groups who go to see 
high school plays, such as performers' younger siblings and grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to take into view community mores and values," he said. "Most of the 
audience at a high school play are not really coming to the play because there 
is going to be this great moral statement about how we treat handicapped people 
-- they go to support the kids. . . . We have to be real careful, and we have 
to consider that Placentia is a conservative community." 
</P>
<P>
But Jones said that Bernier has objected to scenes in other, more established 
plays that her students have performed in the past year, including "Tom Jones" 
and "Lil' Abner," and several short plays by Christopher Durang. Bernier has 
since asked to see copies of scripts before they are staged, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
"He basically would like a happy ending for every play we did," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The play's author, Jim Leonard Jr., said that Bernier simply didn't get the 
full message of the play and only took into consideration the play's racier 
parts. 
</P>
<P>
"My first reaction is, I'm astonished that anyone would want to ban this play," 
Leonard, 33, said in a telephone interview from Tempe, Ariz. "It seems to me it 
upholds and champions hopes and values, tolerance and understanding. My second 
reaction is that I'm proud of these kids who want to fight for this. Censorship 
is a means toward a very nebulous end." 
</P>
<P>
The students, led by senior Melissa Frydman, say that Bernier's restrictions 
stifle to their creativity and intellectual growth. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that made me mad was that if this continues to go on, we aren't 
going to be able to perform anything," said freshman Joel Gladwell. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Patch, the dramaturge at the South Coast Repertory, said that the action 
was a "trifle conservative." But he added that high school officials are under 
pressure to err on the side of caution because of the parent factor. 
</P>
<P>
"Any principal has to know his or her own school," he said. "What may be 
appropriate for one may not be for another. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . I've been head of a college theater department," Patch said. 
"Artistically, you have to make a decision: Is this justified? But I'm sure the 
principal is thinking in terms of public relations, and thinking, 'What the 
hell, it's not worth it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Some students say that the play is right for Placentia, which can only stand to 
gain. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the play has a reason to be done in this community," said senior Beth 
Thompson. "There's always ridicule, and this play shows it's not right to 
ridicule." 
</P>
<P>
In January, students from La Jolla High School performed the play at the High 
School Theater Festival, held at Plummer Auditorium in Fullerton. Walter 
Stewart, the drama teacher at the school, said that no one objected to the 
play, but if they had, he wouldn't been too too surprised. 
</P>
<P>
Such uproar, he said, is nothing new. When he was a high school senior in 1950, 
he was in a performance of "You Can't Take It With You." The play was performed 
before an elementary school audience, and many parents were irate over some of 
its adult content. 
</P>
<P>
"Now," Stewart said, "I'm sure you'd sit there and wonder what on earth was the 
problem."

MALATHION CRITICS ADD ECONOMICS TO HEALTH ARGUMENT

<P>
Each time Medfly helicopters swoop down on Orange County, the local auto 
dealership that Gary Jernegan runs has to spend $871 for workers to scrub down 
hundreds of malathion-tarnished cars. 
</P>
<P>
Rebecca Asano, manager of a local club called Reflections, isn't even bothering 
to open the popular Vietnamese nightspot tonight during the latest round of 
spraying, even though Thursdays are one of her busiest nights. "The last time 
they sprayed, no one knew what was going on and everyone ran out scared," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Malathion critics and some local business people are beginning to complain more 
stridently than ever as they shift and expand their attack on the state's 
Medfly campaign from health concerns to financial woes. 
</P>
<P>
Economics has long been the trump card of state officials in their assault on 
the Mediterranean fruit fly, as they point vigorously to the necessity of 
protecting California's $16-billion agriculture industry from the crop 
attacker. 
</P>
<P>
But some Southland malathion protesters, unable to sway state officials with 
their allegations about malathion's health effects, are now trying to make the 
Medfly a dollar-and-cents issue themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Joined by some local business leaders, they claim the spraying could cost the 
local economy millions of dollars in lost business. They plan to voice those 
complaints for the first time formally today as part of a protest before the 
scheduled spraying of a 36-square-mile area around Westminster and Garden 
Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, some people don't pay attention to an issue like this until it 
affects their pocketbooks," said local resident Bob Taylor, a leader of Orange 
County Citizens Against Malathion Spraying. "We know that money talks." 
</P>
<P>
Malathion critics in Orange and Los Angeles counties are even considering a 
fruit boycott. The idea got the backing of United Farm Workers President Cesar 
Chavez, who discussed it with anti-malathion activists at a meeting in Burbank 
earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
"As I see it," Chavez said in an interview Wednesday, "a lot of people are 
pretty upset because they feel like their concerns have been completely 
disregarded. (A boycott) would be a good way to do something about that." 
</P>
<P>
But agriculture leaders counter-attacked Wednesday with a press conference of 
their own to stress what they say is the safety and effectiveness of the 
eradication effort, and to try to quell rising public protests. 
</P>
<P>
Gathered at a scenic spot in front of an orange grove in Brea, leaders of the 
Orange County Farm Bureau warned that if the Medfly is allowed to infest 
Southern California permanently, farmers would spray thousands of pounds of 
pesticides on their crops -- many times more than are now being used -- to 
guard against maggots. And consumers have consistently said they want less 
pesticide on their fruits, the farm representatives stressed. 
</P>
<P>
If the state is not allowed to continue its eradication efforts, warned Alan 
Reynolds, orchard manager for Treasure Farms in Irvine, "we are going to set 
ourselves back a number of years" in the ongoing effort to reduce pesticide use 
in agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Nanci M. Jimenez, Orange County Farm Bureau executive director, said: "This 
issue has come to a head. And we're afraid the public is not getting both sides 
of the debate." 
</P>
<P>
But malathion critics insist they have heard both sides. And they conclude that 
the effort is not worth the health or economic risks. 
</P>
<P>
Kent Salholm, a Garden Grove chiropractor who is on the board of the city's 
Chamber of Commerce, said he has heard from at least two dozen local merchants 
who have expressed concern about the economic impact of the spraying. The 
chamber called for an end to the spraying last month. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is," Salholm said, "why should Garden Grove subsidize the 
growers? That's really what we're doing. 
</P>
<P>
Added Jernegan, general manager of the Garden Grove Hyundai dealership: "It's 
costing me $871 every time they spray to hire outside help and wash all the 
cars and soap 'em. That's expensive. . . . I don't appreciate it one bit." 
</P>
<P>
Critics point to malls, shops, restaurants and schools in the eight-city spray 
area around Garden Grove and Westminster that have had to close early on past 
spray nights. They say the spraying may even have hurt some real estate values 
in the spray area. And they say they are worried that nationwide publicity 
about the spraying may scare away tourists if it continues through the popular 
Garden Grove Strawberry Festival and into the summer season. 
</P>
<P>
Lucien Truehill, president of the Orange County Chamber of Commerce, said: "If 
the propaganda on both sides continues and it's built into a media event 
through summer, I can see this having some real effect on tourists coming out. 
Who wants to come for a vacation to a place getting all this kind of 
publicity?" 
</P>
<P>
Although local chambers of commerce said they have received some calls from 
tourists concerned about the spraying, several large hotels in the area said 
they have not suffered any real impact so far. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Citizens Against Malathion Spraying estimates a possible 
$150-million loss to the local economy, although spraying critics concede that 
estimates are based largely on anecdotal testimony from merchants and business 
leaders. Several of those leaders will be turning out for a press conference 
today before the 9 p.m. Garden Grove spraying. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
Tonight's Medfly Spraying 
</P>
<P>
Helicopters are scheduled to spray a 36-square-mile area around sites where two 
Medflies were found in the last three months. State officials say the malathion 
pesticide is sae, but recommend that residents avoid being outside during the 9 
p.m. spraying let pets in and cover their cars.

PRICE TAG BLAMED FOR FAILURE OF PARK PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Both supporters and opponents of a $57.5-million measure to fund new parks 
agreed Wednesday that voters trounced the proposal because it was too big and 
too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
The referendum, known as Proposition Parks, was defeated by a 3-1 margin 
despite the unanimous backing of city officials. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Larry Agran said the measure was too broad. As he campaigned for the 
measure, he said, voters told him they wanted developers to foot the bill 
rather than taxpayers. If developers refuse to pay for new parks and 
recreational facilities, Agran predicted, the pace of new building will slow. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way that (the city) could begin to fund (new parks) . . . out of 
existing capital funds," Agran said. 
</P>
<P>
The bond and assessment district would have funded 27 community service 
facilities, including three new parks. Returns showed that 74% of the 10,703 
ballots cast were against Proposition Parks. 
</P>
<P>
The measure was opposed by many community activists, who described it as a 
veiled tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
Jacquie Ellis, executive director of the Irvine Chamber of Commerce, took a 
positive view of the defeat. She said the chamber will return to the City 
Council to develop another park plan. 
</P>
<P>
"We were never against parks; it was just the method," Ellis said. "We think it 
can be done for a lot less" money. DANICA KIRKA

YUDELSON SUES TO HALT PRINGLE FUND RAISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Democratic Assembly candidate Jerry Yudelson has filed a lawsuit against 
Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) that seeks to halt the incumbent's 
fund raising, alleging that he received improper contributions. 
</P>
<P>
The suit is identical to a complaint that Yudelson filed with the state Fair 
Political Practices Commission last August. 
</P>
<P>
But Yudelson said the FPPC investigation is taking too long, allowing Pringle 
to use the disputed contributions in his reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should Pringle be allowed to build his campaign war chest in such an 
outrageous scofflaw manner?" Yudelson said. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, which was filed in Orange County Superior Court, focuses on 
$55,012 that Pringle raised last year to defend himself against a threatened 
recall attempt and a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was brought by voters who charged that their civil rights were 
violated on Election Day in 1988 when Pringle's campaign hired uniformed guards 
at polling places in predominantly Latino neighborhoods. It has since been 
settled for $480,000. 
</P>
<P>
Yudelson charges that the money Pringle raised for the recall and the lawsuit 
should be subject to the $1,000 contribution limit that was approved by voters 
in 1988. Pringle has responded, however, that the limits do not apply to the 
lawsuit or the threatened recall, only primary and general election campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle said Wednesday he believes Yudelson's suit was intended only to get 
publicity. 
</P>
<P>
The suit asks that Pringle be prevented from raising any more money for his 
campaign until the disputed funds are repaid. No date has been set for a court 
hearing on the issue, said attorney Mark Rosen, representing Yudelson. DAVE

HIGH-TECH PROGRAM AIDS SIGHT-IMPAIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sixteen-year-old Matthew Brian Cox is a junior at Bolsa Grande High School in 
Garden Grove. He's a crack participant in the high school's Mock Trial Club, 
and the would-be barrister recently garnered an honorable-mention award in a 
countywide competition. 
</P>
<P>
Matthew is also blind. 
</P>
<P>
But he is able to find a legal advantage in his impairment. "I could read from 
my notes (in Braille)," Matthew said, "and keep looking in the direction of the 
judge." 
</P>
<P>
Matthew is one of nine students in Bolsa Grande's program for visually 
handicapped students that serves the Garden Grove Unified School District and 
neighboring districts. 
</P>
<P>
The district has recently added some high-tech equipment to help educate the 
program's blind and partially sighted students. 
</P>
<P>
"The students are able to make use of several different kinds of computers and 
other devices to help them in their work," said Connie F. Silva, who runs the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Those devices range from the commonplace, such as tape recorders for playing 
back lectures or prerecorded audio versions of textbooks, to the futuristic. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an Apple IIe computer with a speech synthesizer," Silva said. "Most of 
the students have typing skills," and as they touch a key, the computer 
"speaks" the letter in a mechanical tone, she explained. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the talking machines, the Bolsa Grande facilities include a 
machine that magnifies images on the computer screen, as well as the well-known 
Braille typewriter. 
</P>
<P>
After spending most of their day in regular classrooms, the students return to 
the Braille classroom for one or two periods. 
</P>
<P>
There, they can pick up Braille, large-print or taped copies of tests, 
handouts, texts and other materials, usually on the same day that sighted 
students receive them. Sometimes, if there's not enough time to transcribe or 
translate, Silva or an aide will read the material aloud to the student. 
</P>
<P>
But more than equipment is offered in the program. Students get encouragement, 
a sympathetic ear and individual help. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a great thing to have," said Brandi Winemiller, 17, a junior in 
the program with 20/2200 vision. "I feel good about the fact that I can get the 
help here I need. I honestly don't know what I'd do without it." JAMES

OIL FACILITIES ISSUE APPROVED FOR BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE HERZOG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City officials will place a measure on the November ballot that would require 
any proposals for onshore oil facilities to go before city voters. 
</P>
<P>
"The Feb. 7 oil spill highlighted for me and others that we can't afford any 
additional offshore development," said Councilman Robert F. Gentry at the 
Tuesday meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't have offshore activity without onshore support facilities." 
</P>
<P>
Council members discussed the option of changing the city's land-use plans to 
prohibit onshore facilities such as transportation, processing and storage 
structures but voted unanimously for the ballot requirement because they said 
it would have greater impact. 
</P>
<P>
"We need something stronger than an ordinance," Gentry said. "And we need to 
make that statement strong." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Martha Collison agreed, adding that she hoped it would send a 
message to other cities to do the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente is the only Orange County city that requires a vote of the people 
before approval of any onshore oil facilities. Other California cities 
requiring a vote are Santa Cruz, Monterey, San Luis Obispo, Point Arena, 
Redondo Beach, Trinidad and Fort Bragg. Counties requiring such a vote are 
Santa Cruz, Sonoma, Monterey, San Luis Obispo, Mendocino and Humboldt. Eight 
other cities and counties have ordinances that prohibit onshore facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"Having this on the ballot brings it to the forefront and keeps it there for a 
long time," said Councilman Dan Kenney. "We get more bang for the buck and keep 
it in the news." 
</P>
<P>
In other action, the City Council voted to send Gentry to Washington to testify 
before the House Appropriations Committee, which is holding hearings this week 
regarding an extension of the 1989-1990 offshore-drilling moratorium.LESLIE

<P>
Mayor Lida Lenney and Councilman Robert F. Gentry, who hold two of three 
council seats up for grabs in November, have both decided to run for 
reelection, a city official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Although neither has formally announced a decision, Laguna Beach City Clerk 
Verna L. Rollinger said both council members have advised her of their plans. 
</P>
<P>
Lenney "has decided to run, and Bob has decided to run, and it's no secret," 
Rollinger said. 
</P>
<P>
Lenney and Gentry, both outspoken environmentalists, have represented the city 
in talks with the Irvine Co. in a bid keep the proposed Laguna Laurel housing 
development from being built in Laguna Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Lenney, who was elected in 1986 and is the newest member of the council, 
founded the Laguna Canyon Conservancy. Gentry has been on the council since 
1982 and preceded Lenney as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Gentry nor Lenney was available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Other candidates who have announced plans to run for City Council are Planning 
Commissioner Ann Christoph and environmental activist Beth Leeds.LESLIE EARNEST

PREVENT OIL SPILLS, PANEL IS TOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The State Lands Commission chairman warned Wednesday that officials should 
focus on preventing future oil spills rather than celebrating the "near-heroic 
cleanup" of 394,000 gallons of crude that spewed last month from the wounded 
tanker American Trader. 
</P>
<P>
Although he applauded British Petroleum for efforts to mop up the spilled cargo 
after it fouled miles of county beaches, State Controller Gray Davis urged 
officials to "look ahead" to prevent another spill that might be "two, three or 
even four times as large -- and disastrous." 
</P>
<P>
"We can't always assume that every spill will be as small," said Davis, the 
State Lands Commission chairman, speaking at a hearing in Huntington Beach City 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Davis and a fellow commission member, Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy, renewed their call 
for a program to map and survey water depths around California's 20 marine and 
offshore oil tanker terminals in reaction to the Feb. 7 American Trader 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
The 811-foot tanker, owned by American Trading Transportation Corp. of New 
York, struck its port anchor and punched two holes in the forward storage 
compartment while trying to deliver 300,000 barrels of BP crude at a Golden 
West Refinery mooring about 1.3 miles southwest of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Ensuing investigations by the Coast Guard have focused on the accuracy of 
navigational charts. Preliminary results from a sounding being performed for 
the Coast Guard indicate that the charts are off by two to three feet, meaning 
that the water at the site may be too shallow for tankers the size of the 
American Trader. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's commission hearing, the first public inquiry into the spill, failed 
to shed significant new light on causes of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Several key figures in the Coast Guard's investigation -- including the tanker 
captain, Robert La Ware, and the mooring pilot, John Keon -- did not appear on 
the advice of their attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the testimony was a summary of efforts by skimming vessels and hundreds 
of workers to recapture the spilled oil from the ocean and along more than 10 
miles of shoreline in Newport Beach and Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard Capt. James C. Card, the on-scene, cleanup coordinator, gave BP an 
"A-plus" for its skimming efforts, saying that just 20% of the spilled oil made 
it to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Card also credited a revised oil-spill response plan -- completed by the Coast 
Guard just a day before the spill occurred -- for helping officials react 
"quickly and effectively" to the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
He said there is little doubt that the ship ran over its anchor: "The anchor 
fit into the hole in the hull like a jigsaw puzzle." 
</P>
<P>
Card said that federal officials last checked the depth of the offshore mooring 
in 1975, but that he is not sure when Golden West Refinery last surveyed the 
area. Golden West -- along with American Trading and the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration -- has taken new soundings around the mooring since 
the accident, but their results have not yet been made public. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference before the hearing, Davis and McCarthy said that 
government has failed to adequately regulate tanker traffic along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
"This spill should serve as an alarm bell to wake up Americans that we are 
totally at the mercy of the oil industry," Davis said. "If this was an airline, 
it would be grounded." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach and Huntington Beach officials said it was too soon to estimate 
the total damage from the spill. But Davis said the state is prepared "to sue" 
either BP or American Trading if those who suffered losses are not reimbursed. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Webster, a BP spokesman, said that American Trading has agreed to pay all 
cleanup and damage costs.

CLEANED-UP PELICANS TO BE TRACKED; 
</P>
<P>
SPILL: TWENTY OF THE BIG BIRDS WILL BE FITTED WITH TINY TRANSMITTERS, RELEASED 
AND STUDIED FOR ANY ADVERSE EFFECTS OF BEING COATED WITH OIL.

<P>
Twenty brown pelicans that were coated with oil in last month's spill off 
Huntington Beach will be outfitted with tiny radio transmitters todayin a 
federally funded study of how exposure to crude oil affects behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Three UC Davis avian specialists, Michael Fry, Daniel Anderson and Frank Gress, 
are heading the $67,000 research project, which is being underwritten by the 
federal Minerals Management Service and the California Department of Fish and 
Game. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always been a big question about oiled, rehabilitated birds as to 
whether the stress of having been oiled will interfere with their breeding," 
Fry said. 
</P>
<P>
A similar study by Fry on two types of sea birds -- casin auklets and 
wedge-tailed shearwaters -- found that birds exposed to oil frequently 
abandoned their colonies and had lowered success in egg-laying and hatching. 
That five-year study, also funded by Minerals Management, was published in 1987 
and was "the first to document long-term, sub-lethal effects of oil on sea 
birds," said Gordon Reetz, a natural resource specialist with the agency's Los 
Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
After the Feb. 7 spill, 141 oil-covered brown pelicans were captured and 
brought to a special bird rescue center on Terminal Island to be cleaned. 
</P>
<P>
Of those, 64 have been released, 23 died, two had to be euthanized, nine were 
transferred to other facilities and 43 are awaiting release, said Jay Holcomb, 
director of the International Bird Rescue Center. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Holcomb said, the UC Davis biologists will be fitting miniature radio 
transmitters "about the size of a lipstick case" on the backs, just between the 
wings, of 20 adult pelicans "in breeding plumage." 
</P>
<P>
The birds are to be released Friday or Saturday and then followed for several 
months to see if exposure to oil has any effect on mating, egg incubation, 
hatching success of the eggs, chick-rearing and the ability of the chicks to 
fly. 
</P>
<P>
The radio tags are not expected to have any effect on the pelicans and will be 
shed when the birds molt in July, Reetz said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, to establish a control group, the researchers will be tagging 20 
pelicans that had no exposure to oil and monitoring their behavior closely. 
</P>
<P>
Fry said the study is funded through September. He and the other biologists 
hope to locate the birds next year by the banding marks on their legs. 
</P>
<P>
Minerals Management Service Director Barry Williamson said the study "should 
contribute to our understanding of the short- and long-term effects of exposure 
to oil on sensitive species in the marine environment." His agency is 
contributing $50,000 to the study and Fish and Game is spending $17,000.

SUSPECT ARRESTED IN CONNECTION WITH 10 BALBOA ISLAND BURGLARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

NEWPORT BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Newport Beach man suspected of burglarizing at least 10 Balboa Island 
businesses over the past couple of weeks was arrested early Wednesday morning, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators, who had been staking out several locations along Marine Avenue, 
observed Wilbert B. Long Jr., 18, walking in a nearby alley and stopped him for 
questioning about 1 a.m. Wednesday, Newport Beach Lt. Tim Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on what the investigators found on him and his own statements, he was 
arrested in connection with at least 10 burglaries in the area," he said, 
adding that two nearby stores had been robbed just before Long's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Long is an unemployed construction worker who lives on the 300 block of Marine 
Avenue, where most of the burglaries occurred over the past couple of weeks, 
Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
Long was arrested on suspicion of burglary and was being held in Newport Beach 
City Jail on $10,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators suspect Long of entering small stores, primarily through windows, 
and stealing money from cash registers. Several hundreds of dollars have been 
stolen from the businesses, Newman said. Long was found with cash believed 
stolen from two stores on Agate Avenue just before his arrest, Newman said.

In these times of congestion and smog, random violence and runaway real estate 
prices, Wednesday served as one of those days that can reassure Southern 
Californians who have begun to fear that forsaking the Corn Belt was all a big 
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Consider this: In Denver, you would have awakened Wednesday to a foot of fresh 
snow. In Providence, R.I., they were hoping for a high of 27. In Chicago it had 
warmed up to 34 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
And in Santa Ana, skies were sunny and blue, with the high 72. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Klinger of Whittier didn't need a thermometer to measure the day. Perched 
on scaffolding on Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood along with three other 
construction workers, he was basking in the sunshine, watching the foot traffic 
below. 
</P>
<P>
Klinger, 42, was telling -- with relish -- the story of how he came to leave 
Chicago.

"I'll never forget the date," he said. "It was Jan. 1, 1985, and we had an 
80-below wind-chill factor. Broke the windshield out of my car. I made up my 
mind then I was going to California. I won't go back. Ever." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Kelly, 32, who was seated beside Klinger, nodded his head in agreement. 
He commutes two hours a day into Los Angeles but said, "It's days like this 
that make up for it. And it's days like this when everyone back East, where 
it's snowing, wants to move here. I ain't leaving." 
</P>
<P>
At a small park in Beverly Hills, Jim Reed of West Hollywood and Susan Brooks 
of Sherman Oaks were seated on a blanket, sharing a fortuitously planned picnic 
in the 70-plus-degree sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as we got in the Jeep (for lunch) I turned to Susan and said, 'You 
picked a perfect day,' " said Reed, 28, who works for a film production 
company. "Even gray skies can get you down when you live out here. The cold 
weather is hard to take. It makes people irritable out here." 
</P>
<P>
Reed left Springfield, Ill., seven years ago and doubts that he could ever 
return. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one thing to get stuck in the snow one day, but to scrape ice off your 
windshield every day . . . well, it's awful," he said. "I don't think I've ever 
scraped ice off my windshield here." 
</P>
<P>
At Mann's Chinese Theater, 19-year-old Sonja Huff was getting her first glimpse 
of Los Angeles. Back home in Roanoke, Va., it was rainy and cold. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually we're on our way to UCLA to pick up some admission papers," she said. 
"It's so nice to come into the sunshine. I never imagined California being this 
wonderful!" 
</P>
<P>
And the population grew by one. 
</P>
<P>
Yet not everything was so cheery in the sun. Tourist Hiroyuki Seki, 24, talked 
about the differences between Tokyo and Los Angeles, which he was visiting for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"I like L.A.," said Seki, obviously unfamiliar with the nuances of Randy 
Newman's civic anthem. "Little bit cold in Tokyo. I like L.A. But the other 
night I saw some people making a fight with a knife in a Jack in the Box. At 
night Tokyo is very quiet. Not so many sounds of policemen at night."

AFTER BIG VICTORY AT LEMOORE, SERVITE HAPPY TO BE AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
After traveling 220 miles for a first-round game in the Southern California 
Regional Division III basketball playoffs, Servite High School will be in its 
cozy gymnasium in Anaheim at 7:30 tonight to play Corona del Mar in the 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Servite (18-11) traveled to Lemoore, about 50 miles southwest of Fresno, for 
the opening round Tuesday night and held on for a 57-55 upset of the division's 
third-seeded team. 
</P>
<P>
The Friars won despite missing the front ends of three one-and-one free throw 
opportunities in the final 30 seconds. It also was missed free throws that cost 
Servite the Southern Section 3-AA division title, when the Friars made only 13 
of 27 in a 51-49 overtime loss to Estancia at the Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
The scene changes tonight to Servite's gym -- capacity: 950 -- where the Friars 
have won six of seven games this season, losing only to Bishop Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
Estancia Coach Tim O'Brien, whose team split with Corona del Mar in Sea View 
League play and beat Servite for the 3-AA title, called the game a tossup. 
</P>
<P>
"Servite has a size advantage, but Corona del Mar may be a little quicker," 
O'Brien said. "Servite gets a big plus playing on (its) own home court. It's 
going to be a low-scoring game. If either team scores over 50 points, it's a 
shocker. A four-point lead will be a big lead in this kind of a game. 
</P>
<P>
"Both teams have to feel fortunate to be where they're at after losing on 
last-second shots in the CIF (Southern Section) title games. Servite will have 
to start making its free throws in the clutch to beat a team like Corona." 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar (20-10) advanced with a 67-65 victory over second-seeded San 
Diego Lincoln as forward John Paulsen scored a season-high 30 points. Corona 
del Mar outscored Lincoln, 10-4, late in the fourth quarter to overcome a 57-55 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
In another Division III game: 
</P>
<P>
Dos Pueblos (17-13) at Estancia (21-9): Dos Pueblos finished tied for fourth in 
the Channel League and earned an at-large entry into the Southern Section 3-A 
playoffs. Dos Pueblos defeated Corona del Mar, 39-38, on a last-second shot by 
center Chris Gaines in the 3-A title game. Guard Ken Ardouin had 19 points in 
Dos Pueblos' 72-46 victory over San Diego University in the first regional 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Estancia overcame a flat first half to beat Tulare Western, 90-61, 
Tuesday. Estancia will be facing a height disadvantage but guard Agustin 
Heredia has been a force in his past three games, averaging 29 points. Estancia 
has made 46 of 55 free throws in its past two games. 
</P>
<P>
In Division I: 
</P>
<P>
Manual Arts (27-3) vs. Mater Dei (31-1) at Chapman College: Manual Arts won its 
first Los Angeles City Section title since 1981 with an 84-72 victory over 
Crenshaw in the title game. Guard Marcel Capers averages 16 points and 11 
assists a game and had 15 points in a 73-72 victory over Bakersfield in 
Tuesday's quarterfinals. William Celestine, a 6-5 senior center, averages 12 
rebounds and five blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei got its 23rd consecutive victory by beating North Hollywood, 76-64. 
Forward Andy Karich scored 26 points and made three three-point shots. Center 
Derek Stone has been hampered by an ankle injury but teammate Charlie Andres 
has picked up the slack, scoring 23 points and getting 14 rebounds in two 
games. Andres had 15 points and 14 rebounds in Mater Dei's victory over Loyola 
in the Southern Section 5-A title game. 
</P>
<P>
In Division IV: 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach (23-6) vs. Santa Clara (25-0) at Ventura College: Coach Ed Bowen 
led Laguna Beach to a 58-54 victory over Santa Clara 28 years ago for the 
Southern Section 1-A division title at Oxnard High. "They had won three 
straight 1-A titles when we went up there and beat them," Bowen said. "I'm 
revved up to play them again. I think they're as good as any team around, 
including Mater Dei." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara, behind forward Shon Tarver, has won 47 consecutive games since 
losing to Edison in the Estancia Tournament in December 1988. Laguna Beach 
guard John Trevino regained his shooting touch in a 71-37 victory over Coronado 
Tuesday, making five of eight three-point shots.

BREA-OLINDA GIRLS WOULD SEEM TO HAVE ALL THE ADVANTAGES

<P>
Defending Division III state champion Brea-Olinda retained its home-court 
advantage, but Orange County's other two first-round survivors -- La Quinta and 
Costa Mesa -- will be on the road when the Southern California Regional girls' 
basketball playoffs continue tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The winners of tonight's 7:30 games advance to the regional championships on 
Saturday at the Los Angeles Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
In Division II: 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta (28-2) at San Diego Point Loma (28-3): La Quinta is in for a tough 
game against top-seeded Point Loma, which has scoring balance, height, 
maturity, tradition and the home-court advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma has won a San Diego Section championship five times since 1984, 
including 1989 and '90. 
</P>
<P>
The current Pointers are averaging 56 points a game and holding opponents to 
27. They have won 14 consecutive games, including a 66-36 trouncing of West 
Torrance Tuesday night. La Quinta defeated West Torrance, 72-62, last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma has four starters averaging in double figures. Tyeast Brown, a 
6-foot center averages 22.3 points and 10 rebounds a game. Forward Ericka 
Crittenden (5-8) averages 13.5 points a game. Six-foot Robin Rabello is the 
leading rebounder (12 per game). She and 5-8 junior guard Stacy Wainwright 
average 10 points each. Claudine Neves (5-6) averages 4.2 points. 
</P>
<P>
In Division III: 
</P>
<P>
Lemoore (21-7) at Brea-Olinda (31-0): Lemoore, the Central Section Division III 
champion, is led by forwards Rachel Rossiter (14 ppg), the school's all-time 
leading scorer, and Amy Haire (13 ppg), who transferred to Lemoore this season. 
</P>
<P>
Rossiter is 5-9, Haire is 5-8. Ginger Thayer (5-11) is the tallest Tiger. The 
Lemoore backcourt -- Jennifer Cotta (5-6) and Dana Bezerra (5-2) -- must 
contend with the best backcourt in the state in Brea-Olinda's Aimee McDaniel, 
the defending Division Player of the Year, and Tammy Blackburn. 
</P>
<P>
The two, along with 6-foot post player Jody Anton and 5-9 center Jinelle 
Williams, average in double figures in scoring. Allison Bickell is the fifth 
starter. 
</P>
<P>
With a 19-point performance in Brea's first-round victory, McDaniel passed 
Carrie Eagan's total of 1,779 points to become the Lady Cats' all-time scoring 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Brea-Olinda has a 53-game winning streak, which should reach 54 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa (18-11) at Palos Verdes (27-5): Look for Costa Mesa's Cinderella 
season to run into serious trouble on the road. Palos Verdes is definitely the 
Mustangs' toughest, most talented opponent to date. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes came within 17 points of Brea-Olinda, 50-33, in the Southern 
Section 3-AA championship game. That doesn't sound like much, but it is the 
closest any nationally unranked team has come to Brea-Olinda since Channel 
Islands got within three points at the Santa Barbara Tournament of Champions in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes has the height advantage with 6-3 Monique Morehouse (11 ppg), 6-0 
Mary Maloney (9.9 ppg), 6-0 Kristen Jaconi and 5-10 Lisa Humphreys (15 ppg). At 
5-6, guard Susan Wilhite (10 ppg) is the shortest starter. Costa Mesa starts a 
5-10 forward, Rachel Ward (11 ppg), and four other players 5-9 or shorter. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa won its first Southern Section title (3-A) this season. The Mustangs 
are led by 5-9 freshman Olivia DiCamilli, who keeps coming through for them in 
the playoffs. Tuesday, she sank a turnaround jump shot at the buzzer to push 
Costa Mesa past its first-round opponent, Selma, 44-42.

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK; 
</P>
<P>
CENTERS MILLER, SRUBEK ARE ALIKE, BUT HAVE DIFFERENT PLAYING STYLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Simone Srubek is not used to what happened to her against Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Srubek is Fresno State's 6-foot-6 center, and one of the best shot blockers in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
But against the Titans, Srubek the blocker became Srubek the blockee. 
</P>
<P>
Genia Miller, Fullerton's 6-3 center, can send a shot back at Srubek. 
</P>
<P>
"That's some kind of thrill to block a 6-6 player's shot," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, that goes both ways. 
</P>
<P>
Srubek can also block Miller. 
</P>
<P>
"And I get mine blocked few and far between," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Srubek's Fresno State team and Miller's Fullerton team are all even after two 
games this season. Fresno State won the first; Fullerton won the second. The 
third is today, when the teams meet at 1 p.m. in the quarterfinals of the Big 
West Conference tournament at Long Beach Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Srubek has been at her best in the last part of the season. Her averages have 
risen to 21 points, eight rebounds and four blocked shots a game. And she has 
held her own against the conference's top players, including Nevada Las Vegas' 
Pauline Jordan and Hawaii's Judy Mosley. 
</P>
<P>
Miller also has played well, averaging 24 points, 12 rebounds and almost four 
blocks a game. And against Srubek, she has won the statistical battle. 
</P>
<P>
In the first game against Fullerton, a 74-59 Bulldog victory, Srubek had 24 
points, three rebounds and one block. Miller had 26 points, 15 rebounds, one 
lock and some foul trouble, finishing with four. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time we played Fresno, our outside shooting wasn't really that good, 
and I didn't score much either," Miller said. "The second time, we did much 
better." 
</P>
<P>
In the second game, a 68-60 Fullerton victory last week, Srubek had 20 points 
and four rebounds. Miller had 30 points, 12 rebounds and four blocks. Both 
players got into foul trouble, finishing with four each. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Srubek and Miller are similarly built, their games are very 
different. 
</P>
<P>
"Simone shoots very well from 15 feet out; Genia doesn't," said Maryalyce 
Jeremiah, Fullerton's coach. "But Genia has quickness and more moves at 
center." 
</P>
<P>
As long as they both are in the game, Srubek and Miller will be the focal point 
and to some extent, they will each limit the other's effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
But if either gets into foul trouble, the game will change. 
</P>
<P>
"If either one gets in foul trouble, it hurts the defense against the other," 
Jeremiah said. 
</P>
<P>
A victory will ensure a winning season for Fullerton (14-13, 9-9). Fresno State 
(18-10, 11-7) probably needs a victory to have a chance at a spot in the 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. tournament. The Bulldogs, who were the only 
Big West team to beat Nevada Las Vegas this season, hurt their chances with the 
loss to Fullerton last week. 
</P>
<P>
Words of support have started coming in for Dick Wolfe, coach of the 
fourth-ranked men's gymnastics team. Last week, Fullerton's athletics council 
recommended that men's gymnastics and men's and women's fencing be dropped 
because of department budget problems. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfe, who has coached at Fullerton the past 22 years, says he will try to 
raise money to fund the program and convince University President Jewel Plummer 
Cobb to reject the recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
Cobb says she is studying the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
At least one booster has written to Wolfe and Cobb, urging that the program be 
saved and promising to help raise funds. 
</P>
<P>
But athletic department officials say that even $100,000, roughly the program's 
annual budget, would not be sufficient. For the program to be saved, they said, 
it would need to be endowed, requiring gifts approaching $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
While the team's future hangs in the balance, the gymnasts have had their best 
performances of the year. They scored a 279.65 in a meet Friday at San Jose and 
came back with a 280.70 the next day at San Jose to raise their scoring average 
to 278.73, the fourth-highest in the country behind Nebraska, Minnesota, and 
Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to do well, and prove we deserve to stay," said Amir Kadury, a 
junior on the team. "We all believe Wolfe is capable of working it out. We're 
pretty confident our good program will stay." 
</P>
<P>
Eli Rodriguez, a senior, would not be affected if the program is discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my senior year, but that's not the point," he said. "I developed here as 
a student-athlete; I was provided an opportunity. I think other people ought to 
have that opportunity. A lot of the guys want to show we are a quality team. We 
don't have the budget most top 10 schools do. That just shows what we can do." 
</P>
<P>
A softball game was played recently between the Fullerton team and an alumni 
team -- or at least it looked like softball. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition game was played with a set of experimental rules being studied 
by a softball organization. 
</P>
<P>
Among the innovations, most of which are aimed at creating a game that is less 
biased toward pitching: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bases 70 feet apart instead of 60. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pitcher's mound 48 feet from home plate instead of 43. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ball 11 inches in diameter instead of 12. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Taking a lead off bases is permitted. 
</P>
<P>
"Our players liked it all," Coach Judi Garman said. "The ball was really hit 
hard a lot, and there were a lot of balls that got through the infield." 
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jill Matyuch, a senior guard on the women's basketball team, and quarterback 
Dan Speltz will be recognized as Fullerton's scholar-athletes of the year at a 
Big West Conference luncheon Friday. . . . Mate Borgogno's 13-game hitting 
streak ended against UCLA Tuesday when he went zero for four and struck out 
twice in the loss to the Bruins. . . . Meg Gallagher Sanders, who played for 
the Fullerton women's basketball team from 1981-85 and became an Olympic team 
handball player after watching the 1984 Olympic competition at Fullerton, is an 
assistant coach for the Fresno State women's basketball team.

Help-Wanted Index Drops: A key index monitoring advertising placed by companies 
seeking employees was down three points in January, compared to December, a 
nationwide survey by the Conference Board found. 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit research organization said its Help-Wanted Advertising index 
slipped to 146 in January from 149 in December. The monthly indicator is based 
on the help-wanted ad volume in 51 major U.S. newspapers. The index, set at 
100, monitors advertising volume in nine regions.

VIRATEK STOCK SCORES BIG GAIN IN HEAVY TRADING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

COSTA MESA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stock of Viratek Inc., battered recently by a dismal earnings report, 
climbed 71.4% Wednesday, making it the largest percentage gainer in the 
over-the-counter market. 
</P>
<P>
Viratek stock gained $1.875 to close at $4.50 on the national market. It was 
the second consecutive day for the company's stock to see heavy trading and be 
among those with the largest percentage gains. 
</P>
<P>
Company spokesman Jack Sholl was at a loss Wednesday to explain the day's 
stock-price rise. 
</P>
<P>
Securities analysts who follow the company were also uncertain of the reason 
behind the short-term price increase and the unusually high trading volume. 
During the day, 87,200 shares of Viratek were traded; the daily average for the 
stock is 26,500 shares. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts speculated that Wednesday's action could reflect action by 
investors to "cover their short positions." When investors take short 
positions, they borrow the stock and sell it at a high price, betting that the 
stock will fall and they will be able to buy it back for less. 
</P>
<P>
The volatility comes a week after Viratek's parent company, ICN Pharmaceuticals 
of Costa Mesa reported that it had ceased trying to win federal approval to 
market ribavirin for the treatment of early complications associated with 
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
A reflection of the import of its decision to give up the battle for a share of 
the potentially lucrative U.S. market for AIDS drugs is the fact that ICN took 
a $71-million writedown on its fourth quarter earnings. Most of that amount was 
related to ribavirin research and development. 
</P>
<P>
Another unfavorable signal to investors was Viratek's report last week that it 
lost $17.1 million on revenue of $2.6 million for 1989, contrasted with a loss 
of $6.3 million on revenue of $2.3 million for 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, Viratek's stock peaked at $15, far from the $98 high of 1986, 
when speculation over ribavirin's potential as an AIDS treatment was running at 
a fever pitch.

Phoenix will market DCM's IBM compatible personal computers and a new 
minicomputer based on the Intel 486 processor.

million. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix Group, a collection of small technology companies based in Irvine, last

Financially troubled Wang Laboratories Inc. will sell subsidiary InteCom Inc., 
a maker of communication switching systems, to the French electronics firm 
Matra S.A. for an undisclosed price. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds will further reduce the financially troubled computer company's debt 
and increase its cash, Wang officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We continue to make steady and deliberate progress in our program to sell 
non-strategic assets to eliminate Wang's debt to its bank group," said Richard 
W. Miller, president and chief operating officer, in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-February, Wang's bank debt totaled $308 million, spokesman Ed Pignone 
said. On Feb. 26, the company agreed to sell its international lease financing 
operations. This sale will reduce bank debt to $93 million, Pignone said.

Eight Orange County music groups and presenting organizations -- including a 
new chamber orchestra -- will play at the new Irvine Theatre during its 
inaugural 1990-91 season, theater general manager Douglas C. Rankin announced 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The organizations range from the new Irvine Chamber Orchestra, which will hold 
its first concert on March 19, 1991, to the UC Irvine Chamber Music Series, 
which has booked six dates beginning Nov. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Two groups -- Ami Porat's Mozart Camerata and John Larry Granger's South Coast 
Symphony -- also will give concerts in other venues (see related story, F2). 
</P>
<P>
The 750-seat Irvine Theatre, under construction on the UC Irvine campus, is 
scheduled to open in October. 
</P>
<P>
Several groups are abandoning other locations to play at the new venue, citing 
reasons ranging from the hall's size to its acoustics to its location. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Hickok, music director of the Irvine Camerata, said his group is leaving 
St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church in Newport Beach, after one season there. 
</P>
<P>
"The people at St. Andrew's are wonderful to work with," Hickok said Tuesday, 
"but we need our own home, and that's what the Irvine Theatre is going to be 
for us." Hickok also is dean of the School of Fine Arts at UCI. 
</P>
<P>
Micah Levy, music director of the 7-year-old Orange County Chamber Orchestra, 
is giving up two locations: St. Joseph Center on the Orange Campus of Loyola 
Marymount University, and South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"Attendance has been declining at St. Joseph's Center and increasing at SCR. I 
don't know why," Levy said Tuesday. "So we've decided to consolidate at the 
Irvine Theatre. . . . It's hard to say if we will lose people from North 
County. We certainly won't lose people from SCR. But we feel that the theater 
will be very important acoustically, and this should help us in terms of ticket 
sales and general support. It all works together." 
</P>
<P>
John Elg, an Irvine resident and music teacher who recently founded the Irvine 
Chamber Orchestra, which has yet to give a concert, believes the theater is "a 
nice size for a chamber group doing 20th-Century literature." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's realistic to think we could fill (3,000-seat) Segerstrom 
Hall doing contemporary music. Also, a new theater sparks a lot of interest in 
artists to see that certain things happen. But if this develops, I'm not 
opposed to doing run-out concerts in schools and churches." 
</P>
<P>
Groups, dates and repertory, where available, are:

It may not seem like it, but summer is fast approaching -- at least for day 
camp providers who are finalizing their programs this month. City-sponsored 
summer recreation information is usually mailed to residents in the early 
spring. Sign-ups take place between March and early June. 
</P>
<P>
Here are just a few of the myriad Orange County summer programs being planned 
for this year: 
</P>
<P>
* The Santa Ana Recreation and Community Services Agency will offer 6- to 
12-year-olds supervised care from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. The cost is $80 for each 
two-week session. Non-Santa Ana residents pay $120 for two weeks. Scholarships 
are available for families who cannot afford to pay. (714) 647-5301. 
</P>
<P>
* The West County Family YMCA in Huntington Beach also offers scholarships for 
its day camp and day-care programs. For day care, parents pay $66 weekly for 
supervised programs from 6:45 a.m. to 6 p.m. and children participate in 
low-cost activities like bowling and miniature golf. Day camp, with field trips 
to amusement parks, costs about $90 a week. (714) 847-9622. 
</P>
<P>
* Camp Frazier, on the site of the old Lion Country Safari park in Laguna 
Hills, provides day camp for 300 to 400 children daily during the summer. 
Activities include swimming at the Wild Rivers water park, which is on the Camp 
Frazier property, horseback riding, canoeing, fishing, lessons in karate, 
gymnastics and puppetry, and hiking. The cost is $150 a week for programs 
running from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. A minimum two-week sign-up is required. (714) 
837-1200. 
</P>
<P>
* Oceanside Aquatics Camp, for those who do not mind a long drive, draws 
participants from the East Coast and Europe as well as from Orange County and 
San Diego. Two-week sessions cost $110 and include instruction in surfing, body 
boarding and marine biology from experts, including some of the world's top 
competitive surfers. Although the beach program runs from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m., 
arrangements can be made for extended care. The surf camp has proved so popular 
that an adult version has been started. 
</P>
<P>
* The East Bluff Boys' and Girls' Club will have roller skating, bike riding, 
swimming, nature hikes through Newport's Back Bay and excursions on its summer 
day camp program. Cost is $85 a week. 
</P>
<P>
* Other sources for summer day care include private schools, preschools and 
public schools.

BRADLEY GOT ST. JOHN FUNDS, REINER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH CONNELL and TRACY WOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley received some of the funds allegedly stolen by Juanita St. 
John from a city-funded Africa trade task force, Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner said 
Wednesday as he announced the filing of theft charges against St. John. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner said investigators found that St. John, the task force executive 
director, used $31,000 of the organization's funds to cover payments to Bradley 
and others who were partners with her in a Riverside County real estate 
partnership. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said they found no evidence Bradley was aware that he had received 
task force funds. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said through a spokesman he had "no idea at all" that task force funds 
were deposited in the real estate partnership account. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors declined to say how much task force money was paid to Bradley, but 
the mayor's economic disclosure statements show Bradley reported receiving 
between $1,000 and $10,000 in 1987. Bradley's press spokesman, Bill Chandler, 
declined to give a more precise figure. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles city attorney's office, which has sued St. John to recover 
nearly $400,000 in allegedly misappropriated task force funds, said Wednesday 
it was reviewing whether it could seek repayment of the funds from Bradley and 
his partners. 
</P>
<P>
The revelation came Wednesday at a news conference as Reiner announced the 
filing of five counts of grand theft and filing false state tax returns against 
St. John. 
</P>
<P>
A longtime friend of Bradley, St. John has steadfastly maintained her 
innocence. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege St. John stole $180,000 from the nonprofit Task Force for 
Africa/Los Angeles Relations between 1985 and 1989. She also was charged with 
stealing $5,000 from a UCLA-based anti-genocide organization, International 
Alert, and filing false state tax returns in 1985, 1986 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The charges are the most significant criminal charges filed yet as an outgrowth 
of the year-old ethics and personal finances controversy that has engulfed the 
Bradley Administration. Bradley's ties to the task force, including his 
business relationship with St. John and St. John's hiring of Bradley's 
daughter, were investigated by City Atty. James K. Hahn last year. Hahn 
criticized Bradley's association and promotion of the task force, but said 
there was no evidence of criminal wrongdoing on the mayor's part. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner on Wednesday said St. John was the only person associated with the task 
force who appeared to be guilty of criminal misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
But he said Bradley and other city officials, including the City Council, must 
share responsibility for negligence in not safeguarding nearly $400,000 in 
public funds that were given to the task force. He noted that there were few 
controls on the city funds that were granted to St. John at Bradley's request. 
</P>
<P>
"About $100,000 a year was given over to one person to spend as she saw fit," 
Reiner said. "There was a great deal of neglect at all levels of the city." 
</P>
<P>
Reiner said St. John withdrew task force funds for personal expenses, including 
investments and payments on her heavily mortgaged San Marino home. 
</P>
<P>
Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for Reiner, said the Riverside partnership had 
sold two parcels of land and the funds were held in the partnership account, 
which was controlled by St. John. 
</P>
<P>
"The allegation is she spent that money," Gibbons said. "When it came time to 
pay the limited partners, she (used) task force funds." 
</P>
<P>
St. John, a 58-year-old San Marino resident, surrendered to Los Angeles police 
Wednesday morning and made a brief court appearance in the afternoon before 
being released on $10,000 bail. Stern-faced, St. John spoke only once -- when 
answering a procedural question from Judge Candace Beason -- and later avoided 
reporters when she was released on bail. A preliminary hearing was set for next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
St. John's newly retained attorney, Victor Sherman, told reporters outside the 
courtroom that his client "doesn't feel she has done anything wrong and she 
will be vindicated in court." 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Wednesday on an unrelated matter, Bradley refused to 
comment on St. John's legal troubles. "That's a matter that will be before the 
court," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
"Those charges have nothing to do with the task force or its long record of 
accomplishments in binding together the nations of Africa and helping with 
economic development there." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators say St. John has repeatedly refused to turn over records that 
would show how the city funds were used, but Sherman said she will be able to 
account for "every penny" of the task force expenditures. However, Sherman 
declined to discuss specifics, or say how the city money was used, saying he 
had not had time to review the financial records in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, who helped create the task force, attended meetings and kept it alive 
by pushing for city subsidies, has disclaimed responsibility for the group's 
financial troubles.

MAN AWARDED $1.3 MILLION IN JET CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN KENDALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first of dozens of wrongful death suits filed in the 1986 crash of an 
Aeromexico jetliner in Cerritos after a midair collision concluded in Los 
Angeles Federal Court on Wednesday with the award of more than $1.3 million in 
damages to a San Jose man whose wife and son were killed. 
</P>
<P>
After a two-day hearing, U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian ruled that Raul 
Leanos was entitled to $1,362,921 in the deaths of his wife, Elva, 42, and son, 
Raul, 13, in a crash that killed 82 people in the air and on the ground on Aug. 
31, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Elva Leanos and her son were returning from visiting relatives in Mexico aboard 
Aeromexico Flight 498, which was approaching Los Angeles International Airport 
shortly before noon, when the airliner was struck by a small plane. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been 3 1/2 years since the crash and finally cases are starting to get 
tried," said Los Angeles attorney Robert Stone, who represented Leanos. "My 
client is relieved that he's finally been able to have his day in court." 
</P>
<P>
If other federal judges follow the pattern of Tevrizian's award, plaintiff 
attorneys have estimated that it could eventually cost the U.S. government 
between $50 million and $100 million in damage judgments. 
</P>
<P>
The question of who was liable for the Cerritos crash was answered by jurors in 
April last year when they found in a Los Angeles trial that the Federal 
Aviation Administration and small plane pilot William K. Kramer, 53, were 
equally responsible. 
</P>
<P>
Aeromexico was absolved of any blame for the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Unless it is upset on appeal by federal prosecutors, the jury's liability 
verdict means that the U.S. government and Kramer's estate each must pay half 
of any damage awards. In practice, however, Kramer's $1.2-million estate would 
soon be depleted, leaving only the deep pockets of the taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
What Tevrizian's judgment seemed to mean to Leanos is that the San Jose man can 
expect to collect $762,921 from the federal government for the death of his 
wife and son. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear Wednesday whether the government might appeal the damage award 
to Leanos. 
</P>
<P>
But Stone said he understands federal attorneys are planning to appeal the jury 
verdict in last year's liability trial. U.S. Department of Justice Atty. Steven 
J. Riegel, who represented the federal government in the liability case, 
declined comment Wednesday.

SON CONVICTED IN THE 'NINJA MURDERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS TIMNICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stewart Woodman, one of two brothers charged with contracting for the 1985 
murder of their parents as the couple returned to their Brentwood home from a 
family gathering, was convicted Wednesday of first-degree murder and 
conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
After eight days of deliberations, a jury found the 40-year-old Hidden Hills 
man guilty in the slaying of Gerald and Vera Woodman, who were gunned down as 
they parked their Mercedes-Benz in the underground garage of their luxury 
condominium after attending a family dinner on Yom Kippur, the Jewish holy day 
of atonement. 
</P>
<P>
The slayings were dubbed the "Yom Kippur murders" or "Ninja murders," after an 
eyewitness apparently confused a hooded black sweat shirt worn by one of the 
killers with the type of clothing worn by Japan's legendary martial arts 
warriors. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner said prosecutors will seek the death 
penalty for Woodman and Anthony Majoy, 51, of Reseda, a lookout during the 
slayings, who was convicted on similar charges last week. The only other option 
open to the jury is life without possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
The penalty phase is set to begin March 21. 
</P>
<P>
Woodman was "devastated" by the verdicts, according to his attorney, Jay Jaffe. 
</P>
<P>
"He always knew, based on the circumstantial nature of the evidence, that this 
was a possibility. So in that way it doesn't come as a shock," he said, adding: 
"It doesn't make that hurt any less, though." 
</P>
<P>
Jaffe said the verdicts will be appealed, regardless of the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Woodman showed no emotion as the verdicts were read. But some of his relatives 
and friends who packed the courtroom left in tears as another chapter ended in 
the twisted family drama. 
</P>
<P>
One defense attorney, in closing arguments, had called the case a "play of the 
greatest human tragedy that I have ever had occasion to be part of." 
</P>
<P>
Woodman's wife of 19 years, Melody, said she was "dazed" and concerned for the 
couple's three children, the youngest of whom is 11. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a nightmare," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend that Stewart Woodman and his brother, Neil, 46, of Encino, 
hired former Westside attorney Robert Homick, 39, and his brother, former Los 
Angeles police officer Steven Homick, to carry out the killings. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Woodman and the Homicks are to be tried later this year. 
</P>
<P>
The motive allegedly was hatred for their successful father and a desire to 
cash in on their mother's $500,000 life insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
The family had been torn apart for years by a struggle for control of a 
Chatsworth plastics firm that pitted father and sons against each other, and 
resulted in several lawsuits and the sons' refusal to let Gerald and Vera 
Woodman see their grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
In closing arguments, Deputy Dist. Atty. John Zajec described the case as one 
of "hate and greed." 
</P>
<P>
"It's about how Stewart and Neil Woodman's hatred for their parents combined 
with their need to live like millionaires while trying to salvage their failing 
business led them to have their mother and father killed -- their mother for 
the insurance money, their father out of pure hatred." 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said one of the alleged killers stalked the couple for more than 
a year before striking. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses testified that Stewart Woodman made no secret of his hatred for his 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
However, Jaffe said the younger brother was guilty of nothing more than "trying 
to build his business too fast, associating with the wrong people, and saying 
things he never should have said." 
</P>
<P>
The defense claimed that the killers were hired by Neil Woodman. Steven Homick, 
49, the alleged triggerman, has already been sentenced to death in Nevada on 
his conviction for a triple murder in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Another suspect, alleged lookout Michael Dominguez, 30, of Las Vegas, pleaded 
guilty to two counts of first-degree murder and was sentenced to 25 years to 
life. Dominguez backed out of the deal he had made with prosecutors to testify 
against the other defendants. However, a videotape and transcripts of his 
preliminary hearing testimony were introduced as evidence in the 10-month-long 
trial.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: REWARD RISES TO $20,000 IN FATAL UCLA 
SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials at UCLA Medical Center have doubled the reward for information on 
last month's shooting that left one employee dead and another seriously 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
The center is now offering $20,000 for information leading to the arrest and 
conviction of the gunman who killed 22-year-old Diondra Picou on Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Another hospital worker, Nora Arellano, 30, suffered multiple gunshot wounds 
and was in fair condition Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide detective Andy Monsue said police have not received any calls on the 
case, but are pursuing several leads. "I think the key to the case lies in 
someone at the hospital and that's what we're trying to draw out," Monsue said. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information on the crime is asked to call Lt. Jim Kuehn of the UCLA 
Police at (213) 825-1793 or the LAPD at (213) 312-8401, or 312-8441 in the 
evenings.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COURT REFUSES TO HEAR MALIBU CITYHOOD 
APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a boost to Malibu cityhood supporters, a state appellate court on Wednesday 
refused to hear an appeal by county officials challenging the authority of a 
judge who has ordered the Board of Supervisors to set a June incorporation 
election by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs last week ordered the supervisors to comply 
with her January order that the county set the election. 
</P>
<P>
However, on Tuesday the supervisors ignored the order and had county lawyers 
ask the state Court of Appeal to overrule Janavs, contending that she did not 
have jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
Graham Ritchie, a lawyer for incorporation backers, said that he plans Monday 
to ask Janavs to cite the supervisors for contempt if they have not set the 
election. The judge is out of town this week. 
</P>
<P>
Ordinarily, Friday would be the last date supervisors could set the election 
and have the cityhood vote included on the June 5 ballot. However, Ritchie said 
he will ask Janavs to make an exception.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STATE REJECTS APPEAL FOR SPRAYING EXEMPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State agricultural officials on Wednesday turned down an appeal by Pomona Mayor 
Donna Smith to exempt her city from aerial spraying of malathion because of 
earthquake damage to roofs and chimneys in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Portions of Pomona are scheduled to be sprayed tonight as part of the state's 
Medfly eradication effort. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said she believes malathion could pose a health risk if it enters homes 
damaged in last week's Upland quake. 
</P>
<P>
State agricultural officials toured Pomona Wednesday afternoon and met with 
city officials before deciding to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Azusa, which, like Pasadena, has banned low-altitude formation 
flying, officials have asked for the use of a Pasadena police helicopter during 
spraying Friday. Pasadena officials agreed to fly an Azusa police officer into 
the spray zone, where the officer will inform state helicopter pilots of the 
city ordinance and inquire whether they intend to continue spraying.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OFF-DUTY OFFICER SHOOTS TRANSIENT TO DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An off-duty Culver City police officer shot and killed a transient who 
allegedly was threatening him with a belt early Wednesday in Hollywood, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred shortly before 2 a.m. in an underground garage on 
Hollywood Boulevard at North Sycamore Avenue, said Los Angeles Police Lt. 
Joseph Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
The Culver City officer, a 12-year veteran who was not otherwise identified, 
was returning to his parked vehicle when the transient tried to assault him 
with a belt that had a "large buckle,", according to Garcia. The officer, 
"repeatedly tried to avoid the unprovoked attack," said Garcia, before he drew 
his gun and fired once, striking the transient in the upper torso. 
</P>
<P>
The wounded man was pronounced dead at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. His name 
was withheld pending notification of relatives. The case will be investigated 
by LAPD detectives.

FUGITIVE'S CASE IS DISMISSED BY U.S. MAGISTRATE; 
</P>
<P>
COURT: OFFICIAL REFUSES ITALIAN GOVERNMENT'S REQUEST FOR EXTRADITION, CALLING 
THE PROCEEDING 'A MESS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A U.S. magistrate in Los Angeles on Wednesday dismissed Italy's extradition 
case against fugitive Pasquale Valitutti, a self-described anarchist who was 
convicted in absentia a decade ago in connection with an attempted terrorist 
kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just such a mess," said Magistrate John Kronenberg in ruling that a 
complex package of extradition documents had not been presented correctly to 
the court by the Italian government. "We're wasting just too much court time on 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Valitutti, 43, a lumbering man whose bear-like appearance is accented by a full 
beard, "started to cry" when Kronenberg threw out the extradition request, 
according to his court interpreter who was sitting beside him at the defense 
table. 
</P>
<P>
Valitutti is considered more than just a fugitive in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
On the evening of Dec. 15, 1969, another anarchist, Giuseppe Pinelli, fell to 
his death from a fourth-floor window at Milan police headquarters. Police later 
said he leaped to his death. But Valitutti, a Milan schoolteacher, was himself 
being interrogated across the hall. He later told journalists that he heard 
scuffling noises from the room where Pinelli was being questioned, suggesting 
that Pinelli's fall may not have been by choice. 
</P>
<P>
Pinelli's death created a sensation and sparked Italian writer Dario Fo's 
popular play, "Accidental Death of an Anarchist." 
</P>
<P>
Valitutti has been held at the federal Metropolitan Detention Center in 
downtown Los Angeles since last November, when he was arrested at Los Angeles 
International Airport after living for a decade undetected in France. 
</P>
<P>
The government prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Atty. Martin J. Murphy, indicated 
that he would have to await word from the U.S. Justice Department on whether 
Washington -- conferring with the Italian government -- wanted to refile the 
extradition case. There is no double jeopardy in extradition matters, meaning 
the extradition case can be brought more than once. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. immigration officials have placed a hold on Valitutti so that he cannot 
walk out of prison a free man in the United States. Should the Justice 
Department decide to drop the case, he would be put on a plane and flown out of 
the country -- but not to Italy, according to federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
Valitutti's life in exile, according to his his wife, Carla, was spent 
traveling the world buying "arts and crafts" and selling them through his 
business in France. What made the fugitive's life style even more remarkable 
was that he lived and traveled under his own name, she said. 
</P>
<P>
His luck ran out at Los Angeles International Airport last November when a 
computer check by an immigration inspector turned up the fact that he was 
wanted by Italian authorities and Interpol, the international police agency. 
</P>
<P>
Valitutti's criminal conviction stemmed from the attempted kidnaping in 
Florence of the son of an industrialist in October, 1977. It was botched after 
a police chase and shoot-out. Italian authorities contended that Valitutti was 
one of four terrorists who participated in the kidnaping conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
Valitutti was sentenced to four years in prison, and served eight months in a 
prison hospital where he almost died during a hunger strike. Then, in 1980, 
while out on bail, he fled the country. By 1981, an Italian presidential decree 
knocked three more years off his sentence -- leaving only four months for him 
to serve. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Valitutti's Los Angeles attorney, David E. Wood, said in court 
that under the extradition treaty between Washington and Italy, a person facing 
less than six months prison time cannot be extradited. A second Valitutti 
conviction in Milan in 1977 for founding a criminal revolutionary organization 
was never an extradition issue, Wood argued. 
</P>
<P>
Valitutti, who was returned to his cell Wednesday afternoon, told Wood that he 
was sure he could return to Italy without fear of being thrown back in prison 
for earlier criminal convictions if he renounced his anarchist convictions. But 
Wood said his client stood firm on his political principles. 
</P>
<P>
"I refuse to do that because it's more important to have a conscience than a 
body," Valitutti told Wood.

$75.5-MILLION GLITZ; 
</P>
<P>
UNDAUNTED, BEVERLY HILLS PUSHES ON WITH CIVIC CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Although appalled at the price of finishing a project that few other cities 
would dare to dream of, the Beverly Hills City Council has told its general 
contractor to go back to work on a police station, library and outdoor 
courtyard that could end up costing as much as $75.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The final tab remained unknown after the 5-0 vote Tuesday night because the two 
sides agreed to set aside for now the $14.5-million payment dispute that caused 
the J.A. Jones Construction Co. to pull its workers off the job in mid-January. 
</P>
<P>
But it is clear that the city will have to pay somewhere between $9 million and 
$22.5 million more than it planned to complete the final phase of its new Civic 
Center, which has been rising along Santa Monica Boulevard for the last seven 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The money is there, secured by a 30-year mortgage on the Civic Center itself, 
but City Council members said that other projects may have to be dropped in 
order to finish the last 10% of the work on the police and library complex. 
</P>
<P>
The financing was arranged by selling $116 million worth of $5,000 certificates 
of participation, a form of revenue bond that does not require approval by the 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
While calling the situation "a financial tragedy," Vice Mayor Allan L. 
Alexander said it was in the best interests of the city to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by architect Charles Moore, the Civic Center already includes an 
$11-million firehouse and a $9-million parking garage with room for 553 cars. 
Both are in use, and work is almost finished on an $11-million renovation of 
the 59-year-old City Hall, complete with a new coat of gold leaf for the knob 
atop the cupola. 
</P>
<P>
It was to be a civic center for the ages. Moore's design, inspired in part by 
Italian architect Francesco Borromini's plans for a 17th-Century Roman palazzo, 
includes an elliptical colonnade with soaring concrete arches, linking the City 
Hall and firehouse on the west side of Rexford Drive with the police station, 
parking garage and library on the east side. When completed, the center will 
total nearly 600,000 square feet. The old police station, cramped and dingy, 
will be replaced by a command center more in keeping with the image of the 
"Beverly Hills Cop" movies. 
</P>
<P>
In the City Council chambers, which once seated 80, there will be room for 130 
spectators, and a two-way audio-visual system will allow as many as 400 people 
to take part in public hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Even the parking garage was designed to the nth degree, with a spring-loaded 
"stainless steel cable system for vehicular restraint" -- for use on the ramps 
between levels, instead of concrete walls, to improve visibility. But that 
feature proved to be impossible to build and had to be replaced with a simpler 
array of galvanized iron cables. 
</P>
<P>
The entire project was priced at about $30 million when Moore submitted his 
original design, a sum that could have been paid out in cash at that time, 
according to a 1982 staff report. 
</P>
<P>
But it now appears that the price tag could read more than $100 million, 
despite a 1986 decision to cut costs by dropping an auditorium and cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to serve the people for the next 100 years," Mayor Max Salter said 
last year, describing the complex as "overbuilt somewhat," but arguing that 
"quality is remembered long after cost is forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, Salter seems as fed up with it as his colleagues. Moore's soaring 
arches "should've been in the Vatican," he said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
One apparent victim of the imbroglio is veteran City Manager Edward S. Kreins, 
who announced his retirement shortly after the cost overruns became known in 
January. Mark Scott, his successor, will take over March 31. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members have said little in public about Kreins' departure, but 
bitterness over his role surfaced Tuesday when a motion was offered to delete a 
phrase praising his efforts on the Civic Center. It failed by just one vote. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure there are errors on the part of the city. No one is free of guilt," 
Salter said in closing the debate, but his voice rose in exasperation as he 
blasted the Jones company for failing to alert the City Council about the 
rising costs. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferson Welch, Jones' West Coast representative, said the North 
Carolina-based firm kept the city informed through JLH Consulting Inc., a 
construction management company that reported to the city staff. JLH was 
recently replaced by a new firm, the city's third construction manager since 
the job began. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as November, city staffers assured the council that all was well 
and that it would cost no more than $53 million to build the police station, 
library and courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
With that memory still fresh, "the (new) cap of $75.5 million (for the final 
phase) is really an appalling figure," Councilwoman Vicki Reynolds said. "It's 
almost too much to bear, but that's where we are and we have to go forward." 
</P>
<P>
The city, which already has paid Jones just under $53 million, will now pay the 
contractor $2 million to settle existing claims by its electrical, mechanical 
and drywall subcontractors. It will then pay Jones $7 million more as the work 
proceeds, with the police station scheduled for completion in two months. The 
final stage, an outdoor area known as the boat court, is to be finished in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides reserved the right to seek arbitration or go to court to settle 
their outstanding claims, but they agreed that the final cost will not exceed 
$75.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Jones also agreed to open its books for an audit by the city. 
</P>
<P>
Welch, Jones' West Coast representative, said the overruns reflected "a fairly 
large number of changes made by the city" and several unanticipated problems, 
including asbestos removal in the old library, ground water under the police 
station, the departure of key designers and adjustments for the elimination of 
the theater. 
</P>
<P>
But City Atty. Greg Stepanacich said the city is not responsible for Jones' 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the dispute at this point," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other headaches remain, including suits filed by subcontractors left out of 
this week's agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Spencer Graffam, vice president of Tucson, Ariz.-based Harshbarger Industries, 
which did much of the steel work on the project, said his firm is suing Jones 
and the city for more than $3 million in damages caused by changes and delays.

PASADENA IS HOPING TO PRIME PUMP FOR DEVIL'S GATE FACE LIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pasadena officials pushing for an ambitious restoration of the desolate Devil's 
Gate area at the craggy base of the San Gabriel Mountains are betting $1 
million that they can interest other government agencies in the project. 
</P>
<P>
The city has approved that amount for engineering, recreational and economic 
studies of the project this year, hoping the results will prompt other 
government agencies to make the first significant contributions to the 
$80-million to $90-million restoration plan, which has been in the planning 
phase for years. The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California has 
already pledged to reimburse the city up to $200,000 for the studies. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas K. Underbrink, the city's water engineering manager and director of the 
Devil's Gate project, said renewed interest has come in recent months from the 
MWD, the U.S. Forest Service and the Los Angeles County Department of Public 
Works. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is working on Devil's Gate now, said Ernie Messner, a Pasadena 
attorney who heads the city's advisory committee on the project. "Two and a 
half years ago, the county (flood control officials) didn't even want to talk 
about it. Now they've taken a real interest." 
</P>
<P>
Centered on the Devil's Gate Dam at the northern end of the Arroyo Seco, the 
project embodies the vision of city officials and local environmentalists who 
want to resuscitate 250 acres of long-neglected landscape in northwest 
Pasadena. Devil's Gate partisans attribute its decline to the silt- and 
debris-filled dam and to years of neglect and environmental abuse by the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Plans developed over the past several years call for extensive work on the 
arroyo's northern end, above Devil's Gate Dam, near the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory and just north of the Foothill (210) Freeway. The project, which 
would be funded through a variety of public and private sources, would 
incorporate improvements in flood control combined with water conservation, 
wildlife habitat restoration and recreation. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is to restore the canyon to its long-lost pastoral glory, one whose 
beauty inspired Pasadena's Arts and Crafts intellectual, artistic and 
architectural movement at the turn of the century. Plans call for extensive 
improvements in biking, hiking and equestrian trails, and the creation of a 
small, stocked fishing pond. Oak Grove Park, a county-operated park on city 
land west of the dam, would be included in the larger Devil's Gate landscape. 
</P>
<P>
Underbrink and Deputy City Manager Edward Aghjayan maintain that, even if 
Pasadena does not manage to interest other agencies in picking up part of the 
tab, its Water and Power Department has sufficient capital improvement funds to 
do some of the work. The exact amount of money required will be determined in 
the economic study now under way. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of who pays for it, the biggest incentive for restoring the area 
would come in the form of millions of dollars in water profits from expanding 
the area's natural aquifer into a massive water storage facility. Aghjayan said 
the city could earn $7 million in revenues annually from the water storage -- 
enough to recoup much of the cost of the restoration project in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
If other agencies helped fund the project, they could share in the profits, 
Underbrink said. 
</P>
<P>
Although it has yet to appropriate any large sums of money for the restoration, 
there is support for the project on the city's Board of Directors, City 
Director Rick Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
A multi-jurisdictional agency to oversee the project could be formed within the 
next year, Underbrink said. 
</P>
<P>
Cole said he and City Manager Donald McIntyre plan to bicycle to Devil's Gate 
this weekend with other city officials to take a look at the area's potential. 
</P>
<P>
"It's finally reached a critical mass now," Cole said. "It was kind of a dreamy 
idea five years ago, and now it's turning into an increasingly compelling 
imperative." 
</P>
<P>
One of the first tasks will be to clean up the area's four contaminated wells. 
Work on the decontamination, funded partly by JPL under a recent agreement with 
the city, is set to begin this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Officials propose that, once water pollution cleanup efforts are completed in 
the next few years, the Devil's Gate underground aquifer can be used as a vast 
storage area. Rain runoff and water imported from Northern California and the 
Colorado River would be directed underground and as much as 400,000 acre-feet 
of water -- worth $50 million at today's wholesale winter rates -- would be 
stored there and then distributed to water suppliers throughout the region.

DRUNK DRIVER WHO KILLED 4 IN GLENDALE GETS 11 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Glendale man convicted of killing two women and their two daughters while 
driving drunk was sentenced Wednesday to 11 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena Superior Court Judge Carol J. Fieldhouse sentenced William Conway, 28, 
after hearing the victim's relatives ask for the maximum term and the defense 
attorney read a letter from Conway pleading for leniency. 
</P>
<P>
His voice cracking at times, Fieldhouse told the hushed courtroom that the 
sentence was the harshest he felt that state law would allow. He said he felt 
"almost as sorry for the defendant and his plight as for the survivors of the 
victims." 
</P>
<P>
"Bill, listen to me," the judge told Conway. "If you're feeling put upon, if 
you're feeling badly treated . . . you'll see it's one year out of your life 
for each life you took." 
</P>
<P>
Fieldhouse said Conway could be eligible for parole in four years. 
</P>
<P>
"What you can do when you return . . . is, if you're a passenger in a car . . . 
with a girlfriend or a buddy, and they drink and get behind the wheel and you 
stop them . . . then those people won't have died for nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Conway, a former Glendale parks and recreation worker, was convicted Feb. 7 of 
four counts of gross vehicular manslaughter and two counts of causing an 
accident with injuries while driving under the influence of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. James Rogan successfully argued that Conway was legally 
drunk and driving nearly 80 miles an hour on July 13, 1988, when he hit five 
pedestrians waiting on a traffic island to cross Verdugo Road in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Carr, 36, and her daughter, Caren, 6, and Valerie Cramer, 32, and her 
daughter, Brianna, 9, were killed. Billy Cramer, now 13, was able to dive out 
of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Conway could have received a maximum term of 15 years. Fieldhouse gave him 719 
days credit for time spent in jail and under house arrest at his mother's 
Glendale home, which reduces the 11-year sentence to about nine years. 
</P>
<P>
The victims' families called the sentence fair. 
</P>
<P>
"By today's standards, that's the best we can hope for," said Patrick Carr, who 
had earlier told Fieldhouse that even a maximum term would be "little 
consolation." 
</P>
<P>
Before the sentencing, Public Defender Michael Allensworth, who asked 
Fieldhouse to "temper justice with mercy," read a letter Conway had written to 
the judge. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel ashamed and sick inside," Allensworth read from the letter, his voice 
cracking and drawing tears from Conway's family members and onlookers. "I am so 
very sorry. I love children so much that I would gladly give my life for those 
taken." 
</P>
<P>
During a break in the proceedings, Conway hugged family and friends at the back 
of the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill is wonderful," said a tearful Felicia Herbstreith, a friend of Conway's 
sister, Louise. "He's taken care of my kids many times." 
</P>
<P>
But the victims' families told Fieldhouse they wanted Conway to serve as an 
example. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been few things in my life that have given me as much joy as my 
marriage to Valerie, and my daughter Brianna. Not too long ago, everything was 
going our way," said William Cramer, who sat on the witness stand and read in a 
flat, unemotional voice a letter he had written to the judge. 
</P>
<P>
"But my life was shattered in seconds by a thoughtless, drunken stranger," he 
said. "I resent Mr. Conway. He took away a piece of my heart, something I can 
never get back. As the gray cloud is lifted and we go forward. . . . I would 
like to know that Mr. Conway's life is changed."

<P>
According to the Department of Fair Employment and Housing, California law 
prohibits discrimination in employment if such discrimination is based on race, 
national origin, color, religion, sex, physical handicap, marital status or 
age. 
</P>
<P>
The category of sex is broken down into cases of discrimination based on 
gender, sexual harassment, loss of job due to pregnancy and sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
It has been, during the last two years, by far the most frequently-mentioned 
category in these complaints. 
</P>
<P>
The FEH records draw a distinction between cases of race/color and national 
origin/ancestry; the latter are not shown here because one category may 
fine-tune the other but for the most part they duplicate each other. 
</P>
<P>
Retaliation (defined, for example, as being fired or being denied employment 
benefits for filing complaints against an employer) is not shown here as a 
category because it duplicates cases of discrimination on the basis of race or 
sex.

<P>
No one would exactly call him the Donald Trump of the 19th Century -- much to 
his dismay. But Columbus Tustin did all right in the end, though he didn't 
think so. 
</P>
<P>
With dreams of grandeur, Tustin and business partner Nelson O. Stafford left 
the San Francisco Bay area in 1868 and headed south to speculate on real 
estate. For what would be considered a paltry down payment on a home in Orange 
County today (roughly $20,000), Tustin and Stafford bought 1,359 acres of land 
from the old Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana estate. 
</P>
<P>
The following year, the two partners split. Stafford took the western 520 acres 
and Tustin was deeded sole ownership of the eastern 839 acres. The Northern 
California transplant was finally able to put all his energy, hopes and desire 
into building his dream -- Tustin City. He envisioned it as a bustling 
metropolis that would be the hub of an embryonic Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin mapped out his city-to-be with the precision of a mathematician tackling 
a complex algebra problem. He cut his fledgling metropolis into blocks of 300 
square feet. The major thoroughfare was Main Street, and the north-south roads 
were letters of the alphabet, while the east-west roads were numbered. 
</P>
<P>
Once the blueprint was made, the next step was to draw people to populate the 
city. With the promotional savvy of a P.T. Barnum, Tustin sweetened the deal 
with an enticement of free lots to any adventurous settlers who would build on 
the subdivided 50-by-150-foot parcels; he generously offered an entire block 
for a family with four or more children. Anyone who would start a church would 
receive $100. 
</P>
<P>
By 1872, Tustin's dream was starting to take shape. There were enough people to 
start a school and to establish a commercial district; Dr. William Burgess Wall 
initiated the citrus industry when he planted his orchards in 1875. During the 
next few years the community grew, until eventually Tustin felt poised to kick 
his little town into a big city. The key, he thought, was the Southern Pacific 
Railroad. But his dream was not to be. 
</P>
<P>
When the dust settled in 1878 after a fierce winner-take-all battle between 
Tustin and Santa Ana for a train station, Santa Ana emerged victorious when 
Tustin couldn't match the subsidy the railroad demanded. Santa Ana became the 
bustling metropolis, Tustin City was the bridesmaid, and Columbus died a 
frustrated, bitter man four years later. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin never knew that while he had reached for the moon, he had still managed 
to land in the stars. In the decade following his death, the little town he 
founded prospered. By the turn of the century it boasted the L. Utt Pioneer 
Store, the Bank of Tustin, a doctor's office, a horse-drawn streetcar, a 
burgeoning citrus industry and the Tustin Water Works. In 1888, the Southern 
Pacific Railroad did indeed establish a terminal there. 
</P>
<P>
It may not have been the evolution Tustin had hoped for, but his little village 
had assumed its own identity -- as a simple, honest, agricultural community. It 
was that identity -- along with the natural artesian wells, a mild climate, 
scenic mountains and the rich soil -- that attracted a lot of folks from 
Northern California and the Midwest who just wanted to be good farmers and good 
neighbors. The city attracted a lot of migrant workers from Mexico for the same 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, to underscore just how progressive Tustin was, migrant farm workers 
studied in school alongside the offspring of the landowners, as evidenced by a 
class picture of 1905 displayed in the Tustin Area Museum, a centerpiece of the 
Tustin Historical District. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a number of Mexican children who attended Tustin School," says 
Carol Jordan, a historian and curator of the museum. "The schools were well 
integrated from the beginning. And when the children couldn't come to school, 
the teachers would conduct class in the walnut and apricot orchards." 
</P>
<P>
Today the Historical District neighborhood still maintains that ethnic balance 
and harmony. It has also managed to retain a small-town atmosphere, despite the 
post-war land boom. It is the third-oldest city in the county, and the 
neighborhood reflects a certain pride in its heritage. Most of the original 
trees and foliage remain, along with a lot of the original homes. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those original homes include those of heavyweight financier David Hewes 
(formerly of San Francisco). His house still stands today at 350 South B St. 
Hewes' best friends were railroad tycoons Leland Stanford and Henry Huntington, 
so it is no wonder he was able to donate the golden spike that marked the 
joining of the transcontinental railroad. He and his wife were instrumental in 
building the Tustin Presbyterian Church, which still holds services. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman Stevens, with partners James Irvine and Ed Utt, owner of the Utt Juice 
Co., developed 1,000 acres on the Irvine Ranch. Stevens' ornate Victorian-style 
home at 228 W. Main St. has been designated a historical landmark, and is the 
star of an office complex that strives to preserve the architectural integrity 
of the neighborhood's earlier days. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, "Olde Tustin," as the neighborhood is also called, is an area with 
abundant historical residences and commercial buildings of all kinds. An 
afternoon stroll through the shaded streets provides a glimpse into the past 
and the well-preserved dreams of the neighborhood's forefathers.

THE DEATH OF HANK GATHERS;

GATHERS TOUCHED THOSE WHO KNEW HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I enjoy the writings of Mike Downey and often find his work very humorous. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, I was deeply moved by Mike's piece and found it difficult to finish 
reading it. 
</P>
<P>
My younger brother, Paul, a student at Santa Clara University, was so amazed by 
Hank Gathers' performances that he nicknamed him "F-Gathers," as in an F-4 
fighter jet. I used to like that nickname, but we'll use it no more. Our 
fighter has been shot down. 
</P>
<P>
We will all miss Hank the basketball player, but mostly we will miss Hank the 
person.

Quake damage -- An article on Jan. 18 incorrectly quoted Santa Barbara 
structural engineer Stanley H. Mendes as saying that most unreinforced masonry 
buildings in Ventura could not withstand a major earthquake even if 
strengthened to meet building code standards. In a speech, Mendes said "many" 
buildings would require demolition after a large earthquake of long duration.

ANTELOPE DISTRICT MINORITY PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times staff and wire service reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Antelope Valley Union High School District, faced with a 30% minority 
student enrollment that continues to grow, has approved an affirmative action 
plan aimed at increasing the district's relatively small number of minority 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in the nearly 10,000-student district said the goal of the plan is to 
hire 19 additional minority teachers in each of the coming three years. 
</P>
<P>
The district said the hiring plan should increase the percentage of minority 
teachers in the district from 8.9% to 16.4% by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
District officials acknowledged that the plan will not bring about parity in 
the ethnic makeup of students and teachers any time soon, in part because 
minority student enrollments are expected to continue increasing and because 
minority teaching candidates are in demand by urban school districts. 
</P>
<P>
The affirmative action plan was approved unanimously Wednesday night by the 
district's Board of Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos, who make up 17.8% of the students, are the fastest-growing minority 
group in the district, increasing nearly 32% since last year. Black students 
now represent 8.4% of the enrollment, a 17% increase from last year. Asians 
account for 2.4% of the students, up 26.6% over last year. The percentage of 
white students declined to 69.6% this year.

24-HOUR ULTIMATUM TO RAIDERS; 
</P>
<P>
OAKLAND THREATENS TO CALL IT OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Oakland authorities have given Raiders owner Al Davis until the end of the day 
Friday to say whether he will return the team to Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
If Davis doesn't say yes, a meeting Monday at which the City Council and the 
Alameda County Board of Supervisors were supposed to formally approve the deal 
will be canceled, the chairman of the Alameda board, Don Perata, said today. 
</P>
<P>
Perata added that if the meeting is canceled, he believes the Oakland offer to 
the Raiders will be dead, leaving Davis negotiating only with Los Angeles 
Coliseum representatives on future playing arrangements for his team. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that I will receive the assurances that I have asked for, that 
(Mayor Lionel Wilson) has asked for, which will allow us to go into the Monday 
night meeting with the knowledge and assurance that if we vote to return the 
Raiders . . . we will have a deal," Perata said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is now coming down to just a single word answer from Mr. Davis, yes or no," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Raider offices in El Segundo, Davis had no public comment. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a representative of the Los Angeles Coliseum private management team 
that has been trying to reach agreement with Davis on a plan to keep the team 
in Los Angeles reported little progress in a negotiating session Wednesday 
night with Davis. 
</P>
<P>
The representative, Irving Azoff, said that Ed Snider, head of Spectacor 
Management Group and the lead negotiator for the Coliseum private managers, 
continues to have the impression that Los Angeles has more time to barter. 
</P>
<P>
This may be, Perata said today in an interview, but if Los Angeles does, it 
will mean that the Oakland deal is off. 
</P>
<P>
Perata said Oakland authorities are determined that they not be placed in the 
position Sacramento officials found themselves in after approving partial city 
financing of an offer to move the Raiders there, only to have months pass 
without any word from Davis whether he intended to go there. 
</P>
<P>
The Sacramento City Council voted to let the city's offer expire last week. 
</P>
<P>
Perata said that Oakland authorities notified Davis of their Friday deadline at 
a closed-door meeting with him in Oakland Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I very clearly set forth for Davis our timetable and why we considered it 
irrevocable," he said. "He understood it. He said he understood our position." 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland offer -- including a franchise fee to be paid the team, guarantees 
of $28 million a year in ticket revenues, other fees and $53.5 million to 
expand the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum -- totals $660 million. City 
officials notified Davis this week, however, that $53.5 million might not be 
enough to fully finance the projected stadium expansion, and they asked the 
Raiders to agree to pay the rest of the costs, estimated at up to $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles offer to Davis reportedly includes about $70 million in a 
franchise fee, and guarantees a new or renovated Los Angeles Coliseum and an 
undisclosed slice of revenues from luxury boxes and club seating to be 
constructed at the Coliseum.

THATCHER CONDEMNS TAX VIOLENCE

<P>
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher today condemned violence during 
weeklong protests against an imminent new poll tax but faced more angry scenes 
as she began a three-day visit to Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Parliament, Thatcher said violence at town halls across England is 
"a negation of democracy." 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of people have been arrested as angry crowds fought with police and 
invaded council chambers in a growing wave of protest as municipal authorities 
met to set the new tax's local level. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher, whose waning popularity has been linked directly to the new tax, said 
the violence has been organized by left-wing extremists for their own political 
ends. She also attacked 28 opposition Labor Party members of Parliament who 
have called on people to break the law and not pay the tax. 
</P>
<P>
The prime minister was answering questions shortly before flying to Scotland, 
where anti-tax campaigners threatened demonstrations throughout her visit. 
</P>
<P>
The tax, which comes into force in England and Wales on April 1, will finance 
local services by replacing property taxes with a personal charge on all people 
of voting age. About 20 million non-property owners will be paying as much as 
$810 a head toward local services for the first time.

W. GERMANY URGES SECURE POLISH BORDER

The West German Parliament today adopted a resolution calling for a united 
Germany to honor Poland's western border after a raucous debate marked by 
charges that Chancellor Helmut Kohl had endangered the unification process. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution states that the two Germanys should adopt identical declarations 
saying, "The Polish people are assured that their right to live in secure 
borders will not be questioned by us Germans through territorial claims either 
now or in the future." 
</P>
<P>
It further says that the future government of a united Germany should sign a 
border treaty on the basis of those declarations. 
</P>
<P>
After the Parliament session, Kohl traveled to Brussels to meet with NATO 
allies. He said he reassured them that their concerns will be considered in the 
drive to reunify the two Germanys. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody has to be concerned that the Germans would one way or the other want to 
go it alone," he told reporters after a nearly three-hour meeting at the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl had come under fire abroad and at home for his previous reluctance to 
unequivocally state that a united Germany would never lay claim to land ceded 
to Poland after the Third Reich's 1945 defeat. 
</P>
<P>
In Parliament today, one lawmaker from the opposition Social Democrats, Juergen 
Schmude, said Kohl's handling of the border issue had amounted to "political 
arson in the European house." 
</P>
<P>
Kohl, apparently trying to avoid offending conservative voters before federal 
elections in December, had insisted that only the government of a united 
Germany could address the matter. 
</P>
<P>
His subsequent demand that a border treaty be linked to Polish concessions also 
caused an uproar, and he withdrew it earlier this week, at the same time 
proposing the resolution passed today. 
</P>
<P>
In today's parliamentary debate, the opposition Social Democrats charged that 
Kohl's pronouncements had seriously endangered the unification process. 
</P>
<P>
Party chief Hans-Jochen Vogel said "seldom has a federal chancellor . . . so 
mishandled" his responsibilities to West Germans "as Chancellor Kohl in the 
last days and weeks." 
</P>
<P>
In his own address, Kohl battled back by pointing out the Social Democrats' 
contacts with East Germany's now-disgraced Communist Party in past years. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl also seemed to address concerns by Moscow that he is trying to make 
unification occur too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"We are producing no artificial time pressures in order to speed up 
unification," said Kohl.

SNOWSTORM HEADS EAST, TURNS TO ICE;

WEATHER: COLORADO AND WYOMING DIG OUT. ROADS IN UPPER MIDWEST BECOME ICE RINKS;

A storm that buried parts of Colorado and Wyoming under four feet of snow 
turned into freezing rain as it moved eastward, snapping power lines and 
turning roadways into ice rinks. Half the homes in Des Moines, Iowa, were 
without power today. 
</P>
<P>
The snow cleanup was expected to get easier today with temperatures soaring as 
high as the 50s. 
</P>
<P>
"When you step off the curb, you're probably going to step into a slush pile," 
Craig Sanders, forecaster for the National Weather Service, said in Cheyenne, 
Wyo. 
</P>
<P>
About 130 miles of interstate highway remained closed in Wyoming early today as 
crews tried to clear snowdrifts and abandoned cars. The storm dumped up to 50 
inches of snow in parts of northern Colorado and shut down travel from the 
Denver area to southeastern Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
The fierce storm, driven by winds up to 50 m.p.h., was blamed for at least one 
traffic death in Colorado, and some highways were closed and littered with 
stuck and stalled vehicles Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The freezing rain moved into Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota, Wisconsin and 
Minnesota, coating power lines, roads and tree limbs and knocking out 
electricity. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just like an ice-skating rink on the interstate," said Bob Gantz, a 
mechanic for Dave's Auto Repair in Ankeny, Iowa. "The patrolmen couldn't even 
stand up on the pavement to direct traffic." 
</P>
<P>
Half of the village of Hemingford in the Nebraska Panhandle lost electricity 
Wednesday as branches fell on power lines. "It sounds like we have a lot of 
lumberjacks outside," said Peggy Reynold, administrator in the village of 
1,023. 
</P>
<P>
At least 90,000 Iowa Power customers in central Iowa were without electricity 
today, and company spokesman John McCarroll said it may be the largest winter 
outage in the company's history. Schools were closed for the first time this 
winter in Des Moines. 
</P>
<P>
Police said nearly every street in Des Moines was closed or partly closed at 
some point by downed lines or fallen limbs. Thick fog covered the city early 
today, cutting visibility during morning rush-hour traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Commuters in Colorado today faced slush-covered highways, still strewn with 
abandoned vehicles. The public transit system in Denver was back on schedule 
today after cancellation of up to 30 bus routes Wednesday. But at least two 
school districts decided to keep all schools closed for another day. 
</P>
<P>
Snow continued to fall overnight in southern Wyoming, northern Colorado and 
southwest Nebraska. Freezing rain extended from north-central Nebraska across 
parts of South Dakota, the southern half of Minnesota and parts of Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Rain and a few thunderstorms reached from western Wisconsin across western 
Illinois, and parts of Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, Kansas, Arkansas, Mississippi, 
Alabama, Tennessee and Kentucky.

Israel, under U.S. pressure to convene peace talks with Palestinians, warned 
former President Jimmy Carter today not to side with the Arabs on his Middle 
East trip next week. 
</P>
<P>
Carter forged the historic 1979 Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty, and Israeli 
newspapers say he would now like to mediate the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
</P>
<P>
The former President will meet Israeli and Palestinian leaders when he visits 
four Middle Eastern countries and the Israeli-occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
But the daily Haaretz said Israeli security officials are worried that Carter 
would take the side of Palestinians waging a 27-month-old revolt in the 
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.

Iraqi Oil Minister Issam Abdul-Rahim Chalabi said today that OPEC's 
production-sharing pact would stay unchanged for at least three months. 
</P>
<P>
His remarks, before a meeting of the group's 13 oil ministers in Vienna on 
March 16, appeared to dash hopes by the United Arab Emirates for a higher 
official output quota. 
</P>
<P>
The UAE is now producing double its OPEC quota of nearly 1.1 million barrels a 
day but faces political pressure to comply with the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Last month it again called for a better market share at the meeting of the 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. 
</P>
<P>
"The quotas reached at the organization's last meeting in November will remain 
the same for the first half of this year," the Gulf News Agency quoted Chalabi 
as saying in Baghdad.

The French government suggested today that Peugeot, the nation's largest 
private industrial company, link up with Fiat of Italy to form an auto group 
big enough to withstand growing Japanese competition in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The comment from a highly placed French official was made days after 
Daimler-Benz AG of West Germany and Mitsubishi Corp. of Japan announced a 
wide-ranging cooperation agreement involving cars and other industrial sectors. 
In addition, Volvo and Renault have entered a similar agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The official, briefing journalists on condition he not be identified, said the 
government expects one or two of the six major European car manufacturers to 
disappear within the next 10 years.

The Federal Communications Commission today proposed to loosen its regulation 
of AT&amp;T, saying the one-time phone monopoly now faces "significant 
competition" in the interstate long-distance marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, in a 4-0 vote, adopted a staff proposal that, if finally 
approved, would give the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. some of the 
freedom it says it needs to maneuver against competitors such as MCI 
Communications Corp. and US Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
The FCC last year gave AT&amp;T a major deregulatory victory when it dumped its 
20-year rate-of-return regulation of AT&amp;T's profits in exchange for a 
system that controls AT&amp;T's prices within certain limits tied to the rate 
of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The commission proposed phased-in changes in certain business services, 
extending later to 800 services, international messaging and operator services.

Singer Willie Nelson has a new cause -- the victims of a tire fire in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson has five shows scheduled this month in Ontario province, and part of the 
proceeds from them will go toward the environmental relief fund set up to help 
residents of the rural community of Hagersville recover from a fire that burned 
12 million tires over a three-week period. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, who is touring with Ricky Van Shelton and George Fox, a Canadian 
country star and cattle rancher, has helped raise millions of dollars for 
farmers with the Farm Aid concerts. 
</P>
<P>
"Farming plays a big part in the economy of the area, and when Willie Nelson 
and the other artists were made aware of the situation they were very anxious 
to help," concert promoter Joe Owens said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the cable service Nashville Network announced today that it will 
telecast Farm Aid IV live from the Hoosier Dome in Indianapolis on Saturday, 
April 7. The Nashville Network will carry the first seven hours of the concert 
exclusively, from 1 p.m. until 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Discussions are proceeding to have the three prime-time hours, from 8 p.m. 
until 11 p.m., carried by one of the broadcast networks.

CBS, TURNER NEWS LINKUP IS RUMORED;

MEDIA: HIGH COST OF OPERATING FOREIGN NEWS BUREAUS MAY LEAD TO JOINT OPERATIONS 
FOR CNN AND CBS.

CBS Inc. is close to an agreement on a news linkup with its former foe Ted 
Turner, the cable television magnate whose unwanted 1985 takeover bid forced 
the network into a painful restructuring, industry sources say. 
</P>
<P>
The sources say CBS will likely announce this month that it will cooperate with 
Turner's Cable News Network in foreign news coverage. 
</P>
<P>
The cooperation pact would help struggling CBS, which has had a series of 
failures in its overseas news coverage. It would also save the network money in 
what is a notoriously expensive area for broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
Moving a correspondent to cover a story overseas can easily cost several 
thousand dollars a day, since it also means that a camera crew, producer and 
tape editor will be sent, along with hundreds of pounds of equipment. 
</P>
<P>
CBS News spokesman Tom Goodman had no comment on a possible CNN deal and said 
no announcements were pending. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Hayworth, director of public relations for CNN, confirmed published 
reports that talks have taken place with CBS. 
</P>
<P>
"Discussions have taken place on a number of matters, including news matters, 
but I've got no comment on the proximity of an agreement or whether there is an 
agreement pending," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Exact details of the proposed linkup or any financial terms were not available. 
</P>

Sources within CBS note that the network, consistently ranked No. 3 in both its 
morning and evening newscasts, has suffered setbacks recently in coverage in 
Panama, the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and South Africa.

With television news coverage an increasing cash drain in a bottom-line 
sensitive industry, CBS has been cutting back its foreign operations.

<P>
In the last decade, CBS, whose reputation for quality once gave it the nickname 
the "Tiffany network," has closed bureaus in Bonn, Paris, Hong Kong, Bangkok, 
Beirut, Cairo and Athens.

ABC News, now No. 1 in the evening news ratings, has close links with the news 
film service WTN, which supplies footage to broadcasters around the world, 
serving as a "wire service" for networks. 
</P>
<P>
NBC has gone even further, taking a 38% stake in Visnews, another news film 
agency. NBC and Visnews now share some offices overseas.

The production manager of the pop band New Edition was found guilty of 
voluntary manslaughter Wednesday in last summer's fatal shooting of another 
band's bodyguard outside the Pittsburgh Civic Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Byrd, 31, of Los Angeles faces a maximum sentence of five to 10 years in 
prison for the shooting death of Anthony Bee, 33, of New York, who died July 9. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting climaxed two days of brawls between crew members of the two bands. 
</P>
<P>
An Allegheny County Common Pleas Court jury deliberated more than 12 hours over 
two days before returning the guilty verdict, rejecting Byrd's claim that he 
was justified in shooting Bee after the victim attacked him with a baseball 
bat. 
</P>
<P>
Common Pleas Judge Jeffrey Manning revoked Byrd's $100,000 bond and ordered 
that he be held in the County Jail to await sentencing April 18.

Singer Freddy Fender says he doubts the death of one of his band members is 
drug-related but says the tragedy stirred memories of his own struggle with 
drugs and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Fender, 52, said Wednesday that he suffered a deep loss in the death of bass 
guitarist Johnny Garcia, who collapsed and died Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of death is under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a recovering alcoholic and drug addict, and it's my commitment to other 
drug addicts and other drunks to help them, because it's going to help me. . . 
. If there is any person that is anti-drugs and anti-booze, it's me," Fender 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Fender, best known for his country western hit "Wasted Days and Wasted Nights," 
saw his career plummet when he drank heavily and used drugs. Since entering a 
treatment center in 1985, he has tried to rebuild his career. 
</P>
<P>
He knows exactly how long he's been sober: "Four years, six months and nine 
days."

Nadia Comaneci's agent says she may have broken up with Constantin Panait, the 
married man who engineered her escape from Romania. 
</P>
<P>
The Olympic gymnast canceled her first U.S. appearance on the lecture circuit, 
apparently because she was upset over the breakup, said her agent, Bob Davis. 
</P>
<P>
She was to have given a speech Wednesday night at Nassau Community College. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he has not spoken to Comaneci since she left for Tokyo more than a 
week ago with Panait, a roofer with a wife and four children in Florida. But 
people in Comaneci's entourage say the two broke up en route back from Japan, 
Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Comaneci is staying with friends in Montreal, Davis said, where she won the 
first perfect 10s in Olympic gymnastics history in 1976. Panait is on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Comaneci said in a recent magazine interview that she and Panait had no plans 
to marry. She said last month that she intends to marry a 30-year-old fellow 
Romanian who is expected to enter the United States later this year.

LIZ SMITH: MADONNA GETS IT 'ALTOGETHER' FOR VANITY FAIR

"I SLEEP a certain number of hours every night, then I like to get up and get 
on with it. I set aside the hours I have to exercise. Then I set aside the 
hours for creativity. Yes, I can summon my creativity!" says Madonna to Kevin 
Sessums in the sizzling new Vanity Fair. 
</P>
<P>
This April issue hits it big with Madonna on the cover and on nine pages 
inside, photographed seductively by Helmut Newton (who else?). Of course, there 
is an obligatory Newton-type picture of Madonna baring one breast. This is the 
first look at a part of Madonna's "altogether" since those early nude shots 
(made when she was little more than a young girl) surfaced in the skin 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
But there is a lot more to Madonna's interview than tantalizing glimpses of her 
famous flesh. The star talks candidly about her fame: "Listen -- how can you 
say I'm a private person if I'm in show business? Just because I conduct myself 
in a particular way, you couldn't straight-facedly call me a private person." 
On Warren Beatty, her "Dick Tracy" co-star: "He's been an icon for years . . . 
obviously, somebody who hasn't experienced it would be more threatened by my 
fame than he is. . . . We're just perfect together." Madonna breaks into tears 
while discussing her ex-husband, Sean Penn. She says the divorce was "like a 
death to deal with. It's very, very difficult." And, of course, Madonna 
addresses the Sandra Bernhard did-they-or-didn't-they question. They didn't, 
says Madonna. It was all in fun, a hoot, but, "It got out of hand and then I 
didn't want to do it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
But typically, Madonna's most potent remarks concern AIDS and the Catholic 
church. "I want to do anything I can to promote AIDS education. . . . Aside 
from Hitler, AIDS is the worst thing to happen in the 20th Century. The sad 
thing is that it makes people even more bigoted. It gives people a reason to 
vent their true feelings about homosexuality." And how does the Catholic 
superstar view the Catholic church's stand on homosexuality? "I think it's 
disgusting. I think it's hypocritical. And unloving. It's not what God and 
Christianity are all about." 
</P>
<P>
MADONNA ASIDE, the most fascinating article to me in this particular issue is 
Gerri Hirshey's interview with Judith Campbell Exner. It is the heart-wrenching 
story of how Judith has been reunited with the son she gave away at birth (an 
effort to protect the child from all the FBI surveillance, torment and media 
furor that came about after she was revealed to be a John F. Kennedy mistress 
and a messenger between the President and mobster Sam Giancana). 
</P>
<P>
This is the first story ever to do justice to the miseries of Exner, who has 
been painted as a kind of scarlet woman because she dared to sleep with a 
married man. To make matters worse, many were scandalized that Judith resembled 
Jacqueline Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
About the son -- his father is a well-known movie executive. He has been 
advised of the boy's existence but wants nothing to do with him. Exner's child, 
when he became an adult, sought her out and recently found her. She is mortally 
ill with cancer, but he visits her frequently and is devoted. The Judith Exner 
story is not a pretty one but, at least, it has the glimmer of a happy ending.

Luciano Pavarotti says a diet to reduce his substantial girth has melted away 
80 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
When pressed at a news conference Wednesday, however, he refused to say how 
much he weighs. 
</P>
<P>
"I have lost 80 pounds and so I am 80 pounds less than I was," Pavarotti said 
with a broad smile. Asked how he did it, Pavarotti replied: "Very simple. I 
don't take alcohol, sugar or fat. Just 1,800 calories a day. It's brilliant." 
</P>
<P>
To laughter, he said: "Tonight, I will have a beautiful piece of salmon with 
vegetables, a piece of bread, strawberries, mineral water and lemon and coffee. 
What do you want more?" 
</P>
<P>
The 54-year-old Italian tenor was in London for his first appearance in nearly 
six years at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.

New Jersey Nets forward Charles Shackleford was placed in a pre-trial 
intervention program today at a court hearing into marijuana possession charges 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
Shackleford's attorney, Matthew Boylan, acknowledged that his client was 
carrying marijuana when he was arrested March 1, but Shackleford did not enter 
a plea under terms of state law that allows first-time offenders to enter a 
pre-trial program. 
</P>
<P>
The pre-trial program is designed to allow authorities to monitor Shackleford's 
activities and does not involve substance abuse treatment or counseling, Boylan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
If the player successfully completes terms of the six-month program, a 
disorderly person charge will be dropped and Shackleford's record cleared. 
</P>
<P>
Shackleford, 23, is the focus of news reports about an investigation of an 
alleged point-shaving scheme when he was at North Carolina State.

A moose knocked four-time winner Rick Swenson out of the lead of the Iditarod 
Trail Sled Dog Race today, stomping through his team and slowing him enough to 
allow defending champion Joe Runyan to move in front. 
</P>
<P>
Swenson had left McGrath hours before anyone else, but he turned back after the 
run-in with the moose and waited for other racers to try their luck with the 
animal. 
</P>
<P>
A veterinarian checked out one of Swenson's injured dogs, which was pronounced 
fit. 
</P>
<P>
Nine other racers set out before dawn -- none reporting any more moose -- but 
Swenson waited for daylight before returning to the trail, and that dropped him 
to 10th place. 
</P>
<P>
Swenson said he saw the moose ahead of him at the first river portage about a 
mile out of McGrath and was trying to cross the river ahead of it. 
</P>
<P>
"She was on the river," Swenson said. "It was just one of those normal races to 
see who would get there first." 
</P>
<P>
Swenson said he had hoped the moose would keep going, but it turned into his 
team, trampling some of the dogs and turning them back on the sled. 
</P>
<P>
While Swenson waited, the nine who set out included Runyan, Lavon Barve and 
three-time winner Susan Butcher. Runyan was first into the next checkpoint 23 
miles away at Takotna and headed on to Ophir, a ghost town left from 
turn-of-the-century gold mining days. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in McGrath rerouted the race through town because of deep snow along 
the usual Kuskokwim River route. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Butcher came upon seventh-placed Tim Osmar as he fired shots into 
the air to scare off a buffalo that would not leave the trail. 
</P>
<P>
"Susan Butcher showed up in her red (snow) suit and that's what did it," Osmar 
said. "She scared the buffalo right on." 
</P>
<P>
Mushers are encountering some of the 800 animals that freely roam Alaska in 
five herds. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 18 of the 68 teams still in the endurance run from Anchorage to Nome 
had pulled into McGrath by 6:30 a.m. today.

President Gerhard Heiberg of the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee said 
the 1994 Winter Games may have to be dropped unless the Norwegian Parliament 
makes firm decisions about investments and arenas by early April, a newspaper 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Lillehammer was awarded the Games by the International Olympic Committee more 
than two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Parliament has not yet provided the financial guarantees the organizing 
committee needs to start construction work and other preparations. 
</P>
<P>
The Lillehammer Tilskuer quoted Heiberg as telling local businessmen and 
investors, "By April 5 the location of arenas, the cost and investment 
guidelines and the whole organization model must be decided by Parliament. If 
not, or if major Olympic decisions are delayed until next fall, the entire 
arrangement is at risk and we should consider dropping the Games."

ENTERTAINMENT: ITALIAN FINANCIER GIANCARLO PARRETTI HAS AMASSED AN EMPIRE OF TV 
AND MOVIE STUDIOS. BUT SKEPTICS SAY HIS COMPANY LACKS THE FINANCES TO BUY 
MGM/UA.

Hollywood doesn't always embrace aspiring film moguls, and many were skeptical 
when Giancarlo Parretti came to town in 1987 with a bankroll and an ambition to 
build the next important film company. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the Italian financier won control of Cannon Group, a struggling 
mini-studio, and on Wednesday his Pathe Communications announced plans to buy 
MGM/UA Communications for $1 billion. With these and other purchases, Parretti 
has assembled a diversified international entertainment empire of film 
libraries, TV and movie studios, and theaters. 
</P>
<P>
But he hasn't convinced the skeptics. 
</P>
<P>
Parretti, 48, a one-time waiter with a cheerful manner and a murky past, still 
must persuade Hollywood and Wall Street that he can complete the deal and 
rebuild a frail MGM to the kind of health that will make the studio worthy of 
its great name. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he'd announce a deal, and now he has," said one Hollywood film 
executive, who asked to remain unidentified. "But will it close?" 
</P>
<P>
Pathe's ability to finance such a deal "is not apparent from its balance 
sheet," says analyst Jeffrey Logsdon, of the Crowell, Weedon &amp; Co. 
investment firm. "You've got to wonder." 
</P>
<P>
And others on Wall Street apparently shared Logsdon's view, for MGM's stock 
closed Wednesday at $17.75 a share, significantly below the company's offering 
price of $20. 
</P>
<P>
Parretti, who was said to be flying to Europe on Wednesday and unavailable for 
comment, has in recent years faced questions not only about his business 
prospects but also about the sources of his funds and his past business 
practices. He has been accused in publications here and abroad of money 
laundering and Mafia ties and has successfully brought a series of libel suits 
in Europe to defend himself. 
</P>
<P>
The son of an olive merchant from the Umbrian hill town of Orvieto, Italy, 
Parretti is a short, chunky man who began trying to speak English only two 
years ago. But if he hasn't yet mastered the language, he appears to have 
quickly learned the life style of Hollywood magnates. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he bought an $8.9-million Beverly Hills mansion, which he decorated 
with paintings by Goya, Picasso and Miro. He has a taste for Rolls-Royce sedans 
and fine cigars, and he owns a mahogany desk once used by MGM boss L. B. Mayer. 
</P>
<P>
Questions about the extent of his financial resources have been raised as he 
has bid several times without success for Hollywood properties. 
</P>
<P>
After paying $200 million for control of Cannon, Parretti last year bid 
unsuccessfully for three struggling independent studios: New World 
Entertainment, De Laurentiis Entertainment Group and Kings Road Entertainment. 
Also last year, Parretti was among a long line of companies that bid 
unsuccessfully for MGM/UA. 
</P>
<P>
But though the first MGM bid failed, Parretti made an important alliance when 
he hired Alan Ladd Jr., MGM's former production boss, to head his newly formed 
U.S. production company, which he had named Pathe Communications. While 
Parretti's abilities as a studio head are open to question, Ladd knows MGM, has 
Hollywood's respect and presumably the kind of relationships that Pathe will 
need to turn MGM around. 
</P>
<P>
Pathe itself controls a film library of more than 1,200 titles, a theater 
network with more than 1,000 screens in five countries, film studios in Italy 
and a film laboratory in France. Much of these assets came from Parretti's 1989 
acquisition of Pathe Cinema, France's oldest film company, for $160 million. 
</P>
<P>
For the nine months that ended last Sept. 30, Pathe reported a loss of $54.6 
million on revenue of $276 million. 
</P>
<P>
As Parretti became more visible in Hollywood, he has repeatedly been forced to 
deny allegations about his past. 
</P>
<P>
Last March, Parretti issued a statement to denounce a story in Business Week 
magazine that said he had indirect ties to at least one Mafia family and that 
accused him and Pathe Chairman Florio Fiorini of money laundering through a 
network of private foreign holding companies. Fiorini, a partner on a number of 
deals, has become well known in Italy for quickly buying and selling companies 
in the manner of some American corporate raiders. 
</P>
<P>
The Business Week story, which Parretti denounced as "riddled with false 
statements," said the pair had been implicated in a series of financial 
scandals in France and Italy, and it quoted business associates and government 
officials as saying that they had built their fortune "from business deals 
arranged by high-ranking government officials." 
</P>
<P>
The story said that early in his career, Parretti had been forced to take a job 
as a waiter on a transatlantic liner after he was accused of falsifying balance 
sheets at an Italian hotel he managed. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews, Parretti has ridiculed accusations that his wealth was derived 
from the Mafia, saying such charges reflected only jealousy. 
</P>
<P>
In last November's quarterly report to shareholders, Pathe said the company has 
won four libel judgments in French courts, against such publications as 
L'Express and Nouvel Observateur. In an unusual aside, the report to 
shareholders said Parretti's "sole purpose in initiating these legal actions 
was vindication against defamation, disparagement, indirect harassment and 
innuendo. Having won these judgments, it is hoped that future reporting will 
aim toward a higher level of accuracy."
