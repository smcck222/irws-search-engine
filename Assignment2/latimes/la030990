11 STILL AT LARGE AFTER CHULA VISTA JAILBREAK; 
</P>
<P>
ESCAPE: OVERCROWDING, OUTMODED SECURITY SYSTEM CITED AS KEY REASONS FOR THE

Thirteen inmates, two of whom are accused of murder, escaped from a San Diego 
County jail here Wednesday night by sawing through steel bars with hacksaws 
smuggled in through an open window, authorities said. Eleven of the men 
remained at large late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The jailbreak was the biggest in county history and jail officials Thursday 
blamed overcrowded conditions and the failure of the county government to 
respond to requests for improvements in the security system. 
</P>
<P>
The men escaped about 8:45 p.m. Wednesday by sawing through two bars, each 
about 5 inches deep and 1 1/2 inches thick, and then using the bars to smash 
through a plate-glass window. Sheriff's Capt. Chuck Wood said a motion sensor 
system on the windows, installed when the jail was built in 1982, no longer 
works. 
</P>
<P>
Wood said he was "mad as hell" about the escape and called it the most 
embarrassing moment in his law-enforcement career. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Department officials said that Christopher Bell, 21, is considered 
the most dangerous of the 11 men still at large. Bell is charged with robbery 
and assault and is considered the key suspect in the October slaying of a La 
Mesa man who was kidnaped at a bank automatic teller machine and slain 
execution-style. Bell was being held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
Jail officials were not aware an escape had occurred until a passer-by called 
911 after seeing inmates getting in a car outside the jail. Two of the inmates 
involved in the breakout were quickly recaptured after the passer-by notified 
the Chula Vista Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Wood said the escape was successful despite perimeter guards and remote 
security cameras. He said the jail's overall security system is ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
"I've begged the county to get (the windows) fixed, and they just haven't," he 
said. "I don't think we have a bad facility here, but I do think it'll take 
about $100,000 to fix it up, primarily by installing sensors on the windows and 
outside as well." 
</P>
<P>
After breaking out, the men lowered themselves 40 feet to the ground by using 
bed sheets, Wood said. He said an investigation has determined that somebody 
lowered the hacksaws by rope to the inmates from a public walkway 15 feet above 
one of the jail's unattended windows. The jail is built below ground and the 
public entry is at ground level, above the cellblocks. Wood said the delivery 
of the hacksaws took place without being detected by the guard on duty in 
Module 4B when the breakout occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Wood would not blame any of the 12 guards who worked in the building Wednesday 
night. He complained Thursday of massive overcrowding, which Sheriff John 
Duffy, who runs the county's jails, has cited numerous times in response to a 
spate of escapes and riots at both the Chula Vista facility and the one in El 
Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
The South Bay jail is seven miles from the Mexican border and houses, in the 
words of Wood, "some of the toughest inmates in the county. On Jan. 3, we had 
105 (suspected) murderers in here." 
</P>
<P>
Wood said the most serious offenders in San Diego County are kept at the County 
Jail downtown, but all of those who escaped Wednesday were felony suspects. 
Wood said he didn't believe the inmates were a danger to the neighborhood 
because he expected they were headed out of the area. 
</P>
<P>
Wood said the breakout was the second since he came to Chula Vista a year ago. 
The first occurred in December, when seven escapes smashed through a window in 
Module 3A and lowered themselves to the ground in a similar fashion. Two of 
those prisoners are still at large, Wood said. He said that only one other 
escape occurred between the opening of the jail in 1982 and last year. 
</P>
<P>
Wood said the Chula Vista jail is built to house 192 inmates but currently 
contains more than 750. The men sleep three to a bunk in 8-by-11-foot cells 
scrawled with primitive graffiti. Wood said he has a staff of 53 deputies but 
no more than a dozen are on duty at night. 
</P>
<P>
Wood said he blamed overcrowding and a lack of funding by the county's General 
Services Administration for not coming up with the money to make the jail more 
secure. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no one individual to blame for this," he said. "The building's 
construction was aesthetically pleasing, when, in fact, it should have been 
utilitarian. There are some holes that need to be filled, but this building is 
nothing like El Cajon's. That's a cracker box. Ours is a fairly secure 
facility. But we have an obvious problem when somebody can drop two hacksaws 
over a public walkway and into an open window and coordinate a fairly 
well-planned escape." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Capt. Ben McLaughlin, who runs the El Cajon jail, calls that facility 
one of the worst in the country and maybe the most poorly constructed. Ten 
inmates have escaped from El Cajon since the jail began housing them in 1983. 
The most recent problem at the El Cajon facility was a racial brawl that left 
12 inmates injured, three with serious stab wounds. 
</P>
<P>
Wood said he had asked not only for a system designed to detect escapes from 
the Chula Vista facility but also grating on the window through which the 
hacksaws were passed. He said he took $5,000 out of his own budget Thursday 
morning and installed vertical bars, which were welded over the window in each 
cell. 
</P>
<P>
In regard to Wood's complaints, Bob Lerner, public affairs manager for the 
county, said Thursday that the unattended window, through which the hacksaws 
were exchanged, "has never been identified by anybody as a security problem. 
That window was identified as a health hazard and General Services did have it 
on its list to put a grate on the window to restrict the pigeon droppings, 
which are quite extensive." 
</P>
<P>
Lerner said General Services was considering the request about upgraded 
security at the jail but did not have a timetable as to when it might happen. 
</P>
<P>
Wood was supported at Thursday's press conference by County Supervisor Brian 
Bilbray, whose district includes Chula Vista. Bilbray said General Services had 
been "dragging its feet" on needed improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened last night was just the symptom of a problem," Bilbray said. 
"Proposition A has been held up by a judge, who says it's inappropriate. And 
it's OK to send a half-cent sales tax to San Francisco just because they had an 
earthquake. We're much shorter in our funding than San Francisco, and we need 
the money bad. We need it for jails." 
</P>
<P>
(Proposition A, which voters approved in 1988, called for a half-cent increase 
in the county sales tax to finance the construction of new courts and jails. A 
Superior Court judge in Riverside County ruled that the proposition, which was 
approved by a simple majority, violated Proposition 13's mandate for a 
two-thirds approval of new taxes. His ruling is being appealed.) 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Christopher Bell, Wood identified the inmates who remained at 
large as follows: 
</P>
<P>
Sergio Martinez, 22, and Audias Gomez, 36, who face murder charges; Larry 
Dominguez, 18, who faces attempted murder charges; Charles Neuman, 28, an 
alleged thief; Jesus Lopez, 21, who is accused of assault; Lance Williams, 25, 
who faces assault charges; Benjamin Tapia, 21, an accused burglar; Michael 
Walker, 29, accused of possessing stolen property; Carlos Renteria, 27, jailed 
for investigation of burglary; and Francisco Yacumba, 19, who faces a drug 
allegation.

I have just recently returned from a camping trip in Anzo Borrego State Park 
and I am happy to say that for the first time in many years I have not had to 
pick up the trash of other careless campers. Usually when I go I bring a trash 
bag for my own refuse and another one for the garbage that other people have 
left behind. 
</P>
<P>
I take it as a good sign that people are finally becoming aware of how delicate 
nature is and that we should live with nature, in harmony, and not against it.

SEASON OPENS ON TIME (WE WISH) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the season of our soul's renewal. This is the time when expectation, 
like the sun, rises a little higher as each new day marks the hurtling of 
winter into spring with delicious inevitability toward Opening Day. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball: No other game whispers so sweetly of the spirit's secret yearnings. 
Its rhythms are those of the seasons: Hope in springtime, industry through the 
summer, bountiful harvest or brittle failure in the fall. Thus it was in that 
gentle, rural America imagined in our common memory, a half-invented Eden, a 
garden of innocent promise. Baseball is an annual reminder that -- to turn 
Robert Frost's line on its head -- we Americans were the land before the land 
was ours. 
</P>
<P>
Then, of course, there is the game itself. We do not call contests between 
baseball teams "matches," but games. (And when we refer to baseball, we do not 
call it a "sport," but the national pastime.) In it, we approach the infinite 
on our own terms: Theoretically every baseball game could go on indefinitely. 
The field itself is a green and open place, a memorial to that time when such 
things were not a luxury. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball is as we would like to be, and imagine we once were. For that reason, 
we are uniquely forgiving of those who betray it. No one would speak of Joe 
Jackson and Benedict Arnold in the same breath. And nobody laughed at Pete 
Rose's trouble. When we think of Shoeless Joe and Charlie Hustle, we are sadly 
puzzled and hopeful of their redemption somewhere in time. 
</P>
<P>
We might even have forgiven the owners and the players' association -- if they 
had not let their quarrel over money stand between the rest of us and the 
promise of Opening Day. But some things are unforgivable -- and there's not 
much time left for redemption.

THE ARMS RACE IN NICARAGUA; 
</P>
<P>
IT TAKES TWO TO DISARM -- CONTRAS AS WELL AS SANDINISTAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nicaragua is not Lebanon -- at least not yet. 
</P>
<P>
So recent reports that the Sandinistas are passing out guns to their supporters 
before handing the government over to President-elect Violeta Chamorro are not 
the cause for panic that they would be in Beirut. But it's an alarming 
development that must be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
The tactic is not new: The need for a well-armed militia has been Sandinista 
dogma ever since they took control of the popular revolution that overthrew 
Somoza in 1979. The country's 75,000-person army, for example, includes 30,000 
militia members and reservists who keep their weapons at home. So the 
Sandinistas won't stop their routine practice of distributing thousands of 
pistols and rifles while the Contra rebels who have been fighting against them 
also remain armed. 
</P>
<P>
After their defeat in last month's election, Sandinista leaders said they were 
willing to give up power. But they won't leave their many supporters in the 
Nicaraguan countryside to the mercy of the Contras or the vengeful landowners 
who may try to retake farms that were confiscated during the last 10 years and 
broken into small plots for pro-Sandinista peasants. 
</P>
<P>
That's why Chamorro and other opposition leaders must renew their effort to 
persuade Contra leaders in neighboring Honduras to demobilize their troops. 
Turning in their guns would be the clearest signal the Contras can send the 
Sandinistas. That would also deprive the Sandinistas of any excuse for handing 
out any more guns on their side -- or, if they did, subject them to 
condemnation by the United Nations, Organization of American States and the 
many other neutral bodies that verified Chamorro's election victory. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously when lots of people have guns, the potential for a blood bath exists. 
But it doesn't have to come to that -- if both sides are convinced that there's 
no longer any need for violence in Nicaragua. For now, the first step must be 
taken by Chamorro and the opposition. They have won, after all, and if the 
Sandinistas try to deny them that victory, they will have something a lot more 
potent than guns to back them up: world support.

<P>
The editorial was a wonderful example of liberal arrogance. In espousing such 
leftist ideals as greater bureaucratic regulation and divestment of resources 
from law enforcement, the editorial contradicts the spirit of positions that 
Times' editorials have previously maintained. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, a law making parents criminally responsible for their children's 
gang involvement was bitterly opposed in these pages. Yet your editorial seeks 
to hold Block personally responsible for the self-serving actions of a few of 
the vast number over whom he holds jurisdiction. Need I remind you that it was 
the Sheriff's Department itself which launched these fruitful investigations, 
without the prompting of outside "experts" such as your editorial writers. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when your writers are lauding a Marxist dictator for being benevolent 
in defeat, despite his success in avoiding real elections for over 10 years, 
you should show at least an iota of respect for the sheriff's actions.

DRUG CHARGES IN SHERIFF'S DEPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While I do not condone the alleged activities of the 10 accused officers 
involved in the drug-money theft case, I feel our modern way of life in America 
can only lead to more of the same. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of Block bemoaning the skimming of monies collected in raids on drug 
premises, why not suggest an alternative program? 
</P>
<P>
There is a great deal of money involved in most seizures, as well as the tons 
of product confiscated. Why should our legal system compound the problem of 
maintaining honest control of cash collected in each successful raid? 
</P>
<P>
It seems only fair that when cash is seized, a portion of this money should go 
into a fund to be distributed to all officers engaged in ending the drug 
scourge. In my opinion, a 60% distribution to the officers and/or their 
respective pension funds would eliminate the necessity of seeing many loyal and 
good agents fall by the wayside and corrupt themselves. 
</P>
<P>
A distribution program would remove the reason for 90% of officers who succumb 
to the greed aspect within most of us. It's worth a try, and the men deserve 
the extra compensation.

Once the verdicts are in the only ones who may need reassurance are Block and

Despite calls by Nelson Mandela for black students to return to school to 
prepare themselves for a new society, on any given day one-fourth of South 
Africa's black high school students are still not in class. This does not mean 
that Mandela has failed. It does emphasize the seriousness and stubbornness of 
the education crisis in the black community. 
</P>
<P>
Central to the crisis is the rejection of the inferior education prescribed for 
blacks since the National Party came into power in 1948. The present 
government, trapped in its apartheid policies, argues that while improvements 
are necessary, separate education for different race groups will not be 
abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-apartheid organizations reject this separatism and have made it part of 
their confrontation with the government. In practical terms, this means that 
for the past five years there has been little schooling of any kind in black 
areas. This has eaten into the social fabric of the community. Drug and liquor 
abuse have grown. Robberies and rapes are increasing. Girls, some as young as 
13, are mothers. 
</P>
<P>
The crisis is one of the biggest facing the recently legalized African National 
Congress, particularly as education is what most blacks want for their 
children. Any political organization that can resolve the crisis will have 
grateful black parents voting for it lock, stock and barrel. 
</P>
<P>
For Mandela and the ANC to consolidate their position as the de facto 
government of a new South Africa, they will have to ensure, through their 
allied community organizations, that students return to class. But events are 
not moving in this direction. 
</P>
<P>
In early March, more than 6,000 teachers in Soweto and Alexandra townships went 
on strike, calling for a complete overhaul of the educational system. Many 
parents angrily asked if a walkout would make children go back to class. They 
noted that schools have been disrupted by protest over and over again, and that 
Soweto has hardly had a week of effective learning this year. 
</P>
<P>
Black teachers, at the front of the crisis, argue that the situation is beyond 
their control. They have no option but to join their young charges in 
anti-government demonstrations, demanding change. 
</P>
<P>
Parents, unimpressed by this explanation, are now insistent in their demands 
that political activism be reduced to prevent education from being sacrificed. 
For instance, of 196,000 black students who took graduation exams last year, 
only 18,000 qualified for college. The results predictably provoked a round of 
recriminations between the government and community organizations. The ANC, the 
major organization in black politics, had to carry much of the blame. Despite 
denials by the ANC, when students five years ago adopted the slogan "liberation 
now, education later," the ANC did not intervene. Instead it praised the 
courage of the youth for challenging the government's inferior educational 
system. Students chanted ANC slogans during their protest campaigns. Now, while 
black schooling is caught in this whirlpool of destruction, white children 
continue to learn. Close to 30,000 qualified for university from last year's 
70,000 entrants. Black youths will have sacrificed their lives in vain, as 
whites will still be in control of the country's future, this time because of 
skills rather than color. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody now realizes that when the government introduced separate and 
inferior education for blacks, it was to keep them in perpetual servitude. But 
when these same blacks directly and indirectly keep themselves out of class, 
whose interests are they serving? 
</P>
<P>
Conscious of this, and the clamor by parents, the ANC and other organizations 
have embarked on a campaign to get pupils back in class. The ANC and Mandela 
must show parents that they are concerned with the education of their children, 
for education is the only hope that blacks have to genuinely control the 
destiny of this nation.

TIMBERWOLVES QUICKLY ERASE ALL DOUBT; 
</P>
<P>
CLIPPERS: CAMPBELL, RICHARDSON LEAD ATTACK IN FIRST QUARTER OF MINNESOTA'S 
111-94 VICTORY.

Pooh Richardson isn't actually wearing his heart on his sleeve, but it's close. 
He wears a white 44, the number Hank Gathers had at Loyola Marymount, in a 
black circular patch on the left chest of his Minnesota Timberwolves' jersey. 
</P>
<P>
"He's always going to be with me every time I step on the court," Richardson, 
the rookie point guard from UCLA, said of his former high school rival from 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson wore the patch for the first time Wednesday and also Thursday night, 
when he had a career-high 27 points and 14 assists to help the Timberwolves 
beat the Clippers, 111-94, before 21,632 at the Metrodome. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson let his friend go, emotionally speaking, Tuesday. He spoke with 
Gathers' mother in Los Angeles and settled some feelings. 
</P>
<P>
Not long after, he played basketball. "He was a very dear friend of mine," 
Richardson said. "He passed, and I have to look on to the future. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be very difficult. No question about it. I'm not handling it too well 
now. But I just have to try to hang in there. I've just got to keep going. It 
still hurts, but I can't worry." 
</P>
<P>
"When people talk about it, I still see the hurt in Pooh," said teammate Tony 
Campbell, who made 16 of 23 free throws en route to a game-high 30 points. 
"When people remind him about it, his demeanor changes. On the court, though, 
he's really picked up. He is playing great." 
</P>
<P>
The Timberwolves are 11-14 when Richardson has started, 5-29 when he hasn't. 
The 10th player selected in the draft is also committing only 1.9 turnovers the 
last 19 games he has started at guard for Minnesota. He is averaging 19 points 
the last four outings. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson had 11 points and eight assists by halftime. For the second night in 
a row, almost everyone on one of the worst teams in the league pushed the 
Clippers around early. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, they trailed New Jersey by 15 late in the second quarter. The 
Timberwolves, whose 16 victories is second-worst in the Western Conference, 
made that seem mild. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota, sending the Clippers home from the five-game trip early, were ahead 
20 points in the first quarter at 33-13. The Clippers trailed by 19 at the end 
of the quarter, 38-19, as the Timberwolves made 18 of 23 shots. 
</P>
<P>
"The execution and defensive effort was our worst of the year," Clipper Coach 
Don Casey said of the early going. 
</P>
<P>
Not that he had much to be pleased with in the second quarter. Minnesota's lead 
reached a game-high 23 when Donald Royal hit a 16-foot jump shot from the right 
side to make it 45-22 with 9:19 remaining in the first half. Against Minnesota, 
the same team that began play last in the NBA in scoring, four points worse 
than anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight, they played well offensively," Clipper Tom Garrick said. "I don't 
know how well they usually are night in and night out, but they did the job 
tonight. We don't have to worry about other nights, though. We had to worry 
about this night." 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Reserve guard Steve Harris is expected to sign a second 10-day contract with 
the Clippers today. He has played 14 minutes in four games. . . . Charles Smith 
had 25 points and Ken Norman added 20 points and 13 rebounds for the Clippers.

TV-RADIO: CHANNEL 2 DELAYING THE NCAA PAIRINGS? WHY, IT'S MADNESS! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They call it March Madness. 
</P>
<P>
If you have cable, you can watch college basketball almost around the clock 
this weekend, beginning at 9 a.m. today with Atlantic Coast Conference 
tournament games on ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN will televise seven games live on Saturday, a single-day record. 
</P>
<P>
Even without cable, there is still plenty of basketball. There will be four 
games on the major network stations Saturday and four more Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
A highlight of it all comes when the NCAA tournament pairings are announced 
Sunday on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the nation will get the news of the tournament field live at 3:30 
p.m., PST. 
</P>
<P>
But Channel 2 will delay the pairings announcement at least 15 to 30 minutes, 
an annoyance to basketball junkies who want to know who's in and who's not 
right away. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Strong, Channel 2's director of programming, is faced with an impossible 
juggling act. 
</P>
<P>
CBS' coverage of the Big East tournament final begins at 11:30 a.m. and figures 
to end sometime after 1:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
But starting at 1 p.m. is the Pacific 10 tournament final, which is part of the 
Raycom Productions package that Channel 2 has bought. 
</P>
<P>
"We could join the Pac-10 game in progress after the Big East game," Strong 
said, "but I don't want to do that. If somehow UCLA is in it and we joined it 
30 or 40 minutes late, that would not be good. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather delay the game and show it in its entirety, and then delay the 
pairings announcement show." 
</P>
<P>
Strong said his station is also planning a special Keith Olbermann postgame 
show after the Pac-10 final. So, at best, the station won't be clear until 3:45 
-- and more likely 4 p.m. -- for the pairings show. 
</P>
<P>
Things could be worse. In recent years, the tournament pairings announcement 
has come at 2:30, but the NCAA moved it back an hour. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN is planning a rundown of the NCAA pairings during halftime of the Big West 
tournament final, which it is televising. Halftime should be about 3:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Add Channel 2: Olbermann claims his contract with the station does not expire 
this summer, as reported in this space last week. He said it has 3 1/2 years 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Olbermann also said Channel 7's Todd Donoho was not the sportscaster he had in 
mind when he said, "The producers of the Keith Olbermann Show say if you want 
to listen to a whiny, nasal sportscaster, change the dial now." 
</P>
<P>
He did not specify the target for his barb. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes it's hard to figure out what Olbermann is trying to do. 
</P>
<P>
Over the long haul, Channel 13 last weekend had its best Los Angeles Marathon 
coverage in the five years it has covered the event, and producer Phil Olsman 
and his crew are to be congratulated. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, there were few major flaws, which is saying a lot when you 
consider how difficult it is to cover an event spread over 26-plus miles. 
</P>
<P>
And Phil Stone, a late addition, did a commendable job as host of the telecast. 
</P>
<P>
But the announcing overall was simply too gushy. The announcers sounded much 
like Chris Schenkel doing college football. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe you can't blame them. Nancy Ditz, a commentator last year, pointed out 
that the prize money was not on par with some other major marathons, so L.A. 
Marathon organizer Bill Burke had her taken off this year's telecast. 
</P>
<P>
The message seemed to be this: Say anything negative and you won't be saying 
anything at all in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Feldman, Channel 13 station manager, denied this. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a meeting last Friday," he said, "and I told the announcers, 'This is 
my station and my airtime. Feel free to say anything you want, as long as it is 
truthful.' " 
</P>
<P>
It sounded as if the announcers didn't want to take that chance. 
</P>
<P>
Add marathon: Producer Olsman said the news of the death of a runner, William 
McKinney, 59, of Altadena, wasn't reported during Channel 13's coverage because 
of time constraints. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew something had happened right when we were about to go off the air," 
Olsman said. "We knew an ambulance was on the course, and we sent a crew over 
there, but we weren't able to get any concrete information before we went off 
the air. Had we known more, we might have stayed on the air." 
</P>
<P>
Last add marathon: Channel 13 has four years left on its contract with Burke, 
but only next year's race is locked up. After that, according to Feldman, the 
contract allows Burke to make a deal with a major network if he can. 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
Channel 2 will televise only one Pacific 10 tournament semifinal Saturday, at 3 
p.m., and UCLA is not in that bracket. Channel 2 can't do the 1 p.m. semifinal 
because of CBS' coverage of a Big East semifinal, so it won't be shown in the 
Southland. If UCLA reaches the semifinals, Channel 2 will take some heat. . . . 
Prime Ticket will televise one Big West semifinal Saturday night at 7, ESPN the 
other at 9. 
</P>
<P>
CBS will address the problems plaguing college athletics in a half-hour show 
Saturday at 10 a.m. James Brown will monitor a round-table discussion with Dick 
Shultz, the executive director of the NCAA; Nolan Richardson, Arkansas 
basketball coach; Father William Beauchamp, Notre Dame's executive vice 
president, and Sports Illustrated's Curry Kirkpatrick. Brown, who was a 
basketball star at Harvard, said he would like to see more restraint on sports. 
"The college presidents need to put the reins on sports and return to the days 
of student-athletes instead of the athlete-students we have today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It would seem that ESPN and CBS might start putting some pressure on baseball 
to end the lockout, considering the money at stake. . . . ESPN has already 
scheduled replacement programming for spring training telecasts scheduled this 
month in prime time (early evening in the West). The dates are March 20, 25, 27 
and 29. The March 20 replacement programming is live NIT action, March 25 is 
NCAA wrestling, March 27 is college baseball and March 29 is auto racing. . . . 
If and when they do start playing at Dodger Stadium, KNX's Pete Arbogast will 
be the public-address announcer. He replaces Nick Nickson, who resigned because 
of increased involvement as the Kings' radio and TV commentator. 
</P>
<P>
CBS will devote two hours of prime time Saturday night, 8 to 10, to the World 
Figure Skating Championships. . . . CBS will televise the Lakers' game at 
Atlanta Sunday at 9 a.m. . . . It was announced this week that many Oakland 
Raiders of the 1970s, such as Ken Stabler, Mark van Eeghen and Ben Davidson, 
will play a flag football game against a team of Dallas Cowboys of the '70s in 
Oakland on July 26. Highlights will be televised on NBC two days later. 
</P>
<P>
KFWB reporter Sharon Katchen should get hazardous-duty pay for covering the Los 
Angeles Marathon. She ran the course carrying a six-pound cellular backpack 
and, despite suffering from a severe sinus infection, finished in 6 hours 50 
minutes. . . . Rick Kulis, Southern California pay-per-view executive, says he 
has purchased 40% of the struggling Las Vegas Silver Streaks of the World 
Basketball League. Kulis, chief executive officer of Torrance-based Choice 
Entertainment, said he paid about $200,000 for the interest in the Las Vegas 
franchise of the under 6-foot-5 league. The Silver Streaks were run by the 
league last year, and the WBL will maintain a 60% share of the franchise. The 
team begins its home season May 14.

Mike Redhair scored a career-high 18 points Thursday night, leading Arizona 
State to a 57-51 victory over Washington in the first round of the Pacific 10 
Conference tournament at Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
A senior guard from Tucson, Redhair made only six of 16 shots, including five 
of a tournament-record 14 three-point attempts, but nailed two three-pointers 
to spark a 10-0 run that lifted ASU in the last 2:01, propelling the Sun Devils 
(14-14) into a quarterfinal game today against top-seeded Oregon State (22-5). 
</P>
<P>
Center Doug West scored 17 points to lead Washington (11-17), which played 
without three-time all-conference guard Eldridge Recasner, who was in New 
Orleans to attend his grandfather's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Meekins, formerly of Crenshaw High, scored 13 points for Washington, and 
Dion Brown, also from Crenshaw, had 12 points and 11 rebounds. JERRY CROWE

Amy Jalewalia scored only eight points as the La Quinta High School girls' 
basketball team lost to top-seeded Point Loma, 39-36, Thursday in a Southern 
California Division II Regional semifinal at Point Loma. 
</P>
<P>
Jalewalia, the second-leading girls' scorer in the state with a 34-point 
average, fouled out on a charging call with 3 minutes 36 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"She hasn't scored that low since her freshman year," La Quinta Coach Kevin 
Kiernan said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Jalewalia: "I was off. I tried to do too much. I was getting the shots, I 
just got flustered, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
Robin Rabello, a 6-foot senior center, scored a season-high 12 points, pulled 
down 13 rebounds -- seven in the first quarter -- and had three steals for 
Point Loma (29-3). 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma trailed, 36-35, when Tyeast Brown scored off her own rebound and 
gave the Pointers a 37-36 lead with a minute remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma called a timeout, and after missed shots by both teams, Point Loma's 
Stacy Wainwright was fouled with 13 seconds left, but she missed the front end 
of the one-and-one. Rabello was in perfect position, grabbed the rebound and 
scored to give Point Loma a 39-36 lead. La Quinta shot from three-point range, 
but was way off target.

HUSTON PULLS OFF SHOES, THEN PULLS OFF FEAT: 68 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Huston overcame howling winds and an unusual ruling Thursday to take a 
two-stroke lead in the first round of the Honda Classic at Coral Springs, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Huston, forced into new shoes by decree of the U.S. Golf Assn., birdied his 
last two holes for a four-under-par 68 on the TPC at Eagle Trace course. Winds 
gusted up to 45 m.p.h. during the round. 
</P>
<P>
"On a day like this, that 68 is really more like a 65 or 64," said British Open 
champion Mark Calcavecchia, who is two shots back in second place. 
</P>
<P>
"With winds like this, anything under 75 is a good score. It was not 
unplayable, but it was very, very tough." 
</P>
<P>
It was Huston's shoes that were unplayable. Or at least illegal, according to 
the USGA, golf's rule-making body in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Huston shoes, Weight-Rite, feature a wedge on the outside edge, which forces 
the body's weight to the inside of the foot, the desirable position for hitting 
a golf shot. 
</P>
<P>
However, the USGA said the shoe violated rule 14-3B, which prohibits a player 
from using "an artificial device or equipment" which would aid him in making a 
stroke. 
</P>
<P>
Huston was informed only moments before his morning tee time. He made a quick 
visit to the pro shop, purchased a pair of more conventional shoes and went 
about his business. 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia, a playoff loser last week at Doral, sank an 80-yard wedge shot 
for an eagle-two on the 14th hole and finished with a round of 70. 
</P>
<P>
Gil Morgan, Tim Simpson, Mark Brooks and Joel Edwards each shot 71. They were 
the only other players in the 144-man field to break par. 
</P>
<P>
Two-time U.S. Open champion Curtis Strange, making his first start in this 
country in two months, had a 74. 
</P>
<P>
The wind-blown scores were extremely high, with more than two dozen players at 
80 or higher. Among them was an amateur, 16-year-old high school junior Chris 
Couch, who shot 82. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's Toru Nakamura shot a three-under-par 69 in the wind to take a 
one-stroke lead in the Imperial tournament in Sakuragawamura, Japan. American 
David Ishii, winner of the Hawaiian Open, shot a 75.

Santa Clara 77, Laguna Beach 48 -- After a 140-mile trip to Ventura College, 
the Artists never got on track and lost to the defending state champions. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach (23-7) went 11 minutes 30 seconds from the end of the first 
quarter until the opening minutes of the third quarter without scoring a field 
goal and fell behind, 38-12. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Shon Tarver scored Santa Clara's first 12 points and then put on a show, 
scoring 39 points on a variety of drives, dunks and three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
Tarver, who has narrowed his college choices to Notre Dame, Nevada Las Vegas, 
UCLA, Syracuse and Georgia Tech, made 15 of 24 shots and was five of eight at 
the free-throw line. Tarver's final basket was his most spectacular, a dunk off 
an alley-oop pass before he left the game with 4:19 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara (26-0), which hasn't lost a game since losing to Huntington Beach 
Edison in December of 1988, won its 32nd in a row. TOM HAMILTON

Rancho Santiago College's pressure defense, well-known around Southern 
California, got some statewide recognition Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Dons forced 25 turnovers and defeated American River, 86-66, in the 
quarterfinals of the state tournament in front of 500 at UC Irvine's Bren 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
American River had only eight turnovers in the first half, but Rancho Santiago 
led, 42-38. 
</P>
<P>
American River was sloppy in the second half. Guard Brian Jang had an 
especially tough time with seven turnovers. He had nine in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Morphew's basket for American River about a minute into the second half 
cut the lead to 42-40, but Rancho Santiago took off from there. 
</P>
<P>
Morphew, who scored a game-high 27, got his fourth foul, diving for a loose 
ball, with 15:13 left. 
</P>
<P>
Although he returned three minutes later, Rancho Santiago took advantage of his 
absence for a 11-0 run to lead, 62-45. 
</P>
<P>
American River could only get as close as 10 points the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago will play El Camino at 8 tonight in one semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
Chabot plays Merced in the other semifinal at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago was led by center Matt Lien, a 6-foot-9 sophomore, and forward 
Corie Blount, a 6-9 freshman. 
</P>
<P>
Lien scored 25 points and had eight rebounds, both team highs. Blount had 20 
points, six rebounds and four steals. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to work hard to get open because of their zone," said Lien, who has 
signed to attend California. "It was our defense that made our offense go. We 
didn't have any special plan. We just played hard at both ends like we have all 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Lien was nine of 14 from the field and Blount was eight of 10. Both were three 
inches taller than any of American River's starters. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Gene Altamirano was the only other Rancho Santiago player in double 
figures with 14. Altamirano, a 56% shooter from the field this season, was five 
of 14, including four of 12 on three-pointers. He missed his five shots in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
"For us to beat good teams we have to get big games from Matt, Corie and Gene," 
Rancho Santiago Coach Dana Pagett said. "They are our all-conference players 
and they came through. But we had several people play well tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Vern Broadnax, a freshman point guard, had only four points but added eight 
assists and three steals for Rancho Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gives the Dons (30-3) their first 30-victory season in the history 
of the program, which started in 1921. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago's most victories prior to this season came in 1986-87 when the 
Dons were 29-5 and lost to Saddleback in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
In the other quarterfinals: 
</P>
<P>
El Camino 97, West Valley 90 -- El Camino (24-10) started the playoffs as the 
23rd-seeded team in the south and has reached the semifinals with four 
consecutive upsets. West Valley ends 29-3. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Lockley led El Camino with 21 points, Jamal Ross had 19 and David Keeter 
18. Wiley Thomas had 23 for West Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Chabot 90, Moorpark 79 -- Tony Amundsen scored 29 points on nine-of-13 shooting 
to lead Chabot (25-7). 
</P>
<P>
Scott Kelly added 21 and Darin Amin 20 for Chabot, which led at the half, 
36-32. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Crawford had 26 for Moorpark (24-11). 
</P>
<P>
Merced 73, Imperial Valley 70 -- O.J. Bonner blocked a shot with 37 seconds 
left and made two free throws two seconds later to give Merced (23-10) a 73-70 
lead. Imperial Valley (32-2) missed three three-pointers in the final 10 
seconds.

BIG WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT;

FRESNO STATE SHUTS DOWN MILLER TO BEAT THE TITANS

<P>
Cal State Fullerton had to contend with Simone Srubek, Fresno State's 
6-foot-6-inch center. And Fresno State had to contend with the Titans' Genia 
Miller, who is 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
In two other games this season, Fresno State has been content to play Miller 
straight up and try to stop the other Fullerton players. 
</P>
<P>
But after an eight-point loss to the Titans late last month, Fresno State 
decided the thing to do was to concentrate on Miller. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs did just that Thursday, holding Miller to two points in the first 
half and taking a 17-point halftime lead en route to a 72-60 victory in a 
quarterfinal game of the Big West Conference women's basketball tournament at 
Long Beach Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State (19-10) advances to a semifinal game Saturday against UNLV, a 
102-67 winner over San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
With Srubek playing behind Miller and with Stacey Cornaggia fronting her, 
Fresno State held Miller to 15 points and six rebounds, far below her averages 
of 24 points and 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Miller took only three shots in the first half as Fresno State jumped to leads 
of 17-2 and 27-8. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost the game in the first five minutes," said Fullerton Coach Maryalyce 
Jeremiah, whose team finished the season with a 14-14 record. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Werth, a Fullerton forward left open because of the double team, scored 
27 points, but made only 11 of 30 shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hesitant about shooting in the first half," Werth said. "I couldn't 
believe how open I was. When we don't have our big girl Genia scoring, it's 
really tough." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton also tried to break down the Bulldogs' collapsing defense from 
outside, but made only two of 17 three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
Cornaggia led Fresno State with 18 points, making all eight shots she attempted 
and both free throws. Geri Gainey added 14 and Srubek had 12. ROBYN NORWOOD

<P>
Karl Malone scored 27 points as the Utah Jazz beat Chicago, 98-94, ending the 
Bulls' nine-game winning streak Thursday night at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was the Bulls' third at home in 26 games. It was the Jazz' ninth 
victory in 10 games and improved its road record to 15-14. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordan scored 43 points for the Bulls and Scottie Pippen added 24. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls battled from 19 points down to within 96-94 with three seconds left 
on two free throws by Jordan, but Malone made two foul shots with two seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Thurl Bailey added 22 points for Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 111, Seattle 97 -- Akeem Olajuwon scored 16 of his 30 points in the 
third quarter at Houston to lead the Rockets to their fifth consecutive 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Rockets still trail the SuperSonics by 1 1/2 games in the fight for the 
final playoff berth in the Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Olajuwon, who hit 14 of 19 shots and added eight rebounds, ended his 
third-quarter scoring spurt with a short jump shot that gave the Rockets a 
93-84 lead going into the final quarter. Houston pulled away with a 10-2 surge 
to take a 105-92 lead with 4:49 left. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Cage scored 20 points for the SuperSonics and Dana Barros had 19. Buck 
Johnson added 20 points for the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State 145, Cleveland 105 -- Mitch Richmond scored 25 points to lead the 
Warriors at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland lost its sixth consecutive game, all on this trip, and finish the 
long trek Sunday at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland shot 43% in the first half and fell behind, 71-50, at intermission. 
Tim Hardaway had 13 assists in the first half in the Warriors' biggest win by 
point margin this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors started the second half with a 14-2 run to build the lead to 
85-52. 
</P>
<P>
John Williams scored 26 points for Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento 111, Charlotte 102 -- Wayman Tisdale scored 33 points, including 20 
in the third quarter, as the Kings handed the Hornets their 11th consecutive 
road defeat at Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Rex Champan tied his season high of 38 points for Charlotte, which has lost 27 
of 28 road games. 
</P>
<P>
Tisdale had 14 of the Kings' points during a 20-7, six-minute run that gave 
Sacramento the lead for good, 72-62, with 4:25 left in the third quarter.

DOW CLIMBS 26 TO HIGHEST CLOSE SINCE JAN. 11

<P>
The stock market shrugged off concerns about the economy and interest rates 
Thursday, breaking out of its narrow band in the last hour of the session to 
post a handsome gain. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials rose 26.58 points to 2,696.17, its 
highest close since it stood at 2,760.67 on Jan. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last 11 sessions the index sports a gain of just under 132 points, or 
5.1%. 
</P>
<P>
In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 2 to 1 
in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 983 up, 
507 down and 476 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume came to 170.90 million shares, up from Wednesday's 163.58 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Although stocks traded in a narrow range for most of the day, constrained by 
caution before the release of February employment data this morning, anxiety 
appeared to evaporate in mid-afternoon trading. 
</P>
<P>
Rising bond prices, lower interest rates, computer-linked buy programs and 
short-covering spurred the Dow industrials to a smart close, more than 
overcoming the 7.21-point loss Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department's report on employment this morning promises to give 
investors one of the first signposts of the economy's performance in February. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange surged higher this morning, drawing 
strength from technical factors. The blue chip Nikkei 225-share index, gained 
600.54 points, or 1.78% closing the morning session at 34,291.43. On Thursday, 
the Nikkei rose 328.55 points, or 0.98%, to end at 33,690.89. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices rose on London's Stock Exchange as several healthy good corporate 
earnings reports gave the whole market a lift. The Financial Times 100-share 
index rose 19.7 points to close at 2,250.0.

<P>
Bond Prices Mixed in Cautious Trading 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices finished mixed, marking time as most investors waited on the 
sidelines for today's employment figures for February. 
</P>
<P>
Most short-term bonds declined slightly, while longer-term issues advanced. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond gained 5/16 point, or $3.12 for 
every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which declines when the price rises, 
slipped to 8.55% from 8.58% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said trading was very light as most bondholders preferred to stay out 
of the market in advance of the employment report. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing exciting or earth-shattering," said Kevin Flanagan, a money market 
economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "It was another quiet day in front of 
the employment report." 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.313%, up from 8.188% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Edges Up in Jittery Session 
</P>
<P>
The dollar finished mostly higher in extremely quiet domestic trading as 
investors spent the day on the sidelines wary of provoking the central banks to 
intervene. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices slipped in New York after finishing mixed overseas. On the New York 
Commodity Exchange, gold settled at $400 an ounce, off 20 cents from Wednesday. 
Republic National Bank of New York later quoted a bid of $399.80, down 80 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
Currency trading was lackluster worldwide. "The day never really got started," 
said Bob Morrissey, a senior trader with the Bank of Boston in New York. "It 
was almost like a holiday market." 
</P>
<P>
Traders said only one factor dampened activity -- the threat of central bank 
intervention. Dealers were surprised on Wednesday when a group of central banks 
aggressively and repeatedly sold dollars to keep the currency from rising. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve was believed to have entered the market more than once 
Thursday to sell dollars against the Japanese yen, but the action was modest 
compared to the previous session, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, sentiment toward the U.S. currency remains very bullish. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 150.83 Japanese yen, up from 150.75. 
Later in London, the dollar closed at 150.80 yen. But in New York, the dollar 
finished at 151.09 yen, up from 150.35 yen on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, one British pound cost $1.6427 late Thursday, more expensive for 
buyers than Wednesday's late $1.6388. But the dollar gained against the British 
currency in New York, where one pound cost $1.6385, cheaper than $1.6465 on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to Wednesday's late rates 
included: 1.7008 West German marks, up from 1.6982; 1.5080 Swiss francs, up 
from 1.4995; 5.7495 French francs, up from 5.7400; 1,255.25 Italian lire, up 
from 1,252.75, and 1.1807 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1831.

Meat Futures Rise on Supply Worries 
</P>
<P>
Livestock and meat prices surged for the third consecutive session at the 
Chicago Mercantile Exchange amid concerns about tight hog supplies. 
</P>
<P>
On other futures markets, grains rallied, but gold, energy products and orange 
juice contracts all declined. 
</P>
<P>
At the Chicago Merc, the frozen pork bellies contract for delivery in March 
rose the daily limit of 2 cents after four contracts posted the maximum 
increases allowed in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
"The market is reflecting an insufficient supply of hogs to satisfy packer 
needs," said Chuck Levitt, an analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"Packers simply don't have the hogs they need, and the consumer and investor 
are paying more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The advance in cattle futures prices "was mainly a spillover from the strong 
pork complex," Levitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Cattle settled 0.30 to 0.70 cent higher, with the contract for delivery in 
April at 77.27 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 0.25 to 0.85 cent higher, with 
March at 81.87 cents a pound; live hogs were 0.05 to 0.65 cent higher, with 
April at 52.07 cents a pound, and frozen pork bellies were 0.37 cent to 2.00 
cents higher, with March at 50.95 cents a pound.

K mart Corp.: The giant retailer posted a fourth-quarter loss of $20.5 million, 
contrasted with a profit of $393.2 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Sales climbed 16% to $9.75 billion. For 1990, earnings at the the Troy, Mich., 
firm plummeted 60% to $322.7 million on sales of $29.5 billion, up 8% from 
1989. The firm, which also owns Waldenbooks, Pay Less Drug Stores, Pace 
Membership Warehouse and other retail properties, attributed the quarterly 
results to a $640.1-million charge linked to a $2.3-billion program to 
restructure its discount stores. Net interest expense on debt was up 31% to 
$181 million.

WESTERN SAYS THEY DO COSTUMES RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As president of Western Costume Co., I would like to take exception to the way 
our company was portrayed in the article, "Gone With Neglect" by Gaile Robinson 
on Feb. 23. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson is evidently ignorant of the difference between what she refers to as 
a "rental shop" and one of the great costume houses of the world, which Western 
has been and will continue to be. 
</P>
<P>
We create costumes with some of the finest craftsmen and designers in the 
industry for stars and films acclaimed throughout the world. We do a lot more 
than "rent." 
</P>
<P>
While it is true there have been abuses and neglect of Hollywood's artifacts, 
no credit was given to those of us who, at considerable expenditure of time and 
money, are trying to preserve what remains of the past as well as the treasures 
of the present for the future. My partners and I have been refurbishing and 
rebuilding our collection so that it will be here for future generations. Our 
costumes will not be "Gone With Neglect" but, instead, "Preserved With Love."

'LITTLEST INTERPRETERS' GROW UP FAST, BUT THE BENEFITS CAN BE MANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My family came to this country from Hong Kong in 1975 when I was 11. No one of 
the four in the family spoke English. 
</P>
<P>
With a younger brother who has chronic asthma and a mother who has a congenital 
heart problem, I can claim to have made the rounds to all the major hospitals 
in L.A., translating all sorts of symptoms from Chinese to English. 
</P>
<P>
On one trip to the gynecologist's office for my mother's annual exam, the 
doctor, male, asked, "How often do you and your husband have sexual 
intercourse?" I thought, "Yeah, I'm going to ask my mom that?" I looked at my 
mom, and she's waiting to find out what this next question was, and I said to 
the doctor, "They don't." The doctor looked at me -- age 13 and blushing in 
tomato red -- and went on to an easier question. 
</P>
<P>
Children such as Adriana, Claudia, Faustino and Iran are often exposed to many 
situations adults handle by themselves. From my own experience, this exposure 
makes growing up fast. And I can't say it's bad. The little interpreters get a 
firsthand look at what the adult world is about.

INTO THE NIGHT: NO VOLCANIC ACTIVITY AT PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HIGGINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Scene: The West Coast premiere of Warner Bros. "Joe vs. the Volcano" at the 
Mann Regent in Westwood, followed by a party next door at Stratton's Grill, 
hosted by the William Morris Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: The film's star, Tom Hanks, writer-director John Patrick 
Shanley, and co-stars Abe Vigoda and Robert Stack; plus guests Dennis Hopper, 
John Goodman and Molly Ringwald. Also on hand were two current all-stars of the 
Hollywood ex-wives league -- Bruce Springsteen's ex Julianne Phillips and Mimi 
Rogers, former Mrs. Tom Cruise. 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz: Since when do talent agencies host premiere parties? William Morris 
seemed to be going all out to show its sincere, undying, selfless love for 
clients Hanks and Stanley. Either that, or they're preparing to branch out into 
catering. 
</P>
<P>
The Chow: Salmon with Dijon dill Hollandaise; saffron linguine with rock 
shrimp; grilled breast of chicken with lemon caper butter sauce; hot fudge 
sundaes for the caloric fearless. 
</P>
<P>
Dress Mode: The usual acres of Italian wool from Armani and Versace. One woman 
was wearing a black see-through blouse over a multicolored brassiere. When she 
noticed another guest was fixated on her chest, she pulled her jacket shut. The 
gentleman apologized, saying he stared only because "I was once a fashion 
student at Otis Parsons." 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: "Saturday Night Live's" Victoria Jackson: "When Meg Ryan graduates to 
playing heroin addicts, I want to take over all her together-but-slightly 
askew, offbeat leading lady roles." 
</P>
<P>
Missed Opportunity: With a film that includes a volcano and a South Seas island 
whose inhabitants are descendants of Jewish, Italian and Irish sailors, this 
could have been the theme party of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Glitches: It looked like a casting call for bit players in "The Famous Teddy 
Z." Few stars went to the party, leaving Stratton's packed with agents. 
</P>

<P>
Photo, Star Tom Hanks commented: "This is a very unorthodox movie told in a 
highly visual style. Nobody has seen this type of movie in a long time." MIKE 
MEADOWS / Los Angeles Times; Photo, Victoria Jackson and Abe Vigoda discussed 
the film at premiere party. Said Jackson: "I thought it was deeply symbolic in 
a quirky, funny way." Film co-star Vigoda noted, "I usually play Mafia members 
or detectives; this is my first time as chief of a Polynesian island. This is 
the first time I've worked with a volcano." ; Photo, Julianne Phillips, ex-wife 
of rocker Bruce Springsteen, attended the premiere for the movie "Joe vs. the

'LITTLEST INTERPRETERS' GROW UP FAST, BUT THE BENEFITS CAN BE MANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was particularly interested in "The Littlest Interpreters" (March 1) because 
I have some experience in this area, though not with Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
Eight years ago a great number of Vietnamese moved into our area and I became 
their friend. 
</P>
<P>
All of the children acted as interpreters for their parents, and they often 
sought help from me when they didn't understand a letter or had trouble with 
the landlord. 
</P>
<P>
I take exception to the experts who claim that these children may develop 
resentment toward their parents and that this is too much responsibility for 
children. 
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, these kids benefit greatly and I feel certain that it 
strengthens the bond between parent and child. The child gains an important 
place in the family. He feels needed and capable. I recently had the pleasure 
of watching a child doing the family shopping alone. He swept down the aisles, 
handling money and coupons with an aplomb that few possess. 
</P>
<P>
Supposedly, the average American has difficulty filling out a job application. 
Not these lucky children. By the time they are ready for college, they are 
experts. They take care of their own college applications and financial 
statements. They are ready to take their place as responsible, caring adults 
because they practiced as they went along.

Five years ago the Orange County Auto Show outgrew Anaheim Convention Center 
and was moved to the Anaheim Stadium parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Since then attendance has steadily climbed, going over the 200,000 mark this 
year. Since 1986, nearly 800,000 people have attended the show. However, the 
annual percentage increase in attendance fell precipitously this year, to less 
than half last year's mark.

Red-Winged Blackbird 
</P>
<P>
(Agelaius phoeniceus) 
</P>
<P>
Description: Males are glossy black with red shoulder patches broadly tipped 
with pale yellow. Females are dark brown above, heavily streaked below and 
sometimes show a red tinge on wing coverts or pinkish wash on chin and throat. 
</P>
<P>
Habitat: Prefers thick vegetation in freshwater marshes, sloughs, and fields. 
Forages in nearby fields, orchards and woodlands. 
</P>
<P>
Diet: Insects, seeds. 
</P>
<P>
Displays: While elevated on vegetation, male spreads tail, droops wings, raises 
colored patches, fluffs feathers, leans forward with head pointing downward and 
sings. He also uses a slow, stalling song flight with tail spread, head down. 
</P>
<P>
Nest: Near or over water on emergent vegetation or shrubs. It's made of sedges, 
grass and lined with fine grass and rushes. Built in three to six days. 
</P>
<P>
Eggs: Pale bluish-green, marked with dark colors. About one inch long. 
</P>
<P>
Breeding bird atlas: To report bird breeding activity in your neighborhood, or 
to get information on the breeding bird atlas, call Sea and Sage Audubon 
Society members Sylvia Gallagher, (714) 962-8990, or Nancy Kenyon, (714) 
786-3160. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Map is divided into 5-kilometer squares so that Audubon Society 
volunteers can more easily survey areas on a regular basis.

Now is the time to prune camellias and azaleas, after they have finished 
blooming. Prune for shape and take out dead wood. 
</P>
<P>
* Prune all cane-type and shrub-like begonias. Remove about two-thirds of the 
plant and cut back lightly on watering until plant begins to leaf out. 
</P>
<P>
* Clean up and lightly cut back all ivy and zonal geraniums to promote new, 
compact growth. 
</P>
<P>
* Apply a slow-release fertilizer like Osmocote 14-14-14 to all outdoor 
container plants. Garden pests such as aphids, white fly and slugs begin to 
show up now. Take appropriate control measures and check roses for powdery 
mildew and black spot. Spray with fungicide if needed. 
</P>
<P>
* March is the time to plant hybrid lilies. 
</P>
<P>
* If part of your vegetable garden doesn't receive full sun all day, in those 
areas plant carrots, radishes, chives, beets or lettuce because they're grown 
for their roots or foliage. 
</P>
<P>
* March is a good month to plant citrus of all kinds: oranges, lemons, limes or 
grapefruit. If space is limited, try a dwarf citrus tree in a container on the 
patio. 
</P>
<P>
* Consider planting vegetables in containers like hanging baskets or hanging 
wooden barrels. 
</P>
<P>
* March is a good time to plant a new lawn. Conditioning the soil first can 
mean tremendous savings in the future. Adding humus helps release nutrients and 
helps the soil hold water, air and food. If soil is sandy, humus keeps food and 
water from rushing past the roots. Work the humus into the soil along with a 
starter fertilizer. Rake and roll the soil several times, taking care not to 
compact. 
</P>
<P>
* Snails can live up to 20 years, and breed faster than rabbits. Keep them from 
taking over your garden by using one of the extremely effective baits 
available. 
</P>
<P>
* Some come in liquid spray form, others in pellets or granules. Be careful 
when using the poisonous baits around small children or pets. 
</P>
<P>
* When planting new azaleas, select varieties to ensure proper color and growth 
characteristics for your garden. Plant in shaded or semi-shaded areas in 
well-draining soil on the acidic side. Take care not to plant deeper than the 
plant was in its original nursery container, and preferably on a mound of soil. 
Keep moist, but not overly wet. Specially-formulated fertilizers are available. 
</P>
<P>
* Brighten borders with annuals. Use tall larkspurs and giant snapdragons as 
background for stock, petunias, alyssum and dwarf marigolds. Experiment by 
combining shrubs and perennials. 
</P>
<P>
* It's feeding time for lawns, shrubs and roses. Before fertilizing a lawn, try 
spiking or aerating to improve water penetration. Feed roses and flowering 
shrubs at one-to-two-week intervals. Scatter one-half cup or so of a 
well-balanced fertilizer in a basin around each plant and work in with a hand 
trowel or fork.

EL CAMINO STAYS CLOSE BUT FALLS TO NO. 1-RANKED ARTESIA, 74-70

<P>
Artesia's 1,200-seat gym was a prime setting for a big-time blowout. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV Coach Jerry Tarkanian was courtside to watch Artesia star Ed O'Bannon. The 
lights were lowered before the game, a la UNLV's Thomas and Mack Center, and 
the red-clad Artesia crowd sounded more like 12,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
The El Camino Wildcats didn't spoil all the fun for No. 1-ranked Artesia 
Thursday night in the Southern California Division II Regional semifinals -- 
they lost, 74-70 -- but they definitely made Artesia and its fans sweat a 
little. 
</P>
<P>
In its past 14 games, all victories, Artesia's closest margin was 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people thought we were going to come up here, and they were going to 
whup us," El Camino Shaun Scurry said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Bannon had his customary big game -- 30 points, 14 rebounds, four blocks -- 
but the blowout just didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
"I know not many people believed we could come in here and beat these guys, but 
kids believed they could win the game," El Camino Coach Ray Johnson said. "We 
proved they were human." 
</P>
<P>
El Camino (23-7) trailed almost the entire game -- its last lead was at 5-3 -- 
but it kept hanging around and actually had a couple chances to gain control 
early in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
After trailing, 34-30, at halftime, El Camino closed to within 41-38 on a Dee 
Boyer layup with 5:38 remaining in the third quarter. Then the Wildcats fell 
behind by seven, but Heath McCoy's jumper and free throws put El Camino within 
three at 1:44. 
</P>
<P>
"We could just never seem to get over the hump," Johnson said. "We couldn't get 
that one break that we needed." 
</P>
<P>
And it couldn't get its shooters, Glen Ankton and Travis Gilley, going. But 
most of that was caused by the tough pressure defense of Artesia guards Chris 
Thompson and DeAndre Austin. 
</P>
<P>
Gilley, averaging 22 points, made two for 12 field goals and finished with 10 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Ankton, averaging 18, was a miserable one for 13 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
"With a player like O'Bannon behind them, they can get up on you and play 
pretty aggressively," Gilley said. "I kept trying to get a three-pointer, but 
they just wouldn't go down. It got frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
Although Gilley and Ankton struggled with their shooting, they pressured Austin 
and Thompson into numerous turnovers and helped out with O'Bannon inside. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, McCoy and Boyer took over the shooting duties. McCoy came off the 
bench to score all 14 of his points in the second half, and Boyer had a 
team-high 17. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino trailed, 53-44, after three quarters and fell behind by 12 before 
cutting the lead to 66-60 with 1:20 remaining. O'Bannon made six consecutive 
free throws in the last minute to give Artesia (27-2) a 70-60 lead with 45 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
But Jeff Reeves and McCoy hit three-pointers, and Gilley hit two free throws 
after a steal to make it 72-68 with 20 seconds left. Then Austin hit two free 
throws with 13 seconds remaining to seal it.

MT. CARMEL NO MATCH FOR MORNINGSIDE, LESLIE

In Lisa Leslie's final home game at Morningside High School Thursday night, the 
Monarchs were afforded the surprising luxury of an easy victory, beating Mt. 
Carmel, 78-42, in the semifinals of the Southern California Regional Division I 
girls' basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside (30-3), with 22 points from Leslie and 19 from sophomore Janet 
Davis, will play Friday at 6:30 p.m. at the Sports Arena for the championship 
and the right to defend its State Division I title in Oakland next week. 
</P>
<P>
"We were able to rest some people, especially Lisa and Janet," Coach Frank 
Scott said, "which is nice with another game coming up so soon." 
</P>
<P>
Vicki de Jesus scored 18 points for Mt. Carmel (23-6), which advanced to the 
semifinals with an upset at Hart Tuesday night. Mt. Carmel never led and was 
unable to get to within 10 points of Morningside from early in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie, who scored 101 points in one half of a game earlier this season, 
admitted that the Monarchs did almost whatever they wanted against the 
Sundevils but added: "They gave us a good game. I wish we had teams this 
competitive in our league." 
</P>
<P>
Leslie made seven of 20 field-goal attempts, with 12 rebounds and eight blocked 
shots. "My shot was wasn't falling like it normally would," she said, "but I 
was glad to see Janet and my other teammates get into the offense." 
</P>
<P>
Bridgete Williams, a starting junior guard for Morningside, suffered torn 
ligaments in her lower leg in an accident at home earlier in the day, was 
placed in a cast and is out for the season. Junior Tyesha Whiting, starting in 
her place, scored six points. Princess Murray scored 12, all on four 
three-pointers.

David Aupont spent his 12th birthday fighting for his life in a New York City 
hospital after a bully allegedly beat him with a bat, tied him up, soaked him 
with gasoline and set him afire in a garage because he refused to smoke crack. 
While David couldn't celebrate, former President Ronald Reagan, the White House 
and Mayor David N. Dinkins were among well-wishers who showered him with cards, 
gifts, balloons, flowers and messages, a hospital spokeswoman said. A suspect 
just a year older than David was arrested and charged in the attack.

U.S. and Soviet negotiators reported major progress in Geneva toward an 
agreement on deep cuts in stockpiles of lethal nerve gas and other chemical 
weapons that could be signed at the June summit. The superpowers also agreed on 
mutual inspections of facilities for "safe, speedy and also economically and 
ecologically sound" destruction of stockpiled weapons. Another round of talks 
will begin around April 23 and the two sides are confident about having the 
accord ready for President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev when 
they meet in late June in the United States, officials said.

Communist rebels killed an elderly American rancher on the central Philippine 
island of Masbate after he refused to pay "revolutionary taxes," officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Stewart Frank Raab, was the second American killed by Filipino 
rebels in a month and the fifth in the past year. Raab, 76, was seized Tuesday 
by about 30 New People's Army guerrillas at his ranch near Milagros, 240 miles 
southeast of Manila, a military spokesman said by telephone from Masbate. Raab, 
who was born in the Philippines when it was still an American colony, had been 
paying "revolutionary taxes" -- or protection money -- until the rebels 
increased the fee to $34,000 a year.

China increased security patrols and virtually sealed off Tibet on the first 
anniversary of the imposition of martial law. 
</P>
<P>
Travel agents in Chengdu, China's main gateway to Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, 
said tours have been canceled and that travel permits will not be issued until 
March 15. Despite the tension, there were no reports of renewed protests by 
Tibetan nationalists. Authorities did allow Tibet's Buddhist monks to continue 
a major prayer festival that has been the occasion of anti-Chinese protests in 
the past. The 10-day festival, which began last week, provoked last year's 
anti-Beijing riots that led to martial law.

CSUN WOMEN WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE OF TOP 
</P>

<P>
In the past three NCAA Division II national championships, the Cal State 
Northridge women's swim team never completed a day anywhere but atop the 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
That streak was broken on the first day of this year's meet and the trend 
continued Thursday at the State University of New York at Buffalo natatorium. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Lady Matadors, who started the day in second place, dropped a 
notch. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge has 170 points, trailing front-runner Navy (175) and North Dakota 
(171). 
</P>
<P>
And, considering the circumstances, Coach Pete Accardy could not be more 
pleased. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to be within 20 points today and we're within four (actually five)," 
Accardy said. "Psychologically, that's a big lift. This was supposed to be by 
far our worst day and we're actually closer to the lead than we were 
yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
A victory in the 800-yard freestyle relay, Northridge's first win of the meet, 
pulled the Lady Matadors into the thick of title contention. 
</P>
<P>
The top six teams are separated by 18 points. Eight points behind CSUN is Cal 
Poly San Luis Obispo. Oakland (Mich.) (158) and Northern Michigan (157) follow. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Sulak opened the 800 relay in 1 minute 52.16 seconds to leave the 
competition in Northridge's wake. The Lady Matadors, who won in 7:33.56, also 
received strong segments from Toady Kimble (1:52.56), Lisa Dial (1:54.48) and 
Mara Morgan (1:54.36). 
</P>
<P>
Morgan was CSUN's only individual championship finalist during the evening's 
other three events. She placed seventh in the 200-yard butterfly with a 
personal-best 2:07.06. Sulak won the consolation title in the same event in 
2:06.85. 
</P>
<P>
Northern Michigan picked up wins from Kirsten Silverster in the butterfly 
(2:04.37) and Jennifer Kleemann in the 100-yard backstroke (58.59). 
</P>
<P>
Marion Warner of North Dakota took the 100-yard breaststroke championship in 
1:05.56. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's competition, a strong second-place showing in the 800-yard 
freestyle relay kept Northridge in third place with 161.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Bakersfield, which won the relay in a Division II-record 6:37.87, led 
in the team race with with 359 points. Oakland is second with 342 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
For the second night in a row, CSUN's top individual performance was turned in 
by John Kunishima, who placed second in the 100-yard backstroke. 
</P>
<P>
Kunishima set a Division II record in the 200-yard individual medley in the 
meet's opening night. On Thursday, it took a similar effort to defeat him. 
</P>
<P>
Brady Stauffer, a junior from Shippensburg (Pa.), set a Division II standard of 
50.43 to win the race. Kunishima came in at 51.37, a personal best.

Kunishima later turned in a 200-yard split of 1:37.33, the fastest of the 
night, during the 800 relay. 
</P>
<P>
Only a week ago, the sophomore from Hacienda Heights wasn't even sure he would 
compete in the nationals. Kunishima pulled a back muscle and it bothered him 
for several days. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he lost valuable training time during the winter because of 
tendinitis in the area of his right biceps. 
</P>
<P>
"Genuinely, I'm just happy to be here," Kunishima said. "And to do as well as 
I'm doing, I'm just elated. This is a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Pentlarge, a junior from Westlake Village, was CSUN's only other finalist 
Thursday. He was sixth in the 200-yard butterfly in 1:51.54. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Bures of Bakersfield won the race in 1:48.40, breaking the previous 
national record by more than a second.

MORGAN THROWN OFF COURSE;

<P>
NORTHRIDGE: FRESHMAN FIGHTING A CASE OF THE NERVES IN HER FIRST NATIONAL MEET.

<P>
If Mara Morgan's starts were slow, her turns poor, her stroke sloppy and her 
kick a couple of beats off, Pete Accardy, Cal State Northridge swim coach, 
would be a happy man. 
</P>
<P>
Those are mistakes he can see, techniques he can correct. 
</P>
<P>
But what to do with a swimmer whose only inherent problem is that she thinks 
too much? 
</P>
<P>
Such is the case with Morgan, a freshman so gifted that in one December meet 
she posted NCAA Division II bests in the 1,650-yard freestyle, 200-yard 
backstroke and 400-yard individual medley -- three strikingly different races. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the first day of the Division II swimming and diving 
championships at the State University of New York at Buffalo natatorium, Morgan 
finished a distant eighth in the 500-yard freestyle, one of her best events. 
</P>
<P>
Her time of 5 minutes 5.91 seconds was some 10 seconds slower than her time as 
a junior in high school. 
</P>
<P>
Accardy, who prides himself on teaching the correct mental approach to 
swimming, was unable to offer a concrete explanation. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he pointed to his head. 
</P>
<P>
"This is her first national meet and it's obviously affecting her," he said. 
"She's having trouble sleeping. All the things you hope don't happen are 
happening. I think she's just too nervous." 
</P>
<P>
All of which is causing CSUN's coach a few anxious moments of his own. 
</P>
<P>
Accardy believes that Northridge's chances of a fourth consecutive women's team 
title rest largely on how Morgan performs in the meet's final two days. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need her or anyone else to win anything, but we really need just 
about everybody to get into the finals," Accardy said. "If we do that, we 
should be OK." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Morgan has obliged. Even her pedestrian finish in the 500 was worth 11 
points to the Lady Matadors, who are locked in a five-way battle for the team 
title. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, she placed seventh in the 200-yard butterfly -- picking up 12 more 
points -- then helped CSUN win the 800-yard freestyle relay by swimming a 
strong 1:54.36 anchor leg. 
</P>
<P>
Still left on her itinerary are the 400-yard individual medley today and the 
200-yard backstroke on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are two good events for her, so we'll see if she can turn it around," 
Accardy said. "It's not that she's swimming poorly, but I know she's capable of 
doing a lot better. I think she needs to get excited about competing here 
instead of maybe (being) a little afraid." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Morgan described herself as "worried" and "stressed out" before 
Wednesday's race. But she still shaved more than two seconds off her personal 
best in the 200 butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan would like to think that performance -- although it fell short of her 
expectations -- will initiate a breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
Despite an increasingly difficult training regimen, her times have remained in 
neutral for the better part of two years. 
</P>
<P>
"After a while, you ask yourself why," Morgan said. "You know you worked just 
as hard or harder than you did last year, but it's like you're not going 
anywhere. You start doubting yourself. It's hard to get that confidence back 
and start going faster." 
</P>
<P>
But Accardy believed he had recruited an impact swimmer when he plucked Morgan 
out of tiny Livermore, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
A slow start at Morgan's first national meet has not altered his opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a matter of changing her emotional outlook, the way she views 
herself swimming and how she competes," Accardy said. "In December, we thought 
we had solved that, but in this meet she has again looked tentative. 
</P>
<P>
"I know physically she's in much better shape, but she's not swimming as well. 
She doesn't look like she feels good in the water. But the good athletes, the 
champions, fight through that." 
</P>
<P>
Although Morgan hesitates to admit it, she doesn't feel right. 
</P>
<P>
However, she knows that can no longer be considered an excuse for a poor 
performance. The team needs her. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew when I came here I'd be part of a team fighting to win a national 
championship," Morgan said. "I don't feel in top shape, but I have to do what I 
have to do. It doesn't do any good to wish you felt better. It's time to just 
go out and do it."

REFEREE PREPARES TO COUNTERATTACK IN ASSAULT CASE; 
</P>
<P>
PREP FOOTBALL: PLANNED LAWSUIT TARGETS SCHOOL DISTRICT AND PALMDALE COACH FOR 
LACK OF CONTROL IN GAME AGAINST SAUGUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A high school football referee said that he will sue a school district and a 
football coach for what he claims is negligent supervision of the player who 
attacked him during a game between Palmdale and Saugus highs last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Referee Brad Woolley, who sustained minor injuries when he was knocked to the 
ground by Palmdale High player Darius Wilson, said he will file the suit in 
mid-April against Palmdale Coach Kent Bothwell and the Antelope Valley Union 
High School District. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, who already has pleaded no contest to misdemeanor-battery charges and 
received 400 hours of community service work, also will be named in the suit. 
According to Woolley, the inclusion of Bothwell and the school district will be 
to determine who is ultimately accountable for the behavior of players. 
</P>
<P>
Woolley says that National Federation of State High School Assns. guidelines 
clearly state that " 'the responsibility for the conduct of players is 
attributable to the head coach.'It's as simple as that." 
</P>
<P>
The Oct. 13 incident at College of the Canyons occurred in the fourth quarter. 
Woolley, along with two other officials, was attacked by Palmdale players after 
three consecutive penalties against Palmdale. Woolley had flagged Wilson for 
unnecessary roughness on a punt, then called two unsportsmanlike conduct 
penalties when Bothwell "cursed me," Woolley says. "Then all hell broke loose." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the violence, a disturbing aspect of the incident was a charge of 
racism by Palmdale players. Not only were they taunted by racial slurs from the 
Saugus sideline, the players claim, but the referees also made derogatory 
remarks. 
</P>
<P>
But at a hearing before the 10-member Southern Section Executive Committee on 
Wednesday, all five of the referees who worked the game were cleared of any 
misconduct. Palmdale High will not be able to appeal Wednesday's decision at 
the state level but might go to court, according to school Principal Linda 
Janzen. 
</P>
<P>
"I was disappointed in the results of the hearing," she said. "All along, I 
said there were more people responsible than just my players. I still believe 
that. I don't believe they made up the things they're saying." 
</P>
<P>
The Executive Committee voted unanimously to exonerate the referees. "It wasn't 
a matter of not believing one over the other," said committee president Tom 
Jacobson, principal at Corona del Mar High. "We had to look at the whole 
picture in this very messy, unfortunate incident. Was there enough there to 
make a determination? My personal feeling: The evidence was inconclusive." 
</P>
<P>
Woolley believes accusations of racism on the part of referees were "smoke 
screens to draw attention away from the incident." The referees claim they did 
not hear any racist remarks by Saugus players, although independent sources say 
that Saugus players were directing slurs at Palmdale players. In a Jan. 10 
hearing, a Palmdale player testified that Bothwell was apprised of the slurs 
and didn't do anything about it. 
</P>
<P>
"Had the officials been aware of the situation," Woolley said, referring to the 
slurs, "we would have stopped the contest and fixed it. But the Palmdale 
players did not complain to us." 
</P>
<P>
Bothwell is culpable, Woolley said, because he ignored his players' complaints 
and because of his behavior before the incident. From the beginning of the 
game, Woolley said, Bothwell was "complaining about everything, including the 
coin toss." During the game, "he verbally abused the officials. He was not in 
control." 
</P>
<P>
The attacks on the officials happened, Woolley said, because "once verbal abuse 
is accepted, it turns into physical abuse. The players just follow the example 
of their coach." 
</P>
<P>
Bothwell would not comment on the charges. 
</P>
<P>
On March 1, Woolley's attorney, David Rosenberg, set the stages for the lawsuit 
by filing a claim with the school district, a state requirement for suing a 
government agency. The lawsuit will be filed in Lancaster Superior Court. 
Rosenberg won't say how much he's asking in damages, but the minimum amount in 
Superior Court is $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make sure this kind of thing doesn't happen to other sports 
officials," Rosenberg said. "It has to be shown that this is not the way high 
school sports should be run." 
</P>
<P>
Woolley, employed in the wardrobe department at Walt Disney Studios, didn't 
miss work or any officiating assignments because of his injuries. A high school 
referee since 1975, Woolley has been working football games for only four 
years. The Palmdale incident, he said, "got me to the core of my being."

MOORPARK RALLIES PAST CANYONS, 5-4

<P>
Good fortune turned into misfortune for College of the Canyons in the final 
inning of a Western State Conference baseball game against Moorpark on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
After rallying to take a one-run lead in the top of the ninth, the Cougars 
watched Moorpark score twice in the bottom half of the inning for a 5-4 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Suarez, who had gone hitless in four previous at-bats, singled home Donald 
Smith from second base with the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark, which improved its record to 7-7, 3-1 in conference play, can 
sympathize with Canyons. The Raiders have lost four games this season in which 
they led in the final three innings. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a big win for us, we really needed it" Moorpark Coach Ken Wagner 
said. "There is a big difference between being 2-2 and 3-1." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Bannon scored the tying run after reaching base on a bobbled ground ball 
and advanced to third when Canyons pitcher Mike Teich overthrew first base on 
Jason Jones' bunt. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons (11-6, 3-1) took its only lead in the top of the ninth. Bill Horvat 
homered to start the inning and Ron Robart scored the go-ahead run on an 
infield out. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark's Darin Furlong hit for the cycle, including a fifth-inning double 
that scored Henry Shelb to give the Raiders a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Teasdale (4-1) pitched two innings in relief of Moorpark starter Jeff 
Berman to pick up the win. Teich pitched 8 1/3 innings for Canyons, scattering 
nine hits and striking out eight. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons had several opportunities to break the game open but stranded seven 
baserunners in the last three innings. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars, benefiting from three consecutive walks in the sixth inning, 
picked up their first run without a hit. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Fowlks grounded out to score Robart, but Berman retired the next two 
batters in order to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
In other games: 
</P>
<P>
L.A. City 5, Mission 0 -- Daine Turner had two of host Mission's four hits in a 
Southern California Athletic Conference loss. Brad McGahan doubled and Rudy 
Sanchez singled for Mission (9-6-1, 1-1). 
</P>
<P>
Valley 8, Ventura 5 -- Valley's E. J. Pape hit a three-run home run in the 
fifth inning that erased a 3-2 deficit and gave host Valley (6-9-2, 2-1) the 
Western State Conference win. Mark Cavaretta and Pape each had two hits. 
</P>
<P>
SOFTBALL 
</P>
<P>
Keene State 6-0, Cal Lutheran 4-6 -- DeeAndra Pilkington tossed a three-hit 
shutout to give host Cal Lutheran a split in a nonleague doubleheader. 
Pilkington also had four hits in the two games. KIRBY LEE

KENNEDY TAKES ADVANTAGE OF SAN FERNANDO'S CHARITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coach Steve Marden promised his San Fernando High baseball team that he 
wouldn't raise his voice this season when a game was in progress. 
</P>
<P>
Throw away the ball? Not a peep. Boot a grounder? Mouth zipped tight. Wild 
pitch to the backstop? Marden's teeth gnash, but there are no screams. 
</P>
<P>
"No yelling this year," he said. "Intensity in a game has to come from the 
team, not the coach." 
</P>
<P>
If San Fernando continues to play as it did in an 8-4 loss in a North Valley 
League opener at home against Kennedy on Thursday, Marden is destined for 
ulcers. The Tigers (3-1-1, 0-1 in league play) committed six errors in the 
game, which was called after five innings because of darkness. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando scored two runs in the first off right-hander Cody Beaumaster 
(2-0), who gave up four consecutive singles. Kennedy, however, blew the game 
open with five runs in the fourth -- or perhaps San Fernando deserves the 
credit, whichever is preferred. 
</P>
<P>
With Kennedy trailing, 2-1, Palmer Drain roped a one-out triple to right-center 
and scored on a wild pitch by Hector De La Cruz (1-1). Ben Guzman followed with 
a bunt single. 
</P>
<P>
Guzman was picked off first, but De La Cruz threw the ball away for an error. 
Jack Moussa walked and was also caught off first by De La Cruz, but first 
baseman Adrian Diaz threw the ball into left field. 
</P>
<P>
With two out, James Bernas was safe on third baseman Richard Sanchez's throwing 
error. Before the mess was sorted out -- Jason Rosen and Garret Anderson 
contributed run-scoring singles -- Kennedy (4-0, 1-0) had a 6-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy took advantage of further San Fernando charity in the fifth. Carlos 
Rodriguez, who had just moved from right field to third, booted the first ball 
hit to him, then threw it into the Kennedy dugout for a double error. 
</P>
<P>
Beaumaster allowed eight hits, struck out five and walked three in five 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
Now, how would Marden address his players? With a dressing-down? 
</P>
<P>
"I still won't yell," he said. "I'll just let them know we didn't deserve to 
win."

EL CAMINO REAL PROVES RANKING WELL DESERVED

<TEXT>
<P>
When one ponders El Camino Real High's 18-1 dismantling of host Taft in a West 
Valley League opener Thursday, several things leap to the fore. 
</P>
<P>
There was the razor-sharp pitching of senior right-hander Patrick Treend (1-0), 
who scattered just three hits -- two of them infield singles -- and allowed no 
earned runs in going the distance. 
</P>
<P>
There were the pyrotechnics provided by senior first baseman Ryan McGuire and 
senior catcher Bobby Kim, each of whom rapped out three hits, a home run and 
drove in four runs. 
</P>
<P>
And there was sparkling defense, as El Camino Real third baseman Greg Lederman 
showed range and arm strength, McGuire dropped into the splits digging out 
throws and right fielder Chris Castillo sprawled across the outfield grass to 
make a diving catch. 
</P>
<P>
In sum, a solid all-around performance. 
</P>
<P>
"We did play awfully well today," McGuire conceded. "We'd be hard-pressed to 
play this well all year." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't bad for an opener, though. 
</P>
<P>
But these guys aren't robots. In fact, they could be heard 'fessing up to 
having pregame nerves. After all, the unanimous pick for No. 1 in the Valley, 
the Conquistadores had yet to play a game. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, actually, I was really nervous," Treend said. "Coming in here 0-0, most 
of us were a little worried about how it might come out." 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry. After McGuire and Jason Cohen knocked in runs in the top of the 
first for a 2-0 lead, El Camino Real scored four more in the third on a two-run 
McGuire homer to right and a single by Kim that chased loser Cory Jacobson. 
</P>
<P>
Seven more runs followed in the fourth as 12 Conquistadores batted and the roof 
caved in for Taft (3-1, 0-1). 
</P>
<P>
For El Camino Real, center-fielder Jeff Marks had three hits, including a 
double, and drove in two runs. 
</P>
<P>
Treend struck out seven and walked just one.

EL CAMINO'S NEW COACH SEES TEAM AS COMPETITIVE

<TEXT>
<P>
After compiling a 153-97 record in six years as El Camino's head baseball 
coach, Tom Hicks is taking a season off for personal reasons. Glen LeVier, a 
former assistant at Long Beach City College, has taken over the coaching job 
from Hicks, who is still teaching full time. 
</P>
<P>
LeVier, 32, was an assistant coach for two years at Cal State Los Angeles 
before going to Long Beach in 1988. Before that he was head coach at St. 
Anthony High (1984 to 1987), where he compiled a 61-27 record and led all his 
teams to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Post-season action will be tougher to get at El Camino, however. The Warriors, 
though rich with sophomores, are inconsistent in all areas. Only two starters 
return from last year's team, which placed third in the five-member South Coast 
Conference with an 8-12 mark (27-18 overall). 
</P>
<P>
"The sophomores give us good experience," LeVier said, "but we need to play 
catch-up on defense. We're making a lot of unnecessary errors." 
</P>
<P>
Pitching is the team's biggest strength, LeVier said, although four players are 
hitting in the mid-to-high .300s. 
</P>
<P>
Three sophomores anchor the starting rotation. The Warriors' top man on the 
mound is Jon Newville (Bishop Montgomery). The other two, Jason Butcher (South 
Torrance) and Greg Davis (North Torrance), were key relievers last year, and 
LeVier is looking for someone to take their places in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino's infield includes the two returning starters: catcher Frank Pena and 
shortstop Denny Hocking. Power hitter Cesar Rivas (.350) starts at third. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Brian Wixom (North Torrance) and sophomore Mark Holcomb are still 
competing for the starting spot at first base. "They've both done good things 
offensively," LeVier said. "Now we're just looking for one of them to be 
consistent." 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Steve Allyn, a powerful left-handed line-drive hitter, starts at 
right field and sophomore John Otte in center field. Left field is a toss-up 
between freshman Howie Kingsmill (Torrance High) and sophomore Gil McDonough. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect (defending state champion) Cerritos to win the league," LeVier said, 
"but I expect to be in the playoffs. We're capable of competing with any team 
in this conference." 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors opened league play against Long Beach on March 1. So far, they are 
0-2 in the SCC and 7-7 overall.

Bishop Montgomery High School gave up two home runs and seven runs in the first 
two innings and never recovered, dropping an 11-5 decision to Northview on 
Thursday in the semifinals of the Glendora High Baseball Tournament at 
Henderson Field. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights (1-1-2) will play Glendora High for third place on Saturday at 3:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Montgomery Coach Bob Anderson sounded more like a football analyst than 
a baseball coach when describing the first two innings, in which Northview 
pounded out seven hits and scored seven runs. 
</P>
<P>
"Two mistake pitches and boom, you're down 7-0," Anderson said after Northview 
broke open the game early with the two homers. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, if you get the ball up at this place, it's going to be out. It is 
such a short porch." 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings (3-0) took a 4-0 lead in the first inning on a grand-slam home run 
by Jeff Eckler, who was 2-for-2 with five RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
In the second inning, Steve Mikesell put Northview up 7-0 with a three-run home 
run. Mikesell was 2-for-4 at the plate with three RBIs and two runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
Both of Northview's home runs were hit off Bishop Montgomery starter Mario 
Juarez, who lasted just 1 1/3 innings. He gave up five hits and five runs, all 
earned. 
</P>
<P>
Juarez was relieved by Tim Newville, who threw 2 1/3 innings and gave up eight 
hits and four runs (three earned). Joe O'Brien completed the remaining 1 1/3 
innings of the game, which was called after five innings because of a two-hour 
time limit. 
</P>
<P>
Three Northview pitchers -- Chach Aguilar, Darren Murphy and Carlos Hernandez 
-- held the Knights to five runs (four earned) on four hits and struck out 
eight. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Montgomery's only extra-base hit was a double by Abab Cabrera in the 
fourth inning, when the Knights scored four runs.

2:30 p.m. today and 1 p.m. Saturday against the Gauchos. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions, who haven't played since Saturday, have won three games in a row and 
seven of their last nine. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions are hitting .306. Outfielder Rick Mediavilla tops the regulars at

Bradbury is the top run producer with 18 RBIs; Tony Kounas and Joe Ciccarella 
lead in home runs with three each. 
</P>
<P>
Left-hander Jon Willard leads the pitching staff with a 4-1 record and 21 
strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
The Loyola volleyball team, winner of three of its last five matches, plays 
host to George Mason University at 7:30 p.m. Saturday. The Lions, 4-7, lost to 
USC in five games Wednesday. They rallied to win the fourth game and held a 
16-15 lead in the final game before falling, 17-16. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola outside hitter Sio Saipaia set a school record with 36 kills, Chuck 
Donlon added 25 kills, with a .432 hitting percentage, and Chris Young had 26 
kills on 38% hitting. Setter Rick McLaughlin recorded 95 assists.

LITHUANIANS WILL DECLARE FREEDOM FROM SOVIET UNION;

<P>
The Lithuanian nationalist movement Sajudis, whose candidates swept recent 
elections there, announced plans Thursday to declare Lithuania independent from 
the Soviet Union this weekend and then form a government. 
</P>
<P>
Vytautas Landsbergis, the Sajudis chairman, said that the movement's deputies 
in the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet, the Parliament of the Soviet Baltic republic, 
will adopt a resolution re-establishing Lithuania as an independent state at 
the Parliament's opening session Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"The struggle for autonomy and independence is reaching its culmination," 
Landsbergis told the Sajudis' governing council at a daylong meeting in 
Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital. "We cannot delay what we have to do, we cannot 
put it off." 
</P>
<P>
The resolution, as drafted, declares the "re-establishment" of Lithuanian 
independence on the basis of the republic's original declaration of 
independence from czarist Russia in 1918, a treaty with the Soviet Union signed 
in 1920 as the basis of relations between them and the constitution in effect 
when it was forcefully absorbed into the Soviet Union in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not secession, but the re-establishment of our normal legal status by 
parliamentary means," Landsbergis asserted. "The state we had before 1940 still 
exists -- it has just been frozen. 
</P>
<P>
"The 1918 declaration will be the basis of our new independence and the 
restoration of the sovereign powers of the Lithuanian state. The Supreme Soviet 
will seek the full embodiment of these sovereign powers." 
</P>
<P>
With two-thirds of the 123 seats in the Parliament, Sajudis has more than 
enough votes in the Parliament to adopt the declaration, and the Lithuanian 
Communist Party, which has declared its independence from the parent Soviet 
party, has indicated that it will not oppose the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Landsbergis' assertion that Lithuania will be recovering its 
independence rather than seceding from the Soviet Union, the planned action 
will undoubtedly provoke a major constitutional and political crisis in Moscow, 
raising questions both about the viability of the Soviet Union as a federal 
state and about President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's own authority as its leader. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the determination of Lithuanians to break away has become so strong and so 
apparent over the last year and a half that the inevitability of the move has 
been accepted by most in Moscow. The strongest opposition has come from the 20% 
of the republic's 3.6 million people who are not Lithuanian but Russian, 
Ukrainian and Polish. 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian Supreme Soviet's session was brought forward several days so 
that its action would be completed before the Congress of People's Deputies 
meets in Moscow on Monday to debate amendments to the Soviet constitution 
creating a powerful executive presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuanians are afraid that Gorbachev, who is certain to be elected to the new 
post early next week, will use his expanded authority to suspend the 
governments of the country's constituent republics in order to prevent the 
republics' break away. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has opposed Lithuanian independence. He campaigned hard in the 
republic in January for it to remain with economic independence and greater 
political autonomy within the Soviet Union, which itself is in the midst of 
far-reaching changes, including moves to create a true federal system. 
</P>
<P>
But Gorbachev, who long ago forswore the use of force in resolving the Soviet 
Union's political problems, appeared to recognize the virtual inevitability of 
the Lithuanian move and called for the drafting of legislation on procedures 
for a constituent republic's withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, Gorbachev told Algirdas Brazauskas, the Lithuanian 
president and first secretary of the Lithuanian Communist Party, that Moscow 
would want repayment of the equivalent of $34 billion in investments in 
Lithuania and other debts that it contends the republic owes as the price for 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
Also, trade between Lithuania and the Soviet Union, which now supplies raw 
materials, oil and gas in return for meat, dairy products and electronic 
components, would have to be conducted in freely convertible currencies, rather 
than Soviet rubles, Gorbachev said, and that would amount to about $13 billion 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big sum, one-third of our national product, and it is very difficult 
to know how we could settle this initially in hard currency," Brazauskas 
commented later. "I am not saying this to frighten people. I must say these 
things because they were said to me in Moscow. It would be dishonest if I did 
not tell my people." 
</P>
<P>
The speed at which Sajudis is moving drew some objections Thursday from council 
members who thought the action precipitous. 
</P>
<P>
"Slow down -- don't go too fast," said Kazimieras Antanavicius, one of the 
members. "We are in a boat that is falling apart, but we should not jump ship 
unless it is sinking. Have we really come to the point where we must jump? 
</P>
<P>
"Independence is not just a declaration -- it has to be built. Who is going to 
manage Lithuania's economy after all this? The legal system will have to be 
reorganized. We have to change our ways of thinking. I believe the Communists 
should be given the government because they have the experience to run it. 
</P>
<P>
"Independence -- the Lithuanian people want it, without a doubt they do. But do 
they want it the day after tomorrow? Can anyone say without a doubt that they 
want it that soon?" 
</P>
<P>
But another Sajudis council member, Zigmas Vasvila, voicing the majority's 
view, countered: "We need to have a political declaration. We are hanging in 
mid-air now, we are suspended in sort of a twilight." 
</P>
<P>
Landsbergis noted that the old Lithuanian republic, independent only for 22 
years, is still recognized by a number of Western countries, including the 
United States, and this makes it important to reassert Lithuanian sovereignty 
on the basis of its previous constitution. 
</P>
<P>
"The Republic of Lithuania still has diplomatic recognition in the West," 
Landsbergis said. "The function of the (republic's) Supreme Soviet is to 
continue this representation and to establish a real government in Lithuania." 
</P>
<P>
The new deputies will gather Saturday night to deal with procedural matters so 
that they can act swiftly Sunday on the declaration itself, which has been 
drafted and redrafted in a series of meetings in Vilnius this week. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies must also, under the present Lithuanian constitution, elect a 
chairman who will also serve as president of the republic, and Landsbergis is 
the most likely Sajudis nominee. 
</P>
<P>
Sajudis deputies will then proceed with legislation suspending Soviet laws on 
its territory, reenacting the 1938 Lithuanian constitution as the basic law for 
the republic and banning the conscription of Lithuanian youths by the Soviet 
armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
The movement will then attempt to form a government, though some Sajudis 
members think that the republic's economy is in such a poor state that this 
should be left to the Communist Party so that Sajudis will not be blamed for 
the resulting problems. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be wrong for Sajudis to remain in opposition and wait for a better 
moment," Landsbergis countered, reminding the movement's governing council -- 
which was meeting in the chambers of the Presidium of the Lithuanian Parliament 
-- that voters had given Sajudis a mandate for change. "We should take power 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Sajudis has also prepared a number of its own laws, many of which will seek to 
shift the present state-run economy into one where private enterprise and 
market forces will play a growing role. 
</P>
<P>
Sajudis plans to organize a massive rally outside the parliamentary chambers in 
Vilnius on Sunday in a show of popular support for the independence move.

SONS NAMED IN DOUBLE SLAYING IN BEVERLY HILLS; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: ONE ARRESTED. ENTERTAINMENT CHIEF MENENDEZ AND WIFE WERE INITIALLY 
THOUGHT VICTIMS OF A GANGLAND HIT. 
</P>

<P>
The eldest son of slain entertainment executive Jose Menendez and his wife was 
arrested Thursday on suspicion of murdering his parents last August in their 
Beverly Hills mansion. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's younger son was being sought in Israel, where he has been playing 
in an international tennis tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The gruesome shotgun murders shocked the Hollywood community and initially 
touched off widespread law enforcement speculation about a possible organized 
crime hit. 
</P>
<P>
But from the outset, Beverly Hills detectives said Thursday, they suspected the 
Menendez sons, Lyle, 22, and Erik, 19, who stood to share exclusively in an 
estate valued at $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
Lyle, who had been under police surveillance, was taken into custody Thursday 
afternoon as he left the family home on Elm Drive, and was booked at the West 
Hollywood sheriff's station. The district attorney could ask for 
special-circumstances allegations that make him eligible for the death penalty 
if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
A murder complaint has also been issued for Erik, a professional tennis player 
who has been competing in a tournament in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills police said they believe they have a strong case against the two 
sons. 
</P>
<P>
"We're on real solid, solid ground," Lt. Russ Olson, the Beverly Hills chief of 
detectives, said after the arrest. But he would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in this business for over 33 years and I have heard of very few 
murders that were more savage than this one was," Beverly Hills Police Chief 
Marvin D. Iannone told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
As for the motive, Iannone said it was not determined if "there was a sole 
motive or several motives." 
</P>
<P>
He noted, however, that it was "no big secret that the Menendezes had an estate 
that was worth millions of dollars" and that the two brothers were the sole 
beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
Iannone said 'there were all kinds of theories" about the murders which led to 
the gathering of "a lot of evidence," much of it "very circumstantial." 
</P>
<P>
But "just recently," he said, detectives found "the glue, if you will, to bind 
(the case) together. . . . And I feel we have a very tight case." 
</P>
<P>
He would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
It was revealed on Thursday that police had served search warrants to seize the 
records of a psychologist who had seen the entire Menendez family. Sandi 
Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office, said the arrest was 
"based on newly discovered evidence and did involve some conversations." 
Reliable sources said those conversations were with the psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
Lyle Menendez's lawyer, Gerald Chaleff, was sharply critical of Beverly Hills 
police and the prosecutor for seizing the psychologist's records. "It is very 
troublesome," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Suggesting that state law could have been violated, he said he was "astounded 
that the district attorney's office would violate the psychotherapist-patient 
privilege." 
</P>
<P>
Chaleff declined to comment on any other aspects of the case until he had a 
chance to study the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
The Menendez brothers are tall, handsome, athletic competitors whose easy 
self-assurance seemed to mark them for success. Lyle, in particular, was 
regarded as intimidating, with a deep self-confidence that bordered on 
arrogance. Friends and relatives described both brothers as articulate young 
men who seemed sure of their futures, even in the wake of the tragic deaths of 
their parents. 
</P>
<P>
Their father, Jose, 45, chief executive of Live Entertainment Inc. of Van Nuys, 
a video and music distributor, and his wife, Kitty, 44, were killed instantly 
by more than a dozen close-range blasts from two 12-gauge shotguns as they were 
watching television in the first-floor library of their home about 10 p.m. last 
Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
There was no sign of forced entry into the home. Nor was there any indication 
of a robbery, and no murder weapons were found. 
</P>
<P>
The Menendez sons reported finding their parents' bodies when they returned 
from a night out. 
</P>
<P>
"From the very onset we had suspicions of the boys' involvement," Olson said in 
a telephone interview. "As more evidence developed, it pointed only in one 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
Olson and his two lead detectives believe that Lyle Menendez orchestrated the 
murders and that Erik could have been intimidated into going along. "Lyle was 
the heavyweight in this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Menendez, in the event of his and his wife's simultaneous death, left his 
entire $14-million estate to the two children. After estate taxes and other 
items were subtracted, Lyle and Erik stood to net $3 million each. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, a $400,000 personal life insurance policy on Jose Menendez 
already has been distributed to Lyle and Erik. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Beverly Hills detectives appeared to focus much of their 
investigation on the possibility that the slayings were the result of a dispute 
with characters having organized crime connections. 
</P>
<P>
That was because Menendez's company, Live Entertainment Inc., had links to the 
pornography video business before it was acquired by Carolco Pictures Inc., a 
studio that produced the Rambo films. 
</P>
<P>
Another area of organized crime interest had been Live Entertainment's 
acquisition early last year of a New England-based retail record chain once 
controlled by a reputed New York crime family boss. 
</P>
<P>
But as the investigation unfolded, detectives increasingly focused their 
efforts on the two brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Both Lyle and Erik had told police that they had spent that Sunday evening 
seeing the film "Batman" in Century City and that they had later attended a 
wine and food festival at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium. Still later, they 
said, they were to meet a friend at a Beverly Hills restaurant, the Cheesecake 
Factory. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives began digging into their alibi and, according to an affidavit in 
support of a search warrant, examined outgoing calls from pay telephones at the 
auditorium. The brothers maintained they had made calls to a friend from the 
auditorium, telling him to meet them at the Beverly Hills restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Police did not disclose whether they found any flaws in the brothers' account 
of the evening. According to one knowledgeable source, however, police 
investigators were skeptical of the brothers' claim that they had seen "Batman" 
in Century City. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives also discovered that a reference to a will was deleted from the 
family's home computer after the murders. They believe that the will, whether 
old or new, was intentionally destroyed by Lyle, according to several sources 
familiar with the police investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives told The Times that in recent years Menendez was discussing changing 
his will to take into account his rapidly growing wealth. But relatives said 
there was no evidence that such a will was ever written. 
</P>
<P>
What is known, according to several sources, was that there was a reference to 
a will in the computer located in the upstairs bedroom of the Menendez home. 
The reference to the will was contained in a file name on a computer disk. 
Shortly after the slayings, a member of the Menendez family discovered the 
reference and attempted to view the file, these sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Before an expert could be called in to reconstruct whatever might have been in 
the computer, the file was deleted from the disk in such a way that it could 
not be recovered by police experts. 
</P>
<P>
Olson said the deletion of the information in the computer was important to the 
case. "The computer was a key factor for a motive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Olson also said there were new developments in the last few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"There were some witnesses we were able to develop. There was some physical 
evidence within the last couple of weeks and last couple of days." 
</P>
<P>
After gunning down the Menendez couple, the killers -- there were two, 
according to law enforcement sources -- picked up the shotgun shell casings 
from the library's inlaid wood floor and walked out into the night. Robbery was 
not considered a motive. Nothing of value was missing from the home. 
</P>
<P>
Olson said the crime had clearly been carefully planned. 
</P>
<P>
"There definitely was planning," he said. "How long it was in the planning, I'm 
not sure." 
</P>
<P>
Although his family had once been influential and wealthy in their native Cuba, 
Jose Menendez had virtually nothing when his parents sent him out of the 
country 30 years ago after Fidel Castro came to power. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing his education in the United States, Menendez worked his way through 
Queens College in New York and obtained an accounting degree. 
</P>
<P>
He married Mary Louise (Kitty) Andersen, an athletic, outgoing woman who had 
been a beauty queen in her hometown of Oak Lawn, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Menendez's rise in business began when he audited a Chicago company and so 
impressed the firm's officials that they hired him and made him president of 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
From there, he held executive positions at Hertz and RCA before coming to 
California in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you will ever find a person that will ever say anything about 
Jose that wasn't to the effect that he was just extraordinary," Lyle said last 
year in an interview with The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Lyle and Erik characterized him as a devoted father who never missed a soccer 
game in which his sons played. But he also was a perfectionist, never satisfied 
with his own success. "He really couldn't do something well enough," Lyle said. 
</P>
<P>
The father's drive to succeed rubbed off on the sons. "You become very 
demanding," Lyle said, though he added that "it was sometimes difficult for 
Erik and I." 
</P>
<P>
"It's extremely hard to believe anything like this could happen -- that the 
boys were the ones who killed their parents," said Carlos Baralt, an uncle who 
is the executor of the family estate. 
</P>
<P>
"It really is unbelieveable," he said. "For some time the whole family was 
seeing a psychologist; the parents and the boys were."

UCLA PLANS TO INCREASE ITS FACILITIES BY A THIRD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA, looking to maintain its standing among major research and teaching 
universities, unveiled an ambitious, long-range development plan Thursday that 
would increase its total physical plant -- including classrooms, residential 
space, offices and medical facilities -- by one third over the next 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, announced by UCLA Chancellor Charles Young, involves a major foray 
into university-owned land on the southwest end of Westwood Village. It 
includes a residential village for 2,700 graduate students and faculty and a 
much-disputed conference center on what is known as Lot 32, a finger of land 
that reaches down from the main campus and abuts Wilshire Boulevard, west of 
Gayley Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"UCLA has risen quickly to the ranks of the world's premier research 
universities," Young said. The proposed expansion will enable it to "continue 
that ascent and remain a valuable asset to the community" while acquiring the 
staff and technology necessary "for us to make a contribution which is needed 
in the 21st Century." 
</P>
<P>
Despite assurances from Young that the plans would not adversely affect the 
area, the announcement immediately raised concerns in the community about 
traffic congestion and livability in one of Los Angeles' most crowded and 
popular areas. 
</P>
<P>
"The amount and the intensity of the plan may be more than the area can 
handle," said Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, a UCLA graduate 
whose district includes Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
Young insisted, however, that the university's goals can be achieved without 
increasing traffic. "We're prepared not only to state that can be done, but we 
are prepared to live with the restriction" that there be no increase in 
traffic, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
The blueprint -- essentially a land-use plan -- also envisions building a new 
600-patient hospital, with the existing Medical Center converted into offices 
and auxiliary health services, including research space. 
</P>
<P>
No dollar figure has been placed on the facilities, as each one must be 
approved and funded separately over the years. The total, Young said, would be 
"a lot. It's more than I'd like to go out and raise immediately." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed UCLA construction must compete for limited state education funds. 
The UC system is also pushing an ambitious plan to build three new campuses 
that could drain away resources. Despite the planned building boom that could 
add 4.45 million square feet to the current 13.3 million square feet of 
facilities, Young denied that it is a plan for growth. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not an expansion plan," Young said at a news conference on campus. "UCLA 
is not in an expansion mode." 
</P>
<P>
Only a minor increase in the student population is anticipated, he said. The 
student body is expected to grow by about 1,500 from its 34,674 students now. 
Faculty and staff population is expected to rise by about 4,000 in the next 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Young said the proposals are a necessity in UCLA's mission to continue to 
attract top faculty and students by providing state-of-the art research 
facilities and an intellectual milieu that fosters excellence. Faculty and 
students are now squeezed into space that has long been inadequate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Community leaders, many of whom are among the Westside's slow-growth activists, 
are not convinced that such major development would leave Westwood Village and 
its neighbors untouched. Representatives of two homeowners' groups called 
Young's assurances "ludicrous" and "a bad joke." 
</P>
<P>
While applauding UCLA's goal of retaining its standing as a preeminent 
university, Yaroslavsky said the goal must be accomplished in a "way that does 
not undermine the quality of life of their neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said he is not convinced by Young's contentions that the plan would 
not detract from the area. 
</P>
<P>
"I think UCLA clearly has to be poised for some skepticism on the part of the 
city and the community," he said. "It is impossible that 4 million square feet 
of building is not going to generate traffic. It's hard to fathom." 
</P>
<P>
According to a 1987 city transportation study, Wilshire Boulevard and Veteran 
Avenue just east of the San Diego Freeway was the busiest intersection in Los 
Angeles with 126,000 cars passing each day. Ed Rowe, general manager of the 
city's Department of Transportation, estimated that the figure has grown 
between 5% and 10% since then, with no end in sight. 
</P>
<P>
In its promise not to add to this glut of cars, Young said the university will 
gear up its already successful programs of car- and van-pooling. In addition, 
the residential village, which was suggested to the school by community groups, 
will reduce traffic because people who now commute to the campus will be able 
to walk. 
</P>
<P>
Young also noted that the long-range plan does not provide any new parking 
spaces because "construction of parking places will generate more trips." 
However, 3,000 already-approved parking spaces will be constructed; and where 
parking lots are used for construction sites, those spaces will be replaced 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging the university's claim of no added traffic was a "wild 
card" that would be met with skepticism, Rowe said if such a feat is 
accomplished anywhere in town, it will be at UCLA. "They have a model program 
over there and an obvious commitment on the part of UCLA administration," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Two community leaders, however, took a different view. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a massive amount of development, no matter how you look at it, in an area 
that is already massively impacted," said Sandy Brown, vice president of 
Westwood-Holmby Property Owners Assn. "To say that amount of development isn't 
going to be noticeable in terms of impact is ludicrous." 
</P>
<P>
Laura Lake, president of Friends of Westwood, rejected Young's contention that 
the long-range plan could be accomplished without adversely affecting the 
community. "This idea of not producing traffic is a bad joke," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowner groups are particularly concerned about the proposed Conference 
Center, which would include up to 300 rooms for overnight guests attending 
programs at the university. "I call it a hotel," Brown said. "UCLA doesn't need 
to be in the hotel business, to derive money from someone sleeping overnight in 
a facility they provide." 
</P>
<P>
Young said the proposed Conference Center would not generate as much traffic as 
a commercial hotel and would not cause the same impact to the community. 
</P>
<P>
The word "hotel" is particularly sensitive in Westwood. The most contentious 
issue in a hard-fought community plan that went into effect in January, 1989, 
was whether the Village should have a new hotel, and if so, how big. One hotel 
was approved for the Village proper, but UCLA's facility is just outside the 
perimeter and it is not bound by the plan in any event. 
</P>
<P>
A public hearing on the draft long-range development plan and its environmental 
impact report is scheduled for April 4 at 7 p.m. at the Tennis Center on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
The long-range development plan contains a commitment to preserve the "campus 
in a garden" environment by protecting existing areas of open space and 
creating plazas, courts, gardens and walkways in future developments on the 
419-acre campus. 
</P>
<P>
Among the new academic facilities proposed are an expansion of the law library, 
which is already partially funded, an expansion of the Graduate School of 
Architecture and Urban Planning, and new research space for the humanities and 
life sciences programs. 
</P>
<P>
A significant expansion of the existing studio, rehearsal and performance 
facilities is proposed for the fine arts department, while obsolete engineering 
facilities are slated for replacement. A 200,000-square-foot research library 
is also on the university's wish list, as is state-of-the art research labs for 
molecular biology and the physical sciences. An expanded child-care center is 
also on the drawing boards. 
</P>
<P>
Young said there are substantial financial obstacles that must be overcome 
before the UCLA Medical Center can build a new facility for its patients. He 
predicted that it will be the end of the decade before the facility is built. 
No specific site is designated for the hospital, but Young said it will be near 
the existing Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The new facility would replace outdated hospital rooms that were built before 
major technological advancements. Remodeling them would ultimately be more 
costly than starting anew, he said. 
</P>

INTEREST RATES PERIL FED CHIEF'S JOB, SOURCES SAY 
</P>

President Bush is so upset over Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan's 
refusal to push interest rates down further that he is unlikely to reappoint 
him as Fed chairman when his term expires in August of 1991, sources said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Although White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater denied it, a longtime 
Bush adviser said the President was "mad as hell" about Greenspan's position. 
The source implied that he would seek a new Fed chief when Greenspan's current 
term is over. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe he will reappoint him and I don't know a soul in the White 
House who thinks he will," said the adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said the matter of Greenspan's reappointment had not been discussed 
in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
The sources, who asked not to be identified, offered a different interpretation 
of Bush's feelings. And they said that, although Greenspan's future may not 
have been discussed in any formal way, the prevailing White House sentiment 
made his reappointment improbable unless Fed policy in the next 17 months moves 
in the direction the White House prefers. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past few months, Administration officials have criticized the Fed on 
several occasions for keeping interest rates too high. But this is the first 
time that anyone close to Bush has suggested that the President is so agitated 
over the issue that Greenspan's reappointment is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater acknowledged in an interview that Bush differed with Greenspan's 
tight money policy. When told that sources had said Bush was so upset with 
Greenspan that he would probably not reappoint him as chairman, Fitzwater said: 
"I don't think he's nearly that upset. Let me check and call you back in five 
minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater called back and said he had checked with White House Chief of Staff 
John H. Sununu and Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic 
Advisers. 
</P>
<P>
"They say the President has the highest respect for Greenspan and likes him and 
has worked with him closely over the years and has included him in meetings," 
he said. "And it's just not the case there's any anger. Reappointment hasn't 
been discussed and he's not up for a year and a half." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said he had never seen Bush express any anger over Greenspan's 
policy. "The only one I've seen angry," he said, is Budget Director Richard G. 
Darman. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, Darman said in a television interview that if the country fell 
into a recession, it would be because the central bank "erred on the side of 
caution. " 
</P>
<P>
Darman subsequently explained that he had not meant to be so blunt, and he has 
not spoken out publicly since. Although a top OMB official said he had heard no 
discussion of Greenspan's future, Darman is known to feel strongly about the 
issue and has continued to discuss it in Administration circles. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan could not be reached Thursday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Republican sources say many economists think Greenspan's monetary policy has 
been too tight in the face of recent weaknesses in the economy and agree that 
his differences with the Administration mean he is unlikely to be reappointed. 
</P>
<P>
These economists, a former high-level Republican official said, think Greenspan 
"is too academic and too theoretical about zero-based inflation for the real 
world." This view holds that Greenspan should have been lowering interest rates 
in the face of "durable goods (orders) dropping and other economic statistics 
not looking good." 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan told Congress just two weeks ago that the economy has probably passed 
the point where recession is a serious threat. With the danger of recession 
fading, the Fed chairman indicated that he was unlikely to encourage interest 
rates to fall because of the risk that the move might push inflation higher. 
</P>
<P>
And on Jan. 30, Greenspan dismissed lawmakers' suggestions that there might be 
a rift between him and the Administration. A week and a half earlier, Fitzwater 
had asserted that a further easing of interest rates would be justified. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the Bush team's repeated criticism of the Fed has served to 
unsettle financial markets, which apparently want the Fed to continue keeping a 
tight grip on the monetary reins to help guard against a further speedup in 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed began last June to reduce interest rates gradually. But when it moved 
in December to ease credit another notch, the central bank ran into a backlash 
in the financial markets. Investors interpreted the step as a signal that 
Greenspan was going too far in abandoning the fight against inflation. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the market reaction, the central bank quickly halted any further 
moves toward lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The flap between Bush and Greenspan is by no means the first time that 
administrations and the Federal Reserve have been at odds over interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
President Ronald Reagan's first Treasury Secretary, Donald T. Regan, never 
forgave Greenspan's predecessor, Paul A. Volcker, for following tight money 
policies that Regan blamed for the 1981-82 recession. Under pressure from Wall 
Street, Reagan reappointed Volcker to another term as Fed chairman in 1983. But 
when Regan became his chief of staff, Reagan replaced Volcker with Greenspan in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Volcker was also in trouble with Democratic President Jimmy Carter, who was 
forced to appoint him in the first place in 1979 after Carter's own economic 
policies failed and inflation soared to more than 12%. 
</P>
<P>
And in the early 1970s, the late Fed Chairman Arthur F. Burns clashed with the 
White House of Richard M. Nixon, even though he had been a top Nixon economic 
adviser before joining the Fed. 
</P>
<P>
As in the case of Volcker and Burns, however, Greenspan is popular with 
Congress, which seems pleased with his performance. Senate Banking Committee 
Chairman Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) told Greenspan recently: "The job is in 
the best possible hands." 
</P>
<P>
Once the top economic adviser to former President Gerald R. Ford, Greenspan, 
64, is a mainstream Republican who is known as a conservative and well-informed 
economist and essentially a team player. 
</P>
<P>
Though technically a creature of Congress, the Fed's seven-member board of 
governors is almost entirely independent of any other part of government, 
precisely so that it can serve as a counterbalance to the Administration and 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan took office as Fed chairman on Aug. 11, 1987. His term as chairman 
expires in August, 1991, but he is entitled to remain on the board as an 
ordinary governor until Jan. 31, 1992.

A doctor who was suing the city, charging that she had contracted AIDS through 
the carelessness of another physician, accepted a settlement Thursday as 
attorneys were preparing to present their trial summations. 
</P>
<P>
The judge would say only that the amount was "between zero and $100 million." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Veronica Prego said she was happy that the trial had ended. "It's been 
extremely difficult for me," she said, adding that the strain of the two-month 
trial had caused her condition to worsen. "Now it's time to take care of 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
Judge Aaron D. Bernstein ordered the lawyers on both sides not to disclose the 
amount of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no one's business, except the people who are paying it and the person 
who's receiving it," Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, none of the parties named in the lawsuit acknowledged any 
guilt. 
</P>
<P>
Prego maintained in her $175-million lawsuit, which named the city Health and 
Hospitals Corp. and two physicians, that she had contracted the deadly acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome when a doctor who had drawn blood from an AIDS 
patient in 1983 left the contaminated needle and other debris on the patient's 
bedding. Prego said she accidentally pricked her finger when cleaning up the 
waste. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Wilner, a lawyer for the 32-year-old Prego, said the settlement was 
accepted because defense lawyers said they would appeal any jury award. An 
appeal would tie the matter up in the courts for two to three years. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Prego must live the rest of her life with some peace and must be able to 
put this behind her," Wilner said. "In essence, I believe they put a gun to our 
head with the appeal." 
</P>
<P>
Health and Hospitals Corp. lawyer Stanley D. Friedman said of the settlement: 
"We're most pleased. I can't tell you the numbers, but we're most pleased."

KEY INFANT MORTALITY FACTOR RISES AFTER 10-YEAR DECLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The incidence of low birth weight among U.S. newborns, considered a critical 
indicator of infant mortality, is increasing after a 10-year decline, 
particularly among black babies, federal health officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
CDC officials attributed the trend to fewer women receiving early prenatal care 
and said there could be an association with crack cocaine use. 
</P>
<P>
"Studies have shown that cocaine is a risk factor for low birth weight, and 
there has certainly been an increase in illicit drug use," said Carol J. R. 
Hogue, director of the reproductive health division of the Centers for Disease 
Control. 
</P>
<P>
The incidence of babies born weighing less than 5 1/2 pounds increased 2.2% 
between 1985 and 1987 after declining 9% from 1975 to 1985, according to the 
Centers for Disease Control. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the latest year for which figures are available, 69 of every 1,000 
live newborns weighed less than 5 1/2 pounds, compared with 67.5 in 1985 and 
73.9 a decade earlier, CDC reported. 
</P>
<P>
"The reversal of the trend is very important, since prior to this there had 
been a consistent decline," Hogue said. "A deterioration in our birth weight 
distribution means continued slippage in our international (infant mortality) 
standing, which indicates to me that we need to change what we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
The rate of newborns with "very low birth weight" of less than 3 1/4 pounds 
also rose, the agency said. In 1987, 12.4 of every 1,000 newborns were so 
classified, compared with 11.6 in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Although the overall incidence of low birth weight fell from 1975 through 1987 
for both white and black infants, the decline was much greater for white 
newborns, the agency said. In 1987, 127.1 of every 1,000 black newborns weighed 
less than 5 1/2 pounds, compared with 56.8 for whites. 
</P>
<P>
But the incidence of very low birth weight increased for both groups, rising to 
9.2 per 1,000 among white infants and 27.3 among blacks, CDC said. 
</P>
<P>
The CDC, in its report, said the data "underscore the substantial and 
persistent difference between black and white infants in the risk for low birth 
weight. Reasons for the worsening gap between the rates for black and white . . 
. infants are complex." 
</P>
<P>
Among the reasons, the agency said, are that more black women are poor, single, 
under the age of 20, undereducated or lacking proper prenatal care -- all 
considered high risk factors in bearing low birth weight babies. 
</P>

"We need to provide pre-conception counseling to reduce unintended pregnancies, 
increase healthy behaviors and assure that women, when they become pregnant, 
receive early and comprehensive prenatal care," Hogue said. 
</P>
<P>
Although very low birth weight babies are less than 2% of all births, Hogue 
said they make up a "very large proportion" of deaths during the first year of 
life. "They are much more likely to die than babies who weigh 6 pounds or 
more," she noted. 
</P>
<P>
About 93% of the very low birth weight babies are premature, she said. 
</P>
<P>
CDC's findings were based on an analysis of birth certificate data provided by 
the 50 states and the District of Columbia to CDC's National Center for Health 
Statistics, the agency said. The data included birth weight and related 
demographic and health information for the mother and infant.

MILITARY TO WIDEN DRUG FIGHT ROLE; 
</P>
<P>
NARCOTICS: CHENEY WILL UNVEIL NEW SURVEILLANCE POLICY TODAY. ARMED FORCES WILL 
STEP UP PATROLS OFF THE COASTS OF FLORIDA AND SOUTHEAST ASIA.

The U.S. military will soon take on a significantly expanded role in the war on 
drugs, stepping up patrols both close to home and off the coast of Southeast 
Asia under a package of initiatives to be unveiled today by Defense Secretary 
Dick Cheney. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney also will announce that the White House has assigned the Pentagon the 
lead responsibility to provide surveillance and serve as the intelligence and 
communications hub linking all U.S. agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Pacific Command, previously a bit player in the military's drug 
interdiction efforts, will increase its drug patrols in the waters off 
Southeast Asia. The area is the source of as much as 45% of the heroin now 
coming into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Defense officials said interdiction was a possibility but added that the 
patrols will focus more on gathering and relaying intelligence to forces closer 
to U.S. shores. 
</P>
<P>
Naval patrols in the Caribbean Sea off Florida also will be increased, and the 
Pentagon will deploy and man legions of new "eye-in-the-sky" aerostats along 
the United States' southern coast. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is slated to go into effect as soon as possible, defense officials 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Notably absent from the list of new military actions is a proposal to operate a 
U.S. naval flotilla off the coast of Colombia in search of drug runners. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the U.S. invasion of Panama, Colombian leaders balked at the 
proposal, which they typified as a "blockade." Although U.S. ships were already 
steaming toward the area, the United States quickly withdrew the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney approved the initiatives he will announce today after U.S. regional 
commanders submitted plans to increase and reorganize their roles in the 
drug-interdiction effort. Most were drawn up and sent to the Pentagon in 
October. However, final decisions were delayed because of reviews by other U.S. 
agencies and by the U.S. invasion of Panama. 
</P>
<P>
The defense secretary already has approved a measure establishing a joint task 
force that would operate surveillance and patrol along the U.S.-Mexican border 
out of Ft. Bliss, Tex. Two other joint task forces operate out of Oakland, 
Calif., and Key West, Fla., coordinating drug interdiction efforts on the West 
and East coasts, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
In the Pacific, naval forces operating out of California, Japan, the 
Philippines and Hawaii will ply the narrow straits of the South China and 
Philippines Seas in search of drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
While Pacific naval forces have long monitored drug traffic as it left 
Southeast Asia and approached U.S. territories, U.S. officials said the new 
operations would be more aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
"The intelligence they're going to receive from those operations will be more 
important," said one Administration official familiar with the plan. "The 
patrols are going to be more focused and less oriented to targets of 
opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
The stepped-up drug-interdiction efforts in the Pacific come as Soviet naval 
operations in those theaters have turned down dramatically. As Soviet ships 
have pulled out of formerly important ports, such as Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam, 
U.S. naval forces have been freed for other tasks. 
</P>
<P>
It also comes as drug production in the "Golden Triangle" of Southeast Asia is 
sharply on the rise, with Thailand as a key production, smuggling and transit 
site. Production of opium is also up significantly in Laos and Myanmar. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the aerostat-lined southern coast of the United States, Air Force 
Airborne Warning and Control Systems will operate stepped-up patrols. The AWACs 
provide the ability to monitor air traffic of key areas around Cuba, Mexico and 
as far south as Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
American officials have said that with the fall of Panamanian strongman Manuel 
A. Noriega's alleged drug empire, Cuba could increase in importance as a drug 
transit site. 
</P>
<P>
The initiatives are all part of the Pentagon's new-found enthusiasm for the 
drug interdiction mission. Defense department officials said that in drafting 
their initiatives, the armed forces were urged to consider "forward leaning" 
measures that would involve using American military power to counteract drug 
activity far from U.S. shores.

Thousands of demonstrators across Haiti set up flaming tire barricades and 
burned cars Thursday to protest the army's killing of a schoolgirl. Three 
people were killed and at least 12 hurt in clashes with soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 people shouting slogans against Haiti's leader, Lt. Gen. Prosper 
Avril, converged near the National Palace after attending a memorial service 
for 11-year-old Roseline Vaval, shot to death by the army Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Along the road leading from this capital to the town of Petit Goave, where the 
girl was buried Thursday, thousands of protesters burned a police car and other 
automobiles and built barricades of blazing tires. Radio Metropole said that 
the dead included a soldier beaten to death by the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Later, protesters leaving a memorial service in the slum neighborhood of Bel 
Air left flaming tires at crossroads along the route into this city. Soldiers 
used truncheons and fired into the air to disperse about 1,000 protesters. 
</P>
<P>
Avril, who came to power in September, 1988, in a coup led by rank-and-file 
soldiers, has been under increasing pressure from opposition groups to resign.

Mongolia's premier on Thursday held inconclusive talks on live television with 
opposition leaders and hunger strikers demanding a multi-party system, 
diplomats in Ulan Bator said. 
</P>
<P>
Premier Dumaagiyn Sodnom met with 30 to 40 representatives from five unofficial 
political groups, including several hunger strikers, but the televised debate 
broke off after 90 minutes, a source said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the hunger strikers are continuing their protest. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 members of Mongolia's infant opposition groups started the hunger 
strike Wednesday after the government failed to respond to their demands for 
reforms that were outlined in a petition delivered Sunday, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The petition, signed by the Mongolian Democratic Union and three other 
unofficial political groups, calls for the Communist Party to give up its 
monopoly on power and hold new parliamentary elections.

REBELLION: BUT HIS ATTEMPT TO OVERTHROW THE KABUL REGIME ONLY DEEPENS THE 
DISUNITY AMONG THE ISLAMIC GUERRILLAS.

<P>
Afghanistan's renegade defense minister, Shahnawaz Tanai, declared Thursday 
that "the fight is not over," but his bloody attempt to overthrow President 
Najibullah's Soviet-backed government this week has driven deeper divisions 
into the ranks of the regime's enemies, diplomats and independent analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As shops, offices and the airport reopened in the Afghan capital of Kabul, 
leaders of the Islamic guerrilla movement that has been battling the regime for 
a decade from neighboring Pakistan rejected Tanai's appeal for an alliance. 
</P>
<P>
"How can we extend our support to a Communist?" asked fundamentalist 
moujahedeen leader Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, referring to Tanai, a veteran army 
general and hard-liner who has bitterly opposed Najibullah's offer of 
negotiations with the Islamic rebels for years -- until Wednesday's apparent 
failure of his coup attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Amid independent reports that Najibullah's forces had reclaimed control of all 
major cities and installations, senior Pakistani officials also attempted to 
distance themselves from Tanai, who was forced from his stronghold by heavy 
fire and flew his family to safety in Pakistan aboard a commandeered Afghan 
military helicopter Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, Pakistani authorities confirmed that Tanai had come to 
Pakistan but, hours later, senior Foreign Ministry officials announced that he 
had gone back inside Afghanistan with the moujahedeen rebels. 
</P>
<P>
The moujahedeen's rejection of any alliance with Tanai and his remaining 
mutinous forces came soon after that announcement, leading one Afghan expert to 
comment, "Everyone lost this one." 
</P>
<P>
The Islamic state of Pakistan has staunchly supported the moujahedeen since the 
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December, 1979. It has provided refuge to 
more than 3 million Afghan refugees, harbored moujahedeen bases and 
administered a multibillion-dollar U.S.-financed arms and ammunition pipeline 
to the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, though, the government in Islamabad appeared utterly confused 
about the aftermath of the coup, which Najibullah has publicly charged was 
engineered by the Pakistani military intelligence agency, the Interservices 
Intelligence Directorate. That is the agency that has coordinated the 
moujahedeen's logistics and administered the U.S. arms pipeline since the war 
began. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the State Department also appeared to have been blindsided by 
the long-rumored coup attempt and its result, with senior officials telling a 
congressional committee and journalists that the situation remains "unclear" or 
"confused." 
</P>
<P>
When Tanai's coup began, with devastating bombing runs on Najibullah's palace 
and other key government buildings in downtown Kabul on Tuesday, both Islamabad 
and other pro-moujahedeen governments appeared to be playing the role of 
cheerleader. 
</P>
<P>
Pakistani officials and Western diplomats in Islamabad told reporters early 
Wednesday that Tanai's forces had taken over Bagram air base, 30 miles north of 
Kabul, which is the regime's largest and most strategic air force installation. 
Later they conceded that the base was, in fact, destroyed in aerial bombing 
runs ordered by Najibullah. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, they said there were unconfirmed reports that Soviet pilots had 
flown the bombing runs on Bagram. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, though, the same sources added that heavy fighting was 
reported around Kabul Airport, when, in fact, the airport was reopened Thursday 
morning to both incoming military flights and outgoing civilian aircraft, none 
of which encountered any fire. 
</P>
<P>
Radio Kabul put the death toll at 56 and said 200 people were injured in the 
fighting. It also reported that Najibullah had replaced four members of the 
Supreme Defense Council, as well as Tanai. A diplomat based in Kabul quoted the 
president as telling a news conference: "The microbes, the radicals among us, 
have been cleansed. We don't have any more factions. We are more united than 
ever." 
</P>
<P>
Dazed passengers arriving in New Delhi on Thursday night on the first civilian 
flight out of Afghanistan since the coup began confirmed that there had been no 
damage to the airport and that life in the city had returned to normal. 
</P>
<P>
In Pakistan, diplomats and senior officials declined to speculate on Tanai's 
next move. All asserted that the Soviet-trained general's whereabouts are 
unknown, although they insisted he is no longer on Pakistani soil. 
</P>
<P>
Tanai himself said he was "inside Afghanistan" in the two-minute taped message 
released by intermediaries in Islamabad on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a call for Afghanistan's Muslim people and the army and the real 
(ruling) party members," Tanai declared in a voice recognized by Western 
reporters who have met him in Kabul. "Najib(ullah) and his dictatorship will 
fall. For this and for national unity, we have risen up." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, fundamentalist moujahedeen leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar had come out 
publicly in support of Tanai's coup. Independent analysts said that was, at 
best, a tactical alliance between a hard-line Stalinist and a committed Islamic 
fundamentalist. Pakistani authorities even said Tanai spoke with Hekmatyar on 
Wednesday after he fled his rebel base. 
</P>
<P>
But, on Thursday, Sayyaf, who has sided with Hekmatyar in the past, flatly 
rejected Tanai's call for support saying, "He is no different than Najib." 
</P>
<P>
The public split between the two most fundamentalist leaders of the already 
fractious, seven-party moujahedeen alliance served only to deepen the disunity 
that has plagued the rebels in their bid to overthrow Najibullah. 
</P>
<P>
Deep divisions between the fundamentalists and moderates in the moujahedeen 
also led the failure of last year's ill-fated attempt to form a representative 
government-in-exile in Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the effect of Tanai's coup on the rebels, though, most Western 
diplomats said Thursday that Najibullah is the biggest loser. 
</P>
<P>
In crushing the coup, the Afghan leader was forced to kill veteran air force 
pilots and destroy a key air base. Military analysts said that his uncertain 
control over the air force, which participated heavily in the coup attempt, has 
left his counterinsurgency machine crippled, at best. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the only question is whether the moujahedeen can capitalize on it," 
said an Asian military analyst in New Delhi. "If not, then it is true -- 
everybody loses."

DIPLOMACY: AMERICA HAS NEVER ACKNOWLEDGED THE BALTIC STATES' INCORPORATION. BUT

The United States is preparing for a particularly awkward turn in a 50-year 
diplomatic minuet if Lithuania, as expected, declares itself independent of the 
Soviet Union this weekend, U.S. and Lithuanian officials acknowledged Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has never recognized the incorporation of Lithuania and its 
two Baltic neighbors, Estonia and Latvia, into the Soviet Union in the opening 
days of World War II. During much of the Cold War, Washington called on Moscow 
to grant freedom to the three "captive nations." 
</P>
<P>
But as that goal approaches reality in Lithuania, the United States has been 
leaning over backward to avoid offending Moscow, which could reduce Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's willingness to allow secession. Instead of 
calling for "independence" or "freedom" in the Baltics, for example, the United 
States has said it supports "self-determination." 
</P>
<P>
And now, as the new Lithuanian Parliament prepares to vote on formal 
independence, Washington has indicated it will continue to tip-toe through the 
legal and diplomatic complexities. 
</P>
<P>
In response to a question Thursday, State Department spokeswoman Margaret 
Tutwiler repeated that "the United States does not recognize the forcible 
incorporation of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania into the Soviet Union. We 
believe that all parties to these disputes should settle their differences 
peacefully." 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler warned that little more will be said in the immediate future, however, 
as the United States seeks to keep a low profile while it assesses its next 
moves, such as whether to recognize a new government in Lithuania and how to 
change the almost bizarre diplomatic relationship between Washington and 
Vilnius. 
</P>
<P>
At present, the U.S. consul general in Leningrad represents American interests 
in Lithuania and the two other Baltic states. He periodically visits their 
capitals to reassert the U.S. position that those states are not recognized as 
part of the Soviet Union. He does not call on the top government leaders who 
were imposed by Moscow lest the contacts suggest they are regarded as 
legitimate representatives of the people. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador in Moscow, for his part, never visits the Baltic capitals. 
But a former U.S. diplomat in Moscow said the U.S. ambassador can visit the 
Baltic countryside. This results in an extraordinary division of responsibility 
between U.S. diplomats "at the city limits" of those capitals, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the future, now that fair elections have been held in Lithuania, contacts 
between U.S. diplomats and Lithuania's new legislature may occur, the official 
predicted. 
</P>
<P>
"We might actually seek out those people who have been popularly elected, while 
still avoiding most of the government officials," he said. Yet he acknowledged 
that deciding which Lithuanians are legitimate representatives of the people 
would probably be more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond these peculiarities, "our main concern now is not to turn the delicate 
situation (in Lithuania) into a confrontation" between Moscow and Vilnius, a 
U.S. official explained. 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian Parliament is expected to declare independence, or perhaps a 
goal of eventual independence, after which "acceptable solutions should be 
negotiated" to the complex legal, economic and political problems arising from 
the divorce, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian charge d'affaires in Washington, Stasys Lozoraitis Jr., said "we 
understand fully the U.S. position." 
</P>
<P>
"There is no point in offending or irritating the Soviets, and if something 
happened to Gorbachev, the next man may not be better. The day will come one 
day to exchange ambassadors (between Washington and Vilnius), but not now," 
Lozoraitus said. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, it would be incorrect to recognize a new government which has no real 
powers yet," he added. "After the vote, Lithuania will still be part of the 
Soviet Union in practical terms for some time." 
</P>
<P>
The Parliament must pass new laws regarding ownership, and agreements must be 
reached with Moscow on separating a myriad of interlocking systems and 
institutions, from telephone and transportation networks to banks and military 
forces.

Inspired in part by a letter written by Nobel Peace laureate Andrei D. Sakharov 
just before his death, the United States has agreed to join the Soviet Union in 
operating the first orbiting radiotelescope, the two countries announced 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In a joint appearance, Vice President Dan Quayle and Soviet Ambassador Yuri V. 
Dubinin hailed the venture as a harbinger of a new era of cooperation between 
the world's dominant space powers. Quayle called it a "significant step," to be 
followed by a "fresh look at international cooperation and all of the options 
that will be available to us." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials plan to launch their Radioastron telescope into Earth orbit 
sometime between 1993 and 1995. Its 33-foot antenna dish will be tuned to 
distant galaxies and objects such as neutron stars and pulsars, which present 
intriguing clues about the nature of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
Under the arrangement between the two countries, the United States will provide 
ground-based recorder terminals to receive and process data transmitted by the 
telescope. It also will make U.S. radiotelescope dishes in this country and in 
the Southern Hemisphere available to work in conjunction with the orbiting 
Soviet instrument. 
</P>
<P>
American scientists will be asked to join Soviet colleagues in planning the 
two-to-five-year mission, including the selection of stars and galaxies to be 
studied. 
</P>
<P>
Details regarding the use of U.S. radiotelescopes in the effort still are being 
worked out by the National Science Foundation and the National Radio Astronomy 
Observatory. But National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials said 
the use of American dishes will permit the orbiting Soviet instrument to make 
useful observations 90% of the time while it is on orbit, instead of 40% 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen other nations also are participating in the venture. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the most notable cooperative venture between the United States and 
Soviet space programs was in July, 1975, when an American Apollo spacecraft 
made an orbital rendezvous and docked with a Soviet Soyuz vehicle, allowing 
astronaut crews to exchange visits. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev proposed in 1987 that the two countries 
cooperate in the exploration of Mars. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, NASA Administrator Richard Truly received a letter from 
Sakharov, the famed Soviet physicist and political dissident, urging the United 
States to participate with the Soviets in the Radioastron project. 
</P>
<P>
It was said to have been one of the last letters signed by Sakharov before he 
died last Dec. 14 from an apparent heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, American space officials already were looking for potential 
cooperative undertakings with the Soviets. Truly referred the letter to the 
National Space Council. Quayle, the panel's chairman, became interested and 
pursued it with Soviet officials. 
</P>
<P>
The recording equipment the United States will provide for the Radioastron 
project already has been designed, and an export licensed has been obtained to 
ship four units to the Soviet Union for use in the project. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to lending recording and processing equipment, the United States 
will make its tracking and data acquisition network around the world available 
to support the mission. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle declined to speculate where the cooperative undertaking may lead, but he 
said the Bush Administration believes that the United States is "entering a 
golden era in relation to space exploration." 
</P>
<P>
The endeavor, Dubinin predicted, will be a "good and wonderful project," the 
beginning of "a new phase" in U.S.-Soviet relations.

LEADERS SLOW IN DEALING WITH CRISES, KGB SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the KGB, the Soviet Union's security service, have accused the 
country's leadership of acting too slowly to deal with its multiple crises and 
declared that they will act without hesitation to protect the socialist system 
here if they see it threatened by the growing political turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
In extraordinary public appeal to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, members of 
the KGB's headquarters staff warned as well of growing divisions within the 
Communist Party, weakening its ability to lead the country, and politicians 
they see as power-hungry speculators masquerading as advocates of reform. 
</P>
<P>
"Cheka (KGB) collectives say they are perplexed because the leading organs of 
the country, while possessing the data that anticipated developing negative 
phenomena, clearly lagged with vitally important political decisions and are 
still too slow and indecisive," the KGB officers said in their open letter. 
</P>
<P>
"Gambling on glasnost and the pluralism of opinions, loud-mouthed advocates of 
(certain) social interests denigrate the sacred name of Lenin and the notions 
of Motherland, patriotism and October (the Bolshevik Revolution) that are so 
dear to every Soviet person." 
</P>
<P>
The three-page letter, addressed to members of the Congress of People's 
Deputies, the Soviet Parliament, as well as to Gorbachev, expresses firm 
support for perestroika, Gorbachev's program of reforms, but warns that it is 
endangered by the present crises. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, a copy of which was made available this week by liberal deputies to 
the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda and the independent Soviet news service 
Postfactum, reflects both the intense political struggle under way over the 
country's future course and the anxiety about its outcome. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Gorbachev has enjoyed the KGB's full support, according to most 
political observers here, and the current chairman, Gen. Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, 
is his appointment and, until now, assumed to be a close supporter. 
</P>
<P>
But the letter is as strongly critical of Gorbachev by implication as it is of 
radical politicians well to his left, and it above all questions the quality of 
his leadership. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, said to have been approved at a recent meeting of KGB headquarters 
staff members, contained a hard-edged warning: 
</P>
<P>
"Soviet Cheka (KGB) forces act and will act firmly, consistently and reliably 
in the interests of the people. They will protect the security of the socialist 
system, the rights and freedom of each person and our socialist democracy." 
</P>
<P>
On paper, this is precisely the KGB's legal duty. Under Soviet law, the 
Committee for State Security, as the KGB is formally known, is charged with the 
defense of the country's socialist system from attempts to overthrow it as well 
as with intelligence-gathering and counter-intelligence tasks. 
</P>
<P>
But liberal deputies interpreted the letter, presented as the opinion of KGB 
members rather than the organization itself, as a veiled threat.

U.S. CONCERNS GROWING THAT A UNITED GERMANY MAY BOLT FROM NATO; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: WASHINGTON COURTS AN EAST GERMAN POLITICIAN. HE FAVORS A NEW 
SECURITY SYSTEM.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A little more than four months ago, the Rev. Markus Meckel was summoning 
dissidents to meetings in dank church basements in East Germany, planning 
nonviolent marches in hope of spurring his country's Communist regime toward 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
This week, the soft-spoken Lutheran minister got Washington's version of the 
red carpet treatment as he was bustled from plush offices at the State 
Department to elegant reception rooms in the Capitol to tell an attentive Bush 
Administration and Congress what he plans for his country now. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not used to this kind of thing," mused the bearded Meckel, now vice 
chairman of East Germany's fledgling Social Democratic Party, as he blinked 
into the lights of a television camera crew. 
</P>
<P>
Meckel's sudden prestige in Washington stems only partly from the fact that he 
may turn out to be East Germany's new foreign minister if his party comes out 
on top, as forecast, in the country's first free elections March 18. 
</P>
<P>
More important, it reflects a new surge in concern among U.S. officials over 
whether a reunified Germany will want to remain a member of the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization, the military alliance that has been the cornerstone of 
U.S. strategy in Europe for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration and the West German government of Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl have publicly agreed that the new Germany will stay solidly in NATO -- 
even though some Soviet troops may still be stationed on East German soil. 
</P>
<P>
But not all Germans agree. Last week, Oskar Lafontaine, the probable candidate 
of the West German Social Democrats to run against Kohl in elections scheduled 
for December, said that the idea of a united Germany in NATO is "a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
And Meckel, the East German Social Democrat, told U.S. officials this week that 
his party wants to see "a new kind of European security system." 
</P>
<P>
"The German Democratic Republic (East Germany) cannot be a part of NATO the way 
NATO is today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We come from the peace movement," he added, in a message that did not bring 
much reassurance to the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Both West German and East German leaders have assured U.S. officials that they 
will not push for an immediate withdrawal from NATO as reunification nears. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to leave NATO, nor do we propose its dissolution," said Horst 
Ehmke, a West German Social Democrat who also came to Washington this week to 
reassure the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, he warned, the German public's support for NATO 
membership -- and for the presence of U.S. troops in Germany -- is bound to 
shrink as the Soviet threat to Western security appears ever smaller. 
</P>
<P>
"NATO is the structure we have," a senior State Department official said. "We 
think it's the best guarantee of continued stability in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
NATO's military strategy has long rested on large deployments of U.S. and other 
allied forces in West Germany, the pact's front line with the countries that 
used to be called the Soviet Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, U.S. military planners, recognizing the political realities, are 
quietly drawing up plans to defend the alliance with much smaller numbers of 
U.S. troops -- and even with a Germany outside of NATO, a senior military 
official said this week. 
</P>
<P>
The United States now has nearly 275,000 troops in West Germany. Last month, 
President Bush agreed to reduce that number to no more than 195,000 if the 
Soviet Union does the same on its side. 
</P>
<P>
But senior U.S. officials acknowledged that if Soviet troop strength in Central 
Europe drops much below 195,000, the United States will be forced to follow. 
</P>
<P>
Army Gen. John Galvin, NATO's military commander, told a Senate committee this 
week that the proposed level of 195,000 U.S. troops is an absolute minimum if 
the alliance is to continue using its present strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Some members of Congress have questioned whether Bush and Secretary of State 
James A. Baker III made a bad deal with the Soviet Union last month when they 
agreed to the 195,000 level, plus another 30,000 U.S. troops in other European 
countries such as Britain and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
"What would happen if the price of (German) reunification demanded by the 
Soviets was the removal of all foreign forces, American and Soviet?" Sen. Wyche 
Fowler Jr. (D-Ga.) asked Baker in a Senate hearing. "Where would our troops 
go?" 
</P>
<P>
Baker conceded that, under the U.S.-Soviet deal, all American troops in Germany 
would probably have to come home if a new German state asked them to leave. But 
Baker and other Administration officials dismissed that as unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
"Our worry, frankly, is not that the Germans are going to ask us to leave, but 
that some folks up here (in Congress) are going to ask us to leave," Baker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Former Defense Secretary James R. Schlesinger disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"The invitation extended by West Germany to U.S. forces is going to be reviewed 
by the German government and the opposition," he said. "Sixty percent of the 
(German) public believes that neutrality is desirable. A majority believes all 
foreign forces should leave Germany." 
</P>
<P>
He said many Europeans quietly want American troops to stay in Europe to "watch 
the Germans. . . But what incentive is there for the Germans to provide us the 
real estate with which to watch them?"

A loose bolt that failed to support an electric motor led to Wednesday's subway 
derailment that killed three and injured scores of others, a federal 
investigator said Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
John Lauber, who heads a team of investigators from the National Transportation 
Safety Board, said the support bolt on a motor under the third car failed, 
causing the motor to swing down and drag along the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Lauber said the six-car train derailed when the motor slammed into a switch on 
the tracks near the busy 30th Street Station.

Three Northwest Airlines pilots were arrested on suspicion of being under the 
influence of alcohol after they landed a commercial flight from Fargo, N.D., 
here Thursday, airport police said. 
</P>
<P>
The three arrested were the captain, first officer and second officer in charge 
of Flight 650, which left Fargo at 6 a.m. and arrived in the Twin Cities about 
7 a.m., authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Solseth, a Federal Aviation Administration safety inspector, reported 
to police that he suspected that the crew was under the influence of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Larry Cuffe of the airport police said the three pilots, identified as 
Capt. Robert Prouse, 51, of Conyers, Ga.; First Officer Robert Kirchner, 35, of 
Highland Ranch, Colo., and Second Officer Joseph Balzer, 34, of Antioch, Tenn., 
voluntarily provided blood samples to investigators and were released. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Muncaster, an airline spokesman, said the results of the tests will not be 
known for several days. "Until we have those results, the pilots have been 
removed from service," Muncaster said.

A storm that staggered the Rockies with snow sealed parts of the Midwest inside 
a thick layer of ice Thursday, pulling down power lines that serve more than 
90,000 customers in Des Moines, Iowa, and turning roads into skating rinks. 
</P>
<P>
Some major Wyoming highways remained closed for a third day by deep snow, 
idling travelers in motels, restaurants, truck stops and shelters, although 
temperatures rose above freezing. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of schools were closed because ice or snow made travel hazardous, or 
because of lack of electricity, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
South of the snow and ice belt, up to 7 inches of rain fell overnight and 
flooded parts of Arkansas, forcing the evacuation of some homes in Little Rock. 
A school bus was swept off a flooded road and into a ditch, but the young 
passengers were evacuated safely by boat, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Freezing rain during the night brought down tree branches and power lines 
across wide sections of Nebraska, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
Des Moines was hardest hit, with nearly 60% of the customers in the 
metropolitan area blacked out. Police said nearly every street in the city was 
closed or partially closed at some point by downed lines or fallen limbs.

FIGHT BREWS OVER $43 BILLION IN UNSPENT DEFENSE FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A battle is shaping up over $43 billion in unspent Pentagon funds left over 
from the Ronald Reagan Administration's arms buildup, even as Congress is 
seeking to cut military spending. 
</P>
<P>
The funds are contained in two low-profile accounts. And, despite the size of 
the money pot, some people are just noticing that it exists. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) charged Thursday that the Pentagon funds amount 
to a "semi-secret slush fund" that exists largely outside congressional 
jurisdiction. The funds are nearly half as large as the Bush Administration's 
proposed fiscal 1991 military procurement budget. 
</P>
<P>
When the existence of the funds surfaced quietly last year in congressional 
hearings, the General Accounting Office was asked by Rep. John P. Murtha 
(D-Pa.) and Sen. Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii) to investigate whether they were 
being used properly. The GAO found that the money was not being used improperly 
but that the situation constituted a loss of control by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Dingell called for legislation to eliminate the $43-billion funding authority 
held by the Pentagon in the accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokeswoman Susan Hansen denied that the accounts represent a slush 
fund and described them as a kind of reserve held against unexpected or 
unbilled claims by defense contractors. She acknowledged that the $43 billion 
"sounds somewhat like the figures we know." 
</P>
<P>
Hansen said the $43-billion accounts are under the control of the Treasury 
Department and referred questions about their size to Treasury officials. But a 
Treasury spokesman said that the Defense Department controls the funds and that 
the Treasury's only function is to write checks against the money. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy underscores the increasing concern many experts have with the 
Pentagon's accounting system, which was severely criticized only last week in a 
draft GAO audit that was leaked to the press. In that audit, it was disclosed 
that the Air Force had understated its costs on three major weapons systems 
built during the Reagan Administration by $25.5 billion because of sloppy 
accounting. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the entire Pentagon business apparatus has been stung repeatedly 
through the years for its inability to deal effectively with such seemingly 
trivial matters as paying defense contractors on time, handling paper work and 
negotiating adequate contracts. 
</P>
<P>
The $43 billion in unspent Pentagon funding authority is held in a so-called M 
account and a "merged surplus account." The staff of Dingell's House Energy and 
Commerce Committee, which has been investigating the funds, found that $25.3 
billion in authority is held in the merged surplus account and $17.2 billion is 
held in the M account. The Navy holds the largest amount of funds with $9 
billion in its M account and $8 billion in its merged surplus accounts, Dingell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the federal budget system, congressional appropriations lapse after two 
years. It has been widely assumed that all lapsed appropriations are returned 
to the Treasury, but a large portion of those funds ends up in such special 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
The M account is supposed to contain funds to pay for weapons contracts that 
have not yet come due but for which the two-year appropriation has lapsed. The 
merged surplus account theoretically contains lapsed appropriations that would 
be used to pay off unexpected claims against the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way we are able to use those funds is if an obligation was made on a 
previous contract and a bill is forthcoming that was not expected," Hansen said 
about the M account. As for the merged surplus account, she explained: "Maybe 
somebody can bring a battleship out of mothballs and present a bill that goes 
back that far." 
</P>
<P>
But a Dingell staff member said funds in the merged surplus account can be used 
to pay virtually any claim against the government, using funds appropriated for 
one weapon to pay for another. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the Air Force used its M account to pay about $1 billion to Eaton 
Corp. to fix the B-1 bomber avionics system, which failed to meet its 
contractual requirements and left the bomber unable to fulfill its mission of 
penetrating Soviet air defenses.

EX-YACHT DEALER ARRESTED IN ALLEGED THEFT OF $2 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Newport Beach luxury yacht dealer who allegedly stole more than $2 
million from his clients and then wrote them cheerful letters and Christmas 
cards as he traveled the world on their money has been arrested in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Toni Bell, 51, who allegedly left the United States with more than $2 million 
that his customers had deposited for custom yachts he promised to build, was 
arrested at a recreation vehicle dealership in Winter Park, Fla., on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bell left Spindrift Yachts in November, 1987, after telling his top executives 
he did not plan "to be 50 and broke," according to Ft. Lauderdale Police 
Detective Kevin Allen. Warrants for his arrest were issued shortly after. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, some of the alleged victims said it was their turn to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
"We opened a bottle of champagne this morning," said Richard Donner, director 
and producer of the movies "Lethal Weapon" and "Lethal Weapon II." Donner said 
he lost about $30,000 that he had given Bell as a deposit on a 58-foot yacht. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Bell victimized 25 clients, including several from Southern 
California, whose losses ranged from $5,000 to $650,000 apiece. Bell was being 
held in Ft. Lauderdale on $955,000 bail.

NEW TALKS ON U.S. BASES IN PHILIPPINES SET FOR MID-APRIL

<P>
Negotiations to extend the stay of U.S. military bases were set for mid-April, 
and their success depends on how the United States explains aid cuts, the 
foreign secretary said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
No specific agenda has been set for the preliminary talks, said Foreign 
Secretary Raul Manglapus. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an exploratory talk. We don't expect commitments," he said. "We will 
have to assess the responses and attitudes of the U.S. government in order to 
help us arrive at our own decision." 
</P>
<P>
He said the Philippines is particularly interested in hearing the reasons why 
Congress cut $96 million in aid in January. 
</P>
<P>
Some Filipinos consider the reduction a violation of the October, 1988, 
agreement under which the United States offered to give the Philippines about

IT'S OFFICIAL: KOVIC WON'T RUN FOR CONGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ron Kovic officially declared Thursday that he has decided against seeking the 
Democratic nomination to challenge Rep. Robert K. Dornan, (R-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
A statement released by Kovic, the wounded Vietnam veteran whose life story is 
told in the movie "Born on the Fourth of July," gave no reason for bowing out. 
</P>
<P>
The statement said: "After much careful thought and consideration, I have 
decided not to run. I love this country very much, so I will continue to speak 
out and support political candidates and issues which articulate the vision of 
a new, even better America and a more peaceful world." 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of Kovic, who became a leading anti-war activist after he returned 
from Vietnam, challenging Dornan, a conservative known for his colorful 
rhetoric, had attracted nationwide interest. 
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday, Kovic told associates he had decided not to run. At the time, 
however, Kovic refused to confirm that for reporters.

UNIFORM TAXI FARES OKD FOR AIRPORT ONLY; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSIT: CAB COMPANY OFFICIALS FEAR CONFUSION AND PROBLEMS FROM THE PLAN. THEY 
SAY REGULATION IS NEEDED THROUGHOUT SAN DIEGO, NOT JUST AT LINDBERGH FIELD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Transit officials on Thursday ignored a recommendation to require uniform taxi 
fares in San Diego and instead approved a plan requiring cab companies to 
charge $1.50 per mile for trips to and from the airport. 
</P>
<P>
At a rancorous meeting, the Metropolitan Transit Development Board voted, 8-5, 
to reject a recommendation by its own staff for standard fares within San 
Diego, including airport trips, and opted for a proposal that left many cab 
owners angry and confused. Afterward, several cab company officials complained 
that board members have no knowledge of the industry they are supposed to be 
regulating. 
</P>
<P>
The new fare, including $1.40 for the flag drop, will become effective June 1, 
said Barbara Lupro, MTDB paratransit regulatory administrator. Thursday's 
approval is subject to two more reviews by the board, usually the routine 
second readings of a new ordinance that are required by law. 
</P>
<P>
Some board members argued against doing away with the current variable rate 
structure on grounds that such a move would be regulatory and counter to the 
free enterprise system. 
</P>
<P>
"This free enterprise is a bunch of garbage. We have no free enterprise," said 
Alfredo Hueso, an owner of USA Cab Co. "We feel that we enlightened these 
people two months ago to the need for a uniform rate. Now they've turned around 
and are acting as politicians. I don't know of any industry that is not 
regulated. This whole notion of maintaining a free enterprise system is a very 
simplistic argument. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that we have a group of politicians regulating the taxi 
industry who don't know the first thing about the business," Hueso added. "The 
sadder thing is that they aren't trying to learn. I saw members there who had 
never attended board meetings before and they participated in the vote like 
they knew what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
Hueso and a majority of taxi owners favored a uniform rate for cabs in order to 
end complaints from tourists and visitors who are unaware of the city's 
variable rate system and often complain of being ripped off. It is not unusual 
for a cab rider to pay different rates going to and from one location, if he 
uses different cab companies. 
</P>
<P>
"For the most part, the industry wanted a uniform rate throughout and was very 
emphatic about letting the board know," Lupro said. 
</P>
<P>
The board's decision to limit uniform fares to airport trips was intended in 
part to placate Lindbergh Field officials, who receive dozens of complaints 
every year from irate passengers who think they are victimized by the variable 
fares. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego is the only major metropolitan city in the United States that does 
not have uniform taxi rates. The MTDB staff had recommended a fare structure of 
$1.60 per mile and $1.40 for the flag drop. The proposed fares would have put 
San Diego in line with fares charged by cabbies in San Francisco and Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Palmeri, vice president and general manager of Yellow Cab, the largest 
taxi company in the city, warned that the board's action will create more 
problems than it solves. Palmeri tried unsuccessfully to tell transit officials 
that some cab companies that currently have cheaper rates will be required to 
charge higher fares for airport trips. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be cumbersome. Some companies are going to have to install two 
meters in the cab. One for downtown trips and another for airport trips. If the 
cheaper companies charge the cheaper rate for airport trips, they'll be 
breaking the law," Palmeri said. "Can you imagine telling a tourist that the 
fare painted on the door doesn't apply to airport trips? That it'll cost you 
more to go to the airport? 
</P>
<P>
"It's crazy. They've made a mistake. If they're going to take this route, what 
they should do is limit the $1.50 per mile fare to trips originating at the 
airport." 
</P>
<P>
About 900 cabs operate in San Diego, but only 450 are authorized to pick up 
passengers at the airport terminals. Of the 450 cabs with airport medallions, 
only 150 are permitted to work at Lindbergh Field on any given day, and a cab 
can work at the airport only on every third day. 
</P>
<P>
Cab fares in San Diego range from $1.20 per mile to $1.80. Palmeri said that, 
with the exception of Coast Cab and Co-Op Cab, most cab companies currently 
charge $1.60 per mile and $1.20 for the flag drop. 
</P>
<P>
Vic Burnett, a member of the Co-Op board of directors, said his company's fares 
are $1.40 per mile and $1 for the flag drop. Coast charges $1.20 per mile and 
$1 for the flag drop. 
</P>
<P>
Burnett and Parvis Ebrahimi, owner of Coast Cab, were the two biggest opponents 
of a uniform fare. 
</P>
<P>
"We've used the open (variable) rate system for a marketing plan. It works well 
for us," Burnett said. "We have good commercial, corporate and medical 
accounts, a steady stream of customers in addition to the customers who call 
in. The higher airport fare doesn't matter too much to us, because we don't 
work the airport." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Burnett's and Ebrahimi's companies are permitted to pick up passengers 
at the airport, but have to pay parking fees, and pickups are limited to 
designated areas of the parking lot. Their cabs are not permitted to wait at 
the curb, outside the terminals. Both companies are also allowed to take 
passengers to the airport.

BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE IN LOBSTER MECCA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For more than a quarter of a century, lobster fisherman John Guth has weathered 
all sorts of unkind elements in pursuit of the stubborn little crustacean that 
has put food on his table and those thick flannel shirts on his back. 
</P>
<P>
There are the unpredictable ocean currents that play havoc with his submerged 
traps. There are the gentle coastal breezes that, without a moment's notice, 
can become gales strong enough to make even a brawny powerboat stand still in 
the water. 
</P>
<P>
And then there are the lowly lobster poachers, the pirate divers who, under the 
cover of night, can fleece a whole set of traps, robbing local lobster 
fishermen of thousands of dollars a year. 
</P>
<P>
But now fishermen like Guth -- a rugged man with strong, steady hands -- are 
facing an element more fickle than anything the moody Pacific could throw their 
way. 
</P>
<P>
Now, they say, they're doing battle with the whims of politicians. 
</P>
<P>
In January, following through on the brainchild of Encinitas City Council 
members, state legislators passed a bill to create an ocean sanctuary along a 
half-mile strip of coastline in the city, effectively putting it off-limits to 
commercial and sport fishermen, tide pool robbers, even divers looking for 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
The new marine refuge stretches south from D Street at Moonlight Beach to the 
southern edge of Swami's Point, a popular surfing spot noted for an extensive 
reef system that stretches well beyond the breakers. The rugged ocean 
outcropping serves as a feeding ground for an array of fish, and it harbors 
perhaps the most abundant crop of lobster north of La Jolla Cove, which is 
already designated a marine reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the tide pools that appear as the ocean recedes each day provide 
homes for sea anemones, crabs, sea cucumbers and other flora and fauna of the 
Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, sponsored by Assemblywoman Sunny Mojonnier (R-Encinitas), was 
designed to protect the ecologically rich coastline, prohibiting the harvesting 
of all manner of marine life from the tide pools and reefs up to 600 feet 
offshore. 
</P>
<P>
But self-employed fishermen such as Guth see the law as just another threat to 
their already beleaguered industry, locking them out of the fertile waters that 
provide their keep. 
</P>
<P>
"In this line of work, we're at the mercy of the elements, the thieves and the 
poachers and the unpredictable ocean," Guth said Thursday morning as he 
repaired lobster traps on the 35-foot Stephanie D, moored in Oceanside Harbor. 
"Now it's the politicians and bureaucrats as well. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been fishing those waters for generations and we've never harmed the 
ecosystem there. But as soon as Encinitas becomes a city, these new politicians 
want to go out and save the world. Well, this little part of the world has 
already been saved." 
</P>
<P>
The fishermen cite the 1972 Tidal Invertebrate Act, which protects most 
invertebrates within 1,000 feet of the shoreline. An exclusion in the act 
allows commercial and sport fishermen to harvest lobsters in the zone, as long 
as they keep to limits imposed by the state Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
The fishermen hope to gain a similar exclusion for the marine refuge, which 
they say wasn't necessary in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like putting a stop sign in the middle of the desert," said Guth, a 
48-year-old Encinitas resident. "It's useless." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Heiserman, administrative assistant for Mojonnier, said the intent of the 
legislation is not to put the lobstermen out of business. "That's not what we 
set out to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, several lobstermen met with Mojonnier, Encinitas city officials and 
marine life experts to strike a compromise that would allow them to continue 
plying their trade within the rich coastal waters. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Mojonnier agreed to refer the law to legislative council in 
Sacramento to determine whether licensed fishermen should be allowed inside the 
protected area, as the lobstermen and their lawyer claim. 
</P>
<P>
The reefs are worth fighting for, fishermen say. The refuge is home to abundant 
numbers of lobsters because of the rocky clefts and crevices where the 
creatures seek cover. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like we can fish the entire coast; there's only a few places that 
support the lobsters in those kind of numbers," Guth said. "And what's to stop 
the guy in Solana Beach or someplace else from wanting to put a refuge in front 
of his house -- where's it going to end?" 
</P>
<P>
Dave Wigginton, director of community services for Encinitas, said the refuge 
was intended to protect the tide pools that were being stripped by people 
walking on the beach at low tide. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Anne Omsted, he said, had noticed a drastic reduction of marine 
life in the pools because of the "free-lance harvesting." 
</P>
<P>
While the lobstermen claim their harvests don't disrupt the fragile ecology, 
Wigginton said that city officials aren't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what they say, but I've been shown no proof one way or the other. I'm 
not a biologist," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials also worry that the dangerous traps sometimes drift ashore in bad 
weather or are a hazard to surfers, including one youth who was killed off 
Carlsbad State Beach in 1985 when his surfboard leash became tangled in a trap 
line. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Wigginton said, there has already been compromise. The original scope 
of the refuge extended to a mile offshore. After the lobstermen complained, it 
was reduced to the present 600 feet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Guth said many fishermen are miffed because they were never consulted over the 
new refuge. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't care what happens to us," he said. "We don't matter; we're just a 
few old dinosaurs, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual alliance, the commercial lobstermen have even received support 
from the state Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Swartzell, a marine biologist for the agency, told officials at the recent 
meeting that he thought the refuge was redundant to existing state laws 
protecting the area. 
</P>
<P>
"We should have laws and regulations only to the extent that we achieve what 
we're trying to achieve. They shouldn't restrict beyond that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the objective is to have life in the tide pool area where people can 
examine invertebrates and plants in their environment, I don't think that 
having lobster fishermen in the area is going to affect that." 
</P>
<P>
One solution, officials say, would be to offer special permits to the dozen or 
so lobstermen who regularly harvest in the area. But the last thing Guth and 
others say they need is another permit. 
</P>
<P>
"I've already got 500 permits," he said. "We're under the gun all the time from 
all these agencies. It's just another club they have to hang over your head." 
</P>
<P>
Guth, who also fishes his 500 traps off San Clemente Island, says the plan will 
most likely affect the smaller-scale lobstermen whose boats are too tiny to 
venture very far from shore. 
</P>
<P>
"It means up to a third of their earnings," he said. "Some of them could go out 
of business, lose the livelihoods their fathers taught them." 
</P>
<P>
Some of them have already left. Last year, a good friend of Guth's packed in 
his traps and moved to Wyoming. "He said he was sick and tired of dealing with 
all the politics," Guth said. 
</P>
<P>
While reducing the pool of lobstermen in North County may be healthy in the 
long run, Guth doesn't want to see any veteran fishermen robbed of their 
hard-earned professions. 
</P>
<P>
"They're reducing our territory all the time," he said. "We're like a can of 
worms. Or a bunch of snapping lobsters in a trap." 
</P>
<P>
For now, officials say, they may be saved by the bell. Lobster season ends this 
month and doesn't open again until October. By then, they hope to have found a 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, officials say, they'll begin laying the buoys that will effectively 
wall off North County lobstermen from yet another fertile fishing ground. 
</P>
<P>
As he hauls his traps in for the summer, John Guth can only shake his head. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, he says, fishermen are their own worst enemies. They're loners who 
rarely agree on anything -- independent men with temperaments better fit for 
the open ocean, not City Council chambers. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I became a fisherman," he said, "to get away from these 
well-intentioned but uninformed politicians who want to save the world."

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE / ANTHONY PERRY: FIGHT FOR RESTROOM SPACE BECOMES THEATER OF 
THE ABSURD 
</P>

<P>
I've been getting mail from the La Jolla Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
I got an announcement that the first production of 1990 will be "The Cherry 
Orchard" starring Lynn Redgrave. It begins May 13. 
</P>
<P>
I got the theater's latest Stabilization Campaign Update. It says the financial 
wolf has been temporarily chased from the door. 
</P>
<P>
But nothing I've received addresses a more urgent issue: Does the playhouse 
plan to continue its hideous practice of sometimes blocking the men's room so 
it can be used by women? 
</P>
<P>
I encountered this barbarity in November during an otherwise superb production 
of "Macbeth." It was a fine evening of political intrigue and homicidal 
power-grabbing. 
</P>
<P>
I saw a member of the San Diego City Council in the audience, taking notes. 
(Name available upon request). 
</P>
<P>
As the Queen of Evil finished her speech, and the lights came up for 
intermission, I rushed to the lobby. An usher halted me at the door to the 
men's room. 
</P>
<P>
"Sorry," he said, "we let the women use the men's room first to accommodate the 
'overflow' from the women's room." 
</P>
<P>
I grimaced. I hopped from foot to foot. I suffered until the men's room was 
returned to its rightful users. 
</P>
<P>
After I got the news about the new season, I decided to call the La Jolla 
Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
I was informed that more women than men attend the theater. Plus, women are 
slower at some tasks than men. 
</P>
<P>
I learned that I was not the first male to complain. But until a financial 
angel provides roomier restrooms, letting women use the men's room is seen as 
the only way to eliminate queuing. 
</P>
<P>
I discovered, however, that the usher who barred me had violated policy. Policy 
says women can use the men's restroom only after the crush of early-arriving 
men has cleared out. 
</P>
<P>
Ushers will be instructed anew of this before "The Cherry Orchard" begins. 
</P>
<P>
See, and you thought the press never does anything worthwhile. 
</P>

* Bad news for two Assembly members from San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
In a poll by the California Journal, Peter Chacon (D-San Diego) placed 78th out 
of 79 members in overall integrity, intelligence, energy and effectiveness. 
Sunny Mojonnier (R-Encinitas) was 71st. 
</P>
<P>
The Sacramento-based magazine surveyed 220 legislators, lobbyists, staffers and 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Critics dismiss the poll as unscientific. But the results are already being 
used as a weapon by campaign opponents. 
</P>
<P>
* Jim and Heidi O'Hern have opened a family business in their Fallbrook home: 
Arm A Dec International. 
</P>
<P>
For $35 an hour, they'll check news stories about firearms and munitions before 
publication for accuracy. They're plugged in by fax and phone. 
</P>
<P>
The O'Herns say too many stories about hot topics like assault rifles are 
loaded with errors. 
</P>
<P>
Jim is a Marine staff sergeant at Camp Pendleton. Heidi, a former Marine 
sharpshooter, is an explosives handler at the Fallbrook Naval Weapons Station. 
</P>
<P>
* From an account in the (Escondido) Times-Advocate of gonzo journalist Hunter 
S. Thompson's recent visit to the Belly Up Tavern: 
</P>
<P>
"Thompson brushed some residual vomit off his camouflage trousers and ordered a 
Heineken at the airport bar . . . During the 20-minute drive to Solana Beach, 
Thompson . . . poured some Heineken into his cupped hand and inhaled it 
vigorously through his nose.

</P>
<P>
* The Fieldstone Co. says it's reviewing its "VIP presale policy," which gives 
preference to certain city and county officials in buying new homes. 
</P>
<P>
The review panel will consist of a clergyman, an academic and a judge. As yet 
unselected. 
</P>
<P>
* More bureaucratese: Calendar as a verb. As in, "Let's calendar that."

Turn back the calendar, I say.

DEFENDANT TESTIFIES HE HATED EX-WIFE BUT DIDN'T KILL HER

"Did you kill Anne Jenkins?" 
</P>
<P>
"No." 
</P>
<P>
"Your witness." 
</P>
<P>
With that one question, defense attorney Alan May took his seat in the Vista 
courtroom and let his client, David Scott Harrison, spar with prosecutor Larry 
Burns in a non-jury trial to determine if Harrison killed his ex-wife, Anne 
Jenkins, on Feb. 17, 1988, a month after she and her new husband won $727,000 
in the state lottery. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Harrison admitted, he did hate his former wife -- as well as her parents 
and her new husband. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, he did bomb a van owned by the first wife of Anne Jenkins' second husband. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, he did distribute flyers -- including, perhaps, one to Joan Kroc -- 
accusing Anne Jenkins' father of being a child molester. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, he did harass her family by forging change-of-address and phone-number 
forms, and, yes, he did buy a magazine advertisement soliciting homosexual 
lovers for his former father-in-law, Harry Wanket. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, he did read books on how to commit the perfect murder, and, yes, he did 
try to hide those books, as well as a knife and pipe bomb fixings, in a 
friend's house just three days before Anne Jenkins was killed. 
</P>
<P>
David Scott Harrison smiled. 
</P>
<P>
And Larry Burns, pacing back and forth and circling Harrison like a predator, 
smiled back. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't it true, Burns asked Harrison, that you lied in court documents relating 
to your divorce from Anne Jenkins? 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Harrison said. 
</P>
<P>
You perjured yourself, Burns told Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison raised his eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't it true, Burns asked Harrison, that, in a previous federal court trial, 
you considered displaying a picture of your two children so the jury could see 
them and maybe sympathize with you? 
</P>
<P>
Burns smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"That's correct," Harrison said. He smiled back. 
</P>
<P>
Burns asked Harrison if he was fascinated with murder. Harrison said, yes, he 
was interested, but fascinated? 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney May objected to the wording of the question. Burns sat down in 
the jury box, next to a line of reporters. May sat back down. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't it true, Burns asked Harrison, that you fraudulently applied the state 
seal to phony birth certificates for your two children? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, he said. "I lawfully possessed (the embosser)." 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge David B. Moon Jr., who is deciding the case without a 
jury, did a double-take and looked toward Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
"You believed you lawfully possessed it?" the judge asked. 
</P>
<P>
"It was never stolen," Harrison said. "It was ordered through a stationery 
store in San Marcos." 
</P>
<P>
Isn't it true, Burns asked, that you had a double-edged knife? Yes, Harrison 
said. "You didn't want the police to find you in possession of the knife after 
Feb. 17, did you?" Burns asked. 
</P>
<P>
"That's correct," Harrison answered politely. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at the attorneys' table, May was thumbing through the how-to murder 
books found in Harrison's duffel bag after the killing. He smiled, leaned over 
to one of the prosecutor's investigators, pointed something out to him, and 
smiled some more. The detective smiled, but only for a moment. 
</P>
<P>
Now it was May's turn to question Harrison again. 
</P>
<P>
"On or about that time, were you a blithering idiot?" 
</P>
<P>
Harrison looked confused. His eyebrows raised. "No." 
</P>
<P>
"Who did you think the first person would be that Gary Jenkins (Anne's husband) 
would point the finger at?" 
</P>
<P>
"Myself," Harrison said. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you have to be guilty to think you were a suspect?" 
</P>
<P>
"No." 
</P>
<P>
May picked up one of the how-to murder books and looked at the judge. "We 
encourage the court," May said, smiling, "to read these books. They really are 
fascinating." He flipped through the pages and highlighted parts that he 
particularly liked. Death by bacteria injection, so no one even suspects 
murder. And, oh, how about mass murder, so a particular motive to kill one of 
the victims -- the real target -- can't easily be identified? May smiled. 
</P>
<P>
May focused back on his client. Are you afraid of a frame job? he asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, very much," Harrison said. 
</P>
<P>
"Why?" 
</P>
<P>
"Because I didn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
"Do you believe innocent people can be convicted of murder?" May asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Completely, now." 
</P>
<P>
Why didn't you find any witnesses at your Del Mar Heights condo complex to 
vouch for your alibi that you were home, pool side, the afternoon of the 
killing? 
</P>
<P>
"At that time," Harrison said, "I still had faith in the system. I didn't think 
I'd have to go out and build a defense." 
</P>
<P>
Do you have any remorse over your ex-wife's death? 
</P>
<P>
"My concern," he said, "was for my kids and myself. I was concerned I was going 
to be blamed for it." 
</P>
<P>
The trial resumes Monday, with Harrison still on the stand.

ROMANCE UNDER THE 'VOLCANO' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The throwaway elegance of Tom Hanks, apparently doomed but ready to live his 
last days to the hilt, and a bravura trio of roles for Meg Ryan are only two of 
the elements that make "Joe Versus the Volcano" bubble. (It's citywide.) 
Romantic and preposterous all at once, it's actually a funny, endearing fable 
about courage, love and faith. 
</P>
<P>
So endearing that the flatness about its last few minutes manages not to sink 
the picture. The ending has a quick, cheerful texture that usually signals the 
presence of market research or audience-testing. Hard to know for certain, but 
there's a quickly-tied-together feeling to it blessedly missing from the rest 
of the movie. 
</P>
<P>
To some it may not even matter; with an Alan Rudolph sort of seductiveness, 
"Joe" creates its own world, then Shanghais us into it. By the movie's end, we 
may be such goners that we don't fuss when it ends in less of a burst of 
inventiveness than it unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
Witty, disarming and beautiful, "Joe" is the tip-off that John Patrick Shanley 
is at least as distinctive a director as he has already been a playwright and 
screenwriter -- with "Four Corners," "The January Man" and "Moonstruck" before 
this. It's a lovely debut. 
</P>
<P>
The slyly stylized production opens with Hanks' Joe Banks marching off to his 
wretched job at a medical-supply conglom, American Panascope, with hundreds of 
other gray nonentities. There, among looming sets that the German 
Expressionists would have died for, he and DeDe (a lank-haired, nasal Meg Ryan) 
work for a dumb, despicable boss (Dan Hedaya) under buzzing fluorescent lights 
that indeed seem to be sucking their eyeballs. 
</P>
<P>
Presumably, Joe would be there yet, if his hypochondria hadn't steered him to 
yet another doctor (Robert Stack). This one is different; he breaks the news 
that Joe has the ideal movie disease, a brain cloud. No symptoms. Perfect 
health, then, powie! His prescription: Live the time he has left to its 
fullest. 
</P>
<P>
Next day, the means with which Joe can live it appear at his ratty apartment. 
Like a leprechaun on LSD, Lloyd Bridges' billionaire Graynamore offers him the 
world -- or at least unlimited credit in this world -- and at the end of it, a 
quick, sacrificial dive into an angry volcano half an ocean away. It's 
something about the rare mineral on this island of Waponi Woo that Graynamore 
must have. 
</P>
<P>
Joe has had a taste of heroism from the days when he was a fireman, before 
American Panascope's deadly grip. A personal big-bang exit holds not too many 
terrors for him, and besides, this is a fairy tale. He's on. 
</P>
<P>
And we're with him, meeting Graynamore's pair of daughters, half-sisters 
Angelica and Patricia (Meg Ryans Nos. 2 and 3), both of whose lives are lived 
in reaction to their father's money. 
</P>
<P>
Red-haired Angelica, a painter and a poet, is a hip L.A. flower. She talks with 
a breathy gargle that merges Katharine Hepburn with a Valley girl. Surprisingly 
touching, Angelica's only drawback is being on the screen too little. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia, blond, brave and the straightest of the three Ryan characters, is 
skipper of the neat little schooner Tweedle Dee. Without knowing Joe's history, 
she's there to sail him to Waponi Woo, although during the trip -- watching him 
taste life for the first time -- she becomes aware of his essential gallantry 
and uniqueness. Shanley and his inspired collaborators -- production designer 
Bo Welch, cinematographer Stephen Goldblatt, costume designer Colleen Atwood, 
editor Richard Halsey and composer Georges Delerue -- make it a journey worthy 
of Robert Louis Stevenson and Maurice Sendak, with just of hint of David Byrne 
thrown in for the sheer surreal unexpectedness of it. For a light comedy, the 
dialogue has ballast: How interesting to have Patricia admit to soul sickness 
-- that great undiagnosed contemporary malady; to have her suggest something as 
Jungian as the pull that the sea has on one's dreams when one sleeps on a boat, 
or to have the final decision facing Joe and Patricia involve a literal leap of 
faith. 
</P>
<P>
To amplify such thoughts, we have the movie's exquisite visions on land and 
sea: Joe's apartment-front, every window glowing with a different brilliant 
color, the same colors that will blaze from the Chinese paper lanterns on 
Patricia's cozy little boat. A low-hanging moon at sea, magnificent enough to 
bring tears of gratitude to Joe's face, thankful simply for his life -- 
whatever little bit of it he may have left. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe Versus the Volcano"(rated PG) overflows with these visions and a lot that 
are more low-down and hilarious, like costumer Atwood's complete visual 
anthropology of the Waponi Woo. There hasn't been this much fun to look at on a 
screen since "Spinal Tap." 
</P>
<P>
Hanks and all the Ryans are splendid. Joe is anchored by Hanks' bedrock 
humanity and decency, and Shanley has let Hanks' physical puckishness have free 
rein during the floating-trunk sequences. The only complaint to be made about 
Ryan's three very different characters is . . . more. 
</P>
<P>
Other diversions along the way are Ossie Davis' empathetic limo driver, who 
will show Joe how to dress but not who he is, since it's taken Davis' character 
his whole life to learn that for himself. Then there is a veritable sensualist 
of a luggage salesman (Barry McGovern), whose fabulous trunks become almost 
characters in their own right. 
</P>
<P>
If you wish for more depth at the ending, and perhaps at other points too, 
you're not alone; the trick is to savor the trip along the way and to hope that 
Shanley keeps his style and deepens his substance with his next film. 
</P>

Santa Barbara Film Fest Change: Don't wait in line Saturday for the world 
premiere of John Waters' "Cry Baby," the scheduled finale of the Santa Barbara 
International Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
The festival's publicity director, Sheila Barr, said that the film has been 
yanked under orders by its distributor, Universal. She said that festival 
officials were not given an explanation. The film will be replaced by a 
re-screening of "Black Rainbow," starring Rosanna Arquette and Jason Robards. 
Last Saturday, "Black Rainbow" was a sellout and the festival had to turn 400 
people away. BETH KLEID

ABT Names Co-Directors: Jane Hermann, 53, and Oliver Smith, 72, were named 
co-directors of American Ballet Theatre, it was announced Thursday. Smith held 
the title of co-director with Lucia Chase from 1945 to 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement by the ABT board confirms that Hermann will continue to run 
the company artistically as well as administratively. Named ABT executive 
director last September, Hermann said that she originally intended to work 
together with artistic director Mikhail Baryshnikov. She assumed total control 
after Baryshnikov abruptly quit. The company performs in Costa Mesa through 
March 18. "I think I have an enormous amount to do," Hermann told The Times 
Thursday, "but I'm going in to this tremendous challenge with enormous backing 
from the board. It is a great trust and I take it very, very seriously." BETH

POP LP CHART: IT'S ABDUL AND JACKSON, AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ever get the feeling that three months from now Paula Abdul and Janet Jackson 
will still be 1-2 on the Billboard magazine pop album chart? That's the way 
it's been for weeks, though the fact that Jackson has the No. 1 pop single -- 
"Escapade" -- should change things in her favor one of these weeks. Michael 
Bolton's "Soul Provider" -- boosted by hit singles -- moved up three notches to 
No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie Raitt is still basking in the afterglow of her Grammy victories. Her 
"Nick of Time" album jumped 10 more places, to No. 12. Speaking of Grammys, the 
"Beaches" sound track, featuring Bette Midler's Grammy-winning single, "Wind 
Beneath My Wings," is on the rise again -- from No. 60 to No. 38. 
</P>
<P>
* Rapper M.C. Hammer has gotten rapped by some critics for this album, but rap 
fans seem to like it. "Please Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em" leaped from No. 69 to No. 
31.

RITE OF TEEN-AGE PASSAGE IN 'HOUSE PARTY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The actors in "House Party" (citywide), a catchy, often hilarious teen-age sex 
comedy set in an all-black milieu, seem to think musically. That's hardly 
surprising. The cast includes two rap groups, Kid 'n Play and Full Force, as 
heroes and villains, and two actress-dancers, A. J. Johnson and Tisha Campbell 
as female leads. The major adult character, Robin Harris' Pops, is a stand-up 
comic, a wizard at slow, nasty timing. 
</P>
<P>
And "House Party" has been shaped by its makers -- the team of writer-director 
Reggie Hudlin and his producer brother Warrington -- to include big dance 
numbers and slapstick comedy scenes that almost play like dances, full of 
voluptuous, overblown physical gags. Early on, the Hudlins set the tone for 
what's to follow: they blow the roof off a house. A hundred minutes later, they 
cap that gag with their last joke. 
</P>
<P>
This movie has a rhythm. It's exaggerated, loud and consciously vulgar, but the 
breezy self-assurance carries it along. "Party" takes place on a day and night 
when three young high schoolers -- Kid (Christopher Reid), Play (Christopher 
Martin) and Bilal (Martin Lawrence) -- set up a bash at Play's place, 
unchaperoned because his parents are on a trip down South. 
</P>
<P>
What follow is simple, archetypal. Smooth Play keeps picking up women right and 
left, humiliating his "dragon-breathed" wallflower chum Bilal. Kid, grounded by 
his Pops (Harris), because of a school fight, sneaks out. At the party he is 
torn between two school sirens, Sharane (A. J. Johnson) and Sidney (Tisha 
Campbell), who are also being romanced by the insatiable Play. 
</P>
<P>
Kid's nemeses, played by Full Force (the brothers Paul Anthony, Bowlegged Lou 
and B. Fine George) keep crossing his path with increasingly violent results. 
Two white cops (Barry Diamond and Michael Pniewski) cruise around, desultorily 
chewing doughnuts and keeping order. And every party boor imaginable -- from a 
comatose drunk to a guy who keeps bumping into the stereo -- shows up to do a 
number. 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing very new about this, beyond the milieu. Dozens of bad teen sex 
comedies, mostly set in white middle-class suburbs, have similar plots. Very 
few have "House Party's" energy and charm. The charm comes from a number of 
sources: the actors, the brassy camera style, the new territory being tapped. 
And a lot of it comes from Hudlin's mastery of bright inside teen argot. 
</P>
<P>
There's something cheerfully fluent about this dialogue: the way the buddies 
keep saying "That's cold." to indicate harsh behavior, the quick little riffs 
and connotations. Rap is the keynote of the entire movie. Kid 'n Play are 
verbal prestidigitators, who can talk their way out of trouble and Reid and 
Martin play together with brisk chemistry, doing the classic smoothie and 
softie routine with brio and vigor. Where Play is the slickster, Kid, with his 
bizarre hairdo -- an Afro shaped like a pencil eraser -- is more of a natural, 
wide-eyed and sincere. 
</P>
<P>
Kid 'n Play key the movie: the performance level is high throughout. Robin 
Harris, a great insult comedian who played Sweet Dick Willie -- most cynical of 
the three corner men in "Do the Right Thing" -- got swallowed up in the scenery 
around Eddie Murphy in "Harlem Nights." Here he gets into his raw, 
acrid-tongued specialty. Johnson and Campbell are properly sweet and sexy, Full 
Force mean, Lawrence gamy -- and all the minor characters do their running gags 
with sly dispatch. 
</P>
<P>
There's also a cheerful moralism about the film. Like Spike Lee, the Hudlins 
mix up some idealistic notions, in this case about safe sex and responsibility 
and not being cold, with a delight in offbeat mores and street slang. 
</P>
<P>
"House Party" has some lapses and offenses -- including a jail scene where Kid 
fends off potential rapists with a nervous impromptu rap about AIDS, Rock 
Hudson and Liberace. There's an interlude at a pool-side party with local black 
bourgeoisie, which doesn't work as social commentary, music criticism or 
comedy. And it seems strange to hear Harris' Pops wandering around muttering 
about curfews when he knows Kid has snuck off. 
</P>
<P>
But the movie does exactly what a cheerful, unpretentious genre piece should 
do. It connects with its subject and audience, gives us some music, laughs, a 
little sentiment. "House Party" (MPAA rated R for language) is jazzy, sassy, 
dense with hip-hop hip and corny gags. The Hudlins take us right into their 
world, catch the feel of kids at loose ends, hot to trot on a balmy night. It's 
a hearty party.

FREDA PAYNE SHOWS HER VERSATILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Freda Payne's come a long way, baby, since she rode the top of the charts two 
decades ago with "Band of Gold" and "Bring the Boys Home." Wednesday night at 
the Hollywood Roosevelt Cinegrill, the erstwhile soul stylist demonstrated her 
versatility with a well-paced cabaret set that balanced standards, rhythm tunes 
and contemporary numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Payne looked slim, svelte and even more sensually attractive than she did in 
the early '70s. 
</P>
<P>
Her voice has grown and deepened into a warm, husky instrument capable of 
moving easily from the twists and turns of gospel to the brisk rhythms of jazz. 
</P>
<P>
The evening opened on an upbeat with sizzling romps through Duke Ellington's 
"It Don't Mean a Thing If It Ain't Got That Swing" and Toots Thieleman's 
"Bluesette." Shifting into a more contemporary mode, Payne eased smoothly into 
"Another Time," a lush ballad composed by her musical director, pianist Jim 
Vukovitch, then tried out some updated and personalized lyrics on the classic 
"My Favorite Things." 
</P>
<P>
Joined halfway through her set by Tony Orlando's former back-up singers, Dawn, 
Payne sang several rocking rhythm tunes. But she was even more convincing with 
passionate readings of Rodgers &amp; Hart's "Bewitched, Bothered and 
Bewildered" and Bessie Smith's gutsy "You Done Broke Down." 
</P>
<P>
The program peaked with an impressive set piece in which Payne used her 
colorful tonal range to produce striking impressions of Eartha Kitt, Lena Horne 
and Ella Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, it was a splendid performance from a former pop singer who has 
clearly matured into an impressive musical stylist. Payne was accompanied by 
pianist Vukovitch, bassist Lynn Keller, guitarist Randy Mitchell and drummer 
Rich Martinez. She continues at the Cinegrill through Saturday night. DON

STAGE BEAT: 'THE SECRET' DELIVERS A LOT OF COMEDY DESPITE SERIOUS NATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tina Pompeii is a nervous wreck in the waiting room of an abortion clinic in 
Brooklyn. She's also sick. Her food cravings are unbearable. Her older sister 
Angela is unbearable too. Angela thinks Tina should tell Sonny, Tina's 
boyfriend, that she's pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
Are we in for a tract against abortion? Only minimally. Although Lisa Maria 
Radano's "The Secret Sits in the Middle," at the 3rd Street Theatre, spends a 
lot of time talking about abortion, it looks as if this couple is one who 
should have a baby. Eventually, Tina's reasons for ending her pregnancy hardly 
impress even her. 
</P>
<P>
What we're really in for is some solid-gold comedy writing, at least in the 
first act. Radano has a flair for pulling the unexpected twist of a phrase out 
of a character naturally and effortlessly. What she doesn't have is a finished 
play. 
</P>
<P>
There's not a flaw in the first act, which ends with Sonny's discovering the 
secret, but Act II, though it's full of delightful whimsy, hardly has the comic 
power of Act I and dissipates the original thrust by wandering off in odd 
tangents. 
</P>
<P>
The cast, under Amy Glazer's purposefully frenetic direction, is super. 
Patricia Heaton as up-tight Tina, Marcy K. Ross as her wiser spinster sister 
and Michael A. Nickles as proud papa Sonny speak Radano's dialogue with 
unaffected sincerity, which is exactly what makes it hysterical. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Slater is a gentle delight as the whimsical Mr. Runey, whose advice might 
change Tina's mind, but Act II needs reconstruction and development before 
Runey looks as though he belongs in the play. Susan Ann Connor makes a brief 
appearance as an anti-abortion shill who tries to convince Tina how cute 
fetuses are. She is a tract in herself, but she's soon forgotten in the 
laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8142 West 3rd St.; Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m.; ends March 24. 
Tickets: $8-$10; (213) 466-1767. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen King's 'Rage': Thriller in Santa Monica 
</P>
<P>
When he was 19, guru of the grotesque Stephen King wrote a novella about a high 
school misfit who killed his teacher and held his class hostage at gunpoint in 
the classroom. Robert B. Parker ("Spenser: For Hire") and his wife Joan have 
adapted "Rage" for the stage, and it turns out to be a dandy little thriller, 
containing early indications of King's talent for lighting up the shadows 
inside the human subconscious. 
</P>
<P>
But this local premiere of the play, at Santa Monica Playhouse, barely meets 
King halfway. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Decker isn't alone in his rage. His student prisoners are torn by the 
same anger and most of them know what he's about. One, a nerd of a girl, is 
allowed to go to the restroom and, instead of escaping, returns to join in 
Charlie's "getting it on." Underneath, they're on his wavelength. 
</P>
<P>
Outside of Daniel Parker (the adapters' son) as Charlie, who has a deceivingly 
placid smile hiding twisted hatred, the cast barely looks closely at their 
characters, and the direction by Chris DeCarlo and Evelyn Rudie hasn't wound 
the tension tight enough to make the piece as threatening or gripping as it 
could be. James Cooper's lighting is as intricate and startling as the rest of 
the production should be. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1211 4th St., Santa Monica; Tuesdays and Wednesdays, 8 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 
p.m.; ends May 6. Tickets: $15; (213) 394-9779. 
</P>
<P>
Family Anger Surfaces in 'Vikings' at Powerhouse 
</P>
<P>
There's a lot of long-suffered anger behind the surface bonding of the three 
generations of Larsen men in Stephen Metcalfe's "Vikings." That's the strength 
of the play, the sharp edge under the Larsens' Nordic cool. 
</P>
<P>
Under the minimalist direction of Cedric Winchell at the Powerhouse, none of 
that tension comes through. Maybe it would through the close eye of a camera, 
but on stage it barely gets to the other side of the kitchen table where much 
of the action takes place -- never as far as the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Al Hansen makes the strongest impression as the grandfather, who's sage and 
often poetic even in the gnawing unfairness of his cancerous decline. As his 
son, still mourning his wife who also died of cancer, John Reger acts a lot but 
never gets under Peter's skin. 
</P>
<P>
The grandson, who should be angriest of them all while he's fighting for his 
own identity, is more Cleaver than Larsen in Eric Stromer's performance. Sachi 
Parker as the grandfather's nurse, who's had her eye on Peter since high 
school, matches Hansen's attempt to find some energy and intricacy in their 
scenes. 
</P>
<P>
Although Lisa Thompson's costumes are fine, Sharon Rosen's lighting and Gary 
Cotter's setting are as minimal as Winchell's direction. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3116 2nd St., Santa Monica; Thursdays through Sundays, 8 p.m.; ends March 
18. Tickets: $15; (213) 466-1767. 
</P>
<P>
'Hollywood Follies' Lacks Nostalgic Touch 
</P>
<P>
Why aren't revues done much these days? Maybe because the mind-set that created 
the form and made revues a popular theatrical staple of the 1920s through 1940s 
has disappeared. It's a specialized idiom. David Man hasn't brought back any of 
the magic in his "Hollywood Follies" at the Victory Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
There are some pleasant songs (Man wrote the lyrics, music variously by Stanley 
D. Hoffman, Michael Urbaniak, Aaron Egigian and Robert Bendorff), such as the 
lilting "The Good Stuff," and some clever comedy bits, such as Jennifer Butt's 
brittle, acerbic casting director in a running gag. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the material is old hat (a Polish tango teacher in a black cape) 
and some of it is in bad taste, including comic references to Katharine 
Hepburn's affliction, Judy Garland's sad decline and Peggy Lee's medication. 
The latter unfortunately emerges in one of the show's funnier numbers, a 
send-up of a somnambulant Lee and a raspingly vicious Yma Sumac. 
</P>
<P>
Man still thinks male transvestism is good for a few laughs, and homosexual 
leading men in Hollywood a hoot, and imagines Michael Jackson's plastic surgery 
turning him into -- are you ready? -- Diana Ross. 
</P>
<P>
There are good performances, topped by Marion Ramsey and Peter Marc, 
particularly in the comic and sultry "Born Blonde," but the ensemble doesn't 
really have much to work with. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3326 Victory Blvd., Burbank; Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 
7 p.m.; indefinitely. Tickets: $15-$17; (818) 841-5421.

'MORANT' SNAPS TO ATTENTION AT ART THEATRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The court-martial drama, "Breaker Morant," was an Australian play before it was 
a movie, and the stage version is making an auspicious L.A. debut at the Los 
Angeles Art Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the play was seen locally last winter -- CalRep in Long Beach had the 
U.S. premiere. That was a strong show, and this production is equally arresting 
and for essentially the same reasons: The texture is lean and hard and the 
action is vocally punctuated like riffs from a snare drum. 
</P>
<P>
Australian playwright Kenneth Ross' true-life story, set in 1902 South Africa, 
is about a trio of bush-ravaged Aussie soldiers who are tried by hypocritical 
British forces for murdering Boer prisoners of war. 
</P>
<P>
The production crackles under John Hertzler's visceral direction (not to 
mention his flinty, musty set design). This is a show of barrel-chested gusto. 
The actors playing the three defendants are Aussies, and many of the voices in 
the 15-member cast ripple in the air and certainly carry. This is significant. 
You seldom hear distinguished diction on L.A.'s stages. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, the weak vocal link is Robert Bruce in the searing role of 
horseman/soldier/poet Breaker Morant. Bruce too often mushes and swallows his 
words. He's also a touch long in the tooth for the fiery Bushveldt Carbineer. 
</P>
<P>
But, as producer, he cast the show with pearls. Steffen Gregory Foster's 
earnest defense counsel is heartfelt, Peter Lindsay's physically imposing 
soldier-on-trial is dynamic. David Grant Hayward's arch, smirky aide to Lord 
Kitchener is deliciously pompous, and Granville Ames plays a poised, silky 
witness who reminds you of Robert Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike CalRep's off-stage military execution, here we see the craven act, see 
sparks flare from the fired blanks and freeze on the tumbling bodies. You may 
flinch but the production doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
The play was originally performed by the Melbourne Theatre Company in 1978. The 
film followed the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 At 11305 Magnolia Blvd., North Hollywood, Fridays, Saturdays, 8 p.m., and 
Sundays, 7 p.m., through April 15. Tickets: $17.50. (818) 763-3101.

THE GALLERIES: WILSHIRE CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Worthy Figure: Werner Drewes -- a student at both the Weimar and Dessau 
Bauhaus schools who emigrated to the United States in 1930 -- was something of 
a jack-of-all-trades in art. Intrigued by color relationships, he studied 
stained-glass design as a young man. 
</P>
<P>
During his long career (he died in 1985), Drewes produced paintings, 
watercolors, etchings, color woodcuts, lithographs and collages. An exhibit of 
152 works dating mostly from the '40s and '70s introduces a worthy secondary 
figure on the American scene. 
</P>
<P>
Not an innovator, Drewes nonetheless had a rhythmic feel for geometric 
patterning, a fine eye for color and a knack for concocting tiny, drolly 
meaningful collages. He was also a deft portraitist: a group of woodcuts 
demonstrates distinctly different techniques for conveying the spirit of each 
sitter. Although he doesn't appear to have updated his stylistic approach 
noticeably after the early '50s, many works of his middle and old age display 
the ease and lightness of careless youth. 
</P>
<P>
In "Aquatic Ballet," a color woodcut from 1979, a medley of fanciful purple and 
orange shapes bob in close-knit ranks, with color laid over color to yield a 
porous effect. Posing plumply in an airy, turquoise-and-yellow celloprint from 
1952, nude Nausikaa (who rescued shipwrecked Odysseus in Homer's "Odyssey") 
looks in need of a proper New Yorker cartoon punch line. In "Satellites," a 
painting from 1984, Drewes combines soft, bright color, simple geometry -- and 
the same penchant for tight construction that, 40 years earlier, led him to 
reorganize a "View of the Bay" into a warren of small compartments holding 
sailboats and rocks. (Tobey C. Moss Gallery, 7321 Beverly Blvd., to March 31.)

HOME TECH / WHAT'S NEW IN VIDEO: SONY SPONSORS 'VISIONS OF U.S.' COMPETITION

ABC's "America's Funniest Home Videos" isn't the only place you can send those 
camcorder productions you're so proud of. If you have something considerably 
more ambitious than a shot of junior accidentally hitting Dad in the groin with 
a baseball (ever notice how much of the "funny" stuff in that show is based on 
pain?), then you might like to submit it to the sixth annual "Visions of U.S." 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by Sony and administered by the American Film Institute, the 
competition welcomes entries from people who are able to "communicate their 
self-expression and personal vision in this new medium." Tapes are being 
accepted in four categories -- fiction, nonfiction, experimental and music 
video. A "Young People's Merit Award" will recognize video makers under the age 
of 18. 
</P>
<P>
Judging the tapes (more than 600 were received last year) will be film 
directors Jonathan Demme, Amy Jones and Jerry Kramer, producer Karen Murphy, 
actors LeVar Burton, Willem Dafoe and Tim Robbins, and Rolling Stone editor 
Jeffrey Ressner. All entries must be produced and submitted on half-inch VHS or 
Beta, or 8mm cassettes, and can run no longer than a half-hour. 
</P>
<P>
The grand-prize winner will get a new top-of-the-line Sony Video 8 camcorder. 
First through third prize in each category is a Sony home-video system. 
Deadline: June 15. 
</P>
<P>
Information: (213) 856-7743.

THIS WEEK'S MOVIES 
</P>
<P>
Since you may only be able to dream about professional baseball this spring, 
maybe renting "Field of Dreams" (MCA, no suggested retail price, MPAA-rated PG) 
will help stir your imagination. On the other hand, you might be better off 
playing computer baseball.

This fantasy concerns a farmer (Kevin Costner) who obeys a mysterious voice, 
builds a baseball field and winds up with the spirit of banned-from-the-game 
Shoeless Joe Jackson on his hands (and coming out of the ozone using a 
different arm than in the 1910s). 
</P>
<P>
The would-be Capra-esque concoction -- also starring Amy Madigan, James Earl 
Jones and Burt Lancaster -- hit a home run with most critics and a lot of 
theater patrons last year. It was also nominated for an Academy Award as best 
picture of the year. But "Bull Durham," also starring Costner and available on 
tape, is an infinitely better and truer film about the national pastime.

Other 1989 movies out this week on video: "Romero" (Vidmark, $89.95, PG-13), 
"Shocker" (MCA, no suggested retail price, R), "Phantom of the Opera" (horror

HOME TECH / CD CORNER: COLUMBIA'S 'JOHNNIE RAY' SHORT BUT SWEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At just under 24 minutes, "The Best of Johnnie Ray" must be one of the shortest 
compact discs in existence. 
</P>
<P>
But the key tunes in the nine-song Columbia Records collection showcase the 
contributions of a man whose place in rock history has been greatly 
under-appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
Ray served as a small yet significant bridge between the smooth, generally 
formal pop style of the '40s and the more intense and informal approach that 
would characterize the late-'50s rock revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Ray, who died Feb. 24 in Los Angeles of liver failure at age 63, worked in a 
mostly conventional pop framework on record in the early '50s, but he applied 
such strong rhythm &amp; blues instincts on such Columbia Records hits as "Cry" 
and "The Little White Cloud That Cried" that the singles sounded revolutionary 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Though Ray's records mostly sound dated now because of the timid, pop-framed 
musical backings, you can hear in his vocal interpretation the soulful drama 
and abandon that would become a fixture in modern pop music. 
</P>
<P>
It was ironic then that the arrival of rock in 1956 meant the end of Ray's 
reign as a major record seller. Where he had 13 Top 20 hits before 1956, he 
only had two after that pivotal year. 
</P>
<P>
Even if he had been a rebel in the earlier pop world, Ray was rejected by the 
new teen rock crowd as someone who belonged to a different era. The emphasis 
was on the new and the young, and Ray -- who was 29 when Elvis Presley's 
"Heartbreak Hotel" entered the sales charts -- just didn't fit.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: CHAYA IN VENICE FEATURES A DIFFERENT LOOK AND MENU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"And thank you for your continuous support," reads the last line. 
</P>
<P>
No, it's not another new line of alcoholic pop. It is the elegant announcement 
of the equally elegant Chaya Venice, 110 Navy St., Venice, (213) 396-1179, 
which opened last week near the corner of Main and Rose streets. 
</P>
<P>
This spacious new Chaya looks different than its siblings, trendy Chaya 
Brasserie (meeting place of agents and actors) and tiny Chaya Diner (where the 
hip pinch pennies). It's got a different menu too: You'll find Chaya's 
signature cross-cultural mix 
</P>
<P>
with its elements of Italy, Japan and California, but here the emphasis is on 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
I tried a seaweed salad sprinkled with tiny fried fish and a rather wonderful 
concoction consisting of shrimp-stuffed jalapenos that were deep-fried and 
served with guacamole. My favorite entree was crispy catfish in mustard sauce; 
my least favorite was a sort of sweet soup called "fish chili." 
</P>
<P>
The wine list here, as at Chaya Brasserie, is innovative, well-priced and 
doesn't contain a single alcoholic pop. RUTH REICHL

ETHNIC EATING: GETTING CHUMMY WITH OK-DOL KOREAN B.B.Q. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Part of my wardrobe is now perfumed with the aroma of grilled meat, the 
consequence of eating at Ok-Dol Korean B.B.Q. This restaurant is very small and 
when the table grills are fired up, smoke and sizzle dominate the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Here you can grill not only the usual beef, pork and chicken but also pork 
belly, beef heart and tongue. Order belly and you get large, thick, fatty 
slices that look like bacon. The slices come to the table frozen. On the grill, 
they do a sort of vanishing act. Bigger pieces shrink to crunchy little tidbits 
and taste best folded in a lettuce leaf along with a dab of hot bean paste. You 
also get a bowl of sesame oil and salt for dipping. 
</P>
<P>
Order certain combinations of meat -- say, beef rib eye and chicken -- and the 
waitress may frown. This doesn't mean that you have committed some culinary 
infraction. The meats simply require different grills. Rib eye and pork belly 
cook on a solid grill. Chicken, pork meat and beef ribs take a perforated 
grill. The solution? You cook one meat at the table while the other is grilled 
in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Barbecue is Ok-Dol's specialty, but I also tried such things as broiled 
corvina, blue crab soup, kimchi soup and rice in a stone pot. The corvina -- a 
whole fish -- was crisp, plain and pleasant, in contrast to the spiciness that 
dominates a meal here. If you order steamed corvina, you get fish covered with 
what looks like very hot sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with the crab soup was extracting the meat from the shell. It's a 
messy job and you wind up with barely a taste. The spicy broth was good, 
though, and contained enough vegetables and tofu to make up for the scanty 
amount of crab. 
</P>
<P>
Kimchi soup is just what it sounds like -- hotly seasoned red broth full of 
cabbage. The addition of tofu turns it into a well-rounded, robust main dish. 
Stone-pot rice is the Korean bibim bap, a mixture of rice, vegetables, meat and 
seaweed topped with a raw egg yolk to stir into the mixture. The heavy black 
pot is hot enough to cook the egg. 
</P>
<P>
A meal here has so many components that it may be impossible to get them all on 
the small tables. In addition to platters of meat for grilling and any extra 
courses such as soup or fish that you may order, there will be bowls of clear 
beef broth, plain white rice and a salad composed of lettuce and long shreds of 
green onion, flecked red with chile. You must also make room for 10 bowls of 
the little "relishes" that traditionally accompany Korean meals. These include 
such nibbles as marinated bean sprouts, kimchi, seasoned eggplant, cucumber, a 
bland gray-white translucent slice of something the waitress called Korean 
"Jell-O" and Korean "pizza" (a soft pastry dotted with red and green 
vegetables). 
</P>
<P>
Prices are a little lower than at some Korean restaurants. Barbecued pork, 
which is excellent and very spicy here, is $9.50 on the dinner menu, and the 
price includes the soup, rice, salad and collection of relishes. Chicken is 
also $9.50, and beef dishes are $10.50. Ok-Dol also has a weekday lunch special 
in which the price of barbecued beef, chicken or pork drops to $5.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Ok-Dol Korean B.B.Q., 698 S. Vermont Ave., Los Angeles. (213) 385-1802. Open 
daily from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. MasterCard and Visa accepted. Parking available.

BOY AIDS IN ARREST; SCHOOL DRUG PROGRAM CITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE YASUDA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last year, when National City police officers began teaching the DARE program 
in schools, they expressed simple hopes for the acclaimed drug-use prevention 
class: help a few youngsters say no to drugs. 
</P>
<P>
But on Thursday afternoon, the officers' wildest expectations for the program 
were surpassed when a 9-year-old boy, enrolled in a Drug Abuse Resistance 
Educationclass at Central Elementary, helped arrest a man in possession of what 
appeared to be methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
Jorge Benitez, 19, of San Diego was arrested on suspicion of possession of a 
controlled substance, possession for sale, transportation of a controlled 
substance and being under the influence of a controlled substance, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy was running an errand for his mother, police said, when he walked 
through a carwash and saw Benitez, sitting in a pickup truck, using a razor 
blade to line up white powder across a mirror. 
</P>
<P>
"He went over to a pay phone and called us on 911 and told us he was a DARE 
student," said Officer David Grande, who arrested Benitez. "He gave us the 
license plate number and a description of the truck and said he would stay 
there until we came over. I was surprised and impressed." 
</P>
<P>
When Grande arrived at the carwash at 234 Highland Ave. shortly after 4 p.m., 
he found Benitez. A search of the pickup truck uncovered 0.25 of a gram of 
methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
The boy will receive a commendation from Police Chief Stan Knee. 
</P>
<P>
"Not too many people want to get involved. . . . Sure, occasionally someone may 
make a call, but then they leave and want no part of it," Grande said. "But 
this young boy knew that what the man was doing was wrong and he wanted to make 
sure he got arrested.

UCLA'S BUBBLE TO BURST?; 
</P>
<P>
PACIFIC 10: OTHER COACHES SAY BRUINS NEED A GOOD SHOWING TO REACH NCAA 
TOURNAMENT, BUT HARRICK DISAGREES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

TEMPE, Ariz. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA's hopes of securing an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament could be 
greatly affected today when the Bruins play Oregon in the quarterfinals of the 
Pacific 10 Conference tournament at Arizona State's University Activity Center. 
</P>
<P>
A loss would send the Bruins home with an 18-10 record -- and possibly without 
a bid. 
</P>
<P>
"They need to come through the first round and maybe even the second round," 
Arizona Coach Lute Olson said of the Bruins, who ended the regular season by 
losing six of 10 games. "They're definitely a team that's on the bubble." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA finished fourth in the Pac-10, dropping six of its last nine conference 
games after ending the first half of the conference race tied for the lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins defeated both Arizona and Oregon State, the Pac-10 co-champions, in 
January at Pauley Pavilion but lost to those teams last month on the road. They 
beat California at Berkeley in January -- their only victory on the road 
against a winning team -- but lost to the Golden Bears last month in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, since Jan. 24, when they beat Oregon State, 94-80, the Bruins have 
beaten only one winning team -- DePaul, which is 17-14. And in the second half 
of the conference race, UCLA beat only Arizona State, Washington and Washington 
State, which were seeded eighth, ninth and 10th in the Pac-10 tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Their five-game losing streak last month was their longest in 42 years, and 
they lost at Pauley Pavilion for the first time to both Stanford and Cal. 
</P>
<P>
They were 4-6 against the top six teams in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
"UCLA could be in jeopardy," Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery said. "I hate to 
say that because I think they deserve to go, but they're such a visible program 
-- everybody watches them so closely, with their national TV games and so forth 
-- that some of their recent struggles might hurt them. 
</P>
<P>
"They're going to need to show some improvement -- maybe get to the final (this 
weekend). They would have to beat Oregon State (in the semifinals) and make a 
good showing against Arizona (in the final). They lost five straight games. 
They won their last two, but against the (bottom two) teams in our conference 
-- and they did not dominate them." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA defeated Washington State, 96-89, and Washington, 74-61, in its last two 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the Bruins lost to Oregon, 105-99, at Eugene, Ore., giving up 
more points than they had ever allowed a conference opponent in regulation 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore guard Terrell Brandon scored a season-high 31 points, junior guard 
Kevin Mixon scored a season-high 25 points and forward Keith Reynolds scored 24 
points for the Ducks, who made a season-high 65% of their shots. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in their face a lot of times," UCLA Coach Jim Harrick said afterward, 
"but they just shot the ball awfully well." 
</P>
<P>
When Harrick's comment was relayed to a Bruin player, however, the player 
laughed, indicating that UCLA's effort was less than total. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Don Monson of Oregon expects to see a more intense Bruin team today at 
the 1 p.m. (PST) tip-off. 
</P>
<P>
"They know pretty much that they can't get beat by Oregon and still go to the 
NCAAs," said Monson, whose Ducks are 15-12 and hoping to land a bid to the 
National Invitation Tournament. "They will be focused and coming at us with 
both barrels." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the Bruins believe that when the pairings for the NCAA tournament are 
announced Sunday at 3:30 p.m., PST, their name will be called, regardless of 
what happens this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"I think 18-10 would be good enough to get us in," Harrick said. "We're the 
only team in our conference that beat Arizona and Oregon State. Every team we 
lost to, except USC, will play in a postseason tournament." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA defeated one team that has already earned a berth in the NCAA tournament 
-- East Tennessee State -- and beat three others that are expected to land bids 
-- Arizona, Oregon State and Cal. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Harrick said, the selection committee will take into account that UCLA's 
nose-dive last month coincided with forward Trevor Wilson's wrist injury, which 
seems to have healed. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe the reason we lost some games we shouldn't have is because we had a guy 
hurt and he's back playing now," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Wilson didn't miss any games. But after averaging 19.1 points and 9.1 
rebounds in UCLA's first 17 games, he has averaged 13.2 points and 8.7 rebounds 
since spraining his right wrist against USC on Feb. 1, and has made only 21 of 
60 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
In UCLA's past three games, however, Wilson has taken 38 rebounds. "With the 
way my wrist is now," Wilson said, "I can play pretty much the same kind of 
basketball I played earlier. It's just a matter of getting back into the flow 
of things." 
</P>
<P>
The pain, he said, is limited. 
</P>
<P>
Not limited are the Bruins' chances of making the NCAA tournament, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel any pressure whatsoever," said Wilson when asked if today's game 
represented a do-or-die situation for the Bruins. "I feel very confident that 
we'll win. And with the talent we have, and if we play right, we should win the 
whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
If they did that, of course, they would take the decision out of the hands of 
the selection committee. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins would earn the automatic berth that goes to the Pac-10 tournament 
champion.

CBS WILL PAY $1 BILLION-PLUS FOR NFC PACKAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Another piece of the NFL television contract puzzle fell into place Thursday 
when CBS announced that it will pay slightly more than $1 billion for the 
rights to Sunday afternoon NFC games and NFC playoff games during the next four 
seasons, plus the 1992 Super Bowl in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
CBS' acquisition of the '92 Super Bowl means a change in the rotation. Under 
the old format, NBC would have televised that game and CBS the '93 game. ABC 
earlier acquired the rights to the '91 Super Bowl next January in Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
The question now is, which network will televise the '94 Super Bowl, the final 
one covered in the four years of this contract? 
</P>
<P>
NBC's part of the contract may be announced today or early next week. It has 
been predicted that NBC would pay $700 to $800 million for the AFC package and 
one Super Bowl -- the '93 game, which the Rose Bowl is seeking to stage. 
</P>
<P>
But the change in rotation could mean NBC will get two consecutive Super Bowls, 
in both '93 and '94, and end up paying close to $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
That would make the total television revenue nearly $4 billion, or about $35 
million per team per year, which is more than double the amount under the old 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
A more likely possibility, according to one source, is that the NFL will simply 
award the '94 game to the highest bidder, which might include Turner or ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
Cable is able to pay a higher price because it can pass the cost along to 
subscribers, while the major networks have to depend solely on sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
Turner and ESPN combined have agreed to pay $900 million to the NFL for Sunday 
night games. 
</P>
<P>
In comparison, ABC is getting a lot more for its money -- Monday night games, a 
considerably more valuable commodity, plus first-round playoff games and a 
Super Bowl -- for $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
CBS' $1-billion package is just one of a series of recent big-money deals for 
that network. Others include $1.06 billion for four years of baseball, $1 
billion for seven years of the NCAA basketball tournament and $543 million for 
the next two Winter Olympics.

transfer from the University of Stuttgart in West Germany, tops the college 
list with a jump of 26 feet 11 3/4 inches.

The NCAA Final Four shirts were piled high, unsold and seemingly unwanted, in 
the corner of the bookstore located in the basement of Duffy Hall. They were 
marked down, reduced, and still they remained on the shelves; hundreds of them, 
it seemed. "Seton Hall, NCAA Final Four," "Battle in Seattle" and "NCAA 
Championship Game, Seattle" they read. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why they don't get rid of these shirts," said Leslie Allen, an 
employee at the bookstore. "We don't sell any of them, I don't think. I've 
never seen anybody buying them, at least not since it turned 1990." 
</P>
<P>
"What about when the alumni were here?" one of the counter clerks, Ellen Davis, 
said. "What was that, about a week, no, two weeks ago?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
"How many did we sell then?" Davis said. "We sell a lot?" 
</P>
<P>
"One, I think," Allen said. "Two, at most. It's not like we have to go and 
stock them back up all the time. I don't know why they just don't throw them 
all out. I think the problem is (the team is) losing all the time. Doesn't that 
team ever win anymore?" 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to Seton Hall University, 1990, less than one year after the Pirates 
took the campus, and a nation, by storm. They had begun the '88-89 season 
picked seventh in the Big East and finished it with an 80-79 overtime loss to 
Michigan in the NCAA Championship Game in Seattle. This year, Seton Hall comes 
to the Big East Tournament as just another also-ran. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates (12-15) just missed making an appearance in Thursday night's 
dreaded last-place game when they beat St. John's Saturday in the 
regular-season finale. Still, Seton Hall holds faint hope it will find a way to 
sweep through the tournament, thus earning an automatic bid to the NCAA 
Tournament. Friday at Madison Square Garden, the Pirates play a first-round 
game against this year's dark horse -- eighth-ranked and second-seeded 
Connecticut. Anything less than a Big East Tournament title and the Pirates 
will be without a postseason berth -- either NCAA or National Invitation 
Tournament -- for the first time in four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been difficult," said Coach P.J. Carlesimo, the two-time Big East coach 
of the year who just last April threw out the first ball of the season at 
Yankee Stadium and was offered a job as coach of Kentucky in the same week. 
"But this is inevitable. It's a different team from that one; there are so many 
new kids and different expectations. We didn't know what our potential was, how 
good or bad we would be. I'm not saying we did a great job, but we do have nine 
first-year players, two of them walk-ons, and we have been competitive, been 
entertaining for the most part. I still think this team is better than the NIT 
team we had three years ago. This team doesn't have the numbers to back it up, 
but this is a pretty good team." 
</P>
<P>
But not good enough. Where last season Seton Hall always seemed to find a way 
to win, this team, with five new starters -- has been the opposite, losing 10 
of 16 games decided by fewer than 10 points, six of those by five points or 
fewer. In February, Seton Hall lost six of seven games, although all but one -- 
a 78-65 loss at Boston College -- were to ranked teams. This season, the 
Pirates have fallen to Oklahoma (89-84) and North Carolina State (65-62), to 
Syracuse (74-65 and 71-69), St. John's (90-81, OT) and, yes, also to Michigan 
(91-86). 
</P>
<P>
"It's been very tough," swingman Michael Cooper, one of only two scholarship 
seniors on the team, said last week after the Pirates had fallen to Syracuse on 
a last-second tip-in by Derrick Coleman. "It hasn't really sunk in yet what has 
happened this season; that come the tournament, our next loss will be our last 
game. The toughest part is we've been right there. We've played all the 
top-ranked teams in the nation on national television and we're right there all 
the time. But we can't seem to grab it." 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall is led by freshman guard Terry Dehere, who has averaged 16.5 points, 
3.4 assists and 2.1 rebounds, but who has been pressing of late -- his shooting 
percentage is down to 39.1 percent in the league after a brilliant early-season 
stretch. Cooper, meanwhile, has been the most consistent player on a team that 
has been erratic at best. He has averaged 13.6 points and 6.3 rebounds and shot 
57 percent from the field. The Pirates have been plagued by the sporadic inside 
play of Frantz Volcy, a 6-8 senior who has averaged 12.2 points, 6.5 rebounds 
and 3.9 fouls per game. Center Anthony Avent has been a solid rebounder with 
9.3 per game, but has not produced much offense -- he has averaged 10.7 points 
-- and has also averaged 3.9 fouls per game. The Hall has lacked depth and a 
true point guard who can run the offense. It has won some games and remained 
close in others mainly because of aggressive man-to-man defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we went into the Big East Tournament knowing that no matter what 
happened we were going somewhere in the NCAA Tournament," Volcy said. "Now, all 
that has changed. We know we can beat these teams; know we've been so close. 
But we also know it's do-or-die." 
</P>
<P>
That desperation, it seems, is reflected on campus. Where last year there were 
parties, parades and celebrations for a team that captured both the heart and 
imagination of the community, now, it seems, there is little interest. 
</P>
<P>
"See Your Pirates Versus Syracuse, 7 P.M. In The Game Room," read the sign 
outside the Bishop Dougherty Student Center one day last week. And below, 
"Confessions all day in chapel." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like it was last year," said Kim Lecardo, a sophomore working the 
information desk in the student center who said a crowd of about "20 to 25" was 
expected for the telecast that night. "People on campus just don't care that 
much about the team now." 
</P>
<P>
Which, perhaps, is why so many of those shirts still remain on sale at the 
bookstore in Duffy Hall. "You know," Cooper said, "I don't think they sell many 
of those shirts, but it's probably because of the price." Maybe, it's because 
they only serve as a reminder of how far the team has fallen.

PITT ENSURES BOSTON COLLEGE'S SHORT STAY; 
</P>
<P>
BIG EAST: PANTHERS ROLL IN TOURNAMENT ELIMINATION GAME AND EARN RIGHT TO FACE 
SYRACUSE IN TODAY'S QUARTERFINALS.

When the Big East tournament resumes today it will do so without ninth-seeded 
Boston College, which played its elimination game Thursday night against 
Pittsburgh as if the team bus was warmed, ready and conveniently parked near a 
Madison Square Garden exit door. 
</P>
<P>
This was a team in search of an off-season, not a victory. The Eagles began the 
year with one conference victory, and they ended it that way, too, losing, 
88-70, to a Pittsburgh team considered a dangerous underachiever. 
</P>
<P>
"We're done," said Boston College Coach Jim O'Brien, as he dashed into the 
chilly New York night. "And to be perfectly frank with you, I'm sure the kids 
are happy it's over. Praise the Lord, see you later." 
</P>
<P>
But before he left, O'Brien warned Syracuse -- Pitt's quarterfinal opponent 
today -- and the rest of the Big East not to overlook the Panthers. And with 
good reason. 
</P>
<P>
Pitt's starting lineup includes four players with double-digit scoring averages 
and another just two-tenths away. The Panthers finished first in the conference 
in three-point percentage, second in scoring, third in free-throw percentage 
and third in field goal percentage, which makes you wonder how they ended the 
regular season 11-16 and 5-11 in the Big East. 
</P>
<P>
"People will make a mistake if they underrate them," O'Brien said. "If they 
don't get tired in four games, I think they can (win) it." 
</P>
<P>
Pitt will need performances like those delivered Thursday night by guard Jason 
Matthews, formerly of St. Monica High, and forward Brian Shorter, recently 
named to his second consecutive all-Big East team. Matthews scored a 
season-high 32 points, 24 in the second half. Shorter added 18 points and 11 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"We know we need to fight like dogs," Matthews said. 
</P>
<P>
As opposed to playing like them, which is what Pitt did for most of the season. 
Picked to finish third in most Big East preseason polls, the Panthers dived 
deep into the conference standings and never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this helped us," Evans said. "We needed for our kids to get some 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Five Pitt players reached double figures against Boston College, which played 
without leading scorer Doug Able, who was back in Boston with a suspected case 
of mononucleosis. Also ailing was Eagle starting center David Hinton, who 
scored 12 points while suffering from flu and an injured elbow. 
</P>
<P>
It probably wouldn't have mattered. In their previous two meetings this season, 
Pitt won by an average of 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
Now on to the quarterfinals, where Pitt faces No. 1-seeded Syracuse, which 
swept the Panthers this year. Pitt blew a late lead in the first game and lost 
by two points and then was beaten by nine at Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
Also scheduled for today are games between Connecticut and Seton Hall, followed 
by Georgetown and Providence and St. John's and Villanova.

Defending Iditarod champion Joe Runyan was the first to reach Ophir, Alaska, 
after a moose knocked four-time winner Rick Swenson out of the lead in the 
Alaskan dog-sled races. 
</P>
<P>
Runyan reached Ophir, a Gold Rush-era ghost town on the Innoko River 476 miles 
from Anchorage, 36 minutes ahead of Lavon Barve and 44 minutes ahead of Martin 
Buser. 
</P>
<P>
Swenson had left McGrath, a checkpoint 61 miles back on the trail, several 
hours before the others but turned around after a run-in with the moose, which 
trampled some of his dogs. 
</P>

A sled dog injured in the encounter was checked by a veterinarian who 
pronounced it fit to go on.

his old mark of 283-2. His record may not be recognized, however, because South

UNION BANK WINS $5 MILLION IN SUIT AGAINST AUDITOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Orange County Superior Court jury Thursday ordered the accounting firm of 
Arthur Young &amp; Co. to pay $5 million to Union Bank of San Francisco for 
negligence in preparing financial statements on a small Los Angeles company. 
</P>
<P>
Bank officials testified at the Santa Ana trial that they depended on the 
accountants' financial statements when loaning about $10 million to Small World 
Greetings, a gift company that later went bankrupt. The bank was seeking to 
recover $6.7 million it said it was still owed. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for Arthur Young said the jury, which deliberated for five days, also 
faulted the bank for what he called "its own ineptness" in making the loans. 
The accounting firm said it would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was watched closely by both the banking and accounting industries. 
With massive insolvencies in the thrift and banking industries, several major 
suits recently have been brought against accounting firms for failing to detect 
and report financial troubles of shaky institutions. 
</P>
<P>
In its lawsuit, Union Bank accused accountants in the Orange County and 
Pasadena offices of Arthur Young of negligence in preparing the financial 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
(The firm is now called Ernst &amp; Young after a 1989 merger with another big 
national firm, Ernst &amp; Whinney.) 
</P>
<P>
Based on the financial statements, Union Bank said it lent $5 million to Small 
World Greetings in May, 1985, and another $5 million within the next year. The 
company filed for bankruptcy in October, 1987. Arthur Young audited the company 
in 1983, 1984 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
During the seven-week trial, Union Bank accused the accountants of 
overestimating the value of Small World's inventory, one of the biggest items 
on its balance sheet. It also said the auditor's opinion at the end of the 
statement should have been a "limited" opinion, which indicates doubt about 
some of the figures in the statement, rather than the "unqualified" opinion 
Arthur Young appended. And a lawyer for the bank said the auditors -- some of 
whom still work for Arthur Young -- "got too close" to and "too involved" with 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
The financial statements, in short, "didn't suggest a business going under in 
any way, shape or form," said Bruce L. Simon, a Burlingame, Calif., lawyer who 
represented the bank. 
</P>
<P>
But Arthur Young's lawyer said it was the bank's own sloppy lending practices, 
not the accounting firm, that was to blame. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense was twofold," said Gene Erbstoesser, a lawyer for the accounting 
firm. "We did good work, and we stand behind it. This bank screwed up. The jury 
agreed with the second statement, but unfortunately they didn't totally agree 
with the first." 
</P>
<P>
It's not uncommon for a small company with a seasonal business to go under 
quickly, Erbstoesser said. Small World made pencil cases and other 
back-to-school products such as stationery. When it went under in 1987, it was 
having its best sales year at $27 million. As for the overstated inventory, the 
accountants can only rely on the information the client gives them, Erbstoesser 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Young is also being sued by people who bought worthless bonds from 
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine, who say they were misled by inaccurate 
information prepared by the accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
And the accounting firm is being sued in Texas by the federal government for 
$560 million in the wake of the $1-billion collapse of Western Savings Assn. in 
Dallas, the largest such suit ever filed by the government against an auditor. 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. says the accounting firm should have 
recognized numerous irregularities in Western's books.

JAPAN TRIES GENTLER TACK TO CRACK POST-'92 EUROPE; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE: MITSUBISHI'S TIE-UP WITH DAIMLER-BENZ REFLECTS A STRATEGY OF 
ESTABLISHING JOINT VENTURES ON THE CONTINENT.

<P>
Faced with intensifying friction over trade and investment in the United 
States, Japan is casting a hungry eye on Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the 12 nations of the European Community unite as a single marketplace 
of 320 million consumers -- and Japanese manufacturers are determined to be in 
place to share the expanding economic pie. 
</P>
<P>
Yet fear of possible trade protectionism in a "fortress Europe" has motivated 
corporate strategists here to modify their traditional drive toward exports and 
acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
The approach to Europe is gentler. Rather than boldly pursuing corporate 
takeovers, Japanese companies are quietly obtaining minority shareholdings in 
European firms. Instead of buying the Eiffel Tower, they are securing 
beachheads in friendly territory -- and moving their production base inside the 
ramparts. 
</P>
<P>
The new tactic was demonstrated earlier this week when one of the world's 
mightiest industrial and financial conglomerates, the Mitsubishi family of 
companies, announced that it is negotiating a "cooperative relationship" with 
West Germany's giant Daimler-Benz group. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi officials would not comment on specific business plans. They did say 
the two groups would go beyond existing ties in the auto industry to cooperate 
in "high-growth industries such as aerospace, electronics and the service 
sector." 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, Mitsubishi disclaimed any intention of swapping technology in 
weapons research, though both groups include the largest defense contractors in 
their respective countries. That did not stop the Japanese news media from 
quivering with apprehension that Americans might fear a rebirth of the World 
War II Axis that aligned imperial Japan and Nazi Germany against the United 
States and its allies. 
</P>
<P>
But a sober examination of what is potentially at stake in the Mitsubishi-Benz 
alliance clearly points toward 1992, the year the barriers will drop in the 
Common Market -- and not back toward 1941, the year Japan attacked Pearl 
Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Motors, the third-largest Japanese car manufacturer, accounted for 
207,000 of the 1.7 million cars that Japan shipped to Europe last year. The 
company, which sells Mercedes Benzes through its distribution channels in 
Japan, is the only major Japanese auto maker without production facilities in 
the European Community. 
</P>
<P>
Rivals Nissan, Honda, Isuzu and Suzuki are already producing motor vehicles in 
Europe, echoing the trend toward production in the United States. Nissan built 
76,976 cars in Britain last year and 86,181 in Spain. Toyota is building a 
plant in Britain that will have the capacity to produce 200,000 cars a year. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi officials say they are studying the possibility of investing in an 
auto plant in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Electric, another core company in the group, whose top executives 
were involved in negotiations with Daimler-Benz officials in Singapore last 
weekend, is building a semiconductor plant in Alsdorf, West Germany, that will 
make 4-megabit DRAM memory chips. 
</P>
<P>
It follows Fujitsu and NEC, chip makers with plants in Britain. Hitachi is 
looking at Munich. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past several years there has been a phenomenal surge of Japanese 
investment in Europe -- more than 300 Japanese companies have set up plants. 
Cumulative Japanese direct investment in the EC as of last March 31 was more 
than $35 billion, nearly a third of it in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
The pace of the capital infusion has quickened dramatically: In the six-month 
period that ended last Sept. 30, Japan invested $7.3 billion in the EC, nearly 
double the amount in the same period in 1988. One dollar of every $4 Japan 
invests overseas now goes to Europe, while America's share is declining. 
</P>
<P>
The boom in European investment is no accident. A company that manufactures 
goods in one of the EC nations will apparently enjoy the free-trade atmosphere 
of post-1992 Europe, no matter what kind of protectionist barriers might be 
thrown up against Japanese imports. 
</P>
<P>
"Japanese are very concerned about the possibility of a fortress Europe 
developing," said Peter Morgan, senior economist for the Barclays de Zoete Wedd 
investment bank in Tokyo. "They're looking for a way to be inside." 
</P>
<P>
Particularly, auto makers are attempting to make peace with their European 
competitors in order to assuage fears that Japan might try to dominate the 
industry once import quotas are relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
"They're trying to develop cooperative ties -- as opposed to adversarial 
relationships -- with European car manufacturers," Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, however, the bottom line for the Japanese firms may continue to 
reflect a fixation on market share, whether the goods are made locally in 
Europe or imported from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese are approaching Europe with market share in mind," Morgan said. 
"They don't know exactly who they're going to displace, but they're going to 
displace somebody." 
</P>
<P>
A fierce debate is now raging in the EC over how to define a Japanese car and 
how to deal with imports when the time comes. Five of the EC's 12 countries now 
impose some sort of quota or market restriction on auto imports from Japan, but 
this practice will become illegal after national markets are merged. The EC 
Commission has proposed phasing out the quotas over a period of several years. 
</P>
<P>
France and Italy are leading the fight to keep the quotas in place as long as 
possible and to include locally produced Japanese cars in the total. Britain 
and West Germany advocate a completely liberalized auto market. 
</P>
<P>
"Our group welcomes Japanese manufacturers entering Europe," Edzard Reuter, the 
Daimler-Benz AG chairman, told the newspaper Nihon Keizai late last year. "They 
will nourish EC markets with their vitality and create new jobs. Competition on 
the same ground can only lead to better products for consumers." 
</P>
<P>
EC ministers reportedly had a bitter clash when they met at the beginning of 
March to work out their differences on Japanese cars. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Japanese) strategy is to set up plants in Japan, Europe and America 
wherever they can and switch production so they can destroy U.S. and European 
auto makers," charged Edith Cresson, France's minister for European affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The French auto industry has taken the hard line that the Bluebird cars that 
Nissan produces in Britain are in fact "transplants" that should be counted as 
Japanese imports because so many of their components are Japanese in origin. 
Nissan contends that 71% of each car is local content. Peugeot charges that 
about half the car's parts come from Japan or elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"Those cars are not British," Cresson told reporters. "If we didn't have people 
in Europe who are a lot more Japanese than the Japanese, it would be a lot 
easier." 
</P>
<P>
The French may represent an extreme view but others are not far behind. 
</P>
<P>
A European diplomat in Tokyo said: "My sense is that public opinion toward 
Japan has tilted a bit in the hawkish direction. The fact that Americans are 
bashing Japan on trade, that rubs off on European attitudes. I'd expect a 
certain rise in temperature over the next while." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Europe has been spared the source of much contentiousness in the 
U.S.-Japan trade relationship: an incorrigible trade gap. Japan's trade surplus 
with the EC actually shrank by more than 13% last year to $19.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
But the Japanese seem unwilling to take any chances. A survey conducted by the 
Nihon Keizai of executives of 131 major corporations late last year suggested 
that Japan Inc. has "deep anxiety" about Europe. As many as 70% of all Japanese 
exporters are boosting investment in the EC "largely because they are scared 
that the integrated EC after 1992 might make harsher demands on Japan."

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / S. J. DIAMOND: INSURANCE FIGHT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By S. J. DIAMOND

<TEXT>
<P>
For a long time, rental car companies covered the cost of collision damage to 
many of their cars with money taken in on "collision damage waivers." Though 
many companies were self-insured for collision and the CDW for some years 
covered only a portion of car value, it was probably adequate. Indeed, there 
has always been some question of whether they covered such costs too well. 
</P>
<P>
There have been questions as well about whether rental companies misrepresented 
CDW coverage, selling it as "insurance" while insisting it wasn't to escape 
regulation, and whether they strong-armed customers into buying it when it may 
have duplicated coverage on their own auto policies. There were questions about 
advertising rates that didn't include or disclose fat CDW surcharges. There 
were even questions about repair costs -- most notably Hertz's -- that were 
billed to customers or their insurers and were found to be inflated. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, given all the questions, competition jumped in: Other businesses 
are now offering to cover those costs. But rental companies, far from being 
relieved, aren't happy. "Just try to get the money," they say, although they 
probably mean that they liked getting it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Many auto insurance policies now have collision coverage that's transferable to 
rented cars. Not everyone takes collision coverage, of course. But at State 
Farm, the nation's largest auto insurer, more than 77% do now: "More and more 
people are financing cars," says State Farm spokesman Bob Sasser in 
Bloomington, Ill., "and the lien-holder requires it." 
</P>
<P>
Credit card companies have also discovered collision damage, offering rental 
car coverage as an "enhancement" -- one of an increasing roster of added 
services to give their card an edge in today's competition. All American 
Express cards include the service and premium MasterCards and Visas -- not just 
to compete with other cards but with other payment options. "In spite of the 
growth of plastic," says Keith Kendrick, MasterCard's senior vice president of 
marketing, "less than 10% of all discretionary consumer income spending goes on 
bank cards rather than cash or checks." 
</P>
<P>
All credit cards together handle only 13% of consumer spending, according to 
the Santa Monica-based Nilson Report, which covers the industry. Obviously, 
offering convenience, credit and accounting records isn't enough, so they're 
offering care. MasterCard's first question to card-holders reporting rental car 
accidents is "Are you all right?," says Kendrick. If not, the company will "get 
involved in the process" of calling an ambulance or police or getting medical 
help. 
</P>
<P>
Sensitive to criticism of their own collision damage coverage, car rental 
agencies hasten to say that the coverage provided by credit card companies is 
no great deal, either. Application of the coverage is usually limited. It 
excludes exotic, antique and off-road vehicles, for instance, as well as 
long-term rentals (a 21-day limit for State Farm, 30 days for American Express, 
60 days for MasterCard). 
</P>
<P>
The effect of making a claim on one's auto insurance is the same as with one's 
own car: The premium goes up. Thus, a car rental agency can position its CDW, 
says Glenn Kurtz, an Enterprise Rent-A-Car agent in Beverly Hills, as "a 
service we offer to help them stay away from their insurance companies." 
</P>
<P>
What's more, a rental-company CDW lets customers just "walk away" from any 
collision damage, they say, while outside coverage involves a lot of paper 
work. Indeed, one must file claims. But given a copy of the rental company's 
bill for damage, a big insurer such as State Farm will deal with the company 
directly. Credit card companies send out claim forms to be returned with many 
documents attached -- copies of the rental contract, repair bill, accident 
report, auto insurance policy, notice of amount paid by insurance. 
</P>
<P>
This is secondary coverage, of course, paying what's left after any applicable 
auto insurance, or other responsible party, has paid off. They're also 
generally reimbursement plans, which means the customer may have to lay out 
money ahead -- for any deductible carried on his policy or for the whole amount 
if there's no policy -- sometimes before leaving the agency. 
</P>
<P>
Outside payers may also be stiff with rental companies, they say. Credit card 
companies may be very slow to pay and it takes one small independent rental 
agency in Hollywood "about four months" to get money from insurance companies. 
Indeed, insurers may be slower than usual and demand more information "to be 
sure we're not being ripped off," says Sasser at State Farm. The insurer has 
less control than with private cars, which come in for inspection, often with 
estimates; here, the rental company has the car and may already be fixing it. 
</P>
<P>
Such outside coverages don't guarantee rental companies satisfaction. Some 
agencies say most of their customers have no auto insurance, often because they 
don't own cars or are foreigners. They're also transient: This is a business 
serving "a lot of leisure travelers they never see again," says Jan Armstrong, 
director of the Washington-based American Car Rental Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Even when customers have outside coverage -- through insurance or a credit card 
-- it's "difficult (for rental agencies) to collect," says Armstrong. "Nobody 
ever hears from the customer again. They can go after the companies, but there 
may be no response." 
</P>
<P>
In their view, the only workable solution to such high risks is the CDW, which 
gives them revenue up front instead of a promise of later payment. But it's 
revenue, not money pooled to cover all damages or even to buy insurance. And 
pretending it was "insurance" just opened the door to the current complex 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
The whole squabble was avoidable. Rental car companies, like other businesses, 
should have bought insurance for their fleet and factored the cost of it into 
their rates. Auto insurers needn't have made their collision coverage 
transferable (building the cost into their rates), nor would credit card 
companies have offered the coverage (building the cost into their rates). 
Something relatively simple could have stayed simple, even straightforward, 
with car rental companies advertising honest daily rates that include insurance 
for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's not too late.

SUPPLY SIDE WAS SWEETEST DEAL FOR THE RICHEST 10% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The richest 1% of Americans are paying an average of $82,000 a year less in 
taxes today than they would have under the tax system in effect before the 
"supply side" revolution that began in 1978, according to a research study 
released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, all but the most affluent 10% of taxpayers are now paying higher 
federal taxes -- income and Social Security taxes combined -- despite Congress' 
efforts in the 1986 tax overhaul to reduce the burden on middle- and low-income 
persons. 
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared by the labor-sponsored Citizens for Tax Justice, is part 
of a campaign by congressional Democrats to highlight how tax burdens have 
shifted away from the very wealthy to the rest of the population. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time to reject this upside-down approach to tax policy and restore some 
real fairness to the federal tax system," said Robert S. McIntyre, the group's 
director. 
</P>
<P>
The report was embraced eagerly by House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt of 
Missouri, who heads a Democratic task force that is promoting a tax package 
aimed at providing some relief for middle-income voters. 
</P>
<P>
"The arrows of fairness are pointed in the wrong direction," Gephardt told a 
news conference at which the report was released. He charged that the White 
House is pushing a capital gains tax cut, which would largely benefit wealthy 
taxpayers, because Bush "believes the numbers are headed in the right direction 
and need another push." 
</P>
<P>
Many Democrats are also interested in proposing a tax hike for the 
highest-income Americans. But Gephardt said congressional Democratic leaders 
have not yet decided whether to endorse an income-tax increase on the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
The party's leadership in Congress is also looking for a way to roll back 
Social Security taxes, which have added more to the federal tax burden on 
middle- and lower-income Americans than income tax cuts have subtracted. Top 
Democrats are afraid, however, of a plan by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan 
(D-N.Y.) to cut Social Security taxes by $62 billion over the next two years 
because the proposal would dramatically widen the federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) is trying to fend off all efforts to cut taxes. 
Rostenkowski, who heads the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, is 
expected to argue in a series of public appearances over the next few days that 
some taxes should be raised. He is prepared to call for boosting the 28% tax 
rate on families with incomes above about $200,000 to 33% and to advocate an 
increase in gasoline and other excise taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Conservatives strongly dispute the Democratic argument on tax fairness. 
</P>
<P>
Sharply lower income tax rates for most Americans, with substantial tax cuts 
for the wealthy, were necessary to help revive economic growth, they argue. 
They point out that the rich, whose incomes grew substantially in the 1980s, 
pay considerably more in taxes today than they did 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"An influential minority of Democrats (are trying) to revive old fallacies 
about how income and wealth are shared, at the expense of constructive tax 
policies to ensure that both income and wealth continue to expand," argued Alan 
K. Reynolds, a well-known "supply side" economist at Polyconomics, a 
Morristown, N.J., consulting firm. Supply siders argue that lower taxes 
stimulate economic growth, which in turn raises overall tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
The Citizens for Tax Justice study said tax changes since 1977 are worth $93.1 
billion in savings this year to the richest 10% of Americans. By contrast, the 
remaining 90% are worse off by $25.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The study went back to 1978, when President Jimmy Carter was in office, because 
that was the year Congress first sharply cut the tax on capital gains, which 
are levied on profits from the sale of investments in stocks, bonds, real 
estate and other assets. Following President Ronald Reagan's election, 
lawmakers in 1981 approved a huge across-the-board income tax cut for both 
individuals and corporations. 
</P>
<P>
The 1986 tax overhaul partially reversed the trend toward granting tax cuts to 
the wealthy by eliminating a number of loopholes, the report noted. The result 
was to boost taxes by about $17 billion on the most affluent 5% while reducing 
income taxes somewhat for the bottom four-fifths of all families. 
</P>
<P>
Overall since 1977, the Citizens for Tax Justice report concluded, the pretax 
income of the lower 60% of American taxpayers, adjusted for inflation, has 
fallen by roughly 14%. Despite that decline, taxes on that group have increased 
by almost $19 billion. 
</P>
<P>
For the top 1% of all Americans, however, inflation-adjusted income has soared 
by 86% to an average of almost $549,000. Their inflation-adjusted federal tax 
burden has fallen by 15%, or $84 billion. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
Chart shows the percent change in inflation-adjusted family income, before and 
after taxes, between 1977 and 1990. For example, a family earning $30,960 has 
6% less pre-tax income in 1990 than it had in 1977 (in constant dollars) and 7% 
less after taxes.

9 CHARGED WITH HAVING HOT AVOCADOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA L. La GANGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You have to figure that any suspect charged with grand theft avocado is in deep 
guacamole, especially if he's arrested in the biggest avocado bust in recent 
California history. 
</P>
<P>
And that's exactly what happened in Temecula on Wednesday night. Nine suspects 
were arrested in an operation conducted by the Riverside County Sheriff's 
Department that netted 11,000 pounds of the green fruit allegedly stolen from 
nearby groves. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects were charged with breaking California Penal Code 487, the grand 
theft statute that covers agricultural products from algae to shellfish. If 
convicted, the men could face jail sentences of up to a year. 
</P>
<P>
"According to the information we have received, it's the biggest (bust) ever," 
said Avi Crane, director of industry affairs for the California Avocado 
Commission. "It's really amazing. . . . These guys, wow, they were 
sophisticated." 
</P>
<P>
Particularly in seasons when the crop is small and prices are high, avocados 
are the most commonly stolen agricultural product in California -- the state 
that produces 90% of the nation's avocados. California's crop is valued at $200 
million annually; theft is estimated at $10 million a year. The retail value of 
the stolen goods recovered Wednesday was about $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Four sheriff's deputies found the hot Haas on Wednesday when they raided two 
garages at a Temecula apartment building, said Deputy Sgt. Bill Walsh. 
Authorities had received a tip that avocados were being illegally stored, 
packed and shipped from the site. 
</P>
<P>
Five days of surveillance and two search warrants later, deputies "swooped down 
like Rodan" and raided the garages, Walsh said. What they found there was a 
central processing site; it was the agricultural equivalent of narcotics 
officers stumbling on a drug lab. "It looks like a majority of these thefts 
were committed by people who work in certain groves," Walsh said. "They were 
stealing from their employers and getting receipts from a packing house in 
Fallbrook. We're not sure if they were stolen, forged or legitimate." 
</P>
<P>
The receipts were important, said Bob Vice, president of the California Farm 
Bureau Federation, because Penal Code 487 makes it illegal to haul more than 40 
pounds of produce without a receipt, shipping permit or other proof of 
ownership. 
</P>
<P>
The thieves then allegedly packed the avocados in used boxes from legitimate 
growers, like the Calavo Growers of California. The boxes were stamped with 
California Food and Agriculture certification, so restaurants and markets 
believed that they were buying the fruit legally, Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd head up towards Los Angeles and sell them from Los Angeles to San 
Francisco," Walsh said. "These markets were under the impression that they were 
buying legitimate fruit. They were making these guys a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
The avocados were taken from groves in the Rancho California area, west of 
Temecula. On Wednesday night, it took three pickup trucks three hours to haul 
the fruit to a refrigerated warehouse. Once it is photographed, the fruit will 
be returned to its owners, a process that demands speed and sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to return them very quickly," Walsh said. "They're ripe 
and we can't dilly-dally. By the time this comes to trial, they'll be a 
steaming compost heap." 
</P>
<P>
So much for evidence.

GAF Settles Charges: GAF Corp. agreed to pay $1.25 million plus interest into a

James T. Sherwin, did not admit or deny allegations in the civil complaint. 
Sherwin and the company were to be sentenced today in New York for their 
conviction on criminal stock manipulation charges.

RYAN IN WINGS AS SAVINGS &amp; LOAN CZAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
T. Timothy Ryan Jr., a Washington lawyer and former key Labor Department 
official, will be nominated as the nation's top savings and loan regulator, 
according to Bush Administration sources. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan would become permanent director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, which 
oversees the S&amp;L industry beleaguered by the financial collapse of hundreds 
of insolvent institutions. 
</P>
<P>
"The agency needs strong leadership," said an Administration source. Although 
Ryan has no direct experience with S&amp;L regulation, he worked as solicitor 
of the Labor Department in the Reagan Administration from 1981 through 1983, 
handling litigation and important issues of regulatory policy and enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan "is a seasoned government veteran, tough and aggressive," an 
Administration source said. "We looked at a lot of different people for this 
job, and we feel he will provide important leadership and management skills." 
The Office of Thrift Supervision is "an agency that needs a change in direction 
after a rough period," according to the source. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan would be the permanent replacement for the controversial M. Danny Wall, 
who has resigned as the top thrift regulator. Wall came under considerable 
criticism from Congress for his management of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, 
the old regulatory agency for S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
He was accused of providing overly optimistic estimates of the severity of the 
S&amp;L crisis. Wall was repeatedly attacked by members of Congress in 
connection with his delay in closing Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn., the 
Irvine institution that has become a politically damaging symbol of the entire 
S&amp;L debacle. 
</P>
<P>
The shutdown of Lincoln may ultimately cost the government $2 billion. And the 
political contributions by Lincoln's former owner, Charles H. Keating Jr., have 
caused intense embarrassment for five senators. The Federal Home Loan Bank 
Board was abolished by last year's savings and loan rescue legislation, which 
provided $50 billion for the shutdown of crippled S&amp;Ls and payments to 
depositors, whose accounts are insured up to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan has solid connections with the White House, having directed a team of 
lawyers that helped the Bush campaign navigate the complexities of state rules 
and laws on delegates on the way to the presidential nomination in 1988. He 
worked as an advance man in President Richard M. Nixon's 1972 reelection 
campaign, served as general counsel in President Gerald R. Ford's losing bid 
for election in 1976, and joined (former Sen.) Howard H. Baker Jr.'s brief 
effort to win the Republican presidential nomination in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, 44, is currently a partner with the law firm of Reed, Smith, Shaw &amp; 
McClay. The FBI will be undertaking a background check required of high-level 
nominees before his name is formally submitted to the Senate for confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
After passage of the S&amp;L legislation last year, the bank board's powers 
were trimmed, it was renamed the Office of Thrift Supervision and placed in the 
Treasury Department. However, the office still has the authority to set 
financial standards for S&amp;Ls and implement the complex provisions of 
S&amp;L law. Its rulings can mean fiscal life or death for hundreds of 
financially troubled institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The Office of Thrift Supervision is being run temporarily by Salvatore R. 
Martouche, assistant secretary of the Treasury for enforcement. Martouche has 
been responsible for the Secret Service, the Customs Service and government 
activities aimed at money-laundering from illegal activities. 
</P>
<P>
Martouche will hold the post until Ryan is confirmed by the Senate, according 
to Administration sources. ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT

USX Holders to Vote on Icahn Plan: Takeover strategist Carl C. Icahn's proposal 
that USX Corp. spin off its steel division will be put to a vote of 
shareholders, USX said in announcing an agreement on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for the vote, Icahn agreed not to wage a proxy fight or submit 
other matters for consideration at the steel, oil and gas giant's May 7 annual 
meeting, USX said. Stockholders will be asked whether USX should incorporate a 
separate steel business and sell at least 80% of it, Icahn said in documents 
filed with the SEC. The new company would carry no more than $1.5 billion in 
long-term debt.

STUDY QUESTIONS VALUE OF BIOTECH DRUG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO

An expensive drug used to dissolve blood clots in heart attack victims is no 
more effective than a competing drug that costs one-tenth as much, a large 
Italian study of TPA and streptokinase released Thursday in Florence shows. 
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited study, involving 19,000 patients, is the largest study ever to 
directly compare the drugs in heart attack victims. 
</P>
<P>
It shows that there was no significant difference between the two drugs' 
effectiveness among patients treated with TPA or the much less expensive 
streptokinase. 
</P>
<P>
TPA is sold under the brand name Activase by South San Francisco-based 
Genentech. Streptokinase, sold under the brand name Streptase, is distributed 
by West German drug giant Hoechst AG. 
</P>
<P>
Genentech's Activase, a genetically engineered drug, sells for $2,200 a dose 
while stretokinase sells for $200. 
</P>
<P>
Genentech has long contended that its drug is superior to streptokinase, and 
says the high price is justified because of the costs of developing the drug. 
</P>
<P>
TPA is Genentech's major product. Last year it sold nearly $200 million worth 
of the product. 
</P>
<P>
Genentech's stock dropped $1.125 a share to $26.125 on the New York Stock 
Exchange on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the steering committee for the study concluded, "On the basis 
of the present trial's findings, the choice of thrombolytic (clot dissolving) 
treatment cannot be based on clinical grounds alone but must take full account 
of public health economy considerations." 
</P>
<P>
It also said the higher rate at which TPA dissolved clots did not "appear to 
correspond" to a better outcome for heart attack patients. 
</P>
<P>
Genentech said the results of the study did not use a treatment regimen that is 
favored in the United States, which makes the results of little use to American 
doctors. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that this trial offers limited new information to the understanding 
of thrombolytic therapy," said G. Kirk Raab, president and chief executive of 
Genentech. 
</P>
<P>
"Although we don't know how this study will ultimately impact our sales, we are 
confident that physicians will consider their personal experience in treatment 
over 170,000 patients with TPA in the past two years," Raab said in a 
statement.

Trump Shuttle, Pilots Sign Contract: The Air Line Pilots Assn. International 
and the Trump Shuttle signed a 48-month contract. 
</P>
<P>
Ratified by the pilots union Feb. 24, it is retroactive to July, 1989, and will 
expire July 2, 1993. Company executives said it provides for wage increases for 
all 227 Trump Shuttle pilots and gives the fledgling airline the opportunity to 
use aircraft and crews more efficiently and productively. The contract also 
eliminates the two-tier wage scale for Trump Shuttle pilots.

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: HOW TO PASS ALONG A FAMILY BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE APPLEGATE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 36 years of making pierogies, stuffed Polish-style pasta pockets, Ted 
Twardzik figured it was time to sell the family owned business he began on his 
mother's kitchen table. 
</P>
<P>
By 1986, Ateeco Inc.'s 200 workers were producing four million pierogies a 
week. The company had become the largest employer in Shenandoah, an eastern 
Pennsylvania coal-mining town with a population of 7,000. 
</P>
<P>
With sales approaching $15 million a year, Twardzik said he did not feel 
qualified to develop the company into a major player in the food industry. And, 
although his two youngest sons, Tom and Tim, were interested in stepping in, 
Twardzik felt they did not have the maturity or experience needed to build the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
"The big problem is that if your business is successful, the estate taxes make 
it almost impossible to pass it along to your children and grandchildren," 
Twardzik said. 
</P>
<P>
So, for two years, the Twardziks met with several prospective buyers, going as 
far as signing letters of intent with two different companies. With Tim and Tom 
at his side during negotiations, Twardzik said he watched them mature. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, with coaxing from his sons, Twardzik said he decided not to sell the 
business. Last November, the elder Twardzik became chairman. Son Tom, 29, took 
over as president and Tim, 31, became vice president of marketing. 
</P>
<P>
To make sure his employees were turning to his sons for direction, the chairman 
moved into a private office in the Elks Club building he owns down the street 
from his home. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the family is in the throes of completing its succession plan, which 
includes the establishment of trusts, stock transfers and the purchase of 
insurance. The goal is to create a plan that will not only preserve as much 
wealth as possible, but provide for the company's future growth. Ateeco is also 
planning to form an outside board of directors to add new perspectives to their 
future plans. 
</P>
<P>
The Twardziks face what millions of small, family-owned businesses are facing 
every day: how to pass the company along to the children without losing most of 
it to Uncle Sam. 
</P>
<P>
The task is so onerous that fewer than one-third of the country's family-owned 
businesses make it to the second generation, according to Leon Danco, founder 
of the Cleveland-based Center for Family Business. 
</P>
<P>
Uninterested children, squabbles over control and heavy state and federal 
estate taxes all work against the perpetuation of family business in America. 
Yet families like the Twardziks, who turned to estate planners for advice, have 
been able to work out the difficulties and keep the business intact. 
</P>
<P>
"The classic plan is to leave the business to the wife," said Ronald Hartwick, 
an attorney who specializes in estate planning at U.S. Trust of California in 
Los Angeles. "But if all you have is that pure vanilla Pablum plan, it can be a 
disaster." 
</P>
<P>
Hartwick, who has designed estate plans for about 200 small-business owners, 
said too many families focus on minimizing taxes rather than dealing with the 
broader issues of who will actually run the business. He and other estate 
planners recommend sitting down with your family and discussing the future much 
the same way you would plan a vacation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to create a plan that the next generation will not tear apart," 
said Hartwick. "The inheritance business brings out the worst in people." 
</P>
<P>
He encourages small-business owners to be as generous as possible while they 
are alive. Every taxpayer is allowed to give away $10,000 every year, tax-free 
to an unlimited number of individuals. And, under current federal tax laws, 
everyone is entitled to pass along $600,000 tax-free to their children or 
anyone else. This means, if properly planned for, a married couple with a small 
business could transfer $1.2 million worth of property tax-free. 
</P>
<P>
As good as they may be, your day-to-day attorney and accountant may not be the 
best ones to draft an estate plan. They will, however, be able to recommend 
experts in the field. And you should be prepared to spend between $3,000 and 
$15,000 on the completed plan, depending on the complexity of your business and 
personal affairs. 
</P>
<P>
For many families, buying a very large insurance policy to cover the business 
owner and his or her spouse becomes an attractive way to cover estate taxes and 
administrative costs. If you assign the rights to the policy to someone else 
and survive for at least three years, the proceeds may be paid to your heirs 
tax-free. 
</P>
<P>
The premium on a $1-million policy is in the $20,000 a year range, depending on 
the age of the person insured. The best person to consult for this type of 
insurance is a Chartered Life Underwriter, who belongs to a professional 
organization that requires its members to take tough examinations and continue 
their professional education. 
</P>
<P>
The late publisher Malcolm Forbes -- whose empire would definitely not be 
regarded as a small business -- used life insurance to provide his heirs with 
tax-exempt benefits to pay estate taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the money comes from insurance or savings, your family should have 
enough cash to buy out family members who do not want to retain any ownership 
in the company. The money should also provide financial security for the 
remaining spouse and be a comfort, rather than something to be fought over. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Swartz, a partner in the accounting firm of McGladrey &amp; Pullen in 
Minneapolis, said most entrepreneurs are more concerned about the continuity of 
their business than saving money on taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"Most want to enjoy the business they created and then enjoy the prospect of 
having it continue at least one more generation," said Swartz, who has 
counseled about 200 family business owners on organizational and succession 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
In trying to be fair, Swartz said, many family business owners put too much 
weight on equally dividing the business between their heirs. 
</P>
<P>
"One man I worked with kept a notebook with six columns, one for each child," 
said Swartz. "He had kept track of what he gave each one from the time they 
were children." 
</P>
<P>
But Swartz said in reality it is not possible to treat all the children 
equally, especially if some are involved in running the business and others are 
not. "Leaving the business equally to all of your children is a recipe for 
disaster." 
</P>
<P>
Swartz and other family business counselors said the parents must consider 
their own financial security before starting to divide up and give away their 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from considering taxes and technicalities, a successful estate plan 
should begin with a full and frank discussion of your family's goal and dreams. 
</P>
<P>
And, although you want to hear from your children, Swartz said estate planning 
should not be a democratic process. 
</P>
<P>
"Discuss your plans, but don't ask your kids to vote on the plan," advises 
Swartz. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

SIMMONS MAY ASK COURT TO KILL LOCKHEED POISON PILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harold C. Simmons, the Texas financier attempting to take control of Lockheed 
Corp., on Thursday condemned the aerospace firm's "poison pill" provision and 
indicated that he might challenge the anti-takeover defense in court if 
shareholders refuse to eliminate it. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons is waging a proxy battle to replace the current Lockheed board with a 
rival slate that he leads, a challenge that was officially launched Feb. 21. 
Simmons controls NL Industries, a Houston chemical company that owns 18.9% of 
Lockheed stock. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed's poison pill takeover defense is triggered when an investor acquires 
20% or more of Lockheed's shares. At that point, the company can effectively 
reduce that 20% stake by selling additional stock to all other shareholders at 
a discount. Simmons, in an SEC filing Feb. 23, said he would ask Lockheed 
shareholders to eliminate the poison pill when he seeks support for his board 
slate at the Calabasas company's March 29 annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
In his first interview since launching his challenge to the board, Simmons said 
Thursday that he opposes all poison pills and called such provisions "an 
obstruction to the free operation of the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
Simmons noted that he acquired NL Industries in 1986 after successfully 
challenging in court that company's poison pill. A judge ruled the defense 
illegal, saying it discriminated against Simmons in violation of the law in New 
Jersey, where NL Industries was incorporated. 
</P>
<P>
There is no direct analogy to Lockheed's defense because Lockheed is 
incorporated under different laws in Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about a possible court challenge to the Lockheed defense, the investor 
said: "I'm not saying we won't try to get rid of Lockheed's poison pill. 
However, I would like (Lockheed) shareholders to address this" (first). 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed executives have said that the poison pill takeover defense is designed 
to force suitors to offer to buy all shares of Lockheed at a fair price. They 
have said the provision is designed to prevent a shareholder from gaining 
control by gradually buying Lockheed stock until a 51% stake is obtained. 
</P>
<P>
In other developments, a nonprofit shareholders rights group said Thursday that 
it has filed a complaint against Lockheed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, contending that the firm's poison pill prevents shareholders from 
receiving and evaluating offers for their stock. The group, the 
Washington-based United Shareholders Assn., said it also opposes Lockheed's 
plans to spend $8 million on its campaign to counter Simmons' challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed had no immediate comment on Simmons' remarks or on the shareholder 
group's complaint.

DUCOMMUN POSTS PROFIT FOR 1989, ITS 1ST IN 5 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once-ailing Ducommun, a Carson-based aerospace supplier and one of California's 
oldest companies, which spent most of the late 1980s losing money, apparently 
has turned things around, according to an earnings report issued Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
During the first full year since Chairman Norman A. Barkeley stepped into the 
cockpit at Ducommun, the company posted net income of $602,000, contrasted with 
a loss of $19.4 million in 1988. Sales rose to $68.6 million in 1989 from $59.8 
million the year before. 
</P>
<P>
Barkeley, former chairman of Lear Siegler Corp., called 1989 "a transition year 
for the company." 
</P>
<P>
Barkeley instituted cost-cutting and other programs to mop up the company's 
seemingly endless flow of red ink and to improve profit margins. From 1985 
through 1988, Ducommun -- founded in 1849 to sell watches and then general 
merchandise -- lost $86.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
But even 1989 was not a smooth ride for Ducommun, which manufactures various 
components for commercial and military aircraft as well as the space shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
After three straight money-making quarters, Ducommun lost $257,000 in the 
fourth quarter on sales of $17.4 million. Ducommun blamed the loss on its 
AHF-Ducommun subsidiary, which enjoyed a large increase in business as well as 
a boost in overhead expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate turnarounds "are never a straight line up," said Donald R. Schort, 
Ducommun's senior vice president and chief financial officer. "It takes some 
time to shake out." 
</P>
<P>
He added that "1990 looks good and we're optimistic," noting that it is still 
too early to tell if Ducommun will be profitable in the first quarter of 1990. 
But, he added, "we're back on the road to profitability." 
</P>
<P>
Income for 1989 from continuing operations -- before income taxes and an 
extraordinary tax credit -- was $1.07 million, contrasted with a 1988 net loss 
of $14.2 million. Ducommun recorded a $456,000 loss from discontinued 
operations in 1989 from the sale of its cable assembly business. In 1988, the 
loss from discontinued operations was $5.2 million.

CITY MUST BUILD NEW HOUSING FOR THE ELDERLY; 
</P>
<P>
HIDDEN HILLS: A JUDGE WARNS OFFICIALS TO STOP DELAYING THE START OF 
CONSTRUCTION OF LOWER-COST HOUSING FOR SENIOR CITIZENS. 
</P>

<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge sternly warned the city of Hidden Hills on 
Thursday that it must proceed with a court-ordered lower-cost housing plan for 
senior citizens, but stopped short of holding the city in contempt of court. 
</P>
<P>
Judge R. William Schoettler Jr. said he is prepared to order City Council 
members into court and keep them there "eight hours a day, five days a week" 
until they approve the housing plan. 
</P>
<P>
Schoettler left open the possibility that he would hold the city in contempt, 
saying he would enforce a Feb. 5, 1992, deadline for the start of construction. 
</P>
<P>
Warning against unreasonable delays by the city, the judge said: "I want to see 
this accomplished the way it was agreed to be accomplished. If it seems to be 
coming to a halt or not moving with the rapidity that it should be moving, then 
I'll nudge it along myself." 
</P>
<P>
Hidden Hills plunged into controversy last year when the City Council announced 
support for a plan for 46 units of senior housing on land the city later 
annexed from Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The project was part of a court order issued by Schoettler last July, when the 
city agreed to settle a 6-year-old lawsuit by Los Angeles County and a private 
attorney over the city's formation of a redevelopment agency to fund a 
flood-control project. The attorney's suit pointed out that state law requires 
that 20% of redevelopment funds be spent on lower-cost housing. 
</P>
<P>
Tarzana developer Danny Howard is proposing residential and commercial 
development on 25 acres. Howard would build nine luxury homes on 20 acres 
inside the town gates. The commercial construction and lower-cost housing would 
be built on five acres outside the gates. No details on the lower-cost housing 
-- such as whether it will be sold or rented, and at what prices -- have been 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
Amid opposition from residents, the council delayed the annexation, polled city 
residents and discussed disbanding the redevelopment agency. Council members 
have said they believe they have committed the city only to consider -- not to 
approve -- the Howard project. 
</P>
<P>
In light of those developments, Howard last week asked Schoettler to find the 
city in contempt of court. 
</P>
<P>
Schoettler declared Thursday that he believes the settlement agreement binds 
the city to approve the lower-cost housing. If Hidden Hills wishes to change 
the court-ordered agreement, the judge said, "I don't throw this down as a 
gauntlet, but I don't think they can do it without going over my head" to an 
appellate court. 
</P>
<P>
"The City Council is not going to be in a position to change this judgment," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Feb. 5, 1992 deadline the judge set is two years from the day the city 
annexed the Howard property and is in accord with a schedule included in the 
court order. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Wayne K. Lemieux noted that three of the five City Council members 
are seeking re-election and that the housing project is an election issue. 
</P>
<P>
At least three of the four challengers for seats on the five-member council 
have opposed the Howard project. 
</P>
<P>
The judge replied: "I'm not overly concerned one way or the other about new 
members of the City Council, so long as the judgment is carried out." 
</P>
<P>
Two City Council challengers, David Stanley and Howard Klein, were in the 
courtroom but declined to comment afterward. They and challenger Susan Porcaro 
are among a group of residents opposed to the Howard development plan. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Chris K. Van Peski, who is among the council members seeking re-election, 
said he will continue his support for the lower-cost housing plan. 
</P>
<P>
The full council was told of the judge's declaration at a special meeting 
convened Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously he means that we should pay attention," said Councilwoman Colleen 
Hartman. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Planning Commission is scheduled to hold a public hearing on the 
Howard development next Wednesday. The proposal could reach the council 
sometime in April.

COUNCIL FLIES TO THE DEFENSE OF CHICKEN LADY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chicken Lady of Redondo Beach, whose neighbors have tried for years to 
prevent her from keeping a flock of back-yard birds, won another round in the 
long-running feud Wednesday when the City Council voted not to reconsider her 
permit for keeping pet chickens. 
</P>
<P>
Tom White, an orthodontist, bought property with his wife more than three years 
ago for their dream house only to discover that his prospective next-door 
neighbor had a yard full of pet poultry. He had asked the council to revoke the 
wild animal permit they issued two years ago to 37-year-old Roseanne Smith. 
</P>
<P>
White told the council that Smith had displayed "contempt for the law" by 
keeping several dozen chickens on her South Irena Avenue property two years ago 
and on some occasions since then in violation of a city resolution that allowed 
her to keep only six. 
</P>
<P>
But the council angrily turned down the request. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't even know if it's a discomfort living next to chickens," snapped 
Councilwoman Barbara Doerr. "You don't even live on the property yet." 
</P>
<P>
And Councilman Stevan Colin said that "the hammering will probably make more 
noise than the chickens" when construction begins next month on White's 
five-bedroom house. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said Thursday she will not let her flock grow past the half-dozen 
chickens she is permitted. But she added that she is suspicious of White's 
motives. 
</P>
<P>
"They just don't like us," Smith said. "The animals are just an excuse." 
</P>
<P>
"The Chicken Situation," as White and his wife call it, has gone on for more 
than three years, since the Whites bought the lot next door to the seaside 
cottage where Smith has lived all her life. Eager to snap up the lush corner 
lot for their planned Mediterranean-style estate, the Whites said they did not 
realize until after they bought the property that the yard next door was full 
of roosters and hens. 
</P>
<P>
When neighborly appeals to remove the birds did not work, the Whites went to 
City Hall. The council passed a resolution limiting Smith's brood to six birds, 
but soon the yard was again full of chickens. The Whites took Smith to court, 
where she was convicted of violating the conditions of the permit and placed on 
two years' probation, which ended Feb. 23. 
</P>
<P>
In December, after the Whites discovered that Smith's yard was again filled 
with birds, they reported the probation violation, and Smith was ordered by a 
court commissioner who handled the case to get rid of her flock altogether. But 
within weeks, the chickens had been spotted again in Smith's yard, and the 
Whites had filed a new complaint with the court. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the new complaint made it to a hearing, Smith's probation had come 
to an end. The court commissioner this time declined to punish her, noting that 
the criminal system had done everything it could. 
</P>
<P>
So White took the matter to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like we're trying to stomp out chickens. I'm a reasonable person and 
was happy to live with the compromise set two years ago," White said. "But it 
wasn't abided by. It was a chicken farm over there. And come hell or high 
water, that woman will have chickens, and as many as she wants." 
</P>
<P>
White chided the council afterward for "their inability to act effectively," 
and he questioned their objectivity in the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard one council member has ducks," he confided. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Colin conceded, he "used to have ducks three or four years ago," and 
his nephew now has two. 
</P>
<P>
"But those ducks are personally not my personal ducks," Colin insisted, denying 
any conflict of interest.

A PLAYA DEL REY CONDO SUIT AGAINST DEVELOPER NOW IN JURY'S HANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arguing that shoddy construction led to leaky pipes, crumbling floors and units 
so poorly insulated that neighbors could hear each others' daily activities, a 
lawyer for residents of a Playa del Rey condominium told a jury this week that 
the builder of the complex should be forced to pay $15.1 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Lee Barker asked a Superior Court jury in Redondo Beach to order 
developer Don S. Levin and his company, DSL Construction Inc., to pay for 
massive repairs at the 187-unit Manitoba West development, just north of Los 
Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Barker addressed the jury at the end of a four-month civil trial, stemming from 
a lawsuit filed in 1984. "We are asking you to make them pay to make these 
homes safe, decent and habitable," Barker said. 
</P>
<P>
The jury began its deliberations Thursday, after rebuttal arguments by lawyers 
for Levin. The same jury must first decide whether the construction was 
substandard and, if it was, who is to blame, the contractor or three 
subcontractors. 
</P>
<P>
The subcontractors, who are being in turn sued by Levin, also argued this week 
that they are not responsible for any shortcomings at Manitoba West. 
</P>
<P>
All of the builders, in turn, said the condominiums' problems were caused by 
normal wear and tear and poor maintenance by homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
But Barker said the problems began right from the start of construction of the 
condominiums in 1979. According to Barker: 
</P>
<P>
Bathrooms were built without windows or proper vents so that mildew thrived on 
walls, which were not properly waterproofed. 
</P>
<P>
Plumbing was not insulated from the building frame so that the sounds of 
running water reverberated through most of the units. 
</P>
<P>
The thinnest and cheapest copper piping was used, so that pipes leaked in 
nearly half the units. As a result, floors and walls rotted or warped because 
of excessive moisture. 
</P>
<P>
Substandard nails were used and spaced so far apart that the stability of the 
building was endangered. 
</P>
<P>
Walls along hallways were not insulated for sound. 
</P>
<P>
A concrete substitute called Gypcrete, which was poured on floorboards, 
crumbled because it was poorly mixed and applied in too thin a layer. 
</P>
<P>
Buildings were not constructed according to plans, nor up to the Los Angeles 
City Code, making them a potential hazard in the event of a fire or earthquake, 
Barker said. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney argued that insulation was so poor throughout Manitoba West that 
homeowners continually worry that neighbors can hear them cooking, cleaning, 
going to the bathroom and making love. 
</P>
<P>
He mocked some of the developer's suggestions for repairing problems, including 
the proposal of one defense expert that damaged Gypcrete could be found simply 
by walking over floors and listening for crunching. 
</P>
<P>
"None of the homeowners are going to be satisfied with a fat man doing the 
Manitoba shuffle," Barker said. "That's not going to work." 
</P>
<P>
He said the floors need to be extensively rebuilt, not just patched, as the 
developer's lawyers suggested. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate agents have estimated that Manitoba West units lost more than 
$35,000 in value each because of the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Levin's lawyers said Manitoba West was built to acceptable industry standards. 
</P>
<P>
"They should not be measured by a standard of perfection," attorney Thomas 
Janzen told the jury, "but by a standard of reasonableness for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Even when construction met the code, (homeowners) said that wasn't good enough 
yet, that they had to meet a higher standard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rebutting Barker's argument, Janzen said that bathroom ventilation plans used 
at Manitoba West were approved by the city of Los Angeles. Mildew was caused 
because of poor cleaning and maintenance by residents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
All insulation, nails and pipes met building standards and were properly 
installed, Janzen said. Nails were correctly spaced, on average, even if there 
were occasionally gaps greater than allowed by code. 
</P>
<P>
The Gypcrete floor was damaged in spots, requiring patches, but not an entirely 
new floor, as suggested by homeowners, Janzen said. 
</P>
<P>
The defense lawyer said homeowners had stalled in making repairs, perhaps in an 
effort to bolster their lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"It's simply not reasonable to expect a developer to correct problems that one 
recognized and failed to take reasonable measures to correct," Janzen said. 
</P>
<P>
Janzen said repairs should cost $1 million at most. 
</P>
<P>
If the jury finds that there were problems with the construction, Janzen said, 
it should hold three subcontractors responsible -- Western States Gypsum Inc., 
which poured the Gypcrete floor; Champlin Construction, which built the frames 
for the condominiums and Davis Roofing Co., which installed the roofs. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for each of the subcontractors insisted that they had completed their 
work properly and should not be held liable.

COMPTON BOULEVARD FADES AWAY AS REDONDO CHRISTENS MARINE AVE.; 
</P>
<P>
STREETS: THE LAST SOUTH BAY CITY JOINS THE TREND, BUT CRITICS ARE WONDERING WHY 
A PROUD NAME HAS DISAPPEARED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The last mile of Compton Boulevard west of the Harbor Freeway was officially 
dubbed Marine Avenue on Wednesday, erasing from the South Bay a name that once 
coursed proudly all the way from the San Gabriel River to Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The Redondo Beach City Council, the last governing board in the South Bay to 
undertake the name change, cited confusion among residents over addresses in 
joining the rest of the area in renaming the thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ron Cawdrey noted that in the last two years, every other city in 
the South Bay through which the boulevard runs has changed its name to Marine 
Avenue. The only place west of the Harbor (110) Freeway where signs for Compton 
Boulevard exist is the Redondo Beach side of a milelong stretch that forms the 
city's boundary with Hawthorne and Lawndale. 
</P>
<P>
"You tell somebody to turn right on Compton Boulevard and they miss it and end 
up in Torrance," Cawdrey said. But Stevan Colin, the only council member to 
vote against the name change, questioned the motives behind the trend. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just kind of funny to me that in, like, Lawndale, they'd want to have a 
street named Marine," he said. "Or Hawthorne. What do those cities have to do 
with the ocean? 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope that the trend won't be that we start seeing proposals to change 
the names of other streets -- say, Inglewood Avenue," Colin added, referring to 
another city whose citizens, like Compton's, are predominantly black. 
</P>
<P>
The trend has been controversial from its outset. It began in 1988, when a 
Gardena furniture store owner started a petition to rename his city's end of 
the boulevard. Chuck Nader said at the time that he wanted to eliminate 
confusion that had plagued him for the 20 years that his Gardena store was 
situated on a boulevard named for Compton, on the other side of the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Nader's suggestion to rename the street for Los Angeles County Supervisor 
Kenneth Hahn fell through when Hahn objected. The city did go along with 
Nader's second choice, which was to follow the lead of Manhattan Beach, which 
has called the street Marine Avenue since the early 1900s. 
</P>
<P>
The idea, with lobbying from Nader and other businesses, was picked up by other 
cities, to the chagrin of Compton officials. In May, for example, the 
then-superintendent of the Compton Unified School District wrote a scathing 
letter to the mayor of Hawthorne, calling the name change "a slap in the face 
to our community and its residents" and "an ill-disguised effort by those who 
have promoted the idea to disassociate themselves from the Compton community 
and all that it represents." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor responded with the argument that Hawthorne is part of the South Bay 
and "Marine Avenue is a name that is more identifiable with a South Bay city." 
</P>
<P>
But the Compton officials remained unconvinced. In an interview with The Times 
in December, Robert Adams, a former Compton councilman, said the trend was 
based on racism, and added that the South Bay cities "don't want to be 
associated with the city of Compton."

WOO, BRADLEY JOIN FORCES TO OPPOSE FRYMAN CANYON DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley and Councilman Mike Woo teamed up Thursday to try to halt a 
proposed 26-home development above Studio City that would result in filling up 
a canyon and the burial of one of the few year-round streams in the Hollywood 
Hills . 
</P>
<P>
The pair urged city Department of Building and Safety officials to re-evaluate 
their 1988 decision to issue a grading permit to Fred Sahadi, the developer of 
the 63-acre site in Fryman Canyon, and warned Sahadi that they would seek to 
halt his project under federal laws that protect year-round streams. 
</P>
<P>
Woo, in whose district the proposed development is located, called Fryman 
Canyon an irreplaceable wilderness area. The canyon is located near a lookout 
point along Mulholland Drive that offers a panoramic view of the city below. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley planning deputy Jane Blumenfeld said the mayor is hopeful the Santa 
Monica Mountains Conservancy, a public agency committed to acquiring parkland 
in the hills, will be able to buy the canyon from Sahadi, a Century City-based 
developer. She said Joe Edmiston, executive director of the conservancy, 
reportedly has met with Sahadi about the property. 
</P>
<P>
A conservancy purchase of the site would "be an ideal solution," Blumenfeld 
said. Edmiston could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"This project has been in the works for nine years, and it has been through 23 
public hearings," Sahadi said. "This is serious business." He would not comment 
further on the Bradley-Woo efforts to checkmate it. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery that a year-round stream runs through the canyon was a 
breakthrough for the foes of Sahadi's project. Under the federal Clean Water 
Act, any project that would endanger or adversely effect a year-round stream 
first must obtain a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Blumenfeld 
said. 
</P>
<P>
To obtain the permit requires the filing of a environmental impact report. 
Preparing such a report would entail costly delays. In addition, Blumenfeld 
said, she was confident an environmental report would recommend against the 
Sahadi project. 
</P>
<P>
As now planned, that project would require channeling the Fryman Canyon stream 
into a pipe and then the burial of the pipe under thousands of tons of earth as 
the canyon is filled in.

WEEKENDER: WHALE OF A DAY PLANNED FOR THE FAMILY SATURDAY AT POINT VICENTE 
CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Youngsters costumed as a lobster and a sea turtle, a mermaid and a sea king, 
will lend a little ocean atmosphere to a celebration Saturday at the Point 
Vicente Interpretive Center in Rancho Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
But the stars of the day -- and everyone hopes a lot of them will show up -- 
will be the large Pacific gray whales swimming along the coastline. 
</P>
<P>
"This weekend we'll see grays. I can guarantee it," said Alisa Schulman, a 
marine biologist and one of the speakers taking part in "Whale of a Day!", a 
family-oriented festival that will combine whale watching with a day of fun in 
the park. 
</P>
<P>
Schulman, who heads the annual whale census conducted at Point Vicente by the 
American Cetacean Society's Los Angeles chapter, said a variety of dolphins are 
very likely to make appearances. Killer whales and humpback whales may also be 
sighted. 
</P>
<P>
A good omen for Saturday was the sighting of some 40 whales off the point 
Wednesday, according to Diana McIntyre, a whale expert and coordinator of the 
center's volunteer docents. 
</P>
<P>
Even though thousands of people take to boats to catch glimpses of the passing 
grays during the migration season, the bluffs along Point Vicente are actually 
one of the best places to see them in Southern California, say whale experts 
and interpretive center representatives. The animals sometimes venture as close 
as the kelp beds 50 yards from shore. 
</P>
<P>
"The whales use Point Vicente as a navigation aid," said Nancy Rosenthal, 
director of the center, a city-owned cultural and natural history museum on the 
Palos Verdes Peninsula. "They come down from Point Dume and head right toward 
Point Vicente. Whales tend to stay closer to the shore where the water is 
warmer." 
</P>
<P>
"The point is accessible to the public. It does jut out and we traditionally 
see a lot of whales real close," Schulman said. 
</P>
<P>
Since it opened six years ago, the center has featured whale displays -- 
including a model of a baby whale -- and conducted educational programs on the 
annual migration. Between November and April, thousands of whales swim along 
the coast on their 12,000-mile round trip from the Bering Sea in Alaska to the 
lagoons of Baja California, where they mate and bear their young. 
</P>
<P>
The whale festival has been an annual event ever since the center opened, but 
had been held in January. It was moved to early March this year because that's 
an optimum time to see the whales. Schulman said that visitors can expect to 
see the whales heading northward to Alaska at a relatively slow pace -- "just 
trucking along." 
</P>
<P>
Even though a whale rolling, spouting or propelling itself out of the water is 
pretty spectacular to the naked eye, Schulman suggests using binoculars. "Many 
may be out there a mile, and if you have binoculars you look like you're very, 
very close," she said. 
</P>
<P>
About 80 docents will be on hand to answer questions about whales and conduct 
tours of the museum. Several conservation organizations will also take part, 
talking about such things as the problem of whales becoming entangled in large 
nets used by commercial fishermen. The educational team from Sea World in San 
Diego will display an inflatable, life-sized, 50-foot-long gray whale. 
</P>

station next to the interpretive center, will discuss the lighthouse -- 
including tales of its supposed female ghost. "People who come to see the 
whales always have an awful lot of questions regarding the lighthouse," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to whale and lighthouse lore, the day's events will include sales 
of baked goods and T-shirts, food booths and arts and crafts displays, some 
featuring marine photography. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a family event," said Rosenthal, noting that more than 1,500 people 
usually attend. "We are in a very beautiful park. . . . It's just a very nice, 
relaxing day for people to learn more about marine life." 
</P>
<P>
Schulman said people are fascinated by whales because, like humans, they're 
mammals. "It's a warm-blooded animal, gives live births, forms long-term 
attachments and protects its young fiercely," she said. Observing a huge whale 
is not like pinning something on a wall, she said. "Here we are out there with 
a wild animal."

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GAY PICKETERS PROTEST ARREST OF BAR OWNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 40 representatives of homosexual rights organizations picketed the 
Van Nuys Courthouse on Thursday to protest what they claim was the 
discriminatory arrest and prosecution of the owner of a Van Nuys gay bar. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was on behalf of Frank J. Roedel, owner of the In Touch bar 
at 5248 Van Nuys Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
Roedel was arrested along with seven customers and three male exotic dancers in 
a raid on the bar by Los Angeles vice officers Dec. 11, said Marty Vranicar, 
head of the Van Nuys branch of the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Police observed lewd conduct by the dancers and customers, Vranicar said. The 
city attorney's office decided not to charge the customers and dancers, partly 
because appellate courts have consistently held that exotic dancing is 
protected by the First Amendment, Vranicar said. 
</P>
<P>
But Roedel was charged with violating a section of the state Business and 
Professions Code that prohibits running a disorderly establishment where liquor 
is served, Vranicar said. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing pink armbands, the demonstrators quietly watched as Commissioner 
Rebecca Omens-Rochman postponed Roedel's trial until April 23 to allow him time 
to change attorneys. The demonstrators contended that the bar is being singled 
out because of its homosexual clientele. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Roedel could be sentenced to a maximum of six months in jail and 
a $1,000 fine, Vranicar said.

DISTRICT TO SEEK MORE MINORITY TEACHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Antelope Valley Union High School District, faced with a 30% 
minority-student enrollment that is still climbing, has approved an affirmative 
action plan aimed at increasing the district's relatively small number of 
minority teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in the nearly 10,000-student district said the goal of the plan is to 
hire 19 more minority teachers in each of the next three years. The district 
said the hiring plan should increase the percentage of minority teachers in the 
district from 8.9% to 16.4% by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
District officials acknowledged that the plan will not bring about parity in 
the ethnic makeup of students and teachers any time soon, in part because 
minority student enrollments are expected to continue increasing and because 
minority teaching candidates are in demand by urban school districts. But they 
said the plan will narrow the gap. 
</P>
<P>
"I think clearly we have an obligation to have a staff that is reflective to 
the extent possible of our community," said Michael Rossi, a district assistant 
superintendent. "I don't think it will be an easily accomplished objective. I 
think it's long-range at best." 
</P>
<P>
The affirmative action plan was approved unanimously Wednesday night by the 
district's Board of Trustees. The plans calls for aggressive teacher recruiting 
at minority colleges and the establishment of an affirmative action committee 
to study the issue further and make additional recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos, who make up 17.8% of the students, are the fastest-growing group, 
increasing nearly 32% since last year. Black students now represent 8.4% of the 
district's enrollment, a 17% increase from last year. Asians account for 2.4% 
of the students, up 26.6% over last year. The remaining 1.8% are Filipinos, 
American Indians and others. 
</P>
<P>
The percentage of white students declined from 74.3% in 1988-89 to 69.6% this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the percentage of minority teachers increased slightly from 8.6% 
last year to 8.9% this year.

SCHOOLS WON'T PUNISH PROTESTERS; 
</P>
<P>
SANCTIONS: ANTELOPE VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL OFFICIALS SAID FEW OF THE STUDENTS WHO 
BOYCOTTED CLASSES OVER AN ANTI-GANG DRESS CODE WILL BE SUSPENDED.

Antelope Valley Union High School District students who spoke out against a new 
anti-gang dress code at a school board meeting Wednesday night will not be 
punished for their remarks, as some students had feared, school officials said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
After students failed to mount a major protest at the meeting, some claimed 
that the turnout was poor because school officials had threatened to discipline 
any students who spoke out. 
</P>
<P>
School officials said no such threats were made. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said most of the nearly 400 students who participated in class 
boycotts last Thursday and Friday to protest the new dress code will not face 
suspension or expulsion, although some will face lesser sanctions for missing 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
Yvonne Healey, principal at Antelope Valley High School, said she plans no 
action against most of the about 175 students involved in the protests at her 
campus. However, if a parent of a student who missed class requests 
disciplinary action, a child could be ordered to attend four hours of school on 
Saturdays or perform cleanup assignments, Healey said. 
</P>
<P>
She said three students drew three-day suspensions for disrupting classes 
during protests at the high school. Another student was suspended for five days 
for throwing rocks Thursday at a sheriff's patrol car, she said. 
</P>
<P>
At Palmdale High School, Principal Linda Janzen said she planned to suspend 
none of the more than 200 students who staged a three-hour class boycott last 
Thursday. She said some students might face lesser sanctions for missing 
classes.

THEIR MAKEUP? IT ONLY LOOKS EXPENSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ever wonder what cosmetics enhance actress Kim Basinger's sensual lips, 
singer-actress Grace Jones' chiseled cheek bones or talk-show host Joan Rivers' 
long, long lashes? 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, it isn't always luxury or designer products. Most celebs are 
primed for appearences on TV and in films by professional makeup artists. And 
these experts agree that the price of cosmetics does not necessarily equate 
with quality. 
</P>
<P>
"Expensive cosmetics look nice inside the box, but just because they are 
expensive they're not necessarily good," says Rex, a makeup artist with the 
Timothy Priano booking agency in New York City. Rex has painted super-models 
Isabella Rossellini, Paulina and Iman. Designer Donna Karan hires him each 
season to make up her entire entourage of models at the New York press show. 
</P>
<P>
Rex's biggest upcoming assignment -- readying Ivana Trump for a shoot in 
Harper's Bazaar -- doesn't mean he'll substitute prestige products for his 
bargain favorites. 
</P>
<P>
"She'll get the Maybelline like everyone else," he quips, as he raves about the 
company's Great Lash mascara, which sells for about $3 at Target stores. 
</P>
<P>
Great Lash is also the choice of Wayne Massarelli of Los Angeles' HMS Bookings, 
whose client list includes Joan Rivers and Jane Fonda. Massarelli says the bulk 
of his products are made exclusively for professionals by Christian Dior. But 
Massarelli fills in with blush and eye pencils by La Femme, which he buys at 
Columbia Cosmetics, a beauty supply shop at Sunset and Gower. The pencils run 
about $2.50 and blushes range in price from $2.30 to $2.75. 
</P>
<P>
La Femme makes "a lot of natural, matte colors -- and in fashion and TV, the 
trend is toward flat, warm colors," Massarelli says. 
</P>
<P>
Makeup artist Tara Posey also favors La Femme blushes. Posey has made up the 
faces of Janet Jackson, Natalie Cole and Jasmine Guy, among others. She also 
likes the cheap chic achieved with Maybelline Eyebrow pencils, which sell for 
$1.64 for a two-pack at Thrifty Drug Stores. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't melt as fast, so they don't smear as much," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Darrell Redleaf of L.A.'s Celestine-Cloutier booking agency has made up Grace 
Jones, Sally Kellerman and Pia Zadora, among others. His favorite lipstick: Wet 
'n' Wild, which sells for as little as 99 cents. 
</P>
<P>
"I particularly like the intense, steamy colors," says Redleaf. When he can't 
find the exact color he wants, Redleaf opts for lip pencils made by Flori 
Roberts mixed with Carmex lip balm, which sells for about 89 cents at drug and 
discount stores. 
</P>
<P>
"I think with a pencil and Carmex you can get a matte yet moist looking lip 
stain," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Like so many of his colleagues, Redleaf uses Great Lash mascara. Though Redleaf 
doesn't use many inexpensive foundations, he has used Almay foundations from 
time to time, which sell for about $4 at J.C. Penney stores. But when it comes 
to foundation, most makeup artists (Redleaf included) agree that makeup mavens 
are better off pinching pennies on color products and investing in a pricier 
base. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty hard to skimp on foundation; they are often too pink or too 
powdery," Redleaf says.

DRESSED UP WITH NEON ACCENTS, A NEW STYLE OF SKATE SPEEDS ALONG THE CUTTING 
EDGE OF FASHIONABLE FITNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
These days, roller-skating not only has a new look but a new name. "We don't 
roller-skate anymore," says one denizen of the Venice bike path, where skaters 
and cyclists vie for space. "We roller-blade." 
</P>
<P>
He is referring, of course, to Rollerblade, the in-line skate that has 
revolutionized California skating. Unlike conventional skates, it aligns its 
wheels along a single blade, similar to an ice skate, for a faster, smoother 
ride. In the past few years, it has made outdoor skating, which was as dead as 
disco, respectable again. 
</P>
<P>
The new skate was introduced in Minneapolis in 1980 and was marketed as an 
off-season training tool for National Hockey League players and cross-country 
skiers. But California's year-round skating season presented the company with a 
golden opportunity. Since 1986, when Rollerblade began aggressively courting 
the general fitness market, the new style of skate has gone from a novelty item 
to one responsible for about $30 million retail sales in 1989. Roughly 20% of 
these sales were made in California. 
</P>
<P>
Rollerblade, which has captured about three-quarters of the market, understood 
the importance of California. As the company became more tuned-in to the 
California scene, says Mary Horwath, public relations director for Rollerblade, 
it took its cue from the surf-wear industry and upgraded the skate's look. 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, the skates had all the charm of clunky, unadorned ski boots. 
Over the past several seasons, however, Rollerblade has dressed the skate up 
with neon accents and accessories. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the five-wheel racing model, which will be available May 1 for a 
record list price of $330, features a medium-cut gray boot with grape and 
apple-green accents. The Macroblade skate, which lists for about $250 at 
outlets like Sports Chalet and skate shops such as Rip City in Santa Monica, is 
aimed at advance skaters; its black boot is set off with fluorescent yellow 
strap buckles. The most popular model, the Lightning, comes in a white or black 
boot and can be individualized with a wide choice of laces, wheels and foot 
liners. 
</P>
<P>
Some attendant safety gear is shaping up style-wise, too. Plastic orbs on elbow 
and knee pads are now available in grape or fluorescent yellow, not just white. 
Safety gloves, with their padded leather palms, feature bold grape/mint or 
turquoise/yellow striped fronts. And, in response to the growth of open-road 
and ramp skating, Rollerblade has introduced a handsome, hand-laminated 
fiberglass helmet, with a boldly emblazoned logo across the top. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to apparel, however, skate wear remains surprisingly traditional. 
Because the sport attracts an eclectic mix of athletes and because it places no 
fundamentally unique demands on the clothes, there is no real need for skating 
outfits. 
</P>
<P>
"The sport does a great job developing the lower body," says Chris Morris, a 
sales representative for Rollerblade. "Once you've got the musculature, you are 
going to wear whatever shows that off best." 
</P>

RECORD INDUSTRY GEARING UP FOR A WAR OF WORDS; 
</P>
<P>
REGULATION: AMID CRIES FOR ALBUM WARNINGS, EXECUTIVES ARE CONVERGING ON L.A. 
FOR THEIR ANNUAL MEETING. THE CONFERENCE WILL OFFER A CHANCE TO FORGE A UNIFIED 
LANGUAGE POLICY.

An embattled record industry is circling its wagons to fight a multifront war 
over an issue that has parents' groups and state legislatures up in arms, 
record retailers worried about stiff legal penalties and recording artists 
protesting assaults on their freedom of expression. 
</P>
<P>
As the industry prepares to open one of its biggest annual meetings this 
weekend in Los Angeles, insiders acknowledge that increasing calls for some 
kind of regulation of the language of popular music has become one of the 
foremost issues facing performers, record distributors and store operators 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Bills that would require record albums to carry some kind of stickers warning 
of explicit content are before legislatures in six states, with at least 15 
others considering similar measures. Some bills would even require labeling of 
records that deal with topics such as adultery, murder, satanism or bestiality. 
</P>
<P>
Some states' bills propose fines and jail sentences for retailers who sell the 
questionable recordings without stickers or sell stickered material to minors. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, 2,500 industry officials will descend on the Century Plaza Hotel 
for the four-day National Assn. of Recording Merchandisers convention. Some 
expect the meeting to provide an opportunity for the industry to forge a 
unified policy on the language issue, but others fear that this public meeting 
will show that the various elements of the record business are far from united. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say it's approaching panic, but definitely a real grave concern," 
said John Mitchell, legislative counsel for the association of record store 
owners. "Right now we're seeing a diversity of viewpoints. We haven't reached 
the point where the views would be debated and a consensus reached." 
</P>
<P>
The prevailing opinion throughout the record industry is that the current bills 
are unconstitutional, both due to broad wording and the historical 
unwillingness of the Supreme Court to set obscenity standards to artistic 
material. 
</P>
<P>
But the debate over the language issue intensified this week as industry 
leaders quietly discussed possible strategies. Most controversial was talk of 
an industry-applied album ratings system similar to the G, PG, PG-13, R and X 
system that movie companies adopted years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Word spread earlier in the week through recording-industry circles that 
officials of the huge West German-owned BMG distribution group were considering 
a ratings-system plan along with some other proposals. The company owns RCA 
Records and distributes several other labels. 
</P>
<P>
But quick negative response to the firm's apparent trial balloon brought a 
retreat from the notion. BMG president Pete Jones issued a broadly worded 
statement "against all forms of governmental censorship" but in support of 
"each record company unilaterally labeling product which in its determination 
it considers appropriate for labeling" and "the creation of uniform label 
language and placement" throughout the industry. 
</P>
<P>
"People in the industry are afraid," said Trish Heimers, Recording Industry 
Assn. of America vice president of public relations and a scheduled participant 
at a convention panel on Monday that is likely to be one of the meeting's 
hottest sessions: "To Sticker . . . or Not to Sticker: The Censorship Issue." 
</P>
<P>
Heimers said that the situation has led to many "rash opinions" being proposed, 
but acknowledged industry discussion of a standardized voluntary labeling 
system. "I'm not saying there is a standardized system in the works, just talk 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the industry comes up with at this week's convention, it is not likely 
to appease the legislators. Arizona State Sen. Janice Drinkwine Brewer, who is 
sponsoring a strict stickering bill in her state, said she would not be willing 
to settle for the industry offering much less than a movie-style system. (The 
bill on Monday passed its first committee vote 8-1, despite testimony from 
singer Donny Osmond, who expressed concern about the government usurping 
parental responsibility and cautioned that a warning sticker could become a 
coveted selling tool for some acts.) 
</P>
<P>
The voluntary plan is not enough, Brewer said, noting that the industry already 
voluntarily stickers releases. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad they're taking it seriously and would be glad to work with them in 
any way so we can address the issues," Brewer said. "But I have no intent of 
putting my bill on hold." 
</P>
<P>
But the executive director of the Parents Music Resource Center says even the 
voluntary system that already exists would be enough -- if all record companies 
abided by it uniformly. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't support any other system," said Jennifer Norwood. "We're opposed to 
mandatory labeling, anyone else stepping in and telling the industry what they 
can and can't release. We, on the other hand, are an organization that hears 
from parents all over the country and hears a lot of dissatisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
Henry Droz, president of Time-Warner Inc.'s industry-leading 
Warner/Elektra/Atlantic (WEA), refused requests for a phone interview. A WEA 
spokesman referred all inquiries on the labeling issue to the recording 
industry association. 
</P>
<P>
Russ Bach, president of the British-owned CEMA distribution group (Capitol 
Records and others) was willing to talk, stating his support of voluntary 
labeling, but offering no specific plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I came out last summer in favor of labeling and a responsible look at the 
content of lyrics by the record companies," Bach said. "I have not changed my 
mind and I support our customers (record retail outlets) on the need for 
uniform labeling." 
</P>
<P>
Why the sharp reaction against a movie-style ratings system? 
</P>
<P>
"We're dealing with 25,000 releases a year here as opposed to just 300 movies," 
said Mike Greene, president of the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; 
Sciences, and another scheduled participant on Monday's convention panel. "What 
we would see for this, unless there was a huge manpower budget, is a cookie 
cutter system." 
</P>
<P>
Greene and others also pointed out that rating movies, in which visual content 
and language use are easy to identify, is a different matter from songs, in 
which interpretation of content can be subjective. 
</P>
<P>
Although most label executives and artists are not enthusiastic about a ratings 
system, many retailers are. They tend to view a ratings system as protection 
against potential prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
The distributors are caught in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
"What it basically comes down to is for a certain group, for NARM and the RIAA, 
a mercantile question," said Greene. "But for the creative community it comes 
down to an artistic decision." 
</P>
<P>
But even some artists have found themselves on the fence about the issue. Paul 
McCartney, commenting backstage at last month's Grammy awards show, said that 
though he opposes any kind of censorship, as a parent he understands the 
motivation behind the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Russ Solomon, president of the Tower Records chain, with 54 stores in the 
United States, said that he believes most retailers "don't mind voluntary 
labeling" and are willing and able to make their own determinations of what is 
or is not appropriate to sell and to whom, as they already do with such 
magazines as Penthouse and Playboy, which are sold in some of his stores. 
</P>
<P>
But, he added: "The last thing we want is some sheriff to come in and arrest a 
clerk. We went through that in the old days when we sold marijuana 
paraphernalia."

Record ratings -- A record industry proposal for a movies-style ratings system 
for recorded music was one of many ideas discussed at an industry-wide meeting 
and not a proposal made by representatives of the BMG distribution group, as 
was reported in a March 9 Calendar article. Due to an editing error, the 
proposal was inaccurately characterized as an apparent trial balloon 
originating with BMG.

THE NEWS GLUT: FILM AT 11 . . . AND 10 AND 9 . . .; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: THERE ARE NEWSCASTS ALL OVER THE DIAL, BUT NETWORK VIEWERSHIP IS 
DECLINING.

News, news and more news -- Los Angeles television viewers have never had more 
choices, more newscasts, more hours of the day in which to get their fill of 
the day's events. As a result, fewer local residents are tuning to the three 
network-owned stations that traditionally have provided the bulk of local TV 
news. 
</P>
<P>
Total viewership of the daily 5 p.m. newscasts on KCBS Channel 2, KNBC Channel 
4 and KABC-TV Channel 7 during February was down 12% from the same month in 
1989 -- even though the size of the local audience had grown. The cumulative 
audience for newscasts on those stations was also down 3% at 4 p.m. and at 6 
p.m. Combined Nielsen ratings at 11 p.m. were the same as last year but off 21% 
from February, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a feeling that people are just sated with it," said Dan Gingold, 
assistant professor of broadcast journalism at USC and a former news producer 
at Channel 2. "There's just too much of it -- and by the very fact that there 
is so much, it tends to be repetitive and rather unsatisfying unless there is a 
major story, like an earthquake. . . . It's like eating too many jelly beans -- 
you lose your taste for it after awhile." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Hyland, general manager at KCBS, would not call last month's sharp drop 
"a trend," but he acknowledged that the abundance of broadcast news outlets in 
Southern California -- CNN, four major independent stations, two 
Spanish-language TV stations, two all-news radio stations, National Public 
Radio, Financial News Network, plus the tabloid or "softer" news programs "Hard 
Copy," "A Current Affair" and "Entertainment Tonight" -- "may have diluted some 
of the numbers." 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many choices today," Hyland said. "TV used to be predictable. 
Viewers watched local news, then network news and then the network prime-time 
schedule. Now you need a magnifying glass to read the TV Guide. And viewers 
don't have loyalty anymore to a network or a station -- they graze through the 
schedule each hour and pick out a sitcom or news or ESPN or whatever they 
want." 
</P>
<P>
The increasing entertainment choices on cable and the increasing strength of 
the counterprogramming on the independent stations have also contributed to the 
erosion of the local news audience in the afternoon and at 11 p.m. So has the 
declining prime-time ratings of the three stations' parent networks -- down 8% 
in February compared to February, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Local news observers also speculate that the newscasts on Channels 2, 4 and 7 
have become indistinguishable, filled increasingly with inconsequential 
features. In the past, these observers say, highly promoted, sensationalized 
"mini-docs" served to differentiate the stations during ratings sweeps periods, 
but those produced last month were far tamer than previous years. 
</P>
<P>
"There just isn't enough local news -- especially since national and 
international news are mostly ignored -- to fill all of those hours," said 
Steve Bell, general manager of KTLA Channel 5, whose top-rated 10 p.m. newscast 
has not been plagued by audience defections. "And as the stations realized 
this, they more and more desperately tried to manufacture news and, as a 
result, they watered down their own product. The public isn't fooled. They have 
simply grown weary of all this and are taking advantage of all the 
alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to pinpoint exactly where the audience that used to watch news 
has gone, because local ratings for all cable channels were unavailable. But 
nationally, basic cable has increased its viewership about 18% in the last 
year. And KTLA's reruns of "Hunter," which Bell claims is stealing adult 
viewers from the news, won the 6-7 p.m. time period last month, beating local 
and national news as well as sitcoms on the three other independents. 
</P>
<P>
The network-owned stations already have cut back their news programming. Where 
once they each offered three hours of news in the afternoon, today only KABC-TV 
continues to do so -- and it plans to eliminate half an hour this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Bell predicted that both Channel 7 and Channel 4 would junk their 4 p.m. news 
if ratings continue to slide. Though the stations generally are eager to crow 
about good ratings news, the general managers at both Channel 4 and Channel 7 
declined to comment for this article. 
</P>
<P>
John Severino, formerly the general manager of KABC Channel 7 and a former 
president of ABC Television, said that the drop in viewership at the network 
affiliates is occuring all over the country as the networks' share of the 
audience declines. 
</P>
<P>
When he was at ABC in the early 1980s, he recalled, he would travel to the 
affiliates and assure them that the three-network share of prime time would 
never drop below 90%. "A few months later," he said, "we would tell them it 
would never drop below 85%. Then we would go around and say never below 80%. 
Now it's down to 65%, and I heard Bob Wright (president of NBC) say recently 
that it could fall to 55%." 
</P>
<P>
Severino, who now is president of the Prime Ticket cable sports network, said 
that the decreasing network audience means fewer people are available to watch 
promos for the affiliate stations' newscasts. That, coupled with the increasing 
strength of the independents and the growth of cable, means fewer news viewers. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, Prime Ticket will provide even more competition for the 
network-owned stations when it premieres two daily, all-sports newscasts at 7 
p.m. and 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the drop in ratings, however, news still remains enormously lucrative 
for these stations, Severino said. They can live with lower ratings because of 
cuts in expenditures demanded a few years back when new owners took over the 
parent corporations -- Laurence Tisch at CBS, General Electric at NBC and 
Capital Cities at ABC. 
</P>
<P>
"Years ago, when profits were so high, we could add staff every year," KCBS' 
Hyland recalled. "With the market share shrinking, we can't do that. Everyone 
has had to cut back. We're all in a lean and mean mode." 
</P>
<P>
Hyland maintained that the cuts have not hurt the quality of the product, but 
Bell contended that the stations simply may no longer have the resources to 
adequately fill all those hours of news every day. 
</P>
<P>
Though Severino said that he does not believe the stations will cut their news 
expenditures any further -- and that they may in fact have to increase their 
advertising and promotion budgets -- he thinks that one of the stations will 
have to try something radically different to distinguish it from the other two. 
If they all continue to look the same and report the same news, he said, the 
decline will continue indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Hyland said that much depends on what the networks program in prime time. Last 
year, CBS aired the blockbuster miniseries "Lonesome Dove" in February, and 
that helped draw viewers to local news following the entertainment programs. 
Last month, there were no smash hits on any of the networks. 
</P>
<P>
"When the network share goes up, obviously viewers are sampling your station 
and it is easier to get them to sample the news," Hyland said. "When there is a 
big show at 10 p.m., you can sell your newscast during that program and people 
will be willing to hang in there. We're all fighting like hell to give our 
station some brand awareness, but when the viewer has 40 choices every half 
hour, it's getting more and more difficult to do that."

AIRWAVES: ONE POLL SHOWS A LOS ANGELES RADIO STATION ASNO. 1 IN THE 
LANCASTER-PALMDALE MARKET. NEW RESIDENTS WITH MORE URBAN TASTES ARE CREDITED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Larry Thornhill, manager of two rock radio stations in Lancaster, got an 
unpleasant surprise last February when he tried to find out what residents were 
listening to. 
</P>
<P>
Arbitron, the major radio ratings service, lumps the Antelope Valley in with 
the vast Los Angeles market. So Thornhill hired a research firm to survey the 
Lancaster-Palmdale region. In previous polls, he said, the top spot was always 
held by one of the Antelope Valley's eight stations, but the results last 
February were startling. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, a Los Angeles radio station came in No. 1," Thornhill 
said. "It was KLOS." 
</P>
<P>
For years, the Antelope Valley's low-powered radio stations (1,000 to 5,000 
watts compared with KLOS' 68,000 or KPWR's 72,000 watts) have had a lock on the 
isolated high desert market north of Los Angeles. The San Gabriel Mountains 
block the signals from many L.A. stations, and those powerhouse operations that 
do reach the area have high advertising rates that would break the budgets of 
small Antelope Valley merchants. 
</P>
<P>
But the market is changing. In recent years, affordable housing has lured 
thousands of new residents to Palmdale and Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles radio is now recognizing the potential out here," said Thornhill, 
who manages sister stations KAVL-AM and KAVS-FM. "You're seeing more billboards 
out here. You're seeing more of a concentrated effort to get bumper stickers 
out here. KIIS-FM, for example, now has bumper stickers in all the Taco Bells 
out here. Los Angeles radio's recognizing the big audience out here." 
</P>
<P>
Some Antelope Valley broadcasters are concerned because the Los Angeles 
stations can afford big promotional pushes, including splashy television ads. 
In addition, many of the people moving to Palmdale and Lancaster have brought 
their Los Angeles listening habits with them -- and refuse to even sample local 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
"That's our biggest problem by far," Thornhill said. "When we look at next 
year, we have to build into our budget billboard expenses. That's going to be 
our biggest frontal attack next year -- to try to re-educate new residents." 
</P>
<P>
In the February survey, Thornhill's KAVS, which has a contemporary-hits format, 
placed second to Los Angeles rocker KLOS. To fight back, Thornhill added on-air 
personalities during prime broadcast hours. Previously, KAVS had been automated 
all day. The new hires included a two-man morning team that offers the type of 
banter popularized by KLOS' Mark and Brian. 
</P>
<P>
Other local broadcasters try to compete with Los Angeles by offering Antelope 
Valley news, weather and sports reports. They also do remote broadcasts from 
local shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
They boast that their advertising rates are a bargain. A drive-time spot on an 
Antelope Valley station may cost about $20. The same ad on a highly rated Los 
Angeles radio show sometimes sells for more than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Several Los Angeles radio executives denied that the Antelope Valley has been 
singled out for heavy promotion. They said local billboard and bumper-sticker 
giveaways are part of a regionwide campaign to attract listeners. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to get to every area that we cover in Southern California," said Duncan 
Payton, promotions director for Burbank-based KPWR. "We realize our listeners 
are all over the Southland." 
</P>
<P>
Added Steven Smith, director of advertising and promotion at KLOS: "We haven't 
taken a more aggressive approach" in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But Smith said his station was involved this year in auto racing events in 
Palmdale and Rosemond. Earlier, it did a remote broadcast from a Wrightwood ski 
resort, on the edge of the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"We've thought about going to the Antelope Valley Fair because we're involved 
in the Los Angeles and Orange County fairs. But with the timing and the 
distance from Los Angeles, we just haven't gotten around to it," Smith said. 
"We think we would do very well out there. There seem to be a lot of fans in 
that area." 
</P>
<P>
The Antelope Valley's value as a radio market became evident a few months ago 
when Encino-based entertainment firm Eric/Chandler Ltd. announced that it was 
buying Lancaster sister stations KKZZ-FM and KHJJ-AM for $3.6 million. 
Eric/Chandler owns Avalon Attractions and is already a Los Angeles concert 
promotion heavyweight. It also has business ties to a popular Orange County 
concert venue, Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Miserendino, president of Eric/Chandler, said his firm has been awaiting 
final Federal Communications Commission approval of the sale. Meanwhile, it is 
researching Antelope Valley audiences to determine whether format changes are 
needed. KKZZ now plays light adult contemporary music, while KHJJ spins hits 
from the 1960s and 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"The Antelope Valley is growing by leaps and bounds," Miserendino said. "The 
market is growing at a great pace, and radio is a part of everyone's life. And 
advertisers need a place to advertise. While the signals from the Los Angeles 
station do come in, most of the retailers can't afford to pay those rates." 
</P>
<P>
The Lancaster stations' new affiliation with Eric/Chandler has already enabled 
them to launch a major giveaway. Because Avalon presented the recent sold-out 
Rolling Stones concerts in Los Angeles, KHJJ was able to get about 120 tickets 
to distribute to its listeners. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys are experts at promotions," said J.R. Engel, co-manager of KKZZ and 
KHJJ. 
</P>
<P>
Engel said the new owners are expected to beef up equipment and personnel to 
make the stations more competitive. Engel has already hired a news director to 
begin covering the area. 
</P>
<P>
Some Antelope Valley broadcasters are worried that format changes at KKZZ or 
KHJJ could alter the way the local audience is now divided. 
</P>
<P>
"It scares us to death," said KAVS' Thornhill. "We don't have any competition 
other than Los Angeles now. Any new contemporary-hits station that comes in 
here is going to give us a tough time." 
</P>
<P>
But Dale P. Ware, general manager of KOTY-AM in Palmdale, is less concerned 
about the Eric/Chandler purchase. "I'm pleased in a lot of ways because it 
makes all of us pull our socks up," he said. "On the positive side, they will 
come in, and the ad rates will go up to where they should be." 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley broadcasters say the rates are low partly because their 
stations operate in the shadow of the Los Angeles giants. And because the 
region is not surveyed independently by Arbitron, it is difficult to document 
listening habits and attract national advertisers. Finally, they say, in the 
scramble for local ad dollars, many sales people further discount their rates. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to take somebody from out of town coming in here to say, 'Hey, wait 
a minute. This is dumb. This is stupid,' " Ware said. "They'll set higher rates 
because they know they can get those kind of rates." 
</P>
<P>
Other Antelope Valley broadcasters say Ware faces a particularly tough 
challenge because he operates an AM country station with no FM affiliate at a 
time when most young music lovers keep their radios tuned to FM. 
</P>
<P>
Ware said he has been trying to broaden the station's appeal by positioning it 
as a key source of information. It presents local news reports and recently 
launched a two-hour morning talk show. Guests have included local leaders and 
country music stars. The station also operates an interactive phone service 
that allows listeners to call in for recorded updates of sports, weather or 
winning lottery numbers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Ware boasts that, unlike many of the local stations, his signal 
reaches as far as Santa Clarita -- a key advantage in reaching up to 30,000 
Antelope Valley residents who commute daily to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
KUTY is criticized by some rivals for its failure to use local disc jockeys. 
Its country music comes from a national satellite service based in Illinois. 
Antelope Valley listeners must dial a toll-free number to talk to the disc 
jockey. 
</P>
<P>
Ware said he prefers not to hire the inexperienced young disc jockeys who 
traditionally hone their skills in small markets such as the Antelope Valley. 
"We feel our listeners deserve more than that," he said. "The other reason is 
because when you're in a small market, you've only got so many dollars to put 
into your personnel. We opted to put our money into news." 
</P>
<P>
At least one Antelope Valley broadcaster remains undisturbed by the Los Angeles 
rock giants' promotional push and the sale of KKZZ and KHJJ. Barbara Halley, 
manager of sister stations KTPI-FM and KVOY-AM, believes that she has the local 
country music audience securely in hand. Although Los Angeles has country 
stations, their signals don't reach the Antelope Valley clearly, she says. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're listening to FM country in the Antelope Valley, you're listening to 
us because we're the only one," Halley said. "I can see where a rock station 
would be threatened." 
</P>
<P>
KTPI and KVOY don't offer local news coverage, but, unlike KUTY, they use local 
disc jockeys. 
</P>
<P>
Halley said her stations get new residents to tune in with a busy remote 
broadcast schedule. The stations broadcast and gave away prizes last summer at 
about 50 locations, ranging from a recreational vehicle show to a new housing 
tract to a meat market. For $1,400, an advertiser gets the remote broadcast, 
assorted prizes given away to listeners and 50 radio commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Although Halley believes country is the key market in Antelope Valley, rock 
station manager Thornhill argues that the region's new residents are bringing 
their urban musical tastes with them. "We have nothing to prove that country 
music is No. 1 out here anymore," he said. "Times have changed. We're not a 
country, rural area anymore." 
</P>
<P>
All the local broadcasters believe the Antelope Valley's radio market is 
changing. Advertisers and listeners have become more sophisticated, and local 
stations are looking for new ways to keep the L.A. giants at bay. 
</P>
<P>
Thornhill said rising ad rates may cause local stations to lose their small 
mom-and-pop store accounts in favor of more lucrative chain-store contracts. 
Broadcasts of Antelope Valley high school and college football games may be 
dropped because they don't attract enough listeners, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge is to connect with a large segment of the local audience, while 
working with limited resources. Thornhill boasted that his stations recently 
coaxed their listeners into donating $54,000 for San Francisco earthquake 
relief in less than 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't fight with Los Angeles," he said. "You can't fight with Rick Dees. 
You've just got to do the best that you can."

VALLEY LIGHT OPERA COMPANY ORGANIZING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The long line of showmen who have announced plans to bring major musical 
theater productions to the San Fernando Valley has a new entry. 
</P>
<P>
David Hock, a Sherman Oaks-based producer, choreographer and dance teacher, has 
announced the formation of Valley Civic Light Opera and his plans to stage at 
least two musicals a year. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no culture in the Valley. You just can't find it here and that is 
ridiculous," Hock said in explaining why he founded VCLO, whose nonprofit 
status is pending. "There is not one professional performing arts association. 
You can't see a professional show in the Valley. The need is substantial." 
</P>
<P>
Hock's planned cultural contribution is "Guys and Dolls," which he hopes to 
stage at Cal State Northridge's Campus Theatre in December for a three-week 
run, followed by "Man of La Mancha" in June, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Hock concedes he has a long way to go before VCLO gets a show on the boards. He 
estimates the first production will cost about $200,000, none of which has been 
raised. Through a fund-raiser and foundation grants, he hopes to raise at least 
$75,000 by July. 
</P>
<P>
"Our anticipated ticket sales will make up the rest of the costs," he said. "We 
will have no trouble selling out with the kind of stars I plan to put into the 
shows." 
</P>
<P>
Hock declined to discuss exactly which stars he hopes to hire, but he said they 
are "on the same level of a Juliet Prowse," who is currently starring in the 
Long Beach Civic Light Opera production of "Follies." 
</P>
<P>
One of his problems was finding an appropriate theater for the venture. "There 
are no theaters large enough for musicals that are properly equipped," Hock 
said. He settled on the 400-seat Campus Theatre with hopes to move on to the 
long-proposed performing arts center at CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
Hock has never before run a theater company. His last theatrical credit was as 
the producer of the 1987 touring one-woman show, "Musical Feat." He heads a 
Sherman Oaks-based dance company, Silver Lining, and teaches tap. 
</P>
<P>
The last time large-scale musicals played the Valley on a regular basis was at 
a 2,800-seat theater-in-the-round in Woodland Hills. The Valley Music Center, 
as it was called, opened in 1964 with a production of "The Sound of Music," 
followed by such shows as "Guys and Dolls," "South Pacific," "The Sound of 
Music," "Oklahoma!" and "Camelot." The theater also featured such non-musical 
offerings as Shirley Booth in "Come Back, Little Sheba," Charlton Heston in "A 
Man for All Seasons" and even Judith Anderson in "Medea." 
</P>
<P>
But Valley Music Center went bankrupt after only two years. The building is now 
owned by the Jehovah's Witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Since then several groups in the Valley have announced plans to stage 
professional musicals in revamped movie theaters and other large venues, but 
none of the plans has come to fruition.

BANDS LURE GIGS BY GRASPING AT ODDBALL NAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE O'NEILL and O'Neill is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A glance at a San Fernando Valley music calendar says it all: Today's vogue 
band names can come from just about anywhere and mean just about anything, or 
nothing. The only prerequisite is that they evoke emotion -- be it laughter, 
curiosity or even serious thought -- anything that will garner attention in the 
highly competitive field of local, live music. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for instance, the San Fernando Valley-based blues band B. B. Chun King 
and the Screaming Buddha Heads. Manager Kerry Lewis said promoting the group is 
made easier "because no one ever forgets the name." 
</P>
<P>
Alan Mirikitani, the band's leader and a Japanese-American, said he wanted an 
aggressive sounding name that would counter the "quiet and courteous" 
stereotype society often attaches to Asians. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, he was planning on naming the band simply "Screaming Buddha Heads." 
But a friend mentioned that he sounded like Blues singer B. B. King -- or 
rather, his friend quipped, B. B. Chun King. 
</P>
<P>
"And I said, 'Hey! That works,' " Mirikitani recalled with a laugh. Most 
everyone, he said, is intrigued by the name. 
</P>
<P>
"When people first hear the name, they giggle and go, 'Oh, really?' " 
Mirikitani said. "Then they say they've got to see us." 
</P>
<P>
And that's the name of the game in today's music world, according to Ken 
Fusion, local music director for KROQ-FM (106.7) in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Fusion said bands with extra-odd names have become the norm around the local 
club scene, whether the band plays blues, rock or country. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's done essentially to call attention to the particular band," 
Fusion said. "There are so many bands in town that they often get overlooked. 
So, by giving themselves outrageous names, maybe people will check them out." 
</P>
<P>
What follows is a sampling of bands that frequent the Palomino, FM Station Live 
and other Valley nightspots. 
</P>
<P>
Rhino Bucket: An evening of drunken bliss generated the name for this Van 
Nuys-based heavy metal band, said lead singer George Dolivo. 
</P>
<P>
"We were thinking of names, and we had a few too many beers one night, and we 
were shouting out words and phrases, like 'rhino' and 'bucket of lard,' " 
Dolivo said. "Then someone yelled, 'rhino bucket' as a joke and we all fell to 
the floor, cracking up." 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, a booking agent called with a gig. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to come up with a name right then, so I gave him 'Rhino Bucket,' and it 
stuck," Dolivo said. 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, few in the heavy metal circuit would take the band seriously 
because its name didn't fit the stereotypical heavy-metal mold. 
</P>
<P>
"It is kind of a weird name for a heavy metal band," Dolivo conceded. "Everyone 
expected us to be called something like 'Predator.' " 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, Rhino Bucket is now accepted and the band members like the 
freedom the moniker gives them in coming up with the band logo, which -- 
appropriately enough -- is a leather-clad rhinoceros toasting with a beer. 
</P>
<P>
Monkey Meet: This band plays "upwardly mobile funk-a-go-go" or "darn near 
anything but country and polkas," said band member Renard Luke. But ask him 
what the name means, and he's at a loss to answer. 
</P>
<P>
Monkey Meet manager Clark Lough offered a little more insight. 
</P>
<P>
"It really doesn't have any meaning to the band," he said. "It's just a wacky, 
fun name." 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Duncan's Eye: None of the members in this original-rock band remembers 
who thought up the name or, for that matter, why. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't know. At the time we thought of it, she wasn't even on TV," said 
Campbell Emory, drummer. "She has a glass eye, I think. I know one of her eyes 
is somehow different from the other, which makes her unique." 
</P>
<P>
But such uncertainty surrounding the band's name hasn't hurt its appeal. In 
fact, Emory said, the group recently finished a Seattle gig that was offered to 
it solely because of the name. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't even have to send a tape," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Emory said that, as far as he knows, the band's namesake is unaware of the 
group's existence: "So we're enjoying our freedom while it lasts." 
</P>
<P>
Monster Island: This traditional rock 'n' roll band gets its name from a movie 
that features a collection of those famous Japanese monsters, said bass player 
Kevin Mueller. 
</P>
<P>
"It was sort of like a giant playground," Mueller said of the movie. 
</P>
<P>
The band's motto plays off the theme, "When you're a monster, the whole world's 
your playground." 
</P>
<P>
The name generally draws praise, Mueller said, but it also draws criticism from 
heavy-metal aficionados who consider it better-suited for their own music. No 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically those who understand the name -- that it's a band of guys having fun 
-- they realize how it fits." 
</P>
<P>
Young Guns: This hard-rock group, by contrast, does not get its name from the 
recent brat-pack movie of the same name, according to band member Drew Hannah. 
</P>
<P>
"The name's been with us for a long, long time," Hannah said. 
</P>
<P>
Young Guns formed about five years ago, but Hannah and the band's guitarist 
have been playing music together since they were children in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
"We were a bunch of little kids in a band and our parents started calling us 
'Young Guns,' " Hannah said. 
</P>
<P>
Trailer Park Casanovas: Although his parents had no part in naming the band, 
stand-up bass player Steve Neal said that hometown heritage, specifically a 
Midwestern upbringing, played a role in this country-rock band's name. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Midwest, trailer parks are a kind of art form," he said. "I lived in 
one when I was younger, and they're sort of a community in themselves, where 
the people are a little different." 
</P>
<P>
It is hoped, Neal said, that the unusualness will rub off on his band. 
</P>
<P>
Lypswitch: Bass player Kevin Agosta said the name comes from a street sign in 
Orlando, Fla., where the band got its start two years ago. Members describe 
their music as "underground punk-funk-street rock." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Agosta said, the band has been well-received. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people think it's really cool and original, and that makes us feel 
really good," Agosta said. 
</P>
<P>
Those same people often debate its meaning. 
</P>
<P>
"They say it doesn't mean this and it doesn't mean that," Agosta said. "We just 
leave it open and let people decide for themselves what it means." 
</P>
<P>
And what might that be? 
</P>
<P>
Answered Agosta: "It doesn't really mean anything." 
</P>
<P>
Momma Stud: This band features "psychedelic funky soul." Guitar player Krany 
Crews said the name came from a "crazy acquaintance who just made it up." 
</P>
<P>
It worked, he said, because it incorporated a reference to maternalism. 
</P>
<P>
"Mother is Earth," Crews explained. "Mother is everything." 
</P>
<P>
Sure. OK. But Stud?

BONHOMIE COMPENSATES FOR KITCHEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Where do two restless, hungry, dressed-up single women want to go on a Thursday 
night in Sherman Oaks? Stanley's, of course. Kate and I drive over, only to 
find that all the other dressed-up restless have beaten us there. Stanley's is 
so crowded that we are asked to wait outside until the inside waiting room 
becomes available. 
</P>
<P>
It's too cold to stand around in nylons and miniskirts, and we're too restless, 
so we take a walk and find ourselves down the street at Cafe Cordiale, which is 
also doing a spirited business. There's no wait, we're told, for the smoking 
section. We're too hungry to pass it up. Moments later, we have a warm table 
and are busy filling up on hunks of hot Italian bread. 
</P>
<P>
The decor is a little corporate -- pink linens, gray walls, store-bought 
posters: Cafe Cordiale most resembles an upscale, trendy coffee shop. Its menu 
reads like an encyclopedia of every '80s food trend: pasta, pizza, dim sum, 
satay, risotto, blackened this 'n' that, Maui onions . . . . There's a bar 
here, too, and a lounge area, and, although there are two women sipping white 
wine and a lone man with an algae-green Midori, I don't sense much of a bar 
scene. Still, Cafe Cordiale is a very comfortable, casual . . . cordial 
restaurant with a lively mixture of people of all ages. 
</P>
<P>
At our little table, squeezed between two other tables along a banquette, we 
are so close to our neighbors that we can't help but overhear their 
conversations. On one side is a complainer: "I hate the takeout food you find 
these days." On the other side is a confider: "I was crazy for him," she says. 
Reading the diverse menu, let alone conducting our own conversation, requires 
great concentration. 
</P>
<P>
As eclectic and trendy as the menu appears to be, the food at Cafe Cordiale is 
more familiar than not, and often very ordinary. The mixed green salad isn't, 
for example, mixed greens: Except for a token shred of radicchio, there's 
nothing but good old romaine in it -- no oak leaf lettuce, no mesclun, no trace 
of lettuce infanticide. The cream of asparagus soup is a thick puree with a few 
stringy stalk-ends of asparagus floating in it. Our favorite appetizer is the 
fried dumplings: Light and well-spiced, they come with a head-clearing mustard 
and a snappy sweet-and-sour sauce. 
</P>
<P>
A pasta special, angel hair with chicken breast, asparagus and mushrooms, is 
winy and pretty good except that, again, the asparagus is all stalk -- I find 
one nubbly tip section in the whole dish. Kate's sauteed shrimp are garlicky 
and cooked to hardness, but she has a swell time dipping the garlic bread in 
the butter and cream sauce. After-dinner cappuccinos are very good. 
</P>
<P>
When we return for lunch a few days later, burgers with fries and salads in big 
glass bowls are rolling out of the kitchen as fast as the waitress can carry 
them. Of the blackened swordfish salad, which comes with butter, lettuce and 
more asparagus stalk, Kate says: "I'd come in and eat this any time." The veal 
and turkeyburger is hefty and well-dressed with perfectly grilled Maui onions. 
On the other hand, a risotto, made with basmati rice, is inedible: Coated with 
tomato sauce and melted mozzarella, it tastes like rice pizza or, more 
accurately, like dried oregano, of which it contains handfuls. 
</P>
<P>
The service is rushed at times. But the waitresses, even as we nag them for 
butter, ice water, salad dressing, are staunchly good-natured. 
</P>
<P>
If I think of Cafe Cordiale as a fun, unusual, better-than-average coffee shop, 
I don't mind the lapses in cooking so much. It's a good, basic, friendly place 
to go for a bite to eat, to be among fellow humans, to seek refuge when there's 
no admittance to the hot spot up the street. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended dishes: fried dumplings, $4.95; blackened swordfish salad, $9.95; 
veal and turkeyburger, $7.25. 
</P>
<P>
 Cafe Cordiale, 14015 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks. (818) 789-1985. Open for 
breakfast 9 to 11:30 a.m. Saturdays and 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Sundays; lunch 11 a.m.

L.A. AWAKENING TO LOW-COST HOUSING CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Councilman Hal Bernson was puzzling one recent day over a proposal to 
charge big commercial developers a fee that would be used to construct 
low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson could not understand why a program was created to build apartments for 
the poor, when so many middle-class people faced housing problems too. 
Disturbed, he promised to "look into the idea" of who should benefit from such 
a program. 
</P>
<P>
Confusion among elected officials over what appear to them to be odd, 
newfangled ideas for addressing the city's housing crisis permeates City Hall 
these days. 
</P>
<P>
Charging "extraction" fees to developers is actually a proven financing method 
that, since the early 1980s, has paid for thousands of low-cost rental units in 
Boston, San Francisco, Washington and other big cities. 
</P>
<P>
But in Los Angeles, elected officials concede, they are just beginning to 
tinker with these and other strategies for resolving the city's housing 
affordability crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Because it lacks a formal housing policy, Los Angeles has only in recent weeks 
created a "public-private partnership" of housing experts who will draw in 
public and private funds to build low-cost housing without the constraints of 
government paper work. Such groups have racked up dramatic successes for many 
years in New York and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Dade County, Fla., has raised more than $50 million for low-income housing 
through real estate transfer fees since the mid-1980s, and similar programs 
exist in New Jersey and Maine. But without an agency assigned to investigate 
and promote these ideas, Los Angeles officials are only now beginning to 
discuss similar fees. 
</P>
<P>
This week Mayor Tom Bradley announced a plan that could resolve the persistent 
lack of direction that has left the city so far behind other urban areas. He 
proposed the creation of a housing commission and a new Housing Department that 
would take on increasingly complex duties that the City Council has been unable 
to perform. 
</P>
<P>
Although the extent of the power to be granted to the new commission has yet to 
be worked out, most officials say they expect it to act much like the Planning 
Commission, ironing out the nitty-gritty details of new programs before 
bringing recommendations to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said it is hoped that this will overcome the problem of 11 different 
departments bringing before the council complex programs that were difficult 
for elected officials to assess or reshape. 
</P>
<P>
Sydney Irmas, chairman of Bradley's blue-ribbon committee on affordable 
housing, which has urged creation of a housing commission since 1988, applauded 
the mayor's proposal saying: "This is something we have to do. Right now, the 
housing effort is a black hole where ideas go in, but not a hell of a lot comes 
back out." 
</P>
<P>
Irmas said a "bureaucratic nightmare" has crippled the city's 
affordable-housing efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"The city has 11 agencies overseeing housing, and if you graded them they would 
get from an F to a C plus," Irmas said. "All of these departments are capable 
of improving dramatically if they are pushed by this new agency proposed by the 
mayor." 
</P>
<P>
But the job of the new agency and the commission will be daunting. 
</P>
<P>
According to city reports, 60% of Los Angeles is made up of renters, one-third 
of whom live in units that the federal government considers "unaffordable" 
because rent eats up more than 30% of the family income. City officials say 
40,000 families live in garages, 35,000 are homeless, including thousands of 
children, and the poor generally pay more than 50% of their meager incomes for 
rent. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in the next few years, federal rent restrictions will be lifted on 
25,000 apartment units citywide, and officials fear a surge in homelessness as 
landlords raise rents, driving out the poor. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed department -- which must be approved by the council -- would 
absorb the 120 employees and most duties of the Community Development 
Department's housing division. City officials expect to add a general manager, 
plus a small staff for the appointed seven-member commission, but those changes 
are not expected to strain the city budget, said Michael Bodaken, Bradley's 
recently appointed housing coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews with housing experts and elected officials this week, a consensus 
emerged that, despite the potential that the move could create a new layer of 
bureaucracy, the mayor's plan is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
"The council doesn't have time for daily oversight," said Councilwoman Joan 
Milke Flores, one of the few council members knowledgeable about affordable 
housing issues. "When it comes to housing, we have not been very open to 
listening, and have just told (city housing directors) to go ahead and do it, 
and don't mess up." 
</P>
<P>
"We have money to use, and we have a crisis, and somehow it's not connecting," 
said Councilwoman Gloria Molina, an expert on affordable housing and chairwoman 
of the council's Housing Committee. "It all goes back to poor management, and 
the mayor claims it can be turned around, and I honestly hope it can be." 
</P>
<P>
One group that she and other housing advocates believe will gain significant 
new clout under the new system is nonprofit developers. These small, 
community-based groups have begun building low-income housing in downtrodden 
Los Angeles neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
In Chicago, Cleveland and many other cities, nonprofit developers have long 
been "an arm of city government" because of their unique ability to build 
inexpensive housing and maintain low rents indefinitely, said a housing expert. 
</P>
<P>
"Nonprofits are really the key to answering many of these problems, and that 
hasn't been recognized by Los Angeles," said Anita Landecker, of Local 
Initiatives Support Corp., a Ford Foundation spinoff that finances nonprofit 
developers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Only recently has the city's Community Development Department, under pressure 
from Molina and housing advocates, supported the idea of assisting nonprofit 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
Parker Anderson, director of the CDD, said the agency will soon ask the council 
to approve $5.5 million in loans to 11 nonprofit developers to pay for 
architectural design, site preparation and "gap financing" that makes up for 
shortfalls in loans from traditional lenders. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said the money, for which nonprofits applied last November, "is just 
one example of the very aggressive programming we have this year." 
</P>
<P>
But most city officials and housing experts interviewed this week said the 
nonprofit program -- and the long delay since November in actually getting any 
loans out -- is proof of the city's inability to move quickly under its current 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great idea, but it's six years late, no developers have gotten a penny 
since it was announced in November, and some of our projects had to be 
abandoned," said one nonprofit developer, who asked not to be named. "The CDD 
responds like a bureaucracy, not a business, and housing doesn't get built that 
way."

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE WARNS CITY TO MOVE ON HOUSING FOR 
ELDERLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge sternly warned the city of Hidden Hills on 
Thursday that it must proceed with a court-ordered lower-cost housing plan for 
senior citizens, but stopped short of holding the city in contempt of court. 
</P>
<P>
Judge R. William Schoettler, Jr. said he is prepared to order City Council 
members into court and keep them there "eight hours a day, five days a week" 
until they approve the housing plan. 
</P>
<P>
Schoettler did not hold the city in contempt but left open the possibility, 
saying he would enforce a Feb. 5, 1992, deadline for construction to start. 
</P>
<P>
The city was plunged into controversy last year when the City Council supported 
a plan for 46 units of senior housing on land annexed from the county. The 
project was part of a court order issued by Schoettler last July, when the city 
agreed to settle a lawsuit by the county and a private attorney over the city's 
formation of a redevelopment agency to fund a flood-control project.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 3.0 QUAKE JOLTS AREA BUT NO INJURIES, DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A small earthquake jolted parts of the Los Angeles metropolitan area early 
Thursday but there were no reports of serious injury or damage. 
</P>
<P>
The 3.0-magnitude temblor struck at 3:03 a.m. and was centered two miles west 
of Highland Park, said Bob Finn, spokesman for Caltech in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The quake was felt downtown and in Hollywood, Glendale and Pasadena. But 
seismologists said it was not related to last week's 5.5-magnitude Upland 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Finn said a 3.5-magnitude quake that struck at 10:25 p.m. Wednesday was an 
aftershock of the Upland quake and was centered about four miles 
north-northeast of suburban Pomona. No damage was reported.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAYOR BANS RECYCLABLE TRASH FROM LANDFILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley on Thursday told Bureau of Sanitation officials 
not to put any trash separated for recycling into landfills, after at least one 
city contractor said some glass may have to be dumped because the market cannot 
accept all of the glass being generated in the city's pilot recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor, in a memo to the Board of Public Works and Bureau of Sanitation 
officials, said putting material into landfills that was meant to be recycled 
could "undermine (public) support for the curbside recycling program we have 
launched for 720,000 households in the city."

HEAD OF SOUTH-CENTRAL GANG-FIGHTING AGENCY ASSAILS LACK OF MONEY; 
</P>
<P>
INNER CITY: HE SAYS MOST OF THE FUNDING GOES TO AREAS WHERE PROBLEM IS LESS 
SEVERE. HIS OWN YOUTH ORGANIZATION MAY HAVE TO CLOSE DOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The operator of an anti-gang agency alleged Thursday that his and other 
South-Central Los Angeles organizations get only a small fraction of government 
money allocated to fight gangs, even though South-Central has what authorities 
say is the county's worst gang problem. 
</P>
<P>
Chilton Alphonse, director of the Community Youth Sports and Arts Foundation, 
said at a news conference that many small South-Central-based groups that fight 
gangs must struggle to make ends meet. At the same time, agencies based in 
areas where gang problems are not as severe -- such as East Los Angeles and the 
South Bay -- are operating on multimillion-dollar budgets. 
</P>
<P>
Alphonse said his agency is on the brink of closing for lack of money -- a 
fate, he said, that is shared by several other youth- oriented agencies in 
South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
Directors of some of those agencies contacted Thursday agreed with Alphonse's 
assessment. 
</P>
<P>
Only one grass-roots, anti-gang agency in South-Central Los Angeles gets money 
from Gov. George Deukmejian's Office of Criminal Justice Planning, those 
directors said. They added that the lion's share of city and county anti-gang 
funds is allocated to the East Los Angeles-based Community Youth Gang Services. 
</P>
<P>
"The money goes to outlying areas. It's as if we don't exist here," said Leon 
Watkins, who operates a South-Central telephone hot line that, among other 
things, aids youths who want to get out of gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"We exist when they need somebody to help people," he said, "but not when it 
comes to getting money." 
</P>
<P>
Money for agencies such as Alphonse's and Watkins' generally is allocated by 
the county Board of Supervisors, the City Council and the state criminal 
justice office. 
</P>
<P>
G. Albert Howenstein Jr., executive director of the criminal justice office, 
said the problem at the state level is not unfair distribution of money, but 
not enough money to go around. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a limited amount of money available from the state, therefore we must 
allocate it on a competitive basis," Howenstein said in a statement read by an 
aide. "We can only evaluate and award the dollars based on the criteria . . . 
established by the Legislature." 
</P>
<P>
Howenstein's office allocated about $5 million for anti-gang programs statewide 
last year, the aide said. About half of that money went to Los Angeles County, 
she said, but a detailed breakdown was not available. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Valdivia, director of Community Youth Gang Services, agreed that the 
problem is one of insufficient money all around. He said he is not to blame for 
the funding problems at other agencies, adding that they compete for available 
money just as he does. 
</P>
<P>
Valdivia also noted that two-thirds of his field workers are employed in and 
around South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
County officials could not be reached to respond to Alphonse's contentions. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Nate Holden said most small agencies lack the expertise to 
write proposals that could get them a larger share of the pie. 
</P>
<P>
Alphonse said his agency needs about $400,000 annually to operate, but so far 
this year expects to receive only about $102,000 from the city to run the 
agency's alternative school, its recreation and enrichment programs and 
twice-weekly classes for parents of youths at risk of becoming involved in 
gangs. 
</P>
<P>
His agency is already $50,000 in debt, Alphonse said, and will have to close 
its doors unless it receives at least that amount in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Alphonse noted that, in contrast to his organization's funding, Community Youth 
Gang Services receives more than $2 million annually through contracts with 
city and county government. And a South Bay-based anti-gang program, he said, 
has been allocated $1.9 million from the state. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins said he has received no direct government money to run his telephone 
hot line in the four years it has existed, even though he said he has applied 
for every grant he was aware of. However, his $1,600-a-month salary is paid 
under a subcontract with Community Youth Gang Services. 
</P>
<P>
V. G. Guinses said his 20-year-old Save Every Youngster Youth Enterprise 
Society, receives more government money -- $400,000 annually from the state -- 
than any other grass-roots agency in South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, he said, he often feels he has been given "a water pistol to put out a 
forest fire."

LAST ORIGINAL LAPD 'MOUNTIE' TROTS OUT THE MEMORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Joe Dircks steadied himself, grabbed the horn of the saddle and swung over the 
horse. 
</P>
<P>
It had been 64 years since Dircks wore police blue and rode with the mounted 
patrol. And now, the last surviving member of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's original mounted patrol was being feted on the day after his 90th 
birthday by officers who have followed in his path. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot of memories," Dircks said Thursday after a surprise birthday 
party at the Ahmanson Equestrian Center in the Atwater district. "There are so 
many things, but what I miss the most is the association of my fellow officers. 
I'm honored." 
</P>
<P>
When Dircks last served the city on horseback, downtown Los Angeles was as safe 
as any neighborhood. He saw Prohibition come and go and smog come and stay. He 
witnessed the completion of the Coliseum and hobnobbed with the rich and 
famous. 
</P>
<P>
Dircks was a young man of "220 pounds of muscle" when he joined the mounted 
patrol in 1923. Los Angeles was grappling with phenomenal growth, but it was 
still a relatively safe town, a time when characters like "Penal Code" Reagan 
and "Postman Smith" hung around the corner of 5th Street and Grand Avenue and 
the Gypsies camped along the banks of the Los Angeles River. 
</P>
<P>
"Things were very mild then compared to the way they are now," he said. "About 
the most exciting thing that happened to us was overtime parking." 
</P>
<P>
A native of Stratton, Colo., Dircks moved to Los Angeles at the age of 19 and 
four years later joined the police mounted patrol, which was then used 
primarily to catch parking violators and to control crowds at gala Hollywood 
film premieres. 
</P>
<P>
With a chestnut quarter horse named Bob, Dircks patrolled Grand Avenue between 
5th and 9th streets. It was while on patrol that he met his future wife, 
Lillie, the sister of a parking lot attendant. They have been married 66 years. 
</P>
<P>
The mounted unit was disbanded in 1926 because of what Dircks called "a 
political thing." 
</P>
<P>
"We had this sergeant who gave the head of the Police Commission a lot of 
tickets for parking in an alley over between Main and Spring," he said. "The 
guy had some kind of business over there. He told the sergeant to stop but he 
didn't. Sure enough in a matter of two or three weeks they disbanded the 
mounted squad." 
</P>
<P>
Even with parking fines costing only $2 then, Dircks said the chief of the 
Police Commission expected favors. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd do it all the time," he said. "We'd have roll call and someone would say, 
'My friend got a ticket,' and you tore it up. The city didn't get much money 
but you made a lot of friends." 
</P>
<P>
Dircks and Bob became something of a celebrity twosome on the beat. Dircks 
would eat at the Biltmore while Bob would beg for treats from passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd stand out front of the Biltmore and kick his hoofs until the girls came 
out and gave him sugar," he said. "If you could go there today, on the Grand 
Avenue side, I bet you'd see where he beat on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob was a fine horse. He was really more like a mule than anything else. He 
ate a lot. He used to walk behind me and sneak two apples from a fruit stand. 
No, really he was more like a dog than a horse. Like my dog I have right now, 
he'll do anything to please you." 
</P>
<P>
Dircks said the city he knew as a young officer was "full of characters, and I 
remember them all. We had one guy we called 'Penal Code' Reagan because he 
could recite the entire penal code by heart. There was a postman who used to 
give the horses Smith Bros. cough drops, so we call him 'Postman Smith.' It was 
a fine city then. Only 350,000 people when I got there." 
</P>
<P>
Dircks said his most dangerous incident came in a close encounter with a 
prizefighter who was angry because Dircks had arrested his girlfriend. There 
was another drunk who hurled $20 gold pieces at him, but he didn't encounter 
"anything like the problems" officers face today. 
</P>
<P>
After the mounted patrol was disbanded, Dircks went on to help establish the 
department's first shooting range. He retired from the Police Department as a 
lieutenant in 1943, about the time "we started getting some smog," and went to 
work for Douglas Aircraft in Long Beach as head of security. 
</P>
<P>
The city's mounted patrol unit was brought back in July, 1981, and is used 
extensively for crowd control and patrol duty, much as it was in Dircks' day. 
</P>
<P>
It had been 10 years since Dircks was on the back of a horse, but Thursday he 
mounted an LAPD horse and took a final ride around the ring with a special 
honor guard. 
</P>
<P>
When it was over, he slowly dismounted and took off a black ceremonial cowboy 
hat adorned with a silver police badge. 
</P>
<P>
"You know," he said finally, "as you grow older you don't remember the things 
that weren't so pleasant. You remember the good things. It's better that way."

3 DUARTE CAR DEALERSHIPS IN BANKRUPTCY CLOSE THEIR DOORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Duarte Nissan Inc., which owns three dealerships in the city's 210 Freeway 
Autoplex, shut its doors this week, less than two months after filing for 
protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
</P>
<P>
Gates to the sprawling facility were locked Thursday. Car models were still on 
display in the showrooms and outside. 
</P>
<P>
Two security guards posted near the entrance said the business had been shut 
down since Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The closure apparently prevented customers from picking up their cars. 
</P>
<P>
Basile Georgescu of Tujunga said Thursday he has tried for the last 12 days to 
retrieve the $7,700 used car he bought in February and left to be serviced. 
Georgescu said he was told by officials of Tokai Credit Corp., Duarte Nissan's 
major creditor, that he'd have to go to federal court to get his car back. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Cecil Erwin, area commander for the investigation 
section of the state Department of Motor Vehicles' inland office, said the 
agency is investigating complaints from Duarte Nissan customers about improper 
title transfers and misrepresentation by salespeople. He would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for Duarte Nissan, Robert Mayer, confirmed the dealership's 
closure. But he referred other questions to the owner, Bruce Low. Neither Low 
nor other company officials could be reached Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte Nissan -- which includes Nissan, Isuzu and Suzuki dealerships -- had 
remained open since it filed for reorganization of its debts and protection 
from creditors under Chapter 11 in January, Duarte City Manager Jesse Duff 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview two months ago, Low said the dealership's financial troubles 
stemmed from a suit against one of its creditors, but he would not elaborate. 
Low said about 10 employees, mostly salespeople, were laid off when the company 
filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Auto sales had surged since the businesses moved to the Autoplex in Duarte. 
Last year, 5,000 models were sold for a total of $60 million, compared with 
2,500 in 1988, when the firm was in Arcadia, Low said in January. 
</P>
<P>
The three dealerships generated $300,000 of Duarte's $1.65 million in sales tax 
revenue last year. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-year-old Autoplex is on 47 acres near the Foothill Freeway on the 
Duarte-Monrovia border. The Autoplex has 10 spaces for dealerships, five of 
which are occupied. 
</P>
<P>
When fully occupied, it was expected to generate $2 million to $3 million in 
annual sales tax revenue for the city, which had contributed $7.5 million to 
the project.

VOTE ON WHO WILL POLICE LIGHT RAIL LINE POSTPONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Following a protest from their own transit police, the Southern California 
Rapid Transit District Board of Directors on Thursday put off for two weeks any 
decision on whether to hire Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies to protect 
the Long Beach-Los Angeles Light Rail Line. 
</P>
<P>
The board had voted 9 to 2 a month ago to have its own transit police force 
handle security on the 22-mile trolley line that will begin running between 
downtown Los Angeles and Long Beach in July. Called the Blue Line, these 
trolleys will be the first to operate in Los Angeles in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
The directors met Thursday to reconsider this vote after strong political 
pressure from the mayor's office, the county Board of Supervisors and others 
who favor use of the sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
The board, after three hours of argument and protests from 50 RTD police 
officers, decided to put the vote off until its next meeting, March 22. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission has built the $871-million 
line and will turn rail operations over to the RTD this summer. Saying they 
fear the RTD police could not handle security, the commission staff has tried 
to force the RTD to hire the sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Line, which will link downtown Los Angeles to Long Beach, runs through 
high-crime areas in South-Central Los Angeles that are also plagued by gangs. 
Rail experts from both agencies agree that the line's success depends upon 
riders feeling safe enough to board the trains. 
</P>
<P>
After the RTD board voted Feb. 8 to give the security job to RTD police, 
political pressure was applied by both Mayor Tom Bradley's office and the 
supervisors to reverse the decision, several RTD board members said Thursday. 
The mayor and individual supervisors appoint seven of the 11 members of the RTD 
board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
RTD board members Nick Patsaouras and Larry Gonzales -- working behind the 
scenes with the Transportation Commission staff, representatives from the 
mayor's office and the supervisors' staff -- fashioned a proposed two-year 
contract that would give Blue Line security to the sheriff's office. At the end 
of that period, the RTD could cancel the contract. 
</P>
<P>
The $9.9-million-a-year contract called for deployment of a special force of 
126 deputies, investigators and supervisors to police the line, according to 
Sheriff's Lt. Jerry Schmiedeke. Cost of the contract would be paid by the 
Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, the RTD police force has been understaffed and torn by morale 
problems, commission executive director Neal Peterson has said. He said an 
opinion poll paid for by the commission revealed potential train riders have 
more confidence in the sheriff's office. 
</P>
<P>
However, Sharon Papa, the new RTD police chief, has assured the board that her 
department can handle security on the Blue Line and at less cost. She has been 
hiring and training new officers for the job. The cost, she said, would be 
about $6 million, a savings of about $4 million for comparable service. 
</P>
<P>
At noon Thursday, before the RTD board meeting, about 50 RTD officers in 
uniform held a press conference to protest the proposed contract with the 
sheriff's office. 
</P>
<P>
And half a dozen officers testified during the stormy session, contending that 
their small department was being squeezed out in a power grab by the sheriff's 
office.

AT THE GALLERIES: WORKS THAT GIVE BEAUTIFUL SHAPE TO SOUND; 
</P>
<P>
ART: MIRIAM SIEVERS' INTERPRETATIONS OF MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS EVOKE BOTH THE 
SKELETON AND SOUL OF MUSIC THROUGH THE BAREST OF MEANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Through extended, long, drawn-out, somewhat expressionless, unsympathetic 
tones of a bassoon, resounding in the empty depths, everything became green," 
wrote Wassily Kandinsky, probing the affinity between music and art, between 
intangible sounds and abstract forms, colors and shapes. 
</P>
<P>
Miriam Sievers, a San Diego artist, gracefully extends this dialogue between 
sister tongues. In her current show at Palomar College's Boehm Gallery (1140 W. 
Mission Road, San Marcos), she gives sculptural shape to sound and to its 
source. Filled with her free-standing, hanging and wall-mounted works, the 
gallery becomes a workshop where instruments lie in wait, their raw wood bones 
and gray felt skins exposed to the air's caress. At the same time, these forms 
for making music evoke sounds themselves -- notes suspended in space, measured 
beats, wavelike rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
Literal, intuitive and sensual responses to music coalesce with subtle beauty 
in Sievers' work. Her interpretation of the bassoon builds on Kandinsky's: A 
dark wood post stands staidly upon a geometric base, while a thin steel rod 
meanders northward beside it -- a prolonged wail. The counterpoint of tones and 
that of forms become one here, and the architecture of the base doubles as the 
structural foundation of the freely floating sounds. 
</P>
<P>
Sievers' is an art of omission and implication. Both the skeleton and the soul 
of music are evoked through the barest of means -- delicate planes of wood, 
brass fittings, felt, steel and air. In "Call," another thick dark rod of wood, 
ending in a metal horn, rests horizontally on a wood shelf. Inches above, a 
slender steel rod hangs in a slight arc, embodying the horn's persistent call. 
</P>
<P>
Sievers' work visualizes the invisible in plainly but carefully crafted forms. 
Time asserts a viable presence as one follows the slow, dipping curves and 
staccato geometries of the work. Understated and highly accomplished, Sievers' 
work bridges the worlds of sight and sound with a profound respect for the 
idioms of each. 
</P>
<P>
The delicate spell of Sievers' work is broken with a dull and muddy thud by a 
group of paintings in the adjoining gallery space. 
</P>
<P>
The "Game Series," by local painter Gail Roberts, aspires to critique our 
wasteful, detritus-producing society, according to the artist's statement. She 
pairs painted scenes of unsullied landscapes with checkerboards, rubber balls, 
marbles and other plastic toys. Occasionally she melds these objects to the 
surface of the canvas, painting rocks or other undefined landscape elements 
directly over them. 
</P>
<P>
Does our regard for the earth resemble children's play, with its simple, stated 
rules, its carefree appeal, its irrelevant consequences? In the worst of cases, 
perhaps yes, but Roberts fails to elucidate the relationship between the 
landscape and the game in a convincing manner. Her view is dark and critical 
but vague. 
</P>
<P>
Two smaller works deviate from the rest and show more promise. In both "Wings" 
and "Signing," latex-cast hands with clenched fists, splayed fingers or cupped 
palms are embedded in the painted surface. Though they gesture and signal, 
their confinement there paralyzes them and renders them mute. Thwarted 
communication works effectively here as a theme; in Roberts' other works, 
however, it's an unintended result. 
</P>
<P>
Both shows continue through March 14.

'PARTY OF ONE' BASED ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Morris Bobrow has something good to say about being single at 50. 
</P>
<P>
It inspired him to write "Party of One," the long running San Francisco hit 
that will be produced by the Gaslamp Quarter Theatre at The Elizabeth North 
Theatre on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It occurred to me that there was no musical comedy that had been written about 
being single," said the San Francisco native, who flew into town to give advice 
to the Gaslamp on its production. 
</P>
<P>
The show clearly filled some kind of void in San Francisco, where it is now in 
its fourth year at the Zephyr Theater. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of ideas were gleaned from male or female friends about experiences 
they've had and some of the pressures that they've felt about being single," 
Bobrow said. 
</P>
<P>
Bobrow also keeps composing songs from the show, which gives the producers the 
ability to pick and choose from a larger body of work. 
</P>
<P>
Bobrow is currently working on a show about putting on shows because he has 
found it to be, what he calls "an amusing and frustrating experience." His 
earlier shows included musical revues "Mixed Nuts" and "With Relish," which 
were produced in Los Angeles in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
If response to his work keeps up, Bobrow said it may even persuade him to give 
up his other career -- that of a lawyer specializing in estate planning.

BUSH TRANSPORTATION PLAN STARTS HEATED DEBATE; 
</P>
<P>
TAXES: THE EMPHASIS ON STATE AND LOCAL MONEY FOR ROADS AND TRANSIT MEETS 
IMMEDIATE CRITICISM. ITS BACKERS POINT TO ITS 'GREATER FLEXIBILITY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With its emphasis on state and local funding, the Bush Administration has begun 
what is certain to be a contentious debate over the appropriate federal role in 
maintaining the nation's transportation structures, congressional leaders and 
transportation industry officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"That debate will involve a reexamination of whose responsibility is 
transportation -- the state and local governments or the federal government," 
said Gary Brosch, director of the Center for Urban Transportation Research at 
the University of South Florida in Tampa. "The Administration, by this 
document, is saying that it's a local problem, and that states and local 
governments should find ways to solve it." 
</P>
<P>
The new transportation policy announced officially Thursday -- which contains 
169 guidelines and 65 legislative objectives, but offers no specific programs 
or funding proposals -- sends a signal of the Administration's intention to 
stick by its decision not to raise taxes. Although the policy describes the 
need for transportation upgrades, it rejects calls for federal taxes to pay for 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the policy argues that maintenance of some highways, bridges and 
airports should become more of a municipal and state responsibility. Moreover, 
the policy encourages local governments to raise taxes or to seek 
private-sector financing deals for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
The policy drew immediate criticism, foreshadowing the expected debates to come 
between the Republican Administration and the Democratic Congress. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most vocal critics was Rep. Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.), who told 
Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner at a House Public Works and 
Transportation Committee subcommittee hearing: "I think it's really vintage 
George Bush White House material -- a Twinkie transportation policy -- airy, 
light, but nothing but fluff at the core . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"At a time when our highways are crumbling, our bridges are collapsing, our 
airways are becoming overcrowded, dangerously, the Administration's solution is 
disengagement, wash your hands of the mess, call it a local problem." 
</P>
<P>
Other Democrats complained that the Administration has not been moving fast 
enough to spend uncommitted balances of billions of dollars in aviation, 
highway and mass transit trust funds. The trust funds are financed with the 
9-cent federal gasoline tax and other user fees. Both the Reagan and Bush 
Administrations have used trust fund balances to help offset on paper the size 
of the federal budget deficit. Trust fund money cannot be spent for purposes 
other than transportation. 
</P>
<P>
"This money has been paid by the American highway users in the expectation that 
it will be used for transportation purposes," said Rep. Glenn M. Anderson 
(D-San Pedro), chairman of the public works committee. "We are deceiving them 
by not spending the money for highways and transit despite the staggering needs 
which exist." 
</P>
<P>
In releasing the report, Skinner said: "The policy provides greater flexibility 
for state and local governments to raise revenues . . . for example, collecting 
tolls on highways, and encouraging greater private investment in 
transportation." 
</P>
<P>
He said the policy was released in time to be used by the Administration in 
debates over the reauthorization of aviation, highway and mass transit 
programs. Those programs will expire over the next 24 months. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not the panacea or the answer to all of the problems in transportation," 
Skinner said. "It was never designed to be that. It was designed to be a 
strategic framework under which we can make the many decisions that we are 
required to make and that we could use to reauthorize aviation and surface 
transportation." 
</P>
<P>
In part, the 129-page policy statement calls for legislation aimed at: 
</P>
<P>
Aviation -- Recovering a higher portion of program costs from user fees, and 
creating capacity at heavily traveled airports by imposing charges per 
passenger. 
</P>
<P>
Highway -- Increasing the state and local share of federal-aid projects, 
allowing greater use of tolls on federal-aid highways, focusing federal aid on 
highway programs and projects of "national significance." 
</P>
<P>
Urban Mass Transit -- Eliminating barriers to private sector participation in 
financing and operating projects, increasing state and local share of financing 
of federally assisted projects and reducing federal operating assistance for 
urban transit. 
</P>
<P>
Railroads -- Installing user fees to recover some of federal railroad safety 
inspection costs, repealing the Federal Employers' Liability Act to limit 
federal government exposure to costly worker suits and eliminating federal 
subsidies for Amtrak while requiring states to pay a greater share of the costs 
of routes through their areas. 
</P>
<P>
Skinner received some support from Republicans on the subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), who represents southern Orange County, told 
Skinner: "I was particularly heartened to see your interest in blending 
government's efforts with that of the private sector. In California . . . there 
is no question we're moving in the direction of the private sector assisting us 
(because) . . . we cannot furnish all the funds . . . publicly." 
</P>
<P>
Packard added, however, that he is disappointed by the "use of the trust funds 
to camouflage the deficit, when they are so badly needed for transportation 
purposes. I don't think any member of this committee is going to change their 
feeling on that." 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) said in a statement that the federal 
government should not abandon its prime role in transportation financing or 
shift the major burden onto the states. 
</P>
<P>
"The President says no new taxes, but what he apparently means is no new 
federal taxes, because he's proposing that the states raise their taxes very 
substantially," he said. "It's not clear the states can do so." 
</P>
<P>
At the hearing, Skinner cited California's reluctance to raise its gasoline 
tax: "I think we've got to do a better job of explaining to people all over the 
country, but especially to the people of California, (if) they want clean air, 
they want efficient transportation, they want to eliminate congestion, and they 
want backups in the case of earthquakes, they are going to have to pay more for 
fuel than the lowest prices . . . being paid almost anywhere in the country." 
</P>
<P>
As for the surplus trust fund balances, Skinner told the subcommittee the new 
transportation policy calls for spending more of the uncommitted money, but 
does so only in "generic" terms.

The state Senate passed and sent to the Assembly a bill endorsed by former 
President Ronald Reagan to make it a crime to use an unauthorized signature in 
campaign literature. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation by Sen. William A. Craven (R-Oceanside) was prompted by a 1986 
mailer authorized by Assemblyman John R. Lewis, a GOP strategist from Orange 
County, that contained Reagan's unapproved signature. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis was charged with felony forgery, but an appellate court threw out the 
charge on the grounds that the letters did not legally constitute forgery. 
Craven subsequently introduced the bill specifically making unauthorized use of 
a signature in campaign material punishable by a prison term, a $50,000 fine or 
both.

DRUG PARAPHERNALIA SEIZED IN FOUNTAIN VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Customs agents announced Thursday that they had seized an estimated $2 million 
in drug paraphernalia earlier this week, half from a glass factory in Fountain 
Valley and the rest from two locations in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests have been made so far, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The haul included pipes for crack cocaine and marijuana, water pipes known as 
"bongs," cocaine vials, and kits for cocaine and freebase, a concentrated form 
of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
The seizure, occurring simultaneously Tuesday in Southern and Northern 
California, was conducted under new federal laws making it a crime to sell drug 
paraphernalia across state lines. 
</P>
<P>
Agents said they believe the paraphernalia was manufactured in Fountain Valley, 
then shipped to a San Francisco warehouse for distribution nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said that agents with search warrants seized 6 1/2 tons of 
glassware and unfinished glass at Allied Glass Works, 17336 Mt. Wynne Circle, 
Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently there was some manufacturing of legitimate articles, such as vases 
and figurines," a spokesman said. But manufacturing drug paraphernalia seemed 
to be the main business, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Allied Glass Works has no telephone listing and no sign on its building, which 
is located in an area of small industries off Slater Avenue on the city's east 
side. The building was closed late Thursday with no indication that business 
was being conducted. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears they were maybe doing this on weekends," one customs investigator 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Urbanski, a Customs Service spokesman, said the investigation began three 
months ago and led, through information from retailers, to the three locations 
raided Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Northern California seizures took place at a storage facility in Concord 
and at N.E.A. Enterprises in Walnut Creek. Agents declined to identify the 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
"Although we view this as a significant victory, this is really only something 
of a small skirmish in the war on drugs," Urbanski said.

O.C. DRUG WAR: A LOSING BATTLE?; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: DESPITE RECENT SEIZURES OF TONS OF DRUG AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES CONCEDE THAT IT'S STILL CHEAP AND PLENTIFUL ON THE STREETS. 
</P>

Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates proudly says that recent drug seizures have 
removed "60 million doses" of cocaine from circulation and have relieved drug 
traffickers of several million dollars, but even he is reluctant to say just 
what impact such large-scale raids have on the cocaine trade. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had input from some of our people on the street that occasionally 
they've seen the price of cocaine go up in the last month or two," Gates said. 
"Obviously, we're having an impact. But we don't know how to quantify it at 
this point. I don't think we can say the price of cocaine is going up yet." 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Tim Simon, head of the county's Regional Narcotics Suppression Program, 
said the drug bust announced Thursday would have little effect on the street 
price of cocaine in Orange County because the drug network that was broken up 
after a six-month investigation was set up to distribute large quantities of 
cocaine across the United States, not small amounts within the county. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, narcotics officers from local police agencies say they have seen 
little or no change in the street price of cocaine since it fell from a steady 
$100 a gram a few years ago. And while the wholesale price of a kilogram (2.2 
pounds) of cocaine has gone up somewhat in the past year or so, it still costs 
only one-half to one-fourth of the price several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be that it cost $100 a gram on the street, no matter what the 
wholesale price was," said Costa Mesa Police Sgt. Tom Boylan. Now, a gram can 
cost as little as $20 or as much as $80, he said. "It depends on so many 
things, including how much it's cut down." 
</P>
<P>
Wholesale prices of cocaine have increased somewhat, ranging between $13,000 
and $18,000 a kilo -- or 5% to 20% more than last year -- but are still far 
less than the $45,000 a kilo commanded a few years ago or the $65,000 of the 
1970s. But the price increase is not enough to convince Boylan that the higher 
prices are the result of drug seizures. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to think the impact we're having has driven it up some, and that may 
be the case," Boylan said. "If we saw a tremendous increase, then you'd know. 
If we go back up to $30,000 a kilo, there would be no question about it." 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Police Lt. Vince Howard said that his narcotics officers are also 
seeing a small increase in the wholesale price of cocaine, but no real change 
in the street price of $50 to $60 a gram. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to think that we're making a big difference, but they seem to be 
replacing it as soon as we take it away," Howard said. "We're not going to 
really stop it, when they've got 20 tons stored in a warehouse, until all those 
people quit using it." 
</P>
<P>
J.D. Miles, head of the state Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement in Orange County, 
was more positive about the impact of the recent seizures. 
</P>
<P>
Miles estimated that the wholesale price of a kilo of cocaine has increased 
from $10,000 to $18,000 over the last year. Demand for the drug has leveled 
off, he said, while seizures have reduced the supply. 
</P>
<P>
"We are making some sort of dent here," Miles said. "Certainly, the seizures of 
dope and money are having a small effect."

STUDENTS SING IN A WORLDWIDE CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
He admits it's hard work sometimes, but Sean Goblirsch has found he enjoys 
singing -- particularly in a certain way. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to sing loud," said Sean, 11, a fifth grader at Del Obispo School in 
San Juan Capistrano, "because then everyone can hear you." 
</P>
<P>
Sean got a chance to sing as loud as he wanted on Thursday, as he and about 300 
other students from five Capistrano Unified School District schools, from 
elementary to high school level, lent their voices to what was billed as the 
sixth annual World's Largest Concert. 
</P>
<P>
The event is part of Music in Our School Month, an effort by the Music 
Educators National Conference to promote music education. 
</P>
<P>
The Capistrano students gathered at Triton Center on the San Clemente High 
School campus and, through a satellite hookup, joined to perform with an 
estimated 8 million students around the world. A big screen on the stage and 
television monitors around the room allowed the Orange County children to watch 
their counterparts in Florida, West Germany and Taiwan, to name a few places. 
Singer Marilyn McCoo, who was backed by McDonald's All-American High School 
Band, was the hostess of the event at Constitution Hall in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The students sang seven folk songs in five languages as PBS television cameras 
produced images on the monitors from Washington and other places. 
</P>
<P>
"There's something really neat about everyone singing together, the unity of 
all the different voices," said Kristen Harvey, 15, a sophomore at San Clemente 
High School and a member of the school choir. "It's easier to sing that way, 
because you get a lot of support." 
</P>
<P>
The concert started with "Many in One" by American composer Alice Parker. The 
students then sang a song in Latin, then a Liberian folk song whose lyrics 
translate as "Don't cry, pretty little girl, don't cry." 
</P>
<P>
After listening to the McDonald's band play Aaron Copland's "Fanfare for the 
Common Man," the students sang the Israeli folk tune "Tzena, Tzena" in English; 
"Sakura," a song about cherry blossoms, in English and Japanese, and "Las 
Mananitas," the Mexican birthday song, in Spanish and English. 
</P>
<P>
The final song, "A Round of Goodbyes" by American composer Frederick Silver, is 
the favorite of Cecily Scott, 15, a sophomore at San Clemente High School who 
was one of the most enthusiastic participants. 
</P>
<P>
"I just like the rhythm and the words," Cecily said. LEN HALL

COUNCIL APPROVES POLICE UNION PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ending several months of negotiations, the City Council approved a four-year 
contract with the city's police union this week. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 4 to 1 to approve the contract, with Councilman Thomas Lorch 
voting against the pact. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very excited that we finally reached an agreement," said Councilwoman 
Holly Veale. "I'm glad to have it behind us." 
</P>
<P>
Contract talks between city and police negotiators had stalled several times 
before both sides returned to the bargaining table last month. 
</P>
<P>
The San Clemente Peace Officers Assn. has been working without a contract since 
December. 
</P>
<P>
The new contract calls for an immediate 4.5% raise. Retroactive pay for the 
period between Jan. 1 and March 5 will be paid in a lump sum. Salaries will be 
raised an additional 3% on July 1 and by 2% on Jan. 1, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Also included in the contract is extra money for bilingual field officers and 
an extra week of vacation for officers with at least 15 years' experience.

PAIRS OF GUARDS START TO PATROL CITY PARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Starting this week, the city will keep a sharper eye on its parks. 
</P>
<P>
Under a new program, pairs of park guards will patrol the city's 13 parks by 
car and on foot. Afternoon and evening patrols will be emphasized. 
</P>
<P>
The council approved the program in December in response to complaints from 
people who said that some parks are becoming hangouts for transients. 
</P>
<P>
"Calls to the mayor's hot line have been increasing from people who pay the 
taxes on parks and are afraid to use them," Mayor Don E. Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
The officers are civilians, but all five who have been hired so far have been 
through police academy training and have been reserve police officers for the 
city. The park guards will wear badges, uniforms and batons but will not carry 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the five new guards and park maintenance supervisors Paul Lobato 
and Jim Smith piled into a white city van and toured the parks. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors pointed out the hot spots in each park -- where people gather 
and drink, where graffiti tends to appear and where the homeless find temporary 
shelter. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the use (of parks) and we encourage it," Jim Smith said. "We just 
don't want the abuse." 
</P>
<P>
The parks with the most problems are Eisenhower, El Camino and Hart Park, 
Police Capt. Dean Richards said. Hart Park, at 39 acres, is the largest. 
</P>
<P>
The guards, who have been patrolling the parks on a less frequent basis as 
reserve officers for about six months, have issued 200 to 300 citations for 
drinking in public and other offenses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
At Hart Park, where free meals attract several hundred homeless people each 
afternoon, loitering and drinking are big problems, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday morning, the park guards saw piles of bedding, clothes and trash in 
bushes at Hart Park and found one man huddled beneath a freeway overpass. 
</P>
<P>
By day, the officers will just walk by. But after 10 p.m., they will ask people 
to leave, because sleeping in city parks is illegal. The guards will pass out 
cards with the names and addresses of places needy people can go for shelter, 
clothing, food and other help. 
</P>
<P>
As public service officers, they can issue citations and make citizens' 
arrests, but regular police officers will be called if the guards need them, 
Richards said. The park guards will carry police radios and be in frequent 
contact with police dispatchers. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the public to be aware that they can come and talk to us anytime," 
said Tammy Hall, one of the new guards. "If there's a problem, they should tell 
us about it." SHANNON SANDS

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: REPORT EXPRESSES FEARS FOR TOLLWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 15-mile San Joaquin Hills tollway to run from Newport Beach to San Juan 
Capistrano and scheduled for construction next year, could run into trouble 
without state funds or if construction costs rise too rapidly, a consultant 
reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"The project is still financially viable -- though only marginally," Fieldman, 
Rolapp &amp; Associates of Irvine states in a report to the Orange County 
Transportation Corridor Agencies. "State funding, though minimal, is an 
integral part of the financing plan which, even with that support, is only 
marginally feasible." 
</P>
<P>
Banks poised to help finance the project have insisted that the state come up 
with $48.5 million previously committed in principle by the California 
Transportation Commission. But that money is now in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
The state is out of money for new highway construction, and a recent Los 
Angeles Times Poll found that 49% of voters surveyed statewide oppose a ballot 
measure that would increase the state gasoline tax and raise state spending 
limits to finance a major transportation improvement program. About 36% of the 
respondents favor the measure; 15% said they were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless Prop. 111 passes, we'll have to rethink everything we're doing around 
here," said William C. Woollett Jr., executive director of the corridor 
agencies, which plan to build three tollways in eastern and southern areas of 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
The agencies' staff, however, said the Fieldman, Rolapp report is somewhat 
misleading. The report, agency officials said, used on toll-revenue assumptions 
based on 2-year-old traffic studies while taking into account a recent update 
of cost estimates from $585 million to $601 million. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not really marginal," corridor agencies spokeswoman Donna Stubbs said. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Kreutzen, the agencies' financial chief, said that banks' refusal to 
issue letters of credit would not doom the project. Kreutzen said other 
financial arrangements such as bond anticipation notes can be made. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to work out alternatives," he said. "It's not a make-or-break 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
Former Orange County Supervisor Bruce Nestande, vice chairman of the California 
Transportation Commission, said he considers the Fieldman, Rolapp report an 
update rather than the final word. 
</P>
<P>
Nestande said it would be unfortunate if state funding now became the critical 
factor for the project. 
</P>
<P>
The San Joaquin Hills tollway will be an extension of the Corona del Mar 
Freeway, running from Newport Beach through Laguna Hills to the San Diego 
Freeway in San Juan Capistrano. JEFFREY A. PERLMAN

BEE CAREFUL: HIVES HALT DEMOLITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bulldozers leveling storage houses on an abandoned mushroom farm have been 
stalled this week by more than 120,000 bees producing their annual harvest of 
honey in three empty sheds. 
</P>
<P>
A week after the demolition work began at the 1920s-era farm on Golden West 
Street near Ellis Avenue, nine of 51 storage houses have yet to be bulldozed, a 
job that would ordinarily have taken just a few days. 
</P>
<P>
The bees are not just being removed but saved, said Dennis Patton, project 
specialist for Pomona Valley Equipment Demolition &amp; Site Clearance, the 
demolition company hired by the city. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city bought the farm to relocate an adjacent mobile home park 
and build part of a golf course, key provisions of a city redevelopment 
project. 
</P>
<P>
When Patton's crews discovered the bee problem, he said, he decided to call in 
an expert handler. "It costs us the same to take them out this way as it would 
to bring in an exterminator," Patton said. "And, that (extermination), of 
course, means killing them. And why would we want to do that?" 
</P>
<P>
Patton's firm hired David Dziedzic, a bee removal expert with Action Bee 
Control in Long Beach. When Dziedzic, 29, first saw the site, he said: "This 
looks like a bee farm, not a mushroom farm." 
</P>
<P>
Dziedzic estimated that each of the six remaining hives now contains 20,000 to 
75,000 bees, about one-third the number that would be nesting during the peak 
summer months. 
</P>
<P>
He devoted much of his first day on the job, Saturday, to removing a single 
hive, a network of honeycomb 8 1/2 feet high along the inside of one wall -- 
unusually tall, he said, because the bees were constricted into an 18-inch gap 
between studs. 
</P>
<P>
The painstaking process, which consumed five hours, began with Dziedzic -- in 
his protective suit, veil and gloves -- boring a hole into the wall. Then, 
using a small canister equipped with a hand pump, he injected smoke into the 
hole, scattering an initial swarm. 
</P>
<P>
"By using smoke on them, it simulates a forest fire," Dziedzic said. "During a 
forest fire, they naturally gorge themselves on honey, trying to gather as much 
food as they can before they leave. So they're preoccupied with that, and not 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Next, Dziedzic, using a crowbar, pried apart a pair of redwood planks 
surrounding the hole, exposing a wall of honeycomb. He then used a handsaw to 
remove a square wooden block, pumped in more smoke and, with his hands, began 
removing large pieces of hive. 
</P>
<P>
Within 90 minutes, he had sawed a large rectangular hole in the building wall, 
exposing the entire towering hive. As the comb was removed, Dziedzic loaded the 
bees into ventilated wooden boxes containing a series of frames, on which the 
bees will form a new hive and where they will be stored, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The process is always slow until he finds the queen bee, the key to the entire 
process, he said. Once the queen is found and placed in the box, the rest of 
the colony will soon follow. 
</P>
<P>
Dziedzic estimated that the hive contained 30,000 bees and probably 200 pounds 
of honey. The hive is slightly larger than average, but he has since discovered 
another in a separate building that is even more massive, with 75,000 bees.

BOND RATING HIKE WILL PAY OFF FOR CITY

<P>
City projects will cost taxpayers less in the future, thanks to an improved 
bond rating awarded to Anaheim on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Moody's Investor Service in New York, one of the nation's leading bond-rating 
services, upgraded the city's rating to the level of just a handful of 
California cities. 
</P>
<P>
Only Los Angeles and San Diego have better ratings than Anaheim, and Sacramento 
has an equal rating. 
</P>
<P>
The improved rating gives the Anaheim better credit, allowing the city to 
borrow at lower interest ratesThe lower rates could reduce annual interest on a 
$10-million bond by $100,000 to $200,000, said George Ferrone, Anaheim's 
finance director. 
</P>
<P>
"That's very good news from our standpoint," Ferrone said, "not only from the 
prestige standpoint, (but) also in the millions of dollars of interest 
savings." 
</P>
<P>
Projects to be funded by bonds include the proposed $95-million sports arena 
and street improvements connected to planned expansion of Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
"In looking down the road in terms of our future, it's certainly a good cushion 
to have," said Assistant City Manager James Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by Moody's followed a meeting in January where Ferrone asked the 
company to reconsider the city's current standing. LISA MASCARO

The Board of Education voted 5 to 2 to approve local cable television 
broadcasting of their meetings the first and third Wednesday nights of each 
month on channel 3. 
</P>
<P>
Dissenting board member Frank Davies said he was concerned that the estimated 
$15,000 a year going toward the broadcast would be spent on something few 
people would watch. 
</P>

Frank Conneli, assistant superintendent of business, said cable television

A man lost control of his pickup truck on Pacific Coast Highway and was injured 
Wednesday evening when the vehicle flipped over, pinning him inside for 30 
minutes, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Ken Cowell of the Newport Beach Police Department said the victim, who was 
later charged with drunk driving, was traveling west near the Santa Ana Bridge 
when the accident happened just after 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"The truck flipped over on its top and was flattened right down to the top of 
the door," Cowell said. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Beach Fire Department used the "jaws of life" hydraulic device to 
free the man from the truck, Cowell said. He was airlifted to Mission Community 
Hospital in Mission Viejo, where he was arrested and charged. The name of the 
man and his condition were not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
Police blocked off the westbound lanes of Pacific Coast Highway between Balboa 
Boulevard and Brookhurst Street for about two hours after the accident. 
Eastbound lanes were closed for about 45 minutes, Cowell said. TONY MARCANO

TEACHERS TRY SLOWDOWN IN HUNTINGTON BEACH DISPUTE

Teachers at a middle school in the Huntington Beach City School District are 
refusing to participate in extracurricular activities in hope of forcing 
district negotiators back to the bargaining table and settling a long and 
bitter contract dispute, union representatives said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The slowdown, begun earlier this week at Isaac L. Sowers Middle School, is a 
"grass-roots effort" started by teachers upset about the breakdown of formal 
negotiations, said Jim Harlan, executive director of the Huntington Beach 
Elementary Teachers Assn. Teachers at other schools have sent letters to 
parents explaining their dissatisfaction and may also participate in slowdowns, 
union officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been working without a contract since the first day of school in 
September," said Rebbie Bates, an 8th-grade teacher at Sowers and a union 
negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
Sowers teachers "represent 20% of this school district," Bates said, "and we 
decided that we're large enough that if we take a stand, the school board will 
notice." 
</P>
<P>
Similar slowdowns have begun at another Huntington Beach school district, Ocean 
View. Those teachers are also represented by the West Orange County United 
Teachers, which encompasses several teacher groups. Harlan said teachers in the 
Fountain Valley School District, also represented by the union, may take 
similar action. 
</P>
<P>
Activities that will be affected at Sowers are an African festival for 6th 
graders, a Renaissance fair for 7th graders and a career fair for 8th graders, 
plus the schoolwide science fair. The 8th-grade promotion ceremony, a senior 
trip to Disneyland and a trip to Knott's Berry Farm for exceptional students 
will go on as scheduled, but parents will accompany the students. 
</P>
<P>
Sports teams are continuing to participate in league play, but intramural games 
have ceased. 
</P>
<P>
District Supt. Diana Peters said parents have volunteered to supervise the 
festivals and fairs, but no decision has been made on whether to go on with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Contract talks in the Huntington Beach City District have broken down after 
nearly a year of negotiations and despite the intervention of a mediator. The 
dispute has reached the fact-finding stage, in which a three-person panel -- 
composed of representatives appointed by the union, the district and the state 
-- will meet to study each side's position. 
</P>
<P>
Harlan said the union hopes to work out a settlement before the fact-finding 
procedures, but Assistant Supt. Ron Brown, the district's chief negotiator, 
said face-to-face talks are over as far as the district is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's necessary that we go to fact finding," Brown said. "My question 
is, how long do they want to negotiate? They're asking for something we're not 
willing to give -- that's what mediation's for, and that didn't work." 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are stalled over salary terms and the length of the contract. The 
district has offered a two-year contract, while teachers demand a one-year 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
Bates said the teachers refuse to accept the two-year contract because the 
district is "not offering us a definite salary amount." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said the district's proposal calls for a 7% raise in the first year. In 
the second year it calls for the state-mandated cost-of-living allowance, or 
COLA, with 1% put aside to cover health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if the proposal were effective this year under the 3% COLA 
proposed in the state budget, the district would use 2% to raise salaries and 
1% to contribute to the health-care package. 
</P>
<P>
Bates said the union objects to the proposal because there is no way to 
determine the 1991 state COLA allocation. Also, teachers fear that it will be 
insufficient to cover rising health-care costs. 
</P>
<P>
But Brown said: "If the fringe benefit costs are too high, then the employees 
and the district need to sit down and talk about modifying the fringe program. 
We just can't maintain a Cadillac program." 
</P>
<P>
Harlan said the 220 union-represented teachers in the district will meet 
Wednesday. "As far as a strike being a possibility down the road," he said, "I 
would say anything is a possibility. We're looking at the possibility of 
working a whole year without a contract."

EX-POLICE CAPTAIN MAY RUN FOR SHERIFF; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: A CITY COUNCILMAN WITH 30 YEARS LAW ENFORCEMENT EXPERIENCE HAS UNTIL 
5 P.M. TODAY TO FILE IF HE DECIDES TO TAKE ON BRAD GATES.

<P>
A city councilman and former police captain with more than 30 years of law 
enforcement experience said Thursday that he is considering a bid to unseat 
Sheriff Brad Gates in the June 5 election. 
</P>
<P>
Don Bankhead, who was elected to the City Council in November, 1988, said he 
will announce today whether he is going to run after meeting with friends. The 
deadline for declaring candidacy for the June election is 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
If he runs, Bankhead, a Republican, would be the only challenger of Gates, who 
is seeking a fifth term. 
</P>
<P>
"I never try to do something unless I think there's a chance of succeeding," 
said Bankhead, 57. He declined to discuss possible issues in the race or why he 
is interested in running. 
</P>
<P>
After 31 years, Bankhead retired from the Fullerton Police Department in 1988 
with the rank of captain. His tenure there included several years as head of 
the department's investigations division. 
</P>
<P>
Bankhead, who has been discussing with campaign advisers a possible run for 
sheriff, appeared at a get-together last week at the Irvine Hilton that was 
attended by other political opponents of Gates. 
</P>
<P>
The gathering was hosted by former private investigator Mike Madigan, who 
co-wrote "The Twisted Badge" with Rancho Santiago College instructor George 
Wright, a longtime opponent of Gates and an unsuccessful candidate for sheriff 
in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Their book, sold at local bookstores, is critical of the Orange County district 
attorney's office and Gates, who has been repeatedly accused in lawsuits of 
using his department to investigate his critics, including Wright. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Novick, a former Orange County deputy district attorney who attended the 
gathering, said that Bankhead "is concerned about backing and money. The things 
that he doesn't have a problem with are the issues. He thinks there are issues 
that just won't quit." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently the only other person who has considered challenging Gates this year 
was Wright, but he decided against it this week when he did not meet the 
minimum requirements to run for office. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, a former U.S. Treasury agent and Santa Monica police officer, said 
Thursday he is precluded from running again by a state law requiring candidates 
for sheriff to be certified by the California Peace Officers Standards and 
Training, an organization that promulgates training policies for deputy 
sheriffs and police officers. 
</P>
<P>
The law, passed in 1988, was sponsored by state Sen. William Campbell 
(R-Hacienda Heights) at the behest of the California Sheriff's Assn., which was 
headed by Gates. Its members said they wanted to establish some basic 
qualifications for sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
Having not worked as a police officer for over five years, Wright has lost his 
POST certification and probably would have to take a 40-hour course to regain 
it, something that would be difficult as a full-time teacher, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wright said he wanted to challenge the constitutionality of the law because it 
excludes otherwise qualified candidates but changed his mind after two lawyers 
advised him that a lawsuit would be fruitless. 
</P>
<P>
"Trying to overcome that law would be monumental," Wright said. "It's possible 
but not probable, and the difficulty of doing that would drain resources. It's 
just not worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Wright, who teaches criminal justice, had alleged in a federal civil rights 
lawsuit in the mid-1980s that sheriff's deputies had put him and other 
political opponents of Gates under surveillance. Court records show that a 
recording of one of Wright's class lectures was later discovered in a deputy's 
garage. The lawsuit was settled by the county for $375,000 in 1987.

<P>
Since Sunday, the families of two mentally retarded El Toro men who boarded a 
bus bound for Mission Viejo and then disappeared have searched frantically for 
them, praying that they have come to no harm. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't go to sleep. I can't eat. It's just like they disappeared into thin 
air," said Penny Nichols, 42, the sister of Rory Nichols. He and Richard Neve 
set out early Sunday for an outing and never returned. "The scary thing is, I 
know Rory has probably had a number of seizures by now, and he's probably so 
disoriented he doesn't know where he is." 
</P>
<P>
Nichols, 35, suffers from epilepsy and did not take along his medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Since Sunday, family members have been distributing flyers with pictures of 
Nichols and Neve, 22. They have searched shopping malls and beaches where the 
two were fond of going. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they have no reason to suspect foul play but have not ruled 
out the possibility. 
</P>
<P>
"We're obviously growing more and more concerned because of the time period 
that's gone by," Orange County Sheriffs Lt. Bob Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed tips have placed the men at Laguna Hills Mall, Dana Point Harbor, 
South Coast Plaza, Fashion Island and at a florist shop in Mission Viejo, 
relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
When Nichols was handing out flyers at Laguna Hills Mall, a bus driver told her 
he had seen her brother Monday wandering around in a daze. 
</P>
<P>
"He said Rory had asked him (the bus driver) to take him to the Laguna Hills 
Mall," Nichols said. "The driver said he told him he was already at Laguna 
Hills Mall and when he left, Rory was walking around the bus station in 
circles." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, family members could only wait for news of the men, who had about 
$30 between them when they left home. 
</P>
<P>
Neve, who lived with his parents, had just returned from a trip to Las Vegas 
the week before he disappeared and had no more than $10 left, family members 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was supposed to show up for dinner at 5 p.m., and he never did," said his 
sister, Dawn Neve, 21. "He has a tendency to come home a couple of hours late 
sometimes, but he's never run away." 
</P>
<P>
Less than a mile away, Penny Nichols took a break from searching for her 
brother at shopping centers Thursday to wash his clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols shares a home with five other mentally retarded men under an 
independent living program for people who are borderline mentally disabled. 
Until recently, he had a job assembling window blinds and was scheduled to 
leave the group home soon to move into an apartment, his sister said. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols was planning Thursday to buy her brother a new dresser and a mattress 
pad after discovering three bottom sheets on his bed. 
</P>
<P>
She moved slowly through her brother's bedroom, pointing out his favorite 
posters and a picture of Rory with his ex-girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so sad. I just hope he's all right," Nichols said. "The scary thing is, I 
just can't imagine what could possibly be going on that would be more 
compelling than him calling home."

NEW CO-PASTOR IS HIRED FOR CRYSTAL CATHEDRAL

The Rev. Robert H. Schuller has hired a Presbyterian minister from Seattle to 
be co-pastor of the Crystal Cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
Schuller will remain as head of the ministry, but in June he will turn over the 
day-to-day operation to the Rev. Bruce Larson, pastor of Seattle's 3,600-member 
University Presbyterian Church. 
</P>
<P>
"I am strictly the No. 2 man (at the Crystal Cathedral)," Larson, 64, said in a 
telephone interview. "I am there to assist Bob to help build and bless that 
congregation." 
</P>
<P>
Schuller, 63, will spend most of his time to running his television ministry 
and will continue to conduct Sunday services for broadcast on his "Hour of 
Power" television show, church officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are two very separate tracks that meet at the Crystal Cathedral -- the 
world track with the 'Hour of Power' show, and the local track," Larson said. 
"The Orange County congregation will be my primary concern." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, several ministers have served in similar co-pastoral roles, 
Schuller assistant Chester Tolson said. Herman Ridder, who retired in 1988, was 
the last co-pastor of the 35-year-old congregation in Garden Grove. 
</P>

Church officials expressed the hope that Larson will be as popular in Orange 
County as he is in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
The University Presbyterian Church membership has doubled since Larson became 
pastor there in 1980. In addition, annual donations have increased to $5 
million from $600,000 in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Larson's pastoral duties will include coordinating and developing small groups, 
Tolson said, to allow the large congregation to feel more involved with the 
church and sermons. 
</P>
<P>
"The Crystal Cathedral is so large in numbers that if we create small groups, 
like Larson has done in Seattle, the congregation will feel more comfortable," 
Tolson said. 
</P>
<P>
Current membership at the Crystal Cathedral is estimated at 6,000, Tolson said.

BOYCOTT BECOMES AN OPTION FOR SOME BASEBALL FANS; 
</P>
<P>
LOCKOUT: FED UP WITH ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS, HUNTINGTON BEACH MAN SAYS THE TIME 
HAS COME TO SEND A MESSAGE TO TEAMS AND PLAYERS.

<P>
With baseball negotiations deadlocked and spring training camps closed now for 
22 consecutive days, Robert Johnson has run out of patience. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time for the fans' concerns and interests to be addressed," said Johnson, 
an unemployed accounting clerk from Huntington Beach. "We do not believe the 
fan should stand idly by and be forced to accept whatever result comes from the 
player-owner squabbles." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's solution: Boycott baseball. 
</P>
<P>
For every spring-training or regular-season game cancelled by the owners' 
lockout, fans should retaliate by refusing to attend two Angel games, Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson hopes to stir support for what he calls the "Orange County Fan Revolt, 
1990," a boycott of games designed to bring players and owners to their 
collective knees. His effort is one of several around the nation by groups 
purporting to represent fans. They all share a common goal: To pressure owners 
and players into resuming baseball. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of fans boycotting games may seem drastic. After all, games are what 
fans want to see. 
</P>
<P>
But similar sentiments are spreading from coast to coast as frustration builds 
over the stalled contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not going to advocate a boycott . . . at this point, but I will support 
any group out there doing it," said Rob Godfrey, a New Jersey delicatessen 
owner who organized a letter-writing campaign and one-day fan boycott in 1985 
trying to persuade players not to strike. 
</P>
<P>
"Realistically, I think a boycott without unity would have little effect this 
year," said Godfrey, founder of the National Baseball Fan Assn. (NBFA). "But 
when you look at the alternative, doing nothing, hey, we've got to do 
something." 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the NBFA, which says it has 1,000 members who pay $2 a year in 
dues, has begun urging baseball fans to write "Play Ball" on postcards and mail 
them to Post Office Box 4192, (the number of hits Pete Rose needed to break Ty 
Cobb's record) Mount Laurel, N.J. 08054. Godfrey said he'll dump the mail on 
baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent's porch. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has received only about 200 letters, Godfrey said, 50% of the 
writers are saying: "We've had enough, we tolerated you in '85, we tolerated 
you in '81. You've just lost us forever." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in New York, another organization, Strike Back, is claiming a much 
more successful letter-writing campaign protesting the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
"Groups like ours are one reason the strike ended so quickly" in 1985, said 
founder Eric Yaverbaum. 
</P>
<P>
Although fans have always flocked to ballparks after work stoppages, "we're 
reaching the fans' tolerance level," Yaverbaum said. "How often can you do this 
without fans doing something about it? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if 1990 is the year, but it's just a matter of time. This is the 
third (interruption of games) in 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
Yaverbaum says his group has received more than 10,000 letters. 
</P>
<P>
"The fans are an entity to be reckoned with," he said. "Once we get 50,000 
letters we'll take them and dump them at Fay Vincent's office." 
</P>
<P>
If the lockout or a subsequent players' strike results in a cancellation of 
regular-season games, Yaverbaum favors a boycott. 
</P>
<P>
"If these guys go out on strike when they come back . . . we want to boycott 
baseball an equal number of games," he said. "If we do it just this one time 
we'll never have to do it again. 
</P>
<P>
"Sooner or later . . . what we're pushing here will become reality. The fans 
will realize . . . the power is in their hands. Don't confuse what hasn't 
happened in the past with what can happen in the future." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, fans' organized efforts have had meager results. 
</P>
<P>
"We organized a walkout of Veterans Stadium," Godfrey said of the 1985 season. 
"It was after the seventh inning. We passed out literature in the stands and 
people got up and walked out." 
</P>
<P>
Such a protest might well go unnoticed in Southern California, the land where 
the seventh-inning stretch signals the dash to the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
What is the likelihood fans will stay away from the ballpark in protest? 
</P>
<P>
"I think the only way to answer that is that we hope we don't get to that 
point," said Los Angeles Dodger spokesman Mike Williams. "I don't know there is 
any way to tell until a situation like that occurred." 
</P>
<P>
"We hope they don't feel that is necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Angel spokesman Tim Mead said threatened fan boycotts are not new. 
</P>
<P>
"We heard that in '81," Mead said. "Fans are paying customers with the choice 
and with the option. You certainly wouldn't like to see it . . . " 
</P>
<P>
"The individual's entitled to his decision. As an industry, we hope that it 
doesn't get that far." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Larry Fick, a former vice president of the California Angels 
Boosters Club, said he might be willing to boycott "to send a signal. But one 
or two people is not going to make that big a difference." 
</P>
<P>
So far, fan unrest has had little effect despite the threat of class-action 
lawsuits by Florida cities unhappy about losing spring training revenue and 
another suit that was filed against baseball in Kansas City by a group called 
the Major League Baseball Fans Assn. complaining that "players are being 
deprived of conditioning." 
</P>
<P>
The likelihood of the lockout ending appears no greater on Day 23 than it did 
on Day 1. 
</P>
<P>
"I've reached an agreement with the union that there will be baseball in my 
administration," Vincent wisecracked recently. "We just haven't agreed on which 
year." 
</P>
<P>
So Robert Johnson wants the world to know he's not going to take it anymore. 
He's taking action. 
</P>
<P>
"We want them (the players) to lace up their cleats and play ball," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"So we're going to tie white shoe strings to our (car) antennas. It's symbolic 
of our protest. And of our budget."

NEWS OF ELDORADO'S PLAN TO BUY SURPRISES AMERICAN INTERSTATE 
</P>

<P>
Eldorado Bancorp, one of Orange County's largest and most profitable banks, 
Thursday announced a proposal to buy American Interstate Bank of Newport Beach 
in a stock transaction valued at $5.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
But American Interstate said in a statement late Thursday that it had received 
"no proposal upon which it could act," and Chairman Franklyn D. Jeans said he 
was "flabbergasted" by the Eldorado announcement. 
</P>
<P>
J. B. Crowell, president and chief executive of Eldorado, said the two 
institutions had been talking for several months and that he hopes to have a 
positive response from the American Interstate board of directors within 
several days. 
</P>
<P>
But Jeans said Crowell had simply given him an unsigned letter outlining the 
proposal when the two had lunch together in late February, and that the 
American Interstate board had decided that it was not interested in a merger at 
this time. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Crowell that we had discussed it but that we were concentrating on 
building our own institution, and I thought that was the end of it," Jeans 
said. "When I saw the press release, I damned near fell out of my chair." 
</P>
<P>
Crowell could not be reached for a response late Thursday, but Eldorado chief 
financial officer David Brown said: "I hope they're analyzing (the proposal) 
carefully. It doesn't sound like they spent much time with it." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said a "letter of intent" was sent to American Interstate on Thursday. He 
also said Eldorado had talked with some American Interstate shareholders who 
were interested in the deal and that Eldorado would "like to sit down and talk" 
with the American Interstate board. 
</P>
<P>
Jeans said he had received only another letter from Crowell along with the 
press release, not what he would consider a bona fide proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Gerry Findley, an Orange County banking consultant, said a deal "may make a lot 
of sense for both sides." He called Eldorado "an excellent bank" with an excess 
of capital and a need for faster growth and said that American Interstate 
offers some solid assets. 
</P>
<P>
Eldorado has over the past several years bought American Security Bank of San 
Bernardino, the Bank of Indio, and American Merchant Bank of Newport Beach. It 
now operates eight branches and has assets of $276.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
But Eldorado's 1988 effort to merge with Landmark Bancorp of La Habra -- a deal 
that would have created the largest banking company in Orange County -- did not 
come to fruition. A deal in which Citizen Holdings of Newport Beach would have 
purchased Eldorado also fell through in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
American Interstate, formerly known as American State Bank, experienced 
difficulties through much of the 1980s, after recovering from a brush with 
insolvency at the beginning of the decade. The bank operates two branches, one 
in Newport Beach and one in Orange; it has assets of $66.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Crowell said that although Eldorado also has branches in those two cities, each 
is on the other side of town. "They would fit very nicely into our network of 
branches," he said. "We feel we can take the assets (of American Interstate) 
and bring better bottom-line results. We've done that with our other three" 
acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
Eldorado's transaction proposal calls for Eldorado to issue 0.325 new shares of 
stock for each outstanding share of American Interstate. American Interstate 
would then be merged into Eldorado. 
</P>
<P>
Many small banking institutions are seeking to expand their bases to prepare 
for the increase in competition expected when interstate banking is allowed 
next year in the state. Jeans said there have been a lot of informal merger 
discussions taking place because of that.

'STREETCAR' DIRECTOR STRIVES TO EXPAND STANLEY'S ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
To Walter Brown's way of thinking, Stanley Kowalski has been reincarnated too 
often as white trash, the ghetto ape "who drools and drags his knuckles" across 
the American stage. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that Brown is disenchanted with the brutal linchpin of Tennessee 
Williams' classic drama "A Streetcar Named Desire." Like everybody else, Brown 
feels that Kowalski, in all his overheated vulgarity as Williams originally 
portrayed him, is one of theater's great characters. 
</P>
<P>
But Brown believes he's open to interpretation, with radical slantings. So the 
Stanley in the Eastern Boys Productions contemporary staging of "Streetcar," 
directed by Brown and opening today in Santa Ana, is less "a steamy, sensual 
person" than a "boisterous man, something like a boy who hasn't grown up." 
</P>
<P>
He's also black. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who is white, cast R.A. Blankenship Jr., the actor who runs Eastern Boys 
Productions, as Stanley. He also picked another black actor, Mellow Martin, as 
Mitch, Stanley's best friend and the suitor of Blanche, the soiled Southern 
lady whom Stanley ruins. 
</P>
<P>
A white actress, Deirdre West, plays Blanche. Intriguing, yes -- but would 
Williams approve or would he think it too subversive? Highly arguable, but 
Brown said he has no reservations. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he wouldn't be upset because I'm not into distorting his vision, but 
trying to enhance it and make it more (accessible) for a general audience," 
Brown said. "This isn't like putting 'The Mikado' on the moon. This tries to be 
true to the theme of 'Streetcar.' " 
</P>
<P>
Brown cited several reasons for the casting. Primarily, he thinks that too many 
stage standards play mainly for white audiences, usually "disenfranchising" 
black theatergoers from the experience at hand. There are several works that, 
through some creative tinkering, can reach a wider range of people, and Brown 
obviously feels "Streetcar" is one. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we can break the idea that Tennessee Williams is only for white 
audiences and white actors. As a director, I hate being cut out of a large 
talent pool (of black performers) and (restricted) to an audience that is 
primarily white." 
</P>
<P>
He also contends that modern audiences, more liberal-minded than those when 
"Streetcar" was first staged in 1947 with Marlon Brando as Stanley, may find 
the social status-based tensions between Blanche and Stanley quaint and 
unconvincing. 
</P>
<P>
But the notion of the interracial marriage of Stanley and Stella, Blanche's 
younger sister, and the subsequent sexual tension between Stanley and Blanche 
is bound to generate drama, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
"We talk about it originally having impact because of the social mismatch," he 
explained. "But now in Southern California, I doubt that would impress most 
people. But you put a black man and a white woman together -- that has impact." 
Also, Brown believes that because there are more interracial relationships 
these days, "most people would see the casting as believable." 
</P>
<P>
At first, Brown leaned toward finding an Asian-American actor, possibly 
Vietnamese, to play Stanley, mainly to reflect the ethnic makeup in Orange 
County. But he decided on Blankenship because "he really knew what to do with 
the role." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Blankenship said he feels comfortable with the role and prepared 
for it in only the usual ways. "I don't look at this as a black-white issue," 
he said flatly. "I think he can be played by anyone who understands the 
character." 
</P>
<P>
Brown did concede that the choice of Martin as Mitch is "more of a gamble, an 
experiment really." He said it will probably be difficult for some to accept 
the idea of the affected and proper Blanche seeing a black man as her romantic 
savior. 
</P>
<P>
The director was so unsure that he didn't settle on Martin until this week. He 
considered using a Latino actor as a compromise that would maintain the racial 
element but be more acceptable in keeping with Blanche's character. 
</P>
<P>
"We may be stretching it with Mitch; it's really up in the air, and we won't 
know if it works until later on," Brown said. "But I don't think we're gambling 
with Stanley, not at all." 
</P>
<P>
 The Eastern Boys Productions of "A Streetcar Named Desire" opens tonight and 
plays Fridays and Saturdays at 7:30 p.m. through March 31 at the Santa Ana City 
Hall Police Annex Auditorium, 23 Civic Center Plaza, Santa Ana. Tickets: $15, 
with $5 of each ticket to be donated to the homeless. Information: (714) 
998-2199.

HEAVY METAL METAMORPHOSIS WAS A LAUGHING MATTER 
</P>

<P>
Besides all the usual problems of promoting successful rock shows, Club Tangent 
has a cultural hurdle to overcome: How do you bring alternative rock -- and 
alternative rock fans -- into a den of heavy metal? 
</P>
<P>
The Great Divide between the worlds of heavy metal and alternative rock was 
apparent in the quips and musical jokes coming from the stage at the Marquee on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Jacobs, singer for the headlining Swamp Zombies, joshingly commanded the 
audience to flash the traditional heavy metal hand sign. "C'mon, this is the 
Marquee -- give us the devil horns!" 
</P>
<P>
And opening act Don't Mean Maybe finished its set with "Citadel," a howling, 
falsetto-voiced spoof of heavy metal's tendency to turn itself into opera 
buffa. 
</P>
<P>
Those two bands and a third county group, the Clints, relaunched Club Tangent 
in its new quarters before a sparse audience that according to promoters Kitty 
Bash and Octavious totaled 50 paying customers and 20 guests. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought there would be a lot more people, at least 100 paid," Octavious 
said, attributing the sparse crowd to Tangent's move to a new location and 
stiff competition from Bogart's, where Mary's Danish, a strong alternative-rock 
attraction, played a near-sellout show Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Club Tangent began as an every-Wednesday alternative-rock showcase in August. 
Its previous host club, Manhattan's in Stanton, closed in January because of a 
business dispute among owners, prompting Bash and Octavious to seek a new 
location. 
</P>
<P>
The Marquee offers obvious advantages: It can hold 452 people; Manhattan's 
holds 300. But with a layout that includes separate stage and bar areas, the 
smaller shows Club Tangent books should maintain a sense of intimacy. The 
Marquee also offers a large stage and good concert lighting. 
</P>
<P>
On the down side, Club Tangent will no longer draw the younger crowd it could 
pull into Manhattan's, which admitted concert-goers 18 and over. To get into 
the Marquee, you must be 21. 
</P>
<P>
And there is the heavy metal barrier. Fans and musicians in alternative-rock 
circles tend to look at the metal scene the way academics tend to look at 
sitcoms -- as a formulaic, mercenary genre driven by the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge, Octavious acknowledged before the show, is to make 
alternative-rock fans expand their itinerary to a new spot off their usual 
circuit -- at least for one night a week. The promoters' goal is modest enough 
-- a draw of 100 or more fans each Wednesday (Octavious said Tangent's draw at 
Manhattan's had built gradually to an average of 130 to 180). 
</P>
<P>
To reach that goal in a hurry, Bash and Octavious are taking a risk in coming 
weeks by booking more expensive nationally known bands, instead of Tangent's 
usual diet of local rock contenders. Caterwaul, a critically hailed I.R.S. 
Records act, headlines Wednesday, with locals the Pivot Foots and Naked Soul 
opening. Firehose, a college radio favorite, plays the Marquee on March 21, 
with Twisto Frumpkin and Flatbed opening. Ticket prices will be $10 for those 
shows; the Swamp Zombies bill cost $5. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to have two big shows so we could establish alternative rock on 
Wednesday nights a lot quicker," Octavious said. "If we did smaller bands, it 
would take a lot longer. This way it should go faster for us." 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Tabak, co-owner of the Marquee, said he will be happy if Club Tangent 
can average 100 or more fans a week. He is willing to give Bash and Octavious 
two months to build an audience for alternative rock. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday "has been my slowest night of the week," with a typical draw of 30 to 
40 people, Tabak said. "I've had classic (rock) cover bands, other promoters, 
DJs, wet T-shirts, every possible thing I could think of. I haven't been able 
to get anything to fly." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Wednesday's bill offered moments that the Marquee's usual metal crowd 
might have enjoyed. The Swamp Zombies, playing with their accustomed energy, 
irreverence and infectious sense of enjoyment, ended their set with one of 
their typically skewed acoustic takes on the rock classics, including Black 
Sabbath's "Iron Man," complete with howling feedback from Jacobs' upright bass. 
</P>
<P>
That metal transposition finished a concluding medley that also included 
snippets from Metallica, the Circle Jerks, the Pixies and the Brady Bunch -- an 
omnivorous sequence that was indicative of the Swamp Zombies' humorous, 
try-anything philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
The set, vastly overamplified by the Marquee's sound crew, showed that the 
Swamp Zombies have evolved from a rough, good-time band into a strong musical 
unit that can rock impressively with amplified acoustic instruments and rough 
but rich harmonies. "Creeps," a catchy novelty song, was the highlight among 
several new numbers that will be on "Scratch and Sniff Car Crash," the new 
Swamp Zombies album due out next month. 
</P>
<P>
The show did not include the band's version of Public Enemy's rap hit, "Fight 
the Power," which Jacobs said will appear on the album. 
</P>
<P>
Don't Mean Maybe's well-played set included a surprising wrinkle: a swinging 
boogie version of Led Zeppelin's "Houses of the Holy." Although Mark Andrea's 
laconic singing on that oldie lacked bite, the song came as an interesting 
change of pace from Don't Mean Maybe's usual lean, angular, hard-edged take on 
guitar psychedelia. 
</P>
<P>
Andrea was not as rambunctious as he can be on his best nights, but he, drummer 
Jeff Fairbanks and bassist John Hawthorne gave a tight, well-honed performance 
that centered on Don't Mean Maybe's new album, "Live Sample," due out next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
The Clints' set was spirited, but not nearly sharp enough to make their driving 
guitar rock soar. Harmonies involving all four members (each one named Clint 
and decked out in a black cowboy hat, in keeping with the band's dubious 
joke-Western persona) clicked at times, but more often they sputtered and 
squawked. 
</P>
<P>
Clint Ambuter and Clint Wade, the guitarists who sang most of the leads, lacked 
the vocal range to do justice to the band's strong melodies (Ambuter had a 
particularly rough night). 
</P>
<P>
As their album, "No Place Like Home," demonstrates, the Clints have plenty of 
worthwhile ideas and a good notion of how to construct a sharp pop-rock song. 
Several new songs showed an emerging Bob Dylan influence to go with their New 
Wave leanings. 
</P>
<P>
But for all of it to work, the Clints need to graduate from creaky garagedom to 
a strong, confident level of musicianship. As far as live performance goes, 
these Clints are going to need a lot of target practice before they can think 
of making anybody's day.

The following are summaries of recent Times restaurant reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Emperor's Fortune, 3820 Plaza Drive, Santa Ana. (714) 850-9008. Open Mondays 
through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., Saturdays till 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Emperor's Fortune is the latest incarnation in haute Chinese, a Hong 
Kong-elegant dining room designed with obvious expense. Everything is 
well-crafted, even if the taste spectrum tends to be on the bland side, and 
there is considerable imagination in the presentations. Peking duck, with an 
amazingly crispy skin, is the big hitter, and you'll want to try such dishes as 
Shrimp Go Nuts, mussels in garlic sauce and any of the wonderful desserts (from 
Grand Finale). Expect to have your wallet lightened considerably. 
</P>
<P>
Showley-Wrightson, 2531 Eastbluff Drive, Newport Beach. (714) 760-9700. Open 
Mondays through Fridays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., Tuesdays through Saturdays from 
6 to 9:30. 
</P>
<P>
 Showley-Wrightson is an unlikely little gem of a restaurant, hidden away in a 
tony Newport Beach shopping center (the owners have tried to infuse the place 
with atmosphere but it still looks like an upscale grocery store with tables). 
Wonderful breads like fougasse and a dense walnut loaf begin the proceedings, 
and there is a wide array of entrees and desserts to choose from, all made on 
the premises. Don't miss risottos, grilled smoked beef, or the flourless 
chocolate cake. They pack picnic baskets too. 
</P>
<P>
Cafe Zinc, 350 Ocean Ave., Laguna Beach. (714) 494-6302. Open Tuesdays through 
Saturdays from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., Sundays 7 to 4. 
</P>
<P>
Belisle's, 12001 Harbor Blvd., Garden Grove. (714) 750-6560. Open 24 hours a 
day, 7 days a week. 
</P>
<P>
The dilemma of where to take an out-of-town guest can be solved at Cafe Zinc, a 
Berkeley-style cafe in Laguna, or Belisle's, a truck stop-style restaurant in 
Garden Grove. I'll let you figure out the rest of the equation. Cafe Zinc has 
remarkable, densely foamed cappuccino, fresh, imaginative muffins like millet 
or cranberry and an outdoor patio. Belisle's trades on giant platters, 
eye-popping pastries and true grit Americana like grits, mush and corn bread. 
Good morning, y'all. 
</P>
<P>
Dynasty, 9200 Bolsa Ave., 215, Westminster. (714) 898-3189. Open Mondays 
through Fridays from 10 a.m. to 9:30 p.m., weekends from 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 A vast Hong Kong style restaurant in a Little Saigon shopping mall, Dynasty is 
beginning to strut its stuff. The dining room is now in the hands of the 
capable Tony Lai, a Chinese foodie with Beverly Hills in his resume, and both 
food and service have taken a sharp upturn. Black pepper beef brisket from the 
page one specials menu is extraordinary, and don't miss the first-rate kung pao 
dishes, sand dabs with spicy salt, or soy sauce squab. On a menu with 150 
entrees, there is much to choose from. 
</P>
<P>
La Palma Chicken Pie Shop and Restaurant, 928 N. Euclid Ave., Anaheim. (714) 
533-2021. Open Mondays through Saturdays from 10:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. Bakery 
opens at 9. 
</P>
<P>
 This is where you want to go for meat loaf, pan fried chicken and the other 
kinds of tried and true, roadside American fare that are creeping back onto the 
menus in more upscale establishments. The signature dish, chicken pie, is a 
buttery, 9 oz. disc crammed with shredded meat. At $1.95 it makes a great, 
affordable snack. Don't bypass the attached bakery, where the goodies include 
peach pie, burnt almond cake and a rich house cheesecake, and an excellent, 
springy chocolate cake is only three dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Greek Cuisine, 13011 Newport Ave., Tustin. (714) 731-1179. Open Mondays through 
Fridays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.; Sundays through Thursdays from 5 to 10, Fridays 
and Saturdays till 11. 
</P>
<P>
Flamingo, 17185 Brookhurst, Fountain Valley. Open Tuesdays through Thursdays 11 
a.m. to 9 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till 11. 
</P>
<P>
Ethnic eateries in mini-malls, Greek Cuisine in Tustin boasts exquisite taramo, 
creamed carp roe, fall-off-the-bone oregano chicken and a fine array of Greek 
specialties, while Flamingo in Fountain Valley is more terra incognita: seco 
norteno (piquant lamb stew in onion gravy), papas a la Huancaina (potatoes in a 
cheese sauce blanket), picarone (hot pumpkin fritters in blackstrap molasses). 
Both restaurants are casual and inexpensive. 
</P>
<P>
Viva Italia, 303 Broadway, Laguna Beach. (714) 497-6220. Open daily from 11:30 
a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and 5:30 to 10:30. 
</P>
<P>
The VIVA in Viva Italia is an acronym for the first initials of brothers 
Vittorio, Ignacio, Vincenzo and Antonio Romeo, and the restaurant seems to have 
caught on as neatly. It's a somewhat cramped version of an Italian trattoria: 
terra cotta floor, tile kitchen, elbow-to-elbow seating. Food is simple and 
straightforward but erratic. Pastas and wood fired pizzas are the best bets. 
Beach crowd salads and ill-conceived main courses can be passed over. Service 
is snappy and efficient. 
</P>
<P>
Bayou St. John, 320 Main St., Seal Beach. (213) 431-2298. Open daily from 5 to 
10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Bayou St. John in quiet Seal Beach is currently Orange County's only bona fide 
Cajun restaurant: The boom has faded, but not the delights of this cuisine. 
Indulge yourself with such specialties as homemade gumbo, full of hidden 
flavors; oysters Rousseau, a rich appetizer with cheese, bacon, cream sauce and 
spicy tomato; and stuffed trout, pan fried in pure butter. Blackened items are 
a must. Seafoods are flown in from the Gulf. Dixieland music on tape furnishes 
the nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
Hyang Chon, 12921 Fern St., Stanton. (714) 891-5166. Open daily from 10 a.m. to 
11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Eel, grilled short ribs and barbecued herring are just a few items on this 
Korean restaurant's exotic and varied menu. Pan cha, colorful side dishes, are 
especially good here, with such specialties as gae jang, raw marinated crab, 
and jap chae, glass noodle with meat and vegetable. Lunchtime prices are a 
steal. 
</P>
<P>
Revere House, 900 W. 1st St., Tustin. (714) 543-9314. Open Mondays through 
Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m., Sundays from 10:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Revere House is one of those dark, woody dinner houses that were popular 
during the '50s, and guess what: That's when the place opened. It specializes 
in credible versions of plain old American food-prime rib, pan fried chicken, 
turkey with all the trimmings-all churned out with dependable regularity. The 
menu is enormous and portions are Protean. All entrees come with a choice of 
Caesar or spinach salad. Desserts are the one weak spot, except for the tapioca 
pudding you get for free. 
</P>
<P>
The Hobbit, 2932 E. Chapman Ave., Orange. (714) 997-1972. Open for dinner 
Tuesdays through Sundays at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Hobbit is a special occasion restaurant, serving prix fixe dinners that are 
elaborate without being pretentious. Book well in advance. You begin the 
evening in the restaurant's wine cellar, nibbling on Julia Child-like 
appetizers, sipping champagne and chatting with total strangers. Chef Mike 
Phillippi takes it all very seriously, preparing solid food that is 
well-balanced, though rarely brilliant. Entrees like beef Wellington and 
lobster Thermidor rotate weekly. Service is performed by smiling waitresses in 
print uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
Gandhi, 3820-D Plaza Drive, South Coast Plaza Village, Santa Ana. (714) 
556-7273. Open daily from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and 6 to 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Gandhi could be called new wave Indian: it roasts quail in its clay oven and 
pours Beaujolais nouveau as often as beer. Phlegmatic waiters in fancy tuxedoes 
perform service on the brass enclosed patio, a former pizzeria that looks more 
like Paris than Delhi. Appetizers like chicken tikka salad and the various 
tandoori dishes are refined and pleasant. Spicy dishes like lamb in spinach 
puree and curried eggplant are even better. Expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Grappa, 2304 W. Ocean Front, Newport Beach. (714) 675-1930. Open Tuesdays 
through Thursdays from 6 to 10 p.m., Fridays through Sundays till 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Grappa, housed in what used to be Zeppa, is yet another beachfront Italian 
restaurant in Newport. New owner Vincenzo Gentile hasn't changed the basic 
concept: The restaurant still resembles a Florentine villa, with a kitchen that 
churns out such favorites as great fried calamari, salads with lots of balsamic 
vinegar, and upscale pastas such as agnolotti and penne. Nodino alla griglia, 
an excellent veal chop grilled with aromatic herbs, is a standout. Desserts are 
intelligently underindulgent. 
</P>
<P>
Places Afar, 25932 Muirlands Blvd., Mission Viejo. (714) 581-4200. Open daily 
except Tuesdays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 5 to 10. 
</P>
<P>
Calesa, 2106 Tustin Ave., Santa Ana. (714) 541-6585. Open daily except Sundays 
from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 5 to 10. 
</P>
<P>
Places Afar is your basic Cuban-French-Vietnamese restaurant; the English is 
circumspect, the cooking is spectacular. Start with Cuban ham croquettes 
alongside greaseless plantain chips, or a bowlful of smoky black bean soup. 
Then try Imperial salad from Vietnam. Evenings, there are such French classics 
as couscous and choucroute. Calesa has a sign boasting "Round-the-World-Dining" 
-- it's a luxurious restaurant with Filipino, Asian and Continental 
specialties. There is a wide selection of main dishes from paella to sate, and 
cooking is often on the sweet side. Service is formal, and waiters in tuxedos 
flame desserts with enthusiasm that borders on lust. 
</P>
<P>
Faraday's Grill and Spirits, 13102 Newport Ave., Tustin (714) 730-3442. Open 
Sundays through Thursdays from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till 11 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Faraday's is a family restaurant with cheerful service, juicy burgers and some 
mighty devoted fans. Why else would anyone wait half an hour for institutional 
food on a Tuesday evening? Everybody goes ape over onion strings, mountains of 
flour dredged onions deep fried until crispy, and the sappy sweet barbecue that 
kids favor so shamelessly. Breakfast is actually quite credible here, with 
fluffy pancakes, homemade muffins, and squeezed-to-order OJ. Portions are 
predictably generous and prices are modest. 
</P>
<P>
Baci, 18748 Beach Blvd., Huntington Beach. (714) 965-1194. Open Wednesdays 
through Sundays from 5:30 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Baci is just a storefront restaurant with modest decor, but young New Yorker 
Angelo Parisi gives his food a rough sophistication; nearly all his dishes are 
touched with originality. All of Italy finds its way onto Parisi's small menu. 
Complimentary appetizers might be a superbly light chicken minestrone or some 
cold garlic-infused broccoli. Dishes such as fettuccine agnello, flat noodles 
with stewed lamb, and linguine tuttomare, with scungilli and shrimp, sustain 
the enthusiasm. The best dessert is panna cotta, the poor man's creme brulee. 
</P>
<P>
Hastings, in the Anaheim Hilton and Towers, 777 Convention Way, Anaheim. (714) 
750-4321. Open Fridays through Tuesdays from 6 to 11 p.m. Call for lunch times. 
</P>
<P>
Hastings has good food for a hotel restaurant but other aspects of dining there 
can be annoying; service is particularly spotty and indifferent. The room is 
predictably clubby with the predictable hotel creature comforts. The menu 
features a sumptuous lobster ravioli appetizer, a fine seafood Caesar salad, 
and some highly credible entrees, among them filet mignon that melts in the 
mouth and a great veal. Seafoods are done handsomely. The wine list is 
extensive and intelligent. 
</P>
<P>
Hassan's Cafe, 3325 Newport Blvd., Newport Beach. (714) 675-4668. Open Tuesdays 
through Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 5:30 to 11, Sundays from 5:30 to 
11 only. 
</P>
<P>
 Hassan's Cafe specializes in the cuisine of Lebanon -- a hybrid of Turkish, 
French, and local influences -- and the restaurant is relaxing and exotic. 
Mazza, one of the world's great noshes, is the absolute must here, a splendid 
array of Middle Eastern appetizers such as mutebel, a smoky eggplant dip, and 
warrab ennaq, vine leaves stuffed with aromatic rice. There are interesting 
main dishes such as kibbe nayya, raw ground lamb mixed with bulgur wheat, sort 
of an Arabic version of steak tartare. Kebabs are first-rate. 
</P>
<P>
Nui Ngu, 10528 McFadden Ave., Garden Grove. (714) 775-1108. Open Tuesdays 
through Thursdays and Sundays from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till 
8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Pagolac, 14564 Brookhurst St., Westminster. (714) 531-4740. Open Tuesdays 
through Sundays from noon to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Little Saigon is always an arresting place to browse when in the mood for 
adventurous inexpensive dining. Nui Ngu, in a misbegotten strip mall on 
McFadden Avenue, specializes in the wonderfully obscure cuisine of Hue, in 
Central Vietnam. Bun bo Hue, a peppery beef noodle soup, and banh bot loc, 
sticky tapioca flour dumplings, are unforgettable. At Pagolac you can 
experience a phenomenon known as bo bay mon, literally "seven courses of beef." 
The Vietnamese are mad for it. Unload a truck before you go. 
</P>
<P>
Bagatta, 3012 Newport Blvd., Newport Beach. (714) 675-4020. Open Mondays 
through Thursdays from 6 to 11 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till midnight. 
Sundays from 5 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The early returns show Bagatta to have a healthy lead in the Newport Beach 
Italian restaurant sweepstakes. It's a terrific addition to the local dining 
scene. Chef Andrea Rogantini brings heavyweight experience to the kitchen. 
Owner Tony Bagatta makes a charming host. Such dishes as salmon carpaccio, 
latticed with a moss green pesto sauce, and dry cured bresaola make spectacular 
beginnings. Pastas are beautifully textured. Desserts such as zucotto and 
homemade spumoni are other-worldly. 
</P>
<P>
Sapori, 1080 Bayside Drive, Newport Beach. (714) 644-4220. Open daily from 
11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., till 11 p.m. weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Sapori is a modish, elegant neighborhood trattoria where the cooking is 
serious. Chefs Adriano and Franco Maniacci hail from Palermo, Sicily, but play 
no favorites with regard to the many regions of Italan cuisine. Bruschetta di 
pane Saracena, triangles of roasted wheat bread with a garlic puree, are 
delightful, and many pastas come blanketed in savory sauces. Suprema di rombo, 
turbot in a leek and watercress sauce, pays homage to nouvelle. Veal Milanese 
is the best you'll find anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Kitayama, 101 Bayview Place, Newport Beach. (714) 725-0777. Open Mondays 
through Fridays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., daily from 6 p.m. to 10:30. 
</P>
<P>
Kitayama, the first really serious Japanese restaurant in Orange County, is an 
exquisite addition to the local dining scene. You'll think you've wandered into 
a Buddhist temple -- until you taste the delicate, sophisticated cooking of 
Yoshio Shirai and his team of chefs. The sho-ka-do lunch is the most beautiful 
$14 meal anywhere, and the omakase kaiseki, a multicourse feast at $50 per 
person, is unforgettable.

DEFIANT, HOSTILE NORTH TESTIFIES POINDEXTER DIRECTED CONTRA EFFORT

<P>
Oliver L. North, a reluctant and testy leadoff witness at John M. Poindexter's 
trial, testified today that he was operating at the direction of Poindexter and 
other Reagan Administration superiors when he guided a covert operation arming 
the Nicaraguan Contras. 
</P>
<P>
North testified that he was told "in so many words" he was responsible for the 
Contras and kept Poindexter, then-President Ronald Reagan's national security 
adviser, fully informed of his work to help the anti-Sandinista rebels after 
Congress ordered U.S. military aid shut off. 
</P>
<P>
Compelled to testify by Iran-Contra prosecutors, North was labeled a "hostile 
witness" by the judge in Poindexter's trial and admitted nothing without a 
struggle during his day on the stand. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by prosecutor Dan Webb, he reluctantly admitted that he 
supervised the arms-supply operation put together by retired Air Force Maj. 
Gen. Richard V. Secord. 
</P>
<P>
"At no time, as you were running your operation, you never tried to conceal or 
hide what you were doing from either Admiral Poindexter or Robert McFarlane?" 
Webb asked, the second reference being to Poindexter's predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not," North said. 
</P>
<P>
"Were you ever trying to direct that operation on your own, independent of your 
superiors?" Webb asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Never," North replied. 
</P>
<P>
"Didn't you keep them apprised of all of your Contra-related activities?" Webb 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," North said. 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter, a retired Navy rear admiral who succeeded McFarlane in late 1985, 
is charged with conspiracy, two counts of obstructing Congress and two counts 
of making false statements. The charges concern accusations that he tried to 
cover up North's military assistance and fund-raising for the Contras as well 
as White House knowledge of a 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
North testified that Poindexter, while he was McFarlane's deputy, was among 
those who told him to work to provide assistance to the Nicaraguan Contras as 
Congress was shutting off direct U.S. military aid. 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter "told you you were becoming the person who would replace the CIA" as 
the source of military support for the Contras? he was asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to put those words in his mouth," North said, but "in that 
general time frame he was one of the persons." 
</P>
<P>
"You were told, were you not, that you were supposed to go fund and arm the 
Contras?" Webb asked. 
</P>
<P>
"In so many words, yes," North said. But he disputed Webb's suggestion that he 
set up an "enterprise" with Secord and others to buy and ship arms to the 
Contras. 
</P>
<P>
"It began as something small, it evolved over time," North said. 
</P>
<P>
Webb asked North if he could recall the late CIA Director William J. Casey 
telling him "the ball is in your hands" after Congress shut off funds for the 
rebels. 
</P>
<P>
"In words to that effect," North replied.

Two men who stuffed a woman into a North Hollywood trash dumpster during a 
kidnaping and apparent robbery attempt ran off when an Internal Revenue Service 
agent heard her screams and shot at them, Los Angeles police said today. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, a 44-year-old Van Nuys resident whose name was not released, was 
bruised and frightened but otherwise uninjured after the 8:15 p.m. incident 
Thursday, Police Lt. Ron La Rue said. 
</P>
<P>
The two suspects escaped. 
</P>
<P>
John Everett, an agent with the IRS criminal investigation division in Los 
Angeles, was conducting surveillance work in the vicinity of Hesby Drive and 
Lankershim Boulevard when he heard screams coming from the parking lot of the 
Security Pacific bank at the corner. Everett ran to the parking lot and saw 
that two men had put a woman into a trash dumpster and were closing the lid on 
her, La Rue said. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS agent identified himself and fired his handgun at the two men. They 
jumped into a nearby car and fled.

The grandson of one of the founders of the Mayo Clinic has been fined $4,000 by 
the Minnesota Board of Medical Examiners for not diagnosing illnesses in his 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
During his 16 years with Group Health in the Twin Cities, Dr. Charles H. Mayo 
II failed to diagnosis lung cancer in one patient, leukemia in another, skin 
cancer in a third, and a broken forearm in a fourth, according to a document 
signed by Mayo and Dr. George B. Martin, chairman of the board's discipline 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
The four cases were among nine on which the board criticized the 59-year-old 
family doctor, citing records provided by the health maintenance organization. 
Group Health submitted copies of its internal review of Mayo to the board in 
1987, about the time Mayo left to go into private practice. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't like he had nothing but problems," Group Health spokeswoman Pam 
Effertz said. "He was getting good results with many patients. As a matter of 
fact, some people will tell you what a caring doctor he was, and how he would 
give some elderly patients a ride home himself." 
</P>
<P>
Mayo said he felt "put upon," and that his famous name was a factor in the 
review.

GERMANYS BEGIN UNIFICATION TALKS;

MEETINGS WITH WORLD WAR II VICTORS TO START NEXT WEEK

<TEXT>
<P>
The two Germanys today began preliminary unification talks, preparing for next 
week's meeting with the four World War II allies on German unity. 
</P>
<P>
Ernst Krabatsch, East Germany's deputy foreign minister, was meeting with 
Dieter Kastrup, head of the political department at West Germany's Foreign 
Ministry. They declined to comment to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The election commission, meanwhile, said 24 political parties will contest East 
Germany's first free elections on March 18, the ADN news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Commission spokeswoman Petra Blaess said the final list includes the 
Communists, now renamed the Party for Democratic Socialism; the Social 
Democrats; the liberal Free Democrats; and the Alliance for Germany, a 
conservative coalition backed by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian 
Democratic Union. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany's 12.2 million eligible voters will seat a new Parliament with 400 
members, 100 fewer than the current People's Chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Today's discussions are part of the so-called "two-plus-four" formula of 
unification negotiations agreed to in Ottawa last month. Under that formula the 
two German nations are to discuss the domestic aspects of unification. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday in Bonn, the two Germanys are scheduled to meet with low-level 
officials from the four World War II victors -- the Soviet Union, the United 
States, Britain and France -- for initial talks on how unification would affect 
European security and the concerns of other nations. 
</P>
<P>
Although the talks come barely a week before March 18 elections that are 
expected to remove East Germany's Communist government from power, the East 
Berlin government is carrying out the dialogue with the approval of 15 other 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
The four World War II powers have given their blessing to the idea of German 
unification, but enormous problems need to be overcome. 
</P>
<P>
One of the thorniest stems from Moscow's insistence that a united Germany not 
be a NATO member. Kohl on Thursday reassured NATO members in Brussels of West 
Germany's wish for the new country to remain in the Western alliance. 
</P>
<P>
"We will continue talks on all levels. Nobody need fear Germany will go its own 
way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Poland on Thursday reiterated its demand for a role in the talks, 
despite a vote by West Germany's Parliament that a united Germany should honor 
Poland's western border. About a third of Poland was German territory before 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl has come under fire abroad and at home for his previous reluctance to 
unequivocally state that a united Germany would never lay claim to land ceded 
to Poland after the Third Reich's 1945 defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl, apparently trying to avoid offending conservative voters before federal 
elections in December, had insisted that only the government of a united 
Germany could address the matter.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hundreds of people, some throwing rocks, blocked streets in the capital today 
on the fourth day of protests triggered by the army's killing of a schoolgirl. 
</P>
<P>
The normally bustling Port-au-Prince, a city of 1 million, was virtually 
deserted this morning, with schools and stores closed. Protesters blocked all 
main streets, and rocks were thrown at cars on the seafront. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, thousands of people demonstrated in the capital and several 
provincial towns, setting fires and calling for the resignation of Haiti's 
military leader, Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril. 
</P>
<P>
Three people were killed in the protests Thursday, including a soldier beaten 
to death by a mob, independent radio reports said. Fifteen people were injured 
in clashes with soldiers, according to witnesses and a doctor at the state 
hospital in Port-au-Prince. 
</P>
<P>
The government has made no comment on the unrest, but a high-ranking government 
official said today that Avril has no plans to resign. 
</P>
<P>
"Avril is ready to make concessions, but a hasty departure is out of the 
question," said the official, speaking on condition he not be further 
identified. He gave no indication what concessions were contemplated. 
</P>
<P>
Avril indicated Wednesday he would resign if it was "the will of the people" 
but said that would cause "revolution and chaos." 
</P>
<P>
The protests were triggered by the killing of 11-year-old Rosaline Vaval Monday 
in the town of Petit Goave, where 10,000 mourners attended her burial Thursday. 
The girl was shot by a soldier breaking up an anti-government demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
Radio Lumiere, a Protestant radio station, said today that a mob went on a 
rampage in Petit Goave, a town of 15,000, on Tuesday night, burning an army 
outpost, ransacking a government building and the mayor's house. 
</P>
<P>
In Gonaives, a western port city of 40,000, mobs plundered the house of Mayor 
Alexandre Louissaint, a Baptist pastor, and ransacked his church and a 
government building, according to a resident who spoke anonymously. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, about 3,000 people, shouting "Liberty!" and slogans against Avril, 
marched on the Presidential Palace in Port-au-Prince. Soldiers then fired in 
the air and beat demonstrators with billy clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"The will of the people is for Avril to step down," said a communique released 
Thursday night by a coalition of 11 opposition parties that earlier had called 
on Haitians to rise against the military government.

Reckitt and Colman PLC, a British food and household goods group, has agreed to 
pay $1.25 billion for the Boyle-Midway home products unit of New York-based 
American Home Products Corp., the companies said today. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition of Boyle-Midway, whose products include Woolite laundry soap 
and Easy-Off oven cleaner, would make Reckitt and Colman a major international 
household products manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
Boyle-Midway is about half the size of Reckitt and Colman's household products 
and toiletries division. Boyle-Midway had $667 million in sales last year in 
the United States, Canada, France, West Germany and Spain and a pretax profit 
of $91 million, the companies said.

Hughes Aircraft Co. today pleaded guilty to two felony counts of unlawfully 
obtaining classified Pentagon budget documents and agreed to pay more than 
$3.55 million to settle the case. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes is the fourth major defense contractor to plead guilty through a plea 
bargain to similar charges under an investigation begun in the mid-1980s by the 
Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the investigative arm of the defense 
inspector general. 
</P>
<P>
The two counts concern five-year defense program documents issued in 1983 and 
1984 summarizing resources planned, programmed and budgeted by the Department 
of Defense. 
</P>
<P>
The three other major defense contractors that previously pleaded guilty to 
similar charges are GTE Government Systems Division, which paid about $300,000; 
Boeing, which paid $5.2 million, and RCA Corp., which paid $2.5 million.

FEBRUARY'S JOBLESS RATE HOLDS AT 5.3%; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: UNEMPLOYMENT REMAINED STEADY FOR THE NINTH MONTH DESPITE THE BIGGEST 
INCREASE IN JOBS IN 20 MONTHS.

<P>
The nation's unemployment rate in February held steady at 5.3% for the ninth 
consecutive month despite the biggest increase in jobs in 20 months, the 
government said today. 
</P>
<P>
California's rate was 4.9%, down from 5.2% in January. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, the Labor Department said a survey of employers showed a 
seasonally-adjusted, non-farm job gain of 372,000, the largest since June, 
1988. And the department revised its figure for January to a gain of 332,000, 
up from an earlier estimate of 275,000. 
</P>
<P>
February marked the first increase in factory jobs in 11 months. Manufacturing 
payrolls added 90,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is good news on the jobs front," said Michael Boskin, chairman of the 
White House Council of Economic Advisers. "We believe the economy, after a 
period of pretty slow growth, is likely to show progress (in) 1990." 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department cautioned that the job gain was heavily influenced by 
temporary factors and probably overstates the underlying strength of the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
About all of the manufacturing increase was attributed to the return of auto 
workers after a temporary layoff in January. Factory employment elsewhere was 
lackluster. 
</P>
<P>
Construction payrolls swelled by 60,000 jobs, the result of unusually mild 
weather for most of February. 
</P>
<P>
"It is possible, however, that the higher-than-usual activity in the beginning 
months of the year could result in fewer new hires during the traditional 
spring construction buildup," Labor Statistics Commissioner Janet L. Norwood 
warned the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate for auto workers, which had zoomed to 20% in January, 
fell back to 8% last month. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, total civilian employment edged up to 118 million. The jobless 
numbered 6.6 million, about the same as January. 
</P>
<P>
The service sector of the economy added 221,00 jobs, including a gain of 47,000 
for health services, 28,000 in government, 17,000 in retail trade and 15,000 in 
finance real estate and insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Norwood said government payrolls were bolstered in January and February by the 
addition of about 20,000 census workers. Several hundred thousand additional 
workers will be added in the next few months, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Average hourly earnings posted a 0.6% rise in February to $9.87, up from $9.52 
a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Over the rest of this year, many economists forecast a rise in unemployment, 
but not a big one. The consensus of 51 economists surveyed by the Sedona, 
Ariz.-based Blue Chip Economic Indicators was for a 5.6% rate this year. 
</P>
<P>
That is a shade less optimistic than the Bush Administration, which expects a 
5.4% rate.

The exhibition, titled "Twenty Years of Passion," opened Thursday and will run 
through April 13. Proceeds from the sale of the show's catalogue will be 
donated to the Assn. for Cancer Research. 
</P>
<P>
"This collection came about through love and passion, and not in a commercial 
or speculative spirit," Delon said. 
</P>
<P>
The collection includes works by Braque, Toulouse-Lautrec, Delacroix and Millet 
and animal sculpture by Rembrandt Bugatti.

Opera will be performed in the heart of the Amazon rain forest for the first 
time in more than 80 years when the legendary Teatro Amazonas reopens March 17 
after a three-year, $8-million restoration. 
</P>
<P>
The theater was built in the city of Manaus in 1896 at the height of Brazil's 
rubber boom. 
</P>
<P>
The rubber barons, who spoke French and sent their linen shirt cuffs to Lisbon 
to be laundered, spared no expense in building and furnishing the theater, 
believing their wealth would last forever. 
</P>
<P>
Opera companies from Spain, Italy and Portugal traveled across the Atlantic to 
perform in Manaus. 
</P>
<P>
The theater, however, staged its last opera in 1907, when Brazilian rubber 
began losing its markets to Far Eastern exporters. Teatro Amazonas then fell 
prey to termites and tropical storms. 
</P>
<P>
The latest renovation of the theater is its fourth, but it has not been used 
for opera since the 1907 closing. 
</P>
<P>
Opening night will feature excerpts of "Guarany," an opera by Carlos Gomes; the 
last scene of the Villa-Lobos ballet "Amazon Forest," danced by Brazil's 
premiere ballerina, Marcia Haydee, and a symphonic presentation of the poem 
"Statutes of Man," written by Amazonian composer Claudio Santoro. President 
Fernando Collor de Mello will attend opening night.

relations than ending the lockout of major league camps, today held a news 
briefing to explain their latest proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The Player Relations Committee said the owners' latest proposal would raise the 
salary of players with more than two and less than three years' service an 
average of $60,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
The key issue in the labor dispute has been salary arbitration. The union wants 
players with two years of service eligible for arbitration, while the owners 
want to keep the current system that makes players wait for three seasons 
before they can seek arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
The Players Assn. scheduled an afternoon news conference to discuss the dispute 
that has resulted in a 23-day spring training lockout. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Fay Vincent failed in a bid Thursday to bring the sides together. 
The owners agreed to his plan but the union dismissed it as a "staged media 
event." 
</P>
<P>
Trying to salvage Opening Day on April 2, Vincent asked the 26 club owners to 
open the camps in Florida and Arizona if the players would pledge not to strike 
during the season. 
</P>
<P>
Owners agreed within moments, but union chief Don Fehr refused to even dignify 
the idea. Without explicitly rejecting the overture, Fehr complained that 
owners failed to formally notify him. He said if they ever did, he would 
respond. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate we are at this place," Fehr said, blistering his foes with 
sarcastic references to press releases and their "terrificly successful 
lockout." 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't a proposal," he said. "If it was a proposal, they would have told 
us about it first. They didn't bother to tell us about it first, 'cause they 
know the answer." 
</P>
<P>
Added union official Gene Orza, "No self-respecting union gives away the right 
to strike." 
</P>
<P>
The union's response darkened the outlook for playing Opening Day as scheduled. 
Bud Selig, Milwaukee Brewers owner and chairman of management's labor 
committee, said the lockout would remain in place unless the union offered a 
no-strike pledge. 
</P>
<P>
Fehr gave no such pledge, but he refused to rule out further talks. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Yaverbaum of New York, co-founder of Strike Back, an organization founded 
in the 1985 labor dispute, said his group has received 9,200 letters from "very 
aggravated baseball fans."

Authorities in Davenport, Iowa, have dropped an assault charge against 
middleweight champion Michael Nunn in a neighborhood fracas, and the prosecutor 
insists he treated Nunn just as he would any other defendant. Nunn, the 
International Boxing Federation champion, was arrested Oct. 1 and charged with 
simple assault after a neighborhood street brawl in which his mother and nephew 
also were arrested. Earlier, Nunn said he was wrong to swear at a policeman but 
that he was innocent of assault.

Hank Gathers was remembered by former teammates at a memorial gathering today 
as a hard-working player who loved the game of basketball. 
</P>
<P>
About 500 Murrell Dobbins Technical High School students attended the memorial 
for Gathers, a standout for Loyola Marymount, who collapsed and died during a 
game Sunday. He was 23. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't back down from no one, he didn't walk behind no one," said Doug 
Overton, who was a teammate of Gathers when Dobbins won the Philadelphia Public 
League championship in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Overton now plays at La Salle. 
</P>
<P>
Another former teammate, Horace Owens, talked of the love Gathers had for 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"No game was too big for him to play in, no game was too small for him to play 
in. 'Let's play one more game' -- that was Hank" Owens said. 
</P>
<P>
La Salle player Lionel Simmons dedicated the rest of his season to the memory 
of Gathers. LaSalle has finished the regular season and won a berth in the NCAA 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"He was definitely the hardest working player I have ever seen," Simmons said. 
"He always wanted to do better, not just in basketball but in life. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe this could happen to someone who worked so hard. . . . It 
makes you think about life," he said. "It shows that someone so good, so great 
can still have it all taken away." 
</P>
<P>
LaSalle Coach Speedy Morris and Temple Coach John Chaney called Gathers an 
example of what Philadelphia's youth can be if they apply themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Chaney said it was a joy "to watch Hank at the mini-camps, the way he expressed 
himself while hoping to create a better life for others." 
</P>
<P>
None of Gathers' immediate family attended the morning ceremony, but about a 
dozen cousins accepted several school and city plaques in his honor. Gathers' 
great aunt, Doris Neal, also attended the memorial. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the audience, many wearing Dobbins' colors red and gray, were 
solemn, many breaking into tears when the school's gospel choir sang, "It's so 
hard to say goodby to yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
Gathers' immediate family arrived with his body from the West Coast late 
Thursday night but declined to comment at Philadelphia International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Gathers' teammates at Loyola-Marymount plan to fly to Philadelphia 
Sunday for his funeral services Monday.

STRAWBERRY WON'T FACE L.A. CHARGE

New York Mets outfielder Darryl Strawberry will not face a weapons charge in 
connection with his arrest during a domestic dispute in January, the Los 
Angeles city attorney's office said today. 
</P>
<P>
An alcohol problem was the root of Strawberry's domestic problem and the 
ballplayer was in a recovery program, the prosecutor's office said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors concluded there was insufficient evidence to support any weapons 
charges against Strawberry, 27, who was booked for investigation of assault 
with a deadly weapon Jan. 26 after a dispute at his Encino home. 
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by the office of City Atty. James K. Hahn said the 
conclusion was reached after hearings involving Strawberry's wife, Lisa, 25, 
and her mother, Virginia Andrews, and "frank" discussion with Strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation was concluded, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Strawberry was especially frank with us in discussing both the incident, 
the events leading up to the incident and his problems with alcohol which, in 
our judgment, lies at the root of the family problems which resulted in his 
arrest," the prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
"He has now completed the initial step of his recovery program. Therefore, we 
do not intend to file misdemeanor spousal battery charges at this time. Rather, 
in conjunction with Dr. Allan Lans, the director of the Mets Assistance 
Program, Mr. Strawberry has agreed to provide us with biweekly written progress 
reports for three months. 
</P>
<P>
"During this time, he will continue counseling for his alcohol problem and 
begin family counseling. After three months, we will assess the need for 
further monthly reports through the end of the year." 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's office said it was supportive of efforts by individuals to 
deal with "the problems of chemical dependency which invariably lead to acts of 
violence." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Strawberry's arrest, the city attorney's office received a signed 
statement from his wife saying she did not want him to be prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Strawberry and her mother, who witnessed part of the altercation, met with 
a city attorney hearing officer Feb. 9. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Qualls, a Hahn spokesman, said one purpose of those meetings was to 
determine if Lisa Strawberry told police of her own free will that she did not 
want to press charges. Qualls said today that it was determined that she had. 
</P>
<P>
About a week after the incident, Strawberry said he had a problem with alcohol 
and admitted himself to the Smithers Institute in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets said Strawberry was en route today to the club's training complex in 
Port St. Lucie, Fla.

A federal judge today consolidated lawsuits by Donald Trump and Don King 
against James (Buster) Douglas and scheduled a trial for next month on their 
claims to Douglas' first fight as heavyweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet of Manhattan tentatively set the trial for 
April 16 but said it could start earlier if his schedule allowed. 
</P>
<P>
In their lawsuits, Trump and King claim they have a contract to promote 
Douglas' first fight, which they say will be a rematch with Mike Tyson June 18 
at the Trump Plaza in Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
Their actions were in response to a lawsuit against King brought in Las Vegas 
by Steve Wynn, who wants to promote Douglas' first fight at his Mirage 
Casino-Hotel in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The Trump-King lawsuits also name the Mirage and Douglas' manager, John 
Johnson, as defendants.

'MOLECULAR SCISSORS': NEW HOPE FOR AIDS; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: THE ARTIFICIALLY PREPARED FORM OF RNA INTERFERES WITH THE INFECTION 
OF CELLS BY THE VIRUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An innovative "molecular scissors" that interferes with the infection of cells 
by the AIDS virus has been developed by researchers at the City of Hope 
National Medical Center in Duarte. 
</P>
<P>
Molecular geneticist John J. Rossi and his colleagues report today in the 
journal Science that they have used a specially prepared form of RNA 
(ribonucleic acid) to create the scissors, which snips apart the virus' own RNA 
before it can be used as a blueprint for replication of the virus. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists have already inserted a gene for the artificially prepared RNA, 
called a ribozyme, into cultured human cells and shown that it sharply reduces 
infection of the cells, which should halt the progression of the disease. They 
are now working with Vestar Corp. of San Dimas to develop a way to deliver the 
ribozymes into the white blood cells of AIDS victims, where it would halt the 
replication of the virus. 
</P>
<P>
Nava Sarver, who is in charge of the National Institutes of Health's program 
for rapid development of new AIDS therapies, predicted that human trials could 
begin in as little as three years. 
</P>
<P>
The principal advantage of the technique is that it is extremely selective in 
its activity, attacking only the viral RNA and leaving the cell's own genetic 
materials intact. This approach to therapy should therefore produce virtually 
no side effects, unlike currently used drugs such as AZT. 
</P>
<P>
Many researchers believe that this approach may ultimately provide a completely 
new way to attack all kinds of viral infections, which are now almost 
impossible to treat. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a promising approach," said molecular biologist Sidney Altman of Yale 
University, "but we have to keep in mind that every year many promising 
approaches are discarded because they don't work." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps ironically, the lineage of the ribozymes that would be used to attack 
humanity's newest infectious nemesis can be traced back to the oldest molecules 
on Earth, the ones that were present when life first arose. 
</P>
<P>
Many researchers now believe that the first life on Earth was composed entirely 
of RNA, which combined the functions of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), which 
carries the genetic information necessary for life, and proteins, such as 
enzymes, which carry out the biochemical functions necessary for life. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, researchers had believed that the primary function of RNA -- except 
for a few viruses, such as the AIDS virus -- was to serve as an intermediate 
between DNA and proteins. RNA provides a sort of working blueprint for cellular 
machinery, a copy of genetic information from DNA that is used in the 
production of proteins. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, however, Altman and molecular biologist Thomas Cech of the 
University of Colorado in Boulder independently discovered that RNA could act 
in the same fashion as enzymes, cutting apart RNA and moving it around in 
cells. Their discovery earned them the 1989 Nobel Prize for Chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately, many researchers saw the ribozymes as a new way to attack viruses 
and began developing ways to use them. Rossi and his colleagues are apparently 
the first to report success. 
</P>
<P>
Rossi and his associates took a fragment of RNA -- the "scissors" portion of 
the molecule -- from a plant and combined it with an artificially synthesized 
RNA fragment that would bind only to RNA that serves as a blueprint for a 
protein crucial to replication of the AIDS virus (which is known formally as 
the human immunodeficiency virus or HIV). 
</P>
<P>
In the test tube, they found that the ribozyme thus produced would in fact bind 
to the target RNA from the AIDS virus and cut it. 
</P>
<P>
They next used genetic engineering techniques to insert the gene for the 
ribozyme into human cells grown in a test tube. The cells produced the ribozyme 
and, when the researchers infected the cells with HIV, the ribozyme prevented 
the virus from reproducing and spreading. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, he said, the ribozyme "only targets what you ask it to target. 
And it's a natural molecule, so the cell sees it only as RNA, not as a toxic 
drug." 
</P>
<P>
Vestar and a half-dozen other companies around the country are developing a 
promising new way to deliver ribozymes. They encapsulate the ribozyme in an 
artificial sphere, about one-hundredth the size of a red blood cell, called a 
liposome. 
</P>
<P>
The liposome is composed of naturally occurring fat molecules that surround the 
drug to be carried and protect it from degradation in the blood stream. 
Theliposomes are also readily taken up by cells, so they provide a method of 
injecting the drug into target cells. Inside the cell, the fat molecules are 
absorbed, freeing the drug. 
</P>
<P>
The liposomes, like the ribozymes, are still largely experimental, although 
Vestar just received approval in Italy to market an anti-fungal agent carried 
by lipsomes. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, said biochemist Sean Sullivan of Vestar, a great deal of testing 
will be required before the technique can be studied in humans. "But in all 
fairness to NIH and FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration), any 
therapeutic that looks promising gets put on a fairly fast track. So the 
process could be accelerated."
