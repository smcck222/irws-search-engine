NBC's "Sunday Night" is a fine program. It concentrates on music and features 
the best musicians, many of whom are seldom seen on television. I hope the 
program continues.

In an age of television programming that concentrates on the sensational and 
short interest-span production, it was indeed moving to see "The Fulfillment of 
Mary Gray," a heartfelt story shown on CBS. The acting was superb, as was the 
photography. Most rewarding was the attention paid in great detail to authentic 
dance music of the period, costuming, old-time outdoor picnics and the actual 
use of old farm implements, wagons, cornhusking machines, plows and even an 
antique hat pin holder on the dresser. This attention to detail will stay with 
us forever.

My husband and I would like to voice our appreciation of "Murphy's Law." The 
stories are well-written, the characters have lots of charm, interest and 
believability, and all the actors portraying the leads are terrific. George 
Segal is wonderful, as usual, but the others are truly entertaining.

The title of a movie recently shown on KCOP was "Warriors." It dealt with gang 
control of areas, control of gang members by violent leaders, etc. As as 
administrator of a middle school in an area troubled by similar problems, I 
question the motives of the station's programmers. How can my students' parents 
and I convey to our youth that gangs are not OK when this is the offering 
available to them? TV viewing can be educational. Viewing selectively can be 
positive. I think that station programmers have a moral responsibility to 
support positive attributes of our society and oppose those of detrimental 
value.

"The Measure of a Man," the Feb. 19 episode of "Star Trek: The Next 
Generation," was wonderful. Fascinating . . . intriguing . . . superb . . . 
beautiful -- it was all these and much, much more. Not since "City on the Edge 
of Forever" has "Star Trek" produced such a heart-rending and heartwarming 
show.

Despite the blockbuster success of the miniseries "Lonesome Dove," the three 
networks have just finished the lowest-rated February sweeps in their history. 
All the records the networks are setting in television these days seem to be 
new lows. 
</P>
<P>
February is one of four months annually when the Nielsen and Arbitron ratings 
services take particularly intensive surveys, and the results are used in 
determining advertising rates. The most important sweeps are in February and 
November. 
</P>
<P>
The combined three-network rating for February was down almost four points from 
the same month last year. The total average share for the three networks -- the 
number of TV sets that were tuned to ABC, CBS and NBC -- stood at 69 percent. 
That means that more TV viewers than ever were watching something else. 
</P>
<P>
Is there a way for the networks to put a rosy filter over these downbeat 
numbers? "We consider them almost a blessing," says David M. Poltrack, a CBS 
vice president who is the king of network research. Poltrack says that even 
though the total network numbers are down, CBS actually improved on its 
performance over last year. So, whoopee. 
</P>
<P>
"The numbers are very positive from CBS' point of view," Poltrack says. "We're 
up in every single day part." Day parts are what networks divide the broadcast 
day into: daytime, prime time, late night, and so on. Though still locked in 
third place, CBS improved on last year's February sweeps by 7 percent. NBC was 
up 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
ABC was down 31 percent, but Poltrack says that figure is misleading because 
last February, ABC had two weeks of Winter Olympics coverage, making its 
ratings unusually high. 
</P>
<P>
It gets complicated, doesn't it? And television is a business in which there 
are an infinite number of ways to lie, or at least fib, with statistics. If 
your show gets a lousy rating, you can always say it gets great "demographics" 
-- that it's doing well with women 18-to-25, for instance, or with midgets 
making more than $40,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The networks are pitiful helpless giants watching much of their audience take a 
hike. But in their defense, there's no way of knowing how much of the latest 
hike-taking can be traced to last year's writers' strike, which disrupted and 
delayed the new fall prime-time schedules. 
</P>
<P>
"We are gradually recovering from the strike, and it hurt us worse than we 
thought it would," says Poltrack. "I personally believe we will never fully 
recover, that we have permanently lost one full share point as a result." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the strike and the abundance of reruns on the networks, viewers went 
wandering last fall. Among the places they landed is the fledgling Fox Network, 
which has fewer stations than any of the big three but which continues to score 
solid gains on Sunday nights, especially with the corrosive sitcom "Married . . 
. With Children." 
</P>
<P>
For CBS, meanwhile, the miniseries "Lonesome Dove" was a boon, doing better in 
the ratings than CBS had promised advertisers, and, more importantly, giving 
network television a shot in the arm. 
</P>
<P>
"It sort of brought people back to network television and got people talking 
about it again," Poltrack says. "It really was the first big event since the 
strike to do that. Normally it happens in the fall when the new shows are 
introduced, but this year, we lost that." 
</P>
<P>
Poltrack thinks that "Lonesome Dove" lured not only viewers who normally don't 
watch the networks, but also enticed "the upper socioeconomic audience" that 
normally "isn't watching television at all." The four-night Western spectacular 
proved to be "a tremendous psychological rallying point for CBS," Poltrack 
says. 
</P>
<P>
The network is otherwise experiencing a season of embarrassing clunkers and 
dismal flops. 
</P>
<P>
Figures from the February sweeps will be analyzed, dissected, stood on their 
heads and turned inside out. Independent stations, those not affiliated with 
any network, will claim a great victory because the network share is down 
again, but the independents as a group were up only two-tenths of a rating 
point from last February's results. 
</P>
<P>
While the number-crunchers hunch over their computers and the sales departments 
figure out how to bend and shape them and beat them into meaninglessness (and 
that may not be too hard to do), the lesson of "Lonesome Dove" would seem to be 
a simple one: 
</P>
<P>
Put on better programs, and more people will want to watch them.

Brian Keith, the former star of "Hardcastle &amp; McCormick" and "Family 
Affair," is starring in "Heartland," a new series for CBS premiering March 20 
at 8:30 p.m. He plays what the network describes as "an old and crusty but 
lovable small-town bigot who has something insulting to say about everyone." 
Yes, this is a comedy, set on a farm in Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
People: Don Rickles and Ed McMahon make guest appearances on "Newhart" Monday. 
. . . Following in the footsteps of Stephanie Beacham, who transferred her 
character Sable from the late "Colbys" series to "Dynasty," Tracy Scoggins 
joins the cast of the ABC soap on Thursday, again playing Monica Colby. . . . 
Rock singer Pat Benatar makes her acting debut in "Stepfather," an "ABC 
Afterschool Special" due to air April 20. 
</P>
<P>
The USA Network has lined up Keith Carradine, Stacy Keach and Steve Railsback 
for the first of its 24 original cable movies. The film is called "The 
Forgotten" and concerns six Green Berets who are finally released by the 
Vietnamese government, only to discover that their troubles aren't over. It was 
written by Railsback and Keach's brother, James, who also is directing. 
</P>
<P>
"The New Card Sharks" has been handed its walking papers by CBS. It will be 
replaced April 3 by a new game show, "Now You See It," in which contestants 
must find words hidden in a grid of letters. It will be hosted by Chuck Henry. 
</P>
<P>
Reviving their former TV series in a two-hour TV movie are Bill Bixby and Lou 
Ferrigno, who will star in "The Trial of the Incredible Hulk" for NBC. Bixby is 
the movie's director and executive producer too.

STANDING UP TO JAPAN;

AMERICA CAN REVERSE ITS DECLINE THE AMERICAN WAY, NOT BY COPYING THE JAPANESE

past three years. This article is adapted from his book More Like Us: Making

CALIFORNIANS MAY think they're part of the new Pacific Rim, even its leaders. 
But what does the Pa cific Rim think of them? 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, California in general, and greater Los Angeles in particular, 
still represent the pinnacle of glamour and excitement. Half of the commercials 
on Japanese TV seem to have been filmed on Southland beaches, among the 
roller-skaters of Venice or in mansions in Beverly Hills. Half the cars on the 
road in Kuala Lumpur have "L.A. -- I'm on My Way!" bumper stickers, put there 
when Malaysian Airlines inaugurated its Kuala Lumpur-Los Angeles route. I've 
seen "California Style" used as an advertising slogan, a restaurant name and a 
general classy motto practically everywhere in Asia, including China. 
</P>
<P>
But there is another edge to the fascination with California, which is an 
intensified version of the Asian interest in America as a whole. Carefree and 
exciting California may be -- but, Asians say to themselves, isn't it also 
becoming decadent and over the hill? Asians often regards Californians in the 
way that nice, wholesome middle-class teen-agers look on the rock singer Prince 
or on the dope-head rock groups of yesteryear: diverting, because they are so 
naughty and irresponsible but not any guide as to how to build a stable future 
for yourself. Let's watch the Californians frolic in the sun for a while, the 
Koreans, Taiwanese and Japanese seem to say. Then we'll head back to the 
library and the workshop. 
</P>
<P>
In January, after Emperor Hirohito's death, Japanese TV ran round-the-clock 
newsreels of the early days of his reign, including Japan's attempt to erect a 
puppet state in Manchuria in the 1930s. The relentlessly sober-minded 
documentaries drove millions of people to Japan's video-rental stores, which 
did their biggest-ever business in the two days after Hirohito's death. But 
they also prompted the inevitable jokes about how Japan could avoid such 
mistakes in the future. "Next time, no Italians!" a Japanese man says to a 
German in a standard joke about the weak link in the World War II Axis lineup. 
"California will be our new Manchuria -- this time without guns," goes another 
line. 
</P>
<P>
The very things that seem exciting about California -- and by extension, 
America -- also look like its fatal weaknesses to those on the other side of 
the Pacific. Californians are casual, they are fun-loving, they are open-minded 
-- and that's why Asians can sell them so many VCRs and buy so much of their 
real estate. (Although the Japanese shrink from the thought of buying or eating 
rice grown in any alien soil, several Japanese sake breweries are doing a 
handsome business in California's Central Valley, using California rice.) 
California is dreamland, rather than work-land, which is why Asians believe 
they are bound to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond this conception is the very Asian idea that cultural values, rather than 
government policies or straightforward business decisions, are the ultimate 
reasons for a society's economic success. Why has Japan come so far in the 
semiconductor business? One columnist recently declared in a major Tokyo paper 
that it is because of the Japanese /Shinto custom of "cleanliness and 
purification." When chips passed the "1-micron barrier" in miniaturization, he 
said, Westerners, with their different, impure traditions, simply couldn't keep 
up. Behind this idea, in turn, is the firm belief that the distinctive cultural 
traits of Japanese, Korean and Chinese societies now constitute a huge 
competitive advantage -- Confucian-based traits such as obedience, reverence 
for tradition and fierce loyalty to the family, which in the case of Japan 
extends to the nation-family as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more than any nation on earth, Japan has succeeded by making sure that 
people stick to their proper place in the great national hierarchy. Even now, 
at least 25% of Japanese marriages are "arranged," to ensure that partners meet 
others from the proper social and economic level. Even now, most promotions 
within companies are made on the basis of seniority -- as at a boarding school 
where members of each class lord it over the ones below them while fighting 
among themselves for positions as class officers. It is all but impossible for 
professional workers to switch from one large company to another after their 
mid-20s, or for women to find a place in the corporate world. Whether or not it 
pleases the individual Japanese worker, the system has undeniably been useful 
in building Japan's trade surpluses. Factories run more smoothly when no one 
dreams of challenging the boss. 
</P>
<P>
Californians aspire toward just the opposite traits, summed up as "I gotta be 
me." Therefore, in the Asian view, California and the nation it's attached to 
are doomed to decline. In three years of interviewing Japanese and Koreans, 
I've heard "American decline" and "lazy Americans" used so often that the words 
seem to form natural compounds, like "brazen hussy" or "fellow traveler." 
</P>
<P>
But the Asian theory of "American decline" is dangerous, since everyone 
involved may find it too convincing. For the Japanese, the main risk is of 
becoming too contemptuous of the America they now believe they have defeated 
economically. For Americans, the risk is that we may come to scorn what is most 
important and valuable in our national character. If the Japanese and other 
Asians have piled up such vast profits and controlled such ever-growing market 
shares, shouldn't we try to be more like them? 
</P>
<P>
No, we shouldn't. Japan and Korea may be successes on their own terms, and 
there are certain policies and institutions that might set valuable examples 
for the United States. The very high personal-savings rate in Japan and Korea, 
for example, may have something to do with quasi-Confucian values, but it is 
more obviously and immediately influenced by tax laws, meager public pensions 
and other factors that give people a strong incentive to save. Similar policies 
might have a similar effect in America, but the basic values of Asian cultures 
cannot be exported to ours. Discipline, order and obedience may be appropriate 
values for some Asian societies, but they would spell only stagnation for 
America. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, American society is as healthily unstable as ever before. From 
the beginning, the genius of America has lain in exactly the traits that make 
Southern California distinctive now: the lack of tradition, the freedom for 
people to start over, the influx of people looking for a better life than what 
they had in Saigon, Sonora or Schenectady. Throughout the 19th Century, 
European visitors to America described Philadelphia, Baltimore and Cincinnati 
in just the terms that have been applied to Los Angeles in the past generation: 
There was no downtown, no established institutions, no standards of taste or 
dress (but lots of wacky religions). All these, of course, were signs of a 
society rapidly reinventing itself and making room for newcomers. What it lacks 
in good taste it makes up for in sheer energy, which is the story of America 
throughout its history and of Southern California now. Only in such 
circumstances could the real American dream take hold: the idea that people 
could keep having second chances until the day they die. (The idea of endless 
possibility was a powerful but rarely discussed element in Ronald Reagan's 
popularity, I believe. He was washed up in his late 40s, yet still he would be 
able to invent a new life for himself.) 
</P>
<P>
This part of the California story has been intensely important to me, since it 
was the plot line of my family's life. Just after the Korean War, my parents 
moved from the suburbs of Philadelphia, where they'd both grown up, to 
Redlands, in the part of San Bernardino County that likes to call itself the 
"Inland Empire." They brought three preschool children along with them, one of 
whom was me; they also brought a belief that they could invent a new life for 
themselves in an environment where they had no background, no connections, no 
obligations. This is the California cliche: the new start in the new land. 
</P>
<P>
There is, of course, a vulgar side to the California cliche, which writer Joan 
Didion once vividly described. In the mid-1960s, Didion came to my beloved 
hometown to cover a lurid murder trial. The Inland Empire, as she portrayed it, 
became a kind of co-defendant in the case. The small-town Southern California 
culture, she said, amounted to "the last stop for all those who came from 
somewhere else, for all those who drifted away from the cold and the past and 
the old ways. . . . This is the country of the teased hair and the Capris and 
the girls for whom all life's promise comes down to a waltz-length white 
wedding dress and the birth of a Kimberly or Sherri or a Debbi and a Tijuana 
divorce and a return to hairdressers' school. . . . The future always looks 
good in the golden land, because no one remembers the past." 
</P>
<P>
What Didion wrote was accurate enough, but it was not the only meaning of the 
no-tradition, wide-open Southern California life. There was another side to it 
that was not contemptible -- that was, in fact, magnificent, because it went 
far toward freeing people from the constraints of class. In a small town like 
Redlands, where there was only one public high school (and few parents even 
thought of private school), there was a limit to how far one social class could 
separate itself from another. My schoolmates in the 1950s and 1960s included 
people who ended up as auto dealers, doctors, labor organizers, actors in TV 
commercials, blackjack dealers, schoolteachers, rock musicians, tennis coaches, 
bartenders, orange growers, librarians, contractors and art historians. They 
obviously had different amounts of money and different chances in life, but 
social pressures minimized rather than exaggerated that distance. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Bonfire of the Vanities," Tom Wolfe wrote that "insulation" is the key 
to an endurable life in New York: If you separate yourself from everyone who is 
unlike you, you can survive. In small towns like mine, the insulation was 
stripped off. People dressed the same and had similar manners and drove similar 
cars. People spoke with more or less the same accent -- a phenomenon that I, 
like most Californians, took entirely for granted until I went off to 
universities, first in Boston and then in England. In the old cities of the 
East Coast, as in much of the Old World, people's accents told their life 
story. The instant someone opened his mouth, you had a good idea of how much 
money his parents made, whether he'd been to college, where he'd end up in 
life. Small-town California had its class barriers, of course, but its 
appearance of democracy reduced their importance. Because it seemed more fair, 
it was more fair. More people were encouraged to think they had a chance. They 
tried harder and rose higher than they would have if people continually had 
their noses rubbed into the inborn differences that come from social standing. 
</P>
<P>
More than any other nation, the United States has thrived by making its society 
flexible. The most daring step toward flexibility, our ultimate weapon against 
the Asian economies, is one that most Americans barely notice: the idea that 
people can come from foreign cultures and voluntarily make themselves 
Americans, without relying on the ethnic bonds that hold most other societies 
together. The most controversial aspect of today's immigration -- the question 
of Spanish-language separatism -- only emphasizes how unusual and optimistic 
the American attitude is. In most Asian countries, people wouldn't care what 
language the newcomers spoke: They would object to them on purely ethnic 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
But two forces threaten to make our society more rigid than it has been before. 
One, of course, is the growing exclusion of an urban black underclass, with 
less and less connection, except via crime, to anyone else's lives. The other 
is a change in American education, but not the one discussed in the typical 
"Crisis in Our Schools" report. It is the rise of a status system based on 
intelligence, education and academic credentials, which has created another 
form of American snobbery, another kind of caste division. 
</P>
<P>
This new status system is related to some of the more familiar forms of 
snobbery, since people with the most money and with what are considered the 
best family and racial backgrounds usually have the most education, too. But it 
has special dangers. Discrimination based on intelligence seems more legitimate 
than other forms. Most college graduates try to conceal their racial or 
religious prejudices but are not embarrassed to sneer at high-school dropouts. 
A social hierarchy built largely on academic degrees is fine for Asia. Everyone 
understands and accepts the ranking system -- the mandarins of China, after 
all, were those who knew more written characters than anyone else. Even now, 
the commanding heights of Japanese business and government belong to those who 
did best on university-admission exams, although everyone admits that such 
tests of memorized facts have little or no relation to on-the-job skills. But a 
system implying that people with more brains and more schooling are better 
people is a problem for America. It is a direct threat to the essential 
American idea that anyone can make a new start. 
</P>
<P>
Until well into this century, schooling was only loosely connected to social 
mobility and occupational success in the United States. Before World War II, 
less than 10% of the population went to college. The "college boy" was an F. 
Scott Fitzgerald character, and admission to an elite school was largely a sign 
of having been born in the upper class, rather than a means of getting there. 
While diplomacy and belles-lettres were reserved for the college-educated 
class, many of America's most lucrative jobs were not. Before World War I, not 
a single U.S. state required its lawyers to have attended law school; they 
learned as apprentices. Until the turn of the century, medicine worked more or 
less on open-market principles: There were many gradations, from quack to nurse 
to fully qualified MD, and a patient was free to choose from among them at his 
or her own risk. Until the early 1960s, candidates for managerial jobs did not 
have to prove that they'd been to college or business school. 
</P>
<P>
With the great spread of education after World War II, the connection between 
schooling and success has become more intimate and intense. In many cases, 
school offers a way to get ahead for people who would otherwise be kept behind: 
This is the classic immigrant dream. But it also has built a new rigidity into 
American life, because people who did not make the correct move at age 20 have 
more trouble shifting jobs at age 40 than they would have in an earlier 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Americans' traditional, down-to-earth skepticism about pointy heads and 
ivory tower experts, there are indications that people at all levels of society 
take their IQ scores and their schooling as valid judgments of their ability. 
The officials who create and administer IQ tests no longer say what the 
pioneers of "mental measurement" did at the turn of the century: that what they 
are quantifying is innate, immutable, unaffected by such factors as family 
income and childhood advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the College Board and the Educational Testing Service 
carefully point out that the tests are intended for one purpose only: to 
predict who will get good grades in college, so that colleges can make informed 
decisions about whom to admit. That is, in fact, what the tests do. But few 
people who take or design the tests seem to believe it deep inside. ETS 
officials themselves, at least those I've interviewed, are not eager to reveal 
their SAT scores. 
</P>
<P>
"IQ is enormously influential in formation of self-image," Howard Gardner, of 
Harvard's psychology department, said in 1987. "It seems that as many people 
remember their Scholastic Aptitude Test scores as remember their Social 
Security numbers." 
</P>
<P>
IQ and SAT scores have become destiny for many Americans, as biology was once 
thought to be destiny for women. The result, a meritocracy based on educational 
degrees and test-score intelligence, sounds as if it is the epitome of American 
fairness, but it can turn out to be as stifling as a highly stratified class 
system has been for England. In Somerset Maugham's novel "Of Human Bondage" the 
protagonist is an orphan, Philip Carey, who wishes he had been born into the 
upper class. His resentment increases when he ends up at a school with his 
social betters. One of them takes him aside for a little chat on career 
choices. If Carey had been born an aristocrat, the friend says, only certain 
callings would suit him -- the church, the army, banking, the bar. But since he 
didn't have a family name to protect, Carey was free to do what he wanted -- 
even, in theory, to go into trade. Clearly the friend wished no such 
humiliating freedom for himself. 
</P>
<P>
Outsiders can instantly see how such prejudices weakened England. There is 
nothing necessarily wrong with the handful of professions considered acceptable 
to the upper class. A country needs competent clergymen, soldiers, financiers 
and lawyers. But the whole idea of "gentlemen's work" pushed much of England's 
best-trained talent into a tiny funnel, diverting it from science and, most of 
all, from manufacturing. England would be healthier today if its most fortunate 
people felt they had more choices in life. 
</P>
<P>
Now, certain occupations, mainly the legal and medical professions, have come 
to be the American version of "gentlemen's work." For smart young people with 
high SAT scores and the right college degrees, law and medicine offer the most 
secure and predictable financial returns and the most prestige. As with 
"gentlemen's work" in England, there's nothing inherently wrong with these 
professions. But as was the case in England, this sort of snobbery narrows 
choice and ultimately weakens the country. It steers well-trained people away 
from some of the most creative and useful jobs; it undermines the American 
belief that anyone can do anything. 
</P>
<P>
Like inherited money or family position, intellectual merit should always be 
liberating. But like money and family, often it is not. All of these forms of 
inherited advantage should make it easier for people to start over, to recover 
from early mistakes, to define roles for themselves. But in practice, each can 
be constricting. The rewards of advanced education and intellectual ability can 
be great -- if you stay on a certain path. When I was living in England, I saw 
a catty story in a London paper about Johnny Carson. He was annoyed to find 
that when he walked down the street in London, nobody noticed him. Since the 
"Tonight" show was not shown in England in those days, Carson, who was lionized 
at home, in London became merely another American tourist. There's a similar 
phenomenon with intellectual merit. In certain quarters, it entitles people not 
simply to respect but also to a good living. But outside those quarters -- 
anywhere except America, to use the Carson metaphor -- the financial reward 
dramatically falls off. In business, teaching, politics, publishing, the arts 
and most forms of science, a good educational pedigree cannot be predictably 
converted into high earnings. In law, medicine and a few other licensed 
professions, it can: Getting into one of the professions puts you on a 
particular plateau. Professionals don't become the richest people in America, 
but they have a more risk-free place near the top than almost anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the "best," most talented people in America are offered a bargain 
attractive to themselves and distorting for the country. It's a temptation 
rational people find hard to resist. In theory, Rhodes scholars, like prewar 
English aristocrats, should have limitless freedom of occupational choice. But, 
in practice, at least one-third of them use that freedom to become lawyers. (In 
the 1940s, it was only one-eighth.) Similarly, Phi Beta Kappa members should 
have wide opportunities in a society that emphasizes academic preparation. Of 
Phi Beta Kappa members who graduated from college in the late 1940s, 5% became 
lawyers or judges. Of those who graduated in the late 1970s, 20% did. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing wrong with people becoming lawyers or doctors. It could also 
be argued that, since so many well-trained people are shunted away from the 
hard sciences, teaching, manufacturing and so forth, there's more room in these 
fields for ambitious newcomers, immigrants and members of the "untalented" 
class. Still, no one contends that, in the abstract, America should be sending 
so many of its best-educated young people into such a narrow range of 
professional jobs. From the country's point of view, the incentives are 
perverse -- as they were for England, when the best trained people were 
diverted from careers in business or technology. The rewards offered for 
education and ability are greatest and most reliable in the narrowest, most 
conventional range of jobs. Societies work best when individual and collective 
interests overlap. The temptations of an aristocracy based on intellectual 
merit make them diverge. 
</P>
<P>
American society is healthier and more successful when our culture suppresses 
the instinct to set ourselves apart from one another. A sense of fairness and 
possibility is America's counterpart to the Asians' sense of order and 
discipline. It's the cultural value that has made American society work. It -- 
more than beaches or freeways or film studios -- is what makes California 
different from all the rest of the Pacific Rim. California's and America's 
brightest moments have occurred when people did not know their place and were 
free to invent new lives for themselves. America would be as lost without its 
sense of possibility as Japan would be without its sense of order and ethnic 
unity. That is why a shift in America's status system, toward less flexibility 
and more rigid separations, toward a meritocracy built on academic pedigrees, 
is so dangerous. If California or the United States were to end up as Japan's 
new Manchuria, this artificial stratification would be an important reason why.

IT HAPPENED TO Ola Bullock, a 44-year-old data reviewer at the Watts branch of 
the Social Security Administration. It happened to Silvia Perez, a 39-year-old 
service representative for Pacific Bell in Orange. It happened to a contracts 
administrator for a Los Angeles-area entertainment company, an airline 
reservations clerk from the San Fernando Valley, a discount stockbroker in San 
Francisco. It has crept up on secretaries, screenwriters, accounting clerks, 
broadcast graphics engineers. And it sneaked up on me -- a 32-year-old reporter 
for the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
At first, each of us occasionally felt minor aches so subtle that we barely 
realized we hurt. Over time, we developed an invisible affliction that made the 
simplest hand movement a major effort filled with pain. It hurt to wash, to 
eat, to open doors, to pick up a baby. It meant losing independence, and it 
threatened our jobs. Bullock couldn't fill out her income tax forms. I could 
barely brush my teeth. "When I tried to apply pressure," Perez says, "it was 
like putting your hand on a nail. I mean it hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Researchers call it the industrial injury of the Information Age. Doctors call 
it cumulative trauma disorder or overuse syndrome or repetitive strain injury. 
I call it computeritis. 
</P>
<P>
IN THE PAST decade, computers have become as common in the office as 
telephones. They do it all: researching, filing, calculating, editing, mailing. 
Along with efficiency and speed and ease, though, the high-tech revolution also 
has generated complaints of crippling side effects. Questions have been raised 
about problems such as blurred vision and an increased risk of miscarriage or 
birth defects. Most clearly linked to computer work, however, is damage to 
tendons, muscles and nerves, apparently caused by punching keys as often as 
18,000 times an hour, for hours at a time. 
</P>
<P>
Cumulative trauma disorder is not a new phenomenon, but until recently it 
appeared to be confined to manufacturing work. It has shown up in meatpacking 
plants, textile mills, auto assembly lines -- anyplace where hand and arm 
motions are repeated continuously. Over the past 10 years, as automation has 
reduced jobs to simpler tasks and the race to increase productivity has cut 
into rest periods, these problems are affecting more and more workers. 
</P>
<P>
Last October, the U.S. Labor Department levied a fine of $4.3 million, the 
largest in its 17-year history, against John Morrell &amp; Co. for "willfully 
ignoring" cumulative trauma disorder that struck more than 40% of the 2,000 
employees in a South Dakota meatpacking plant. In December, a $1.4 million fine 
was proposed for cumulative trauma disorder at a Pepperidge Farms Inc. cookie 
factory in Pennsylvania. Both companies are currently negotiating settlements 
with the Labor Department. 
</P>
<P>
Some employers question the connection of cumulative trauma disorder to 
computer work. In workers' compensation cases, they have argued that the 
problems may result from aging or hobbies, such as knitting, sewing or playing 
musical instruments. And two social scientists from Carnegie Mellon University 
argued in the December issue of American Psychologist that the injuries are 
being used by some Australian clerical workers as an excuse to get disability 
pensions and escape their boring jobs. 
</P>
<P>
But the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, a research arm 
of the Department of Health and Human Services that advises the Labor 
Department, is convinced that repetitive strain injuries have a 
cause-and-effect relationship to computer work. "It's not unique to computers," 
says Vern Anderson, a NIOSH ergonomist (an expert in adapting workplaces for 
workers), "but we are seeing more cases of it because the proportion of the 
work force using computers is increasing." 
</P>
<P>
Currently, 20 million people in the United States use computers daily to make a 
living, according to the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Assn. By 
the year 2000, the association predicts, 75% of all jobs will involve 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Fraser studied cumulative trauma disorder as an ergonomist for the 
California health department. "It's valid to assume," she says, "that millions 
of Americans have computer-related (cumulative trauma) disorder now." 
</P>
<P>
MY FIRST BOUT with computeritis began in late 1986. Very early one December 
morning, I opened my eyes to the predawn gray and wondered why I was awake. I 
moved slightly. Then all I saw was a haze brought on by sudden agony. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, after I took a painkiller prescribed by a doctor, my neck was 
much better. While typing a story later, however, my hands went numb. My 
fingers tingled as if they were being pricked by pins and needles. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor thought that I had a pinched nerve in my neck, caused by cradling a 
phone on my shoulder while I took notes on my computer. The pinched nerve ran 
down my arm, said a chiropractor I started seeing. The hands would heal, he 
predicted, as pressure eased off the nerve. I exchanged my telephone receiver 
for a telephone headset and waited for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, everything got worse. My forearms felt heavy and sore. Nothing eased 
the pain. My chiropractor, Bradley Frederick, theorized that the pinched nerve 
was not my only problem. He had seen something like this a few times before, in 
people who worked with computers. 
</P>
<P>
I had heard vague tales about others at The Times stricken by something called 
"computer disease." When I casually mentioned to a Times computer-systems 
expert that I seemed to have a touch of it, he stared at me, hard. You better 
take it seriously, he snapped. It can ruin you. He gave me the name of a 
reporter who had been forced to take a non-reporting job for nine months 
because of the pain. 
</P>
<P>
Nine months! I called. The man was reporting again, but he still hurt. Stop 
typing now, he ordered me. Otherwise, it gets much worse. 
</P>
<P>
As we talked, I sat facing the glowing green letters of a half-finished story 
on my computer screen. I hung up and kept staring, wondering if I had drifted 
into a cheap horror flick: The Revenge of the Office Machines. 
</P>
<P>
I knew there was always a chance of getting hurt on the job, but the risks of 
journalism had seemed kind of glamorous. I had wandered into the middle of a 
heroin bust in a Baltimore ghetto, driven through a Florida hurricane and 
investigated a thug who relayed threats to me. The newsroom, removed from the 
rush and rumble of the real world, was not supposed to pose any danger. 
</P>
<P>
I refocused on the screen. I wanted to change a sentence, but I didn't dare 
touch the keys. 
</P>
<P>
WHEN you work on a computer, shoulder muscles are tight, constrained to support 
the arms. Eye muscles remain rigidly focused on the screen, usually 15 to 20 
inches away. Each time you punch a key, a muscle running from the elbow through 
the forearm contracts. The muscle is attached to tendons that slide back in 
lubricated sheaths through the wrist to lift the fingers. The muscle relaxes, 
the tendons slide forward, the finger pushes down. 
</P>
<P>
When Ola Bullock enters Social Security information into her computer, she 
doesn't have to pause as she would with a typewriter. She doesn't have to roll 
out a finished form or insert a new one. Contract, slide, relax. Silvia Perez 
types phone orders into a computer almost continuously. Contract, slide, relax. 
I can move paragraphs at will, so I rewrite endlessly. To chat with colleagues, 
I tap out a message and dispatch it electronically. Contract, slide, relax. 
Contract, slide, relax. 
</P>
<P>
Cumulative trauma disorder encompasses problems ranging from swollen tendons 
and muscle spasms to severe nerve damage, or any combination thereof. It 
usually starts when excessive friction scars tissues that then stick to 
tendons, muscle or bone. The tendon sheaths tighten, changing the lubrication 
inside from the normal egg-white consistency to a gluey texture. Body parts go 
from slipping easily to a constant tug-and-pull. 
</P>
<P>
In response, the tendon sheaths may become inflamed, a condition known as 
tenosynovitis. Or the tendons themselves may swell, an injury called 
tendinitis. My doctor said I had both. 
</P>
<P>
Swollen tendons can push into the wrist, compressing the median nerve, which 
runs through a passage in the wrist -- the carpal tunnel -- to the fingers. The 
disorder can also surface along the ulnar nerve running from the elbow to the 
little finger. 
</P>
<P>
Carpal tunnel syndrome is a potentially crippling injury that may require 
surgery to widen the tunnel and relieve pressure on the nerve. That's what 
happened to Perez. Her hands deteriorated for a year, from cramps to numbness 
to shoulder pain. Finally, she lost her grip. Perez had an operation performed 
on her right wrist. Within six weeks, before she could return to work, her 
doctor ordered similar surgery on the left wrist. 
</P>
<P>
"You can also get muscle-pain-spasm syndrome," says Linda H. Morse, chief of 
occupational medicine at Valley Health Center in the Silicon Valley. "That term 
covers about 20 different situations. . . . Usually we see it in the muscles of 
the neck and upper back and sometimes in the shoulder." Bullock is a case in 
point. Her pain appeared in her neck, shoulder and shoulder blades. Such spasms 
can become permanent if allowed to progress. 
</P>
<P>
Computeritis researchers are not certain why some people have some symptoms and 
others have different ones. Nor are they sure why some people manage to hold up 
under the strain with no problems at all. But they suspect that the most likely 
victims are those whose efficiency of movement is hampered by conditions 
ranging from my pinched nerve to someone else's lower back trouble or old 
shoulder injury. Prolonged computer work, Morse says, is so harsh that there is 
little tolerance for imperfections. The pain, she says, tends to show up where 
the imperfections are. 
</P>
<P>
The most common factor is bad posture -- not only of the neck and spine, but 
also of the arms and hands. Bad posture can create the last bit of extra 
pressure, that marginal defect, that leaves computer users vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
Design of furniture and of the computer itself can affect posture. If keyboards 
are too high or too thick, or if chairs are too low, operators may be forced to 
work with hands bent upward. Try it and feel the tendons behind the wrist 
bunching together; it makes that slide movement tough. 
</P>
<P>
Screens can also be too high, or too low, or too far away, prompting operators 
to crane their necks for hours. The keys can be so stiff that it takes a mighty 
effort to push them. 
</P>
<P>
Computer users may not even realize when their bodies are compromised. "It's 
amazing how much difference an inch or two can make," says Mark S. Sanders, an 
ergonomics consultant on the faculty at California State University, 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
THE FIRST STEP in my treatment was to change the way I worked. The Times' 
safety director suggested a new chair and a wrist rest -- a black leather pad 
that sits in front of the keyboard to assure that wrists stay in a level 
position. He raised my screen so that I could keep my neck straight instead of 
stretching to peer down at it. 
</P>
<P>
With the acquiescence of my editor, I cut back on how often I wrote. At the 
International Sports Medicine Institute in West Los Angeles, Bradley Frederick 
worked on the pinched nerve in my neck. In the institute's clinic, I received 
ultrasound and electronic stimulation to ease the inflammation in my forearms 
and wrists. 
</P>
<P>
By June, 1987, I was feeling much better and turning out more copy. Then, on 
Oct. 1 that year, the Whittier earthquake struck. I had one hour to report and 
write a story for a special edition of the paper. My fingers skittered across 
my computer keyboard; I was pumped up, concentrating, composing as fast as I 
could. 
</P>
<P>
I noticed a tiny circle of pain lodged under my right shoulder. The deadline 
passed; another loomed. As I pounded at the keys, the pinpoint of pain started 
glowing hot. 
</P>
<P>
That night, the fire in my shoulder wouldn't let me sleep. Within two weeks, 
the pain spread to my neck. I could barely lift my head. Frequent 
lightning-bolt sensations struck my elbows. The pads on my palms swelled to 
twice their normal size. My wrists felt as if barbed wire were strung inside. 
</P>
<P>
This was worse than the first time. Driving, writing longhand and typing shot 
sparks up and down my arm. Once again, I reduced my workload. I started seeing 
Frederick three times a week. Reluctantly, he recommended that I wear a wrist 
splint. Although it would offer support, prolonged use might also lead to 
muscle atrophy. Even these efforts failed to halt my slide. 
</P>
<P>
A month later, I consulted an orthopedic surgeon, Robert W. Chandler, at the 
Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic in Inglewood. I had heard about him from other 
Times computeritis victims. He recommended physical therapy. 
</P>
<P>
"You were fairly debilitated," recalls Betsy Fleisher Terry, the physical 
therapist I started visiting at Schlink, Nadel &amp; Associates in West Los 
Angeles. Strength, she told me, is rated by therapists on a 0-to-5 scale. My 
wrist muscles were "about a 3, in some cases a 3-plus," she says. "You can be 
fairly functional at a 3-plus, but that tends to lead to more problems because 
you're so weak. It sort of becomes a cycle. You overused it, so it hurts, so 
you don't use it, so it becomes weak, so it's easier to overuse it again and 
then it hurts. 
</P>
<P>
"You see this 3-plus in older people," she says, "people in their 80s." I was 
31. 
</P>
<P>
Like Frederick, Terry had treated others with computeritis. All had resumed 
their normal lives within several months, she said. Because I was on my second 
episode, she calculated that my recovery would take at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
Wisely, she kept her estimate to herself. I would have been stunned. I was 
already reeling from the realization that an "episode" could happen again and 
again. 
</P>
<P>
I was by turns stoic and hysterical, determined to fight my way back to health 
and frightened that my life as a reporter -- my identity since high school -- 
must be over. I railed at the fates, and at my husband and my friends. 
</P>
<P>
In the Times cafeteria one day, I chose beef stew for lunch because I didn't 
think it would require any cutting -- cutting hurt too much. The potatoes, 
however, were too big. My companion noticed that I wasn't eating them, and 
sighed. She reached over to slice the chunks into tiny pieces. She was visibly 
pregnant at the time; it made a nice domestic scene. 
</P>
<P>
At home, my husband, Steve, found me standing helplessly in front of the dryer. 
It hurt so much to fold the laundry that I had to stop. 
</P>
<P>
When Steve and I took a vacation, I made up my mind to avoid talking about my 
condition. We both needed to forget about it. 
</P>
<P>
We stayed with friends in New York City. Before 7 the first morning, I crept 
out of the guest bed -- a mattress in the living room -- and reached for a jump 
rope I had packed and a towel I had laid out the night before. I crept through 
the darkened apartment to the special place I had scouted out earlier. I had a 
ritual to perform in solitude. 
</P>
<P>
What I hadn't planned on was our hosts' waking up so early and going out for 
breakfast. The two of them came down the hall, bundled in coats and scarves, 
and found their exit blocked. 
</P>
<P>
There I was, prone on the floor, my head in a noose that I had fashioned from 
the towel. The rope secured the noose to the knob of the front door. 
</P>
<P>
I had hoped to keep my need for daily traction a secret. They thought I was 
trying to hang myself. 
</P>
<P>
EVERY MONDAY, Wednesday and Friday, Ola Bullock stops typing at noon and 
travels to Inglewood for physical therapy. Her supervisor is sympathetic but 
occasionally asks how much longer she's going to need the treatments. "There've 
been budget cutbacks. There's no one else to do my work," Bullock says. 
</P>
<P>
Before Silvia Perez had her surgery, "I was doing maybe 30% of my job," she 
says. "I tried taking calls and writing out orders, but then someone else had 
to type it in," she says. She worried about the added pressure on her 
co-workers: "What I couldn't do, they were doing." 
</P>
<P>
The more people affected at any given office, the more devastating the loss in 
productivity. Over the past four years, more than 200 of The Times' 1,100 
editorial employees have sought medical help for computeritis. Similar symptoms 
have cropped up at newspapers across the country, but not to such a startling 
degree. The evidence is all over the newsroom. One editor keeps ice packs 
within reach. His inflamed tendons etch angry red lines on the top of his right 
hand. Several reporters have gone on disability leave for as long as 10 months. 
Still another stopped reporting altogether, transferring to another position at 
The Times that requires less typing. There are other costs as well. The Times 
has estimated that it will require at least $500,000 in workers' compensation 
funds to treat the existing cases. 
</P>
<P>
Computer disease has cut wide swaths across other workplaces, too. At an 
Oklahoma City office of The Hertz Corp., about 20% of the data processors who 
feed car-rental contract information into computers came down with tendinitis. 
They type all day, except during lunch and two 15-minute breaks. Speed counts. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Hertz bought new computer tables, adjustable seats and wrist rests 
for that department. The jobs remained the same. Brenda Rigby, a company 
spokeswoman, says Hertz will not disclose the cost of the makeover or the 
number of employees affected. She says that the incidence of injury is down 
sharply but that about 10% of the processors are still troubled by pain and 
swelling. 
</P>
<P>
In at least two instances, federal safety inspectors have directed companies to 
redesign jobs and computer equipment. At a phone company in Denver, U.S. West 
Communications, union officials maintain that since 1986, 182 of 461 
directory-assistance operators developed wrist and hand troubles from rapid 
keying to retrieve phone numbers from computer files. The number has been 
reduced to 15 active cases. 
</P>
<P>
The other complaint was leveled against the U.S. Postal Service Bulk Mail 
Center in Pittsburgh. Back and wrist disorders affected six of the 72 clerks 
there who direct packages along a conveyor belt by typing ZIP codes into 
computers, according to Gary Griess, who heads the Pittsburgh office of the 
U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. At one time, employees had 
alternated half an hour of typing with half an hour of another task. In the two 
years after workers began to type continuously, the health problems appeared, 
Griess says. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Postal Service and the Denver phone company challenged the inspectors' 
conclusions, although both eventually negotiated settlements, agreeing to 
provide employee education and, possibly, new equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody knows exactly how many people have computeritis. "There's a need to 
collect better data," says Louis Slesin, editor of the VDT News, a New 
York-based computer newsletter. He believes that the incidence of computeritis 
has been underreported. "If it's a small office, you may never hear about it," 
he says. "If it's not unionized, you may never hear about it." 
</P>
<P>
Some victims may not even know why they hurt. An Indiana journalist remembers 
thinking her wrist hurt because she popped the tops off seven cans of Diet Coke 
a day. She cut back on soda, but it didn't help. A former San Francisco 
discount stockbroker says she thought her sore neck and tingling arms were a 
result of aging. "I was starting to think I was too old to do the job," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
As for Perez, "I had fallen down a couple of times and (doctors) suspected a 
fracture in my right hand." She filed for workers' compensation after an 
orthopedist diagnosed carpal tunnel syndrome and told her it was work-related. 
</P>
<P>
MEASURES HAVE been passed in at least nine states to regulate computer work. In 
California, purchasing guidelines for workstations have been adopted for state 
government, university and community college employees. The state Division of 
Occupational Safety and Health is studying whether to impose computer work 
rules on all workers. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Assemblyman Tom Hayden says he and colleague Tom Bates will 
try this year to get computeritis laws passed statewide. 
</P>
<P>
Such a law was enacted last June in Suffolk County, N.Y. It requires a 
15-minute break for employees every three hours, employee education and 
specifications for new work furniture. 
</P>
<P>
Those solutions sound simple, but they involve fundamental changes in the way 
employees approach their work -- and they can be expensive. Consequently, says 
Laura Stock, of the Labor Occupational Health Program at the University of 
California, Berkeley: "It's a political battle more than a scientific one. It's 
a labor-management struggle. Will companies do what's needed on their own?" 
</P>
<P>
She doesn't think so. "That gap between what we know and agree upon, and what's 
actually in practice in the workplace is still there," Stock says. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Columbia University professor Alan F. Westin believes that 
most offices are trying voluntarily to defuse the potential for harm. Westin 
studied the way 110 companies dealt with computer technology, surveying each 
firm between 1982 and summer, 1985, and between fall, 1985, and 1986. The first 
time, 75% failed to display much interest in the potential health hazards posed 
by computer work. The second time, more than 60% were taking steps to minimize 
the problems, steps "that might not satisfy the critics," Westin says, but that 
included distributing literature about computeritis and education about 
exercises and stretching. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, however, the changes have come too late. Westin tells of a bank 
he surveyed, but chooses not to name, where half a dozen data processors in a 
department of 35 or 40 started blaming their computers and workstations for a 
range of aches and pains. Officials at the bank, "which had a reputation for 
having good employee relations," Westin says, "drew the conclusion that it was 
the attitude or malingering of those six." 
</P>
<P>
Only after 12 of the data processors were disabled did the bank replace its 
rigid furniture with adjustable desks and chairs, spending $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Times, too, is trying to quell its outbreak of computeritis. Newsroom 
employees are now required to watch a videotape demonstrating good workstation 
posture. They are given a brochure that urges them to take frequent breaks and 
describes equipment that can help prevent strain. The paper accommodates 
requests for adjustable chairs, shelves that lower keyboard height and personal 
computers with a lighter touch than the standard issue terminals. The Times is 
also experimenting with new keyboards and adjustable computer tables. 
</P>
<P>
Michael G. Manfro, The Times' safety director, says the pace has been slow 
because "it took a long time before everybody believed this was real." 
</P>
<P>
"They've been kind of inching along," says Sanders, the ergonomist who serves 
as a Times consultant. "It's unfortunate for the people that are in there, 
caught during the process." 
</P>
<P>
FOR MONTHS after the Whittier earthquake, I focused only on the majority of my 
colleagues going about their business -- my business. For the first time in my 
life, I was jealous of my friends when they did good work. I'm being left 
behind, I thought. 
</P>
<P>
I learned ways to conserve my capacity to use my hands. Steve washed dishes and 
did my other chores to leave me energy for work. I taped phone interviews and 
sent the cassettes to be transcribed. 
</P>
<P>
At some point, though, I had to type. I was used to hitting the keys at the 
same speed as the voice in my head that put the words together. Now I had to 
think about stopping periodically to rest; I had to remember to hold my neck 
straight and keep my shoulders from hunching; I had to stay alert for signs of 
fatigue that warned me to knock off for a few hours or even the rest of the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
At my physical therapy sessions, I lay on a treatment table in a hospital gown 
while Betsy Fleisher Terry pressed hard on my shoulder, arms and hands to 
loosen knotted tissue, relax muscles in spasm and firm up spots that she 
described as "boggy." To a healthy person, the rubbing would have felt like 
deep massage. For me, it was torture. I left feeling as if I had been beat up. 
</P>
<P>
A few months later, Terry told me it was time to regain my lost strength. Do 
wrist curls, she said, while you hold a 12-ounce can of tomato paste. Later, 
she suggested moving on to a 1-pound bag of spaghetti. Unfortunately, the next 
step was not garlic, but a 2-pound bag of dried beans. My exercise also 
included squeezing an orange sponge ball or Silly Putty. 
</P>
<P>
Slowly my endurance increased. From typing two or three minutes, then stopping 
for an hour until the pain died down, I got to the point where I could type for 
20 minutes straight. In a few months, I often could type for 45 minutes and 
break for 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
I charted my progress with domestic triumphs, too. I could wash the dishes 
again. 
</P>
<P>
But I seldom felt like an achiever. Instead of listening to my understanding 
husband, parents and friends, I chose to pay attention to the sneers of those 
who thought I must be faking or crazy or a wimp. I stuffed myself with candy 
and cookies, gaining 7 pounds. I drove aimlessly around the city, giving myself 
pep talks. 
</P>
<P>
David Rosenzweig, then The Times' Metro editor, noticed my misery. He took me 
aside. What can you do that would help the paper but would not involve typing? 
he asked. And so I spent seven weeks in April and May speaking Spanish with a 
tutor, courtesy of The Times. I acquired a new reporting tool, and my healing 
sped along. 
</P>
<P>
I dropped down to two therapy sessions a week. I needed traction only a few 
times a month. I abandoned the splint, the despised symbol of my weakened 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Still, I'm a long way from normalcy. 
</P>
<P>
I've been typing for nearly half an hour now. If I don't stop, the puffiness in 
my elbows and forearms will give way to pain. The front of my right shoulder 
seems tender. The base of my right thumb is stiff; my wrist is aching too. If I 
don't stop . . . 
</P>
<P>
THERAPY OFFERS relief for Ola Bullock, but the pain always comes back. "My 
doctor told me not to give up," she says. "I would just hate to just stop 
working completely." 
</P>
<P>
Silvia Perez is back at full speed. Her right hand is much better now, but her 
left is sometimes numb. "Should this recur, what do I do?" she worries. "I'm a 
single mom. I have to have a job. Where do I go now where there's no typing and 
no computers?" 
</P>
<P>
As for me, Chandler says I have every reason to believe that someday I'll be 
working as much as I did before. I'll have to do it differently, that's all. 
I'll continue to exercise, to take frequent short breaks, to make sure my 
workstation doesn't force me into contortions that add to the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"What you are looking at," he says, "is adaptation." 
</P>
<P>
I'll have setbacks, he has told me. But I have to test my limits. 
</P>
<P>
So I didn't panic when the pain intensified after I worked four hours straight 
on a deadline in late May. I simply stopped punching keys for three weeks until 
the soreness faded. 
</P>
<P>
In the middle of writing this story, I managed five six-day workweeks before I 
overdid it again. The result was another flare-up. This time, though, I 
rebounded even faster. 
</P>
<P>
For six days, I rested. And on the seventh day, I typed.

Sitcom mega-producers Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner ("The Cosby Show," "A 
Different World," "Roseanne") are developing a miniseries for NBC that may well 
go down as TV's answer to "Mississippi Burning." 
</P>
<P>
Quietly in the works for two years, "Selma, Lord, Selma" is based on the 1980 
book of the same title by Sheyann Webb and Rachel Nelson, as well as the 
award-winning "Eyes on the Prize" documentary series aired on PBS in 1987, 
which viewed the civil rights struggle primarily through the eyes of black 
participants. Henry Hampton, who produced the PBS series, is co-executive 
producer/consultant; Michael and Alice Arlen wrote the script. 
</P>
<P>
Hampton, who is black, told us that he hopes "Selma" will help debunk what he 
considers false aspects of "Mississippi Burning," which has been criticized for 
relegating blacks to minor roles in its depiction of the civil rights battle. 
</P>
<P>
"I traveled around the country, talking to young people during Black History 
Month," Hampton said, "and I must say, I found their lack of critical response 
to the film very disturbing." 
</P>
<P>
"Selma" will be filmed on location in the title city, where officials have been 
"very cooperative so far," Hampton added. Stacy Jenel Smith

Those protests over "The Last Temptation of Christ" aren't finished yet -- not 
with Martin Scorsese among those nominated for the Best Director Oscar. 
Although conservative Christian leader Donald E. Wildmon won't be demonstrating 
Oscar night, Dr. R. L. Hymers Jr. -- pastor of the Fundamentalist Baptist 
Tabernacle of L.A. -- will. 
</P>
<P>
Hymers told us he plans to lead an anti-Scorsese protest outside the Shrine 
Auditorium on March 29. "If he wins, that would seem to put the seal of 
approval on attacks against Christianity," Hymers said. 
</P>
<P>
Hymers added that he'll be accompanied by members of his congregation, and 
"probably, the man with the cross," referring to the anonymous protester who 
wears Jesus-like garb and drags a massive cross. 
</P>
<P>
Hymers said he'll be "a bit more strident" -- than in previous protests -- for 
his Oscar appearance. "I'll be very careful of what I say. I don't want 
anything misconstrued." (He was accused of making anti-Semitic comments during 
earlier protests, and later apologized.) 
</P>
<P>
Wildmon, exec director of the Tupelo, Miss.-based American Family Assn., told 
us an Oscar protest "would be money unwisely spent" in his view, and considers 
the fundamentalist boycott of "Temptation" already "a huge success." 
</P>
<P>
Scorsese, figured Wildmon, has a fair chance of winning the Oscar: "It would be 
Hollywood's way of getting back at us." Pat H. Broeske

Touchstone Pics has just optioned Gerald L. Posner's grim and ultraviolent 
"Warlords of Crime: Chinese Secret Societies -- The New Mafia." It's the true 
saga of the secret Chinese Triads that dominate the world heroin trade. From 
McGraw-Hill in 1988, it was dubbed by a NY Times reviewer as "powerful, 
frightening and, unfortunately, nonfiction." 
</P>
<P>
The book spans generations and continents, and Posner is curious about how 
Hollywood will adapt it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's episodic," he told us. "There's not a central character who weaves 
throughout. You could almost make a dozen different movies from it." 
</P>
<P>
But, he continued, "(film) audiences have already responded to really wonderful 
movies -- like the 'Godfather' films -- about organized crime. This is even 
more sinister, plus it's exotic." 
</P>
<P>
He said there's an added twist to his mobster material: Because Hong Kong 
reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, the crime syndicates there -- which 
deal in "tens of billions of dollars annually" -- are seeking "new homes" and 
are headed to the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
Touchstone, said a source close to the film, is now looking for a writer "to 
research the book and create a story." Pat H. Broeske

Harrison Ford has nabbed the choice lead in Mirage/Warner Bros' "Presumed 
Innocent," to film in July for director Alan Pakula. The thriller, based on 
Scott Turow's bestseller and adapted by Oscar-winner Frank Pierson, concerns an 
investigator for the district attorney's office who is assigned to look into 
the murder of his former mistress. 
</P>
<P>
Originally optioned by Sydney Pollack and Mark Rosenberg (as producers) for a 
reported $1 million at United Artists, the project was subsequently sold to 
Warners last summer.

Negotiations are under way for Brian Dennehy to play Ford's boss, who -- like 
Ford's character -- figures in the unraveling mystery. Leonard Klady

STEPPING DOWN MEMORY LANE WITH AILEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alvin Ailey spent his adolescence and early adulthood -- from the ages of 12 to 
23 -- in Los Angeles. The choreographer, former dancer and founder of the 
three-decade old Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater remembers his years as 
member of the Lester Horton company -- "Sometimes, I drive by our theater, 
still there, on Melrose Ave. -- it's a male porn house now." He also remembers 
downtown Los Angeles in the late '40s and early '50s as "a really special 
place." 
</P>
<P>
In the elegantly refurbished Olive Street lobby of the Biltmore Hotel, the 
58-year-old Ailey reminisces about places long gone: the Biltmore Theater, 
Philharmonic Auditorium, the Orpheum theater, the nightclubs of Central Avenue. 
He ticks off names of performers he remembers seeing in those years: Martha 
Graham, Tommy Dorsey, Alexandra Danilova, Billie Holiday, Katherine Dunham. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I saw Dunham was right here, in this building in the (long-ago 
razed) Biltmore Theater," Ailey says. 
</P>
<P>
The influence of the pioneer choreographer -- whose heyday was the 1930s and 
'40s -- on generations of dancers and choreographers of all stripes cannot be 
overestimated, Ailey says. 
</P>
<P>
His tribute to her, "The Magic of Katherine Dunham," mounted at a cost of more 
than $500,000, was given its first performance at City Center in Manhattan in 
late 1987. Since then it has been danced, by the Ailey company, in Washington, 
Boston and Paris. 
</P>
<P>
It should also have been part of the latest Ailey engagement in Los Angeles, 
which, under auspices of the UCLA Center for the Arts, takes place Tuesday 
through next Sunday at the Wiltern Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"But it would have taken extra funding -- between $25,000 and $35,000 over the 
cost of the engagement," said Pebbles Wadsworth, director of the center. "Given 
more time to raise those funds, I think we can expect to see the Dunham show 
when the Ailey company returns next," probably 1990-91, she added. 
</P>
<P>
"It broke my heart not to be able to bring the Dunham evening here," Ailey 
said, pointing out that two cities on the company's current January-May tour of 
the United States will get to see that program, which offers 14 pieces from the 
Dunham repertory. Those cities -- St. Louis (near where Dunham now lives) and 
Minneapolis -- are on the eastern leg of the tour. Dunham, 79 this year, and 
some members of her former company helped re-create these works for the 1987 
revival. 
</P>
<P>
Reminiscing about his career beginnings, Ailey talked about going to New York 
with his colleague, Carmen de Lavallade, in 1954 -- after the death of his 
mentor, Lester Horton -- dancing on Broadway, and starting his own company. 
</P>
<P>
"Little did I know, when I started, first with one concert in 1958, then with 
two the following season, that I would be chasing funds for the rest of my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, he says, "I like what I'm doing." 
</P>
<P>
And, though he says European audiences appreciate his work and his company more 
fully than do North American audiences, "When I'm depressed, I think how much 
we have done in these 30 years." From his headquarters in New York, Ailey 
manages the future of two Ailey companies, the touring one and a junior troupe, 
oversees a school where 2,000 students receive dance training, and makes 
dances. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of funding, we can have only one long rehearsal period every year," 
the choreographer said, "So it is not possible for me to be able to create more 
than two new works a year. That's frustrating. And, of course, having a company 
means having a whole lot of problems all the time. This is a stress business."

NEW CLIPS BY ROY ORBISON, THE TRAVELING WILBURYS, HANKS JR. (&amp; SR.) 
ENSHRINE THE DEARLY DEPARTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You're an executive at a record company and you're pleased as punch because one 
of your artists has a hit record about to break in a big way. The next step is 
to make a video for the song. 
</P>
<P>
You've only got one problem: The lead singer is dead . . . and, it goes without 
saying, unable to make your shooting schedule. 
</P>
<P>
So how do you create a clip around a star who has breathed his last "120 
Minutes"? That was the dilemma facing three companies when it came time to 
shoot videos for current singles: Roy Orbison's "You Got It," the Traveling 
Wilburys' "End of the Line" (which features Orbison as one of several lead 
vocalists) and the "duet" between Hank Williams Jr. and his very late daddy in 
"There's a Tear in My Beer." 
</P>
<P>
In all three cases, directors managed to find a creative and satisfying 
solution to the problem of dealing with the dearly departed. 
</P>
<P>
Those three video eulogies are among the clips featured in this month's Sound 
&amp; Vision, where current pop videos are rated on a 0-100 scale. 
</P>
<P>
Clips Picked to Click: 
</P>
<P>
Elvis Costello's "Veronica." (Director: Evan English.) It's not flashy, but it 
just may be one of the best pop videos ever. At its beginning and end, Costello 
is in a nursing home talking about his late grandmother, wondering if rather 
than suffering from senility or forgetfulness, she had "gone to hide" in the 
recesses of her memories. Then it's off for a trip through the decades in that 
very full mind, set to Costello's bouncy but dramatic ditty, as the aged 
Veronica flashes back through an entire lifetime -- girlhood swims, adult 
passions, marriage, the war, tears, arguments, joy. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever the video cuts back to Costello in the nursing home, we actually hear 
him on the sound track quietly singing along to his record. Thus we get the 
benefit of the song's full production and a sense of the gentle sadness 
Costello must have had when writing the tune. Even if "Veronica" didn't stand 
out for interrupting the non-stop juvenilia of MTV with the reality of the 
elderly, its supremely emotional juxtaposition of lyric and image might still 
be enough to send chills down your spine. Bravo. 97 
</P>
<P>
Michael Jackson's "Leave Me Alone." (Director: Kim Blashfield.) Jackson has 
always seemed so out of touch with the world that it's a surprise to see him in 
such a reflexive mode in this surreal video journey. Against the paranoid 
sentiment of the song's lyric, Jackson allows the visuals to take a wittier, 
possibly even self-mocking, turn. Amid the computer-graphics maelstrom are a 
blur of real-life tabloid headlines, including one about his relationship with 
Elizabeth Taylor and another about his reported attempt to buy the bones of the 
Elephant Man. What do we see next but a weirdly disembodied Liz herself, 
followed by a hilarious shot of Michael dancing alongside the skeleton of an 
elephant? To quote one of the many songs that Jackson owns, turn off your mind, 
relax and float downstream. 79 
</P>
<P>
Karel Fialka's "Hey Matthew." (Director: Brad Langford.) The point of view here 
is from the inside of a TV set, from which we view the concerned face of father 
Fialka and the blank, impressionable one of his young son Matthew as they 
switch channels. By clip's end, it's easy to identify with Fialka's parental 
worries: What chance do the professions of doctor, lawyer, policeman or fireman 
have in young Matthew's mind, pitted against the glorified images of Rambo and 
the A-Team? 78 
</P>
<P>
Worth a Look and a Listen: 
</P>
<P>
Hank Williams Jr.'s "There's a Tear in My Beer." (Director: Ethan Russell.) One 
dark and stormy night, Hank Jr. is recording one of his legendary pop's 
unreleased compositions when lightning strikes the studio. Suddenly, a 
silhouette is seen on the glass of the door and the voice of Hank Sr. joins his 
son's. The junior Williams opens the door, and there's his long-dead daddy, 
complete with his '50s band, in glorious black and white. Hank Jr. steps in and 
father and son happily duet to the finish. 
</P>
<P>
Since this recently discovered song was recorded only as a demo by Hank Sr., 
you might well wonder where they got this sterling footage of the long-gone 
crooner singing the tune with a band. Simple (almost): Director Russell dug up 
kinescope footage of Williams singing another song on TV and superimposed 
someone else's lips singing "Tear in My Beer." Then came the superimposition of 
Hank Jr. as well. This video is creepy in more ways than one -- not the least 
of which might be its bizarre, ultimate wish-fulfillment for the obsessive Hank 
Jr. 69 
</P>
<P>
The Traveling Wilburys' "End of the Line." (Director: Willy Smax.) Roy Orbison, 
who died in December, is but one of the lead singers of this life-affirming 
ditty, along with George Harrison, Jeff Lynne and Tom Petty. When the Lonely 
One's verse comes along, the director cuts to a shot of a chair with Orbison's 
guitar, rocking all by itself. Simple, but as effective as possible given the 
circumstances. 67 
</P>
<P>
Roy Orbison's "You Got It." (Director: Leslie Libman.) Orbison had sung this 
current hit during a European TV appearance filmed before a live audience. 
Rather than use a straightforward rendering of that film, the director chose to 
capitalize on Orbison's mysterious, almost ghostly image by projecting the 
footage onto billowing curtains. 65 
</P>
<P>
Gamma Ray Rot: 
</P>
<P>
U2's "Angel of Harlem." (Director: Richard Lowenstein.) If U2 is the band of 
the '80s, then why hasn't the group made a single good video? This disastrous 
visual mishmash, which accompanies a terrific single, is no exception. On the 
one hand, it's a souvenir travelogue capturing the Irish quartet attending the 
many premieres of its recent film, "Rattle and Hum," replete with flashbulbs 
and adoring fans. On the other hand, it's a tribute to the song's subject, the 
late Billie Holiday, replete with shots of poor black folks. Is U2 trying to 
ironically contrast its incredible success with Holiday's tragic fate, or do 
the four lads just like shots of themselves getting out of limousines? Either 
way, this is truly asinine. 30 
</P>
<P>
House of Lords' "I Wanna Be Loved." (Director: Jim Shay.) "I just wanna be 
loved by a girl like you," sings hairy frontman James Christian, even though 
the abundance of scantily-clad members of the shapelier sex ought to force a 
plural reading of girl. Among the countless lasses by whom our hero wants to be 
loved are a blonde and brunette glimpsed during a kinky party scene sharing a 
riding crop -- an instrument that would be put to much better use by these 
silly soft-metal boys' mamas on their sonnys' behinds. 0 
</P>
<P>
Sheena Easton's "The Lover in Me." (Director: Dominic Sena.) Ever since Prince 
got hold of her, Sheena has been suffering from an acute bout of Olivia 
Newton-John Syndrome -- that tragic disease that causes harmless easy-listening 
queens to turn into disco divas who wield sex as a weapon. But Olivia never 
sank this low. In this clip, Sheena is once again the lady in red, on stage in 
a nightclub where other barely dressed young ladies lie on the bar and allow 
male patrons to splash buckets of water over their nubile bodies, 
"Flashdance"-style. (Places like that are just a dime a dozen in L.A., aren't 
they?) On stage, Easton pruriently pouts, teases and entices until, finally, 
one understandably red-blooded fellow rushes the stage -- only to be carted off 
by bouncers as Sheena looks shocked. You can look -- look a lot, please, 
insists Sheena -- but you better not touch, or even come within nine yards. 
What a role model this gal is. 0

POP EYE: ARE PEPSI, MADONNA ON THE ROCKS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Surely Pepsi knew Madonna wasn't a virgin. 
</P>
<P>
The provocative religious symbolism of the pop starlet's "Like a Prayer" video 
led to a storm of media attention after a small Catholic group protested its 
showing on Italian TV. But PepsiCo is standing by its $5 million pitchwoman. 
</P>
<P>
According to a Pepsi spokesman, the firm is editing the two-minute ad (which 
initially ran Grammy night) into 30-and 60-second spots, which will air "when 
the single is hot and everyone is humming the tune." 
</P>
<P>
But Pepsi refused to address a long-standing topic of industry debate: Would a 
corporate sponsor scrub a mega-buck endorsement deal simply because a pop 
artist's work -- be it song lyrics or video images -- provokes a furor? Or 
inflames religious fundamentalists? Or insults an ethnic minority? 
</P>
<P>
In other words, should pop stars accept millions if they're obligated to make 
their art fit corporate-imposed morality or fashion? Madonna's manager, Freddy 
DeMann, refused to comment on Pepsi's agreement -- and any "freedom of artistic 
expression" clauses it might contain. 
</P>
<P>
But industry sources say other Pepsi superstar endorsement deals gave the firm 
sweeping latitude to torpedo a deal as a result of public furor over an 
artist's work or private indiscretions. 
</P>
<P>
According to a contract Pepsi signed with Def Leppard for a Canadian tour 
sponsorship deal last year: "The sponsor shall have the right to terminate the 
agreement in the event that any members of (the band) are involved in any 
publicity deemed to be sufficiently unfavorable in the opinion of the sponsor 
as to degrade the sponsor's image or destroy or lessen the value of the 
artist's name for the purposes contemplated by this agreement." 
</P>
<P>
The message is clear: If Pepsi feels a band has somehow given its corporate 
patron a black eye, the sponsor can choose to bail out. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the kind of potential horror story that points out the dangers you can 
have with these kind of corporate deals," said Geffen Records A&amp;R exec John 
Kalodner. "Personally I've always been against my bands being involved in any 
endorsement deals. The art and the music should come first -- free from any 
neccessity of pleasing a corporation." 
</P>
<P>
Def Leppard manager Cliff Burnstein insists the band's brief association with 
Pepsi was trouble-free. "The key question in all this should be -- how badly do 
you need the money?" he said. "For us it was a tiny Canadian deal that we did, 
in part, just to see how we could handle the notion of being involved with a 
corporation. Frankly, if you're worried about the money, then don't take it. 
Because if you agree to play ball with them, then you have to play their game 
-- or be able to walk away from it." 
</P>
<P>
Other top managers also expressed concern that pop stars' growing involvement 
with corporate dealmakers opens the door for a potential censorship skirmish. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get art involved with commerce, it becomes very difficult to decide 
where you draw the line," said Martin Kirkup, who manages Brian Ferry, Joe 
Jackson and OMD. "I can't imagine Freddy would ever allow Pepsi to control what 
Madonna does. But if you were to ever give up any control over your artist's 
work -- no matter how many barrel-loads of cash you might get -- you'd be doing 
a real disservice them." 
</P>
<P>
Where does this leave Madonna? Some industry insiders see the whole Pepsi 
juggernaut -- controversy or not -- as a shrewdly conceived media hype. "I'm 
sure Madonna could use the $5 million, but the Pepsi deal gave her the 
opportunity to make an event out of her new song," explained A&amp;M Records 
vice president of publicity Wayne Isaak. "Call it amazing or call it weird, but 
when you're an artist at Madonna's level, trying to get to that next career 
plateau, you almost need something extraordinary like a huge corporate 
endorsement to get that big media splash. 
</P>
<P>
"At A&amp;M we don't do things like give Pepsi a song before you give it to 
radio or TV. But by letting Pepsi debut the song, it did make the song an 
event. And in a society so full of information overload, it's one of the few 
ways left to guarantee that your event will stand out from all the other events 
that week."

BELIEVE IT OR DON'T: Whenever Harry Dean Stanton performs, he draws a crowd. 
And his Club Lingerie show last weekend was no exception, drawing such celebs 
as Jack Nicholson (wearing his shades and touting the Lakers), Sam Shepard and 
Penny Marshall. . . . Who's the last person you'd want flying the friendly 
skies of your neighborhood? (Make that the last person after Axl Rose.) Our 
vote goes to Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry, who has been prodding vocalist 
Steven Tyler into writing more songs for the group's next album by buzzing his 
Massachusetts home in the morning at the helm of his private plane, the 
"Warrior." "It's my idea of a wake-up call," insists Perry, who said the band 
travels to Vancouver, Canada, in April to begin work on a new album. . . . If 
you like Israeli pop, of which Ofra Haza is the latest hip practitioner, then 
perhaps you would want to sample the charms of Egyptian pop, which will waft 
across the KCRW-FM airwaves Wednesday at 10 a.m. on Tom Schnabel's "Morning 
Becomes Eclectic." Special guest Samir Hachim (an entertainment writer) will 
offer "New Sounds from the Middle East," with new songs from such Egyptian 
popsters Ali Hmida, Mohammad Munir and Ali Hajjar.

BRAT PACK IN MOSCOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So the Hollywood "brat pack" has taken it upon itself to show Americans that 
the Soviet "people aren't ogres but 'just like us' " ("The Brat Pack's Moscow 
Mission," by Ronald Brownstein, Jan. 22). This truth has provided the moral 
foundation for the policies of the Cold War. For if Russians and other subjects 
of the Soviet empire are just as human as we are, how can any decent human 
being tolerate a government that denies him the right to select his leaders, to 
express ideas freely, to hear diverse points of view, to practice religion and 
to emigrate? How many Soviet apologists in this country would stand for the 
denial of these basic human rights by their own government? It is the "peace" 
activists who, by trivializing the importance of freedom, have demonstrated an 
appalling lack of sympathy for the Soviet people. While most of the "brat 
packers" appear to have had their eyes opened by their Moscow trip, others have 
yet to shed their moral blinders and remain content to resign others to a fate 
that they would never accept for themselves.

BRAT PACK IN MOSCOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How sad that members of the "brat pack" were so disillusioned by their trip. 
Our recent collaboration between top American songwriters and Soviet tunesmiths 
-- the U.S./U.S.S.R. Songwriters Summit in November, 1988 -- revealed the best 
of a new society struggling to be better. We missed our gourmet restaurants, 
limos and satin sheets, too. But perhaps our group (Cyndi Lauper, Michael 
Bolton, Brenda Russell, Barry Mann and 50 others, including film crew) were 
more philosophical by virtue of maturity. 
</P>
<P>
Where the "brat pack" saw food shortages, we noticed a country where everyone 
is fed. Where other visitors may have seen small and unglamorous housing, we 
were in awe of a place where everyone is sheltered. There are no people 
sleeping in cardboard boxes on the streets of Moscow. And, most dear to our 
hearts, artists, composers, writers and athletes are all treated as useful 
citizens and given training, support and respect. 
</P>
<P>
America has come to its success through a different route. Although a lack of 
monetary rewards for extra effort may demotivate the Soviets, we know from 
having negotiated with them under their new system that ambition is not 
something they lack. 
</P>
<P>
Please understand -- we saw the repression, alcoholism, shortages, 
disorganization, corruption and boredom with which Soviet life is plagued. But 
we chose to view these problems as we do American problems -- as those that can 
be solved.

BRAT PACK IN MOSCOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was clear that the political orientations that the "brat pack" held were 
altered by just a couple of weeks in the U.S.S.R. Such shallowness reinforces 
the flighty, uncommitted image of affluent child actors. It is unfortunate that 
their influence will always outweigh their merit. But since they enjoy kissing 
airport Tarmac, I suggest they spend a couple of weeks in Rangoon, Jakarta or 
Calcutta (to see how most of the world lives) and then fly to Moscow. I am sure 
they will find socialist Tarmac a similar flavor to our American variety.

MODERN MATURITY;

THE DINING IS CIVILIZED -- AND SO ARE THE PRICES -- AT VICTOR HUGO'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Victor Hugo's, 235 N. Beverly Drive, Beverly Hills. (213) 858-7292. Open for 
lunch Monday-Friday, for dinner Monday-Saturday. Full bar. Valet parking. All 
major credit cards accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $50-$80. 
</P>
<P>
When was the last time you went to a really grown-up restaurant? It's probably 
been so long that you hardly remember what it was like. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles restaurants have been going through a phase of adolescent 
rebellion, and most of us have become so accustomed to their tantrums that 
we've come to accept them as the norm. 
</P>
<P>
But there really was a time when you could make a reservation at a restaurant 
and know that a table would be waiting when you walked in the door. You could 
sit down at that table with the reasonable expectation that your seat would be 
comfortable enough to harbor you for a few hours without demanding the services 
of a chiropractor the next day. You could even talk all evening, hear what was 
being said, and not wake up hoarse the next morning. Best of all, when the 
waiter came to take your order, that is all he would do. There would be no 
jokes, no small talk, no introductions. 
</P>
<P>
We still have a few restaurants like that, of course. Unfortunately, most of 
them are very old (and stodgy), very expensive (and formal), or both. And that 
is why the opening of Victor Hugo's, a very grown-up restaurant that is very 
new and not outrageously expensive, is such a pleasant surprise. 
</P>
<P>
What further distinguishes Victor Hugo's from the other grown-up restaurants in 
town is the sleek modern look of the room. This is a stunning place -- pale, 
cool and up to date with artistic accents everywhere you look. The major work 
of art is the exhibition kitchen, dramatically framed so that it is the focus 
of the room. But unlike most open kitchens, this one is glassed in so that you 
can watch the chefs perform without listening to the whir of fans, the buzz of 
mixers and the clank of pots. 
</P>
<P>
But despite its trendy touches, this room manages to be both elegant and 
extremely comfortable. The upholstered chairs are gorgeous and very cozy, the 
booths along the walls make intimacy easy, and no matter where you are sitting, 
noise is never a problem. It's a very civilized room. 
</P>
<P>
And the service lives up to the ambiance. It's so professional that you hardly 
even notice it. 
</P>
<P>
All this is what took us out to eat in the days before we all started going to 
restaurants just to see what new sort of morsel would appear on our plates. For 
although the adolescent restaurants may not be reliable, comfortable or cozy, 
many of them make up for it with fabulously enticing food. And while some of 
the food at Victor Hugo's is very good, much of the time you find yourself 
wishing that the kitchen had a little of that adolescent energy. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of the specials, most of the food is not very high on the 
excitement quotient. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly the kitchen is capable of more. The specials have been spectacular: One 
day there was a heap of mussels topped with a julienne of vegetables in a rich, 
buttery saffron sauce of incredible intensity. Lying across the top was a 
whimsical banner of pasta -- a thin sheet in ribbons of color. The dish was 
fabulous. 
</P>
<P>
Another night the special appetizer was taramasalata, the Greek speciality made 
of fish roe whipped into a creamy paste. Chef Yves Buso (who once worked at the 
Regency Club) elevated this simple dish into a tour de force: The taramasalata 
itself was wrapped up in smoked salmon, appearing on the plate as a bright 
orange disk. Surrounding it was a creamy cucumber sauce shot through with 
ribbons of green chile puree. The green pattern added both visual appeal and a 
small jolt of flavor. The dollop of caviar on top of the salmon did much the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
But few of the dishes on the menu are this inviting. Appetizers include a range 
of choices from the seafood bar prominently displayed in the kitchen; the 
shrimp, clams, oysters, etc. are all fresh and fine, but you hardly need a 
great chef to prepare them. The salmon tartar, on the other hand, was a bit 
bland. It needed more ginger -- or maybe some lemon, anything, to give it 
pizazz. 
</P>
<P>
There are some nice salads, but with one exception, none are remarkable. The 
spinach salad, however, is a new take on an old theme: the spinach is finely 
shredded, mixed with bacon and then topped with a perfectly poached egg and a 
dab of vinaigrette that has some corn whipped into the blend. The dish is also 
on the luncheon menu, and it makes a perfect light lunch. 
</P>
<P>
The pasta dishes (carefully listed as "appetizer pastas" lest you be tempted to 
order them as main courses) did not impress me. Rigatoni with tomato, basil, 
jalapeno and pepperoni somehow managed to be bland. And the creamy risotto with 
fresh porcini mushrooms was odd -- the rice, cooked until it had started to 
fall apart, was served in a circle around a stew of rather rubbery mushrooms 
cooked in red wine. 
</P>
<P>
Entrees aren't always successful either. Steamed striped bass served on a bed 
of oyster mushrooms was mostly bland -- and the rather tough little 
broccoli-filled ravioli that came with it weren't much help. I thought the 
venison was not very happily paired with a sweet raspberry vinegar sauce 
(although I did like the accompanying celery root puree, cunningly wrapped up 
in a leaf). And the "scaloppini" of chicken -- a breast that had been pounded 
flat and filled with a layer of olive paste -- was served in a creamy sauce 
that totally masked the flavor of the chicken. A very bitter garlic mousse 
didn't help. As for the beef tenderloin, the large serving of very tender meat 
was absolutely overwhelmed by a bordelaise sauce tasting strongly of bacon. And 
the potato ravioli that came with it were no more successful than the broccoli 
ravioli served with the striped bass. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, this menu plays it safe. There really is something for 
everybody. People who like plain food will find that they can have a shrimp 
cocktail, a salad and top it off with a simply grilled piece of protein. The 
grilled dishes have been generally successful: One night I had a beautiful 
piece of tuna, another a large and very respectable veal chop. 
</P>
<P>
Those who are looking for more exotic eating can find that too. I found the 
best of the dishes to be tournedos of salmon -- little rounds of fish served on 
a bed of cabbage with a robust onion and black pepper sauce. Another satisfying 
dish was loin of lamb, served in beautiful rare slices draped across little 
logs of spinach and accented by the seductive potato tuiles that the kitchen 
serves with many of the dishes. These large, crisp, round disks of potatoes are 
so delicious that you may find yourself asking if you can have an order on the 
side. 
</P>
<P>
Desserts are not one of Victor Hugo's strong suits. A warm apple tart came in 
an apricot sauce that tasted mainly of honey. A lemon tart was overwhelmed by 
an unnecessary pina colada sauce. Peanut butter pie will be horrible to those 
who hate peanut butter -- and disappointing to those who don't. It was thin and 
airy, served in a graham cracker crust with a very unassertive chocolate sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The chocolate-raspberry cake, on the other hand, was delicious. I suggest that 
you finish your meal with that. As you eat it the waiter will arrive again and 
again to offer more coffee, more water -- anything that will make your meal 
more pleasant. In the face of such service, you may find yourself thinking how 
happy you are to be here. The adolescent restaurants may serve more interesting 
food -- but the grown-ups really know how to take care of you. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended dishes: Spinach salad, $7; taramasalata, $8.75; tournedos of 
salmon, $17.50; loin of lamb, $16.75; veal chop, $23.50; chocolate raspberry 
cake, $5.50.

NOTEBOOK: EXPERTS TIP THEIR HANDS ON GRATUITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alfred Cavaliere of Beverly Hills, who notes that he is "theoretically opposed 
to tipping" in restaurants but tips anyway (to the tune of at least 15%), 
writes to ask why the accepted percentage of tips seems to have gone up over 
the years? 
</P>
<P>
"Forty years ago," he writes, "a $20 (check) called for a $2 tip. The same meal 
today would cost $60, and should warrant no more than a $6 tip. But I have to 
tip $9. Why?" 
</P>
<P>
Secondly, he asks, why should a larger percentage be called for in high-priced 
restaurants than in lesser ones, "although no greater service was offered"? 
</P>
<P>
Well, to begin with, Cavaliere must have been quite the gourmand if he spent 
$20 on a meal 40 years ago. According to the 1949-vintage "Dining Out in 
Hollywood and Los Angeles" by Craig Davidson, an "expensive" dinner in that era 
would cost "probably more than $3 (per person) without cocktails." On the East 
Coast, according to "Knife and Fork in New York" by Lawton Mackall, also 
published in 1949, top restaurants would cost "more than $4 per person, 
exclusive of drinks and tips." 
</P>
<P>
More to the point, though, Davidson's book states that, while 10% might be an 
acceptable tip for breakfast and lunch in inexpensive restaurants, 10% to 15% 
is called for at dinner time. Furthermore, he adds, at top-flight restaurants 
without a captain, "the average tip is 15%-20% of the check," and at those with 
a captain, "the happy medium is 20%-25%, split one-third to the captain and 
two-thirds to the waiter." In New York, says Mackall, "the waiter . . . should 
get 15%; in a night club, 20%." Going back even further, Rian James, in his 
"Dining in New York," published in 1934, recommends tipping a quarter on checks 
of $1.50 to $2.50, 15% on checks up to $5, and "at least 20%" above $5. 
</P>
<P>
As for why higher percentages are called for at more expensive restaurants, the 
best answer I can give is simply that, at least in principle, such places do 
give "greater service." Waiters are required to know more about food in such 
places; more changes of silverware and china are invariably called for; 
table-side service is sometimes required; and it takes more time and skill to 
properly present, open, decant (if necessary), and pour a bottle of good wine 
than to pick up a couple of glasses of white zinfandel from the service bar. 
Service should be better at more expensive restaurants, in other words, and 
thus should be better compensated.

HERE TODAY GONE TAMAYO: Dr. Stan Kandel, an original majority partner in Spago, 
and the now-defunct 385 North, has relinquished day-to-day management 
responsibility at Tamayo, the upscale Mexican restaurant he helped open last 
year in East Los Angeles. Kandel's partner in the venture, David Lizarraga is 
now in charge -- though Kandel maintains his financial interest. Humberto 
Valoso, former general manager of Las Brisas restaurant in Laguna Beach, will 
some of Kandel's responsibilities. Meanwhile, high-profile local restaurateur 
Bob Morris (Gladstone's 4 Fish, R.J.'s, etc.) has signed on in a consultancy 
capacity. Morris will introduce a new menu in about two weeks, keeping some 
popular dishes from the original but adding more traditional Mexican items.

TV VIEWERS RISE UP TO DEFEND THE 'MARRIED' LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's frightening what kind of influence one person can have. Several weeks ago 
Terry Rakolta, a housewife from Bloomfield Hills, Mich., a wealthy Detroit 
suburb, launched a passionate, half-crazed, one-woman letter-writing campaign 
to protest what she considers anti-family and sexual sentiments in the TV 
sitcom, "Married . . . With Children." The action prompted at least one sponsor 
to terminate its advertising and several others to consider doing so. 
</P>
<P>
I respect Ms. Rakolta's opinions, but she in no way speaks for me or the 
millions of other viewers who enjoy this show. If she can't appreciate its 
offbeat, adult humor, she has several options, including turning the TV set off 
or to another program. 
</P>
<P>
I am disappointed in some of the show's sponsors, who seem to have about as 
much backbone as a chocolate eclair.

DEFINING COMEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harold T. Wright's March 5 letter certainly seems to define comedy differently 
than I. Among his examples of Academy Awards given to actors in comedic roles 
he includes: 
</P>
<P>
 -- William Holden for "Stalag 17," one of the most gripping and saddest dramas 
ever filmed. A few tension-breaking scenes do not a comedy make. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ingrid Bergman for "Murder on the Orient Express," a sophisticated murder 
mystery. 
</P>
<P>
George Sanders for "All About Eve," a dated but still painful story of 
conscienceless betrayal. Not comedy. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Fitzgerald for "Going My Way." Yeah, it's always high comedy to watch a 
loveable curmudgeon learn to see other views and then die. 
</P>
<P>
Edmund Gwenn in "Miracle on 34th Street," a morality play that used Santa Claus 
to make a point, ahead of its time, about child neglect. Ho, ho, ho!

LOUD BUT DECENT

Sure, the writing on shows such as "Growing Pains" and "Who's the Boss?" hovers 
between mediocre and insufficient ("Tales of Two Sitcoms," Feb. 26). But if I 
had kids, I wouldn't mind them spending one hour per week with a couple of 
"loud, dumb relatives" if it meant lessons in societal values and human 
decency.

Rakolta is concerned about my family. And I am concerned about hers. When a TV 
show (or record or book for that matter) can disrupt family relationships, that 
demonstrates a shortcoming in the family, not in the TV show. 
</P>
<P>
Rakolta and her partners in spirit (Jerry Falwell, Tipper Gore, etc.), must be 
very insecure in their values if they fear that a TV show is going to turn 
their children into social liabilities. 
</P>

I am sick of right-wing fundamentalists trying to deny me my choice of 
entertainment.

Those cynically inclined might suspect the lady of being in the employ of the 
show she attacks. The hilarious show needed more attention than the fledgling 
FOX would normally get. Voila, it has found it.

ANIMALS: PARROT PAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM JORDAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HE WAS A yellow-headed Amazon. She was of mixed background, one of her parents 
a yellow-head, the other a red-crowned Amazon. No one knows where she came 
from, according to Jeffrey Froke, the man who studied Los Angeles parrots, but 
no matter. She grew up and fell in love with her yellow-headed mate, he with 
her. 
</P>
<P>
They spent virtually all their time together. When foraging for food, they 
always stayed close to each other. At night they slept side by side. They even 
flew in close proximity when the flock was traveling. All the other parrots 
were equally committed; in fact, a parrot flock is actually a collection of 
pairs, not a group of individuals as it is with starlings, say, or shore birds. 
</P>
<P>
But in the matter of communication, they took togetherness to an extreme known 
only in Shakespearean plays. All day long, as they went about their business, 
they chattered continuously with each other in a pattern known as "antiphonal 
duetting." One would begin a call, the other would complete it. When calling 
close by, they sounded like one bird. When farther apart, they sounded like one 
stereophonic bird. Either way, the technique had the practical function of a 
safety check: "I know you're there. You know I'm here," while the flock foraged 
in the dense foliage where it's easy to lose sight of one another. This is 
standard behavior for Amazons of all kinds. 
</P>
<P>
The couple was never fully accepted by yellow-headed society; they spent their 
time on the fringes of the flock. She, using her mimicking skills, adopted the 
calls and language of the yellow-headed majority, but when a neighboring flock 
of red-crowns flew over, her kindred genes seemed to awaken and she called back 
in the speech of her other parent. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the hardships, the pair endured. When last spotted in the West Los 
Angeles area, they had been together for at least 20 years.

FROM THE RURAL areas of Tuscany and Umbria to the Mediterranean coast, from the 
villas of the northern lake regions to the Alps, it is evident that the Italian 
countryside is full of charm and beauty. "Italian Country" is a colorful, 
seasonal photographic tour of elegant villas, sun-filled coastal retreats, 
Alpine chalets, rustic farmhouses, even a converted abbey, where la dolce vita 
is apparent in everything from furnishings to regional food specialties. It's 
interesting to note how architectural and decorating styles vary among regions. 
The book ends with a valuable region-by-region travel guide that includes a 
directory of home-rental agencies, hotels, restaurants and antique and 
specialty shops, useful to those planning to vacation in rural Italy. ($35)

THE AUTHOR IS a builder with years of timber-framing experience, but he 
broadened his scope for this book to integrate all elements of new-home 
construction, including history of timber framing, design and insulation as 
well as building techniques. The photos and diagrams are useful to any 
non-builder contemplating construction or remodeling. The design chapter is 
first-rate, the color photos are handsome, and the technical information is 
rendered in thorough but understandable prose. ($24.95) JUDITH SIMS

WHITEAKER WAXES eloquent, with plenty of pastoral illustrations, about the joys 
of life and flora in rural England. The needlepoint designs have only the most 
cursory instructions; for needle-pointers who know how to set up a canvas and 
aren't intimidated by choosing their own colors, this could be a cherished 
book: lovely florals, neat repeats, bright borders. More photographs of 
finished work would have been welcomed in the place of those bucolic scenes and 
Whiteaker's rather unnecessary gardening information. ($24.95) Judith Sims

NOT SINCE THE MODEL T HAS THERE BEEN A CAR WITH THE STAYING POWER OF THE 
BELOVED VW BEETLE, AN UGLY DUCKLING THAT WAS ADOPTED BY A GENERATION OF 
ADMIRERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
People often grow fond of homely things, and perhaps nothing on wheels has ever 
been as homely, or as popular, as the Volkswagen Beetle. Not since Henry Ford's 
Model T has there been so prolific an automobile. Ubiquitous. There should to 
be a picture of the VW next to that word in every dictionary. 
</P>
<P>
The Volkswagen is known to have had several origins, but the automobile that 
truly inspired the VW's design came from none other than Mercedes-Benz. It was 
the 1936 Mercedes 170H that influenced the Volkswagen's author, Dr. Ferdinand 
Porsche. As automotive ancestry goes, having Mercedes-Benz and Porsche at your 
roots isn't too shoddy. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the shape of the rear-engined Mercedes, the VW prototypes were built 
in 1936, with the definitive form arriving in 1938. Had it not been for World 
War II, the new Wolfsburg assembly plant would have had the cars in production 
by 1940. 
</P>
<P>
Later, with Germany's factories almost decimated by Allied bombing, 
Volkswagen's reincarnation might well be attributed to the British, who took 
control of the Wolfsburg plant in May, 1945. Demand for the cars by British 
occupation forces helped put the company on the road to prosperity. By 1947, a 
dealer organization had been set up, and plans were in the works to export "The 
People's Car" to the people of the world. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1949, the first Beetle was officially shipped to the United States. 
How many of the strange-looking, air-cooled, rear-engined sedans attracted 
American buyers? 
</P>
<P>
Two. 
</P>
<P>
Not a particularly auspicious beginning. VW's first years in this country were 
unremarkable, to say the least. In three years only 2,000 were sold. And then, 
in the face of the great chromed and finned vehicles emerging from Detroit, 
Americans suddenly "discovered" the Volkswagen. Sales began to soar, and 
Wolfsburg never looked back. 
</P>
<P>
What was the VW's mystique? Styling? It had all the charisma of a beetle, a 
lasting moniker pinned on the car by American motorists. Performance? With an 
output of 36 horsepower, the Volkswagen could go fast only if dropped from a 
very great height. Features? It had few. For years, it didn't even have a gas 
gauge. Its success has been puzzling to industry analysts for decades. 
</P>
<P>
By the late '60s, the Bug had become something of a cult car, and in Southern 
California, VWs could be seen cruising the beach cities covered with Peter 
Max-style paint schemes. And, of course, there were the Beetle Boards. If you 
owned a VW in good condition, Beetle Boards of America would paint your car 
with an advertisement, (usually for cigarettes), and pay you a modest fee to 
cover maintenance costs. 
</P>
<P>
After nearly a quarter century of production, the Volkswagen became the most 
popular car in the world. On Feb. 17, 1972, the 15,007,034th Beetle was built 
in Wolfsburg, eclipsing the Model T's record as the most-produced automobile. 
</P>
<P>
Following the fuel crunch of 1973, the Beetle became even more popular in 
America. Its low-horsepower, four-cylinder engine was one of the most fuel 
efficient on the road, returning 26 miles to the gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing lasts forever. With the Bug's popularity beginning to wane in the late 
'70s, Volkswagen introduced its replacement, the Rabbit. The Beetle sedan 
passed from the showroom in 1977, and two years later, the convertible bid 
farewell.

Certain automobiles seem to radiate a sense of regality, a to-the-manor-born 
assurance that sets them apart from their more mundane relatives of the road. 
And no motorcars exhibit more regal grace than those bearing the name of the 
late Enzo Ferrari. The master craftsman's touch was much in evidence when he 
produced his 1958 250GT Series I. A mere 36 were built, each outfitted a bit 
differently by coach builder Pininfarina, and the client list was indeed royal. 
The V-12 cabriolet pictured here (yes, that's two views of one car, 
photographed at UC Irvine) was first seen at Italy's 1958 Turin Salon, where it 
caught the eye of Iraq's King Faisal, who purchased it and shipped it to the 
United States, planning to drive it on his visits to Southern California. 
However, Faisal was assassinated before he ever got behind the wheel and the 
car subsequently went through a series of owners. Today, it's the property of 
John and Linda Clinard of Irvine. Gordon Morris

New cars come and new cars go, all but a handful disappearing into the mist of 
memory. Of those that remain, some are cherished for their age alone, oddities 
from a time long past. A few, however, enjoy a different loyalty and affection; 
they're examples of an emotional elan, befitting designs that are classics from 
infancy. The 1955 Thunderbird is such an automobile; its verve and dash were 
apparent the moment it rolled off the assembly line 35 years ago. At the time, 
perhaps few realized that price alone is no indication of value; the T-bird was 
based-stickered by Ford at $2,944. Its appreciation has been steady, if not 
astonishing -- a mint model today might bring 15 times the original selling 
price. And speaking of original, we picture above the first of the flock, the 
No. 1 Thunderbird, owned by George Watts of Villa Park. WALLACE GUENTHER

On Nov. 1, 1987, Joel Steinberg, a criminal defense lawyer, beat his illegally 
adopted daughter, Lisa, into a coma. She died Nov. 5. Hedda Nussbaum, who had 
lived with Steinberg since 1976, was also in the apartment. Her face and body 
were deformed from his assaults, she had a gangrenous leg from his beatings. 
With 6-year-old Lisa lying on the bathroom floor, Steinberg went out for dinner 
and drinks. Nussbaum stayed behind. When Steinberg came home, he and Nussbaum 
freebased cocaine. Early the next day, Lisa stopped breathing and Nussbaum 
called 911. She was arrested with Steinberg, then given immunity for testifying 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg had started beating Nussbaum in 1978. In that year alone, she 
reportedly suffered at least 10 black eyes. In 1981, he ruptured her spleen. 
During this time, she worked as a children's book editor at Random House. She 
was fired in 1982, for missing too much work. Socially speaking, she was 
"disappeared." 
</P>
<P>
Many say Lisa's death is Nussbaum's fault. They mourn Lisa, they blame 
Nussbaum. A perception is growing that Nussbaum is responsible legally and 
morally for the death of Lisa Steinberg. 
</P>
<P>
I don't think Nussbaum is "innocent." I don't know any innocent adult women; 
life is harder than that for everyone. But adult women who have been battered 
are especially not innocent. Battery is a forced descent into hell and you 
don't get by in hell by moral goodness. You disintegrate. You don't survive as 
a discrete personality with a sense of right and wrong. You live in a world of 
pain, in isolation, on the verge of death, in terror; and when you get numb 
enough not to care whether you live or die you are experiencing the only grace 
God is going to send your way. Drugs help. 
</P>
<P>
I was battered when I was married and there are some things I wish people would 
understand. I thought things had changed but it is clear from the story of 
Hedda Nussbaum that nothing has. 
</P>
<P>
Your neighbors hear you screaming. They do nothing. The next day they look 
through you. If you scream for years they will look through you for years. Your 
neighbors, friends and family see the bruises and injuries -- and do nothing. 
They will not intercede. They send you back. They say it's your fault or you 
like it or they deny it is happening. Your family believes you belong with your 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
If you scream and no one helps and no one acknowledges it and people look right 
through you, you begin to feel you don't exist. If you existed and you 
screamed, someone would help you. If you existed and were visibly injured, 
someone would help you. If you existed and asked for help in escaping, someone 
would help you. 
</P>
<P>
When you go to the doctor or to the hospital because you are injured and they 
won't listen or help you or they give you tranquilizers or threaten to commit 
you because they say you are disoriented, paranoid, you begin to believe that 
he can hurt you as much as he wants and no one will help you. When the police 
refuse to help you, you begin to believe that he can hurt you or kill you and 
it will not matter because you do not exist. 
</P>
<P>
You become unable to use language because it stops meaning anything. If you try 
to say you have been hurt and by whom and you point to visible injuries and are 
treated as if you made it up or as if it doesn't matter or as if it is your 
fault or as if you are worthless, you become afraid to say anything. You cannot 
talk to anyone because they will not help you and if you do talk, the man who 
is battering you will hurt you more. Once you lose language, your isolation is 
absolute. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually I waited to die. I wanted to die. I hoped the next beating would 
kill me. When I would come to after being beaten unconscious, the first feeling 
I had was a sorrow that I was alive. 
</P>
<P>
I would ask God to let me die now. My breasts were burned with lit cigarettes. 
My husband beat my legs with a wood beam so that I couldn't walk. I was present 
when he did immoral things to other people, when he hurt other people. I didn't 
help them. Nussbaum's guilt is not foreign to me. 
</P>
<P>
A junkie said he would give me a ticket to far away and $1,000 if I would carry 
a briefcase through customs. I said I would. I knew it had heroin in it. I kept 
hoping I would be caught and sent to jail because in jail he couldn't beat me. 
</P>
<P>
I had been sexually abused in the Women's House of Detention in New York City 
(arrested for an anti-Vietnam War demonstration) so I didn't have the idea that 
jail was a friendly place. I just hoped I would get five years and for five 
years I could sit in a jail cell and not be hit by him. In the end the junkie 
didn't give me the briefcase to carry, so I didn't get the $1,000. He did 
kindly give me the ticket. I stole the money I needed. Escape is heroic, isn't 
it? 
</P>
<P>
I've been living with a kind and gentle man I love for the last 15 years. For 
eight of those years, I would wake up screaming in blind terror, not knowing 
who I was, where I was, who he was, cowering and shaking. I'm more at peace 
now. But I've refused until recently to have my books published in the country 
where my former husband lives, and I've refused important professional 
invitations to go there. Once I went there in secret for four days to try to 
face it down. I couldn't stop trembling and sweating. I could barely breathe. 
There still isn't a day when I don't feel fear that I will see him and he will 
hurt me. 
</P>
<P>
Death looks different to a woman who has been battered: It seems not nearly so 
cruel as life. I'm upset by the phony mourning for Lisa Steinberg -- the 
hypocritical sentimentality of a society that would not really mind her being 
beaten to death once she was an adult. 
</P>
<P>
If Lisa hadn't died, she would be on West 10th Street being tortured -- now. 
Why was it that we wanted her to live? So that when the child became a woman 
and then was raped or beaten or prostituted we could look right through her? 
It's bad to hit a girl before she's of age. It's bad to torture a girl before 
she's of age. Then she's of age and, well, it isn't so bad; because she wants 
it, she likes it, she chose it. 
</P>
<P>
Why is it all right to hurt adult women? Those who love children but don't 
think adult women deserve much precisely because we are not innocent -- we are 
used and compromised and culpable -- should try to remember this: The only way 
to have helped Lisa Steinberg was to have helped Nussbaum. But to do it, you 
would have had to care that an adult woman was being hurt -- care enough to 
rescue her. 
</P>
<P>
There was a little boy there too, Mitchell, 17 months old, tied up and covered 
in feces. And the only way to have spared him was to rescue Hedda. Now he has 
been tortured and he did not die. What kind of man will he grow up to be? I 
wish there was a way to take the hurt from him. There isn't. Is there a way to 
stop him from becoming a batterer? Is there?

TRASH TO MATCH OUR MOUNTAINS: CALIFORNIA'S GROWING WASTE WOE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

magazine.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Public officials throughout California pray for a scientific messiah to rescue 
them from the growing garbage crisis. Ideally, the technological rescuer would 
recycle California's daily mountains of waste through an inexpensive and 
non-polluting process that is unseen, unheard, unsmelled and located in 
somebody else's back yard. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no laser beam that zaps waste and makes it go away," reports George 
T. Eowan, chief executive officer of the state Waste Management Board. "That's 
what everyone is looking for." 
</P>
<P>
Prayers unanswered, state and local officials are at last dealing with 
solid-waste as a major, urgent problem. The state board estimates that landfill 
capacity will be exhausted for 70% of California in less than eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian announced in his State of the State address that a top 
1989 priority is "development of an integrated waste-management proposal," 
working "toward the goal of waste reduction and greater recycling." 
</P>
<P>
Eowan and other specialists plan to present the Legislature with a detailed 
proposal later this month. The program is expected to take a carrot-and-stick 
approach, forcing each region to take action while providing funds -- perhaps 
through a bond issue -- to lighten the fiscal burden on cities and counties. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, California depended on landfills or garbage dumps close to urban 
areas. The state is so prosperous, it has become the world's foremost throwaway 
society, producing more than 40 million tons of waste a year -- about 8 1/2 
pounds of waste per day per person, compared with five for the nation as a 
whole, three for Canada and two for Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Landfills are now undesirable because they leach toxics that contaminate ground 
water and because garbage dumps are no longer acceptable close to developed 
areas. Local officials tried to reduce landfill need by exploring 
waste-to-energy incineration, a process used extensively in many other parts of 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists protested: Such plants create smog and produce an ash residue 
that can contain additional pollutants. Neighborhood groups joined the 
opposition. In San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, the waste-to-energy 
solution was abandoned. California now has only three fairly small plants in 
the City of Commerce, Long Beach and Stanislaus County. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists push maximum recycling. But that poses new problems. Some 
materials are difficult to reuse. There is no demand for others. Even the 
market for newsprint may be fading away. The American Paper Institute, an 
industry trade association, predicts that so much old newspaper will soon hit 
the market that some of it may have to be dumped in landfills. And the 
NIMBYsyndrome -- "not in my back yard" -- now applies to recycling plants and 
even drop-off centers. 
</P>
<P>
So "garbology" is a lose-lose issue for politicians. Few state elected 
officials have chosen to deal with the subject other than on the safe turf of 
recycling. One exception is Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin (D-Union City), who 
describes the paralysis this way: 
</P>
<P>
"City officials want waste disposal that's cheap and easy but not nearby -- a 
patently inconsistent set of objectives. The disposal industry wants to cut its 
legal exposure by surrounding landfills with buffer zones. But it doesn't want 
to buy the land. Environmentalists oppose burning and landfilling, and they 
support recycling. But today only 10% of our trash is recycled and nobody wants 
to wade around in the other 90% until recycling can handle more." 
</P>
<P>
She has come up with her own acronym,TWABAL -- "there will always be a 
landfill" -- to help put the issue in focus. She says it is unrealistic to 
expect Californians to learn the lost art of efficient consumption and recycle 
to the maximum. State growth and continued use of non-recyclable materials 
guarantee that dumping grounds will always be needed; even with incineration, 
the ash must be buried. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, companies selling waste-to-energy technology thought California 
garbage would turn to gold. They spent fortunes trying to sell their technology 
in metropolitan areas. Now, having been defeated all over the map, the industry 
has essentially written off California. Wheelabrator Environmental Systems, 
after investing several million dollars in San Diego, announced withdrawal from 
the California market. Ogden Martin Systems built the Stanislaus plant but lost 
the big prize in Los Angeles; now it concentrates on other states. 
</P>
<P>
Ogden's Joey Garcia claims that California will one day face the choice between 
traditional landfills and waste-to-energy plants. Given that choice, surveys by 
the National Solid Waste Management Assn. show that the public will choose 
incineration. Garcia offers yet another acronym to explain why local officials 
have delayed the day of decision: NIMEY -- "not in my election year." NIMEY no 
longer applies to Deukmejian, who has already announced he will not seek a 
third term; that may explain why his Administration is suddenly attempting to 
take the lead on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The governor a few weeks ago told The Times' George Skelton that he wants to 
abandon landfilling and employ incineration or "some other form of destroying 
waste." What form? "I don't know. I'm not an engineer. You know the way they do 
things now. They come along with lasers or something and all of a sudden, zap, 
it's gone," he said. Meanwhile, his aides try to develop a program that will 
work until the zapper arrives. 
</P>
<P>
Even in the tightly controlled Deukmejian Administration, mounting waste has 
produced mounting internal conflict. Rivalry developed between the Department 
of Conservation, which runs the statewide container recycling program, and the 
Solid Waste Management Board, which generally supervises garbage-disposal 
programs. The governor recently ordered the agencies to cooperate because he 
wants his Administration to speak with one voice before the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Like local officials, the state has been looking for an easy solution through 
technology. Meanwhile, Eowan reports some scientific advances that may relieve 
a little pressure. Two examples: 
</P>
<P>
 -- German and French firms have developed techniques -- yes, using lasers -- 
that sort materials by color, texture, weight, toxicity and other factors. 
Plastics, in heavy demand by recyclers, can be isolated by this technology. On 
the downside, the process is very expensive, untested in the United States and 
still doesn't dispose of non-recyclables. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A Minnesota plant is taking shredded tires, adding chemicals and producing 
molded consumer products. Eowan thinks this could at least solve the problem of 
discarded tires. 
</P>
<P>
Minus a major technological breakthrough and with opposition to incineration 
still strong, some communities look for landfills far from the urban centers. 
</P>
<P>
California is growing at the rate of 600,000 residents a year; there isn't much 
land left that won't soon be in somebody's back yard or in a protected 
open-space zone. One day state and local officials will be forced to give 
citizens what they don't want -- refuse restrictions and much higher garbage 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
The problem piles so high, Eowan warns that Californians can't pick and choose 
between alternate solutions: "We've got to do everything," he said.

'BENNETT THE DRUG CZAR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the midst of the debate over a picking a secretary of defense, a dangerous 
Bush nominee may be confirmed unchallenged. Drug czar-designate Bennett has 
admitted a willingness, almost a longing, to sacrifice the Bill of Rights in 
his war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
While I halfway expected such a fascist reaction from ex-Education Secretary 
Bennett, I was shocked and saddened by the lack of protest against him. Surely 
a madcap disregard for civil liberties is as frightening as a drunk defense 
secretary would have been. 
</P>
<P>
If Bennett's views become Administration policy, police would no longer have to 
exhibit probable cause. They would not need warrants to search and seize 
anything which could contain drugs, including urine. 
</P>
<P>
If Bennett truly wants a drug-free America, why doesn't he turn his attentions 
toward the causes of abuse and addiction -- an almost palpable despair in our 
cities and among our poor. Drugs provide both an emotional and financial 
escape. In any other field Republicans would probably congratulate them on 
their capitalistic gumption. 
</P>
<P>
The need for escape would become even greater with Bennett as drug czar. It's 
enough to make one a Bolshevik.

<P>
I read with great alarm Bennett's belief that "compelling reasons" should allow 
the government to suspend the Constitution, in particular, the Fourth 
Amendment. Anyone with even a high school knowledge of history can see the 
terrifying parallels throughout history, from ancient Rome to Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
No one can deny there is a drug problem in this country (indeed, the world). 
Yet, it seems to me the worse part of this problem is the fascist who wants to 
use drugs as an excuse to eliminate our freedoms. Look back over the last 30 
years or so. Is there anyone who would really trust our government without the 
Constitution as a muzzle? 
</P>
<P>
Bennett said, " . . . You can't destroy the fabric of the country in order to 
defend the country." But America is the Constitution. It is what makes our 
country free and unique. If you destroy the Constitution, there still might be 
a place between Canada and Mexico, but it sure won't be America.

MONARCH BUTTERFLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As insignificant as the protection of butterflies and their habitat may seem in 
an era of nuclear tensions, I was pleased to read in your editorial that 
development of Santa Barbara's northern coast is being hindered by swarms of 
Monarchs living in the eucalyptus groves there. 
</P>
<P>
I am fortunate enough to be one of the people whose homes and back yards these 
delicate creatures grace with their presence, adding beauty and color to an 
area that is quickly becoming overcrowded and stressful. 
</P>
<P>
Even if not everyone is able to come and enjoy the sight of thousands of orange 
and black butterflies flying freely and serving absolutely no economic purpose, 
I believe that most are content just knowing that there are places in the state 
where phenomena like this still exist. If we lose these groves and their 
ethereal inhabitants, then we all lose something beyond measure for the poor 
exchange of a resort hotel and a few condos. 
</P>
<P>
One can only hope the Monarchs survive the political process that will decide 
their fate. 
</P>
<P>
Please do what you can to help.

'BENNETT THE DRUG CZAR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial ("Bennett the Drug Czar," March 4) regarding the appointment of 
William Bennett to the position of drug czar misses the point rather badly. 
</P>
<P>
I'm certainly no fan of the Reagan agenda, which placed so many right-wing 
zealots, including Bennett, in senior positions. On the other hand, Bennett, 
for all his "diplomatic" shortcomings, did shake up the educational 
establishment, and pointed out very glaring deficiencies in the system. 
</P>
<P>
I'm far more concerned with the toll the drug world exacts on this society than 
I am over the niceties of constitutional rights or a comparison of whether 
we're in a serious war or a so-so war. If it takes the suspension of habeas 
corpus and the involvement of the military to get this filth out of America, 
then so be it. 
</P>
<P>
We are, or should be, at war. Ask the parent of a child innocently shot in a 
drug dealer's fight. Ask the mother whose husband has gone down the tubes and 
out of her life, with his arms scarred from needles. Question the loved ones of 
those with AIDS, contracted through dirty needles. The aimless stupidity of 
youngsters wandering around with a pocket full of drug-related money, and an 
empty head -- dropouts, losers, and ultimately burdens to society. 
</P>
<P>
The list goes on and on. If this isn't war, what the hell is? 
</P>
<P>
So come on, Bennett. Sock it to 'em wherever and however you can. To do less 
would be to approach this war as we did the one in Vietnam, and we all know 
where that got us.

<TEXT>
<P>
Bennett's statements that he would advocate suspending our constitutional 
rights are the natural progression of an ever-more fascistic approach by our 
government to the drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
Elected officials are playing on people's legitimate fears about the horrible 
crimes associated with drug gangs and dealers. They are advocating increased 
police force against the problem because that is an easy and immediate thing to 
do. However, the cure these officials are advocating could be more untenable 
than the disease. 
</P>
<P>
People seem to forget that there is a demand side to the drug problem. There 
are millions of regular users of marijuana, cocaine, and other drugs. Most of 
these drug users are not violent people. They are escapists and pleasure 
seekers, just like the guy at the local bar downing beer after beer. 
</P>
<P>
Until the drug users in this country can be somehow persuaded to give up their 
habit, there will continue to be a booming drug market and low-life 
entrepreneurs cruelly competing for business in this illegal arena. 
</P>
<P>
If you want someone to blame for our drug problem, look at your friends at 
parties who are smoking a joint or sniffing cocaine. These are the people who 
ultimately will be responsible for you having to dump out the contents of your 
luggage for inspection, or you having to take a drug test to get a job. Or, as 
Bennett would have it, for being stopped and searched on the street without a 
warrant by a military policeman. 
</P>
<P>
As someone who does not use drugs, I am alarmed that my civil liberties and 
those of my friends may be endangered by a government blindly charging ahead in 
a misguided war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Before unwarranted force against civilians is unleashed, the true root cause of 
the problem -- a great number of people anesthetizing themselves against 
reality -- should be faced and dealt with. 
</P>
<P>
All the dogs, barbed wire and guns in the world are not going to prevent the 
transaction between junkie and dealer if both feel they have something to gain 
from the experience.

Enough already! 
</P>
<P>
The time has come to take a hard look at the drug epidemic and prescribe a new, 
and hopefully, better treatment than the present failed "war on drugs." We are 
not losing the current war -- we have lost it. 
</P>
<P>
It is time now to legalize the drugs, and sell them in government-controlled 
stores. Legalization does not denote endorsement of using drugs, anymore than 
repeal of the Volstead Act endorsed the use of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
The benefits are obvious. The government sells the drugs to one and all at 
one-tenth the current cost, thus decimating the wave of robberies and personal 
assaults that now make up 80% of current crime. This would do away with foreign 
and domestic drug merchants, and their obscene amounts of cash. Banks and 
brokerage houses would no longer be tempted to launder illegal monies, and the 
drug-addicted population would be controlled. 
</P>
<P>
Now is the time for reassessment of a failed policy, and time for a mid-course 
correction. Anti-substance education would include all abused drugs: alcohol, 
narcotics, uppers, and downers. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, new and tough laws, quickly and evenly enforced, would put all 
peddlers of drugs in jail for long terms, at hard labor.

Whittle Communications of Knoxville, Tenn., wants to give 8,000 American high 
schools $250 million worth of TV sets, video recorders and satellite dishes. In 
return, the schools must promise to make "Channel One," Whittle's daily 
12-minute newscast that includes two minutes of commercials, required viewing 
for all students. How bad a bargain is it? Not bad at all, I think, if teachers 
realize what Whittle and its advertisers have provided them: A free casebook 
for a course in media criticism. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the possibility seems to have been ignored. Education groups, including 
the American Federation of Teachers, the National Education Assn. and the 
National PTA have already come out against the program, which premiered Monday 
in a five-week test at six high schools, including one in Cerritos, Calif. 
Peggy Charren of Action for Children's Television, a citizen's group, has 
called the students a "captive audience" and the program "an advertiser's 
dream." 
</P>
<P>
Neither charge is entirely true. The students are required to come to school 
and to view "Channel One"; in that sense they are indeed captive. But as 
experienced television watchers, teen-agers know quite a bit about advertising. 
They are not likely to take the ads very seriously -- unless, of course, 
teachers ask them to take them seriously. 
</P>
<P>
That is exactly what should happen. The commercials and the newscast ought to 
become the focus of a daily discussion about the manipulative tactics of 
advertising, the vagaries of a consumer culture, the uses and misuses of 
imagery, the limitations of television news, and the power and reach of modern 
communications. These are important lessons for any citizen of the electronic 
age, and students are often eager to learn them. But such lessons will be lost 
unless teachers go out of their way to encourage criticism and discussion. 
</P>
<P>
A classroom full of listless teen-agers, dutifully attending to television as 
one more routine in a dreary school day, may very well be an advertiser's 
dream. Part of what makes a TV audience valuable to an advertiser is the 
passivity and silence of the viewer. But anyone who has watched television with 
a large group of friends knows how tempting it is to comment on the show and 
poke fun at the commercials. 
</P>
<P>
When we're surrounded by others we know and trust, advertising's attempts to 
fill us with fear or promise us the world can seem ludicrously overblown. 
Watching television together, we may still be an audience, but we also have an 
audience -- each other. The impulse to talk back to the box for our own 
amusement (and protection) is a natural one. A classroom, then, is an ideal 
environment for talking back to television, and the fact that "Channel One" 
carries advertisements only gives teachers and students more to talk about. 
</P>
<P>
To offer the materials for a daily exercise in media criticism is not, of 
course, the aim of Whittle Communications. There is no reason to think the 
company has anything but its own profits in mind. Indeed, there is something 
frightening in the decision by schools to subject their pupils to "Channel 
One." It is one thing when students park themselves in front of the TV set at 
home and choose to endure the ad. It is quite another when school, in effect, 
sells access to its students' minds for a fee, especially when attendance is 
mandated. What theory of custodianship gives school officials the right to 
barter away the time and attention of their pupils? I can see none. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Whittle, chairman of the company that bears his name, has argued 
that if government funds cannot meet the needs of the schools, then other 
sources, like "Channel One," ought to be found. But surely Charren has a point 
when she says that the proper solution to inadequate funding for the schools is 
more government support, not the privatization of public education. 
</P>
<P>
All of these objections must be admitted. But so must the opportunity Whittle 
has unwittingly extended to educators. Whatever the circumstances that brought 
them there, commercials do have a place in the schools, as objects of study and 
targets of criticism. 
</P>
<P>
Whittle doesn't apologize to teachers for trying to turn their classrooms into 
just another profit center. Teachers shouldn't apologize for subverting the 
goals of his program and instructing their students in the art of critical 
viewing.

ON VIEW: FOOTLIGHTERS PLAN A HEAVENLY NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU LOPER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cabaret curtain will part revealing the gates of heaven. That's because the 
Footlighters are angels. In the past decade alone they have raised more than $1 
million for charity. They kick up their heels each year in a fund-raising 
cabaret. 
</P>
<P>
Now that they're celebrating their 50th anniversary, little surprise they've 
opted for the theme, "Heaven Sent" for their Cabaret Ball on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
This year's honorary chairman, Barbara Billingsley, a longtime Footlighter, is 
promising -- along with president Sandra Young, ball chairman Susie Gordinier 
and production chairman Barbara Mortensen -- that this will be the most 
fabulous cabaret yet. They will romp at the Beverly Hilton, raising funds for 
the Footlighter Child Life Center, the Harbor/UCLA Medical Center and Stepping 
Stone, a Santa Monica youth crisis center. 
</P>
<P>
PASCAL: Glass sculptor Pascal, also known for her blond topknot and her 
tailored men's suits worn with her own miniature jeweled sculptures (frequently 
pastel green), is being honored at a Thursday dinner party at the Bistro after 
her Diamond Year Retrospective at the Dyansen Gallery in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The retrospective and the dinner celebrate her 75th birthday. Joining to host 
the party are Mary Jane and Charles Wick (former USIA director), Ginny and 
Henry Mancini and Mr. and Mrs. Helmut Swarovski (he heads the Swarovski crystal 
manufacturing company). 
</P>
<P>
A couple of years ago Pascal was honored by the National Arts Assn. Her roster 
of collectors is impressive: Prince Charles, Frank Sinatra, Winthrop 
Rockefeller, Barbara Walters, the Vatican, U.N. headquarters in Geneva, 
Longacres Race Track in Seattle, even the Louvre. She is currently creating a 
limited edition of miniature sculptures, but, thinking big, too, she is 
completing a 10-year project titled "Seated Torso" from an 18,000-pound hunk of 
glass. 
</P>
<P>
CREATIVE CONTROL: Andrea Gregg, chairman of Pasadena Junior League's Center 
Stage -- the major fashion show that funds the league's community endeavors -- 
was explaining how important it was for the league "to regain control of the 
creativity" of the annual fashion show it launched so successfully six years 
ago. Thus, this year, with a whole lot of chat, the league opted to produce the 
show themselves with a hired independent producer and think big and 
differently. They had to raise $50,000 more than last year to produce the show. 
That meant $200,000 was needed ($65,000 of it in underwriting) to net $115,000. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed to work for the luncheon, evening party and double fashion show. 
Chairman Gregg, president Cynthia Perucca, first chairman Karen Goodyear (who 
flew in from London to support her friends) and production chairman Susan 
Ralston-McCormick and finance chairman Michael Ann Ewing (daughter of former 
Ambassador to Ireland Peter and Jackie Daily) were all in tears, happily so, by 
the end of the noon luncheon when the audience was on its feet cheering. 
</P>
<P>
They had hired Karen Burdett Productions to do the show, contracted 
independently with purveyors for the fashions, worked closely with 
Bonaventure's executive chef Werner Glur (white chocolate Formula I racing cars 
for the evening menu). The show, in fact, started with the roar of engines and 
the call, "Gentlemen, start your engines," just like Indy. That all was a 
subtle way to increase male attendance at the evening show (the luncheon is 
primarily female). "I have goose bumps," said Andrea Gregg, who had ordered up 
racing jackets and white pants to be worn by her committee at weekly meetings 
all year. 
</P>
<P>
This is a fashion show in which members, husbands and children model. The crowd 
was close to 1,000 -- including Bob Gregg, quick on his feet when son Kurt 
walked out in The Prep Shop togs. Dan Baker had a big grin for daughter 
Catherine. And most popular on the runway were Deborah McAbee, Lisa Halpern, 
Judy Morse, Bo Gusstafson (Polytechnic basketball star), Adam Jones, Susan 
Gilomen and Pamela Hillings Tegtmeyer. 
</P>
<P>
FIRST-EVER: New Start for 14 years has quietly provided low-cost outpatient 
substance abuse counseling in Santa Monica -- each year to 475 young adults and 
150 teens, plus an additional 210 teens in the Santa Monica-Malibu school 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Now, it's on the receiving line. It holds its first-ever fund-raising dinner 
Saturday at DC-3, the new restaurant on the north side of the Santa Monica 
Airport. To be honored are Olympic Gold Medalist Jackie Joyner Kersee, L.A. 
Raider Howie Long, Lakers Jerry West and Orlando Woolridge, All-American wide 
receiver Erik Affholter and All-American quarterback Rodney Peete. 
</P>
<P>
ANOTHER FIRST: For several years representatives of prestigious Wall Street 
investment firms have participated in a basketball tournament, giving funds to 
the New York Multiple Sclerosis Society. Last year the Wall Street Charity 
Classic moved to Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
Now Richard J. Capalbo, president, CEO and chairman of Bateman Eichler, Hill 
Richards, Inc., and Robert Juneman, director of the Southern California Region 
of Dean Witter Reynolds, are spearheading next Sunday's tourney at the Great 
Western Forum in Inglewood. The goal is $100,000 for MS research. The funds 
will come from team fees ($5,000), contributions, and silent and live auctions. 
We'll tell you the names (for short) of the participating teams -- Bateman, 
Dean, Drexel, Kidder, M. L., Merrill, Morgan, Prudential, Morgan (yes, two), 
Jones. Sounds like fun. 
</P>
<P>
THEY CARE: Last year CARES, the Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center 
Auxiliary, cared so much with its CARES benefit California National Horse Show 
that it netted $100,000 for its child and family program. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Lombardo, Weta Mathies and Anita Tsuji are doing it again for the seventh 
annual Wednesday through Sunday at the Los Angeles Equestrian Center. The 
National Horse Show will feature the $25,000 California National Grandprix, a 
member event of the Michelob-AGA Series and a World Cup Qualifying Event. 
</P>
<P>
President Carol Mishell, Polly Clark, Emily Peck and Gerry Williams have sent 
the invitations for the Horse Show Dinner on Friday. Bill Shoemaker will be on 
hand to autograph his book, "Shoemaker." Among those riding in the show will be 
Bill and Marcy Shatner and Cindy Shoemaker. Admission is free every day between 
8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. (except for the Sunday Grandprix). The evening events have 
tabs.

DIABETIC ASKS ODDS OF BECOMING MOTHER; 
</P>
<P>
WOMAN WITH DISEASE UNDER CONTROL SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONCEIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I have diabetes, and I realize that I will have to take certain 
precautions if I plan to become pregnant, both before and during that time that 
I'm pregnant. I've read a good deal about this. But I haven't read anything 
about whether it will be harder for me to become pregnant, and I would 
appreciate any information. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: A woman whose diabetes is in good control is as fertile as any other 
woman, and should be able to conceive just as readily. However, a woman whose 
diabetes is not in good control may have trouble ovulating, and this can 
adversely affect her ability to conceive. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How much water or other fluids should a person drink? When I'm thirsty, I 
drink, and when I'm not thirsty, I don't. That always seemed to me to be a 
sensible way to do things, but from what other people have told me, that's not 
enough. I'm very puzzled by all this. 
</P>
<P>
A: I believe you would not be puzzled if you simply bear in mind that thirst 
alone is not a reliable indication of how much a person should drink. This is 
especially true of older people, whose thirst mechanism appears to lose its 
effectiveness as they age. Older people are also more prone to dehydration 
because their kidneys are less efficient in retaining water. 
</P>
<P>
Because thirst is an unreliable guide, the rule is to have six to eight cups of 
fluid daily, whether or not you are thirsty. Appropriate fluids for this 
purpose include water, milk and fruit juice. Fluids to be avoided include 
alcohol and caffeine-containing beverages such as coffee, tea and cola drinks; 
these fluids increase water output. 
</P>
<P>
Even a fluid intake of six to eight cups does not completely replace the amount 
lost each day; however, solid foods also contain water, and this goes to make 
up the balance. For example, water comprises more than 80% of most fruits and 
vegetables, and more than 50% of meat.

ERMA BOMBECK: A GROWING THREAT FROM PEER PRESSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is with great pride I tell you that I can still be shocked. It's not easy in 
today's world, where guns are shot and no one flinches, and children are fought 
over and no one cries. 
</P>
<P>
I was shocked the other day by a survey that said by the age of 13, boys who 
had never had a sexual experience were in the minority, and sexually 
inexperienced girls were in the minority by age 15. By the time children 
entered high school, 55% of them had engaged in sex. I'm not going to pull the 
old chestnut, "In my day, at that age, I still had a doll on my bed and was 
picking broccoli out of my braces." This is not "my day,' and times have 
changed. But peer pressure hasn't changed in 200 years. 
</P>
<P>
Peer pressure is a force to be dealt with. It's bigger than we are -- stronger 
than we are. It supersedes the love of our mothers, the threats of our fathers, 
the wisdom of our grandparents and even the strength of our own convictions. It 
makes a knee hanging out of a rip in your jeans all right. It makes skipping 
school cool. It makes drinking, taking drugs and sleeping around acceptable. 
It's not important what you do . . . just so long as everyone else is doing it 
with you. 
</P>
<P>
What's unique about peer pressure is that every generation believes they 
invented it. It's brand-new, and they are the first ones to deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
Kids have been dealing with it since "The Scarlet Letter," when I suspect 
Hester's mother told her daughter, "You fool around and you'll end up wearing a 
piece of costume jewelry that does not stand for Academic Achievement." 
</P>
<P>
My parents fought peer pressure with dire predictions. If you had sex before 
you were married, you went blind, your skin broke out and you glowed in the 
dark. If you broke the curfew or wrecked the car, you were a dead person. If 
you smoked a cigarette, you couldn't come out of your room until your wedding 
day. 
</P>
<P>
My generation of parents spawned yet another approach: the Compromise Two-Step. 
All the other parents were dancing to it, so we too gave in to some peer 
pressure. We were relieved to know our kids were smoking only cigarettes, not 
pot. Our son was living with someone . . . thank God it was a girl. Our 
children were engaging in sex, but at least they were prepared. They weren't 
studying, but at least they were still living at home. 
</P>
<P>
We are in the throes of a new approach to peer pressure -- "Just Say No!" 
Putting those three little words up against peer pressure is like Pee-wee 
Herman facing off with Ted Koppel. How can kids say no when parents can barely 
say it? 
</P>
<P>
How about, "Be Prepared to Live With Yes!"? Drugs will personally screw up your 
present and your future genetically. Sex in high school is what fills out a 
graduation gown, if you're lucky enough to graduate or escape disease. If you 
begin to "prove" your masculinity/femininity, love, loyalty and independence, 
when does it stop? 
</P>
<P>
Peer pressure carries one of the highest price tags around. Parents and kids 
alike must ask themselves, "Can we afford it?"

Re "For Atheists, There's No Room at the Inn for Bibles" by Jesse Katz, Feb.

If they don't want to read it, that's fine. Who cares? But their proposal to 
ban it puts them in a class with the Ayatollah. Any validity they may have had 
is totally compromised by this dumb action.

MARY BETH WHITEHEAD'S ROLE -- AFTER BABY M 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Will Mary Beth Whitehead never go away? 
</P>
<P>
Baby M is now 3 years old. The courts have ruled, and re-ruled, about who 
should get custody of her. Even Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould acknowledges that she 
and the Sterns have buried the hatchet. Thus, I was appalled to open the paper 
and see Whitehead-Gould using a public forum to state her case yet again 
("After Baby M" by Donald P. Myers, Newsday, March 6). 
</P>
<P>
In your long article Whitehead-Gould asks sarcastically, "What did Bill Stern 
do? He put some sperm in a cup." She says that the judge who originally awarded 
custody to the Sterns is a "rotten, horrible man, and I don't know how he 
sleeps at night." Further, "When she grows up, Sassy (Baby M) may look at Bill 
Stern and say, 'How could you do that to my mother?' " She also says that "(the 
Sterns are) naive to think that this child is not going to have problems." 
</P>
<P>
I cannot help but wonder what will Melissa Stern think when she grows up and 
discovers that her biological mother has profited from the telling of her 
misfortune? What will Melissa Stern think when she's old enough to realize that 
her biological mother continued to denigrate both her father and the woman who 
raised her, in public, years after the courts had made their decision? What 
will Melissa Stern think when she realizes that her biological mother would not 
let her grow up peacefully, and quietly?

ON AGING: A WEEK TO RECOGNIZE OLDER WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By The UCLA/USC Long-Term Care Gerontology Center 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carmen Ugalde was 68 when she accepted a human services job with the city of 
Montebello. After three years of widowhood, Ugalde wanted more social life and 
supplemental income. She credits her return to work with bringing her back into 
the mainstream of life. 
</P>
<P>
Her supervisor, Marie Bagwell, describes Ugalde as a "dedicated, efficient 
person" who "accurately fields all questions from City Hall and the public." 
</P>
<P>
Ugalde demonstrates the characteristics of older workers, whose contributions 
are celebrated during National Employ the Older Worker Week, March 12-18. Since 
it was first observed by the American Legion in 1959, U.S. Presidents, 
governors, mayors and other officials have joined in declaring this a week to 
celebrate the talents older men and women bring to the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In Every Sector 
</P>
<P>
More than 13 million people 55 and older are in the labor force. While they 
work in every sector of the economy, most are in service and trade industries. 
Fifty-five percent work in white-collar occupations. 
</P>
<P>
In California, the Los Angeles Council on Careers for Older Americans is 
coordinating an older-worker poster contest and reception honoring older 
workers at the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum. The winning poster will be 
distributed to 10,000 businesses and community organizations. Says Phyllis 
Meltzer, chairperson for the event: "Our theme is 'Western Classics' because 
that is what we believe California's older workers are." 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas ABLE, a senior employment program in Little Rock, plans a lunch to 
honor employers with strong records of hiring older workers. ABLE, or Ability 
Based on Long Experience, also distributes place mats announcing the week to 
local restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
The Older Kansas Employment Program in Manhattan has encouraged a local 
discount variety store to pay for newspaper ads congratulating employers who 
have hired older workers during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Question: I am a 74-year-old nurse. Recently, the new head nurse decided that I 
should retire and asked me directly to resign. She then wrote a negative review 
of my work, which her managers refused to sign because they thought it didn't 
reflect my performance. 
</P>
<P>
Her most recent tactic was to transfer me from the night shift to the day 
shift, disrupting a schedule I've had for years. I believe I'm being 
discriminated against because of age. What recourse do I have? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act prohibits 
discrimination against most workers 40 and older in virtually every aspect of 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
To pursue an age discrimination case, you need only establish an apparent 
violation of the law. This means showing that you are in the protected age 
group and were adversely affected by some employment action in which age was a 
consideration. The burden then shifts to your employer, who must defend his or 
her actions. 
</P>
<P>
Age discrimination charges must be filed, in person or by mail, with the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission within 180 days of the discriminatory act. 
(In states with age discrimination laws, you have 300 days.) 
</P>
<P>
Be aware that you may wait months for an EEOC investigator to be assigned to 
your case. If you want faster action, consider filing a private lawsuit or 
using your organization's established grievance procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My brother and I recently returned home to Kansas City for the funeral of 
our 87-year-old uncle. The only family we have left in the area is his 
89-year-old widow, who has always been a free spirit and thinker. I stayed with 
my aunt for several days after the funeral, and she said that, should she 
become terminally ill, she wants no heroic attempts to save her life. 
</P>
<P>
I couldn't tell if she really means this or if it was a reaction to the death 
of her husband of 65 years. How do I determine if she is competent to make this 
judgment? 
</P>
<P>
A: Competence is a legal concept that can be determined only by a legal 
proceeding. The general assumption is that competent people can decide whether 
to accept proposed medical treatment. The law assumes a person is competent 
unless a hearing determines otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Your aunt may be reacting to her profound loss. Sometimes the death of a loved 
one triggers depression and a person's judgment may come into question. It's 
too early to judge in her case. People may verbalize wishes for their own death 
after such a loss, and those wishes usually changes with time. 
</P>
<P>
You may want to contact your aunt's physician and ask that she be given some 
added attention in the next few months.

ROGER SIMON: CURIOSITY WHETTED BY A WATER-BED KING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROGER SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Up there on the second level of the mall, just past the Sears, people will 
sometimes stop and watch Jonny D. bounce. 
</P>
<P>
He works in the water-bed store and they'll see him, tie flying, coattails 
flapping, jumping up and down on the beds to demonstrate their reliability. 
</P>
<P>
And Jonny D. does not cut corners. Jonny D. does not cheat. 
</P>
<P>
Jonny D. leaves his shoes on. 
</P>
<P>
"Total . . . confidence," Jonny D. will say in between bounces, "total . . . 
reliability." 
</P>
<P>
Jonny D., also known as Jonathan Davis, 25, of Baltimore, likes to sell water 
beds. Which is like saying Orel Hershiser likes to throws baseballs. Jonny D. 
loves water beds. He loves the people who own water beds. But most of all he 
loves the people who walk into his store with some hesitation about water beds. 
That means he gets to talk to them. 
</P>
<P>
"This place," he said with the sweep of his hand, "is wonderful for meeting new 
and interesting people." 
</P>
<P>
I looked around and saw a bunch of beds. But Jonny D. looks around and sees 
families. Friends. Neighbors. Each gently sloshing in his sleep. 
</P>
<P>
To be honest, I don't really care about water beds. But I care about people who 
care about things. And Jonny D. cares with a passion. 
</P>
<P>
Some weeks ago, I had a line in one of my "Simon Says" columns that said: "I 
can't believe there are still water-bed stores." 
</P>
<P>
And so Jonny D. called me. About 26 times. "Come on out to the store," he said 
each time. "Come on out and see them. Touch them. Experience them." 
</P>
<P>
I put him off and put him off. But then I had to get a haircut and was near his 
mall and so I dropped in. 
</P>
<P>
"Please," Jonny D. said when he saw me, "lie down." 
</P>
<P>
I climbed aboard an "ultrafirm" water bed as Jonny D. explained how the water 
beds of today are not like the water beds of yesteryear. They all don't make 
you bounce like a dinghy in a windstorm. Now they come in "ultrafirm" and 
"firm" as well as "fullwave." 
</P>
<P>
"In 1968, John Hall invented the modern water bed as we know it," Jonny D. 
said. "Though Persians used to sleep on water-filled goatskins in the desert." 
</P>
<P>
Then he went to the far side of the bed I was lying on and pushed down on it 
hard. I barely bounced at all. "You could sleep with a partner and roll around 
and the partner would not be bothered at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
I thought of about 11 snappy comebacks but didn't use any of them. It didn't 
seem appropriate. Jonny D. does not use sex to sell water beds. That was the 
old days. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, some people ask about sex," Jonny D. said. "They will ask if a water bed 
is good for their sex life or bad for their sex life. I tell them no matter 
what bed they get, they'll enjoy themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of sex, Jonny D. stresses health and comfort. Which is why he urges 
people -- begs them! -- to climb right on the beds with their shoes on and 
everything. "You won't get seasick," he tells them. "You'll feel good." 
</P>
<P>
There were dozens of models in the store, from basic water beds to ones that 
look just like regular mattresses to "The Accolade," which is a canopied, 
four-poster water bed with mirrors above the mattress. (Sex still seems to be 
on some minds.) 
</P>
<P>
While we were talking, a woman came in wearing an Oakland Raiders jacket. She 
was looking for water-bed pillows and told me her name was Sarah Moore, she was 
24 and pregnant with her first child. "My husband surprised me with a water bed 
three years ago," she said with a laugh. "And I don't think I could ever go 
back to a regular bed." 
</P>
<P>
"Bless you," Jonny D. told her. 
</P>
<P>
I climbed on another bed, this one with a massage system. As I lay back, Jonny 
D. turned the dial from "tone" to "massage" to "pulse." The water moved. I 
closed my eyes and for some reason thought of Woodstock, Joan Baez and lost 
youth. 
</P>
<P>
Jonny D. gave me facts and figures. He filled my arms with pamphlets. Later, I 
checked the newspaper clippings and learned that in 1977, Newsweek reported 
that water beds were a $50-million-a-year industry. Today, the figure is about 
$2 billion a year and growing. 
</P>
<P>
One reason is that water beds have moved into the mainstream. "Everything novel 
I bought has been made ordinary by yuppies," Christopher S. Conquest, a teacher 
in Spring Lake, N.J., complained to the New York Times in 1986. "First it was 
sushi, then my Saab and now my water bed." 
</P>
<P>
The blackest day in water-bed history came in 1987 when Pope John Paul II came 
to Miami and stayed in the home of Archbishop Edward McCarthy. McCarthy offered 
the Pope his own bed, which happened to be a water bed. To avoid any jokes (can 
you imagine what Letterman could have done with it), papal authorities had the 
bed removed and replaced with a standard bed. 
</P>
<P>
And in 1985 in Clinton, Iowa, history was made. David Soibel opened up a 
combination delicatessen and water-bed store. "I felt it would tie together," 
he said. "Eating and sleeping." 
</P>
<P>
I asked Jonny D. what he liked best about his job. 
</P>
<P>
He thought for a moment. And then told me something that convinced me that, 
yes, he was a salesman pushing a product. But he was also something else. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it when newlyweds come in," he said. "Or people thinking about getting 
married. Because it's nice to see people in love. Shopping for their first 
bed." 
</P>
<P>
Jonny D., the last romantic in America.

THE COUSTEAU WATCH: ENVIRONMENTALIST PAYS WITH HIS LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN-MICHEL COUSTEAU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I got the message, my mind was not on murder. In the intense heat, 
humidity dripped down the windshield of the truck. In the dark night of the 
Brazilian Amazon, the words relayed by my friend were startling: "Tell Cousteau 
if he ever comes back here, he'll never get out alive." 
</P>
<P>
At first I thought I hadn't heard him correctly. But it was shockingly true. I 
had received a warning from the cocaine underworld -- an underworld eager to 
protect its coca fields in the Amazon. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, I had become a marked person because our expedition teams were 
making inquiries about the Amazon cocaine trade. At that moment, the reality I 
had been vaguely sensing for months pierced the curtain of jungle: The lawless 
want the Amazon, at any price. 
</P>
<P>
The threat to my life dissipated. But Francisco (Chico) Mendes Filho was not so 
fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
Mendes made his living tapping latex from trees. During his long career of 
environmental activism, he helped unionize rubber tappers and ranch hands in 
the wild Brazilian Amazon state of Acre and served on his local town council. 
</P>
<P>
He vehemently protested the clearing of dense Amazon forest, not only because 
deforestation meant the destruction of rubber trees and his livelihood, but 
also because he deeply cared about the future of the region. In 1987, he even 
traveled to Washington to try to persuade the Inter-American Bank to cancel a 
loan that would enable Brazil to pave a vast highway through the heart of 
virgin Acre jungle. According to a spokesman for the bank, he was instrumental 
in persuading the bank that indigenous Amazonian cultures and large areas of 
forest needed better protection. Thanks largely to the efforts of Mendes, the 
loan was held in abeyance until the bank could be satisfied that environmental 
concerns were being properly addressed. As of late February, 1989, the loan 
remained frozen. 
</P>
<P>
In working to restructure the loan, Mendes dreamed instead of international 
financing for projects that would wisely use the Amazon -- such as mass 
cultivation of medicinal plants, nuts and other native crops. 
</P>
<P>
By September, 1987, there had already been at least five threats on Chico 
Mendes' life. He was a particular nuisance to Amazon cattle ranchers, who 
clear-cut vast tracts of trees to graze cattle for beef to be exported, mostly 
to developed countries. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 22, 1988, lawlessness finally had its way. The 44-year-old Mendes was 
assassinated by a band of cattle ranchers whose operations he had long opposed. 
Several suspects were arrested, one rancher's son confessed to the shooting, 
and the search continues for others. 
</P>
<P>
But arrests alone would not close the case. As a friend in Brazil said: "Big 
people and big money killed Chico Mendes." 
</P>
<P>
As I traveled through the Amazon, I was always amazed at the grandeur of the 
countless rivers, always humbled by the vastness of the green sea of trees. I 
was always aware that in this primeval forest, in supposedly savage wilderness, 
a natural order prevailed. It is modern society that seems uncivilized, noisy 
and destructive. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, I too appreciate progress. It is indeed helpful to be able to call 
New York or Paris, or even Calypso from a direct-dial phone in a dusty 
Amazonian frontier town. Development can bring creature comforts to the wild. 
But in the Amazon, the lust for profit has brought wild development. 
</P>
<P>
Chico Mendes fought this Amazon fever. He tried to stop unbridled 
deforestation, but the stakes had climbed too high. He was murdered because he 
had become an international figure -- a hero to those who want to protect the 
resources of our planet -- and because his effectiveness was taking money out 
of pockets. 
</P>
<P>
His death was a terrifying reminder that those who stand in the way of the 
rapacious risk their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Others have been killed and many more intimidated for trying to stand in the 
way of the anarchy that modern man has brought to Amazonia. Had Mendes not 
crusaded publicly, his death would have gone unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
It will be shameful if environmentalism has to work "underground" to keep its 
leaders alive, if environmentalists have to wear hoods and go nameless lest 
they be shot and put out of the way; if anyone whose voice grows strong enough 
to be heard by the powerful has to go into hiding. 
</P>
<P>
When I heard of Chico Mendes' death, I felt it could have been me. Through his 
murder, I felt morally mobilized. Surely I am not alone. 
</P>
<P>
Mendes will be replaced and his movement will continue. An idea cannot be shot. 
The killers pulled the trigger on Chico Mendes, but greed and ignorance made 
the gun. Mendes clearly understood that we have only one Amazon forest, one 
water system, one habitable globe. So that his death shall not have been for 
nothing, his vision must remain ours.

DROWNING IN AMERICA, STARVING FOR CHINA; 
</P>
<P>
THE JOY LUCK CLUB BY AMY TAN (G.P. PUTNAM'S SONS: $18.95; 277 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Carolyn See, See's most recent novel is Golden Days (Fawcett). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The only negative thing I could ever say about this book is that I'll never 
again be able to read it for the first time. "The Joy Luck Club" is so 
powerful, so full of magic, that by the end of the second paragraph, your heart 
catches; by the end of the first page, tears blur your vision, and one-third of 
the way down on Page 26, you know you won't be doing anything of importance 
until you have finished this novel. 
</P>
<P>
The main narrative here is taken up by Jing-mei Woo, a first-generation 
American-Chinese woman whose whole tone is tuned to the fact that she is, 
essentially, lost. She's swimming upstream in American culture, doing the best 
she can, but she's gone through several jobs, she's gotten into the habit of 
settling for less than she should, and her own Chinese mother appears to be 
bitterly disappointed in her. Then, her mother dies, and Jing-mei is asked by 
three old family friends to take her mother's place at their mah-jongg table, 
at a social club they've been carrying on in San Francisco for the last 40 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Here is Jing-mei (who goes by the name of June, now), recording her first night 
as a bona-fide member: "The Joy Luck Aunties are all wearing slacks, bright 
print blouses, and different versions of sturdy walking shoes. We are all 
seated around the dining room table under a lamp that looks like a Spanish 
candelabra. Uncle George puts on his bifocals and starts the meeting by reading 
the minutes. 'Our capital account is $24,825, or about $6,206 a couple, $3,103 
a person. We sold Subaru for a loss at six and three quarters. We bought a 
hundred shares of Smith International at seven. Our thanks to Lindo and Tinn 
Jong for the goodies. The red bean soup was especially delicious. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
Not the stuff of high adventure. But the original Joy Luck Club was started in 
Chungking during the last of World War II by Jing-mei's mother when she was a 
young widow, literally setting herself and her friends the task of creating joy 
and luck out of unimaginable catastrophe: "What was worse, we asked among 
ourselves, to sit and wait for our own deaths with proper somber faces? or to 
choose our own happiness? . . . We decided to hold parties and pretend each 
week had become the new year. Each week we could forget past wrongs done to us. 
We weren't allowed to think a bad thought. We feasted, we laughed, we played 
games, lost and won, we told the best stories. And each week, we could hope to 
be lucky." 
</P>
<P>
The reason that the men in the present Joy Luck Club buy stock now is so that 
every member can feel lucky and have some joy, because by this time it has 
become unacceptable to lose anything more. The four women who have consoled 
themselves in America for 40 years with friendship, mah-jongg and stories, have 
already lived lives that are, again, unimaginable. On top of all their other 
terrors and adversities, their pasts have been lost; as if these horrors have 
taken place not just in another country but on another planet. Their deepest 
wish is to pass their knowledge, their tales, on to their children, especially 
to their daughters, but those young women are undergoing a slow death of their 
own; drowning in American culture at the same time they starve for a past they 
can never fully understand. 
</P>
<P>
The author leavens this Angst with Marx brothers humor, making you laugh, 
literally, even as you cry. What can you do with a Chinese couple who name 
their four boys Matthew, Mark, Luke and Bing? What can you tell a mother who 
thinks she's getting "so-so security" from the government, or (as Jing-mei 
remembers her own mother deep in indignation about an irate neighbor who 
believes that she's killed his cat) " ' . . . That man, he raise his hand like 
this, show me his ugly fist and call me worst Fukien landlady. I not from 
Fukien. Hunh! He know nothing!' " 
</P>
<P>
But the misunderstandings don't come merely from vagaries of language. "The Joy 
Luck Club" is about the way the past distances itself from the present as 
speedily as a disappearing star on a "Star Trek" rerun. It's gone, gone, and 
yet the past holds the only keys to meaning in every life examined here. On her 
first night at the mah-jongg table, her mother's friends revealed to Jing-mei 
that she has two half-sisters still in China, and that the Joy Luck ladies have 
saved money so that she, Jing-mei, can go home to tell them about their mother. 
" 'What can I tell them about my mother?' " Jing-mei blurts. " 'I don't know 
anything . . . .' " But the book is dedicated by the author: "To my mother and 
the memory of her mother. You asked me once what I would remember. This, and 
much more." What results from this stunningly devotional tour de force is an 
entrance into eight separate lives: four women whose "real" life occurred in 
China, in another world, in another mind; and four of their daughters, 
themselves grown women now. To say they are all products of conflicting value 
systems is heavy-handed inaccuracy, wimpy paraphrase. 
</P>
<P>
Here, for instance, is Eurasian Lena St. Clair, Ying-ying's daughter, 
translating her mother's Chinese to her Caucasian father, after Ying-ying has 
given birth to her stillborn baby brother: Lena's mother cries out " . . . Then 
this baby, maybe he heard us, his large head seemed to fill with hot air and 
rise up from the table. The head turned to one side. . . . It looked right 
through me. I knew he could see everything inside me. How I had given no 
thought to killing my other son!" Lena translates to her sad, ignorant father: 
" . . . She thinks we must all think very hard about having another baby. . . . 
And she thinks we should leave now and go have dinner.' " 
</P>
<P>
And, 15 or so years later, it seems inevitable that Lena should end up with a 
Hungarian "rice husband" (so named for all those Chinese "rice Christians" who 
hung around missionaries in China simply so they could get a square meal). In 
the name of feminism and right thinking, this husband is taking Lena for every 
cent she's got, but she's so demoralized, so "out of balance" in the Chinese 
sense, that she can't do a thing about it. 
</P>
<P>
If, so far, I haven't done justice to this book, that's because you can't turn 
a poem into prose, or explain magic, without destroying the magic, destroying 
the poem. One can only mention scraps: The four mothers come from different 
parts of (and times in) China, so for instance, the author allows us to see one 
peasant mother, Lindo Jong, who remembers she was not worthless: "I looked and 
smelled like a precious bun cake, sweet with a good clean color." Lindo, 
betrothed at 2, wangles her way out of a horrible marriage with courage and 
wit. But another mah-jongg lady, An-mei, has watched her own mother lose her 
honor and "face" by becoming third concubine to a hideous merchant in Tiensing. 
An-mei's mother times her suicide in such a way that her ghost can come back to 
haunt the house on New Year's Day, thus insuring a good future for her child, 
who, in turn, comes to America, has a daughter, Rose, who somehow rustles up 
the courage to defy an American husband who's trying to swindle her. . . . 
</P>
<P>
But the stories of the four mothers, the four daughters, are not really the 
point here. "The Joy Luck Club" is dazzling because of the worlds it gives us: 
When Lindo, old now, says, " 'Feel my bracelets. They must be 24 carats, pure 
inside and out,' " if you have any sense at all, you let yourself be led down a 
garden path into a whole other place; where a little girl in San Francisco 
becomes chess champion at age 6 by using her mother's "invisible strength," 
where a woman who comes from the richest family in Wushi (with boxes of jade in 
every room holding just the right amount of cigarettes) is given the name of 
Betty by her dopey American husband, who doesn't know she's already "dead," a 
"ghost. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
At the perimeters of all these stories are all the men, buying and trading in 
this Mountain of Gold, selling Subaru at a loss, each one of them with his own 
story that has yet to be told. "The Joy Luck Club" has the disconcerting effect 
of making you look at everyone in your own life with the -- however fleeting -- 
knowledge that they are locked in the spaceships of their own amazing stories. 
Only magicians of language like Amy Tan hold the imaginative keys to the 
isolating capsules. Which is why we have novels and novelists in the first 
place.

TWO KINDS OF ENGLISH RESISTANCE; 
</P>
<P>
EDMUND BURKE HIS LIFE AND OPINIONS BY STANLEY AYLING (ST. MARTIN'S PRESS: 
$19.95; 306 PP., ILLUSTRATED)

1989 marks the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution. Coming at the end of 
a century of French intellectual leadership and followed by an attempt, 
temporarily successful, to make Europe a French empire, the Revolution well 
deserves the torrent of books that will be devoted to it this year. Two of the 
first of these books deal with the resistance to the Revolution: Edmund Burke, 
right, in the intellectual resistance, challenging the political philosophy of 
the Revolution; Horatio, Viscount Nelson in the military resistance, blocking 
the advance of Napoleon. 
</P>
<P>
Conservatism, like so many of the labels of modern politics, acquired its 
meaning through the French Revolution. The Bicentennial of the Revolution makes 
it timely to have a new biography of Edmund Burke, perhaps the Revolution's 
most enduringly persuasive opponent. In "Reflections on the Revolution in 
France, " published in 1790 when he was 62, Burke developed his principled 
opposition to large-scale change, especially when directed by intellectuals 
armed with comprehensive social theories, which has come to define much 
Anglo-American conservatism. 
</P>
<P>
Burke also advocated hereditary nobility, and an established church. He 
preferred "prejudice," tradition and usage over rights and principles. Yet his 
political affiliations were not with the Tories but the Whigs, a party that 
believed in commerce and progress in "manners." His own century regarded him 
chiefly as the author of a quintessential tract of Enlightenment science, 
"Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and the Beautiful," in which the 
29-year-old Burke applied the new mechanical psychology to the experience of 
art. The diversity, if not clashing inconsistency, all this presents to the 
modern mind suggests the enigma of Burke's genius. Yet if we are to come to 
grips with modern conservatism it is vital that we see this giant of 
18th-Century British letters and politics steadily, and at least try to see him 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Ayling's crisp narrative of Burke's life provides a good sense of 
Burke's diversity and how it was intertwined with the turns of his career. 
Ayling is the first biographer of Burke to have had access to the complete 
extant correspondence, and he uses this source well to connect the private with 
the public person. Ayling brings to Burke's milieu the sensitivities honed by 
his well-received biographies of King George III and John Wesley. He presents 
Burke's life as a sometimes noble, often quixotic, drama of heroism which ended 
in private sorrow, particularly the early death of his beloved son and heir, 
amid the general failure of all his public efforts. Burke's own phrase, "an 
Iliad of woe," seems to capture his sense of himself and career at the end. 
Ayling shows us that the man Mathew Arnold called "our greatest prose-writer" 
lived his politics passionately: "He was incapable of private peace and 
contentment if the nation -- 'the empire' -- was in crisis. It is significant 
that Burke thought his nation was often "in crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Burke's political life was largely spent attempting to reform the British 
Constitution -- so as to restore what he conceived as its ancient purity. This 
propelled him to champion the grievances of the American Colonies, to support 
both Anglican Establishment and religious toleration, and to oppose colonial 
oppression in both Ireland and India. 
</P>
<P>
The key to grasping how it all hung together certainly lies in the interplay 
between Burke's situation as an Anglo-Irish outsider who became indispensable 
to a branch of the Whig aristocracy and his lifelong passion for rectifying -- 
rather than leveling -- the hierarchies of social and moral order. But here the 
book disappoints. Ayling enables us to see the workings of the society which 
was the matrix of Burke's life and thought. He does not succeed in making us 
understand that context. With a thinker as significant and as complex as Burke, 
this is an important shortcoming. 
</P>
<P>
Ayling allows us to see how Burke made himself the advocate of that peculiar 
marriage of landed stability and commercial progress which called itself the 
Whig party. However, he seems to presuppose that the reader will find the very 
uncontemporary patterns of the social and intellectual order of Whig England an 
obvious frame of reference. For most readers, however, it will not be obvious 
but strange, as the past is always strange. The need is not to eliminate the 
strangeness but to make it comprehensible so that the unmodern conjunctions in 
Burke's thinking may become comprehensible as well. 
</P>
<P>
An admirer of Montesquieu, Burke thought that vanished social order he called 
the British Constitution to be a coherent whole: hierarchical and sacred, yet 
simultaneously commercial and dynamic. It is a conception no longer alive, but 
the survival of its disjoined members in modern conservatism (and not only 
there) indicates how important -- but also how difficult -- it is to try to 
comprehend what Burke was so passionate about. 
</P>
<P>
Ayling has given us an engaging tapestry of the significant patterns of Burke's 
achievement. The need now is to understand how Burke sought to make it all 
cohere, and then to show why it is significant for us that he tried to do so.

TWO KINDS OF ENGLISH RESISTANCE;

LORD NELSON THE IMMORTAL MEMORY BY DAVID HOWARTH AND STEPHEN HOWARTH (VIKING:

1989 marks the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution. Coming at the end of 
a century of French intellectual leadership and followed by an attempt, 
temporarily successful, to make Europe a French empire, the Revolution well 
deserves the torrent of books that will be devoted to it this year. Two of the 
first of these books deal with the resistance to the Revolution: Edmund Burke, 
right, in the intellectual resistance, challenging the political philosophy of 
the Revolution; Horatio, Viscount Nelson in the military resistance, blocking 
the advance of Napoleon. 
</P>
<P>
In London, Horatio, Viscount Nelson's Column stands proud as any memorial to 
Washington or Lincoln. His ship is enshrined and Sir Francis Drake's wasn't. 
His brilliant tactics and foolish acts have become public domain through a 
dozen biographies, eight volumes of letters and dispatches -- every form of 
public record, in fact, save a "Masterpiece Theatre" miniseries. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, clearly, bequeathed himself to Britain and there should be little left 
to say. 
</P>
<P>
David and Stephen Howarth have produced a detailed, balanced chronology. It is 
studious, readable and clean of emotional partialities. Their fascination is 
Nelson and the creation of an icon, his toughness and frailties, not the 
win-loss stats of one admiral and the pedantics of his wars at sea. 
</P>
<P>
A reader is ever aware, and thankful for that direction and the authors' joint 
standing and understanding as military historians. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it remains just another book about Nelson that recycles the household and 
schoolboy lore (at least among schoolboys in British households) of the Royal 
Navy's wooden-walled glories and one officer's spanking victories at Cape St. 
Vincent, the Battle of the Nile, and, in 1805, the Battle of Trafalgar. 
</P>
<P>
Here's Nelson, one-eyed, one-armed, deserting his wife for a blatant and 
international affair with married Lady Emma Hamilton. There's Nelson, during 
one sea battle, placing a spyglass to his sightless eye and not seeing his 
commander's recall flags. And Horatio Nelson, the split personality; an 
insecure popinjay seduced by his own decorations and fame -- yet a confident, 
respected iron hero at sea. 
</P>
<P>
And exactly as much of it was reported (less the slap and tickle and 
psychological interpretations) by Robert Southey in "The Life of Nelson" as 
early as 1813. 
</P>
<P>
The longevity and intensity of this public reverence for Lord Nelson is not 
lost on the Howarths. 
</P>
<P>
"No one and nothing can be remembered literally for ever," they note. "Nelson 
is an unusually hard person to forget, or even to want to forget. The reasons 
for remembering him have changed often with time, fashion and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea of Nelson as martyr entered into it very quickly and grew to 
Christ-like proportions . . . dying not only for his country but for its 
salvation. Even in his lifetime, he was regarded by many as a national guardian 
angel . . . and afterwards he became virtually a secular patron saint. 
</P>
<P>
"Although some people felt Emma's claim that during battle, he would cry out: 
'For Emma and England' was going a bit far." 
</P>
<P>
It certainly was. On the other hand, the truths of Nelson's life were equal to 
any apocrypha. By all standards of any era, he was one of the greatest heroes 
and military leaders the world has ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
He went to sea at age 12. He was a lieutenant at 18 and a captain in command of 
an armed schooner at 20. Two years later he was in combat and had he lived in 
our time and served this country, Nelson would have been the recipient of at 
least the Medal of Honor, certainly the Distinguished Service Cross, and 
definitely four Purple Hearts. 
</P>
<P>
Although slight and short, Nelson was tough enough to fight continual sea 
sickness, recurring malaria and an endless variety of paralyzing plagues and 
fevers. Emotionally, he was very much the lesser man who fell for anything in 
crinolines and was besotted by Lady Hamilton, the promiscuous apogee of 
Nelson's vanity, arrogance and mid-life crisis. 
</P>
<P>
And like George S. Patton Jr. he sensed a mystic guidance to his military 
service. Patton believed he was the reincarnation of a commander of Roman 
legions. Nelson, as a 17-year-old sailor, saw a "brilliant orb." 
</P>
<P>
He half-believed it a light from heaven and fully believed the sudden vision as 
"A glow of patriotism . . . (that) presented my king and country as my patron. 
My mind exulted in the idea. Well then, I exclaimed. I will be a hero! And 
confiding in Providence, I will brave every danger." 
</P>
<P>
Thirty years later, while routing Napoleon's navy at Trafalgar, while setting 
an end to war at sea for more than a century, he was hit in the chest by a 
French musket ball and died below decks on his flagship "Victory." 
</P>
<P>
At 47, he died in the arms of his officers and surrounded by his wounded men. 
There was national and individual devastation sufficient to overshadow 
England's final victory against the French. 
</P>
<P>
A senior captain wrote to his wife: "On such terms it was a victory I never 
wished to have witnessed." 
</P>
<P>
A gundeck sailor wrote home in pencil and said it much better: "Our dear 
Admiral Nelson is killed . . . chaps that fought like the devil sit down and 
cry like a wench." 
</P>
<P>
Shiver my timbers, Alistair, what stuff for a "Masterpiece Theatre" miniseries.

SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS MEMOIRS BY JOHN UPDIKE (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $18.95; 256 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When John Updike revisited his childhood hometown of Shillington, Penn., he 
walked the streets one night in a misty rain. Everything spoke to him in its 
survival, or more commonly, in its replacement by something else. There was the 
luncheonette, the movie theater, the school. 
</P>
<P>
Only his old house was mute. It seemed blunt and unrevealing. "Its familiar 
face and I had little to say to each other." 
</P>
<P>
Little to say. Perhaps it was inevitable that when Updike came to try his hand 
at autobiographical sketching, after so much fictionalizing of his life, he 
would offer a candid judgment on the effort. Aside from being a distinguished 
novelist and the correspondence secretary of America's college class of 1954, 
he is a shrewd and fair-minded reviewer. 
</P>
<P>
Here and there through these sketches, he puts up flags of discouragement. 
"These memoirs feel shabby," he writes. Memory is like the wishing-skin in 
fairy tales, with its limited number of wishes. His, he writes, has been "used 
up and wished away in the self-serving corruption of fiction." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, what a memoir most requires is not memory. It is hunger. Updike seems 
sated. He was moved to write, he tells us, after hearing that a would-be 
biographer was on his trail seeking "to take my life, my lode of ore, my heap 
of memories from me." "Self-Consciousness" -- surely the least hungry title a 
memoir ever had -- is an exercise in preemptive autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
It will not work. Updike means too much to us to be left alone. Sooner or 
later, some biographer's passion will override the memorialist's weariness. 
</P>
<P>
A memoir seeks to rediscover what its author has lost. It has the urgency of a 
quest. Updike knows what he will find; he has found it before. He writes to 
confirm his sensibility, not to extend it. 
</P>
<P>
And a memoir is a journey, with the surprises and dangers of one. Updike sits 
and unpacks. Lacking a journey to go on, the reader sits and watches him 
unpack. 
</P>
<P>
We sense inertness is evident from the start. The first of the sketches, and 
one of the best, is Updike's nighttime ramble through Shillington. But he 
doesn't simply go there; instead, he arrives by a decidedly mannered set of 
coincidences. 
</P>
<P>
He and his daughter were to stay with his mother 13 miles away. But his 
daughter failed to tip the airline porter properly, the luggage didn't arrive, 
daughter and mother wanted to come into Shillington to see a movie. Instead of 
staying behind to wait for the luggage to be delivered, Updike arranges for an 
airline representative to drop his suitcase in front of the movie theater. He 
will wait outside. And this gives him time to walk around. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Such indirection -- the self-consciousness of the title -- bestows an air of 
lassitude even when the recollection is vivid and touching. 
</P>
<P>
Updike recalls the feeling of well-being he used to get at the local department 
store, as if God were a "manufacturer -- god," a guarantor of plenty. 
</P>
<P>
He recalls hearing two teachers talking quietly, perhaps romantically, one 
afternoon when he stayed late at school to work on a project. For the first 
time, he realized that these grown-ups had purposes other than to educate him. 
</P>
<P>
He retells the quiet turbulences of his home. Both father and mother were in 
some sense disappointed people. The material lacks the strength it had in his 
novel, "The Centaur." Still, looking down Philadelphia Avenue, Updike gives us 
one of his radiant slow lines: 
</P>
<P>
"I loved this plain street where for 13 years no great harm had been allowed to 
befall me." 
</P>
<P>
One of the sketches goes into detail about Updike's lifelong skin affliction. 
We hear too much about it. But the piece has more energy than the others, and 
it finds an equivalence between his struggle to resist his own nature -- 
"psoriasis was my health," -- and a writer's self-invention. 
</P>
<P>
Similar equivalences are attempted in "Getting the Words Out." But the 
connections are overrun. The author tells us in detail about his asthma and his 
sense of being choked by his first marriage and four children. He goes on to 
recount the stuttering that accompanied his guilt when he left them after 17 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Nine gruesome pages of dental surgery crown a ragbag chapter. It goes from his 
non-dovishness during Vietnam -- he identified with the blue-collars against 
the snobs -- to furtive sex with neighbors' wives, to the contrast between his 
own Lutheran "heaviness" and the "airiness" of his wife's Unitarian family. 
</P>
<P>
The book's flickering impulse grows fainter as it goes along. With "A Letter to 
My Grandsons," it is extinguished entirely. It is 47 pages of Updikes and Op 
Den Dyks, going back to the 16th Century; nothing but genealogy real and 
surmised, and relieved only by some thoughts about how the grandchildren, whose 
father is Ghanaian, will find life as half-blacks in America. 
</P>
<P>
Updike makes it evident that he is not happy with his book. Perhaps this 
unhappiness is its real subject. It is a confession of a sort, though an 
incomplete one. 
</P>
<P>
A confession is not just telling; it is also a search for an absolution -- from 
God, the reader, the past or the future. Updike isn't looking for one. Perhaps, 
after so much ministry and absolution-work among the characters he has created, 
he can't believe in one.

VINCENNES SKIPPER'S WIFE ESCAPES BOMB IN SAN DIEGO

<P>
A pipe bomb Friday destroyed a van driven by the wife of the captain of the 
cruiser Vincennes, which mistakenly shot down an Iranian airliner last year. 
Authorities suspect it was a terrorist attack. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Rogers, 50, escaped just seconds before the van burst into flames. 
</P>
<P>
A Justice Department source in Washington who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said investigators suspect that the bombing was the work of terrorists. The FBI 
said it had not ruled out anything. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Rogers was uninjured and was taken to a police station, where she was 
joined by her husband, Capt. Will Rogers III. Rogers was home at the time of 
the blast. Authorities placed the family under protection. Their son was away 
at college and was notified. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Rogers, a schoolteacher, was driving alone to school and was stopped at a 
red light when the bomb exploded at 7:45 a.m. She jumped out as fire quickly 
gutted the van. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers was in charge of the San Diego-based Vincennes in July when the 
guided-missile cruiser, on duty in the Persian Gulf, mistakenly shot down a 
civilian Iran Air Airbus A300 carrying 290 people. Everyone aboard was killed. 
</P>
<P>
No one claimed responsibility for the car bombing. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no motive at this point in time -- certainly, we have no suspects," 
Tom Hughes, special agent in charge of the local FBI office, told a press 
conference. "We certainly do not rule out the potential retribution to Capt. 
Rogers for his . . . command in the Navy." 
</P>
<P>
The explosive was attached to the white Toyota van's undercarriage, said San 
Diego Police Department spokesman Bill Robinson. Fire department officials 
agreed. "The device that was thought to be a pipe bomb was confirmed," Robinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the FBI was not prepared to confirm the type of explosive device, 
the type of explosive material used or how it was detonated, Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
A message from Rogers was relayed by Cmdr. David Dillon, spokesman for the 
Naval Surface Force Pacific Fleet, to which the Vincennes is assigned. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked with Capt. Rogers and Mrs. Rogers this morning at the police station. 
They wanted to pass on that Mrs. Rogers was fine and in good shape." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about Rogers' reaction to the bombing, Dillon said, "I think he's just 
exasperated by the whole thing. Obviously he's concerned about what happened to 
his wife. They just want to get on to other things." 
</P>
<P>
The Rogerses were being taken to a secret secure place where they will stay 
indefinitely, Dillon said. Their son also was under protection. 
</P>
<P>
Dillon said he did not believe any other Vincennes crewmen were being 
protected. But the Navy increased its security at the San Diego Navy Base and 
other facilities, Navy Chief Craig Huebler said. Other Vincennes crew members 
and their families were notified. 
</P>
<P>
The Vincennes returned from its six-month Persian Gulf deployment last October. 
It remains in port and Rogers remains its skipper. 
</P>
<P>
As the Vincennes exchanged fire with Iranian speedboats last July 3, Iran Air 
Flight 655 appeared on the U.S. warship's high-tech radar. After the plane 
failed to respond to warnings on civilian and military channels, Rogers gave 
the order to fire. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Compensation for Victims 
</P>
<P>
The decision, he said later, was in defense of his ship and crew. But what 
Rogers feared was an Iranian F-14 fighter actually was the Airbus A300. The 
Reagan Administration defended the decision but also decided to compensate the 
victims' families. 
</P>
<P>
After the shooting, Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called for an all-out 
war against the United States. Speculation after the destruction of a Pan Am 
jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December has focused on whether that 
bombing was in retaliation for the Vincennes' action. (Immediately after the 
plane crashed, a group claimed responsibility. But its claims were discounted 
at first.) 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Navy officials at the Pentagon said they were unaware of any 
threats against Rogers or his family, but were awaiting additional reports from 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eyewitness Account 
</P>
<P>
Construction worker Kurt Lent said he heard what sounded like a pair of 
backfires, with a 10-second interval, then a loud blast. 
</P>
<P>
"It went 'Boom!' 'Boom!' then 'Bam!"' he said. "It worked real quick." 
</P>
<P>
Seeing that Mrs. Rogers had escaped the van, Lent ran to the flaming vehicle to 
make sure that no one else was inside. He and fellow workers directed traffic 
while their supervisor escorted her to a pickup. 
</P>
<P>
"She was shaken up, obviously," said Lew Davis, another worker. 
</P>
<P>
Police sealed off the area, and the FBI took over the investigation from local 
authorities. Naval Investigative Service officials also were called in.

BUSH CHOOSES CHENEY FOR DEFENSE; 
</P>
<P>
WYOMING CONGRESSMAN PICKED AFTER REJECTION OF TOWER

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush on Friday named Rep. Dick Cheney of Wyoming as defense 
secretary, moving with surprising speed to leave behind the controversy caused 
by John Tower's rejection by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Senate Armed Services Committee quickly issued a statement 
praising Cheney and said confirmation hearings would begin this week. 
</P>
<P>
Bush hailed Cheney as a "widely respected man of principle" and dismissed the 
Tower saga by saying, "Look, that's history." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he expected that Cheney would win confirmation "very fast." 
</P>
<P>
Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole quickly hailed the appointment in a barbed 
comment that reflected the bitterness lingering from the Tower confirmation 
struggle. 
</P>
<P>
"He's tough. That's what we wanted. A tough, tough, tough guy," Dole said of 
Cheney. "This time it will be a confirmation, not an execution." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, 48, is a sixth-term conservative congressman from Wyoming who served as 
White House chief of staff in the Ford Administration in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously things have moved very quickly in the last 24 hours," Cheney said in 
referring to Bush's swift, overnight search for a replacement candidate for 
Tower. "I did agonize. It was not an easy decision." 
</P>
<P>
Tower's nomination was killed on Thursday on a near party-line vote of 53 to 47 
in the Democratic-controlled Senate. He was defeated by concerns over his 
drinking habits, his relationships with women and his work as a paid defense 
industry consultant after leaving government service. 
</P>
<P>
Bush repeated his earlier accusations that Tower had been unfairly treated 
during his losing campaign for confirmation, but expressed an eagerness not to 
dwell on the rejection. He said Democratic leaders in the Senate "had given 
their word to me and that means a lot" that they were willing to cooperate with 
the new Administration. 
</P>
<P>
But even as Bush reached out, Vice President Dan Quayle turned up the heat and 
accused Senate Democrats of engaging in "a McCarthyite mud-slinging campaign" 
against Tower and waging an "assault on the powers of the presi dency." 
</P>
<P>
Bush turned aside questions about Quayle's remarks by saying he hadn't read 
them. "So I can't tell you whether he speaks for me. I speak for myself. He 
speaks for himself." 
</P>
<P>
Bush thus moved to put the Tower defeat behind him swiftly -- and if the speed 
was a surprise, so was the selection. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney's name had not figured in any of the speculation that arose in the hours 
after Tower's rejection. 
</P>
<P>
But his nomination quickly drew praise from the Senate, which will vote on his 
confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Tim Wirth (D-Colo.) said, "He's a very able and impressive person. . . . 
He's one of the smartest people in Congress." 
</P>
<P>
"An excellent choice," said Sen. Charles S. Robb, the freshman from Virginia 
who was one of the last Democrats to announce his opposition to Tower. 
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued by Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), the Senate Armed Services 
Committee chairman, and Sen. John Warner of Virginia, the committee's ranking 
Republican, the senators said Cheney "is well-known and highly respected by the 
members of the Senate. We have worked with him on many issues involving 
national defense and intelligence matters." 
</P>
<P>
The senators said hearings will begin this week and the committee's work will 
be completed "as expeditiously as possible consistent with the President and 
the nominee providing the requisite background and financial material and 
consistent with thoroughness and fairness." 
</P>
<P>
In response to reporters' questions on the Strategic Defense Initiative and a 
series of other defense issues, Cheney said, "I have extensive views on defense 
policy but I don't believe I'll share them today." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Best, Proper Choice' 
</P>
<P>
Bush was asked about his past declarations that Tower was the best qualified 
candidate to head the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
"I said that on December whatever it was, and now we're in March whatever it 
is. And as of today Dick Cheney is the best and proper choice," the President 
said in an appearance before reporters shortly after his departure for a 
weekend at Camp David. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said he was "honored to be asked by the President to join his 
Administration." He said his first contact from the Administration came 
Thursday afternoon, presumably shortly after Tower's nomination was scuttled by 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said he underwent heart bypass surgery last August, but returned to work 
three weeks later. He said he had checked with his doctor before accepting 
Bush's offer of the appointment, and was assured that his health posed no 
barrier. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Candidates 
</P>
<P>
Many potential candidates were mentioned for the job, including former Rep. 
Jack Edwards (R-Ala.); Sens. William Cohen (R-Maine) and Ted Stevens 
(R-Alaska); former defense secretaries Donald Rumsfeld and James Schlesinger; 
former CIA deputy director Bobby Inman; Paul O'Neill, chairman and chief 
executive officer of Alcoa, and Norman Augustine, chairman and chief executive 
officer of Martin Marietta Corp., an aerospace firm. 
</P>
<P>
Marlin Fitzwater, at a late-morning briefing, said Bush reviewed candidates 
from "any number of people and sources in the government, in the White House 
and outside the government as well." 
</P>
<P>
Bush went through the same drill before choosing Tower last December. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Quayle flew to Indianapolis and, in a speech, harshly criticized 
Senate Democrats and warned that there will be a lingering bitterness over the 
Tower fight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Feeling of Outrage' 
</P>
<P>
"Never in all my years in the Senate have I encountered anything like the 
feeling of outrage that exists today among my former Republican Senate 
colleagues," he said. "Never have I encountered such anger and bitterness in 
the Senate chamber." 
</P>
<P>
Quayle said "the harmful consequences of the Tower affair will not soon pass. 
I'm afraid that the misguided Democratic assault on the powers of the 
presidency will continue."

MCFARLANE: REAGAN ASKED FOR SECRECY; 
</P>
<P>
HID CONTRA FUNDING FROM CONGRESS, HE TESTIFIES AT NORTH TRIAL

Former President Ronald Reagan, approving the solicitation of U.S. allies in 
1984 for aid to Nicaragua's Contras, directed that the project be kept secret 
from the American public and Congress, former National Security Adviser Robert 
C. McFarlane testified Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, McFarlane quoted Reagan, "we'll all be hanging by our thumbs in 
front of the White House." 
</P>
<P>
Appearing as the prosecution's star witness in the trial of former White House 
aide Oliver L. North, McFarlane expressed his own doubts about the legality of 
the operation in which he and North took part. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Possible Impeachment 
</P>
<P>
McFarlane disclosed that James A. Baker III, then the White House chief of 
staff and now secretary of state, suggested to Reagan that he could be 
impeached for allowing the solicitation of allies for aid for the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
But others in Reagan's inner circle -- including then-Vice President George 
Bush -- unanimously concluded that Baker was wrong. They said that outside aid 
could be sought, despite a congressional prohibition against direct or indirect 
U.S. military assistance for Nicaraguan guerrilla forces, McFarlane said. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing an almost perpetual frown and with his jaw thrust forward, McFarlane 
emphatically stated in nearly four hours of testimony that Reagan never told 
anyone to lie to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
McFarlane, 51, a former presidential aide who pleaded guilty last year to 
misleading Congress about White House assistance to the Contras and who was 
sentenced a week ago to two years of probation and a $20,000 fine, was the 
first witness at North's trial to testify about deliberations at the highest 
levels of the Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
McFarlane, near the start of his testimony, which will resume Monday, was asked 
by associate independent counsel John W. Keker, North's chief prosecutor: 
"After committing these crimes, did you try to commit suicide?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," McFarlane said, his face reddening in reference to a drug overdose he 
took at home in February, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Asked About Lying 
</P>
<P>
Later, in asking about Reagan's instructions to his staff, Keker said to 
McFarlane: "Did you ever hear Ronald Reagan say: 'We should lie to the Congress 
of the United States?' " 
</P>
<P>
"No," McFarlane replied firmly. 
</P>
<P>
"About anything?" Keker pursued. 
</P>
<P>
"No," McFarlane repeated. 
</P>
<P>
The principal charges among 12 felony counts on which North is being tried 
accuse the retired Marine lieutenant colonel of giving false statements to 
Congress and obstructing congressional inquiries by denying in 1985 and 1986 
that he was aiding the Contras with military advice or with money from private 
donors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Policy Decision 
</P>
<P>
North's attorneys have said they will show that the former National Security 
Council aide, who worked under McFarlane, was instructed by superiors to 
conceal his activities from Congress as part of a policy decision. 
</P>
<P>
Elaborating on his brief answers to Keker, McFarlane testified that Reagan 
"never said: 'Lie to Congress.' " 
</P>
<P>
Referring to aid solicitations from allies, Reagan "just said: 'Do not share 
that information with the Congress,' " McFarlane said, acknowledging that the 
House and Senate intelligence committees normally have access to any classified 
information in government. 
</P>
<P>
Once the top staff official of the NSC, McFarlane was asked by Keker -- with 
the help of documents -- to describe a meeting of the NSC on June 25, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Baker View 
</P>
<P>
"I recall Mr. Baker believed that if the President were to authorize procuring 
money from third countries that that would be a violation of law and the 
President could be so charged and impeached . . . removed from office," 
McFarlane testified. 
</P>
<P>
But he said Baker's statement was "strongly countered" by others at the 
meeting, including Bush, "and the conclusion was reached that it was not true." 
</P>
<P>
NSC officials feared that if members of Congress learned of third-country 
solicitations, they might be reluctant to restore U.S. aid for the Nicaraguan 
resistance movement, McFarlane said. 
</P>
<P>
When asked what instructions he had given North and other staff members in 
1984, McFarlane said he repeated Reagan's wishes that "we were to do all we 
could to keep the Contras alive and functioning until we could win a vote of 
the Congress," which eventually came in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Activities 
</P>
<P>
He said he never personally knew of activities to which previous witnesses at 
the trial have testified: that North was deeply involved in fund-raising for 
the Contras from wealthy U.S. citizens, that North conducted numerous 
conferences with Contra leaders to give them military advice and that North 
directed a covert weapons-purchasing and resupply effort for the rebel forces. 
</P>
<P>
McFarlane acknowledged receiving reports from North about Contra activities, 
but he said he simply assumed that North, like others in the U.S. intelligence 
community, had his own information sources. "Perhaps I was derelict in my 
duties," he said, asserting that "it didn't occur to me" that North was deeply 
involved in operations. 
</P>
<P>
But McFarlane said that on one occasion he asked North to find out the number 
of a foreign bank account maintained by the Contras after "the ambassador of a 
Middle Eastern country" (identified in 1987 congressional hearings as Saudi 
Arabia) volunteered to provide $1 million a month as a good-will gesture to the 
Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Private Meeting 
</P>
<P>
He said that Reagan later had a private White House meeting with "the head of 
state of that country" (identified by Congress as King Fahd) and that the 
nation increased its donation to $2 million a month. At least $24 million of 
that money had flowed to the Contras by mid-1985, McFarlane testified. 
</P>
<P>
In that year, he said, White House officials discussed the possibility of 
getting U.S. charities to provide food and medicine for the Contras and Reagan 
suggested forming a tax-exempt foundation to collect private money for weapons 
and military equipment. McFarlane, in response to a question, noted that Reagan 
is not a tax lawyer.

Nearly 200 chanting and singing anti-abortion demonstrators, part of a 
nationwide coalition known as Operation Rescue, were arrested outside 
California abortion clinics in Oakland, Fresno and Chico. About 100 people were 
seized in Fresno, with more than 80 arrested at the Feminist Women's Health 
Center in Chico and seven arrests were reported at the Oakland clinic. There 
were also demonstrations at two Sacramento abortion clinics but no arrests were 
reported. Police also arrested about 150 members of Operation Rescue in 
Pittsburgh, Pa., and 125 in Milwaukee for blocking entrances to abortion 
clinics. Protests reportedly were building toward major nationwide 
anti-abortion demonstrations planned for Easter weekend, with Los Angeles a key 
target.

President Bush continues to enjoy a large measure of public confidence. In a 
recent Gallup Poll, more than six in 10 (63%) approve of Bush's performance in 
office, while only 13% disapprove and 24% are undecided -- similar to the job 
ratings given Bush's predecessors at comparable points in their tenure. In 
Gallup's first assessment in late January, 51% approved and 6% disapproved of 
Bush's job performance, with 43% undecided. Refuting criticism of the White 
House as lacking a clear sense of purpose, Americans of all political stripes 
commend Bush for the job he has done in communicating his policies and agenda. 
And, although the public opposed Senate confirmation of former Sen. John Tower 
as secretary of defense, a solid majority (55%) approves of Bush's Cabinet 
appointments in general.

A veteran Oakland police homicide investigator said he has seen the local 
murder rate escalate sharply for a week or two before, but never like in 
February, when 22 people died at the hands of others. Sgt. Jerry Medsker, on 
the homicide detail for eight years, said he has "never seen a pace like this. 
I've seen a week or two go like that, but never a two-month period." Since the 
beginning of the year, Oakland has had 33 homicides, or one every 1.8 days. Of 
the total, 24 have been classified as drug-related.

The Palestinian uprising cost Israel $666 million in 1988 and nearly wiped out 
its economic growth, and it may exact a similar toll this year, a Cabinet 
minister was quoted as saying. Gad Yaacobi blamed the losses on higher military 
spending, reduced production, lost tourism and a fall-off in foreign 
investment. Yaacobi, of the left-leaning Labor Party, was economics minister 
until November, when he became communications minister. Israel Radio quoted 
Yaacobi as saying that Israel's $35-billion economy grew 1% last year instead 
of a forecasted 2.5%. In 1987, it grew 5%. An aide to Yaacobi said the minister 
believed the 1988 pattern could be repeated next year.

The U.S. Treasury lost more than $8 billion because of the frenzy of 
taxpayer-subsidized thrift bailouts ordered last year by federal regulators, 
the U.S. controller general said in testimony in San Antonio. "It's clear from 
our analysis that many of the deals should never have seen the light of day," 
Charles A. Bowsher said at a field hearing of the House Banking Committee into 
the nation's savings and loan crisis. "The taxpayers would have been better 
served if the institutions had been liquidated instead of rescued." A 
preliminary report by the General Accounting Office, an investigative agency of 
Congress, said new investors in failed thrifts often put up far less cash than 
they received in tax benefits. But the thrift insurance fund was bankrupt, 
Bowsher said, and regulators had no choice but to make deals that did not 
require huge pay-outs to depositors. The government accepted bad loans on the 
portfolio and made guarantees against future losses, he said.

One of the last survivors of Oakland's notorious drug wars, 34-year-old Sonnie 
Davis, has been convicted in federal court of conspiring to traffic in heroin 
and of obstructing justice. He faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. 
Convicted with Davis was his nephew, Ken Davis, 27. Both men were tried in U.S. 
District Court under a federal program designed to enhance penalties against 
major drug dealers. They will be sentenced May 24. Alameda County Assistant 
Dist. Atty. Russ Giuntini, the appointed prosecutor in the case, said Davis' 
drug-dealing career spanned shoot-outs with rivals going back to the 1970s. 
Giuntini said that while in jail, Davis ordered the murder of a woman he feared 
would testify against him.

Unseasonably balmy weather lingered in the nation's midsection, setting several 
record highs for the day, including a reading of 89 degrees in Amarillo, Tex., 
that shattered the 1972 mark of 83, the National Weather Service reported. 
Lubbock recorded 87 degrees, breaking the 1967 record of 86; Cheyenne, Wyo., 
had 71, breaking the 1900 record of 69; and Pueblo, Colo., had 82, breaking the 
1972 record of 81. Warm temperatures continued to melt the snow cover in the 
Midwest, bringing flooding to the Big Muddy River at Murphysboro, Ill. In 
Hooper, Neb., an ice jam caused local flooding. Other rivers and streams 
covered by flood warnings included the Pecatonica River in southwest Wisconsin, 
the Weiser River near Weiser, Ida., the John Day River at Service Creek, Ore., 
and the Umitilla River at Pendleton, Ore.

Three Japanese men who set out to climb Mt. McKinley are presumed to have died 
about 3,000 feet below the summit, National Park Service rangers in Alaska 
said. "I'm afraid I see no hope for their survival," ranger Bob Seibert said as 
he called off the rescue effort. Searchers who flew over part of the 
20,320-foot peak reported seeing three objects, perhaps the bodies, at the 
17,400-foot level above the party's camp, but weather conditions prevented 
identification. Noboru Yamada, 39, Teruo Saegusa, 31, and Kozo Komatsu, 34, all 
of Tokyo, began their expedition Feb. 16. Rangers said they feared the men were 
blown off an 800-foot drop in Denali Pass, an area known for ferocious winds.

A new federal indictment leveled additional charges against former Philippine 
President Ferdinand E. Marcos and his wife, Imelda. The superceding indictment 
returned in New York accused the Marcoses of illegally funneling an additional 
$77 million into the United States. The initial racketeering conspiracy 
indictment last October accused the Marcoses and eight co-defendants of looting 
the Philippine treasury of more than $100 million, buying Manhattan real estate 
and expensive artworks, and of defrauding U.S. banks on more than $165 million 
in loans to Marcos properties. The Marcoses have lived in exile in Hawaii since 
February, 1986.

AIDS IN THE MILITARY: SOLDIERS TELL OF ARMY BASE 'LEPER COLONY' 
</P>

As friends looked on, afraid to say anything, Pvt. John O. Brisbois packed his 
bags last October and left his barracks with no intention of ever going back. 
Brisbois said he fled the Army, and the only career he had ever wanted, after a 
demotion and three months of harassment. The trouble came after a blood test 
showed that he carries the virus that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"The Army did everything possible to make me want to leave," said Brisbois, 
who, after three months absent without leave, surrendered and tried to kill 
himself. He was discharged last month. "I feel I don't have a future anymore. I 
don't want to die, but I get so depressed." 
</P>
<P>
Brisbois, 24, fled a special barracks wing, known on the base as the "HIV 
hotel" and "the leper colony," to which he and scores of other soldiers had 
been transferred. 
</P>
<P>
The barracks wing is the armed forces' first consolidated housing for 
HIV-infected troops. It represents an escalation of the military's battle 
against acquired immune deficiency syndrome, one that is being waged with 
weapons such as blood testing, mandatory pledges to avoid risky sex practices 
and courts-martial of homosexuals -- weapons generally not allowed under 
civilian law. 
</P>
<P>
"I think, gradually, we are seeing a pattern of more restrictions on what 
people (infected with AIDS virus) can do," said Kathy Gilbert, head of the 
Military Law Task Force of the National Lawyers Guild in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Military Defends Rules 
</P>
<P>
The military defends these rules as necessary to control the AIDS epidemic. 
"The reason we have done what we have done," said Maj. Robert Redfield, of 
Rockville, Md., chief scientist for the Army's AIDS research effort, "is that 
we think it's good medicine -- and it's medicine that might work in the 
civilian sector, as well." 
</P>
<P>
At Redfield's urging, the Department of Defense began the world's largest 
mandatory program of HIV screening in October, 1985. Since then, every recruit 
has been screened, and those whose tests are positive are barred from the Army, 
Navy, Air Force and Marines. About 5 million soldiers and recruits have been 
tested, and 6,000 of those on active duty have shown up positive. 
</P>
<P>
Those already in the military are allowed to remain until they become too sick 
to work. They are allowed to continue in their chosen military career fields if 
they are able, said Susan Hansen of the Department of Defense's Public Affairs 
Office in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Official policy is that individuals "shall not be separated on the basis of 
their HIV status," Hansen said. She added that the Pentagon strongly 
discourages any discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line, in terms of Army policy, is readiness," said Lt. Col. Greg 
Rickson of the Office of the Secretary of the Army at the Pentagon. "Is Army 
readiness affected by having an HIV soldier in the ranks? The commander has to 
weigh that carefully." 
</P>
<P>
At Ft. Hood, home of III Corps and the biggest tank and artillery post in the 
world, then-commanding officer Lt. Gen. Crosbie Saint exercised his prerogative 
and ordered HIV-positive soldiers to be removed from their units. Saint, who 
now commands all U.S. troops in Europe, argued that readiness for deployment to 
Europe in case of war was more important than prohibitions against such 
segregation, Army officials at Ft. Hood said. 
</P>
<P>
On April 15, 1988, about 50 HIV-positive soldiers were transferred to the 
fort's administrative center, which houses a non-combat unit. Most of the 
transferred men were lodged on the third floor of Building 21006. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Confidentiality 
</P>
<P>
"I remember that day clearly. How could I forget it?" said one recently 
discharged soldier who spoke on condition of anonymity. "Everybody knew that we 
were the HIVs, you know. There was no confidentiality, none at all. It was like 
somebody put signs around our necks saying 'here come the AIDS patients.' " 
</P>
<P>
After the transfers, many of the men, like Brisbois, were demoted to lesser 
jobs. According to Maj. James Small, head of the infectious-diseases department 
at Ft. Hood, about 50 of 70 men who tested positive have been moved to Building 
21006. Some who are married have been allowed to continue living off base. 
</P>
<P>
From the outside, the building looks like any of the other barracks that dot 
the 340-square-mile base, where 38,000 soldiers live. Inside, security is 
unusually visible, however. Sentries hastily summon superiors to deflect a 
reporter's questions about the special wing on the third floor. Most soldiers 
refused to acknowledge questions about the wing. Some would talk, but only off 
the base, and they asked that their names be withheld. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody might be scared to say anything," a recently discharged soldier 
said. "You go through the Article 15 (disciplinary actions) list and see how 
many are HIVs. They are giving out seven or eight Article 15s a day over there. 
There's no morale over there. Every night when I was there, someone was put on 
extra duty. We never could go out at night." 
</P>
<P>
Small, the medical officer, strongly denied such allegations, made by eight 
past or present residents of the wing. "We don't have quarantine in the Army," 
he said. He said efforts are made to keep the soldiers on their career tracks 
and to give them quality medical care. 
</P>
<P>
Who has AIDS and who doesn't is the gossip of Building 21006, which also houses 
soldiers whose HIV tests were negative, one young man in the special wing said. 
"Let's put it this way: It's a driving thought on everybody's mind," he said. 
He added that everybody knows, or suspects, who the HIV-positive men are. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're in the latrine," said another, "and you hear somebody laying down 
a tarp in the shower because they don't want to get infected, it ain't easy. 
Being HIV-positive, that's enough to deal with. It's that blanket, that sword 
that they put over your head every single day, that's the hard thing to deal 
with." 
</P>
<P>
All the soldiers said that morale on the base declined drastically after the 
housing transfers, and at least two HIV-positive soldiers said they had thought 
about suicide. 
</P>
<P>
One of them was Brisbois. When he went Absent Without Leave, he fled 250 miles 
south, to see Robert (Papa Bear) Edwards, director of the San Antonio AIDS 
Foundation. Brisbois told Edwards about the "quarantine unit" at Ft. Hood. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards and attorney Louis Font of Boston, who specializes in military law, 
advised Brisbois to surrender at Lackland Air Force Base, where treatment of 
HIV soldiers is considered relatively humane. "We advised the Army and the Air 
Force that he was in a delicate frame of mind," Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arrested and Jailed 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, military police arrived at the Air Force base, put Brisbois in 
handcuffs and leg irons and drove him to the Ft. Hood stockade. There, he was 
handed a bottle of delousing shampoo labeled "Poison" in bold print. Brisbois 
walked back to the showers and drank the shampoo. The guards had Brisbois' 
stomach pumped and returned him to the stockade. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the incident, Brisbois was given a general discharge from the 
Army. He is now fighting for medical and other veterans' benefits. 
</P>
<P>
There are no statistics on how many HIV-infected soldiers have attempted 
suicide, but Brisbois' situation is not unique, civilian advocates said. Just 
outside San Antonio, at Ft. Sam Houston, another soldier told of his emotional 
disintegration after he learned that he was positive. He proudly showed a 1986 
Letter of Commendation and his 1987 Army Achievement Medal for "exceptionally 
meritorious service." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not dealing with the HIV that's stressful, it's everything else," he 
said. He told how he was shuttled from job to job on base and was unable to get 
psychological counseling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Medical Coverage 
</P>
<P>
Along with the pain of discrimination comes the fear of being discharged and 
left without medical coverage. Most of the still-active HIV-positive personnel 
interviewed said they hoped to obtain medical discharges so they would continue 
to get free treatment. A medical discharge may come when the immune system 
becomes sharply weakened by the virus. 
</P>
<P>
"Look," said one soldier, "we all know we've got an expensive disease ahead of 
us. . . . Now, how in hell am I gonna pay for that on my own? Especially when 
we all know we ain't going to get jobs when we get out of here." 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Defense requires that military personnel sign a "safe-sex 
statement" when they are diagnosed as HIV-positive. It is a pledge not to have 
sex without using a condom, and to inform all sexual partners of the risk. Ft. 
Hood goes a step further: According to Small, infected soldiers there must sign 
a statement promising to abstain from having sex with anyone but a spouse, to 
inform their spouses of the risk and to use condoms. The term sex is not 
defined. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Are Prosecuted 
</P>
<P>
In all the services, HIV-positive soldiers have been denied medical benefits 
for a variety of reasons, and many have been prosecuted for sodomy, 
disobedience and other offenses related to sexual activity. 
</P>
<P>
According to Small, HIV-positive personnel are questioned about their past 
sexual contacts by a civilian nurse, and their answers are kept secret. But, he 
said, the files can be subpoenaed by criminal investigators if someone is 
prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
"We all know that," said one soldier who tested positive. "So of course, most 
people lie. They say Barbara and Diane when they really mean Bob and David."

RAISING OSTRICHES RUFFLES FEATHERS OF OLD-TIME CATTLEMEN

<TEXT>
<P>
Life hasn't been the same the last couple of years on the 1,800-acre Flying S 
Ranch in Northern California's sparsely populated Colusa County, where Ray 
Williams runs a herd of Brahman cattle. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, 47, has been a cowboy all his life, all over the West, working many 
different breeds of cattle and even buffalo and sheep. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first came to this country nobody had Brahmans, but everybody's 
accustomed to them now. It's these damn birds that's changin' things around. 
Biggest birds on earth," allowed Williams. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clowns of Bird World 
</P>
<P>
He was surrounded by the clowns of the bird world, enormous, eight-foot, 300- 
to 325-pound, flightless ostriches with skinny limber necks nearly half their 
length and funny, fuzzy small heads with duck-like bills, soft brown eyes and 
thick black eyelashes. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever thought ranching would come to this," sighed the cowpoke as one of the 
ostriches began pecking at his jacket buttons. Williams raised his finger in 
the air, admonishing the bird to cut it out. 
</P>
<P>
Another big bird uncorked its neck and in a flash with its bill grabbed the cap 
off the cowboy's head. "Give that back," shouted Williams sternly, and the 
ostrich dropped his lid. "Playful critters aren't they?" mused the cowboy. 
</P>
<P>
The Flying S is one of a dozen ostrich farms and ranches in California, one of 
about 200 growers in the nation with a total of about 5,000 birds, mostly in 
Texas and Oklahoma. Ostrich farms are an answer to trade sanctions against 
South Africa imposed in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, this country had been importing upward of 90,000 ostrich hides a 
year from South Africa. The soft grained leather is used to make purses, belts, 
shoes and boots. 
</P>
<P>
Now the big push among ostrich growers is to build up numbers. The birds 
command a lot of money: $2,000 for a chick, $25,000 to $35,000 for breeding 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
"Ostriches are going to be big business in America within a few years, just you 
watch and see," said Svend Steffen, 54, owner of the Flying S who also owns and 
operates a steel company in Redwood City. "Not only for the hides, but for the 
meat and feathers as well," he added. 
</P>
<P>
An ostrich yields 90 pounds of cholesterol-free, beef-like meat. "Ostrich meat 
is a popular dinner item in South Africa. I never tire of eating ostrich. It 
tastes great," insisted Steffen. He has 22 ostriches and plans to have as many 
as 200 within a few months. 
</P>
<P>
"These birds are similar to chickens in many ways," chimed in Williams. "Males 
are called roosters, females, hens, babies, chicks. Like chickens they roost at 
night and males, like barnyard roosters, make a lot of noise at sunup. Male 
ostriches make a booming noise. It makes your hair stand on end. It's like 
something you've never heard before." 
</P>
<P>
The cowboy laughed and said, "Imagine eating an ostrich drumstick. One 
drumstick is enough to feed nearly a dozen people. One ostrich egg weighs three 
pounds and equals 26 chicken eggs." An ostrich hen lays an egg every other day 
with a total of 40 to 60 eggs in a laying season. Eggs hatch out in 42 days. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ostrich Runways 
</P>
<P>
The big birds on the Flying S Ranch are kept in two acres embraced by a 
six-foot high fence. Eight 200-foot-long runways are in the ostrich yard. The 
birds exercise by racing back and forth at speeds at times in excess of 40 
m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't cowboy ostriches. No way is anybody going to lasso one of those 
characters," observed Williams, who begins his day at sunup feeding his birds 
corn, barley and alfalfa pellets. 
</P>
<P>
"They're waiting at the gate to greet me. I kind of take a shine to some of the 
friendlier birds like Big John over there and Sam and this hen I call Lucy," 
said Williams, scratching Lucy on her long neck. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the day, Williams is out on the ranch cowboying like most cowboys 
do -- with cows, not birds.

HIGH-TECH GROWTH INDUSTRY; 
</P>
<P>
BUSINESS BOOMING IN TOXIC WASTE DISPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Forget plastics. The glow is off computers. Hazardous waste disposal is the 
high-tech growth industry of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
So say some of the 500 environmental entrepreneurs, executives and consultants 
who attended a two-day conference on how to profit from America's toxic waste 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Two or three years ago if you'd said you're having a hazardous waste business 
conference, you'd get very few people showing up," said Stephen L. Irish, whose 
company extracts heavy metals from contaminated waste water. 
</P>
<P>
But it was standing room only at a session last week in the Copley Plaza 
Hotel's ornate ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Identifying Markets' 
</P>
<P>
The subject: "Identifying Market Opportunities in the Hazardous Waste 
Industry," or, as one person attending put it, "Given that companies don't 
publicize their hazardous waste problems, how do we identify potential 
customers?" 
</P>
<P>
Other sessions covered how to comply with environmental regulations, how to 
minimize legal liability, "Surviving Hypergrowth" and "Preventing Your 
Employees from Becoming Your Archrivals," or how to protect toxic trade 
secrets. 
</P>
<P>
The beverage served everywhere was mineral water. 
</P>
<P>
Hazardous waste processing will be a $5-billion industry this year and could 
hit $12 billion by 1994, said conference organizer Richard S. Golob, publisher 
of Hazardous Materials Intelligence Report, a weekly newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Shortage of Chores 
</P>
<P>
There's no shortage of stuff to clean up. The Environmental Protection Agency 
has identified 30,000 potentially hazardous sites, of which 1,000 qualify for 
Superfund cleanup money. According to Golob, other surveys have estimated that 
up to 430,000 U.S. manufacturing plants may have some kind of contamination. 
</P>
<P>
And the Department of Energy has estimated that managing, disposing and 
cleaning up radioactive and hazardous contamination at its facilities could 
cost from $53 billion to $92 billion, DOE spokesman Will Callicott said. 
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, consumer products and even decaffeinated 
coffee produces hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
As environmental regulations get stiffer, companies that can deal with 
infectious waste, radioactive contamination and dirty drinking water are in 
special demand. 
</P>
<P>
Irish's enterprise was born in 1988 from tougher state and federal ground water 
regulations. Electroplating plants produce rinse water containing heavy metals, 
including nickel, lead and a carcinogenic chromium compound, said Irish, 
director of marketing for UNC Reclamation, a Mulberry, Fla., subsidiary of UNC 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
UNC Reclamation installs equipment that extracts metals from rinse water, Irish 
said. The residue is turned into metal salts that can be sold back to the 
electroplaters, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The service costs electroplaters less than disposing of their metallic sludge 
in landfills. And it eliminates their long-term legal liability, Irish said. 
The process also ensures that no contaminants will leak from a landfill into 
ground water. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly it's the intent of Congress to keep anything from going into the 
ground," Irish said. "Reclamation is what they want." 
</P>
<P>
UNC Reclamation generated a slight profit last year and sales are expected to 
hit $12 million this year, he said. The company plans to expand into cleaning 
up toxic sludge from batteries that have been dumped into some Gainesville, 
Fla., lagoons. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental boom already has produced some hazardous waste millionaires, 
Golob said. One high-tech entrepreneur is Alan S. McKim, who founded Clean 
Harbors Inc. of Boston in 1980 at age 25. The company said it now has nearly 
1,000 employees and had sales of $73 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
But the industry has to cope with more than its share of regulation and red 
tape, said Thomas Moran, vice president of DartAmerica of Freehold, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
DartAmerica transports toxic, low-level nuclear and solid waste to approved 
disposal sites. It is regulated by the EPA, the federal Department of 
Transportation, and has an array of permits that allow it to truck waste in 48 
states. It takes three full-time employees just to handle shipping permits, 
Moran said.

CHURCH VANDALISM TRIGGERS NATIONAL INQUIRY;

<P>
RACIAL HARASSMENT ON UPSWING IN AUSTRALIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID CLARK SCOTT, Christian Science Monitor

<P>
SYDNEY, Australia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again, a black, oily substance oozes down the front door and steps of the 
Pitt Street Uniting Church in downtown Sydney. Every week for months, the 
church has been defaced -- apparently by racists. 
</P>
<P>
For two years now -- ever since South African anti-apartheid activist 
Archbishop Desmond Tutu spoke here -- the Rev. Dorothy McMahon and her 
parishioners have been harassed. 
</P>
<P>
This low-level terrorism -- which has sparked a national inquiry into racial 
violence -- takes the form of bricks tossed through windows, car tires slashed, 
threatening phone calls at night, and human waste thrown at McMahon's home. 
Police advised McMahon -- an outspoken supporter of the African National 
Congress, Aboriginal land rights, and homosexual rights -- to keep silent about 
the incidents. 
</P>
<P>
But last November, after a mock "necklacing" outside her home -- an effigy of a 
woman with a tire around its neck was burned -- McMahon went public. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, we felt a sense of impotence, powerlessness in face of it. Since going 
public, we've had amazing support from people all over country," McMahon said. 
"I feel tired, but more peaceful and stronger. I feel much more able to be 
uncompromising in my stands. People say, 'How could that be?' And I say: 'But 
you're praying for me. Don't you believe your prayer really works?' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
People Step Forward 
</P>
<P>
Since McMahon spoke up, more people have stepped forward with complaints. For 
example, in the west coast city of Perth, two Chinese restaurants have been 
firebombed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're probably looking at well over 100 incidents, but those are only the 
cases we know about now," said Irene Moss, the federal race discrimination 
commissioner in charge of the national inquiry. She notes studies in Britain 
indicate that as much as 75% of racially motivated violence goes unreported. 
</P>
<P>
The principal targets in Australia are Asian immigrants, Aborigines -- 
Australia's black natives -- anti-apartheid activists, and a growing list of 
politicians and journalists raising race-related issues. 
</P>
<P>
The harassment appears to be the work of a few right-wing individuals and small 
extremist groups. Often the attacks are anonymous. "Cowardly hit-and-run 
vandalism," said Commander Michael O'Brien of the New South Wales police. 
</P>
<P>
The Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging, a pro-South African apartheid group in 
Australia, claimed responsibility for the mock necklacing at McMahon's home. 
Pamphlets from the Australian Nationalist Movement, a neo-Nazi group, and 
National Action have been left after vandalism at the Pitt Street Uniting 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nationalists Blamed 
</P>
<P>
National Action, a nationalist political group, has been most frequently blamed 
for the rise in racial violence. But this is perhaps because it is the most 
public group. 
</P>
<P>
National Action chairman James Saleam will only say that membership numbers 
more than a few hundred. The group opposes Marxism, capitalism, and the 
globalization of economies and cultures. It advocates a "white Australia" 
immigration policy. One recent handout calls a Sydney real estate agent a 
"traitor" for "selling Australia for Asian money." The agent's home address and 
phone number are given with the command: "If you've had enough . . . let Max 
(the agent) know!" 
</P>
<P>
Saleam admits that such tactics are aggressive and is sympathetic to the aims 
of other extremist groups. He notes that his organization has had bricks tossed 
through its storefront window. But he denies that National Action is directly 
involved in any vandalism or criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't any future as a subterranean criminal gang, because either you 
become the IRA (Irish Republican Army) or you don't," Saleam said. "We think 
the political situation in Australia will become more radical, and 
organizations like National Action will grow. So, we're very careful here, we 
don't want to be suppressed for criminal activity." 
</P>
<P>
But last month, the secretary of National Action was arrested on the charge of 
"violent disorder." He was one of 10 National Action members wearing balaclavas 
who burst into a Liberal Party (Australia's main conservative party) 
fund-raising dinner. Witnesses said that the demonstrators distributed 
leaflets, chanted slogans, and threatened to kill the main speaker, Helen 
Sham-Ho, an Asian member of the state parliament. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overlapping Memberships 
</P>
<P>
The arrested National Action member was formerly an official of a disbanded 
pro-white South Africa group. Police say political militant groups are often 
made up of members who move around or have overlapping memberships. 
</P>
<P>
The recent surge in racial violence coincides with a vigorous debate on 
immigration policy. Racist elements have been given a green light by 
politicians such as opposition leader John Howard, McMahon said. 
</P>
<P>
"Every community can be lifted up or discouraged depending on the leadership 
and the level of hope given," she said. "People who encourage racism are 
probably fairly full of self-hate and despair and encourage the community to 
lower its expectations of what it can handle." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Howard indicated that he might consider limiting Asian immigration 
if he became prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
Although Commissioner Moss's home was daubed with racist slogans recently, she 
does not believe racism is rife in Australian society. For a country with 120 
nationalities and 40% of the population from a non-English speaking background, 
she said, Australia remains quite tolerant and easygoing by world standards. 
Moss hopes the national inquiry will nip emerging racial problems in the bud. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Climate of General Acceptance' 
</P>
<P>
"People say: 'What's a bit of brick throwing or tire slashing?' But if these 
small abuses go on and society tolerates it, you then create a climate of 
general acceptance which could lead to worse things. A responsible society has 
to look at this and do something about it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Australia does have anti-discrimination laws. But there are no laws against 
inciting racial violence -- yet. The Parliament of New South Wales, the most 
populous state, is considering such a bill that would impose large fines and a 
maximum six-month jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
National Action's Saleam considers the proposal an effort to suppress his 
organization's political views. The Australian Writers Guild has also express 
concern that such a law could inhibit freedom of speech. And Saleam calls the 
inquiry into racial violence a witch hunt. 
</P>
<P>
After receiving written submissions, the federal inquiry will conduct public 
hearings beginning in June. The panel will issue a report by the end of the 
year.

FROM UZIS TO LUXURY CARS TO COCONUTS, PHILIPPINE CONGRESS EMBROILED IN SCANDAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL C. SUAREZ, Associated Press 
</P>

MANILA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Closed by resident Ferdinand E. Marcos in 1972 and reopened just over a year 
ago, the Philippine Congress now is swept up in scandals. 
</P>
<P>
Hardly had the dust settled on a scandal involving firearms imports when 
members of the House of Representatives were facing charges of trying to corner 
the export of coconuts to Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate also has come under fire for deciding to use taxpayers' money to buy 
35 foreign luxury cars for each of its 23 members and certain staff. 
</P>
<P>
Just before the coconut scandal broke in late January, columnist Neal Cruz of 
the Daily Globe wrote that the rubber-stamp congressmen during Marcos' time 
"look like saints compared to the members of (this) Congress." 
</P>
<P>
"First, some gun runners in the House of Representatives import hundreds of 
high-powered automatic firearms for the protection of congressmen -- and the 
rest for the lucrative black market," he added. "Just as the public heaved a 
collective sigh of relief that . . . the senators are not involved in this 
caper comes the revelation that all 23 senators have ordered new cars." 
</P>
<P>
The coconut scandal exploded Jan. 25 when the chairman of the Philippine 
Coconut Authority claimed that at least 12 congressmen were pressuring his 
organization to grant them exclusive rights to export 4,500 tons of fresh 
coconut to Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Romero said the congressmen, from four coconut-growing provinces south of 
Manila, were insisting that the authority not only restore a quota system it 
had recently scrapped but also to allow them to participate in the coconut 
export quota. 
</P>
<P>
He said that until last year, his agency awarded the entire quota to a group of 
Filipino exporters but decided three months ago to stop the practice because of 
complaints from other groups. The move was also in line with the government's 
policy of deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
The congressmen, led by Rep. Leonardo Guerrero, contended that they simply were 
trying to protect the interests of small coconut farmers in their provinces 
from middlemen who they claim had monopolized the export in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero, chairman of the House subcommittee on edible crops, denied Romero's 
charges and accused him of receiving bribes from middlemen. 
</P>
<P>
The uproar over the firearms scandal is not over, even though the 200-member 
House cleared two congressmen of wrongdoing in the importation of more than 600 
Israeli-made Uzi and Galil automatic rifles. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said the imports lacked permits from his 
department; customs officials said other regulations were broken. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, after a closed special session, the House ruled that the two 
congressmen who brokered the importation did not commit any improprieties. The 
House voted, however, to turn the weapons over to the military "in response to 
public opinion." 
</P>
<P>
Reps. Rodrigo Gutang and Renato Unico, both retired military officers, said the 
guns were to have been paid for by the congressmen with their own money. They 
said the legislators needed the weapons to defend themselves from rising crime 
and threats from communist rebels. 
</P>
<P>
As the gun controversy raged, someone leaked the Senate's decision to buy 35 
new cars. The public uproar was immediate, with most comment accusing the 
senators of callousness in light of widespread poverty.

LEBANON'S TRAFFIC COPS -- THEY GET NO RESPECT AND VERY LITTLE OF ANYTHING ELSE

Guns, kicks and curses are daily dangers for traffic police in Beirut, but some 
give almost as good as they get. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to jump in front of the car to make the driver stop," says Officer 
Mustafa Jendi. "The driver slapped me, I slapped him back. He drew his gun, I 
drew mine. He brought out a machine gun so I ran away." 
</P>
<P>
Each traffic officer has his own way to deal with offenders. Lebanon's civil 
war has so weakened the legal system that it is pointless to write tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Jamal Mansour says he punches the doors of the cars, Selim Saadeh leaps over 
the hoods, Mustafa Haj kicks the drivers and Jamil Yousef waves the traffic to 
a halt and then goes home. 
</P>
<P>
Mansour tells of another defeat that cost the remnants of his self-respect. 
</P>
<P>
"I begged him to give me his driving license because he was driving on the 
pavement (sidewalk). I told him it was only to save my face in front of 
hundreds of drivers and that he could take it back in minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"He refused, telling me it was not my business," Mansour says. 
</P>
<P>
Lebanese drivers, survivors of nearly 14 years of civil war, have little time 
or regard for the traffic policemen of Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
Paid meager wages, the officers go to work on ancient motorcycles, in dented 
Japanese cars or on foot. 
</P>
<P>
It is common to see policemen on Beirut's streets in the morning and evening 
rush hours arguing, shouting, cursing or exchanging punches with the drivers 
who disobey them. Occasionally there are gun fights. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic policemen are accustomed to being snubbed or regarded as irrelevant in 
a country with thousands of Lebanese, Syrian and Israeli troops, U.N. 
peacekeepers and militiamen. 
</P>
<P>
Armed only with revolvers, they do not pose enough of a threat to such frequent 
offenders as militiamen for whom only the gun is law. 
</P>
<P>
The very few traffic signs left standing in Lebanon are rarely used to guide 
drivers. Many are plastered with posters for restaurants, cinemas, nightclubs 
or even death notices. 
</P>
<P>
The last traffic light flickering in the capital stood in the once-wealthy 
Christian neighborhood of Ashrafiyeh until recently. But it was stolen, 
probably to illuminate a night club dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
Officers say it is almost impossible to keep order on the streets of Lebanon, 
where few drivers abide by the rules. With 300 men and little equipment, the 
traffic police have an almost hopeless mission. 
</P>
<P>
They use their flashlights at night as traffic lights. They carry tree 
branches, rocks, used tires, and garbage barrels to the side of roads to 
replace road signs and warn of hazards. 
</P>
<P>
Many Lebanese civilians, frustrated at their own powerlessness to end the civil 
war, proudly tell stories about how toughly they deal with the traffic cops -- 
the only authority they can beat. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever I don't like a policeman I beat him up and put him in the boot 
(trunk) of my car and pull his mustache if he has one," says 60-year-old Fouad 
Helmi, also known as Abu Al-Mouwas (father of razors). 
</P>
<P>
He says the only traffic policemen he sees are usually enjoying a meal of bread 
and olives set on the hood of a car or smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee 
in cafes. 
</P>
<P>
Drivers, shopkeepers and pedestrians often take the initiative themselves and 
direct traffic to clear a traffic jam. Militiamen know they can easily clear a 
way by firing in the air. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to drive my children to school in a T-54 tank," says Kamal Merheg, a 
militiaman in Christian East Beirut since the start of the civil war. 
</P>
<P>
"My friends and I raced with M-113 troop carriers. I don't need a traffic 
policeman to tell me how or where to drive."

IN THE PHILIPPINES, THE PRESIDENT IS OFTEN THE COURT OF LAST RESORT FOR MANY

Some need help in tracking down missing spouses. Others appeal for government 
benefits. And they come to President Corazon Aquino as their court of last 
resort. 
</P>
<P>
Every year, thousands of ordinary Filipinos turn to Aquino, as they did to her 
predecessors, for help with the mundane problems of life and in sidestepping a 
bloated, cumbersome bureaucracy and ineffectual local government. 
</P>
<P>
They might not be the sort of problems that would involve the White House. 
</P>
<P>
But in a paternalistic society, tradition demands that the boss take care of 
subordinates. The president is not only expected to wrestle with complex issues 
of statecraft but also unravel red tape and intercede on behalf of the average 
Filipino. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Source of All Solutions' 
</P>
<P>
"With a historical background of colonialism and a succession of 
governors-general in Spanish and American times, the datus (native chiefs) and 
sultans before that, the Filipino has been oriented to a strong, one-man 
leadership as the source of all solutions," wrote commentator Luis Beltran in 
The Manila Standard. 
</P>
<P>
Ricardo Galing, director of the presidential Office of Public Assistance, said 
his department processed more than 30,000 requests for assistance in 1987, the 
last year when complete records were available. 
</P>
<P>
The office was established in the 1950s and maintains a staff of about 100 
people to help with citizen complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Galing said some of the appeals come from town mayors, village officials and 
even congressmen seeking help from constituents. But most come from ordinary 
people, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"About 80% of those who come here to ask the government for help are our 
brothers and sisters in the depressed areas of the country," Galing said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Common Requests 
</P>
<P>
He said the most common requests involve applications for government jobs, 
medical assistance or resolving rental, labor and property disputes. 
</P>
<P>
A few seek help in marital disputes or tracking down spouses who went abroad 
for work and disappeared, he said. There were no figures on how many problems 
had been resolved to the satisfaction of the applicant. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, we just refer walk-ins to the proper government office and call 
ahead to say that so-and-so is on his way and to help them," Galing said. 
"Sometimes we have to refer the problem in writing for a response." 
</P>
<P>
Others put their problems directly to Aquino in her weekly radio broadcast, 
"Ask The President," which the government radio network carries every Sunday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Questions Screened 
</P>
<P>
The government's Philippine Information Agency solicits and screens the 
questions. Aquino answers about a dozen of them every week -- but sometimes 
short of what the supplicants had hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
One caller, Alberto Tangapa of Cagayan de Oro, appealed recently for a 
government job so he could overcome "the injustices our family had suffered due 
to the cruel society to which we belong." 
</P>
<P>
"Please submit your application to the Department of Labor," Aquino replied. 
"If you are qualified and if there are available positions, you may be hired." 
</P>
<P>
During another recent broadcast, a resident of Rizal province complained that 
his neighbor's fence was blocking the pathway to his home. 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor knows what they are doing is illegal but they won't stop it," he 
complained. "What can we do?" 
</P>
<P>
"Before I give a rightful answer to your problem, I first want to know all the 
details," Aquino responded. She ordered the Land Management Bureau to look into 
the dispute.

Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) warned fellow Democrats Friday that they are losing the 
"heart of the electorate" and must prove to mainstream voters that they can be 
trusted. 
</P>
<P>
In a keynote address to the Democratic Leadership Council a day after he 
successfully led the fight against the nomination of John Tower as defense 
secretary, Nunn stressed that the party must move quickly to recapture 
middle-class voters. 
</P>
<P>
"Democratic support is hemorrhaging in the heart of the electorate," Nunn told 
the council, organized as a showcase for some of the more moderate party 
members. "We are losing the working and middle-class Americans who used to be 
the mainstay of our party's governing coalition."

AIR FORCE FINDS RADAR AND ARMED AIRCRAFT A HAZARDOUS MIX 
</P>

<P>
In the control tower at Robins Air Force Base, Ga., Master Sgt. George Green 
asks one important question when the pilot of a fighter, attack or bomber 
aircraft requests permission to make an unscheduled landing. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you carrying external electro-explosive devices?" 
</P>
<P>
If the answer is yes, chief controller Green picks up a direct line to the 
operator of the PAVE PAWS radar installation two miles south of the central 
Georgia base. 
</P>
<P>
The radar operator flips a switch, and for several minutes, until the plane 
lands, half of the $90 million radar screen, built to give instantaneous 
warning of any submarine-launched missile off the southeastern United States, 
is shut down. 
</P>
<P>
Since November, 1987, the Air Force now acknowledges, the north face of PAVE 
PAWS at Robins has been turned off an average of 14 times a month -- for a 
total down time of about an hour a month -- so that planes carrying externally 
mounted EEDs can land. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Precautionary Shutdowns 
</P>
<P>
Operation of the defensive warning system is interrupted to prevent accidental 
detonations of the EEDs, tiny explosive charges that are in virtually every 
military weapons system and in the planes and ships that deliver them. 
</P>
<P>
EEDs are used, among other things, to trigger weapons, drop bombs, or jettison 
fuel tanks. They are detonated by an electrical circuit, but can be set off by 
high levels of electromagnetic energy from environmental sources such as radio 
waves, radar, static electricity and lightning. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force insists that the periodic interruptions have not hindered the 
effectiveness of the early warning system because the shutdowns occur at random 
and other radars are available as backups. Routine maintenance, the Air Force 
says, shuts the radar down for about 40 hours a month. 
</P>
<P>
"Our primary concern at Robins with PAVE PAWS is safety of flight," Lt. Col. 
John Harmon, commander of the base communications squadron, said. "We want to 
make sure that we have procedures in effect so there is no possibility of any 
plane having externally mounted EEDs flying in a dangerous situation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protects Wide Area 
</P>
<P>
PAVE PAWS stands for Precision Acquisition Vehicle Entry Phased Array Warning 
System. The 10-story, pyramid-shaped installation at Robins, one of four such 
facilities in the nation, has thousands of computer-directed antennas that can 
scan 240 degrees to a distance of 3,000 miles. The radar reportedly can 
identify an object the size of a basketball when it is 1,500 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
The radar near Robins is the only one near an active runway; there have been no 
problems reported near the others. 
</P>
<P>
PAVE PAWS had been in operation for a year at Robins before Air Force officials 
became convinced that its powerful electromagnetic emissions might endanger 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
They instituted the periodic shutdown procedure and established a restricted 
zone around the radar of one nautical mile, about 6,000 feet, for all aircraft 
flying at or below 6,400 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force contends that it has taken a conservative and cautious approach 
at Robins, but critics, such as Patricia Axelrod, coordinator of the HERO 
Project, say the location of the radar near a base where ordnance is handled is 
a disaster waiting to happen. The air base, Georgia's largest, is near the 
community of Warner-Robins, population 40,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Federal Suit Filed 
</P>
<P>
The HERO Project, which derives its name from the Navy acronym Hazard of 
Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance, is part of a coalition that has filed 
suit in federal court in Washington, alleging that the military has not 
shielded its weaponry sufficiently to prevent accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Axelrod and the defense specialists assisting her in the lawsuit say that the 
6,000-foot hazard zone is not sufficient. She cited Navy documents recommending 
that the EA-6 Prowler airplane, laden with electronic-warfare equipment far 
less powerful than PAVE PAWS, should be kept at least 8,000 feet away from 
areas where ordnance is handled. 
</P>
<P>
Axelrod also said the flight restrictions at Robins force pilots into "a 
trapeze act without a net" because of the possibility of human error in the 
chain of communication required to shut down the radar when a plane is landing. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, also 
has criticized the restrictions because of their reliance "on the potentially 
fallible human links between the pilot, control tower, and PAVE PAWS radar 
operators." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Evaluation Requested 
</P>
<P>
Nunn has asked the Air Force for an official evaluation of the potential 
hazards to aircraft at Robins, and of the long-term adequacy of the current 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Donald J. Kutyna, who heads the Air Force Space Command responsible 
for the warning system, acknowledged in a recent interview that he would rather 
have the radar someplace else. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on what I know today, the radar may not hurt anything, but there is some 
concern. Otherwise, there wouldn't be any flight restrictions," he said. "If I 
had the choice, all things being equal, I would put the radar where I would not 
have to impose any safety zone." 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force said the initial environmental assessment for PAVE PAWS concluded 
that the restricted zone needed around the radar would not interfere with the 
flight paths of any aircraft using the Robins runway. 
</P>
<P>
That conclusion was changed in 1987. Further calculations were made while the 
Air Force was developing plans to triple the power of PAVE PAWS to enhance its 
ability to track satellites in space. The new figures indicated that a larger 
restricted zone was needed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Peak Power Measured 
</P>
<P>
The key difference in the new calculation was the way the radar's power was 
measured. The first assessment used the average power of the radar pulses over 
time; the later one used the peak power of each pulse. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force officials acknowledge that the contractor who did the initial 
assessment recommended using peak power to calculate the restricted zone, but 
that advice was rejected because Air Force experts at the time did not believe 
brief exposure of an EED to the radar pulses would be hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
"We were on the cutting edge of technology with PAVE PAWS at the time we made 
that initial environmental assessment," Kutyna said. "To have learned something 
new since that time does not say that you were making a mistake before." 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force already has spent $600,000 to have Raytheon Corp., which built 
the radar system, study the problem. Raytheon recommended moving the 
installation, at a cost of $37.7 million, or modifying it, at a cost of $27 
million, so it would shut down automatically if a plane breached the restricted 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Permanent Solution Sought 
</P>
<P>
Kutyna said moving the radar is not feasible, but the modification proposal is 
under consideration. He said a panel of senior Air Force officers has been 
convened to make recommendations by June on a permanent solution to end the 
flight restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Air Force has shelved its plan to triple the radar's power 
so it could take over the space-tracking functions of the outdated radar system 
at Eglin Air Force Base, Fla., at an annual savings of $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless there is a solution in the books that comes out of this study, I would 
say the chances of putting that (power) upgrade on there at this time are not 
high," Kutyna said.

ALLIGATOR FARMING NEW GROWTH INDUSTRY

Call it toothy gold, a get-rich quick plan for an area devastated by the crash 
of the oil market. 
</P>
<P>
Across Louisiana's marshes, once flush with profits from black gold, small 
patches of land increasingly are being turned into alligator farms, with 
investors hoping to quintuple their investments in short order. 
</P>
<P>
"Year before last, there were just under 9,000 farm-raised gators sold" by 37 
farms, said Dave Taylor, alligator research coordinator for Louisiana's 
Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. "That number is going to reach 60,000 
quickly and could be up to 100,000, certainly, within five years." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
24,000 Trapped in Wilds 
</P>
<P>
That's in addition to the 24,000 wild alligators trapped each fall in carefully 
supervised hunts. 
</P>
<P>
Spurred by prices of $37 a linear foot for hides, 21 new farms have opened in 
the last two years, and "We expect them to produce 18,000 gators," Taylor said. 
The waiting list for permits for new farms is about 100. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Jones Jr., 28, went into business two years ago near Sweetlake and 
expects to put 12,000 hides a year on the market. His farm is state-of-the-art: 
automated cleaning, water-source heat pumps, carefully supervised diets. 
</P>
<P>
The result is quicker growth at less cost. "We have some (that) are 5 to 6 feet 
long in a year and six months. We have 8-month-old gators that are 26 to 30 
inches." 
</P>
<P>
Skins of wild alligators average 7 feet in length, and are used for luggage. 
Farm-raised gators are skinned at 2 years old and about 4 feet long. Their 
hides are used for shoes, purses, belts and other smaller high-fashion 
accouterments requiring smaller patterns on the hides. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Windowless Buildings 
</P>
<P>
For about $30,000 a potential farmer can put up a couple of windowless 
cinder-block buildings on concrete slabs and be ready to raise 1,000 gators a 
year. It would take another $25,000 to $30,000 to operate until the gators grow 
enough to sell. At current prices, 1,000 4-foot hides would bring $148,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The minimum requirements are 1 square foot per alligator up to 2 feet in 
length and 2 square feet up to 4 feet in length," Taylor said. Buildings must 
be able to hold a few inches of water and be kept about 89 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The first thing is to gather alligator eggs from wild nests, paying landowners 
for the eggs and committing 17% of the hatch for return to the wild at 4 feet 
long. That's a carefully researched percentage designed for zero growth in the 
population of 1.5 million wild alligators -- reached after the alligator was 
taken off the endangered species list in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The wild nests aren't easy to find, and female alligators guard their eggs -- 
about the only time in their lives that they show maternal instincts. 
</P>
<P>
No task for the timid, Taylor agreed. "But everybody's got to learn some time 
or another, if they want to get into farming. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spot Nests From Air 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, what would be best, for a guy's first involvement, would be to hire 
someone with a little experience in locating nests from the air. That's the 
only way to go: Rent a helicopter and go find them and pick them up." 
</P>
<P>
The success of farming ventures will almost certainly drive prices down, and 
there are risks any time a market depends on fashion or something volatile, he 
said. "I don't think the bottom will fall out of the price. I don't think 
they'll go to $2 a foot. But it certainly could go to half of what it is now." 
</P>
<P>
Jones, a former trapper, commercial diver and underwater welder who now devotes 
full time to his farm, agrees with Taylor's analysis. "A lot of these farms, 
you'll see what happens. Prices are good right now, but with all these hides 
coming on the market, it's going to have to go down." 
</P>
<P>
But Jones believes he will survive when others fail because his expenses are 
low. "Look at it this way, you've got an electricity bill of $500 a month to 
raise 1,000 alligators, and my bill is $150 a month to raise 12,000." 
</P>
<P>
His major problem is finding enough nutria -- small water rodents -- to feed 
the gators. Nutria, or coypus, often are dyed like beaver, Jones said.

RECYCLING GAINS FAVOR AS NATION RUNS OUT OF ROOM FOR ITS GARBAGE

Trucks and barges pile 52 million pounds of paper, cans, plastic and other 
trash daily onto a Staten Island dump, building the world's biggest mountain of 
garbage toward a height rivaling the skyscrapers across the bay in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Much of that could be recycled, and New York officials have begun considering a 
plan to do so. Elsewhere, more and more communities are already recycling the 
trash their citizens throw out. 
</P>
<P>
They have little choice. Although the New York dump is planned to be operated 
for 11 more years, a third of the nation's 6,000 garbage dumps are expected to 
be closed within five years, forcing communities to find new ways to dispose of 
their refuse. 
</P>
<P>
Every American man, woman and child generates 3.5 pounds of refuse a day -- 
adding 160 million tons to the nation's trash pile each year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
42% of Trash Is Paper 
</P>
<P>
That pile holds 42% paper, 23% food and yard waste, 9.4% glass, 9.2% metals, 
6.5% plastics and 9.9% other materials, according to the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Ten states already -- or soon will -- require residents to separate newspapers, 
glass jars, milk cartons, tin cans or other discarded items for recycling 
trucks or bins. Legislators in 33 states are expected to consider plans to 
increase recycling this year. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't want incinerators or dumps near them, so they are beginning to 
force their elected officials to start recycling programs," said Cynthia 
Pollock Shea, a senior researcher at Worldwatch Institute, a nonprofit 
organization that studies environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
Recycling is not new in the United States. During World War II, "everybody 
recycled," said Barry Commoner, director of Queens College's Center for the 
Biology of Natural Systems. "People even recycled rubber bands and string." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
10% of Refuse Recycled 
</P>
<P>
But such conservation efforts mostly ended with the war. Now, only 10% of the 
nation's garbage is recycled, compared to as much as 60% by some cities in 
Europe and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Studies say that as much as 86% of household trash could be recycled, and the 
EPA has set a goal of recycling 25% in four years. 
</P>
<P>
The process of recycling is simple: separating usable products from the trash; 
processing them so they can be substituted for more expensive raw materials at 
manufacturing plants; and returning them to the marketplace as parts of new 
products. 
</P>
<P>
It has not been so easy to put into effect. Some communities have had trouble 
finding buyers for discarded newspapers, glass or plastic; recycling programs 
require start-up funds; and, perhaps most important, people's habit of throwing 
trash into only one container is difficult to change. 
</P>
<P>
Still, experts predict that recycling will eventually become a part of the 
everyday infrastructure of cities and towns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recycling Growth Seen 
</P>
<P>
"Today, trash trucks dominate waste hauling," said Peter Grogan, director of 
material recovery for R. W. Beck and Associates, which has helped dozens of 
communities start recycling programs. "But, by the year 2010, we're going to 
see as many recycling trucks as dump trucks, recycling centers as common as 
video shops . . . and recycling introduced in lesson plans in schools across 
the country." 
</P>
<P>
Among the communities now making it easier for residents to recycle trash, 
several are considered international models: 
</P>
<P>
* Hamburg, N. Y., a Buffalo suburb, started a program in 1981 and says that 98% 
of its 3,350 households participate. "Unless they want to eat their garbage, 
they better separate it or we won't pick it up," said Ann Kankolenski, a public 
works department employee. She said 34% of the trash is recycled and nearly all 
the rest burned. 
</P>
<P>
* Seattle residents already recycled 24% of their garbage before the city 
started its program last year, and the city is aiming for 60% in 10 years. Even 
steel garbage cans are being recycled. 
</P>
<P>
* Wilton, N. H., officials say that a voluntary six-town program in 
southwestern New Hampshire has 70% participation. The program, started a decade 
ago, recycles 42% of the garbage brought to a center, burns 47% and buries 11%. 
</P>
<P>
Even more is possible. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Keeps Worms in Basement 
</P>
<P>
Connie Leach, Vermont's recycling director, feeds her food scraps to worms. 
</P>
<P>
"They eat everything up," Leach said of the little red worms that are covered 
with peat moss in a basement box lined with plastic and newspapers. The worms' 
digestive system allows them to eat the food quickly and, so far, it hasn't 
attracted cockroaches or mice. "I've been very surprised at how well it works," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Leach, named Recycler of the Year in 1987 by the National Recycling Coalition, 
does not stop there. She recycles all her household waste except for some types 
of plastics, junk mail on high-grade paper and light bulbs. In a month, she 
throws out only two small bags. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Steyh, Seattle's administrator of garbage and recycling contracts, also goes 
to great lengths to recycle his trash. 
</P>
<P>
He lives on an island in Puget Sound, where he can recycle only tin cans. So, 
on his ferry rides to work, he takes along newspapers, glass, aluminum cans and 
other items. 
</P>
<P>
"I bring them to my in-laws and they recycle it with their things," Steyh said. 
</P>
<P>
Solid waste management companies are expanding into recycling also, creating 
more markets for recycled materials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Getting on the Bandwagon 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is jumping on the bandwagon," said Darlene Snow, recycling director 
for the National Solid Waste Management Assn., which represents 2,500 companies 
that handle half of the nation's household waste and 95% of its industrial 
waste. 
</P>
<P>
She said the industry approached recycling warily. "They had a routine, a 
routine without a lot of regulations. Then, all these (state) laws came," she 
said. "What happened was that haulers nationwide were losing business to 
recycling." 
</P>
<P>
Now, industry seminars on the topic are full, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The recycling movement has also put in jeopardy some proposed trash-to-energy 
incinerators. Plans for such incinerators have been shelved in Los Angeles, 
Seattle, Boston, Philadelphia and Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Incinerators have been promoted as a way to produce energy and reduce the 
amount of garbage, but questions persist about their effect on air quality and 
on the disposal of the byproduct of ash laced with toxins. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
N.Y. Incinerator Opposed 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, New York City proposed what would be the world's largest 
trash-to-energy incineration system. The project, which still needs federal and 
state permits, faces stiff opposition from environmentalists and neighborhood 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists say the solution to the city's garbage crisis should be 
aggressive recycling. Their goals are 60% in 10 years, 90% in 20 years. 
Currently, the city recycles less than 1% of its trash. 
</P>
<P>
However, under legislation proposed earlier this month in New York City, 
mandatory recycling would be phased in over five years. 
</P>
<P>
"The debate has now changed from 'What are we going to do about the garbage 
crisis?' to 'How much can we recycle?' " said David Antonioli, a staff member 
of the New York Public Interest Research Group. "The Earth is not a dump."

SAN DIEGO COUNTY TESTS HOME DETENTION FOR LOW-RISK OFFENDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The convicted drunk-driving offender spends about eight hours a day at his job. 
When he is finished, Jeff can do a little yard work or, since he is 
mechanically inclined, tinker with a few engines. He gets to spend plenty of 
time with his wife and son. The bed in his room is comfortable, he can watch as 
much TV as he wants, and there's a stocked refrigerator down the hall. 
</P>
<P>
If that sounds as good as home, that is because, in this case, the place where 
Jeff is serving his sentence is his Mira Mesa home. 
</P>
<P>
Two and a half years after San Diego County began an experiment alternately 
hailed as innovative and decried as having Orwellian overtones, some convicted 
county criminals now do their time at home, restrained not by bars or handcuffs 
but by electronic sensors. 
</P>
<P>
Under the county's Electronic Surveillance Program (ESP), the first of its kind 
in California, some "low-risk" offenders are permitted to go to work during the 
day while being confined to their homes at night and on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
The offender's movements are monitored by a six-inch-long electronic 
transmitter, strapped to an ankle or wrist, that emits an inaudible beep picked 
up by a receiver connected to the inmate's telephone. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever the offender strays more than 150 feet from the receiver, the device 
detects the absence and registers it with a central computer. If he leaves the 
house without the approval of county probation officers, there is a good chance 
the offender will find himself back in jail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Started in 1986 
</P>
<P>
Since its inception in July, 1986, 550 of the 633 inmates from the Probation 
and Sheriff's departments who have participated in the program have 
successfully completed their confinement at home, according to Cecil Steppe, 
the county's chief probation officer. 
</P>
<P>
That 87% success rate, combined with the contention by supporters that the 
program helps free scarce and expensive jail cells for hardened criminals, 
prompted the Board of Supervisors to press for expansion of the house-arrest 
plan. Doing so, some argue, could be part of the answer to the county's 
longstanding jail crowding problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we ought to expand this to the maximum, without going over the line to 
include people who belong in jail," Supervisor John MacDonald said. "It's one 
of the ways we can cut the continual cost of expanding jails while also making 
it possible to place certain nonviolent offenders in a better situation than 
being tossed in with a lot of hard-core felons." 
</P>
<P>
Critics, however, argue that some offenders placed in the program may be 
getting off easier than they deserve, and warn that expanding the program poses 
possible dangers to the public and could even be unfair to the offenders 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"If somebody ought to be in jail to protect the public, then that's where he 
should be," Municipal Judge H. Ronald Domnitz said. "And, if he doesn't deserve 
to be in jail, then he ought to be in rehabilitative circumstances . . . 
without being hassled by these electronic bracelets." 
</P>
<P>
Since its introduction by Palm Beach County, Fla., in 1984, electronic home 
detention has become increasingly common nationwide, and now is used in 
two-thirds of the states. Although most programs report success rates 
comparable to that of San Diego, even the most ardent advocates doubt that such 
alternatives to conventional incarceration will become, at least for the 
foreseeable future, more than a small part of the overall criminal-justice 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cautious Approach 
</P>
<P>
According to a survey by the Washington-based National Institute of Justice, 
only 2,300 offenders in 33 states were enrolled in electronic home-detention 
programs last year. Although that represented a threefold increase over 1987, 
the relatively small number demonstrates the resistance and cautious approach 
engendered by the program, as well as its limited scope in reducing jail 
populations. 
</P>
<P>
"This is never going to be the answer to jail overcrowding," said Ron Barkett, 
county probation supervisor. "But it may be one way we can keep problems like 
that from getting worse." 
</P>
<P>
Explanations of the program's limitations begin with the relatively narrow 
range of offenders eligible for home detention in San Diego and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the intensive screening used to select home-detention candidates 
in San Diego, Steppe notes that "it's probably harder to get into" the program 
than to successfully complete it. 
</P>
<P>
To date, county officials have not assigned offenders to the program if a judge 
objected -- which is one of the reasons why only about half of those first 
screened are accepted. Probation officers describe that limitation as a 
"courtesy" to judges, but a judicial veto over such assignments is guaranteed 
by recent state legislation authorizing a three-year, statewide pilot project 
similar to San Diego's program. 
</P>
<P>
Eligibility for the San Diego program is now limited to volunteers from the 
county's work-furlough system, in which convicted offenders are allowed to work 
but are locked up overnight in a detention center in Southeast San Diego. 
People convicted of violent offenses, sex crimes and serious drug charges are 
among those excluded from the home-detention program. 
</P>
<P>
Those guidelines automatically rule out the vast majority of jail inmates, 
narrowing the program's reach to offenses such as drunken driving, minor 
burglaries, fraud and various white-collar crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Unless those standards are lowered -- an unlikely occurrence, given the 
likelihood of judicial and public opposition -- house-arrest programs probably 
will never make more than a small dent in local jails' inmate populations, 
which typically are nearly double the facilities' official capacities. As of 
last week, only 23 San Diego residents were under the house-detention program, 
although the number occasionally has been twice that large. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the San Diego program, however, hasten to point out that it was 
never envisioned as a panacea for jail crowding. Rather, it stemmed from 
Steppe's desire to reduce a serious backlog in the work-furlough program that 
often created delays of months between the time a person was sentenced to the 
program and when he actually served his sentence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Certain and Swift 
</P>
<P>
"For punishment to mean anything, it has to be certain and it has to be swift," 
Steppe said. "We were getting to a point in work-furlough where it was 
neither." 
</P>
<P>
With severe economic constraints having become all but a permanent fixture in 
municipal government, the comparatively low price of electronic surveillance is 
one of the program's advantages. 
</P>
<P>
Fees paid by participants -- $10 daily if they earn less than $5 an hour, $15 a 
day for most of those whose salary is higher -- have covered the cost of the 85 
bracelets purchased, the computer used to monitor them and the salaries of the 
two probation officers who oversee the program, Steppe said. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, it costs $28 daily to house a person in the county's work-furlough 
detention center -- with about half that fee being paid by the offender -- and 
$43 a day to feed, clothe and guard jail inmates, according to Probation and 
Sheriff's departments' figures. That latter figure, moreover, does not include 
the jails' multimillion-dollar construction costs -- dramatically widening the 
price differential. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents concede that home detention is cheaper than routine incarceration, 
but contend that economics should not be the guiding principle behind criminal 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess my feeling is, yeah, it's cheaper -- so what?" Domnitz said. "If 
people deserve to be in jail, you don't let them stay at home just because it's 
going to save a few dollars. As far as I'm concerned, this whole thing is just 
a gimmick to reduce jail overcrowding. It's nonsense, period." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Already Has Record 
</P>
<P>
In addition, arguments that house arrest adequately punishes "first-time 
offenders" without being unnecessarily punitive overlooks the fact that 
relatively few people draw a jail sentence for their first minor offense, 
Domnitz and others emphasize. By the time such a person is sentenced to jail, 
he often has committed several offenses and, from the judge's perspective, has 
passed the point where leniency is merited. 
</P>
<P>
Such judicial skepticism and the prevailing public sentiment that house 
detention is too easy a way out for criminals are perhaps the major barriers to 
wider use of such programs, some supporters say. 
</P>
<P>
"California used to be the national leader in innovative programs like this, 
but now we're in such a punitive mode that we're way behind," said Tom 
Gitchoff, a professor of criminal science at San Diego State University. "There 
are ways to punish people other than just sticking them in jail cells. Besides, 
some of these low-risk offenders don't really need to be in expensive, 
maximum-security jails. But the public really doesn't want to hear that these 
days." 
</P>
<P>
Although conceding the obvious by agreeing that home detention is a softer form 
of punishment than jail, Steppe disputes those who characterize the electronic 
surveillance program as being little more than an inconvenience akin to a 
teen-ager being grounded by his parents. 
</P>
<P>
"In some ways, this can be tougher than being in jail," Steppe said. "Sure, 
it's nice to be around your family, but it can get tough when your kids keep 
saying, 'Dad, take us to a movie,' or 'Let's get an ice cream.' Over time, that 
wears on you. . . . In jail, you lay on your behind watching TV. You know why 
you're there. At home, you have more freedom, but it can be psychologically 
tougher . . . accepting the limits. There are temptations and frustrations you 
don't have in jail." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Pretty Stiff Punishment' 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Gina Walker, director of Pride Inc., the private firm that runs Palm 
Beach's home-detention program, said few offenders complete that program 
"feeling they got off easy. Most say it's pretty stiff punishment." Even so, 
the program's appeal to inmates is vividly demonstrated by the fact that 
participants not only agree to pay $9 a day, but also consent to having their 
jail sentences tripled. In other words, an offender facing a 30-day jail 
sentence must serve 90 days under the home program. Despite the longer 
sentences, that program, which handles about 400 offenders annually, has nearly 
a 90% success rate, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although some Florida offenders have been on the program as long as 15 months, 
San Diego officials have generally adhered to a 90-day maximum, feeling that 
compliance would drop precipitously with longer periods. 
</P>
<P>
Except in rare instances, such as those in which an offender's medical problems 
make house arrest a logistically simpler alternative to jail, no local inmate 
serves his entire sentence under electronic surveillance, county officials 
stress. At a minimum, most spend at least several weeks in the overnight 
work-furlough detention center, "to give them a taste of incarceration," Steppe 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
Other than work, there are few other reasons for which a person on the 
electronic detention program may leave their homes. The other exceptions, to be 
cleared in advance with probation officers, include medical and dental 
appointments, meetings with lawyers and a brief weekly grocery store visit. 
Offenders also are forbidden to drink alcoholic beverages and, occasionally, to 
drive while in the program. 
</P>
<P>
Several weeks ago, however, a female offender in the program had one of the 
most valid reasons imaginable for leaving her house: She gave birth to a baby 
on Valentine's Day. 
</P>
<P>
"We call it our first ESP baby," joked probation officer Ann Royer-Hirsch. 
Several days later, mother and child were back within the 150-foot radius of 
the transmitter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can't Trick Computer 
</P>
<P>
The electronic bracelets are water-resistant, shockproof and tamper-proof. 
</P>
<P>
"The computer can't be tricked, and if you remove (the bracelet), you'll be 
caught soon enough," probation supervisor Barkett said. 
</P>
<P>
Probation officers also make periodic unannounced visits and telephone calls to 
the offenders' homes and workplaces to check for violations. Inmates who fail 
to successfully complete the program can be reassigned to a work-furlough 
detention center, honor camp or jail to serve their full sentence -- with no 
credit for the days served at home. 
</P>
<P>
All those factors, however, have not stopped a few inmates from trying to beat 
a system that officials say is unbeatable -- attempts that usually end in comic 
failures. 
</P>
<P>
One offender, for example, offered several suspicious-sounding excuses for why 
his bracelet kept "malfunctioning." Once, he said the device was damaged while 
wrestling with his niece. Another time, the transmitter supposedly was 
accidentally unplugged. Increasingly skeptical officials gave him the benefit 
of the doubt until another unauthorized movement recorded by the computer was 
explained away as the result of a violent love-making session with his 
girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point, I said, 'That's it, get him back in here,' " Barkett said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Ask to Go Back 
</P>
<P>
After a few weeks at home, several offenders, besieged by spousal or family 
demands, have begged officials to put them back into detention facilities, 
while loss of a job or place to live have forced several others back into the 
work-furlough center. The most common reason for the admittedly low number of 
failures, however, has been drug use or alcohol consumption, detected in random 
checks. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the potential pitfalls of the program, however, most offenders who go 
through it give it rave reviews -- particularly considering the alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"At home, you certainly have a bigger realm, so I find it easier on the mind," 
said Jeff, the Mira Mesa man convicted on a drunken-driving charge and now in 
the early stages of a three-month house-detention sentence. "When I was in (the 
work-furlough detention center), I took several books with me and I think I had 
them memorized. Here, I'm around my family and can pretty much do what I would 
otherwise. There are some things I wanted to do -- like seeing the Padres early 
in the year -- that I'll have to give up, but I accept that." 
</P>
<P>
With economics, a successful track record and a supportive Board of Supervisors 
behind him, Steppe said he hopes to find ways to meet the board's charge to 
expand the program this year. He has already suggested, for example, using the 
electronic bracelets to verify that youth gang members are abiding by 
court-imposed curfews. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he cautions against unrealistic expectations for high-tech 
incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a valuable tool, but we have to be careful about how we use it," 
Steppe said. "Let's put it this way: There never will be more people wearing 
these bracelets than are in jail. We shouldn't forget there are good reasons 
for that."

SANEST SOLUTION OF ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the surface, developer Jan Anton's proposal to require environmental impact 
studies on land-use initiatives has some appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Anton's stated goal of bringing some sanity to the initiative process is one we 
can't argue with. November's ballot, with four major growth-control initiatives 
-- all of which lost -- was, indeed, legislative insanity. 
</P>
<P>
And we agree that one of the problems of land-use planning by initiative is 
that it bypasses the analysis and scrutiny of professional planners. An 
environmental impact study before the petitions are circulated might make for 
sounder initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
But the negatives of Anton's proposal outweigh the positives. 
</P>
<P>
His proposal would require the group sponsoring a land-use initiative to pay 
for the environmental impact study. This burden could be prohibitive for 
shoestring groups such as Citizens for Limited Growth, which spent about 
$225,000 on two of the measures on November's ballot. In contrast, the building 
industry spent $2.4 million defeating the measures. 
</P>
<P>
But even if citizens' groups could afford the cost, we doubt that the studies 
would add much sanity to the process. 
</P>
<P>
Voters should not be expected to wade through and evaluate the complexities of 
planning terminology. An environmental analysis would just add to an already 
weighty ballot and would probably exacerbate voter confusion. 
</P>
<P>
Land-use planning should be done by our elected officials, with the assistance 
of their professional planning staffs. Intelligent planning that protects the 
environment and assures adequate public facilities should obviate the need for 
land-use legislation by initiative. And that would be the sanest solution of 
all.

LIKE A PANDORA'S BOX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding your editorial, "The Real Issue Is Students' Health" (Feb. 19), the 
birth control controversy may have clouded the issue. We in Los Angeles know 
experientially that school-based clinics have no silver lining. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando High School (in the L.A. Unified School District), received a 
clinic in November, 1987. About 25% of the predominantly Hispanic 3,000-member 
student body uses its services. This on-campus clinic has been a classic case 
of "what you see is (not) what you get." We were promised comprehensive health 
care. What we got is nothing more than basic first aid and simple, diagnostic 
medical care. In fact, the majority of the time, students are not treated by a 
doctor, but by a nurse practitioner or clinician. 
</P>
<P>
The real kicker about the school-based clinic is that (with the exception of 
dispensing medication), almost two-thirds of its services are already provided 
to students by our approximately $20-million annual student health services 
division budget. The greatest use of the clinic is for sports physicals, which 
have always been provided by our district. 
</P>
<P>
The birth control issue does cloud other equally vital issues. Ripe for debate 
is the unlimited medical malpractice liability, the distraction of the learning 
process that an on-campus clinic causes, real and future cost, as well as the 
duplication of services, both within the school and community. 
</P>
<P>
School-based clinics, when opened, become not what you see, but what you get. 
Just like Pandora's box.

LOCAL CONTROL IS THE KEY ISSUE IN CONTROVERSY OVER SDG&amp;E MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MIKE MADIGAN, Mike Madigan is a senior vice president of Pardee Construction 
Co. and serves on the board of the San Diego County Water Authority. He was an 
aide to former Mayor Pete Wilson.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the history of a city, there are certain special moments when matters of 
great municipal concern are brought before the citizenry for a decision. Such a 
moment is before us now regarding the fate of San Diego's local power utility, 
which is in question because a majority of the San Diego Gas &amp; Electric 
board of directors acquiesced to a buyout bid offered by Southern California 
Edison. 
</P>
<P>
Such special moments demand special attention, and many of San Diego County's 
elected officials and business leaders have seized upon this moment, calling 
for and insisting upon a most careful review of the pluses and minuses of the 
Edison proposal. They also want to examine alternatives, and have asked the San 
Diego County Water Authority, which represents about 95% of the population 
served by SDG&amp;E, to conduct a comprehensive investigation into possible 
municipal ownership of the utility. 
</P>
<P>
These leaders are correct in their insistence on local review. Such issues as 
short- and long-term energy rates, new power plant construction, corporate 
citizenship and the suggestion that San Diego might be asked to subsidize Los 
Angeles' air quality are worthy of our thoughtful consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Rates, for example, are a prime concern to the ratepayers of this community 
and, although much has been promised, such as a 10% residential reduction by 
Edison, the fact is that it is too early to make promises because the facts are 
not yet known. 
</P>
<P>
The same is true of corporate citizenship concerns. SDG&amp;E has been a good 
corporate citizen for a long time. Would new owners, based elsewhere, maintain 
the same quality of corporate citizenship? Edison has promised short-term 
continued support, but two or three years is an exceedingly modest time in the 
lifetime of a city. 
</P>
<P>
Extensive hearings by the California Public Utilities Commission and other 
regulatory bodies will address some of these questions, but only the 
opportunity to evaluate them at the local level is likely to lead to any 
community satisfaction. This local evaluation should also compare ownership by 
Edison with municipal ownership. Would a municipally owned utility result in 
lower rates, as some have suggested, or higher rates? Would it be a better or 
worse corporate citizen? 
</P>
<P>
These are both important questions, but perhaps the issue of greatest concern 
is the matter of local policy direction, management and control. 
</P>
<P>
We have not always seized the moment when issues of local control have awaited 
our review. For example, without sufficient debate we abdicated to Sacramento 
much of the local decision-making responsibility on educational matters with 
the passage of Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
But there also have been many examples in San Diego's history when local 
control of decisions has made a difference. 
</P>
<P>
One of the little-known, but significant, decisions in our municipal history 
was that made by San Diego's Metropolitan Transit Development Board, in its 
very earliest days, to forgo federal funding of a study of fixed guideway 
transit. That decision led directly to the ability of this community to build 
the highly successful San Diego Trolley, which would not likely have been the 
federal decision. 
</P>
<P>
Local control, asserted at a special moment, resulted in a local success. 
</P>
<P>
Another example can be seen with the San Diego Unified Port District. The port 
is building our convention center, one of the cornerstones of both the city's 
downtown revitalization program and of this region's economic development 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
It is also funding an important piece of our light-rail transit system, has 
taken steps to reduce noise at our airport, and may yet provide public art 
along the waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
Would these steps have been taken if control of our port were elsewhere? 
</P>
<P>
Some San Diegans don't think the port is responsive enough. But at least it is 
our port, and we can have an influence on the Board of Port Commissioners' 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Some people argue that, because San Diego County is an energy desert and must 
import its energy from somewhere else, local control of power utility decisions 
is not important. But San Diego also has to import 90% of its water, and I 
would suggest that there is value in having a local water authority. 
</P>
<P>
It is because the authority is under local control that it has mobilized so 
quickly to support the cities of San Diego and Poway and others in the 
important quest for a major water reclamation capability in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Because it is the San Diego County Water Authority, it has always maintained a 
special interest in assuring an adequate and, within the limits of the 
possible, affordable supply of water to agriculture -- an issue of importance 
to this, the 20th most important agricultural economy in the country. Water for 
agriculture is not a commensurately high priority to the city of Los Angeles, a 
fellow member of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which 
supplies our imported water. That's because local agriculture is not a high 
priority to that very urban city. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, affordable agricultural energy rates have been a policy of 
SDG&amp;E, and that's just possibly the case because, as a local utility, it 
understands the importance of agriculture to San Diego. In contrast, Edison 
does not offer a similar agricultural energy program. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidence? I don't know. But it's a concern because, here in San Diego, it's 
an important consideration, and to date the board of SDG&amp;E has represented 
local control. 
</P>
<P>
Water reclamation, the trolley, our convention center. All special moments 
seized and acted on -- locally. 
</P>
<P>
And what of the future? The County Water Authority and the Metropolitan Water 
District are most interested in the potential of sea-water desalination. 
</P>
<P>
There are studies that would suggest that such a program is best carried out 
with waste heat from power plants. Would a locally controlled utility be more 
responsive to this local issue than a utility headquartered and controlled 
somewhere else? It's an important question. 
</P>
<P>
All of the above examples involve government bodies. Is local control less 
important because SDG&amp;E is a private company? 
</P>
<P>
I would argue that it's not, because, as a public utility, SDG&amp;E operates 
under the twin advantages of being a monopoly and holding a long-term franchise 
to do business in San Diego. In return for having granted those two valuable 
considerations, the public has a say in SDG&amp;E decisions through the Public 
Utilities Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Given the momentous nature of the merger decision and the special advantages 
bestowed by the community on SDG&amp;E for these many years, it would seem 
reasonable that SDG&amp;E and its suitor, Edison, would not only allow but 
encourage the most thoughtful public consideration of the future of the utility 
in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
There will, of course, be an appropriate time for SDG&amp;E and Edison to make 
their case to both the public and their elected representatives, but that is 
when all the facts and opportunities of the situation are known, and that is 
still some time off. Unfortunately, some counsel within both corporations seems 
to be aimed at a preemptive strike, rather than thoughtful study. First there 
was the spate of full-page newspaper ads by Edison, then an incomplete survey 
by SDG&amp;E, and now SDG&amp;E has filed suit to halt a study by the County 
Water Authority of a possible government takeover of SDG&amp;E. 
</P>
<P>
These actions have added considerably more heat than light to what should be 
respected by both parties as a very special moment in the life of this 
community. 
</P>
<P>
The timing of these moments is not always of our choosing as, indeed, this one 
is not. But having been chosen, we would be remiss, all of us -- SDG&amp;E and 
Edison included -- if we fail to take this opportunity to consider carefully, 
calmly and dispassionately the future of San Diego's local utility.

REFLECTIONS: 'SO MANY PEOPLE THINK WE'RE BAD PEOPLE. TO ME, THIS IS A VERY 
RESPECTABLE BUSINESS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

There is something very comfortable about the circular, green, felt-covered 
tables, the many chunky glass ashtrays and the thickly cushioned chairs. There 
is something almost soothing about the clink and slap of poker chips being 
tossed into the pot and cards being quickly but gently shuffled. Hanging plants 
and fresh floral arrangements complete the ambiance at the Oasis II Card Room 
on El Cajon Boulevard. Kathy Graham, a thoughtful woman who once taught 
Catholic Sunday school, seems an unlikely manager for a place like the Oasis. 
The 39-year-old Alpine resident said she stumbled into managing the card room, 
but now, after 10 years in the business, both as a dealer and a manager, she 
couldn't imagine doing anything else. Times staff writer Caroline Lemke 
interviewed Graham and Vince Compagnone photographed her. 
</P>
<P>
We're regulated by the Police Department and the City Council, so we can be 
open from 10 in the morning until 12 midnight. We're closed on Sundays. We all 
have to wear badges. We have to go to the Police Department every year and 
renew our badges -- they do a check on us and fingerprint us to make sure we're 
not felons or running from the law. 
</P>
<P>
An average day in here starts at 10 a.m. with a small game, a $20 buy-in game. 
These people have some coffee and doughnuts, and they're ready to play at 10 
o'clock. They have either reserved their seat the day before or they play 
daily. The way we make our money is by charging $1.25 a half hour for the 
rental of the seat. We're not allowed to rake the pot or take a percentage of 
the pot like they do in Vegas. We have center dealers who don't play, they just 
deal cards and make sure the pots are right and make sure no one is cheating. 
</P>
<P>
At night we get a little busier, the games get a little bigger. During the day 
most of our players are elderly people, who, if they didn't come in to this 
place, they would probably vegetate in front of a television and not use their 
minds or have a good time. They meet people. It's an excuse to get dressed, get 
out of the house and come down here and meet their friends. We have some 
elderly people, if they don't come in here for two or three days, we call them 
and make sure they're all right. So, it's a pretty good little social club 
here. It's real nice. 
</P>
<P>
I came here to the Oasis to deal cards. The manager here just quit one day. He 
had put a sign on the door saying he quit and he wouldn't be back. One of the 
dealers called me at home and said, "Kathy, what shall we do?" I said, "Well, 
sell the chips, get the games started and take that sign off the door." Ever 
since that point I became the manager. 
</P>
<P>
It was a difficult transformation for me because I had worked with all these 
people and now I was supposed to be their boss. I thought we could just work 
all together like a co-op, but that doesn't work. Most people said I could do 
it, though, because I'm bossy anyway. 
</P>
<P>
One thing I got out of Catholic school and a Catholic education -- and I might 
have been lucky to have the nuns that I had -- but they told me, whatever I do, 
don't be a hypocrite, and whatever I do, do it well. 
</P>
<P>
That's why I love this business. It's so real here. It is. There's just nothing 
phony here. If you come in and you look sick, they will say, "You look sick. 
What's the matter with you?" And, if you come in and you look cute, they say, 
"God, you look so cute." They don't hold back in here. It's pretty honest in 
here. It's real. 
</P>
<P>
There are times when it's difficult working with people who are losing their 
money. They don't mind spending their money, going out to dinner, but when they 
come in here and lose it and they want to win, sometimes it gets a little 
difficult. It's also frustrating not to be understood or to be misunderstood in 
this business. So many people think we're bad people. To me, this is a very 
respectable business. To a majority of people, they think it's just awful.

STRESS SYMPTOMS FROM WORLD WAR II; 
</P>
<P>
POWS FOUND SUFFERING 40 YEARS LATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
More than 40 years after the end of World War II, former American prisoners of 
war still suffer emotionally and physically from their experiences, 
psychological research indicates. 
</P>
<P>
Former POWs, some now in their 80s, suffer sleep disturbances, irritability, 
guilt, depression, aggressive tendencies and thoughts of suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Physical symptoms reported by the aging former POWs include chest pain, rapid 
heartbeat, numbness in the extremities and numbing weakness. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese-held POWs have a "significantly higher percentage" of physical 
symptoms than German-held POWs, psychologists reported at a recent national 
conference of the American Psychological Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese-held POWs also suffered higher percentages of depression due to 
loneliness, nightmares, thoughts of suicide and prolonged helplessness, the 
researchers reported. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Traumatic Stress' 
</P>
<P>
"There are clear indicators that some veterans continue to experience traumatic 
stress associated with their capture and POW status," said Thomas Miller, a 
psychologist at the Veterans Administration Medical Center and the University 
of Kentucky in Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
Miller and his associates studied 86 former POWs to assess current adjustments 
to post-military life and to determine their susceptibility to post-traumatic 
stress disorder. 
</P>
<P>
Another study yielding similar results was conducted at the Veterans 
Administration Medical Center at the Medical College of Georgia in Augusta, Ga. 
That study involved 71 former POWs, predominantly from World War II and ranging 
in age from 56 to 80. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surprising Results 
</P>
<P>
The Augusta study, headed by psychologist Shelby Sperr, also revealed what he 
called the "surprising finding" that the duration of imprisonment did not cause 
significant differences in the results, although this might have been thought 
to be a prime stress factor. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Stenger of the American Ex-prisoners of War Assn. said, "If you go 
through those kinds of deprivations, you continue throughout the rest of your 
life to have damage." 
</P>
<P>
Stenger said the belief that "when it's over, it's over" is a myth. "Those in 
the profession realize it's not over. The symptoms recur later in life." 
</P>
<P>
Some former POWs functioned reasonably well throughout life "but are now 
falling apart," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proud of Medals 
</P>
<P>
Stenger said most POWs are not ashamed that they were taken prisoner, adding 
that a POW medal recently authorized by Congress had given former prisoners a 
tremendous morale boost. 
</P>
<P>
The deprivations suffered by World War II prisoners and American prisoners in 
other recent wars is nothing new, Stenger said. He noted that during the 
American Revolution, the British kept American prisoners on a ship in New York 
Harbor while dysentery and smallpox killed them at a rate of 10 a day. 
</P>
<P>
Stenger said that based on data supplied by the Defense Department, National 
Archives, National Research Council and other sources, the United States has 
78,264 living POWs from World Wars I and II, the Korean and the Vietnam wars. A 
total of 142,227 Americans were captured during those wars and 17,026 died in 
captivity.

SERVICEMEN LEARN CULTURAL PITFALLS; 
</P>
<P>
WHEN A THUMBS UP WON'T DO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

HURLBURT FIELD, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The best advice to Americans abroad is to keep your hands in your pockets, lest 
you be gravely misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, a thumbs up might mean "OK" or "right on" to you, but it's an 
obscene gesture in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
And the "A-OK" sign of the forefinger and thumb in a circle can get you into 
all kinds of trouble. It means money in Japan, but in France it means you think 
someone is a "zero" and in Malta it's an invitation to a homosexual act. 
</P>
<P>
That's why Capt. Mike Rafferty has his hands full teaching a cross-cultural 
communications course at this Air Force base in the Florida Panhandle. He is 
trying to avoid misunderstandings when American servicemen teach foreign 
military personnel the intricacies of U.S. military equipment and procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Just when you want to deliver a compliment to a foreign student, you might be 
picking a fight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Specific Courses 
</P>
<P>
The five-day course is taught at the Air Force Special Operations School. The 
school also offers more-specific courses for personnel being sent to particular 
parts of the world such as Latin America or Africa, but Rafferty's class gives 
troops an insight into cultural differences around the world. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, patting children on the head may be a sign of endearment to an 
American, but in some Asian cultures, where the top of the head is considered 
the home of the soul, it's an insult. 
</P>
<P>
"In most other cultures the development has been different," Rafferty said, 
noting that many have changed little over thousands of years. "In the United 
States, the emphasis is on individual rights. In other cultures it's the 
survival of the group that's important." 
</P>
<P>
This difference shows up in the classroom. Individualistic Americans are taught 
to ask questions, figure things out for themselves and that their instructors 
don't know everything, said Rafferty, whose home is in Stockton, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Don't Ask Questions 
</P>
<P>
In many non-Western countries, students learn by rote and don't ask questions 
or acknowledge that they failed to understand something because they don't want 
to be considered different from the rest of the group. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a saying in this country that 'the squeaky wheel gets the grease,' " 
Rafferty said. "In Asia, the saying is 'the nail that stands up gets hammered 
down.' " 
</P>
<P>
The individual competitiveness of Americans is one of the first things foreign 
students notice, Rafferty said. They often see it as a negative factor that 
takes away from the importance of the group. 
</P>
<P>
Other countries tend to stress group competition, perhaps refined to an 
ultimate by the Japanese, Rafferty said. 
</P>
<P>
The group emphasis also makes the family more significant in many countries. In 
the Middle East, for example, elders are respected, revered and sought out for 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Differences 
</P>
<P>
Time and space are other important differences. 
</P>
<P>
In Arab, African and Latin American countries, arriving 30 minutes or more 
after a meeting is scheduled to start may be considered "on time," whereas in 
the United States it would be insulting to show up so late, Rafferty said. On 
the other hand, a Swiss-German would get there early. 
</P>
<P>
Although Americans feel uncomfortable when others invade their space, many 
foreigners, particularly Arabs and Latin Americans, like to get up close and 
personal. 
</P>
<P>
When that happens to an American at a social function with foreigners, he is 
likely to back away, but the foreigner again will close the gap, Rafferty said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a little dance that goes on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Same-sex touching also is common in the Middle East and Asia, where it has none 
of the sexual connotation it has in America. 
</P>
<P>
Rafferty recalled that while attending the Squadron Officer School at Maxwell 
Air Force Base in Montgomery, Ala., he was a good friend of an officer from 
Thailand. They played on the same soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
While dressed in their soccer shorts, they were sitting in the stands and 
talking when the visitor reached over and put his hand on Rafferty's bare 
thigh. 
</P>
<P>
"That was real uncomfortable for me," Rafferty said. "Everybody in the stands 
behind me was laughing, but it wasn't a problem." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Favor Eye Contact 
</P>
<P>
Americans also don't like too much direct eye contact, particularly between men 
and women. Latinos and Arabs, who share some cultural similarities because of 
the 700-year Moorish occupation of Spain, like eye contact. 
</P>
<P>
"They feel they can tell a lot about an individual if they can look into his 
eyes," Rafferty said. 
</P>
<P>
Some foreigners get into trouble in the United States when strangers interpret 
their stares as a challenge, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Foreigners and Americans often have stereotyped views of each other that are 
untrue. 
</P>
<P>
The most commonly held view of the United States is that it is a great melting 
pot. As a result, some foreign visitors are surprised when they discover 
exceptions to racial, ethnic and sexual equality.

Just as Girl Scouts do anywhere in America, these 15 girls wear badges embossed 
with the official scouting emblem. They hold up three fingers, vow to help 
others and to serve God and country. And just as their fellow Scouts do, they 
sell lots of cookies. 
</P>
<P>
But they also play the dan tranh (a string instrument), make cha gio (egg 
rolls) and perform the mua non (a hat dance). 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to Troop 2588 of Canoga Park, the first all-Vietnamese Girl Scout 
chapter in Los Angeles County, whose leader had to assure skittish parents that 
she would conduct meetings mostly in Vietnamese before they would allow their 
daughters to join. 
</P>
<P>
The troop of 11- to 19-year-olds started three months ago, more than a year 
after the San Fernando Valley Girl Scout Council planted the idea with Hao 
Doan, coordinator of the Southeast Asian Community Center in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wooing of Parents 
</P>
<P>
It took some wooing of parents to get their blessings, mostly because 
Vietnamese families tend to be protective of their daughters, troop leader 
Huong-Mai Elliott said.

The troop -- along with another Vietnamese troop in Orange County -- is one of 
a small number of Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. chapters nationwide formed for 
specific ethnic groups. Such troops have their critics, who say that one 
purpose of the Girl Scouts is to expose youths to diverse viewpoints, 
backgrounds and cultures. 
</P>
<P>
Doan said that he just wanted to help serve the Valley's about 6,000 Vietnamese 
youths and groom leaders for the area's growing Vietnamese population. Doan 
said he sees the Valley as becoming a major home for the Vietnamese, as Orange 
County and the San Gabriel Valley are now. 
</P>
<P>
"The Vietnamese family system is very strong," Doan said. "But to survive in 
America, we need skills to work with others beyond the family -- leadership 
skills, organizing skills." 
</P>
<P>
Elliott, who lived in Vietnam and Singapore before coming to the United States 
in 1979, said the Canoga Park chapter will be a valuable bridge between the 
American and Vietnamese cultures. 
</P>
<P>
Try as they might, Vietnamese parents cannot insulate and control their 
children in America as they did in their homeland, Elliott said. Social and 
family traditions in Vietnam keep daughters submissive, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The ones that don't listen to their parents get laughed at and are shamed. The 
children might not be so curious because everyone's the same, everybody is like 
everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
But here, they see American classmates dating and performing fewer chores at 
home, Elliott said. And parental authority is challenged when the parents who 
speak Vietnamese in the home must turn to their children to deal with the 
English-speaking world. 
</P>
<P>
"So if they're to be exposed, you may as well expose them in the right way," 
Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
That's where Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. steps in. 
</P>
<P>
The familiar scouting pledge teaches girls to help others, be honest, cheerful 
and respectful. 
</P>
<P>
And when Troop 2588 met recently at Canoga Park High School, the girls recited 
that promise -- in English, along with the Pledge of Allegiance -- before 
turning to their native language to chat about cookie sales, an upcoming 
Disneyland outing and an invitation to a fashion show. 
</P>
<P>
A play and Vietnamese folk dances were among activities the girls were planning 
for an appearance this month at the Southeast Asian Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
Thanh Nguyen, 15, who was designated playwright, explained the plot this way: 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be about Girls Scouts helping with family problems. It will be very 
dramatic, they'll cry. One girl -- she's like New Wave and stuff -- her parents 
don't let her do anything. One time, her parents are not home, and her bad 
friend calls and asks her to go to a party. She's scared, but her bad friend 
makes her go." 
</P>
<P>
When the parents discover that their daughter has disobeyed them, they lock her 
out of the house. "So she's walking around all night. She sees one of her good 
friends, who's a Girl Scout." The scout pleads the girl's case to the parents, 
who relent. The girl, of course, joins the Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
The plot is not entirely fictional. Nguyen, who came to the United States in 
1987, said that her mother "doesn't let me go out a lot, but she understands 
that if she's so strict, I might get bad, I might sneak out." 
</P>
<P>
Coaxing the parents to let their daughters join the troop took plenty of good 
will. Elliott, a volunteer at the Southeast Asian Community Center, had helped 
some of the adults with translations or trips to doctors' offices. In that way, 
she eventually won them over. 
</P>
<P>
"I said to parents that here they cannot protect the child by keeping them at 
home. If you keep them at home, they might be frustrated, leave home and end up 
on the streets, on drugs, with boys or gangs," Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott's visit to high school senior Kim Vu's father persuaded him to let her 
join, albeit with the warning, " 'Always remember you're Vietnamese,' " Vu 
recalls. 
</P>
<P>
"I have so much responsibility," said Vu, who lives in Northridge. In addition 
to household chores, she takes care of five younger brothers and sisters and is 
trying to get ready for college. 
</P>
<P>
Running a Vietnamese troop has its unusual demands. The girls' membership forms 
had to be translated from English so parents could read and sign them. Elliott 
generally speaks Vietnamese at meetings, because she doesn't want to upset the 
parents. "I don't want them to say, 'Huong-Mai is Americanizing my daughter.' " 
</P>
<P>
And she proceeds cautiously in introducing social events, believing that it's 
too early to propose a troop slumber party to the parents. 
</P>
<P>
Troop 2588 reflects the changing nature of the 77-year-old Girl Scouts of the 
U.S.A., which is constantly fighting its image as an organization for white, 
middle-class girls who sell cookies and go camping, said Barbara Smith, a Girl 
Scouts' spokeswoman in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen percent of the 2.3 million Girl Scouts nationwide are minorities, and 
the organization's goal is to increase that to 17% by September, Smith said. In 
the Valley, more than 25% -- or 2,320 -- of Girl Scout members are minorities, 
said Kathy Andersen, a Valley Scout field executive. 
</P>
<P>
Most of these girls are in mixed troops. Troops of members from just one ethnic 
background, such as Elliott's, are exceptions among the estimated 184,000 
troops nationwide, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Troop 2588 and Orange County's all-Vietnamese troop, there is an 
all-Armenian troop in the Valley, a Laotian Hmong troop in Minnesota and a 
Haitian chapter in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Other Los Angeles-area Girl Scout officials said that they prefer to encourage 
ethnic diversity in their troops. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't try to intentionally set up all-one-ethnic troops," said Julia 
Weiman, executive director of the Greater Long Beach Girl Scout Council. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the things that's so good about Girl Scouts -- you get to meet 
girls and families of so many different backgrounds, heritages and languages," 
said Mina Post, a spokeswoman at the Angeles Council, which covers Los Angeles 
and some western and northern Los Angeles County suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
But many Troop 2588 members said they treasure the time they spend together 
chatting in Vietnamese and planning to make native dishes such as cha gio to 
sell near Vietnamese shops. 
</P>
<P>
"At my age, I learn fast the American way. I have lots of American friends," 
said Loan Hong, 16. "But I just don't want to forget where I came from." 
</P>
<P>
Gerry Zelenka, who supervises Orange County's troop of 13 Vietnamese, said her 
girls meet for language and culture lessons as well as badge work and 
traditional scouting activities. 
</P>
<P>
"The ideal is to have girls mainstreamed," Zelenka said. "However, it does meet 
the need at this time because the parents so much want the girls to retain some 
knowledge of their culture." 
</P>
<P>
Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. has no policy on whether a troop should be tailored 
to a specific ethnic group, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
But San Fernando Valley Girl Scout Council officials stressed that Troop 2588 
is not isolated because the girls are learning scouting values and mores that 
are universal. 
</P>
<P>
"They're selling Girl Scout cookies. What can be more traditional than that?" 
asked Robert Dyer, executive director of the Valley council. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, Elliott said, the girls are learning to "increase their voices" 
without necessarily Americanizing them. 
</P>
<P>
And a stronger voice is what the Valley's growing population of 15,000 
Vietnamese needs, particularly since it is scattered from Canoga Park to 
Glendale and is less visible as a result, Doan said. 
</P>
<P>
There are some traditions that Elliott would rather see fade away. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a Vietnamese saying: A girl is like a raindrop. The lucky one will 
fall on the roof of the palace, the unlucky one will fall in a puddle of mud. 
That's the fate of women." 
</P>
<P>
But here, "I'd like them to decide their fate," Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
"If it doesn't work, they can fix it. Silent suffering in Vietnam is viewed as 
courage and maturity. But here, you need to be more assertive. 
</P>
<P>
"If you just study and don't talk or ask questions, teachers think you don't 
care," Elliott said. "And you can't just be shy and smile and get a job. You 
have to speak up." 
</P>

PLAN WOULD STREAMLINE DOMESTIC LITIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 18 years presiding over the family law department of Torrance Superior 
Court, Commissioner Abraham Gorenfeld said he has seen too much time and money 
wasted as divorcing couples struggle for the upper hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd been on the (family court) assembly line -- 25 matters in the morning and 
another 25 in the afternoon -- for 18 years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But it was not until last year, while he was convalescing after prostate 
surgery, that he had time to survey "the big picture" and "knew the system 
didn't make sense. So Gorenfeld summarized his thoughts on simplifying divorce 
in an article published in December in the Los Angeles Daily Journal, a legal 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The article, "The Future of Family Law," suggested that lawyers should be 
removed from divorce cases and replaced with neutral mediators, who would 
settle issues ranging from division of community property to child support 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
Gorenfeld felt better use could be made of the nearly $1.5 million the county 
spends each year to operate its 27 family law courts and for the fees paid by 
husbands and wives to their lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
The article has drawn scorn from divorce lawyers -- who say Gorenfeld's plan 
would not protect the rights of husbands and wives -- and potential support 
from Los Angeles County Supervisor Deane Dana, who has asked the county staff 
to study it. 
</P>
<P>
Couples who file for divorce in California must have their settlements approved 
by a Superior Court judge. Court approval is merely a formality when the 
settlement terms are not in dispute, but contested divorces can drag on for 
months -- or even years -- with unsettled issues being decided in court. 
</P>
<P>
In his article, Gorenfeld proposed that: 
</P>
<P>
All couples in the state filing for divorce should have their cases heard by a 
court-appointed mediator, rather than a judge. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers who would be appointed as mediators would be permitted to use 
common sense in deciding what information to hear and not be limited to the 
traditional rules of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Financial experts and family therapists would advise mediators, suggesting how 
to split assets between couples and how to provide for custody of children and 
visitation. 
</P>
<P>
The mediators would help couples resolve cases. If unsuccessful, mediators 
would set the terms of divorces. Their decisions would be binding. 
</P>
<P>
Review by a Superior Court judge would be permitted in some cases, including 
those involving disputed child custody and where more than $50,000 in community 
property is at stake. Also, spouses would continue to appear before a judge, as 
they do now, to have the terms of the divorce enforced. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lower Costs Cited 
</P>
<P>
Gorenfeld said the proposal would streamline divorce, cutting the expense of 
both husbands and wives hiring lawyers, appraisers and therapists. The 
mediators would work with one set of unbiased appraisers and therapists, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Eliminating the traditional rules of evidence would prevent lengthy delays and 
legal posturing that usually cloud the issues, Gorenfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
The 74-year-old commissioner said mediators, also called conciliators, already 
have shown their usefulness in settling one aspect of divorce -- child custody 
and visitation. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Superior Court began mandatory mediation of such disputes in 
1978. Mediators last year resolved 64% of the 6,901 cases that came before 
them, said Hugh McIsaac, the county's director of Family Court Services. The 
unsettled cases go to court. 
</P>
<P>
County officials said it costs the taxpayers $3,237 a day to run each of the 27 
family law courts, compared to the $462 a day for each of the 19 mediators and 
accompanying overhead. 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, Gorenfeld's plan would extend the domain of mediators from 
decisions about child custody to rulings on alimony, community property and 
child support payments. 
</P>
<P>
Presently social workers are assigned by the county courts to mediate child 
custody cases. Under Gorenfeld's plan, lawyers would mediate disputes over 
community property, support payments and alimony. Mediators would ensure that 
both parties in a divorce would have their legal rights protected, Gorenfeld 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, the county estimated that child custody mediation saved the taxpayers 
nearly $150,000. Last year, child custody mediators settled five times as many 
cases as a decade ago at an undetermined savings to the county, McIsaac said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opponents' Views 
</P>
<P>
Several members of the Los Angeles County Bar Assn. said Gorenfeld's proposal 
oversimplifies divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Joseph Taback, former chairman of the bar association's family law 
section, said one lawyer working as a mediator cannot serve the interests of 
two opposing parties. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's wrong to have one lawyer (or mediator) serving two clients," 
Taback said. "And I don't think that two lawyers necessarily means that it has 
to be more adversarial." 
</P>
<P>
Other lawyers said Gorenfeld is too quick to do away with rules of evidence 
that are part of the law to prevent irrelevant and unfair factors from figuring 
in a divorce settlement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hearsay Considerations 
</P>
<P>
They said, for instance, that Gorenfeld's proposal would permit mediators to 
consider hearsay evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"In a child support case a wife might say, 'So-and-so says she knows (the 
husband) has a second job and she always sees him with $100 bills in his 
pocket,' " said one South Bay lawyer, who appears frequently in Gorenfeld's 
court. "That's total hearsay." 
</P>
<P>
Such second-hand statements are damaging because the person who claims to have 
seen the $100 bills is not in court to be cross-examined, the lawyer said. Yet 
she said an inexperienced mediator, not restricted by the rules of evidence, 
might use such testimony to increase the husband's child-support payments. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Lichtig, chairman of the family law section, acknowledged that the 
courts are overburdened but said that was not reason enough to throw out the 
established system for divorces. 
</P>
<P>
He said the executive committee for family law will meet later this month to 
consider offering a response to Gorenfeld's ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Another bar association member said: "There is a lot of groundswell in 
opposition to this article. A lot of people think it's contrary to mainstream 
beliefs on the rights of litigants."

SAN PEDRO ARTS CENTER PINS HOPES ON DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The struggling Angels Gate Cultural Center has a new executive director -- and 
new hope that it can become financially stable and attract more support from 
the San Pedro community. 
</P>
<P>
Will Hipps, a 47-year-old painter, sculptor and photographer with experience 
building art programs and galleries from the ground up, took over at Angels 
Gate two months ago. He replaces Roberta McFaden Miller, who resigned for 
personal reasons last September after a stormy four-year tenure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'One Day at a Time' 
</P>
<P>
In an interview last week, Hipps said he is taking his new job "one day at a 
time, with my eye on the future." 
</P>
<P>
"What gives me confidence is that I've gone in where there was a lot less 
support from the community and a lot less facilities." 
</P>
<P>
Yet he also noted that "in a way, it's a little bit more difficult here. I'm 
not exactly starting from scratch. There is a history I have to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
That history has been troubled, particularly during the past 18 months, when 
the arts organization faced threats of lawsuits from members, wiring problems 
that resulted in the closing of its theater, and debts of as much as $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, some charged that Miller, who was praised for being hard-working 
and energetic, was also too dogmatic and drove away talented artists. Even 
George Beck, president of the center's board of directors and a constant 
supporter of Miller, conceded last week that her leaving may have done the 
center good. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was time," Beck said. "She was there for four years and she gave a 
lot and she burned herself out, and I think she realizes that, too." 
</P>
<P>
Miller herself said when she left that the center was on a sound footing and 
ready for a change of leadership. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Center Has Reduced Debt 
</P>
<P>
Beck said that by not having to pay the salary of an executive director for 
four months the center has reduced its debt to about $5,000. And, he said, "we 
told him (Hipps) that the No. 1 priority is to get our income to match our 
expenses." 
</P>
<P>
Beck said Hipps, who was chosen from a field of 30 applicants, "seems to be 
very much what we needed. . . . We needed somebody that had a professional 
background in the management of art and that had a good background in the, 
shall I say, operational end of art." 
</P>
<P>
For all this, Beck acknowledged, the new director is not being paid much -- 
just $400 a week, with the possibility of a raise if he can increase the 
center's income. Miller made about $600 a week. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hipps does not have a formal contract with the center, he said he 
views his commitment as long term, possibly 15 to 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit cultural center, founded in 1981, holds art classes and provides 
studio space to artists in a complex of former military barracks at Angels Gate 
Park. The barracks are owned by the city, which is about to approve a new 
three-year lease with the center. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the center's founders proposed demolishing the old barracks and 
building a new center with private money. But no serious fund raising was ever 
done. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, that effort must begin in earnest. A new master plan for Angels 
Gate Park, scheduled to be implemented in three years, calls for moving the 
cultural center to a three-acre site elsewhere in the park. The center must 
come up with money to build a new complex there or have the barracks moved to 
the new site. 
</P>
<P>
Beck said the board is looking to Hipps to "take a leading part" in efforts to 
raise money for a building fund, and would also like him to help the center 
attract new students and artists. 
</P>
<P>
Hipps' varied background has taken him across the country, from North Carolina 
to Georgia, Massachusetts, Texas, New York and, most recently, San Francisco 
and Los Angeles, where he now lives in San Pedro, a short walk from Angels 
Gate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Started a Cooperative 
</P>
<P>
In Dallas, he created the visual arts program at the University of Texas and 
founded a cooperative in which he and other artists bought a 26,000-square-foot 
warehouse and converted it into 14 studios and a gallery. 
</P>
<P>
In Provincetown, Mass., he served as director of visual arts at the Fine Arts 
Work Center, which provides fellowships for 10 artists and writers each year. 
Over the long term, Hipps said, he would like to see a similar program at 
Angels Gate. 
</P>
<P>
Over the short term, he said he intends to concentrate on improving the 
center's class schedule and its buildings. That pleases Los Angeles Department 
of Recreation and Parks officials, who had run-ins with Miller when substandard 
electrical wiring was discovered in one of the cultural center buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm extremely happy with the guy," said Robert Brown, the department's Angels 
Gate supervisor. "Before, when I talked about codes and enforcement it would 
fall on deaf ears." 
</P>
<P>
Even March Beagle, a center member who has been its staunchest critic, was 
optimistic about Hipps and said she has noticed changes since his arrival. "The 
whole atmosphere is much more constructive and open," she said.

REDONDO RUNOFF CANDIDATE MAY ASK FOR RECOUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Valerie Dombrowski, who missed an outright victory by only four votes in 
Redondo Beach's municipal elections Tuesday, says she may ask for a recount of 
the ballots cast for her and opponent Terry Ward in the District 4 City Council 
race. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm seriously contemplating it," she said Friday after an infusion of 20 
disputed ballots in the city's vote totals failed to push her over the 
50%-plus-1 mark needed to avoid a May 16 runoff and be declared the winner. 
</P>
<P>
Election officials added the ballots after the county registrar-recorder's 
office verified the signatures. They were among 24 ballots pulled aside by 
polling place inspectors, mostly because the names of the voters did not appear 
on precinct rosters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conferring With Backers 
</P>
<P>
Dombrowski said she would confer with her supporters over the weekend, 
particularly about the cost of a recount, and then make her decision after the 
election canvass is completed and accepted by the council Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
City Clerk John Oliver estimated the recount cost for District 4 at $250. The 
cost would be paid by the person requesting the recount, unless it changes the 
outcome of the election, in which case the city pays, he said. He said such 
requests must be made within five calendar days of the election certification. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver said four of the 20 disputed ballots were cast in District 4, with 
Dombrowski and Ward each receiving two. The new count left her with 467 votes 
and Ward with 419. 
</P>
<P>
"Four votes is awfully close," Ward said. "I wouldn't blame Val if she asks for 
a recount." 
</P>
<P>
But if the runoff is still on, Ward added, "I'll be out there working hard to 
win in May. I've learned a lot, and with a little change in strategy, I think 
I've got a real good shot at winning." 
</P>
<P>
In the school board race for two seats, the 20 disputed ballots left incumbent 
Howard Huizing an unofficial winner with nine votes more than third-place 
challenger Andrew Deliman. That was a gain of one vote for Huizing. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Rebecca Sargent easily won reelection to the other seat on the 
Redondo Beach City School District board. 
</P>
<P>
Deliman said Friday that he does not plan to ask for a recount since he thinks 
it "highly unlikely" that the election computers made enough mistakes to 
reverse the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
The disputed ballots did not affect the District 2 council race, which will 
continue into the runoff with incumbent Kay Horrell facing challenger Michael 
F. Ford, or the mayoral runoff between candidates Brad Parton and Frank 
Bostrom.

VAN NUYS DRIVER KILLED IN ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Van Nuys man driving a pickup truck was killed early Saturday when the truck 
slammed into the rear of a parked semi-tractor-trailer, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Edward Doss, 36, of Van Nuys was pronounced dead at the scene shortly 
after 3:15 a.m. when his 1976 pickup struck the tractor-trailer parked on 
Louise Avenue near Archwood Street. 
</P>
<P>
A passenger in the pickup, Edwin Whitespear, 22, of Van Nuys, was taken to 
Northridge Hospital Medical Center and later transferred to County-USC Medical 
Center where he was treated for severe alcoholic intoxication, a head injury 
and a broken leg, police said.

MAN KILLED WHILE STALLED ON FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California Highway Patrol officials were investigating Saturday a traffic 
accident that killed a 21-year-old San Diego resident, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis Velazquez was standing in front of his car, disabled in the fast lane on 
southbound Interstate 5 north of E Street in Chula Vista, when another car 
smashed into his. 
</P>
<P>
The second car, driven by Jan Chabot, 22, of Imperial Beach, was traveling 70 
m.p.h. when it rear-ended Velazquez's car about 3:20 a.m. Saturday, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the impact, Velazquez's car ran over him, authorities said. He was 
pronounced dead on arrival at UC San Diego Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Chabot was taken to Chula Vista Community Hospital with minor injuries.

SCRIPPS HOSPITAL PROGRAM; 
</P>
<P>
STUDENTS LEARN OF CAREER CHOICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although some are lured by stories of the gore in the pathology lab, the chance 
to learn firsthand about doctors is the major reason dozens of students at 
Chula Vista Junior High School sign up for a special program at neighboring 
Scripps Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Once a month, a group of students walks next door to "shadow" professionals -- 
pediatricians, pathologists, pharmacists, accountants -- as they work, 
one-on-one. The 12- to 15-year-old students also are introduced to careers that 
do not necessarily require a college education, such as food preparation. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't think of it as a field trip, which students usually regard as a 
license to screw up," said Rick Benedict, the school's outreach adviser. "The 
kids are thinking of the hospital as part of the school." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Return Trips 
</P>
<P>
Benedict said many students who have participated in the school-hospital 
partnership, which began in December, are signing up to go again. 
</P>
<P>
Eighth-grader Reagan Lefeber, 13, toured the radiology lab and learned X-ray 
techniques on her second visit to Scripps last month. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's talking about the trips," she said. "The people at school who are 
selected to go are really excited. I was happy when I found out I could go 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a really good thing the hospital is doing because a lot of people 
I know want to be doctors, and it's interesting to them how the hospital works. 
I'd like to be an anesthesiologist or a pediatrician." Because of the trips, 
many pupils have been inspired to consider a medical career, teachers said. 
</P>
<P>
By adopting Chula Vista Junior High, Scripps Memorial Hospital joined a host of 
businesses participating in the county's Partnership in Education program, 
which began in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Although the goal is to allow all the school's students to participate, the 
Scripps program targets seventh- to ninth-graders who are considered to be 
working below their potential. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Firsthand Look 
</P>
<P>
One seventh-grader, described by Benedict as "a good kid but not up to snuff," 
tagged along with a pathologist last month. The student was particularly 
attentive when the pathologist opened a lab drawer containing a human brain and 
began to describe its regions. 
</P>
<P>
In a welcome twist, Benedict recalled, the student was fascinated with the 
explanation. The beauty of what is happening, Benedict said, is that students 
are learning without the elements that some dread most: classes and textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
First impressions sometimes focus on the glances at brains and refrigerated 
limbs, administrators acknowledge. But the long-lasting value, teachers and 
counselors said, is sparking students' interest in one of the hospital's many 
occupations -- medicine, business management, office work, food preparation or 
nursing. 
</P>
<P>
Although hospital officials at first were hesitant to allow more than a few 
students to visit at one time, groups of 15 now travel to the hospital once a 
month in lieu of their science courses. 
</P>
<P>
"We figured, we've got this hospital next door with all these resources -- we 
decided to get the kids involved in the community," said Benedict, who together 
with a fellow counselor recommended the Scripps' partnership to the principal, 
Ramon Leyba. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Trip for Many 
</P>
<P>
For some students, the trips are an opportunity to visit a hospital for the 
first time, at least since birth. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had kids that have never been in a hospital before, so we hope the 
visits will reduce the stigma hospitals usually have," Benedict said. 
</P>
<P>
"One kid got stomach cramps. He'd never been to a hospital before -- he thought 
it was only a place for dying people to go. It scared the hell out of him." 
</P>
<P>
The partnership goes both ways. Students in two classes are raising money -- 
more than $200 so far -- to help equip a new nursery that opened recently at 
the hospital. The hospital now can treat up to 10 critically ill infants that 
would otherwise have to be taken to Children's Hospital or UC San Diego Medical 
Center.

MORNING BRIEFING: PROPOSED ROOFTOP CLUB UPSETS CUBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chicago, having resolved the great night baseball debate, has come up with a 
new cause to ignite fans on the city's North Side. And the latest brouhaha 
doesn't make Donald Grenesko, president of the Cubs, any happier than the last. 
</P>
<P>
At issue are the team's traditional rooftop rooters, and a controversial 
proposal to launch a private club atop a building across from Wrigley Field 
that would sell seats for baseball games. 
</P>
<P>
Cub fans set up chairs and bars and television sets on other rooftops to watch 
games, but members of the planned club would have to pay for their seats. 
These, presumably, would compete with the Cubs' 65 new skyboxes already sold 
out for this season at prices ranging from $45,000 to $65,000. 
</P>
<P>
"They are clearly stealing our product," Grenesko told the Chicago Sun-Times. 
"We strenuously object to it. If they can do it, then the people next door can 
do it, and the people next door to them and the people next door to them." 
</P>
<P>
Cubs II: The other side: North Side lawyer Gilbert Liss, a partner in the 
rooftop project, saw it another way. 
</P>
<P>
"They are saying that 50 people, added to the 40,000 who are already there, are 
going to cause an undue burden to the neighborhood," Liss told the Sun-Times. 
"Well, that's ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Grenesko is not pleased. On the other hand. Mr. Grenesko features the 
rooftops in (TV) advertising for the Chicago Cubs and the happy fans." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia: Thirty-two teams will be awarded berths in the field for the 52nd 
National Invitation Tournament today. Who won last year's tournament? 
</P>
<P>
He left it where?The Detroit Red Wings didn't do defenseman Gilbert Delorme any 
favors by trading Jim Pavese to the Hartford Whalers last week. 
</P>
<P>
When Delorme stepped off the plane at Detroit's Metropolitan Airport on his 
arrival home from a five-game trip, he started looking for his car. And 
looking. And looking. 
</P>
<P>
Seems Pavese had parked the car for Delorme, then left for Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
Unbeaten and untied: The University of Washington is off to the slowest start 
in the school's baseball history, even though the Huskies haven't lost a game. 
</P>
<P>
The team was rained out or snowed out in 15 of its first 16 games on the 
54-game schedule. 
</P>
<P>
More memorable trades: Follow this chain of events and you, too, could be a 
general manager in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the Philadelphia Flyers couldn't agree to a contract with defenseman 
Brad McCrimmon. 
</P>
<P>
The Flyers dealt McCrimmon to the Calgary Flames for first- and third-round 
picks. 
</P>
<P>
This year, they packaged the No. 1 pick from Calgary together with their own 
No. 1 and obtained goaltender Ken Wregget from the Toronto Maple Leafs. 
</P>
<P>
The net result: The Flyers traded McCrimmon, a second-team All-Star last 
season, and their No. 1 pick this summer for the sometimes-No. 1 goaltender on 
a perennial loser and a No. 3 draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
Wregget's main job is to give Ron Hextall a breather every now and then. Mostly 
then. He's still recovering from mononucleosis and hasn't played in a month. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Connecticut won last year's NIT, defeating Ohio State, 72-67, in 
the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: On winning, golfer Nancy Lopez says: "Finishing second or third 
doesn't do anything for me. The money is great, but winning is what it's all 
about. The thrill of making a 10-footer on the final hole and having the hair 
stand up on the back of your neck. That's exciting."

LENDL AND EDBERG STRUGGLE TO WINS IN ARIZONA TOURNAMENT SEMIFINALS

Top-seeded Ivan Lendl and second-seeded Stefan Edberg scored difficult 
semifinal victories Saturday and will meet in today's final of the $415,000 
Eagle tennis tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, the top-ranked men's player in the world, eliminated fifth-seeded Emilio 
Sanchez, 6-2, 3-6, 6-3, in a 2-hour 21-minute match that ended in twilight. 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier match on the outdoor hardcourts of the Scottsdale Princess Hotel, 
Edberg struggled to beat unseeded Amos Mansdorf of Israel, 6-7, 6-4, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg, the 1988 Wimbledon champion currently ranked fourth in the world, got 
his powerful serve working midway through the 1-hour 52-minute match. 
</P>
<P>
"It took a while before I finally came through," Edberg said after playing just 
his fifth match since suffering a back injury at the Australian Open in late 
January. "The back was no problem. I was serving well all day. Mansdorf played 
well the first two sets. I broke him twice in the last set, and when I broke 
him to go up 3-2, I knew I had him. He mentally got tired after that." 
</P>
<P>
Mansdorf, 23, seemed in control until Edberg broke him for the first time in 
the final game of the second set.

WOMEN'S TENNIS TOURNAMENT AT INDIAN WELLS;

BYRNE UPSETS MANDLIKOVA, MALEEVA BEATS SUKOVA TO REACH FINAL

INDIAN WELLS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here in the vicinity of Frank Sinatra Drive and Bob Hope Drive, it has been 
Jenny Byrne's week. At least so far. 
</P>
<P>
The only person standing between Byrne and victory in the $250,000 Virginia 
Slims of Indian Wells is Manuela Maleeva, whose chance of winning was wrapped 
in ice Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The final that no one could have expected will take place today on the 
sun-baked Stadium Court at Hyatt Grand Champions. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne got to the final with yet another upset victory, this one over Hana 
Mandlikova. 
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't have the sparkle," Mandlikova said. 
</P>
<P>
The snap and the crackle was supplied by Byrne, the 22-year-old Australian who 
had pop in her racket. Byrne survived a set point when Mandlikova inexplicably 
fanned on a service return. 
</P>
<P>
"She really missed an opportunity there," said Byrne, who then moved on easily 
to post a 7-6, 6-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne wore a paisley headband in her match, but it was hardly the most 
impressive accessory of the day. That honor clearly belonged to Maleeva. 
</P>
<P>
After twisting her left ankle in Friday's match against Catarina Lindqvist, 
Maleeva spent a restless night, with her foot elevated and resting on a pillow 
and encased in an air cast. 
</P>
<P>
She then had the ankle wrapped with tape for her semifinal match against Helena 
Sukova, a match she briefly considered defaulting. 
</P>
<P>
Good thing she didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Maleeva fell behind, 0-2, in the first set, then won six straight games and 
went on to a remarkable 6-2, 6-4 victory over the tournament's second-seeded 
player. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, her ankle in ice, Maleeva said she thinks Sukova might have spent 
too much time worrying about the ankle. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard before the match that people were saying I might have to default, and 
I think she was not prepared for me to be running as well as I did," Maleeva 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After losing the first two games, Maleeva was worried and began talking to 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping that she was not going to make a joke of me on the court," 
Maleeva said. "I said I hope I'm not going to get killed." 
</P>
<P>
But it was Sukova who fell apart. 
</P>
<P>
Sukova, who played listlessly, was not nearly as sharp as she had been in her 
other matches. She tried to exploit Maleeva's ankle injury early in the match, 
but her strategy did not work. 
</P>
<P>
For example, at 1-2 in the first set on game point, Maleeva chased down a drop 
shot and stroked a forehand winner crosscourt. 
</P>
<P>
Later, on consecutive points, Sukova tried to use touch and hit backhand drop 
shots from the baseline. She sent both into the net. 
</P>
<P>
Once Maleeva's lead had grown to 5-2, something unexpected happened: She 
stopped limping. 
</P>
<P>
All this made Sukova wonder if Maleeva's ankle was really that badly injured. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I was thinking too much about her ankle and whether she would be able to 
run," Sukova said. "It obviously wasn't that bad. 
</P>
<P>
"But I was just too slow, a half a step behind all day. I couldn't ask for any 
more chances than I had. I am just disappointed that I did not take them." 
</P>
<P>
Maleeva said that by the second set she was so into the match that she had 
forgotten about her ankle. Before that though, all Maleeva could do was think 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was taped so tight, I could not sprain it again, so I just had to stand the 
pain," she said. 
</P>
<P>
It's been a long week for Byrne, who had to win three qualifying matches just 
to reach the main draw. But it's also been a good week. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it's been her best. Byrne said she has never played better. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it just comes down to the fact that I believe I can win the matches," 
she said. "I doesn't come as a major surprise to me."

NORTH CAROLINA HAS ENOUGH TO DEFEAT MARYLAND, 88-58 
</P>

From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Neither ninth-ranked North Carolina nor upstart Maryland showed much style in 
their Atlantic Coast Conference tournament semifinal Saturday at Atlanta, but 
the Tar Heels had enough substance to gain another trip to the championship 
game. 
</P>
<P>
J.R. Reid scored 17 points, and the Tar Heels took advantage of Maryland's icy 
shooting for an 88-58 victory over the Terrapins, who played without 
hospitalized Coach Bob Wade. 
</P>
<P>
"Maryland was not as sharp as they were yesterday," North Carolina Coach Dean 
Smith said, "but neither were we." 
</P>
<P>
The Tar Heels (26-7) reached the final for the 17th time in the 36 years of the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Wade missed the game when he collapsed moments after Friday's victory over 
top-seeded North Carolina State. He remained in an Atlanta hospital Saturday, 
and school officials said he was resting. 
</P>
<P>
Tests taken on Wade Saturday morning showed no sign of heart disease, the ACC 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland, led by assistant coaches Jeff Adkins and Ron Bradley, finished 9-20 
(1-13 against ACC competition) and suffered the worst loss ever in an ACC 
tournament semifinal. Until Saturday morning, the two assistants thought Wade 
would be on the bench beside them. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't find out that Coach Wade would not be joining us until 10:15 today," 
Bradley said. "I then spoke with him at 11:45 just before our bus left for the 
(arena). He said to go with the basic game plan that we had used yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Dr. Sanford Lavine, Maryland's team physician, had said Wade could 
coach against the ninth-ranked Tar Heels "if all is normal." But the effects of 
Saturday morning's tests apparently precluded that. 
</P>
<P>
Duke 69, Virginia 58 -- After being shut out for the first 16 1/2 minutes of 
the other ACC semifinal, Danny Ferry scored 23 points to lead the 
seventh-ranked Blue Devils, who will play for their third title in four years 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Duke (24-6) has beaten Virginia (19-10) 15 times in a succession, dating back 
to the 1983 tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Ferry, who missed his first six shots and was scoreless until making a layup 
with 3:30 left in the half, scored the Blue Devils' final six points before 
halftime for a 32-16 lead. 
</P>
<P>
OTHER TOURNAMENTS 
</P>
<P>
Big East 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse 81, Seton Hall 78 -- Fifth-ranked Syracuse made 12 of its last 14 free 
throws to advance to the championship game of the tournament, as Sherman 
Douglas scored 27 points to help knock off the 11th-ranked Pirates at New York. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the 17th in a row by the Orangemen (27-6) over Seton Hall 
(26-6). Syracuse is 19-1 against Seton Hall since the Big East started 10 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown 85, Pittsburgh 62 -- Charles Smith scored 26 points, and No. 3 
Georgetown blitzed the Panthers with a 20-0 run in the first half that carried 
the Hoyas to the easy victory in the other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown, the regular-season conference champion, is 25-4. Pitt is 17-12 and 
hoping for an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament on the basis of four wins 
over top 10 teams. 
</P>
<P>
There were eight lead changes and five ties in the first nine minutes before 
Georgetown took control with the 20-point surge, which included a pair of 
three-point baskets and two three-point plays in quick succession. 
</P>
<P>
Big Eight 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma 76, Iowa State 74 -- Tyrone Jones' three-point shot with one second 
left, Oklahoma's only three-pointer of the day, gave the second-ranked Sooners 
the semifinal victory at Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Alexander, who scored 26 points, gave Iowa State a 74-73 lead with 35 
seconds left on a shot from inside. Oklahoma then missed three shots, and 
Alexander was fouled on the rebound with eight seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander missed the front end of the one-and-one, Oklahoma rebounded and 
Mookie Blaylock found Jones on the left wing. Jones spun and, while tightly 
covered, made the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma is 28-4, Iowa State 17-11. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri 88, Kansas State 83 -- Anthony Peeler and Doug Smith keyed an 11-3 run 
to begin the second half, and No. 10 Missouri used its height advantage to win 
the other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers are 26-7, including 6-4 under interim coach Rich Daly. With Daly 
subbing for Norm Stewart, who underwent cancer surgery in February, Missouri 
finished second to Oklahoma in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri's height allowed it to dominate most of the inside play. Kansas 
State's tallest starter was McCoy at 6-7, whereas the Tigers had Mike Sandbothe 
at 6-8, Smith at 6-10, Greg Church at 6-8 and Gary Leonard at 7-1. 
</P>
<P>
Big Sky 
</P>
<P>
Idaho 59, Boise State 52 -- The Vandals, who had their six-point lead cut to 
one with under a minute remaining, held on to win the championship at Boise, 
Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
Larenzo Nash and James Fitch combined for six straight free throws in the final 
31 seconds to clinch the victory for Idaho (25-5). Boise State hopes to get an 
at-large bid into the NCAA tournament with a 23-6 record. 
</P>
<P>
ECAC North Atlantic 
</P>
<P>
Siena 68, Boston U. 67 -- Steve McCoy plucked Tom Huerter's desperation shot 
out of the air and scored with one second left to give the Saints the 
championship at Hartford, Conn., and their first NCAA berth. 
</P>
<P>
It was the ninth consecutive game played by Siena (24-4) under a spectator 
quarantine because of an outbreak of measles at its Upstate New York campus. 
The quarantine, which kept spectators out of the 15,414-seat Hartford Civic 
Center, ends today and will not affect the Saints' first-round matchup. 
</P>
<P>
Boston U. is 21-9. 
</P>

<P>
Louisville 71, Memphis State 70 -- No. 16 Louisville, trailing by nine points 
with 3:32 left, scored the final 10 points of the semifinal game at Columbia, 
S.C. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Everick Sullivan made the first of a one-and-one for the Cardinals, 
the defending tournament champions who advanced to the final for the fourth 
consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State 80, South Carolina 63 -- Derrick Mitchell scored 20 points and 
Tony Dawson added 17 to lead the 14th-ranked Seminoles into today's final. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State, which won the regular-season conference title, is 22-6. South 
Carolina is 19-10, including three losses to the Seminoles. 
</P>
<P>
South Carolina trailed at halftime, 40-31, but closed to 44-41 with 15:19 left 
on John Hudson's jumper. But the Gamecocks went scoreless for the next 4 1/2 
minutes while Florida State scored 11 points to take a 55-41 lead with 10:51 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Mid-American 
</P>
<P>
Ball State 77, Eastern Michigan 76 -- No. 19 Ball State, profiting from a 
mistake by Eastern Michigan's Kory Hallas, won the semifinal game at Toledo, 
Ohio, on Paris McCurdy's two free throws with four seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Hallas, apparently thinking his team trailed by two points instead of three, 
drove in for a layup as the game ended rather than trying a three-point shot 
that would have forced overtime. Hallas had hit a three-pointer with 1:36 left 
to pull Eastern Michigan to within 74-73. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Stalling's free throw with 16 seconds to go gave Ball State a 75-73 lead. 
Eastern Michigan's Isaac Henderson, fouled with five seconds left, made the 
first free throw but missed the second. McCurdy grabbed the rebound, was 
fouled, and converted both shots. 
</P>
<P>
Hallas followed with his layup that left Eastern Michigan (16-13) a point 
short. 
</P>
<P>
Ball State (27-2) advanced to the final to play Kent State, an 88-43 winner 
over Toledo in the other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
Midwestern Collegiate 
</P>
<P>
Xavier 85, Evansville 78 -- Tyrone Hill scored 24 points at Dayton, Ohio, as 
Xavier beat the regular-season champion to win its fourth consecutive 
tournament title. 
</P>
<P>
Evansville (24-5) couldn't contain the double threat of Hill and Michael 
Davenport, a sophomore who scored 18 of his 22 points in the first half. Hill 
scored 14 of his points from the foul line for Xavier (21-11). 
</P>
<P>
Xavier broke the game open with its foul shooting in the final six minutes, 
padding a two-point lead to 11. Xavier sank 15 of 19 free throws, with Jamal 
Walker hitting eight of nine in that span. 
</P>
<P>
Southeastern 
</P>
<P>
Florida 76, Tennessee 71 -- Livingston Chatman scored 25 points to lead the 
Gators in the semifinal game at Knoxville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Florida's final eight points came at the free-throw line. There were 12 ties 
and 14 lead changes before the Gators, the SEC regular-season champions, took 
the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
Alabama 83, Vanderbilt 79 -- Alvin Lee scored 24 points, including three 
straight three-point baskets during one stretch, as the Crimson Tide reached 
the title game with their fourth straight win. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth victory in a row for the Crimson Tide (22-7). Vanderbilt 
(19-13) hit 11 of 19 from three-point range, including a tournament-record six 
by Barry Booker, who finished with 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
Alabama made seven of 10 three-pointers, but a 34-25 rebounding edge and 55% 
shooting from the field gave the Crimson Tide the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest 
</P>
<P>
Texas 93, Texas Christian 89 -- Lance Blanks scored five of his 25 points in 
overtime to lift Texas to the semifinal win at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
The Longhorns (24-7) led only twice in regulation, both one-point leads early 
in the second half. But Blanks scored the first five points of overtime and the 
TCU (18-13) caught up. 
</P>
<P>
Texas made 10 of 13 free throws in the overtime period, including four in the 
final 18 seconds. Five Horned Frogs fouled out, including Craig Sibley, who had 
25 points and 15 rebounds before leaving with 5:57 left in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
It was Texas' second consecutive overtime game, the Longhorns having defeated 
Southern Methodist, 93-91, in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas 94, Texas A&amp;M 84 -- Lenzie Howell had a career-high 31 points, and 
Keith Wilson, who scored 26 points in the quarterfinals, got 19 of his 25 in 
the semifinals in the second half to lead the Razorbacks into today's 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Western Athletic 
</P>
<P>
Texas El Paso 73, Colorado State 60 -- The Miners won their third conference 
tournament in six years and earned their sixth straight NCAA appearance as Tim 
Hardaway scored 25 points at Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State, the top-seeded team, led, 28-25, when Andy Anderson scored with 
3:23 left in the first half, but the Miners (25-6) took over from there. 
</P>
<P>
Prince Stewart, who finished with 22 points, sparked an 11-0 run with a 
three-point basket, a field goal and two free throws to give El Paso a 36-28 
lead before Trent Shippen sank a three-pointer for Colorado State (22-9) at the 
halftime buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
The Miners continued their assault at the start of the second half when Greg 
Foster and Hardaway, the tournament's most valuable player, each hit jumpers. 
</P>
<P>
NON-TOURNAMENT 
</P>
<P>
Iowa 87, Indiana 70 -- Roy Marble scored 19 points and Ed Horton and B.J. 
Armstrong had 18 each at Iowa City, Iowa, as the 15th-ranked Hawkeyes beat the 
sixth-ranked Hoosiers, who kept four starters on the bench after clinching the 
Big Ten title. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa snapped a four-game losing streak to finish the regular season at 22-9 
overall, 10-8 in the Big Ten. Indiana is 25-7, 15-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Hoosiers played the game without leading scorer and conference player of 
the year Jay Edwards and starting center Todd Jadlow. Edwards, a sophomore 
guard averaging 20.4 points, hurt his back in a 75-64 victory Thursday night 
over Wisconsin, while Jadlow, averaging nearly 11 points, injured his right 
ankle and suffered a deep bruise on his left thigh against the Badgers. 
</P>
<P>
Except for Lyndon Jones, who scored nine points, the Hoosiers played the entire 
game with reserves. Still, Indiana trailed, 32-26, at halftime before Iowa 
pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois 89, Michigan 73 -- Kenny Battle scored 22 points and Kendall Gill 
added 19 as the fourth-ranked Illini clinched second place in the Big Ten with 
the victory over the eighth-ranked Wolverines at Ann Arbor, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the best game I've played because I put everything together," Battle 
said. "I rebounded, played defense and scored. I'd say this was my first total 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Rumeal Robinson scored 22 points and Loy Vaught added 15 for the Wolverines 
(24-7, 12-6). Glen Rice, the Big Ten's leading scorer, was held to 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
"They did a great job on Glen," Michigan Coach Bill Frieder said of Rice, who 
entered the game averaging 25.5 points. "They weren't going to let him get his 
shots. He worked hard, but they stopped him." 
</P>
<P>
Illinois (27-4, 14-4) set a school record for victories in a season. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe with the exception of the Indiana team of the mid-70s, it is the best 
basketball team I've seen in my 16 years here," Frieder said. "They are so 
quick and so good at every position." 
</P>
<P>
DePaul 73, Notre Dame 70 -- Stanley Brundy hit all 10 of his shots and Terence 
Greene scored 12 of his 21 points in the second half at Rosemont, Ill., to lead 
the Blue Demons past the Fighting Irish and, most likely, into an NCAA berth. 
</P>
<P>
DePaul is 20-11. Notre Dame, which slipped to 20-8 and split the season series 
between the independent powers, also is expected to make the 64-team NCAA 
field. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 78, Ohio State 70 -- The Golden Gophers finished with their best 
regular-season record in six seasons thanks to the Big Ten victory at Columbus, 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Melvin Newbern and Willie Burton scored 17 points each for Minnesota, which won 
its third straight to improve to 17-11 and 9-9. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State dropped its eighth straight and fell to 17-14 and 6-12.

NHL ROUNDUP;

CAPITALS BEAT RANGERS, 4-2, TO TAKE LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The scoring slump of the New York Rangers continued Saturday night at Landover, 
Md., and the Washington Capitals moved into first place in the hotly contested 
Patrick Division race. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Hunter snapped a 2-2 tie by scoring his 17th goal with just 4:42 
remaining, and the Capitals handed the Rangers their fifth consecutive defeat, 
4-2. In the five games the Rangers have scored just seven goals. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Mullen's power-play score at 5:12 of the final period brought the Rangers 
into the tie. But with time running down, Geoff Courtnall dug the puck out of 
the corner and, while being knocked down, fired a strike to Hunter in the slot. 
Hunter's shot went just inside the left post. 
</P>
<P>
Two minutes later, a fluke goal put the game out of reach. Doug Wickenheiser 
got the credit when the rebound of his shot struck New York's Tony Granato and 
caromed into the net. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Dino Ciccarelli, obtained to boost the Capitals' offense, scored his 
first goal since being traded by Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
With 10 games left, the Capitals lead the Rangers by two points. They lead 
Pittsburgh, which has 11 games remaining, by three. Philadelphia, a long shot 
at best, is eight points behind with 11 games to play. 
</P>
<P>
There was a scare as the Capitals prepared for their skate-around Saturday 
afternoon. An employee at Capital Centre mistook road flares for dynamite. 
Before the mistake was discovered, the Capitals had evacuated the building and 
practice was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 6, Boston 6 -- The Bruins so dominated the last period at Boston that 
the Sabres had only two shots on goal. However, one by Scott Arniel, with 2:33 
left in regulation, slipped past goalie Rejean Lemelin for they tying score. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo never led during the game and twice trailed by two goals. Arniel's goal 
was his second of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Defenseman Ray Bourque also had two goals for the Bruins, including the 
go-ahead score with 3:30 left in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 7, Chicago 2 -- Rick Tocchet and Tim Kerr each scored twice at 
Philadelphia, and No. 2 goaltender Mark LaForest was brilliant in the nets to 
enable the Flyers to end a five-game winless streak. 
</P>
<P>
LaForest stopped 35 shots. The Flyers' top goaltender Ron Hextall has a pulled 
hamstring. The Flyers had been 0-2-3. 
</P>
<P>
New York Islanders 3, New Jersey 2 -- Pat LaFontaine scored the tying goal 
halfway through the third period at Uniondale, N.Y., and the winning goal 64 
seconds into overtime to deal the Devils' playoff hopes a severe blow. 
</P>
<P>
With Philadelphia winning, the Devils, who have 10 games remaining, trail the 
Flyers by 10 points in the fight for the final berth in the Patrick Division. 
</P>
<P>
LaFontaine blasted a shot between the pads of goalie Sean Burke for his 37th 
goal and the winner on the first shot in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 5, Hartford 3 -- Guy Carbonneau and Petr Svoboda scored 29 seconds 
apart early in the second period at Montreal as the Adams Division champions 
continued their bid for the best overall record. 
</P>
<P>
With 103 points to 101 for Calgary, the Canadiens, after their fifth 
consecutive win, moved closer to their goal. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton 5, Calgary 5 -- After building a 5-3 lead with 12 minutes left, the 
Oilers had to settle for a tie at home. They stretched their lead over the 
Kings in the battle for second place in the Smythe Division to two points. 
</P>
<P>
Lanny McDonald cut the lead to one at 8:24, and Jim Peplinski tied it with his 
10th goal at 15:30. 
</P>
<P>
Former King Jimmy Carson had his 45th goal for the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 5, Detroit 3 -- The Maple Leafs kept their playoff hopes alive by 
scoring four times in the first period at Toronto and holding on for the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Wendsel Clark and Vincent Damphousse scored goals 17 seconds apart to fuel the 
rally that put Toronto just four points behind Chicago in the fight for the 
last playoff spot in the Norris Division. Toronto has 10 games left, Chicago 
11. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 2, St. Louis 2 -- Neither of these teams has clinched a playoff spot 
in the weak Norris Division, either. 
</P>
<P>
Neal Broten scored at 8:19 of the final period at St. Louis to get the North 
Stars the tie. 
</P>
<P>
As the stretch drive begins, St. Louis, in second place, has 62 points, 
Minnesota 59, Chicago 58 and Toronto 54. DAN HAFNER

SAM HALL KAPLAN: CENTRAL CITY WEST: DON'T TELL US, SHOW US 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM HALL KAPLAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The long-awaited urban design and land use plan for Central City West is in the 
last throes of preparation, not unlike a concoction of raw meat being readied 
for a cage of hungry tigers. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the plan so tasty for the tigers is the potential of the area, 
encompassing 355 acres from the Harbor Freeway west to Witmer Street and 
Glendale Boulevard, and from Olympic Boulevard north to the Hollywood Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Given the proximity to downtown, the rolling hills with views, and swaths of 
vacant and underdeveloped land, the area is variously viewed as a natural 
extension of an office-tower-dominated downtown, a thriving residential 
community serving the city's need for more housing near jobs and a collection 
of choice sites for inner-city schools. 
</P>
<P>
More generally, and idealistically, the area also contains the potential of an 
urbane village, serving downtown but also serving itself with an imaginative 
mix of uses. These would include sensitively scaled offices, shops, schools, 
and, in particular, a range of housing, from rehabilitated bungalows and 
affordable apartments to upscale condo complexes, set in a network of 
pedestrian friendly streets, plazas and parks. 
</P>
<P>
This enlightened vision appears to be the thrust of the so-called specific plan 
now being prepared by the design firm of Meyer &amp; Allen, aided by a bevy of 
consultants, including Barrio Planners. It places most of the offices on the 
eastern edge of the area and along the Wilshire Boulevard corridor, while 
taking advantage of the Crown and Temple-Beaudry hills for housing and parks. 
Scattered throughout would be stores and schools. 
</P>
<P>
Although the planning effort is being paid for by a consortium of major 
property owners in the area so as to expedite required -- and desired -- design 
guidelines and zoning changes, it has been a relatively public process, thanks 
to the insistence of Councilwoman Gloria Molina and an emerging vocal resident 
population. Most of the estimated 17,000 people who live there are tenants, 
Latino and poor, including a wary few who have been displaced by redevelopment 
projects elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Out of a series of neighborhood meetings has come a plea that no existing 
housing -- however deteriorated -- be demolished until replacement housing at 
reasonably comparable rents be constructed, and that generally, what is left of 
the neighborhoods there, after years of being nibbled away at by speculators, 
somehow be rehabilitated and made more attractive, and livable. 
</P>
<P>
It all sounds good, but few persons who have watched the Central City West saga 
believe it will be developed according to the plan. Indeed, even if it is 
eventually adopted, given muscle through zoning and embraced by Mayor Tom 
Bradley, in the end it will just be prey for the tigers, the meat consumed and 
the bones spit out. 
</P>
<P>
Dampening hopes that the redevelopment of Central City West will be different 
from other efforts, such as California Plaza, is the presence of a gaggle of 
lobbyists representing some major investors with political clout, a school 
board insensitive to the community, some shortsighted absentee landlords and a 
sprinkling of well-meaning but naive neighborhood organizers. 
</P>
<P>
Like tigers, each out for himself, they promise to pull apart whatever plan is 
presented. Setting an unfortunate tone among the lobbyists has been former 
Councilman Arthur K. Snyder, who represents developer Ray Watt. Snyder is 
remembered for, among other things, trying as a councilman, to sink a community 
effort to save a Hollywood bungalow court. Most recently, he represented a 
developer who on New Year's Day attempted through a misrepresentation of an 
address to demolish the historic McKinley Mansion. 
</P>
<P>
Among other well-connected lobbyists and lawyers of note representing 
developers with holdings in the area are George Mihslten, former city Planning 
Commission chairman Dan Garcia, and former Bradley aide Norman Emerson. 
Although they generally have been more reasonable than Snyder in recognizing 
the need for a balance of commercial and residential, their presence is viewed 
warily by the community. 
</P>
<P>
Seemingly oblivious to the protracted planning process has been the school 
board. 
</P>
<P>
Its building committee recently indicated that it was seeking to locate several 
schools in the area, including a junior high school, and might resort to the 
use of eminent domain to obtain the sites -- regardless of whatever community 
plan is eventually adopted. 
</P>
<P>
The waters were further muddied when developer Leonard Glickman embraced and 
embellished the school board proposal as a way to clear 50 acres and, along 
with the schools, to build several square block of apartment houses. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing like the phrase "eminent domain" to send a shiver of fear 
through residents and property owners alike, and a shiver of frustration 
through the planners and officials trying to work with them. 
</P>
<P>
And then there are the well-meaning community organizations, who according to 
their leaflets, want "affordable housing, quality schools, more parks, less 
traffic and a stronger voice in decisions," and do not want "more skyscraper 
office buildings in our back yards." 
</P>
<P>
That sounds nice. However, it doesn't recognize the harsh reality in this 
lingering age of Reaganism (meaning no public funds for such needs) that the 
only way projects such as affordable housing and parks are going to be financed 
is to tie their construction in some way to the approval of the more lucrative 
office development. The concept is known as linkage, and has produced needed 
housing in Boston and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
But given the history of promises unkept in Los Angeles, communities do not 
want to be told what may happen if they allow a particular office development 
to move forward. Instead, they want to be shown, and not just pretty 
renderings. 
</P>
<P>
With this in mind, and given the many vacant parcels in Central City West, the 
consortium of property owners wanting a reasonable plan to move forward would 
be wise to consider undertaking -- before anything else -- a demonstration 
project incorporating the promises that have been made. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration project could be a well-scaled, sensitively designed complex 
with a variety of housing types and subsidies that could serve as a relocation 
resource for the inevitable demolition of some of the more decrepit buildings 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Included also as a demonstration of innovative programming and design could be 
supportive commercial and community facilities, such as a so-called vest-pocket 
school whose playground can double as a park, its library open to all after 
hours and a host of other mixes and matches that have been successfully tried 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles begs for such a planning and design demonstration, and Central City 
West would be as good a place as any to begin. It is time to tame the tigers.

AT HOME / SILVER LAKE: SILVER LAKE: WESTSIDE LIFE STYLE AT HALF PRICE; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE VALUES SOAR WITH ECLECTIC BUYERS DRAWN TO THE STEEP HILLS, SHORT 
COMMUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EVELYN De WOLFE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Realtor Jeffrey Young, behind the wheel of his sporty Jaguar, handled the steep 
hills of Silver Lake with familiar ease. The 27-year-old Young knows his way 
around, perhaps even better than some of the community's old-timers. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up in this area," Young said of the Silver Lake district, located 2 1/2 
miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, "My grandmother still lives here and 
my dad runs a family plumbing business that's been around for 60 years." 
</P>
<P>
Young drove to the crest of Micheltorena Street and parked by a turreted, 
four-level house where Judy Garland had lived in the late 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my favorite. All the rooms are round, but wait until you see the 
teahouse and the gazebo," Young said, leading the way down a block-long public 
stairway (one of about 100 known to remain throughout Los Angeles), for a back 
yard view of the 4,000-square-foot house that sold recently as a fixer-upper 
for $450,000. 
</P>
<P>
Young bought his own home in Silver Lake a few months ago and said he was lucky 
to get it for $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Home Prices Soared 
</P>
<P>
Real estate values have been soaring in the area. A year ago, prices ranged 
from $100,000 to $500,000; now they're more like $200,000 to $600,000, and 
higher. And while the median price for homes in the city rose by 26% in 1988, 
houses in Silver Lake increased by 33%. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles Board of Realtors report for the past year listed Silver Lake as 
the leader in home sales, with 398, followed by Pacific Palisades with 395. 
</P>
<P>
Silver Lake was considered a "sleeper" until about 10 years ago and was largely 
ignored by builders, who favored the San Fernando Valley and Westside areas, 
said Alita Hanger, president of the Silver Lake Residents Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"But with increasing development downtown, and prices still well below 
comparable properties on the Westside of town . . . more people will be moving 
into the neighborhood," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Silver Lake -- the community's focal point and the city's oldest fresh-water 
reservoir -- forms an amphitheater-like setting for its eastern and western 
residential slopes. The reservoir was built in 1909 and named for Herman 
Silver, a member of Los Angeles' first board of water commissioners. Adjoining 
it is the smaller Ivanhoe reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Converge at The Hub 
</P>
<P>
Silver Lake's main drag is an undistinguished stretch of Sunset Boulevard that 
skirts the hills, east to west, from Echo Park to Hollywood, and separates them 
from the Bellevue district to the south. 
</P>
<P>
The community's other thoroughfares -- Hyperion and Rowena avenues and Glendale 
and Silver Lake boulevards -- converge to form a delta of neighborhood activity 
at the north end of Hyperion, known simply as The Hub. 
</P>
<P>
The Hub is where much of the local gossip is exchanged, and where the Old Hub 
Market has been upgraded to include take-out gourmet foods and wine, and where 
Say Cheese, another popular stop, sells pates, dolmas and marinated mushrooms, 
and deals with its customers on a first-name basis. Nearby, the Mayfair Market 
occupies the site of Walt Disney's first studio. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood's diverse ethnic, cultural and economic mix, which includes 
long-established Asian and gay communities, is reflected in a number of eating 
places serving Japanese, vegetarian Indian and other exotic cooking, and in the 
small shops featuring antiques, clothing, handicrafts and the usual 
neighborhood services. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Struck by Friendliness 
</P>
<P>
Michael Blum has only just discovered Silver Lake and it's where he wants to 
live. "I moved from New York a few weeks ago, and I've never been in a 
friendlier place," he said. " I mean, people actually say hello." 
</P>
<P>
Another ex-New Yorker, art director David Sackeroff, has lived in Silver Lake 
for 11 years and claims it's "one of the few real neighborhoods left in L.A. 
where people actually meet and talk. It's a walking community and I guess 
that's because so many of us own dogs." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Brenneman and Gregory Swordes, newcomers from San Francisco, were looking 
for a rental in the Silver Lake area last year and ended up buying an older, 
1,300-square-foot house with a view for under $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want a long commute to my downtown office and the views and steep 
hills reminded us of San Francisco, except that Silver Lake is much more 
suburban," Brenneman said. "We've been accustomed to living wall-to-wall with 
our neighbors. At first I felt a bit isolated." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Neat Older Homes' 
</P>
<P>
Norma and Ralph Blunt, owners of Antiques on Melrose, also are part of the new 
wave of younger professionals with two incomes who have moved recently to the 
area, attracted by the spectacular views and "neat older homes." 
</P>
<P>
"We enjoy a Westside life style for half the price," Norma Blunt said. Their 
1929 home, which features a living room stage for concerts, built by the first 
owner, is part of the original subdivision of silent movie star Antonio 
Moreno's estate. Its grand old mansion is still preserved by the Franciscan 
Missionary Sisters. 
</P>
<P>
New Silver Lake residents soon learn from their neighbors that they're 
surrounded by the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright, Rudolph Schindler, 
Richard Neutra, Gregory Ain and John Lautner, who turned the area into a 
showcase for their experimental designs. 
</P>
<P>
They also eventually become aware of the area's rich movie history. The 
old-time Keystone Studio in Silver Lake's Ellendale neighborhood is where Mack 
Sennett's Keystone Cops and bathing beauties cavorted and where cowboy Tom 
Mix's mounts chased up the hills. Later, Clark Gable and Carole Lombard kept a 
romantic hideaway in those same hills before they were free to marry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Steep Street Attracts 
</P>
<P>
Scenes from several movies in the '20s and '30s were filmed on Fargo Street 
starring Charlie Chaplin, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, and the Three Stooges. 
Even today the steep street is a favorite of competing runners and cyclists and 
the Fire Department on occasion will use the hill to test its equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The influx of new residents has been growing steadily, according to Hanger, 
president of a strong and vocal 500-member residents' association that has been 
grappling for years with issues that threatened to destroy the beauty of the 
reservoir and the character of the community. 
</P>
<P>
The association's vice president, Sheriff's Capt. Bento Kienast, was born in 
Silver Lake and still lives in the Swiss chalet that his architect father 
designed. 
</P>
<P>
"We are beginning to see quite a few changes in the community, but our worst 
problem is the increased traffic density on our main streets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The association successfully opposed the extension of the Glendale Freeway 
through Silver Lake and waged an 11-year battle to scale down the proposed 
2,200 units planned for the historic Garbutt-Hathaway estate on the east side 
of the reservoir to 96 detached homes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Property Crimes Dropped 
</P>
<P>
While residents are concerned about daytime burglaries, "Silver Lake has one of 
the lowest crime rates . . . in our northeast area (including Atwater, Highland 
Park, Eagle Rock, Elysian Valley, Dodger Stadium and Griffith Park)," said 
Capt. Noel Cunningham, commanding officer of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Northeast Division. 
</P>
<P>
In the first six weeks of 1989, property crimes in Silver Lake and in portions 
of east Hollywood and Los Feliz showed an 18% decline compared to the same 
period in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The Silver Lake schools are Ivanhoe and Micheltorena elementary schools, Thomas 
Starr King Junior High School and John Marshall High School. It won the 1986-87 
National Academic Decathlon.

HANDYMAN Q &amp; A: HOME IMPROVEMENT;

<P>
BREAK UP THE SIDEWALK TO REMOVE TREE ROOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDY LANG, Associated Press Newsfeatures 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q: A large tree near our house has caused the nearby sidewalk to crack. In one 
place, the concrete has lifted several inches. Do I have to remove all the 
concrete and how is it done? Also, how can I prevent the tree roots from 
causing further damage. A friend says if I cut them it will kill the tree. 
</P>
<P>
A: Use a cold chisel and a sledgehammer or other heavy hammer to break the 
sidewalk into several pieces. They can be removed more easily than if the 
concrete is left in one or two pieces. Cutting the roots with an ax will not 
kill the tree. After the roots have been chopped so they no longer can extend 
themselves, put down new concrete, using expansion joints if necessary. You can 
use a concrete mix that needs only the addition of water, or mix your own from 
sand, portland cement and aggregate. 
</P>
<P>
Cut Hardboard Panels With a Special Blade 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have several large panels of a synthetic wood with a kind of plastic 
finish that looks like marble. I probably will use it on a project I have in 
mind. The synthetic is very hard. I have a portable saber saw which I use 
sometimes to cut plywood. If I use it on these panels, will it ruin the saw? 
</P>
<P>
A: It sounds as though you have panels of hardboard. It is not synthetic, but 
made from regular wood logs that are converted to chips and wood fibers and 
bonded under heat and pressure. It can be cut with most saws but might not 
yield easily to a saber saw unless you use a special blade. Since there are 
some differences between standard hardboard and tempered hardboard, it would be 
a good idea to take a sheet of the material to your local lumberyard and ask 
what variety of hardboard it is and what saw blades can be used to cut it. 
</P>
<P>
'Flat Plate' Collector Draws Solar Energy 
</P>
<P>
Q:. I hope to convert my house to solar energy. I constantly see the term "flat 
plate collector." I know what a solar collector is but the words "flat plate" 
mean nothing to me. Can you help? 
</P>
<P>
A: A flat plate collector generally consists of an absorbing plate, often 
metallic and painted black to increase absorption of the sun's heat. It is 
insulated on the back and covered with a transparent cover sheet to trap heat 
within the collector. There are many variations of flat plate collectors. You 
will find out more about them when you are ready to have a conversion made. 
</P>
<P>
Compression Faucets Are Older, Use Washers 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have read a chapter in a booklet telling how to repair what is called a 
compression faucet. How do I know whether my faucet is that type? 
</P>
<P>
A: In a compression faucet, a threaded spindle is turned and the washer at the 
end of the lower end is pressed against a valve seat. This shuts off the supply 
of water. Modern faucets do not use washers. If your faucet has one, it is of 
the compression-type. Despite the big inroads into the market of washerless 
faucets, the majority of houses still have compression faucets simply because 
they are old.MDO Plywood Is Best for Exterior Projects 
</P>
<P>
Q: Soon I will be using plywood in an exterior project. It is important that 
the paint job be extra smooth. Which kind of plywood should I get? 
</P>
<P>
A: Not all lumberyards have it, but it can be ordered. It is a type of plywood 
called MDO. Those letters stand for Medium Density Overlay. The face of this 
kind of plywood is treated so that it will take an exceptionally smooth painted 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
Louvered Patio Roof Will Filter Sunlight 
</P>
<P>
Q: I intend to put a roof on our patio. I will be using 4-by-4 wooden posts, 
4-by-6 beams and 2-by-6 joists. I would like a roof that filters the sunlight, 
using 1-by-4s for the louvers. How far apart should they be to allow some 
sunlight to come through, yet not enough to make it too warm on a hot day. 
</P>
<P>
A:. Spaces of three inches between the wood should be just right to accomplish 
your purpose. The louvers should be placed on edge and toenailed to the joists.

BUY EXTENSION LADDER THAT 'FITS' YOUR HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. J. HAND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No homeowner can get by for long without a good extension ladder. It's a basic 
tool for painting, roof and gutter work, cleaning and changing windows, working 
in trees and all-around outdoor maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, few homeowners know much about buying ladders or using them 
safely, despite the fact that the wrong ladder, or the right one used 
improperly, can land you flat on your back, in a hospital bed -- or worse. 
</P>
<P>
If you need a new ladder, probably the best all-around choice is aluminum. It 
will cost about the same as wood, weigh less and last longer. Magnesium is even 
lighter, but quite expensive. Fiberglass is safer around electrical lines, but 
higher in weight and price. 
</P>
<P>
How long should your ladder be? Measure the distance up to the highest point on 
your home that you feel the need to reach. This is roughly how long the ladder 
should be. Of course, a 24-footer won't extend all the way to 24 feet because 
the two sections must overlap. And, of course, you can't safely stand on the 
top three rungs of any extension ladder. These two limitations cut the 
"effective height" of any ladder about 6 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, when you add your height plus your overhead reach to the formula, you 
do manage to end up just about where you started: at the listed length of the 
ladder. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sold By Duty Ratings 
</P>
<P>
In practice, for most work on the typical two-story house, a 24-footer is a 
good choice. If your home has high gables, a 32-footer will be more useful. 
</P>
<P>
Ladders are sold with duty ratings of I, II and III. Type I is the strongest 
and stiffest, Type III the lightest duty. 
</P>
<P>
Type II stands in the middle, and is a good compromise between expense, weight 
and rigidity, at least for a 24-foot ladder. If you need a 32-footer, you'll 
probably feel safer on a Type I. Lighter duty ladders this long can sway and 
wobble enough to destroy your confidence when you are 20 feet off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Each time you use any ladder, check it over first. This is especially important 
with wooden ladders. If stored improperly, they can rot, dry out and crack, 
losing strength in the process. Once when my father was up on a wooden ladder, 
the rung he was standing on broke under his weight. He crashed down to the rung 
below and that one broke, too. Fortunately, the next rung held and he wasn't 
hurt. This kind of domino effect is a lot of laughs when it happens to the Road 
Runner, but it's not quite so funny in real life. 
</P>
<P>
Next step for safety? Step into some hard-soled shoes with heels. The hard 
soles provide comfort and the heels keep your feet from slipping off the rungs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Momentum Helps 
</P>
<P>
Now you are ready to stand the ladder up. This is easiest when the ladder isn't 
extended. Place its base against the foundation of your house so it can't move. 
Grasp the other end of the ladder and walk hand over hand along the rungs, 
raising the ladder as you go. Do this in one smooth motion and the momentum 
will help you get the ladder up. 
</P>
<P>
Once it's vertical, you can extend the ladder by pulling on the extension rope. 
Next, move the foot of the ladder out from the wall so the ladder leans in at a 
75-degree angle. 
</P>
<P>
Your ladder may have a sight-line sticker on it to help you get the angle 
right. If not, put the base about one-third the extended height of the ladder 
away from the wall, as shown in the sketch. This should put you in the 
ballpark. If the base is too close to the wall, the ladder can tip over 
backwards. If it's too far out, the ladder may sag excessively, or even break 
under your weight. 
</P>
<P>
Before climbing the ladder, be sure both its feet rest firmly on the ground. 
Some ladders come with adjustable feet to help you compensate for uneven 
terrain. With others you can dig out under the "long" (best approach) or shim 
under the "short" leg.

CITY LINES: ART TO RIVAL DESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM HALL KAPLAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For nearly four decades photographer Marvin Rand has been documenting the 
architecture of Southern California for a variety of popular and professional 
books and journals. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly celebrated are his exquisite photographs of the early-20th-Century 
designs of Irving Gill and the brothers Charles and Henry Greene, many of whose 
buildings have since been demolished. 
</P>
<P>
In a pleasing coincidence, Rand's distinctive photographs of the works of these 
architects will be on display in separate exhibits: 
</P>
<P>
The Greenes at Kirsten Kiser's Gallery for Architecture, 964 N. La Brea Ave., 
from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., Tuesdays through Saturdays, until April 29; and Gills, 
at the Modern Living gallery, 4063 Redwood Ave., 10 to 7, Monday through 
Friday, and 12 to 5, Saturday and Sundays, from March 25 through May 1. 
</P>
<P>
Rand, ever the diplomat, won't say whose architecture he prefers, saying that 
each has its genuis. 
</P>
<P>
"What I try to do is abstract the content from the details of the design that 
express the indigenuous creativity of the architect." It is the sort of 
statement that architects love, and has made Rand one of the more popular 
practioneers. SAM HALL KAPLAN

CITY LINES: COMFORT OF LOVE SEATS

<TEXT>
<P>
The so-called "decorative arts" -- everything from pottery to love seats -- 
often fall into the abyss between the "high" arts and commerce. Putting 
furniture in museums to be gazed upon as art objects is a relatively modern 
notion. 
</P>
<P>
The new Center for the Study of Decorative Arts in San Juan Capistrano is the 
first of its kind on the West Coast. Situated in a delightful cluster of 
Mission-style buildings centered on a patio garden, the center opens its doors 
with an exhibition titled "California Style: Collectors and Collections." 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition features room settings composed of the furniture, ceramics, 
needlework, textiles and other decorative arts. 
</P>
<P>
"Because our homes and environments leave lasting impressions on our 
intellectual and spiritual growth, we are committed to (integrating) the 
history of furniture, architecture, decorations and gardens," said center 
director G.P. (Gep) Durenberger. 
</P>
<P>
The great social virtue of the decorative arts is the way they reassure us 
about the continuity of our culture. Unlike painting or sculpture, love seats 
comfort our bottoms rather than challenge our complacencies. Visitors to the 
center are certain to come away smiling with pleasure. LEON WHITESON

DEVELOPERS TRY SEVERAL TACKS TO COPE WITH INTEREST RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Commercial and industrial developers are taking a number of different tacks to 
cope with the recent run up in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Some are choosing adjustable-rate mortgages instead of fixed-rate loans, hoping 
that inflationary pressures will soon ease. Others are utilizing complex 
financing techniques to lower their borrowing costs. 
</P>
<P>
Still others are simply cutting back their plans to build new office buildings 
or industrial parks. 
</P>
<P>
But even maneuvers such as those may not be enough to avoid a widespread 
construction slowdown if interest rates go much higher, development experts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
Some builders have already delayed planned projects because of high vacancy 
rates in many Southland commercial and industrial markets, and further rate 
hikes could force them to indefinitely postpone their plans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Going to Build 
</P>
<P>
"If (prime) interest rates hit 12%, or certainly 12 1/2% or 13%, construction 
is going to grind to a stop," said Winston Elton, principal of the Goodkin Real 
Estate Consulting Group in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of projects that are on the drawing boards now would stay there," he 
said, "and even some of the developers who are ready to break ground are going 
to have to put their plans on the shelf for a while. 
</P>
<P>
"If these developers don't have good financing for their projects lined up yet, 
then they're not going to build -- at least not this year," Elton said. 
</P>
<P>
Most loans for commercial and industrial projects are linked to the prime rate, 
the rate banks charge their most credit-worthy customers -- typically, other 
mammoth lending institutions. Developers usually pay a rate that is one or two 
points above prime. 
</P>
<P>
The prime rate has risen steadily from about 9% last summer to 11.5% today, 
meaning most developers are now paying 12 1/2% to 13 1/2% for their loans. 
</P>
<P>
The recent rate increases and prospects for further hikes have had a dual 
effect at KMK Real Corp., a real estate investment company based in Marina del 
Rey. 
</P>
<P>
A few months ago, the company rejected an 11 1/2% fixed-rate loan to buy a 
shopping center in Acton, and instead chose an adjustable-rate mortgage with an 
introductory 8 3/4% rate, figuring the 2 3/4-point savings would save them 
thousands of dollars in monthly interest payments. 
</P>
<P>
"We might have taken a fixed-rate loan earlier, but fixed rates are just too 
high now," said Steve Meepos, a KMK general partner. 
</P>
<P>
However, the company is considering paying a $20,000 fee to guarantee $2 
million in fixed-rate financing for future buyers at a housing tract it is 
building in Redlands, fearing that future rate increases may make the homes 
unaffordable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Save $50,000 a Month 
</P>
<P>
Over at Jaric Development Partners, a mid-sized commercial and industrial 
developer based in Los Angeles, executives are using an increasingly popular 
financing technique to mitigate interest-rate increases and lower their 
borrowing costs. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials recently needed to borrow a total of about $60 million for 
three different projects. 
</P>
<P>
They had two basic choices: Take the usual construction loan of about 1 1/2 
over prime, or get a loan from a local bank that was linked to the London 
Interbank Offered Rate, a global version of the U.S. prime. 
</P>
<P>
Jaric took the loan linked to LIBOR. Even after paying the lender's markup on 
the loan, Jaric is borrowing at 11 3/4% -- a better choice than the 12 1/4% 
rate it would have paid by choosing the prime-plus-1 1/2-point loan. 
</P>
<P>
"We're saving $50,000 a month in interest charges," said Michael J. McGarrey, 
Jaric's chief financial officer. "That's a big deal to a company of any size. 
After a while, you've paid several salaries with your savings." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Businesses Get Nervous' 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Carson-based Watson Land Co. have taken a much simpler tack to 
combat rising rates: They have decided to build only about 500,000 square feet 
of office and industrial space this year, down from their usual 750,000 square 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
"We sat down in the final quarter of last year and (accurately) predicted that 
rates would keep going up in the early part of 1989," said Richard M. Cannon, 
Watson's president. 
</P>
<P>
"When interest rates go up, businesses get nervous and cut back on their 
expansion plans. That translates into lower demand for space in our office 
buildings and industrial parks. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to get stuck with a bunch of space that we couldn't lease, so 
we decided to cut back," Cannon said.

Project Restore, an organization formed by Mayor Tom Bradley and others with 
the goal of preserving the fabric of Los Angeles, has been awarded a 
$250,000-grant by the Ahmanson Foundation to be used in the restoration of the 
Los Angeles City Hall Main Street lobby. 
</P>
<P>
The lobby project -- the first of Project Restore's renovation efforts -- is 
expected to cost between $1.1 and $1.5 million and is expected to begin early 
next year, under the direction of the architectural firm of Hardy, Holzman 
&amp; Pfeiffer. Albert C. Martin, son of the original City Hall architect, 
serves as chairman of the 22-member Project Restore board of directors.

Maguire Thomas Partners, a Santa Monica-based development firm known for its 
ability to win governmental approval of its projects, has acquired an interest 
in Summa Corp.'s $1-billion Playa Vista project south of Marina del Rey, and is 
redesigning the controversial development. 
</P>
<P>
The project, a 957-acre planned community, has been mired in controversy over 
its density and threat to nearby wetlands. Last summer, Los Angeles 
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, whose district includes the project, called for a 
40% reduction in the amount of office space, expansion of the wetlands and a 
new environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson C. Rising, who will head the development team for Playa Vista, said it 
was too early to say what specific changes will be made in the original plan.

SCHOOL RESOLVES CENSORSHIP DISPUTE 
</P>

<P>
The controversy over censorship at Marshall Fundamental School ended last week 
not long after Marcia Luecke invoked a Greek fable. 
</P>
<P>
Luecke, the mother of the editor of the high school's newspaper, had been 
chosen to represent parents who were worried about possible censorship of the 
monthly paper. The Eagle's Eye was under fire for articles that were alleged to 
be racially insensitive and unpatriotic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Different Viewpoints 
</P>
<P>
During a two-hour, closed meeting Tuesday, Luecke said she was the last to 
speak among the nine participants with vastly different and strongly held 
viewpoints. 
</P>
<P>
Luecke, a Los Angeles County juvenile court referee and mediator, compared the 
13-year-old student newspaper to the goose threatened with death if it didn't 
continue to produce golden eggs. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the newspaper, she said, brass eggs had been recently laid, much 
to the dismay of some adult readers in the high school community. And, she 
said, principal Joseph Caldera was like the farmer whose natural instinct was 
to perform surgery on the ailing goose. 
</P>
<P>
But, she said, that cure could very well kill the goose. 
</P>
<P>
Luecke said she then drafted a statement that seemed to reflect the group's 
consensus. It said that Mary Ellen MacArthur, who heads the English Department, 
would resume her role as newspaper adviser, a position she reluctantly resigned 
a week earlier. It also said that Caldera would not review articles before they 
are published. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fit to Print 
</P>
<P>
These assurances were based on pledges that the staff and adviser of The 
Eagle's Eye would better police themselves on determining what is fit to print. 
</P>
<P>
One of the controversial stories that was printed advocated the position that 
students should be able to choose whether to recite the pledge to the American 
flag. Another article, written by a black student, used colloquialisms and 
dialect. 
</P>
<P>
"There were very strong feelings on both sides," said Luecke. "It was really 
admirable the way that everyone essentially buried the hatchet." 
</P>
<P>
"(Luecke) wore her hat as a parent well," said Caldera, but she was fair to 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Only days before the meeting, there was talk of publishing an underground 
newspaper. Lawyers sought out MacArthur with advice on First Amendment law and 
proposals on how to seek a court order to block any censorship. 
</P>
<P>
Cartoons were circulated with unfavorable portraits of the principal. And even 
though the newspaper staff had nothing to do with it, some students briefly 
disrupted classes with a walkout on March 2. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Press Conference 
</P>
<P>
That same day, the student journalists, to the consternation of the principal, 
called a press conference to discuss the matter. Hundreds of students signed 
petitions in support of the newspaper. And all 31 staffers pledged not to help 
edit, or write for, a censored periodical. Caldera vowed that the newspaper 
would continue to publish. 
</P>
<P>
There were pleas for resolution from Amy Bauer, president of the 
parent-teacher-student association, and from school board President James 
McBath who had proposed a bringing in an outside mediator. 
</P>
<P>
Compromise had seemed impossible, yet on Tuesday agreement came from all 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers union president Saul Glickman and California Teachers Assn. official 
Robin Rose, who were representing MacArthur's interests; Deputy Supt. Philip J. 
Linscomb; faculty representative Janean Preston; attendance dean Betty 
Harrison; editor and student body president Matt Luecke; MacArthur and Caldera 
agreed they wanted to end the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
The joint statement they released said: "All parties agree that the primary 
goal is the quality of education of students, including their full First 
Amendment rights of freedom of speech, balanced with responsible, voluntary, 
self-policing of potentially volatile issues." 
</P>
<P>
As part of the agreement, everyone agreed to restrict public comments to ensure 
that fragile feelings not be bruised further. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy erupted last month when Caldera began to get complaints from 
parents and school staff members about articles in The Eagle's Eye. 
</P>
<P>
Two opinion page articles were mentioned in their complaints. 
</P>
<P>
One, in the Jan. 27 issue, expressed the views of a student who thought that 
reciting the Pledge of Allegiance should be optional. In a subsequent issue, 
however, the opposite viewpoint was taken. The topic carries special 
significance for Marshall since the school, with an enrollment of 1,350 
students from 6th through the 12th grade, has always placed an emphasis on 
citizenship and traditional educational values, Caldera said. 
</P>
<P>
The other article, in the Feb. 24 issue, was a fantasy. The story centered on 
why the writer was late for class. The article used dialect, colloquialisms and 
misspellings to create a style that mirrors black dialect, including the words 
dat, dem, spear-throwin' cannibals and homeboy. 
</P>
<P>
The author, newspaper staff member Michael Comas, defended himself by saying 
that's the way he talks sometimes. "Who is to say what is proper?" he said, 
adding that the story was never meant to be taken as a racial slur. 
</P>
<P>
Other blacks on the multiracial newspaper staff supported his viewpoint, 
including Scott Sudduth, a student leader who was recently honored by the 
County Board of Supervisors for a speech he gave entitled, "I Am a Black Man." 
</P>
<P>
The most emotional moment at Tuesday's meeting, according to Marcia Luecke, 
centered around the racial issue. It was clear, she said, that there is a 
generation gap between black students and their elders. 
</P>
<P>
"These older people lived through a time of serious prejudice in our country," 
said Luecke, who is white. 
</P>
<P>
"The young people, and it's a wonderful testament to what's going on at 
Marshall, are apparently colorblind. (Black students) don't feel victims of 
racial prejudice." Nor, she said, did black students feel threatened by Comas' 
article. "What they see is the literary integrity, the wit and the humor." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, she said, the use of dialect upset some blacks on the school 
staff and others in the city who "were touched by the memories of past 
prejudice." 
</P>
<P>
Dean Harrison, who is black, spoke on behalf of those who had complained. 
Luecke said she made "a very moving statement about how blacks may react when 
they see misspellings of words indicating mispronunciation." That usage, she 
said, triggers the memory of times when non-blacks ridiculed the way some 
blacks spoke. 
</P>
<P>
MacArthur, who is white, told the group how her mother, a school principal in 
Monrovia, worked for racial integration in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
The openness in the meeting "was beautiful," Luecke said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Caldera said he did not want to discuss the details of the 
meeting or MacArthur's brief resignation. "I'm afraid we might get into my 
interpretation . . . and in doing so, invite polarization." Caldera, a Latino, 
came to Marshall last year from South Gate Junior High School, where he was an 
assistant principal. 
</P>
<P>
"If the perception is that I lost, then let it be. But I know that I acted in 
the best interest of the entire community." 
</P>
<P>
Although the fire of the controversy is out, "there are some coals that are 
still warm," Caldera said, alluding to continuing racial tension. One faculty 
member said that despite the agreement, "there are some very nasty, leftover 
feelings of racial unrest" among the faculty and staff. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to make a learning situation out of this," Caldera said. "The 
important thing right now is how do we heal."

BROKER FORECASTS AVERAGE SELLING PRICE OF $1 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Never mind the traffic. Ignore the tacky shops. Disregard the occasional 
natural disasters. In three years, the average price of a single-family home in 
Malibu will exceed $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Even today, most people can only afford to visit. Reflecting the escalating 
prices of Westside real estate, the cost of living in Malibu jumped 
dramatically in 1988. The average single-family house in the beachfront 
community cost $678,000 last year, a 37% increase from 1987. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Annual Study 
</P>
<P>
However, that amount probably won't land you a beachfront house. The price of 
those properties cost an average of $1.62 million, a 20% jump from 1987. The 
skyrocketing prices were reflected in the tiny jump in overall sales volume. 
Only nine more residential properties were sold in 1988 than in the previous 
year, but the transactions totaled $210 million, up from $149 million the 
previous year. 
</P>
<P>
The figures are based on an annual study of property sales in Malibu conducted 
by real estate broker Dick Lowe, who has been tracking housing sales in the 
coastal community for 11 years. Lowe compiled statistics from other brokers in 
the area, then checked them against Malibu real estate sales recorded by Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, I don't think it's going to get any cheaper," said Lowe, 
principal broker at Malibu Country Realty. "It's no different than it has been 
in the past. It's just becoming increasingly difficult for people to find a 
home in the $400,000 range." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reflects County Trend 
</P>
<P>
Lowe said that although the figures are startling, the sales prices reflect 
escalating home costs throughout the county, particularly in the affluent 
Westside. In fact, the only Malibu real estate that took a dive was commercial 
property -- sales dipped about $3 million to a total of $18 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The study found the biggest gain in the purchases of undeveloped land. A total 
of 258 undeveloped properties were sold last year, compared to 114 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"The increase in the unimproved land sales shows the interest people have in 
finding something here before there's nothing left," Lowe said. "The amount of 
usable land is becoming more and more scarce. The reason people come out here 
is for the open feeling, the open space and the overall country atmosphere. 
Today, it just costs a lot more to purchase it." 
</P>
<P>
Even condominium and mobile home sales continued to rise, from an average of 
$187,000 in 1987 to $235,000 last year, a 25% jump. However, Lowe said that 
although several condominium projects are in the works, the demand for moderate 
housing will far outstrip the supply. 
</P>
<P>
Moderate housing along the Malibu coast has been extinct for years. The 77 
beachfront homes sold last year went for a total of $125 million. 
</P>
<P>
At the rate Malibu real estate is climbing, Lowe estimates that in three years, 
with a modest 10% annual sales increase, the average single-family home by land 
or by sea will cost a minimum of $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the differences about Malibu is that the prices reflect that there are 
a lot of newer homes out here that are being resold," Lowe said. 
</P>
<P>
According to a recent check of the multiple listings used by real estate 
brokers, a buyer could still purchase a home on Las Tunas Beach for $700,000 -- 
a small two-bedroom with 1 1/2 bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
For $679,000, the average price for single-family home in the area, a buyer 
could get a three-bedroom home on six-tenths of an acre above Zuma Beach. It 
doesn't include two full bathrooms, but it does promise an ocean view.

EVICTED ANIMALS GET NEW HOMES IN COUNTY PARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New homes have been found for the rabbits, chickens and ducks that were evicted 
in January from their unofficial refuge in a Marina del Rey flood control 
basin. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Richards, assistant director of the county Department of Animal Care and 
Control, said 355 animals have already been relocated to several county parks. 
Most of the rabbits have been moved to Frank G. Bonelli Regional County Park in 
San Dimas. 
</P>
<P>
Chickens and ducks have been relocated to other parks, including Harbor 
Regional Park in Wilmington and William S. Hart Park in Newhall. Some people 
have adopted animals, after agreeing that they would not be harmed or used as 
food, Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining 500 to 700 animals will be relocated to those same parks, but 
they are being removed gradually, mostly because it is difficult for the 
volunteers to catch them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Relocated by June 
</P>
<P>
"We've tried to catch some of the ducks and geese, but they take off for the 
water right away," said Irene Ashby, a spokeswoman for Marina Sanctuary Inc. 
The nonprofit group of volunteers cares for the animals and is assisting the 
animal control department in gathering them. 
</P>
<P>
Richards said, however, he expects all of the animals to be relocated by June. 
</P>
<P>
"The animals are being removed safely and humanely," he said. "People have put 
a lot of energy into it." 
</P>
<P>
Ashby said her group is pleased that new homes have been found for the animals, 
but is still upset over the decision to remove them. 
</P>
<P>
In January, the Los Angeles County Small Craft Harbor Commission voted 
unanimously to remove the animals from the 10.5-acre Oxford Flood Control 
Basin. Nearby residents had complained of offensive smells and noises, and 
county officials feared that the rabbits' burrowing could undermine the basin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rabbits Multiplied 
</P>
<P>
The animals had been accumulating in the basin for about 10 years, ever since 
some people decided it was a good place to dump unwanted bunnies, baby chicks 
and ducklings that had been given to children for Easter or Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
The animals, particularly the rabbits, quickly multiplied, and the volunteers 
started feeding and caring for them in 1982, providing more than 300 pounds of 
food a day. No one knows how many animals were in the basin, but Richards said 
there may have been as many as 2,500 rabbits and 1,200 chickens and ducks at 
one time. 
</P>
<P>
Ashby said that although the animal population is being reduced weekly, the 
remaining animals must still be fed until they are relocated. She said that 
since the publicized eviction notice, donations to the group have stopped. 
</P>
<P>
"We still need about $106 a day to feed the remaining animals, and we just 
don't have enough money," Ashby said. 
</P>
<P>
(Donations may be sent to Marina Sanctuary, 4130 Wade St., Los Angeles, Calif. 
90066.) 
</P>
<P>
Despite the publicized eviction, people are still dumping animals in the basin. 
With Easter two weeks away, Ashby fears the problem could get worse. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of our volunteers went to a pet store and saw that they are already 
selling bunnies for $2 each," Ashby said. "That's cheaper than buying an Easter 
basket. We figure by Easter night, when the kids grow tired of the animals, 
we'll see a significant increase in dumping." 
</P>
<P>
The county Department of Beaches and Harbors, which oversees the basin, is 
considering installing a second fence about three feet inside of an exterior 
fence to contain any new animals that are dumped. 
</P>
<P>
"That would at least keep the new animals confined in an area and make it 
easier for us to collect them and relocate them," Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
Ashby hopes that the state Legislature will ban the sale of bunnies and baby 
chicks as pets. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's criminal to allow pet store stores to sell bunnies and baby 
chicks," she said. "There are just too many irresponsible people that just 
don't care."

SANTA MONICA LANDS ROLE AS HOST TO MAJOR FILM FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Plans to move the U.S. version of the Cannes Film Festival from Beverly Hills 
to Santa Monica in 1991 is expected to enhance the beach city's budding image 
as an entertainment hub and is expected to bring millions of dollars in 
revenues to local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The American Film Market, an annual nine-day event that was held at the Beverly 
Hilton this year, is an opportunity for independent movie producers to sell 
their films to foreign distributors. Last year, an estimated $350-million worth 
of business was conducted at the market. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 10,000 people attended the event at the Beverly Hilton, said Tim 
Kittleson, executive director of the American Film Market. 
</P>
<P>
Kittleson estimates that participants this year spent $5 million on hotels, 
$3.3 million on meals, $1.5 million on shopping, $1.4 million on parties and 
$600,000 on transportation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Revenues From Taxes 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica collects 1% of all retail sales as the city's portion of the sales 
tax and 10% of hotel room rates. If the same $11.8 million is spent in Santa 
Monica in 1991, the city could collect nearly $600,000 in nine days. 
</P>
<P>
But Santa Monica Mayor Pro Tem David Finkel said he was not motivated by added 
revenues when he suggested to an AFM official that the event be moved to Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"We're developing the Third Street outdoor mall, we're building a series of 
hotels, and I thought that the idea of a major market like this coming into 
town would be just beautiful timing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Finkel said his support for the market, which is coming to Santa Monica in part 
because of the new facilities being built, does not contradict his slow-growth 
philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
"These projects are already coming forward," he said. "I prefer a group like 
AFM coming into Santa Monica to use those facilities." 
</P>
<P>
Finkel said that if development must continue, he prefers that it be arts and 
cultural facilities geared toward nighttime use because it produces less 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"Developing evening uses is not going to be as invasive as office buildings," 
he said. "It's the lesser of two evils." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Businesses Spring Up 
</P>
<P>
In the last year, comedy clubs such as Second City and the Improv have opened 
in Santa Monica. Several critically acclaimed and expensive restaurants have 
also opened in the city, as have several art galleries. 
</P>
<P>
For at least nine days in late February and early March, 1991, the city will 
act as host to the American Film Market. 
</P>
<P>
Through 1994, the market will be based in the Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel, 
which will open in May on Ocean Avenue about two blocks south of the Santa 
Monica Pier. 
</P>
<P>
But Loews will not be the only hotel to benefit from the move. Kittleson said 
participants this year booked more than 1,000 hotel rooms in and around Beverly 
Hills. Since most of the rooms at the Loews will be used for office space 
during the market, visitors will stay at surrounding hotels, including at least 
two other new hotels under construction near the civic auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
The Location Expo, a three-day event connected to the market at which more than 
100 film commissions worldwide meet to promote their locations for films, will 
be also held at the civic auditorium, about a block south of the Loews Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the nearly 1,400 hotel rooms that will be available in Santa 
Monica in 1991, 24 movie screens existing or under construction within walking 
distance of the Loews Hotel was a factor in moving to Santa Monica, Kittleson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
This year, market participants were shuttled from the Beverly Hilton to the 
Cineplex Odeon's 14 screens at the Beverly Center just outside the Beverly 
Hills city limits. But the biggest factor in moving from Beverly Hills to Santa 
Monica, Kittleson said, was parking. 
</P>
<P>
"Parking has gotten worse over the years in Beverly Hills," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica will provide more than 7,000 parking spaces, including lots at the 
civic auditorium, the Third Street Promenade Mall and at the beach, according 
to John Babington, director of conference services for the Santa Monica 
Convention and Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
And although comparisons to Cannes in the south of France are inevitable, 
Kittleson said his market has "better weather, cheaper prices. The only real 
similarity is that now we'll be on the beach, too."

The City Council voted last week against supporting legislation to restrict 
access to semiautomatic assault weapons. However, it unanimously approved a 
resolution urging the state Legislature to require a waiting period for the 
sale of such weapons. The resolution also recommends longer prison terms for 
those who use the guns in crimes. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution, passed by the council at its meeting Monday night, also called 
on the Legislature to permit local law enforcement agencies to issue officers 
weapons comparable to those used by gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"Although it could have been stronger, at least we sent a message," said Mayor 
Donna Smith. "We wanted to call for some accountability for the people who get 
ahold of these weapons and use them." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the council voted 3 to 2 against a motion by Smith to support 
legislative efforts to ban semiautomatic assault weapons. The council majority 
voiced concern that outright prohibition of the weapons would violate citizens' 
constitutional right to bear arms. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution that was passed this week seeks at least a 15-day waiting period 
for purchasers of the weapons to enable police to check a buyer's background. 
The council also demanded legislation that would add five years to the 
sentences of those who use semiautomatic assault weapons in the commission of 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Mark Nymeyer, who opposed the motion for a ban on the weapons, 
hailed the council's actions. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't take weapons away from responsible gun-owners," he said. "We 
addressed the problem of irresponsible people who use these weapons."

ANNUAL BRAVO AWARDS FOR TEACHERS; 
</P>
<P>
3 HONORED FOR INTEGRATING ARTS IN EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Three Southland teachers shared the 1988 Bravo award, given annually by the 
Music Center for outstanding achievement in arts education. 
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony Monday at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the Music Center honored 
Taffy Patton, who incorporates the arts into her sixth-grade curriculum at Vena 
Magnet School in Pacoima, Barrie Becker, who teaches dance at a juvenile court 
school in Los Angeles, and Phila McDaniel, who teaches art at Gardena High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A First 
</P>
<P>
According to Music Center spokeswoman Connie A. Rivera, this was the first time 
in the award's seven-year history that three educators shared the prize. 
Usually two winners are named, one for incorporating the arts into a 
traditional classroom and one for achievement as an arts specialist. This year, 
two arts specialists were honored. 
</P>
<P>
The three winners were chosen from 97 Southland educators nominated by their 
principals. Ten finalists were announced in December. Each finalist was 
observed in the classroom by a panel of judges before the winners were chosen. 
The judges were educators and artists, including a representative from the 
charitable JefferyMelamed Memorial Fund, which sponsors the competition. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the Bravo winners received a statuette designed by artist William 
Crutchfield. The winners also received $500 gift certificates from Robinson's 
and audio equipment from Audiotronics for their schools. 
</P>
<P>
Patton, a Van Nuys resident, has been teaching for nine years. She was cited 
for the creativity with which she integrates the visual and performing arts 
into her Pacoima classroom. 
</P>
<P>
"Taffy inspires us all," Principal Diane Pritchard said. "I have never been in 
her class when the arts were not integrated into the entire program. That's her 
basic concept." 
</P>
<P>
Patton was cited for such imaginative classroom activities as a mock trial of 
Galileo, combining history and science, that her students researched and 
dramatized. In background information Patton supplied to the Bravo award 
committee, she wrote: "The ideal teacher juggles academic skills in one hand 
and whimsical invention in the other." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wards of the Court 
</P>
<P>
Becker, a Pasadena resident and veteran of 13 years in the classroom, teaches 
dance, drama and social studies to students at the Dorothy Kirby Center School, 
a juvenile court school located in a Los Angeles probation camp. Its 100 
students are wards of the court who have been placed there because of 
involvement in criminal acts. 
</P>
<P>
"Arts education is essential for the full growth and development of every human 
being," Becker wrote to the Bravo award committee. "The last thing a student 
has on his mind upon entering Kirby Center is taking a dance class. But, 
hopefully, by the end of his stay, it will be among the first." 
</P>
<P>
A teacher for 33 years, Rancho Palos Verdes resident McDaniel was cited for her 
ability to help students realize their artistic potential. She was also lauded 
for her campaign to create an art museum on the Gardena campus, with the 
school's extensive collection of paintings by California artists, collected 
since 1919, at its core. Also cited was her pioneering research on the folk art 
of the minority populations of China. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sincerely believe that the arts are basic to all educational programs at 
all levels of schooling and that art is not a frill, but truly the heart of 
education," McDaniel wrote to the award committee. The Bravo award was "a huge 
thrill," she said.

CALTECH GRAD'S DONATION HONORS LATE PROFESSOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An alumnus of the California Institute of Technology has given the school $1.5 
million to fund a professorship honoring late faculty member Richard B. 
Feynman. 
</P>
<P>
The donor, Michael Scott, a 1965 Caltech graduate, was a student of Feynman, 
who was both a Nobel Laureate in theoretical physics and a best-selling 
autobiographer. 
</P>
<P>
Feynman, who was on the Caltech faculty for 38 years, died last year at the age 
of 69. A charismatic teacher and brilliant scientist, Feynman added to his 
reknown as a member of the presidential committee investigating the Challenger 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
While television cameras rolled, Feynman plunged an O-ring like the one that 
failed during the tragic shuttle flight into a glass of ice water and 
demonstrated how cold impaired its resilience. Ultimately, the committee 
attributed the catastrophe to O-ring failure caused by low temperatures at the 
launch site. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, who lives in Sunnyvale in Northern California, was the first president 
of Apple, the pioneering personal computer company. He first encountered 
Feynman as a freshman in 1961. Feynman was developing a new course that was to 
revolutionize the way physics is taught in colleges, a course that would 
eventually be called "Feynman physics." 
</P>
<P>
On the first day of class, Scott recalled, "in the hall, there were 183 new 
freshman and a bowling ball hanging from the three-story ceiling to just above 
the floor. Feynman walked in, and without a word, grabbed the ball and backed 
against the wall with the ball touching his nose. He let go, and the ball swung 
slowly 60 feet across the room and back -- stopping naturally, just short of 
crushing his face. Then he took the ball again, stepped forward, and said: 'I 
wanted to show you that I believe in what I'm going to teach you over the next 
two years." 
</P>
<P>
Scott, 46, said he wished "particularly to recognize Feynman's genius as a 
teacher." Scott will not participate in the selection of the new professor, but 
Caltech President Thomas E. Everhart said the candidates' teaching ability will 
be an important consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Scott said his memories of Feynman include evenings the physicist spent 
visiting students in their campus residences. 
</P>
<P>
"He would come and have dinner and afterwards he would play the bongo drums 
and, unofficially, teach people how to pick locks." Feynman had taught himself 
how to pick locks and crack safes while working for the United States 
government on the top-secret Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic 
bomb.

UNOPPOSED MOLINA'S 1989 CAMPAIGN: HIKE VOTER REGISTRATION IN 1ST DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY, Times City-County Bureau Chief 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gloria Molina is running against nobody. So the Los Angeles city councilwoman 
has put her money and effort into registering voters in a poor, predominantly 
Latino district that has the city's lowest political participation. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody is not a disparaging term directed at nonentity candidates. Literally 
nobody signed up to run against the confrontation-minded, 5-foot-tall city 
lawmaker whose blunt, no-compromise style has upset colleagues and the Bradley 
Administration in her two years on the council. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I'm the only one, I could have just put up lawn signs," Molina said on a 
recent Saturday at her North Figueroa Street storefront campaign headquarters. 
"But there are a lot of ineligible voters here, a lot of 18-year-olds, a lot of 
people becoming citizens." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coffee, Cookies, Cakes 
</P>
<P>
About 20 people, Anglos and Latinos, were there. Some brought their children. 
They played, even during her brief talk. Plates of cakes and cookies from a 
Mexican bakery were laid out on a counter, along with coffee and apple juice. 
</P>
<P>
A map of the 1st District was on the wall, the precinct walkers' guide. 
Campaign director Kit-Bacon Gressit organized the supporters and chatted with 
reporters, occasionally checking on her baby, who was alternately sleeping in a 
stroller and being held by Molina aide Alma Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
The good-humored family feeling was deceptive. In trying to increase voter 
registration, which ends Monday, Molina was striking at a serious problem in 
the inner-city district she has represented since May, 1987. For the future, 
Molina's name comes up as a possible candidate for mayor. But this year, her 
sights are on her home base. 
</P>
<P>
Lack of political power has been the story of this area, home of upwardly 
striving professionals on Mt. Washington, affluent empty-nesters in Bunker Hill 
condominiums, Latino working-class families in Highland Park and thousands of 
impoverished immigrants in small houses and apartments around Westlake Park, 
and in Pico-Union, where the Santa Monica and Harbor freeways meet. 
</P>
<P>
There are only 36,556 registered voters in a population of 224,070. By 
contrast, the 11th District, on the affluent and politically active Westside, 
has 118,976 registered voters in a population of 215,705. More than 68% of the 
1st District's residents are Latino, while the 11th District is 88% Anglo. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Trend 
</P>
<P>
Those numbers provide graphic evidence of a Los Angeles trend that has 
disturbed political scientists and those concerned with minority political 
participation: While the population is becoming more minority and poor, the 
electorate is becoming more affluent and Anglo. That is because low 
participation by immigrant-heavy and fast-growing Latinos and Asians is 
swinging the political balance to predominantly white and affluent areas on the 
Westside and the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
A 1987 study for The Times by Caltech political scientist Bruce E. Cain found 
that 59% of the voters live in the city's whitest and wealthiest districts. 
These districts contain just 48% of the city's population. 
</P>
<P>
The imbalance in political power was graphically shown in last year's city vote 
to defeat oil drilling in the Pacific Palisades. Oil drilling lost in both the 
1st District and the Westside's 11th District. But 88,881 votes were cast in 
the 11th and only 20,736 in the 1st. 
</P>
<P>
That point is central to a pamphlet that was being distributed by Molina 
registration teams going door to door in Highland Park. 
</P>
<P>
"Our community remains the most under-represented in the city and the state," 
Molina said in the pamphlet. 
</P>
<P>
"This means that when it comes time to place an unpopular and dangerous project 
in our district, like prisons or a toxic waste incinerator and oil pipelines in 
a neighborhood, our neighborhood gets chosen. We simply do not have enough 
registered voters to fight back at the ballot box." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outside Allies Needed 
</P>
<P>
She referred to three projects that stirred district residents to intense -- 
but sometimes ineffective -- political activity. One was a proposed state 
prison in East Los Angeles, which was approved despite residents' objections. 
The second was a proposed incinerator in nearby Vernon, which has been delayed 
because of opposition. The third was a proposed oil pipeline through the city, 
which was dropped in the face of public outcry. Significantly, opposition to 
the incinerator and the pipeline came from several affected areas outside the 
1st District. But in the case of the prison, when district opponents had no 
outside allies, they lost. 
</P>
<P>
Low voter participation adds to a problem faced by all Los Angeles 
neighborhoods: Each council district is divided into two or more legislative 
districts. That makes it difficult for areas to get help from Sacramento in a 
time when localities are increasingly dependent on state assistance. 
</P>
<P>
In the high-voting, politically active Westside, the division is not as 
important. Legislators there are bound together in the political operation 
headed by Democratic Reps. Henry Waxman and Howard Berman, which has close ties 
to Westside Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky of the 5th District. Yaroslavsky is an 
ally of Westside Councilman Marvin Braude of the 11th District. 
</P>
<P>
That all-in-the-family arrangement is not the case with Molina's district. Her 
district is split among three Assembly districts. But it is not the major 
portion of any of the legislative districts. Thus political influence is 
lessened in Sacramento, a condition made worse by the fact that Molina, when in 
the Assembly, was a foe of Speaker Willie Brown. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeking an Advantage 
</P>
<P>
Alan Heslop, of the Rose Institute of Claremont McKenna College, said the 
carving up of the 1st District is an example of how reapportionment leaders 
divide communities so their own political teams can gain advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"State legislators will do their damnedest to split up communities," Heslop 
said. "They don't want a leader to come out of that home base." 
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, the area was not even unified into a council district 
until the U.S. Justice Department, insisting that the city was disenfranchising 
Latinos, forced the creation of a Latino district in 1987 to comply with the 
Voting Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to have a council member representing the central section of Los 
Angeles for many years resulted in neglect to streets, parks and other 
facilities, Molina said. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the neglect in the area, Molina said: "There were times in the last 
two years when I wouldn't even vote for myself. . . . But little by little, 
things have improved." 
</P>
<P>
The neglect was clear later that Saturday in the Pico-Union area, where Molina 
visited a group of men and women engaged in a neighborhood cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
It was on 23rd Street, between Washington and Adams boulevards. The beautiful 
old buildings on the campus of Mt. St. Mary's College attested to the former 
elegance of the neighborhood, but most of the buildings in the area were 
run-down when Raymond Chandler was writing about them in the '30s and '40s. 
Rents, according to nearby residents, are about $450 a month for a one-bedroom 
apartment. Residents say three or four families live in such apartments, with 
the landlords charging the extra families, living there illegally, $50 a 
person. 
</P>
<P>
Near the college was an oil field, surrounded by a brown-painted cinder block 
wall covered with the graffiti of the local gangs -- Southside 13, Dead End, 
the Harpys, Little Locos and the new Salvadoran gang, MS. A lawn littered with 
bottles and fast-food store refuse and a tall chain-link fence were between the 
wall and the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Organized Neighbors 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Patsy Carter, a lawyer who owns a five-unit apartment in the 
neighborhood, got sick of the neglect and went door to door, organizing a group 
called the 23rd Street Neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
On the recent Saturday, the neighbors had cleaned about six blocks, picking up 
refuse, painting over graffiti, arranging garbage so it could be picked up. 
Working with them were two Los Angeles police officers who patrol the area, 
Gary Couso, the department's neighborhood liaison there, and Dave Harris. 
Children helping with the cleanup were given rides in their patrol cars. 
</P>
<P>
But, said Carter, they could not remove the graffiti from the oil field wall. 
The chain link fence kept them out and efforts to get help from the owner, she 
said, had been unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
As the members of the 23rd Street Neighbors chatted after their cleanup, they 
made it clear that the oil field, surrounded by the ugly wall, was a symbol of 
their lack of power. Similar installations on the Westside, they noted, were 
well-tended by oil companies under constant pressure from City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
To Molina, increasing voter registration will increase power, making citywide 
candidates and legislators more responsive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1st CITY COUNCIL DISTRICT 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles' 1st City Council District, in the heart of central Los Angeles, is 
the second-poorest of the 15 council districts. Although the district includes 
fashionable Mt. Washington, the Music Center and Dodger Stadium and the 
expensive condos and apartments of Bunker Hill, it is defined mostly by its 
</P>
<P>
more populous southern part, miles of apartments and converted homes from the 
Hollywood Freeway south to the Santa Monica Freeway, packed with Latino 
immigrant families, many of them large, beginning the long climb from deepest 
poverty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Population 224,070 
</P>
<P>
Latino Residents 68.4% 
</P>
<P>
Mexican Descent Latinos 51.6% 
</P>
<P>
The poverty of the district can be seen when compared to Los Angeles' 
wealthiest City Council District, the 11th, which includes the high-priced 
Westside neighborhoods of Brentwood and Pacific Palisades.

IT ALL BEGAN WITH A 'FRIENDLY' LAWSUIT . . . ;

WHODUNIT REVEALS INNER TURMOIL OF A WEALTHY FAMILY

Libby Keck was distraught as she stood in the conservatory of her $42-million, 
treasure-filled Bel-Air mansion. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at that!" she shrieked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, ma'am," her bodyguard and chauffeur, Roger Paine, replied hesitantly. 
</P>
<P>
Sensing his uncertainty, Keck led him by the hand to a painting and ran his 
fingers across its surface. 
</P>
<P>
It was as smooth as glass. Paine knew right away that it was no Impressionistic 
oil painting but a high-quality color photograph. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, hell! Somebody has stolen this painting," he concluded. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it! I know it!" said Keck, her hands still shaking. "It's gone!" 
</P>
<P>
On that afternoon in August, 1987, which was later relived by the two in Los 
Angeles Superior Court, it hardly seemed likely that Keck had touched off a 
scandal that would titillate the world of fine arts from Los Angeles to the 
Louvre. The painting's disappearance led to the prosecution of the Keck family 
butler on a grand theft charge last year. 
</P>
<P>
But a jury refused to believe the butler did it, and what ensued is a whodunit 
that also has raised questions about the veracity of Elizabeth Avery Keck, 
matriarch of one of America's leading philanthropic families. 
</P>
<P>
The painting's disappearance also flung open the curtains on the war among the 
Kecks, heirs to an immense oil fortune, as they hurled charges and 
countercharges of betrayal, theft, family jealousies, illegitimacy and, behind 
it all, pure greed. 
</P>
<P>
Court battles in the internecine combat have already cost members of the Keck 
family well over $12 million in legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
It all began when Howard and Libby Keck's oldest child, Howard B. Keck Jr., or 
"Little Howard," filed a "friendly" lawsuit in 1983 to clarify inheritance 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
At stake were hundreds of millions of dollars as well as the world-renowned 
collection of priceless French objets d'art that fill La Lanterne, the 
11,000-square-foot Stone Canyon mansion that Libby Keck, a lifelong 
Francophile, designed and named after a pavilion in the park at Versailles. 
</P>
<P>
But the trust litigation quickly degenerated into no-holds-barred warfare among 
the Keck family members that left lawsuits strewn from Los Angeles to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
The acrimony also led to a messy divorce between the Kecks in which "Big 
Howard" questioned the paternity of "Little Howard." 
</P>
<P>
Libby Keck said her husband at one point even threatened to "go out and have 
more children" and maybe adopt the entire Marlborough School for girls to 
dilute the inheritance of the next generation of Kecks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Torn Family to Shreds' 
</P>
<P>
"This thing has really torn our family absolutely to shreds," Libby Keck said 
with a sigh of resignation. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing's absolutely, absolutely off the wall -- the whole thing. 
We're all kind of in a limbo," she added. "The family's all blown apart. 
Everybody's just sort of stunned." 
</P>
<P>
Other Keck family members refused to be interviewed. Especially adamant in 
refusing to comment was Howard Keck Sr., even though his lawyer was advised 
that many of his kin, including his ex-wife, had ugly things to say about him. 
Even Libby Keck, who sat for two interviews in her lawyer's office, abruptly 
withdrew, terminating all contact. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's afraid to talk. Even the little children are afraid," she rued. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, Libby Keck has remained an active if stoic player in the local 
art and museum scene, serving on the boards of the County Museum of Art, the 
Museum of Contemporary Art, the Huntington Museum and the Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
Board members say her personal problems have not come up. "We've never 
discussed Mrs. Keck's situation. She has been a very satisfactory trustee," 
said Los Angeles attorney Frederick M. Nicholas, chairman of the Museum of 
Contemporary Art board. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the art world, sports fans, too, might recognize the Keck name. She 
owns Ferdinand, the thoroughbred that won the Kentucky Derby in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Libby Keck is best known as a world-class collector who has assembled a 
museum-quality treasure of French tapestries, paintings and exquisite 
furnishings once owned by the likes of Louis XIV, Marie Antoinette and 
Napoleon. 
</P>
<P>
In happier days, La Lanterne, a walled estate on Bellagio Road, was a regular 
stop for curators from Europe's finest museums, many of whom had competed with 
Libby Keck for those precious objects. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Keck Sr., 73, sponsored cars that won the Indy 500 in 1953 and 1954. He 
retired as chairman of Superior Oil Co. in 1984 after it was purchased by Mobil 
for $5.7 billion, a sale triggered by a dispute with his late sister, 
Willametta. 
</P>
<P>
The Keck family fortune can be traced to William M. Keck Sr., a one-time candy 
and sandwich salesman on the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oil Firm Is Born 
</P>
<P>
Early this century, he went into the oil business as a roustabout in 
Pennsylvania. Eventually, he made his way to California and, as a speculator, 
drilled wells on contract for big oil companies, often taking leases as payment 
instead of cash. 
</P>
<P>
By 1921, Keck had accumulated enough leases to start his own firm, Superior Oil 
Co. Within a decade, it had wells in Texas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Louisiana and 
Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
Keck died in 1964, leaving most of his estate to his three surviving children 
through the $640-million William M. Keck Foundation, one of California's 
largest private grant-making foundations. He also left five beneficiary trusts 
set up at USC, Stanford, Pomona College, Occidental College and the Church of 
Our Savior in San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
As the family became increasingly mired in litigation, some feared the 
hostilities would adversely affect the foundation's charitable giving, which 
over the years has totaled tens of millions of dollars to museums, schools, 
churches and community programs throughout the country. But those concerns have 
been allayed. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the foundation put up $70 million to build a state-of-the-art 
telescope in Hawaii. And last year, the foundation's grants totaled more than 
$34 million. In January, the foundation awarded $5.3 million to KCET Channel 28 
to produce a six-part series on astronomy. 
</P>
<P>
The family trusts came into being in 1978 after a 14-year probate over Keck's 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sibling Rivalry 
</P>
<P>
His children never got along well, according to some of the Kecks. Initially, 
William M. Keck Jr. was installed as Superior's chief executive officer. But 
Howard B. Keck Sr., or "Big Howard," eventually wrested control of the company 
away from his brother. 
</P>
<P>
"The reasons they didn't get along go back to childhood," explained Libby Keck. 
Their father baited the brothers and encouraged the rivalry, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Such intense competition, Libby Keck said, later also poisoned Big Howard's 
relationship with his own son, Little Howard. It was as if her husband had 
transferred that sibling rivalry from his brother to his son, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"As it happened, our son was born on Bill's birthday," Libby Keck said. Little 
Howard even had the same, straight brown hair as Big Howard's brother. "And so 
he (Big Howard) was jealous of his son from Day 1." 
</P>
<P>
Willametta Keck, Howard's sister, was also not immune to sibling rivalry. When 
they were children, Howard killed her pet ostrich by stuffing an orange down 
its throat, according to one well-told family story. Later, Howard sent 
Willametta's children to work at a refinery in Alaska -- out of spite, said 
Libby Keck. 
</P>
<P>
Willametta was seriously ill in Santa Barbara when Howard dispatched emissaries 
who urged her to grant him sole control of the trusts set up by their father. 
She refused, calling her brother a "dumb son of a bitch" in the Wall Street 
Journal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proxy Fight 
</P>
<P>
Their dispute prompted Willametta, who died shortly afterward, to start a 
successful proxy fight against her brother, which triggered the 1984 sale of 
Superior to Mobil Corp. for $5.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
It was after that sale that Little Howard filed his lawsuit to clarify the 
complex inheritance issues involving the family trusts. 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents, income from the trusts was to be distributed to 
the grandchildren of the patriarch, William Sr. And the trusts themselves were 
to terminate with the death of his last surviving child with all assets to be 
divided among the living descendants. Big Howard now is the sole surviving 
child of William Sr. 
</P>
<P>
But Little Howard's "friendly" lawsuit proved anything but amicable. 
</P>
<P>
In and out of court, Big Howard and Little Howard became increasingly hostile 
toward one another. At one point, Libby Keck said, Big Howard vowed to bring 
his son "to his knees." 
</P>
<P>
Such enmity hardly surprised her. 
</P>
<P>
Libby Keck said her son always "idolized his father. He killed himself to be 
everything his father wanted him to be." But it was never enough. His father 
wanted him to become a geologist; instead, he studied economics and finance at 
USC and Pepperdine. Later, Big Howard sent his son to northern Canada and then 
to Africa -- assignments that scared her son "to death," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Just a Prelude' 
</P>
<P>
"He (Big Howard) sent him as far away as he could. He didn't want the threat of 
a son or an heir-apparent around," she said. "So we always fought over that. 
But I never dreamed for an instant that it would blow up in the end the way it 
did. All that was just a prelude." 
</P>
<P>
Big Howard was a fabulous provider, according to Libby Keck, and his children 
had "every advantage known to man" -- private airplanes, limousines, ski 
vacations, tennis camps, surprise black-tie parties, hunting lodges. 
</P>
<P>
Yet they were all afraid of their father, she said. Big Howard's relationship 
with his other children -- two daughters and a stepdaughter -- also were less 
than smooth, Libby Keck said. 
</P>
<P>
As the father-son lawsuit progressed, the Keck daughters began taking sides. 
One of them, Kerry C. Vaughn, joined Little Howard's lawsuit. But the other 
daughter, Erin Anner Lower, and stepdaughter Francesca Elizabeth Drown joined 
Big Howard, alleging that Little Howard is not the biological child of Big 
Howard -- "based on recently discovered evidence." But according to Sorrell 
Trope, Libby Keck's divorce lawyer, that issue has been laid to rest through 
genetic analysis. 
</P>
<P>
Married for more than 38 years, the estranged Kecks continue to live -- 
separately, rarely 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gag Order 
</P>
<P>
Until 1988, little was known about the deepening Keck family misery because 
much of the litigation was inaccessible to the public. Throughout the trust 
litigation, a Texas judicial gag order prevailed. And even though the 
litigation has been settled out of court, most of the documents remain sealed 
and its participants have signed a confidentiality agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the Kecks' divorce proceedings in Los Angeles Superior Court have 
been sealed at their mutual request. 
</P>
<P>
But all that secrecy began to crack in August, 1987, after Libby Keck 
instructed Paine, her bodyguard-chauffeur, to summon Los Angeles Police 
Department detectives to investigate the disappearance of a painting in La 
Lanterne's conservatory. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out that the century-old painting, "I Fria Luften," (In Free Air) a 
nude of a mother and child by Swedish master Anders Zorn, had fetched nearly 
$500,000 at a Swedish auction that spring. 
</P>
<P>
It is not disputed that the Kecks' then-butler, Roy Donell, had received the 
proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
Charged with grand larceny, Donell proclaimed his innocence before a Los 
Angeles Superior Court jury, saying he had acted at Libby Keck's behest because 
she needed money to pay her lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Black Lies' 
</P>
<P>
Donell said he turned over the proceeds to her, minus his 20% commission, in 
installments in white envelopes on her breakfast trays under a napkin. A 
second, minor painting was also allegedly stolen by Donell. 
</P>
<P>
Libby Keck took the witness stand and called Donell's assertions "black lies." 
</P>
<P>
But after a monthlong trial last summer, the jury exonerated Donell. In the 
meantime, the Kecks were paid off by their insurance company, minus a $50,000 
deductible. 
</P>
<P>
It was this criminal trial -- attended by numerous lawyers representing the 
conflicting interests of the many Kecks -- that served to part the curtains on 
the Kecks' private affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Denouncing Donell's claims, the elegantly dressed Libby Keck told the jury: 
"The suggestion that I would conspire with my butler to sell these paintings 
for a sum of money which is but a small fraction of one month's income of 
myself and my husband is ludicrous." 
</P>
<P>
She said she never had any financial worries, noting that she had sole control 
of an $11-million account. "I could have written a check for the whole amount," 
she testified. 
</P>
<P>
A document from the divorce proceedings, produced at Donell's trial, showed 
that she also had a monthly allowance of $5,000 for groceries, $3,300 for 
dinners, $1,200 for lunches, $10,000 for dinner parties and $25,000 for 
clothing and other accessories. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Husband Takes Stand 
</P>
<P>
During final arguments in Donell's criminal trial, Donald Randolph, the 
butler's defense attorney, told the jury that it would come down to Libby 
Keck's word against his client's. "She says X, and he says Y." 
</P>
<P>
It did not help Libby Keck when her husband took the witness stand and told the 
jury that she was not one to be trusted. "I don't think she is a truthful 
person," he testified. 
</P>
<P>
After acquitting Donell, jury foreman Joel Nenzell said the jurors did not 
necessarily believe Donell was innocent -- only that his story seemed more 
believable than Libby Keck's. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his acquittal, Donell is not out of the woods. 
</P>
<P>
Libby Keck has sued him in civil court for theft, slander, invasion of privacy 
and infliction of emotional distress, demanding $31 million. The former butler, 
who earned $25,000 a year, has been representing himself during the pretrial 
machinations. 
</P>
<P>
Libby Keck said she filed the suit to clear her name. 
</P>
<P>
"I want the truth out. I don't want to live with the lies that have been cast 
upon me by the bludgeonings of fate," she said. "Until about three years ago, I 
lived a charmed existence. But now, oh, what a nightmare."

RTD STEPS UP EFFORTS TO LIMIT BUS DAMAGE INFLICTED BY VANDALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL J. YBARRA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the RTD's 1,950-bus fleet plies the streets of Los Angeles, vandals slash, 
cut and rip at the buses' foam-cushioned seats -- damaging about 700 a day, 
causing $400,000 in damage each year. At stops, they jump onto bumpers and, in 
front of helpless drivers, scratch the windshields with knives. 
</P>
<P>
RTD officials said Saturday that vandalism has become so bad that some service 
may be halted. In the meantime, the district has decided to replace the 
cushions with hard plastic seats. 
</P>
<P>
About once a day, a bus has to be taken out of service because its windshield 
is marred to the point where the driver's vision is obscured, said John 
Richeson, associate general manager for the Southern California Rapid Transit 
District. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Out Clean, Back Marred 
</P>
<P>
"We'll send a bus out cleaned and serviced in the morning and it will come back 
in the evening looking like it has never been cleaned," Richeson said, adding 
that the cleaning solvents used to remove graffiti also strip paint from the 
buses. 
</P>
<P>
Richeson said efforts will be made to work with the community and law 
enforcement officials to stem the damage, but lines particularly hard-hit may 
be terminated. The issue will come up for discussion in September, he said, if 
a plan adopted by the district's board of directors Thursday fails to reduce 
the damage. 
</P>
<P>
"The cost is just getting to be astronomical and the damage is worse," Richeson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the problem is no longer just keeping the buses clean -- it's keeping 
them safe as well. 
</P>
<P>
The district's new program includes a hot line and cash rewards for passengers 
who report abuse. But officials stressed that they do not want drivers or 
riders to confront any of the often knife-brandishing vandals. A police task 
force will also be expanded from three officers to 10. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Strategies 
</P>
<P>
"The graffitists continue to come up with new methods to get their job done 
every time we come up with a new way to stop them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Starting this summer, the district will replace the padded seats on 60% of its 
buses with plastic ones. The $3-million effort is expected to save upholstering 
costs, but it will mean less comfort for passengers. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a hard seat; there is no doubt it is a harder seat," Richeson said. "Not 
anything like the 2 1/2 inches of cushion we currently have." The seat 
replacement on 1,355 buses is expected to take almost three years. 
</P>
<P>
Four hundred buses have been in service for nine months with the new 
quarter-inch thick plastic and cloth pad, and little damage has been reported, 
Richeson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the minute we say that, someone is going feel challenged," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rising Costs 
</P>
<P>
The district's anti-graffiti drive has become more expensive in the last four 
years, with more than $8 million now budgeted annually for the effort, eight 
times what it first cost. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, 75 bus-defacers have been caught, most in police stakeouts. 
The offenders were cited and fined $250. 
</P>
<P>
Frequent riders say the new seats may be fine for short jaunts but question 
their comfort on longer rides. 
</P>
<P>
"For someone coming downtown every day it's going to be a pain," said Steven 
Troy, who had taken a bus Saturday from his home in Reseda and was waiting for 
another on Spring Street . 
</P>
<P>
But he didn't think the new seats would deter vandals: "They'll start coming on 
the bus with drills now."

THE STORM OVER ZUBIN MEHTA IN ISRAEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL SCHRAG, Schrag is a free-lance writer in Tel Aviv. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
TEL AVIV 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zubin Mehta was under pressure. With Murray Perahia as soloist, Chopin's Piano 
Concerto No. 1 in E minor on the program of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra's 
concert was being recorded live for release by CBS Records. Each time the 
conductor lifted his arms to begin, however, muffled coughs rose from the 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
By the third or fourth time, the audience greeted each cough with nervous 
laughter. Finally, Mehta turned to face the crowd and said, in a half-joking, 
half-exasperated tone, "Why don't you all cough together?" The audience burst 
into applause, and the program continued. 
</P>
<P>
The concert was the last of a series that Mehta conducted in Israel last month. 
As music director of the IPO for the last 20 years, he makes three annual trips 
here, splitting his other time between a home in Los Angeles and conducting the 
New York Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
Mehta's 20 years in Israel have earned him great popularity among subscribers 
and the general public. During his most recent visit, he appeared on national 
television twice, including a half-hour interview program dedicated to him. 
</P>
<P>
But this personal popularity hasn't muted criticism of the music director. 
Conducting as many as six concerts a week during a three-week run here, he got 
generally poor reviews. In recent months there have been arguments that he has 
overstayed his welcome. 
</P>
<P>
Hanoch Ron is the music critic of Israel's largest mass-circulation daily 
newspaper, Yediot Aharonot. At 52, he is the same age as both Mehta and the 
IPO. He argues that the national orchestra's standards have dropped dangerously 
low since the 1960s, and he puts much of the blame squarely on Mehta's 
shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
Ron acknowledged that the IPO's illustrious beginnings put tremendous pressure 
on anyone who works with it today. Founded in 1936 by Polish-born violinist 
Bronislaw Huberman, the orchestra counted among its early members many 
prominent European Jewish musicians who fled the Nazis and found refuge in what 
was then Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
Arturo Toscanini led the orchestra in its premiere concert in December 1936. He 
welcomed the opportunity to work with the skilled musicians who had gathered in 
Tel Aviv, but he also relished the chance to make a political statement against 
the fascist rule that had forced the orchestra's members out of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans like to say, 'Think big,' " Ron said, "but in the 1930s, nobody 
thought big here." Nevertheless, the IPO took off in a big way. Toscanini was 
followed by a constant stream of leading figures from the music world, 
including a young Leonard Bernstein, who made his first appearance here in 
1947. 
</P>
<P>
Ron charged that the glory days peaked in the 1960s, and that the IPO has been 
on the decline since Mehta became music director in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
"The orchestra has never been in such bad shape as it's in today," the critic 
said. He cited the horns as an example of a weak section. "Mehta feels it. 
Rather than fix it, he brought in an American player, but that has no impact. 
</P>
<P>
"The players are fine," he continued, "but they don't play as a section." The 
IPO needs to spend more time rehearsing, and Mehta should work with each 
section more than he does, the critic said. 
</P>
<P>
Ron charged that Mehta embraces big public spectacles, such as open-air 
concerts with fireworks, which come at the expense of practice and innovative 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he said that Mehta should include more Israeli compositions in the 
IPO's programming. "He doesn't know what's going on here. His connection with 
Israel isn't with culture, it's with gala events and flirting with the nouveau 
riche and the media." 
</P>
<P>
IPO management committee member and principal hornist Yaacov Mishori dismissed 
Ron's criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the orchestra members really like Mehta," Mishori said. "Of course, if 
he decided to leave tomorrow, the orchestra 
</P>
<P>
would survive. 
</P>
<P>
"If it was time for a change," he insisted, "we would have made a change." 
</P>
<P>
Mehta grew visibly upset when asked to comment on Ron's criticism during a 
recent interview. Scoffing at the idea that he enjoys hobnobbing with a wealthy 
crowd, he pointed out that as one of the IPO's leading fund raisers, "It is 
very important that I keep in touch with whatever money there is in this 
country." 
</P>
<P>
The criticism goes deeper than such superficial concerns as to who Mehta's 
friends are. Last October, several newspapers -- including the English-language 
Jerusalem Post -- put forth more fundamental suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
Ron said it this way: "The greatest thing he could do today is say, 'Thank you 
very much,' and leave." 
</P>
<P>
Mehta countered by saying that he takes his orders from the Philharmonic 
members -- who all participate in operations by running it as a cooperative -- 
not from the media. 
</P>
<P>
"There was an opinion expressed in the newspapers that, after 20 years, maybe 
the Israel Philharmonic should consider asking me to leave," Mehta said. "I 
thought they might have a point, so I asked my orchestra. They told me 
overwhelmingly that they wanted me to stay." 
</P>
<P>
In a secret ballot, 80% of the cooperative's members supported Mehta. As far as 
the conductor is concerned, that settled the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Until 1981, Mehta signed a contract with the IPO every three years, and the 
cooperative members had to approve each new contract. This gave them an 
opportunity to voice support for the music director at regular intervals. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, however, the orchestra appointed Mehta music director for life. While 
the members or Mehta are free to cancel the appointment at any time, the 
appointment signaled an end to regular votes of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Ilan Eshed, the orchestra's assistant principal trumpet player since 1967, said 
that last October's vote came as a result of the outside criticism being 
leveled against Mehta and the IPO. 
</P>
<P>
The vote cannot be considered a pure reflection of the orchestra's feelings, 
Eshed and others imply. The tendency to defend their leader against external 
criticism may have skewed the final vote. 
</P>
<P>
Eshed argued that the vote helped the IPO overcome its immediate crisis, but 
did not address the larger challenge of creating systems for internal control. 
</P>
<P>
Eshed was unwilling to go along with the critics' call for Mehta to leave the 
IPO, but acknowledged that the orchestra has a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Our work with Mehta has become too routine," he said, choosing his words 
carefully. After more than a quarter-century together, "We don't see the man's 
greatness anymore, and we don't see the greatness of what we can do with him. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a dream," Eshed revealed. He would like to see Mehta conduct the IPO 
after an absence of a year or two. "That way, I think we would really revel in 
his greatness." 
</P>
<P>
The debate will probably continue for as long as Mehta remains the IPO's music 
director. With 36,000 loyal subscribers, the IPO's world-class reputation and 
an 80% vote of confidence under his belt, Mehta is likely to stay in Israel for 
many more years. 
</P>
<P>
Mehta's ties with the IPO go back to 1961, when he served as guest conductor 
for the first time. Since then, when both he and the orchestra were 25 years 
old, the relationship has spanned several Israeli wars, numerous international 
tours and a fair share of criticism. 
</P>
<P>
Many Israelis view Mehta as an honorary citizen. He returns the compliment, 
saying, "I identify with this country." He admits, however, that he feels 
equally at home in three countries: India, where he was born, the United 
States, where he makes his home, and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
During his tenure in Tel Aviv, he has simultaneously been music director, first 
of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, later of the New York Philharmonic. Since 
announcing his departure from New York in 1991, Mehta has indicated that he 
will not seek the post of music director at any other North American orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
He has no intention of leaving the IPO, which operates as a cooperative -- the 
players manage the orchestra, without recourse to replacing outside boards of 
directors or overseers. 
</P>
<P>
"(The system) has its drawbacks," Mehta acknowledged, especially in the 
financial realm. "We do not have a board of directors who balances our budget," 
he said. The New York Philharmonic ends each year in the black, he said, while 
the IPO struggles every season. 
</P>
<P>
Mehta often steps in to raise money for the orchestra. He sees no alternative; 
the IPO has an endowment of just $5 million, while the New York Philharmonic 
has 10 times that amount. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Jewish Sabbath didn't forbid it, we'd play on Friday night too," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Mehta conducts the IPO in about 90 concerts annually, 60 in Israel and 30 
abroad. He spends 20 weeks per year in New York with his other orchestra. In 
that time, he conducts about 85 times, plus additional performances during five 
weeks of touring. 
</P>
<P>
Mehta said that the hectic schedule he maintains in Israel prevents him from 
having much of an outside life here. His wife remains at home in Beverly Hills 
when he travels to Israel, and he lives at the Tel Aviv Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
"I have friends in the orchestra," he said, when pressed for details about his 
social life in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really not a party person. I'm in the business of working with 100 people 
every day, so I don't revel in meeting a roomful of people in my leisure time." 
</P>
<P>
The current spring tour of the Israel Philharmonic includes concerts Saturday 
in Los Angeles, March 19 in Costa Mesa, March 20 in San Diego and March 21 in 
Palm Desert.

THE STRUGGLE TO OUT-FOX TV'S BIG 3 CONTINUES;

<P>
FOURTH NETWORK'S THIRD NIGHT OF PROGRAMMING MAY BE THE KEY TO ITS FUTURE

<P>
It is 10 o'clock in the morning in Los Angeles, and, as they say in war-room 
lingo, confidence is high. Fox Inc. chairman and CEO Barry Diller, who sets the 
sartorial tone for his troops in an all-business white shirt and peach power 
tie, looks down the long table at the 20 employees he'd hired to make a go of a 
fourth television network, the Fox Broadcasting Co., for Rupert Murdoch's News 
Corp. -- most of them men, most of them hovering near 30, most of them, by 
Diller's own admission, in over their corporate heads. 
</P>
<P>
They are too new at what they are doing, and too full of the pioneer spirit, to 
entertain notions of failure. If a show's ratings increase a single point over 
the previous week, it is cause for rejoicing. If a new promotional spot for the 
popular "21 Jump Street," an hourlong drama about undercover police officers at 
a large public high school, impresses the executives, they enthusiastically 
back Diller's quick decision to buy an additional $250,000 in air time on MTV 
for the ad, even though financial analysts and business writers had been 
speculating on the financial health of the company for months. 
</P>
<P>
This weekly staff meeting -- which is equal parts business meeting and public 
forum -- is unusual for a television network, where departments typically 
function in bureaucratically discrete units. But Diller recognizes the 
therapeutic value of calling his people together and letting them discuss the 
network's performance. As much as anything, the session is designed to revive 
any flagging spirits and restore the momentum needed to climb uphill for 
another week. 
</P>
<P>
Diller, who appreciates the inspirational effects of a little naive optimism, 
does his best to make sure his staff does not dwell on the darker side. "They 
get nervous," he says, "to the point where you spend a great deal of time 
setting the environment, setting the agenda. You create your own mirrors so 
that you can keep the process stable -- even fictionally." It is important that 
everyone believes there are no real problems ahead. Just puzzles to be solved. 
</P>
<P>
So the 46-year-old elder statesman barks orders, interrupts, consults his watch 
and, as the meeting expands beyond the 90 that Diller thinks it deserves, 
begins to yawn loudly. He cannot allow self-confidence to turn into lazy 
self-congratulation: Between May and September, FOX will face its biggest 
challenge and its most ambitious agenda so far. 
</P>
<P>
The network's third night of programming -- which will be announced in May and 
debut on Monday, Sept. 11 -- is the key to the future. A third night has been 
announced and postponed several times before, the false starts always blamed on 
the need to shore up a weak Saturday night line-up before taking on a new 
night. But too many delays begin to look like failure, so FOX is banking on a 
much expanded programming department -- dozens of shows are currently in the 
works -- to supply series that will survive against such hefty competition as 
"Monday Night Football." 
</P>
<P>
As for the still-faltering Saturday night shows, the network hopes to have a 
solution in "Cops," a half-hour "reality show" about police in Florida that was 
scheduled to appear on the Saturday schedule for the first time March 11. In a 
five-night trial run in Los Angeles, "Cops" boosted KTTV to over 20% of the 
viewing audience, a first for an independent station. Fox expects that the show 
will lift the rest of the Saturday ratings in the same way that "21 Jump 
Street," the network's first Sunday night hit, gave a lift to the Sunday 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, April 21, Fox debuts "Revolution," an hourlong music and feature 
show aimed at the MTV audience. And to get viewers into the Monday-night habit, 
on May 8 the network will begin a monthly movie night of FOX features that will 
move to Tuesday in the fall. It is all part of an effort to get beyond two 
nights of flirting with the appealing 18- to 34-year-old market, the 
demographic group advertisers most want to reach. FOX wants to be these 
viewers' steady date. 
</P>
<P>
But FOX's brief history has been an odd one: Its successes have been mostly a 
matter of good luck, its failures often the ironic product of hard work from 
the West Coast staff. The very structure of the company keeps changing as new 
job titles and responsibilities are invented to fill a perceived need. And the 
network has been hobbled from the outset by the decision to start programming 
on two adjacent nights, a move considered necessary to establish a strong 
identity with viewers. 
</P>
<P>
While Sunday night was the most appealing night of the week, Saturday -- when 
that 18-to-34 target audience tends to be away from the television set -- has 
proven to be an overwhelmingly difficult obstacle. Unless Diller can figure out 
how to exploit serendipity -- how to take what he's learned from the successes 
he's stumbled upon and manufacture new kinds of hit shows -- and enforce 
stability among his troops, he could be in trouble again as soon as he launches 
the third night. 
</P>
<P>
He cannot allow smugness to creep into the meeting. When talk about upcoming 
segments of "The Reporters" drags on too long, he breaks it off with the curt 
comment, "the stories have been dreadful." He complains about "The Garry 
Shandling Show" and "Duet," which do well on Sunday nights, but not well enough 
to suit him. And, always impatient for the next good idea, he interrupts 
staffers who talk too much. Diller believes in fostering a spirit of 
professional camaraderie, but he does not believe in complacency. It is much 
too soon for that. 
</P>
<P>
If Barry Diller has his eye on everybody at Fox Broadcasting, Rupert Murdoch, 
in turn, has his eye on Barry Diller. For there is much more at stake here than 
a mere television network. "We're building a loosely integrated global 
communications company," Murdoch says of his News Corp., which owns newspapers, 
magazines and book publishers worldwide, "and it would be nonsense without a 
very firm foot in television." 
</P>
<P>
The Fox Broadcasting Co. (which calls itself FOX to help viewers used to CBS, 
NBC and ABC think of it as a network) is Murdoch's very expensive experiment in 
video entrepreneurship -- a brazen, extravagantly financed effort to compete 
with the three traditional networks. Armed with nothing but resolve and money, 
Murdoch launched FOX in May, 1986. He purchased all the necessary components of 
a national opportunity: Stations ($1.6 billion), a production company to 
provide original programs and a facility to make them ($575 million). The 
stations, and any affiliates FOX could round up, were to be the potential 
profit center for Murdoch; if the network succeeded, the stations' advertising 
revenues would rise simultaneously with a dramatic reduction in programming 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the money flowed in one direction -- out. FOX put "The Late Show With 
Joan Rivers" on the air in October, 1986, and launched two nights of 
programming in 1987, only to lose $99 million in fiscal 1988, almost double its 
initial $50 million estimate. The network expects to lose at least $20 million 
in the current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Prospects looked so glum in June, 1988, that Richard Sarazen, chief financial 
officer at the News Corp., was reported to have said that FOX would be closed 
down in six months unless there was marked improvement. While Murdoch and 
Diller insisted that the remarks had been misinterpreted, skeptics cited the 
dollar losses and programming failures and continued to forecast doom. 
</P>
<P>
But since the debut of the 1988 fall season, Murdoch and Diller have ratings 
that, for the first time, hold a glimmer of promise. In their best time period, 
7 to 9 p.m. on Sundays, they have begun to beat some of the network competition 
-- "21 Jump Street" has maintained its popularity, while "Married . . . With 
Children" and "America's Most Wanted" have dramatically improved ratings. That 
performance, combined with the concentrated demographics, has already enabled 
the network to raise advertising rates. Total advertising revenues for the 
1987-88 fiscal year, which ended June 30, 1988, were about $100 million. 
Revenues for the first four months of this year were $130 million. 
</P>
<P>
None of this makes FOX an apparent direct threat to the networks, not when NBC, 
the number one network, has annual ad revenues of $3.8 billion. FOX simply has 
too few shows on too few stations -- in 10% of the country, there is no FOX 
affiliate -- to compete on an equal basis. But the response to the current 
line-up does suggest that the company has a future as a boutique broadcaster -- 
a narrow-casting network that goes after a smaller, concentrated target 
audience and bases its scaled-down operation on low overhead and inexpensive 
inventory. 
</P>
<P>
If recent changes in the FOX West Coast operation -- all aimed at cutting 
losses and achieving what Diller calls a consistent "personality" -- are 
successful, Murdoch could end up not with a fourth traditional network but with 
the first of a new kind of network, one designed to make the most out of a 
smaller piece of the viewing pie. 
</P>
<P>
To put together a nontraditional network, Diller decided to put together an 
unorthodox staff. Since his days as chairman and CEO of Paramount Pictures, 
Diller has believed in hiring the not-quite-ripe -- he takes credit for 
launching Jeffrey Katzenberg, chairman of the Walt Disney Studios, on his 
meteoric career by promoting him to head of production at Paramount before he 
was quite ready -- so he purposely hired young executives to fill "jobs that 
they are not yet qualified for. This company has an enormous number of very 
talented people who do not have a great deal of experience," he says. "What you 
get out of that is freshness, you get energy. The price you pay is that you 
sometimes don't have the maturity that is necessary, and the basic experience." 
</P>
<P>
But Diller's primary concern was with getting product on the air, fast, so he 
opted for enthusiasm over know-how, hiring Jamie Kellner, a film executive who 
had never worked in network television, to be Fox Broadcasting president. Garth 
Ancier, who appraised his previous seven years at NBC as "a solid track record, 
nothing amazing," joined as senior vice president of programming, and Kevin 
Wendle became an executive after only a year and a half at NBC and 10 years in 
local television. 
</P>
<P>
Both Ancier and Wendle had been trained by NBC Entertainment President Brandon 
Tartikoff, who espoused a programming philosophy based on buying the services 
of already-proven producers. It was a pricey way to start doing business, but 
it looked to Diller to be fairly low-risk, since a proven producer would be 
likelier to deliver a successful show than would a less experienced, less 
expensive one. Ancier and Wendle mixed their mentor's approach with their new 
boss' predilection for betting on people's potential, and, according to Ancier, 
went after "second- or third-level people" who may have worked on -- but had 
not created -- a hit series. 
</P>
<P>
The FOX executives let the Hollywood creative community know that they were 
looking for what Diller called "alternative programming" -- shows that might 
seem too controversial to the networks, but would attract younger viewers bored 
with the standard fare. To get producers to work with a speculative venture 
such as FOX, they offered incentives: more creative control, and a financially 
remunerative combination of competitive fees and definite on-air commitments. 
Because the standard program development process includes network involvement 
and does not necessarily lead to a prime-time series, the promise of freedom 
and a time slot was seductive. 
</P>
<P>
"One reason we were attracted in the first place," says Mitch Semel, vice 
president and executive in charge of production at UBU Productions, the company 
that produces the half-hour comedy "Duet" for FOX, "is that we got an immediate 
on-air commitment for 13 episodes. We didn't have to go through development and 
making a pilot; we knew from the get-go we had 13." The inherent risk was that 
the network would have to meet contractual obligations even on canceled shows. 
</P>
<P>
But the pay-off in terms of independent station interest and advertiser 
response was worth the gamble. Original programming from well-known producers 
was the one thing that could elevate a marginal independent into a more 
lucrative, competitive position. 
</P>
<P>
Kellner offered them shows from UBU Productions, Stephen Cannell ("The A-Team," 
"The Rockford Files"), James L. Brooks ("Terms of Endearment") and Ed. 
Weinberger ("Taxi," "The Mary Tyler Moore Show"). What he wanted in return was 
eight minutes of advertising spots per hour for FOX, leaving only three for 
local sales. But the potential increase in ad revenues was so great that the 
independents still stood to make more money. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are a little UHF station in the 116th largest market in the United 
States, and suddenly you are a FOX affiliate, the perception of you, 
particularly in the buying and selling of advertising, has totally changed 
overnight," says Steve Bell, senior vice president and general manager of KTLA, 
the Tribune Broadcasting-owned independent station that competes with the 
FOX-owned KTTV in Los Angeles. "You're no longer considered a schlocky UHF 
independent, because advertising agencies do tend to favor affiliates over true 
independents." 
</P>
<P>
One year after the announcement of the network's formation, in April, 1987, FOX 
launched a Sunday night prime-time schedule. Three months later, FOX began 
programming on Saturday night and by the fall had four situation comedies in 
place to compete directly with NBC's strong Saturday night comedy line-up. "We 
wanted to go very fast," says Diller of what he, and his staff, now consider to 
have been a somewhat hasty debut. 
</P>
<P>
"We took the best five shows and premiered Sunday night," says Wendle. "We took 
the next best four and premiered Saturday." There was no contingency plan in 
case of disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Which is exactly what they got. The Sunday night schedule, anchored by the 
relatively successful "21 Jump Street," did not meet the projected national 
ratings figure. The Saturday night shows dipped as low as 2 in the national 
ratings and refused to budge despite a revolving door lineup. In the meantime, 
FOX's experiment in late-night programming, "The Late Show With Joan Rivers" -- 
meant as a direct challenge to NBC's Johnny Carson, a contest between Carson 
and his most popular substitute host -- had developed into "The Late Show" with 
a series of different hosts, and then into another format entirely, none of 
which worked. 
</P>
<P>
In October, 1988, FOX's late-night programming disappeared. "We auditioned on 
the air to find an idea, and we failed," says Diller, who says he is relieved 
to be out of the late-night business. "I said to my colleagues, 'We don't have 
a valid idea, and until we get a valid idea, we should say, 'We're going home 
from this area, and we'll be back when we have something to say.' " Rivers did 
have a 3-year, $10-million contract, however, which the network had to pay off. 
</P>
<P>
The Fox Broadcasting Co. made two basic errors of calculation in its short 
spring, 1987, season and the full 1987-88 season: For all the talk of 
alternative programming, the network served up Saturday night programs almost 
identical to the competition, and it underestimated the difficulty in luring 
viewers to their local affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
'You look back and say, 'My God, how could we have been so stupid?,' " says 
Wendle. "But at the time it was easy to rationalize. You say, 'The networks 
have all these viewers, so clearly the viewers on Saturday night want comedy.' 
" And dissatisfied viewers seemed unwilling to give FOX a second chance, so its 
replacement shows did just as badly. 
</P>
<P>
The network's more popular Sunday night programs also failed to live up to 
ratings projections, but for a different reason -- station anonymity, despite 
$20 million spent on advertising, promotion and publicity. Many viewers simply 
were not familiar with the small FOX affiliate in their area. "In our darkest 
hour so far we said to ourselves, 'They don't know where our stations are,' " 
says Diller. "We put on an idea we think is a good idea, they don't find it. . 
. . We couldn't get growth no matter what we did." 
</P>
<P>
The network paid for its mistakes, literally, for almost 18 months. The ratings 
average for FOX during the first full season was not 6, as promised to 
advertisers -- it was 3.6, a shortfall of more than 2 million viewers. 
According to Pat Mastandrea, senior vice president for national sales, FOX had 
to provide "make-goods" -- free advertising -- to compensate advertisers for 
the smaller audience. "We had between 30 and 35% make-goods in our first 
years," says Mastandrea. "We made good on every deal that we made, to the 
penny. It was very frustrating to give 35% of our inventory away." It took 
until the end of September, 1988, to meet that obligation. 
</P>
<P>
There were make-goods on the local level as well -- a contributing factor, 
according to Drexel Burnham Lambert media analyst Jeffrey Russell, in a 
$10-million drop in operating profits for the seven owned stations for fiscal 
1988. The affiliates, some of whom dropped "The Late Show" before it was 
canceled, realized that the benefits of their network link might take longer to 
materialize than they had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
"What an independent station has to do is evaluate whether they're better off 
running FOX programming, even if ratings are a bit lower, than they were 
running a movie," says Larry Gerbrandt, senior analyst of cable and 
broadcasting programming for Paul Kagan &amp; Associates, a Carmel, 
Calif.-based media consulting firm. "It varies market to market." As to whether 
FOX affiliates are better off, Gerbrandt says, "It's a qualified yes." 
</P>
<P>
The network also had to absorb what Wendle calls "abandonment costs," payments 
made to honor contracts on canceled series. Two of the Saturday night comedy 
casualties, "Karen's Song" and "Down and Out in Beverly Hills," were 
"multimillion-dollar mistakes." Wendle estimates that a single hour of failed 
programming cost the network $10 million in programming costs, including 
extended payments on contracts, and another $20 million in advertising 
make-goods. 
</P>
<P>
Although FOX executives are quick to deny that the extent of their financial 
troubles really surprised them, the impact of the losses was felt even by their 
relatively successful producers, who suddenly found themselves victims of 
second-guessing. Semel, who had happily anticipated that the first order for 13 
segments of "Duet" would be followed by orders of equal size, found himself 
instead having to defend the show as definitions shifted as to what FOX should 
be. 
</P>
<P>
"We hoped that each time we'd get similar orders -- for 13, or for 26," he 
says, "but each time it has been like pulling teeth. Each time we're up for 
renewal they've been in the midst of periodic uncertainties about what they 
want to do. Last year they weren't going to pick us up; they were at a point 
where they really wanted to go all the way in being an alternative program 
service, and the fact that 'Duet' could have appeared on one of the three 
networks worked against us. We were the most traditional. Luckily, they backed 
off from that position." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, "21 Jump Street" creator Patrick Hasburgh found that the 
uncertainty worked in his favor. For all the talk of alternative programming, 
the new network had been, in the beginning, more cautious than Hasburgh had 
anticipated. "They wanted to be a little more commercial. I think they wanted 
'Happy Days Goes to High School,' " he says, referring to a highly successful 
NBC situation comedy. "The pressure for the show to be successful was so 
enormous that I think we almost lost sight of what was good." 
</P>
<P>
Hasburgh nearly walked off the show in its first season when executives refused 
to approve a controversial episode about racial tensions -- but when "21 Jump 
Street" proved to be the company's first success, he was allowed to produce the 
segment. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Hasburgh has left Stephen Cannell Productions to form his own 
company. Although he is no longer involved in making "21 Jump Street," he does 
plan to produce TV-movies and series for FOX. Hasburgh dismisses the network's 
disappointing economic showing, and its attendant identity crises, as 
predictable problems for a young network. The only real mistake he thinks FOX 
made was to assume that high-priced talent would be insurance against failure, 
and to commit to putting shows on the air before there was enough "back-up 
inventory" to replace a ratings casualty. 
</P>
<P>
"The FOX executives made the same mistake George Steinbrenner made," says 
Hasburgh. "He said, 'I'll win the pennant if I buy the best baseball players 
available.' Which he did. And he finished third." 
</P>
<P>
Salvation, as it turned out, came from an unexpected direction -- from a 
concept for a show that FOX had originally rejected, a show that offered a 
distinct departure from network fare at a bargain price. "America's Most 
Wanted" was developed by FOX-owned station WTTG in Washington, and its 
impressive ratings made it more appealing to a network beset by conventional 
entertainment program failures. Perhaps this was the alternative FOX needed; at 
about $150,000 in production costs for a half-hour segment, as opposed to 
$300,000 for a sitcom, it certainly had financial appeal. The network gave 
"America's Most Wanted" a Sunday night slot last April, and in its second week 
the show achieved the highest rating ever achieved by a regularly scheduled FOX 
program. Over the summer, FOX introduced three more "reality programs": "A 
Current Affair," which had been running on WNYW in New York since June, 1986, 
"The Reporters" and "Beyond Tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Then FOX got lucky. The five-month Writers Guild strike caused a postponement 
of the fall season; the three networks had to program an extended line-up of 
reruns. That opened up the viewing audience to "sampling," says Mastandrea, and 
FOX picked up some of the shoppers. Although FOX was also airing reruns, most 
viewers had missed the programming the first time around, so the shows looked 
fresh. 
</P>
<P>
The new viewers were primarily in their teens and 20s, people whose viewing 
habits were not yet "frozen over," according to Diller. The demographics of the 
FOX audience skewed to the lower end of the 18- to 35-year-old range -- which 
meant that an advertiser with a youth-oriented product, like their biggest 
advertiser, Coca-Cola, could reach that isolated audience for less than it 
would cost to make a network buy. The FOX ad sales staff got such an 
enthusiastic response over the summer that they purposely oversold, selling 80% 
of their ad inventory up front instead of the 70% they had planned to offer. 
</P>
<P>
It was a calculated risk, according to Kellner, because FOX was selling time 
that the network would need for make-goods, if programs again failed to perform 
at the ratings estimate. "Thank God the ratings are going up," he says. 
"Otherwise we would have had to add shows, run a movie once a quarter, or 
something like that, to be able to make up the weight we needed." 
</P>
<P>
If some critics have complained about the quality of the alternative now being 
offered -- dubbing these shows "tabloid journalism" and viewing them as part of 
a trend toward sensationalistic programming -- members of the financial 
community look at the ratings, and the dramatic drop in costs, and pronounce 
the programming a success. 
</P>
<P>
"They've carved out an interesting alternative for the younger demographic 
audience," says Drexel Burnham Lambert's Russell. "You or I may not like it, 
but somebody out there likes it. And the advertising dollars ultimately follow 
the eyeballs." 
</P>
<P>
Murdoch shrugs off the criticism. "People who read newspapers," says the man 
who owns more than four dozen of them, "tend not to be the people who watch 
television." 
</P>
<P>
Failed programming was FOX's most visible problem, but the new network was 
wobbly internally as well. Hiring "young, relatively inexperienced people" 
worked better in theory than it did in practice. Diller's programming 
department simply wasn't as coordinated as it needed to be. And his executives 
couldn't exert the control needed -- they were either too busy scrambling to 
fill suddenly vacant programming slots or caught up in management musical 
chairs, which saw Kevin Wendle in five different jobs in his first eighteen 
months at FOX. 
</P>
<P>
The first defection was Garth Ancier, who resigned as president of Fox 
Entertainment, effective March 1 of this year. Diller says that Ancier told him 
six months ago he was tired of the job but agreed to stay on because "we were 
at our most vulnerable point and couldn't take any shock to our system," 
although one producer who has worked with the network says that Ancier had 
become a "lame-duck executive" once Wendle was put in charge of day-to-day 
programming. Whatever the impetus, his replacement, Peter Chernin, ex-Lorimar 
Film Entertainment president, appealed to Diller because he was "a real 
manager." 
</P>
<P>
"Peter is a mature, truly organized executive who, I think, will bring 
stability to the company," says Diller. "It is easy to say that that's a 
reflection on the past. But it's really evolutionary." 
</P>
<P>
The other significant addition to the FOX team is new Vice President of 
Development Joe Davola, an MTV alum whose allure, according to Diller, is that 
he comprehends "the essence of getting things going on nothing. His program 
budget high was maybe $6,000. He gives us a whole new group of people to talk 
to." He also embodies the clear purpose of FOX: to go after the youth market on 
a budgetary shoestring. 
</P>
<P>
FOX staffers still like to think of themselves as what Wendle calls "guerrilla 
programmers" -- quicker and more open to new ideas than their bureaucratically 
gridlocked brethren at the big three networks. But Diller admits that the pace 
has slowed since the early days, when "we were so behind that I don't think in 
a lot of respects we knew what we were doing." Cautiously, he borrows good 
ideas from the networks -- there are now more programs in development, and more 
steps in the process. A show no longer jumps from idea to on-air: Now, FOX 
might ask for a sample script, or even a pilot. 
</P>
<P>
"We shouldn't get bureaucratic," he says, "but there's no reason not to act 
professionally. We should pick from what the networks do, sensibly." 
</P>
<P>
The network also abandoned what Murdoch calls the "track record" school of 
programming. "We tended to go along with it because we were engaging what 
seemed to be the experts," he says of his, and Diller's, initial support of the 
idea. But his interest was in the "more experimental" programs such as "The 
Tracy Ullman Show" -- and when some of the most dependable companies in 
Hollywood couldn't serve up hits, Murdoch conveyed his dissatisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
"We always want to buy the best and brightest," Murdoch says. "That's not the 
same as buying the person with the track record, because that could be some old 
fogy. It very often is." 
</P>
<P>
Since FOX's most recent successes came from outside the Los Angeles production 
center, there is no way to predict how the new attitudes at FOX will affect the 
third night of programming, the first major effort from Diller's staff since 
the string of Saturday night failures. One previously announced project from 
Aaron Spelling Productions, an updated version of his successful series 
"Charlie's Angels," was in development for so long that its name was changed 
from "Angels '88" to "Angels '89." It is no longer planned as a series -- when 
and if it airs at all (and right now there is no production scheduled), it will 
be a series of two-hour movie specials. And "City Court," a spin-off from "21 
Jump Street" featuring young lawyers instead of young cops, has been on hold 
since its creator, Hasburgh, left the project. Diller says he intends to stick 
with "fiction programming" for the third night, despite the high-profile 
success he's had with reality shows. The one sure thing is that there will be 
more shows to choose from: FOX now has between 40 and 50 programs in various 
stages of development, an expensive but necessary insurance policy against 
disappointing debuts. 
</P>
<P>
The search for stable ground continues, but Rupert Murdoch is not worried. His 
$20-million loss estimate for fiscal 1989 is down from an original figure of 
$35 million, and that, he believes, constitutes progress. Not that his support 
was ever a doubt: He says he would have backed FOX even if losses had again 
exceeded the estimates, as they did in the first year. As long as the ratings 
improve, he is happy. "I would not mind losing money again and again if we were 
making solid progress," he says. "If we were still losing $50 million and our 
ratings were performing the way they are today, I would still be right in 
there. Absolutely. We are going forward very well." 
</P>
<P>
His attitude -- his personal definition of success and failure -- may be the 
key to the survival of FOX. Murdoch says he is prepared for several more years 
of losses, since any monies made will be invested back into program 
development. He says he expects it will take six or seven years before the 
network can offer a nightly prime-time schedule. 
</P>
<P>
As long as Murdoch is prepared to foot the bill, the experiment continues. 
Sheer financial stamina may buy the Fox Broadcasting Co. the time to find its 
niche in the video marketplace. Money, after all, talks. "I think an ability to 
write the check -- and a willingness to write the check -- gives the network a 
great credibility," Murdoch says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alternative Programming: Joys, Woes 
</P>
<P>
FOX's "alternative programming" 
</P>
<P>
 -- shows perhaps too controversial for the big networks but attractive to 
younger viewers -- has produced "Duet," upper left; "21 Jump Street," right, 
and "Married . . . With Children," whose star, Katey Sagal, is at left. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Married . . . With Children" has been both the most popular and most 
controversial of the FOX shows. For the last two weeks it has bested the three 
major networks in the Los Angeles ratings for the 8:30 p.m. Sunday slot. And 
its portrayals of family and sexual matters have led to a letter-writing 
campaign by a Michigan mother and to considerable media coverage of that 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FOX owner Rupert Murdoch, left, shrugs off both the criticism of his network's 
alternative programming and print critics' charges that FOX indulges in 
"tabloid journalism." "People who read newspapers," says the man who owns more 
than four dozen of them, "tend not to be the people who watch television."

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: WHAT THE NOMINATED DOCUMENTARIES HAVE TO OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the furor continues over "The Thin Blue Line's" lack of an Oscar 
nomination for best documentary film, what about the documentaries that were 
nominated? 
</P>
<P>
Unsurprisingly, all but one of them are political. ("Let's Get Lost," a 
portrait of musician Chet Baker, is the exception.) Perhaps political is too 
limited a word: They are films about justice and the unfaltering work of some 
very different men and women to see that it prevails. 
</P>
<P>
The nominees are: 
</P>
<P>
"The Cry of Reason -- Beyers Naude: An Afrikaner Speaks Out," produced by 
Robert Bilheimer and Ronald Mix. Classic in its form and formidable in its 
angry intelligence, this is a stirring portrait of ex-Dutch Reform churchman 
Naude, once looked on as a leading contender to be prime minister of South 
Africa, now a man some consider the logical successor to Anglican Bishop 
Desmond Tutu. 
</P>
<P>
Naude's doubts about the compatibility of apartheid and Christian principles 
began well before Sharpeville, but that massacre in 1960 crystallized his 
thinking and shifted his orderly, white Afrikaner's life 180 degrees. Modest, 
articulate and passionate in his zeal about the obscenity of apartheid, 
churchman Naude stands shoulder to shoulder with South Africa's people of 
color, one of their most vigorous spokesmen. 
</P>
<P>
As the film makes clear, Naude has endured government banning to emerge more 
thoughtful, more focused and more powerful than before. (Non-Academy members 
may be interested in knowing that this film, as well as "Promises to Keep," 
will show Saturday and Sunday mornings through March at the Monicas in Santa 
Monica.) 
</P>
<P>
"Hotel Terminus -- The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie" by Marcel Ophuls, plays 
like a gigantic mystery story, as the dogged film maker follows the trail of 
the Gestapo chief whose penchant for sadism won him the nickname "Butcher of 
Lyon." With meticulously detailed interviews of Barbie's few surviving victims, 
with resistance heroes and/or saints and civilian sinners, Ophuls creates a 
schizophrenic picture of France during the Occupation, as its deeply ingrained 
anti-Semitism clashed with individual acts of heroism. The wonder is that -- 
with one notable exception -- Ophuls is able to keep the pressure on but the 
touch ironic, not thundering. This is Mozart, not Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
Chilling for Americans are the interviews with ex-CIA or Army Intelligence 
cowboys, as it becomes clear that their anti-Communist zeal helped to keep 
Barbie a free man an unconscionable length of time. With a 4 1/2-hour running 
time, Ophuls has ample time for a multilayered portrait in this infinitely 
civilized and sophisticated work. The wonder is that so few untainted souls 
emerge by the time he is through. He has dedicated the film to one of them, a 
Frenchwoman who risked her life to try to save one of Barbie's child-victims. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's Get Lost," produced by Bruce Weber and Nan Bush, is as gorgeous-looking 
as Weber's camera work can make it, which is pretty gorgeous since Weber is the 
photographer behind the Calvin Klein ads, but it's vapid in the upper story. 
With the fullest cooperation of trumpeter/singer Chet Baker himself, Weber 
squints at the tragic arc of the great jazz musician's life and produces a 
myopic film in the vein of purest exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
Even Baker's music is made to suffer. More than once, during footage of an old 
recording session, the film makers cut him off before the end of a phrase, to 
meander off after one of his wives or ex-girl-friends, ragging on each other, 
or to persuade Baker to tell another of his tall tales of his drug excesses. 
</P>
<P>
With their constant comparisons between Baker's handsome 
Jack-O'Lantern-cheekbones at 24, and the skull-like burned-out remains left now 
that he's in his 50s, you feel the film makers are mourning the loss of another 
pretty face far more than they are the unraveling of a singular talent. Already 
stuffed with banal non-interviews, the film reaches its lowest point as Baker's 
customary supply of Methadone is interrupted in Europe for more than a week. In 
the face of Baker's obvious pain, a questioner asks him unctuously, "How do you 
feel, Chet?" Probably no worse than a Baker lover by the end of this film. 
</P>
<P>
"Promises to Keep" is a lively, angry film by Ginny Durrin. It centers around a 
volatile activist for the homeless in Washington, D.C., the mustachioed Mitch 
Snyder, whom one on-camera Washington bureaucrat tries to compare with the 
infamous Jim Jones. The comparison is apt only in that many of the 600-odd 
homeless in the downtown Washington shelter are black. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder is a diplomat of the Leo Durocher school of sweet-talking; that much the 
film makes clear. (He even seems to have put off Martin Sheen, who played him 
in a TV miniseries, although not enough to keep Sheen from narrating this 
film.) But a less abrasive man might have crumbled in the face of the federal 
government's years-long opposition to the shelter that Snyder captains, right 
in the shadow of the White House. Neither creative bureaucratic neglect nor 
President Reagan's outright reneging on his promise to fund the pilot shelter 
seems to faze Snyder, willing to risk his life in a 45-day fast for his cause. 
You may still not completely understand him by the film's end, but you have 
certainly watched him in every kind of physical and psychological weather. 
</P>
<P>
"Who Killed Vincent Chin?" is a question to which film makers Renee Tajima and 
Christine Choy knew the answer well before they began work. As one witness says 
bluntly, "An auto worker who was out of work beat up a Chinese guy he thought 
was Japanese." The fascination of the film is the skill with which every issue 
behind that act is laid bare; the tensions in East Detroit that prompted a 
43-year-old laid-off Chrysler foreman and his stepson to take a baseball bat to 
27-year-old Chin on the night of his bachelor party. 
</P>
<P>
No tenet, no person will emerge unscathed, certainly not the American judicial 
system. Not even the Detroit-born Chin himself, who, because his lifelong buddy 
was white, naively let himself believe that other fellow auto workers were 
equally casual and enlightened. Part of the horror of the film is getting to 
know Ron Ebens, the hefty, blond, slightly run-to-seed foreman, seeing how 
easily his rage disappears behind his "regular guy" affability. 
</P>
<P>
There are also a range of motives visible within the Chinese community, 
prompted to nationwide action after Ebens' appeal of his 25-year sentence sets 
him free. Finally, we may even question the film makers' use of Mrs. Chin's 
tragic inconsolableness as, over a four-year period, her freshets of tears are 
used again and again, at rallies and banquets, to set her community's outrage 
off anew. 
</P>
<P>
So this is the lot. And while we are brooding about omissions, let us not 
forget "Vincent," a soaring biographical portrait of Van Gogh by Paul Cox, 
which challenges the boundaries of the form no less than "The Thin Blue Line," 
and perhaps to greater emotional effect. And there was the coolly dispensed wit 
and vitriol in Dennis O'Rourke's brilliant, hilarious "Cannibal Tours." Either 
of these could make a berth on any "A" team worthy of the name.

'THE THIN BLUE LINE': JUSTICE FOR ALL?; 
</P>
<P>
AN INSIDE LOOK AT WHY A DOCUMENTARY THAT HAD REAL-LIFE IMPACT DIDN'T MAKE THE 
CUT IN THE OSCAR RACE 
</P>

The New York Film Critics Circle named it the best feature documentary of 1988. 
The National Board of Review gave it the D. W. Griffith Award for the same 
reason. In four different newspaper polls of the nation's critics, it placed 
first as the best film of the year, feature or documentary. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, the Independent Documentary Assn., an organization composed of 
people involved in the medium, gave it one of its five fraternal "IDA" awards 
for distinguished achievement. And last week, due to evidence collected in the 
making of the movie, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals overturned a verdict 
that had put the subject of the film on Death Row 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
If there was ever a film with a lock on an Academy Award, Erroll Morris' "The 
Thin Blue Line" appeared to be it. It had a profound topic, overwhelming 
critical acclaim and the kind of respectful media coverage that benefits the 
entire industry. Morris himself was the subject of a 15,000-word profile in New 
Yorker magazine, and there were those in Hollywood who thought he might become 
the first person to receive a best director nomination for a documentary. 
</P>
<P>
But when the Oscar nominations were announced last month, the names of Morris 
and "The Thin Blue Line" were nowhere to be found, a fact that shocked critics 
and finlm makers alike. 
</P>
<P>
"It is one of the most outrageous things in the modern history of the academy," 
said English director Michael Apted, who has made both features ("Coal Miner's 
Daughter," "Gorillas in the Mist") and documentaries ("28 Up"). "For my money, 
it was the best piece of film in any category. That they ignored it diminishes 
the academy." 
</P>
<P>
Film critic Roger Ebert, who lists Morris' 1979 "Gates of Heaven" as one of the 
10 best films ever made, called the slighting of "The Thin Blue Line" "the 
worst non-nomination" of the year and attributed its rejection to the inability 
of academy voters to appreciate innovative film making. 
</P>
<P>
"If (Morris) had done a '60 Minutes' documentary with talking heads, film clips 
and conventional narration, they would have nominated it," Ebert said. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps they would have. In interviews with several of the 40 members of the 
academy's documentary committee, the film's style -- its blend of interviews, 
reenactments and fetishist-like close-ups of police lights, pistols and other 
murder scene objects -- was often mentioned as being off-putting. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is a case of the emperor has no clothes," said one documentary 
film maker on the committee. "I was shocked that the film had gotten all that 
attention, and my own evaluation was so different. The critical accolades were 
stunningly different from what I observed." 
</P>
<P>
From interviews done for this story, it doesn't appear that "The Thin Blue 
Line" even came close to receiving a nomination. All but one of the members 
interviewed said they did not consider it one of the five best films they saw. 
In fact, at the committee screening of "The Thin Blue Line," enough members 
raised their hands to have the film stopped before it was completed. 
</P>
<P>
It is a common democratic procedure, committee members explained, to have a 
film turned off when enough of them request it. It is a process that one member 
described as "dumping," something that occurs frequently when there's a heavy 
workload. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Nadel, chairman of the academy's documentary committee, said 74 films 
were submitted this year, adding up to between 100 and 150 hours of viewing, if 
each one was played to the end. 
</P>
<P>
How much of "The Thin Blue Line" did the committee see before they dumped it? 
</P>
<P>
"It was 85% of the way through," one member in attendance that night said. 
"Some of us stayed and they showed the rest of it. But it's unfair to say the 
others might have voted differently if they'd watched it all. The film was not 
liked." 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Workman, whose "Precious Images" won him an Oscar in 1986 (in the short 
films-live action category), said he considered "The Thin Blue Line" one of the 
best films of the year and that he was surprised it did not get nominated. But 
Workman said he did not think there was anything political in the rejection. 
</P>
<P>
"There is very little politics involved in that group," he said. "They have 
minds of their own and vote the way they see it. A lot of people just didn't 
like the movie." 
</P>
<P>
Nominations for documentaries, both shorts and features, involve preliminary 
and final voting. After each screening, members evaluate the film on a scale of 
4 to 10 and jot their ratings down in booklets that remain with the academy. 
After they've seen all of the submitted films, they get together for a day to 
discuss what they've seen ("We argue and lobby each other," one member said), 
then they vote again. Only the final votes, which are turned over immediately 
to Price-Waterhouse, count. (Voting for the actual Oscar is done by all academy 
members, who validate their attendance at screenings of all five nominees.) 
</P>
<P>
At this year's wrap-up nominations meeting, "The Thin Blue Line" was hardly 
discussed, members say. 
</P>
<P>
"It was discussed only in the sense that there was so much negative feeling 
about it," Workman said. "It was pretty much dismissed." 
</P>
<P>
So, how does a film steamroll critics, woo audiences ("The Thin Blue Line" 
grossed $1.5 million, which is considered good for a documentary) and get a 
warm reception on newspaper op-ed pages, only to feel an Arctic breeze emerge 
from the academy? 
</P>
<P>
Theories abound: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The film had too much publicity. It was overhyped by the distributors and 
set itself up for a fall. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Miramax Films, which holds the worldwide theatrical and videocassette 
rights to it, pushed too hard in its Academy Award campaign. In suggesting it 
in trade ads for consideration as both best picture and best documentary 
feature, it sent a signal to the committee members that the film was worthy of 
more than they could give it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The film was too slick, it had too much production for its own good. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The academy voters are too old and too narrow in their views of 
documentaries to accept Morris' innovative style, and many of them do not have 
the expertise to judge. 
</P>
<P>
The committee members who did not vote for "The Thin Blue Line" dismiss all of 
these notions. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (the distributors) set the film up as a shoo-in and that it created an 
expectation among members that the film couldn't meet," said Mitchell Block, 
whose Direct Cinema distributes documentaries. "But there was no backlash. As a 
group, we simply thought the five nominated films were better." 
</P>
<P>
As for the critics, Block said they have no cause for outrage: "How can they 
say 'Thin Blue Line' is the best documentary of the year when they haven't even 
seen the five that were nominated? They can say 'Rain Man' is the best movie if 
they've seen all the features, but they can't say they know better than we do 
if they haven't seen what we've seen." 
</P>
<P>
Ebert concedes that point to Block, but won't concede to those members who said 
film critics get caught up in the emotion of a movie and overlook its 
structural flaws. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a strong impulse in America to want a movie to tell a story, with 
none of the stylistic elements . . . to distract you," Ebert said. "We now have 
all these movies that are totally narrative. People are resistant to movies 
like 'The Thin Blue Line' that break that narrative reverie. I think that's 
what happened (in that committee)." 
</P>
<P>
The makeup of the documentary committee is cited by some as its strength and by 
others as its weakness. 
</P>
<P>
"We have producers, directors, camera people, actors, film editors -- all kinds 
of extraordinary talents who have the dedication to commit to seeing all these 
films," said chairman Nadel. "They bring a lot of knowledge to the (nominations 
process)." 
</P>
<P>
Workman said he believes the committee would be more effective if its makeup 
were less heterogenous. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the intentions of everyone on the committee are very good," he said. 
"Their tastes are their own, and not necessarily enlightened. I just wish there 
were more film makers involved." 
</P>
<P>
The committee is composed of academy members who volunteer for the job and are 
then selected by the chairman. Nadel, who took over from Norman Corwin last 
year, will not discuss committee membership, but other members estimated that 
more than half are older than 65 and that there are only four who are under 50. 
</P>
<P>
One other theory raised to explain the fate of "The Thin Blue Line" is that it 
was a victim of timing. Because it was one of the last of the 74 films shown to 
the committee, maybe the members were too weary to give it the attention it 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
The last 10 minutes of the movie includes what amounts to a confession by the 
real killer. Yet, enough members at the committee screening apparently were 
ready to stop the film before there was a hint of the third-act revelation. 
</P>
<P>
Nadel would not comment on how or why films are stopped, but two members 
emphasized that the decision to dump is "democratic," implying that if one more 
than 50% of the viewers raise their hands, the projector is turned off. In any 
event, when the hands went up at the screening of "The Thin Blue Line," there 
was apparently no opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Morris, who is in Los Angeles attempting to parlay the success of "The Thin 
Blue Line" into a feature film assignment, refused to be drawn into the Oscar 
debate, saying he had received his award when the Texas appeals court 
overturned the conviction of Randall Adams. 
</P>
<P>
"My main concern from the beginning has been to get Randall Adams out of 
prison," Morris said. "What this film has done for me has been enormous. The 
fact that I've been involved in a case like this and have had an impact on it 
has been reward enough." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Morris acknowledged that it would have been nice to stand before 
the world and thank the people who made it possible -- "Sue Weil at PBS, who 
believed in me and the project and found a way to keep us going when no one 
else was willing; Lindsay Law at American Playhouse, who got involved and made 
it possible for me to do the re-enactments, to hire (composer) Philip Glass and 
turn the interview material into a movie. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Morris, who has worked as a private investigator between documentaries, said he 
and Randall Adams are "ahead of the game," that he's got a new lease on his 
film career and Adams a new lease on life. But that's not enough for those 
people who think their victory should have been toasted with an Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
"His film is as good a look at that part of America as I have ever seen," said 
director Michael Apted, pointing out that the academy bestowed a batch of 
nominations (seven) on "Mississippi Burning" while ignoring a documentary that 
puts the spotlight on a more recent example of Southern injustice. "It's 
shameful that fellow members in the industry don't give it the acknowledgement 
it deserves." 
</P>
<P>
The final upshot of "The Thin Blue Line" -- the overturned conviction -- came 
after the Oscar nominations were announced. Workman wonders how his colleagues 
on the committee felt as they read the front-page news stories about that 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"I think those people are embarrassed now," Workman said. "Wouldn't it be nice 
if every time you see (the Randall Adams case) mentioned, it says, 'The Academy 
Award-nominated film'?" 
</P>
<P>
But another member seemed to be speaking for the majority when he said, "I'm 
thrilled that an innocent man is going to get out of jail. But that doesn't 
mean a badly made picture should get an Oscar . . . or even a nomination."

CHARISMATIC CANNIBAL TAKES HIS TIME; 
</P>
<P>
BRITISH BAND'S FAST-RISING NEW ALBUM ENDS 3-YEAR LAYOFF, BREAKUP RUMORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Momentum can be crucial in pop music, where out of sight has often proved to be 
out of mind. So industry observers saw danger signals all around when the Fine 
Young Cannibals didn't follow their highly regarded 1985 debut album with a new 
collection in 1986 . . . or 1987 . . . or 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The first suspicion: Roland Gift, the English rock trio's charismatic lead 
singer, was going solo. 
</P>
<P>
On the first Cannibals LP, Gift demonstrated the talent as a singer and 
lyricist to make the prospect reasonable. Not only did he turn in an exquisite 
vocal on a remake of Elvis Presley's "Suspicious Minds," but he also won praise 
for his affecting tales of troubled social conditions. The headline in more 
than one British pop weekly: "God's Gift to Rock." 
</P>
<P>
Second line of speculation: The other Cannibals -- guitarist Andy Cox and 
bassist David Steele -- were breaking away themselves, miffed by Gift's 
spending two months making his acting debut in director Stephen Frears' film 
"Sammy and Rosie Get Laid." 
</P>
<P>
While Gift was off making the film, Steele and Cox indeed recorded a single 
under the pseudonym Two Men, a Drum Machine &amp; a Trumpet. The record, "Tired 
of Getting Pushed Around," became an international dance-club hit, and some 
observers saw the song's title as a not-so-subtle message to Gift. The pair 
also produced the debut album by the British group Wee Papa Girl Rappers. 
</P>
<P>
But there was no split. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever tensions may have existed privately, the Cannibals are back with a new 
album, "The Raw &amp; the Cooked." It's a sensational blend of rock and soul 
elements: a dance-floor treat that doesn't sacrifice vocal and lyric 
sensitivity. (See Review on Page 84). 
</P>
<P>
"She Drives Me Crazy," a single from the LP, is already in the national Top 40, 
and I.R.S. Records is optimistic that the album will be one of the year's 
biggest hits. "Our initial sales projection was 2 million units for the album," 
said Jay Boberg, president of I.R.S. "But the album is moving so well that 
we're already looking beyond that." 
</P>
<P>
Al Teller, president of MCA Records, which distributes I.R.S., also predicted 
"The Raw &amp; the Cooked" would go multi-platinum. 
</P>
<P>
Though the former president of CBS Records took over at MCA only in September, 
Teller was familiar with the Cannibals' 1985 collection. "In fact," he said. 
"Among the questions I had for MCA was, 'Whatever happened to the Fine Young 
Cannibals?' 
</P>
<P>
"What makes the album so gratifying is that it represents a major breakthrough 
in terms of further crumbling the artificial boundaries in radio -- the 
boundaries between what is rock, dance, urban, pop. . . . You go from cut to 
cut on the album and you'll find strains of everything . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
So why the three years-plus wait between albums? 
</P>
<P>
Roland Gift, 27, rolls his eyes and smiles when he hears the question. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone kept talking about how we had split up," he said. "It was the only 
reasoning they could come up with to explain why we wouldn't rush back into the 
studio and put out another album. But the thing is, if you haven't got the 
songs, you can't make a good album and we knew we didn't have the songs. 
</P>
<P>
"The danger is letting acclaim or popularity lull you into thinking you can do 
anything, that you are supermen, that the record will somehow be good even 
without great songs. But we never fell into that. We had enough sense to take 
our time." 
</P>
<P>
The Cannibals may not have released an album since 1985, but the group hasn't 
been totally silent the last three years. They toured the U.S. in late 1986, 
and several songs from the first album -- notably "Suspicious Minds" and "Blue" 
-- were widely played on college and alternative rock radio stations well into 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Among those impressed: film director Barry Levinson, who asked the band to 
write some songs for his film "Tin Men." The result was four Cannibals songs 
and a cameo appearance by the band in the film. 
</P>
<P>
I.R.S.'s Boberg said the film helped keep the Cannibals' presence alive in the 
pop world. 
</P>
<P>
"When the movie came out, we got hundreds of inquiries from fans and retailers, 
asking when the sound-track album was going to come out. The same thing 
happened when the film went on cable. But there wasn't enough music for an 
album, so people had to either buy the first album or wait for the new one." 
</P>
<P>
Boberg said more interest in the Cannibals was built when the trio's version of 
an old Buzzcocks song, "Ever Fallen in Love," was included in the score to 
Jonathan Demme's film "Something Wild," starring Melanie Griffith. The film 
exposure helped push sales of the debut album -- which had stopped at around 
200,000 after the initial air play and tour -- past the 350,000 mark. 
</P>
<P>
Gift was soft-spoken but self-assured as he sat in a Hollywood hotel recently 
and talked about the Cannibals. One of five children, he was raised by his 
mother, a shopkeeper in Hull, a once-thriving fishing port in northeast 
England. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently disinterested in school, he found comfort in the punk movement of 
the late '70s -- reportedly dying his hair red, gold and green (the colors of 
the Ethiopian flag), wearing bondage trousers, and attaching the severed arm of 
a doll to a jacket sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
Caught up in the anybody-can-start-a-band spirit of the punk era, Gift joined a 
group that got its name from the room where it practiced: Blue Kitchen. "We 
didn't have a lot of equipment so we used pots and pans as drums when we 
practiced, then sort of borrowed people's drums when we did a gig," he 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Gift was a saxophonist in the band because singers in the early days of punk 
just shouted, and that didn't interest him. 
</P>
<P>
"The funny thing is that singing was what made me first want to be in music," 
he said. "I remember listening to an Otis Redding album . . . 'Otis Blue' . . . 
when I was around 10. It was mainly the singing, not so much the songs. . . . 
The voice just seemed like such magic. 
</P>
<P>
"But the punk thing wasn't really into singing . . . at least not the way I 
thought of it. That's why I picked up on the saxophone. It wasn't until bands 
like the Clash started opening people up to other styles of music . . . reggae 
and black music . . . that having a good voice came back in style." 
</P>
<P>
Gift was still primarily a saxophonist when he met Steele and Cox, who were 
still in the English Beat, one of the most prominent ska-related rock bands to 
surface in England in the late '70s. Though Gift only did about three vocals 
when his band, the Akrylyx, opened for the Beat in the early '80s in Hull, Cox 
and Steele remembered him in 1984 when they were putting together a new band. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like they couldn't get me out of their mind or anything," Gift said 
good-naturedly. "They simply couldn't find anyone else. They had done this ad 
on MTV saying they were looking for a singer and they got 400 tapes, but they 
didn't like any of them. That's when they decided to take a chance on me." 
</P>
<P>
The Fine Young Cannibals' first album was one of the most striking debuts of 
the '80s. The most immediately appealing ele-ment was the singing. Besides the 
smokey richness of Gift's voice, there was a tension in his phrasing as he 
teasingly held certain words and chopped off others, making every syllable seem 
a new adventure. 
</P>
<P>
The socially-conscious themes stamped the Cannibals as a political band, but 
Gift said that slant was never a conscious part of his game plan. In the new 
album, he writes about the ups and downs of romance, but also about life in a 
dead-end town and the loss of innocence. Whatever the setbacks his characters 
encounter, there is always a sense of resilience. 
</P>
<P>
"Fighting back is something I believe in," Gift said. "That's why I think of 
our songs as modern-day blues. It helps to sing about things that trouble you. 
It's also a sign of getting older. You learn to deal with life better. When you 
are 15 or 16, everything is so life and death. If somebody stops going out with 
you, you almost feel like slitting your wrists. Everything is today because you 
think you are going to die by 30 anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Given the Cannibals' determination to wait until they had enough strong songs 
for the album, it's not surprising that the group is also taking its time about 
making tour plans. They want to see how the album does before deciding what 
size halls to play. 
</P>
<P>
Gift, meanwhile, has completed work on a second film, "Scandal." Just released 
in England, it is the story of the Christine Keeler/John Profumo government sex 
scandal in England in the early '60s. Gift plays one of Keeler's boyfriends. 
</P>
<P>
About his and the band's good fortunes, the singer-actor said, "We've all seen 
so many bands come and go -- virtually explode before your eyes. We never 
wanted to get into that race. We had confidence in our abilities. The record 
company was very understanding. 
</P>
<P>
"They could have held back some of our money in hopes of getting us back into 
the studio faster, but I think they see longevity in us as well. They had 
enough faith to say, 'Let us know when you are ready.' And one day we called 
and said, 'OK, it's time.' "

REPLAY: RHINO RELIVES THE BRITISH INVASION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
This feature spotlights noteworthy compilations and reissues. 
</P>
<P>
Albums: "The British Invasion: The History of British Rock -- Volumes I-IV." 
Rhino. 
</P>
<P>
Artists: Kinks, Zombies, Yardbirds, Hollies, Donovan, Cilla Black, Manfred 
Mann, others. 
</P>
<P>
History: "I like it, I like it!" exulted Gerry Marsden of Gerry &amp; the 
Pacemakers a quarter of a century ago, sounding a joyful tone over a bouncy 
"Mersey beat." That phrase spoke volumes: Marsden might have been singing not 
only of his girlfriend's charms, but of his delight -- and that of the many 
other British rockers then following the Beatles onto the American charts -- at 
transcending England's stark class differences through instant stardom. It was 
a chorus joined in by millions of American teens, who were open to a sprightly 
and slightly raucous pick-me-up in the wake of JFK's assassination. Many of 
these British invaders sold us back a filtered-down version of American rock 
and R&amp;B, but as the late critic Lester Bangs once noted, "This was not 
quite a replay of Pat Boone rendering Little Richard palatable to a white 
audience. In even the limpest, wimpiest Liverpudlian retread of an American 
R&amp;B oldie, there was at least the promise, the yearning, that both 
performers and audience might get loose, shake 'em on down, and run wild in the 
streets, as we of course eventually did." 
</P>
<P>
Sound: Anyone who listens to oldies stations like KRTH will recognize most of 
the 28 tracks from 1964-66 on these four indispensable albums. Prominently 
absent are the Beatles, Stones, the Who, Animals and Herman's Hermits, due to 
rights difficulties. But most of the other significant figures of that era are 
well represented, from the enduring riff-rock and social commentary of the 
Kinks (one of the few artists in the genre to have any lasting impact in music) 
to the wholly innocuous ballads of Chad &amp; Jeremy. Lennon and McCartney are 
represented in the half-dozen compositions -- recorded by Billy J. Kramer and 
Peter &amp; Gordon -- included here. Amid all the delightful pop fluff ("Lady 
Godiva," "Do Wah Diddy Diddy"), many significant beginnings can be sensed here 
-- of rock as a wild sexual release ("I'm a Man," "Wild Thing"), as a social 
protest force ("Shapes of Things," "Universal Soldier"), as a more literate 
story/song form ("Bus Stop"). Every pop fan should have all four of these 
volumes in the home library. CHRIS WILLMAN

PENNY STOCKS -- BIG-DOLLAR HUSTLE; 
</P>
<P>
SKILLFUL AND SLIPPERY SWINDLERS ARE BILKING UNWARY INVESTORS IN WHAT CONCERNED 
INVESTIGATORS ARE CALLING THE FRAUD OF 1989. 
</P>

<P>
Flimflam men and their schemes have long been as plentiful as palm trees in 
Southern California. Since the trains began rolling in a century ago, con 
artists and high rollers of all sizes and stripes have been lured by the 
promise of easy riches and a sunny clime. 
</P>
<P>
Now another swindle has been transplanted here in a big way: penny stock fraud. 
</P>
<P>
"Up until last year, we considered penny stocks to be a Denver and Salt Lake 
City problem," said G. William McDonald, chief of securities enforcement for 
the state. "In the last six months, it has really exploded here. It's the fraud 
of '89." 
</P>
<P>
Top federal prosecutors and securities regulators in Los Angeles echo 
McDonald's concern. They worry that penny stock abuse is a growth industry in a 
region already plagued by the nation's largest concentration of the 
high-pressure sales offices known as boiler rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the telephone tactics perfected by fast-talking salesmen who have been 
peddling bogus investments in precious metals and the like out of Southern 
California boiler rooms for years have proven very adaptable to penny stock 
manipulations. 
</P>
<P>
Penny stocks involved in frauds are usually issued by "shell" companies with no 
real operations. Sales agents claim the companies have great potential, such as 
a cure for AIDS or a means of making gold out of Costa Rican sand. 
</P>
<P>
The stocks themselves are thinly traded outside the market system, which makes 
them subject to manipulation by a single brokerage. They are almost always sold 
over the telephone, most often to unsophisticated buyers who are vulnerable to 
smooth-talking salesmen. 
</P>
<P>
"We've seen telemarketing techniques being used in connection with (stock) 
market manipulation cases," said Terree L. Bowers, chief of the major fraud 
section of the U.S. attorney's office, which is investigating several penny 
stock cases. 
</P>
<P>
Irving M. Einhorn, regional administrator for the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission, acknowledged that the swindlers "are faster than we are" and that 
the SEC does not have enough people to contain the rising abuses. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, 45 enforcement officials from the federal government, 
California, Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii and the National Assn. of Securities 
Dealers, which registers and polices stockbrokers, held an unpublicized meeting 
here to plot a joint attack. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the resources to deal with the multitude of people out there 
doing it," said Einhorn. "We need a coordinated response. We need criminal 
cases to send a message." 
</P>
<P>
Penny stock fraud has been around for a long time, even in California. A 
current federal investigation with roots in Southern California and plenty of 
sensational elements is threatening to blow the lid off penny stock abuses 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
The traditional twin centers of penny stock scams always have been Salt Lake 
City and Denver, where lax state laws allow promoters to operate with relative 
impunity. But in recent months, the schemes emerged as a national epidemic that 
has bilked small investors everywhere out of hundreds of millions of dollars -- 
often $500 or $1,000 at a time. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons behind the epidemic are hard to figure. 
</P>
<P>
Small investors have stayed away from Wall Street in droves since getting 
burned in the crash of October, 1987. Yet they show a logic-defying appetite 
for far riskier investments in penny stocks. 
</P>
<P>
The name itself is a misnomer. The stocks sell frequently for more than 
pennies, even in initial offerings. Prices can get pumped up to several dollars 
a share and, while most investors lose only a few thousand dollars, some are 
bilked out of far more. 
</P>
<P>
Penny stocks do, however, have some common characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
They are issued in huge numbers. An initial offering of 50 million shares is 
not unusual. 
</P>
<P>
Since they are traded in the over-the-counter market and not listed or quoted 
on any exchange, finding the current price of a stock is nearly impossible. 
This allows a brokerage total control of a stock's selling price. 
</P>
<P>
The brokerages earn their profits by charging investors a markup over the price 
the firm pays for the stock, a difference called the spread. The temptation to 
cheat buyers is enormous in penny stocks because buyers have limited means to 
check spreads. 
</P>
<P>
Even legitimate penny stocks are issued by companies about which little or no 
financial information is available. This is a loophole in the SEC regulations 
created in the late 1970s to make it easier for small companies to raise 
venture capital from the public. 
</P>
<P>
But most penny stocks today involve shell companies with no business or limited 
operations that are hyped by brokers and such gimmicks as false news releases. 
Dishonest promoters have overshadowed the legitimate uses of penny stocks and 
tainted the entire market. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, promoters use so-called "blank check offerings" in which the 
shell company claims to be issuing stock and raising money with the idea of 
looking for an unspecified business to buy. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 60% of the 166 stock issues for under $7.5 million registered with 
the SEC regional office in Los Angeles were blank checks, according to 
Frederick B. Goss of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
Penny stocks are sold by telephone, usually through unsolicited calls. 
Salespeople make up to 300 calls a day, promising quick profits with little or 
no risk. They offer "inside" information or push an opportunity that they claim 
is available only for a short time to select clients. 
</P>
<P>
But when a buyer tries to cash in on a paper profit, they find penny stocks 
virtually impossible to sell. The once engaging brokers are evasive at best, 
gone at worst. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tough Nut to Crack 
</P>
<P>
The hucksters are no longer relegated to Salt Lake City and Denver. They have 
grown more sophisticated and more mobile, expanding to places such as a section 
of Boca Raton, Fla., known as the Maggot Mile, New York, Las Vegas, and to the 
boiler room paradise of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Cracking down has proved difficult. 
</P>
<P>
In the same way that his predecessor, John S. R. Shad, put the heat on insider 
trading a few years ago, SEC Chairman David S. Ruder said last fall that 
curbing penny stock abuses would top the agency's enforcement agenda. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC took 27 enforcement actions against penny stock operators in 1988, and 
many more investigations are pending. The scams also are a main target of the 
new Justice Department task forces on securities fraud being formed in six 
cities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
But paying lawyers to fight the regulators is just another cost of doing 
business for the scammers. One expert has compared the enforcement effort to 
hitting mercury with a hammer -- for every one that's smashed, a hundred new 
ones pop up. 
</P>
<P>
There has been progress, however, in an investigation that law enforcement 
officials believe could make penny stock fraud a front-page story the same way 
the Dennis B. Levine and Ivan F. Boesky cases publicized insider trading and 
created some of the deterrence sought by prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
No criminal charges have been filed in the investigation, which is being 
conducted by a federal grand jury in Las Vegas with assistance from SEC 
investigators from Los Angeles and Chicago and the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
But hundreds of pages of court records and interviews show that investigators 
believe they are on the trail of a loose confederation of penny stock fraud 
artists that stretches from Denver and Salt Lake City to Palm Springs and the 
French Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a zinger of a case that lacks nothing," said H. Thomas Fehn, a Century 
City securities lawyer who represents a participant granted immunity by the 
government in the investigation. "There is no element of penny stock market 
manipulation that is not present in this case." 
</P>
<P>
According to papers filed by the government in federal courts in Santa Ana and 
Denver, one target of the federal investigation is Meyer Blinder, a 
multimillionaire who controls Blinder, Robinson &amp; Co., the nation's biggest 
penny stock brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Government Found Good Source 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "Blind 'em and rob 'em" by Forbes magazine, the brokerage operates 1,700 
offices nationwide and has its headquarters in a nine-story building in the 
Denver suburb of Englewood. 
</P>
<P>
Blinder has had run-ins with regulators for years. One of his attorneys, Alan 
C. Jacobson, said Blinder would not discuss the allegations in the court 
papers. Jacobson refused to comment beyond a blanket denial of wrongdoing by 
Blinder. 
</P>
<P>
In much the way that Dennis B. Levine's cooperation with prosecutors broke open 
the Wall Street insider trading scandal, the penny stock investigators got a 
big break last summer when a shrewd veteran of the penny stock game decided to 
spill his secrets. 
</P>
<P>
The government's good fortune started in July. French police raided a 
$6-million villa overlooking Cannes in southern France and arrested its owner, 
Thomas F. Quinn, a disbarred American lawyer with a record of violating 
securities laws. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn, who is being held without bond in a Paris jail, is suspected by Interpol 
and others of orchestrating an American-style penny stock fraud in Europe that 
bilked investors around the world of $500 million. The alleged scheme involved 
selling grossly overpriced stocks to investors over the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
Visiting Quinn that day was Arnold L. Kimmes, a longtime associate who 
allegedly ran Quinn's European boiler rooms as well as Kimmes' own penny stock 
scams out of Palm Springs, according to investigators and associates of Kimmes. 
</P>
<P>
Kimmes had the good luck to be away from the villa when the police arrived. He 
used a yacht to escape and then flew to the United States, said one lawyer 
involved in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Several months earlier, Kimmes had been awaiting surgery for lung cancer at 
Little Company of Mary Hospital in Torrance. Two hours before the operation, he 
was served with a subpoena from the SEC in a stock-fraud investigation. When 
questioned by the SEC in response to the subpoena, Kimmes took the Fifth 
Amendment and refused to testify. He also began spending more time in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
But when he returned to this country last summer, Kimmes was singing a 
different tune. Quinn and about 20 others across Europe were arrested and 
Kimmes faced the possibility of spending time in a French jail, which would not 
be as comfortable as its American counterpart for someone approaching his 67th 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
So Kimmes telephoned an attorney friend, who told him to hire a lawyer and 
consider cooperating with the Las Vegas investigation. It offered, among other 
things, a way to avoid extradition to France. 
</P>
<P>
Kimmes took the advice. According to an affidavit by IRS agent Robert H. 
Salisbury filed in connection with a four-day search of Blinder's headquarters 
in November, Kimmes has been providing valuable evidence for the ongoing 
investigation of Blinder and others. 
</P>
<P>
In the affidavit, Salisbury said Kimmes and a partner, Michael D. Wright of 
Salt Lake City, operated an elaborate penny stock scheme from 1985 until 1988 
that involved Blinder. 
</P>
<P>
Wright allegedly set up the shell companies and found the nominees to serve as 
officers and buy the initial stock with money he provided. Wright's lawyer in 
Las Vegas, Donald Campbell, would not comment. 
</P>
<P>
Kimmes' job was finding cooperative brokerages to handle the initial trades 
that made the companies appear to be public. He was renting a large house in 
Palm Springs much of that time, and his wife lived in another house in Palos 
Verdes Estates. 
</P>
<P>
One brokerage used by Kimmes, according to the affidavit, was Chelsea 
Securities in Newport Beach. Chelsea shut down shortly after being raided by 
the IRS last September as part of the investigation. Robert Killen, a former 
owner of Chelsea, denied any wrongdoing and said the office was closed because 
it was not profitable. 
</P>
<P>
According to court papers, the use of the nominees enabled Wright and Kimmes to 
control the shell companies and deliver 100% of the stock in 15 of them to 
Blinder. The stock then was pumped into Blinder's network of penny stock 
salesmen who peddled it to investors nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, Wright and Kimmes collected several million dollars and 
transferred much of it to Switzerland, where it was laundered through an 
elaborate scheme, the government claims. 
</P>
<P>
Despite being sued by regulators for years, Blinder has remained in business 
and won several important courtroom victories against the government. Along the 
way, he has grown wealthy and is contributing $2.1 million for a medical 
research center at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
His lawyers accuse the government of conspiring to shut him down in the current 
probe. In an interview with Forbes in January, Blinder called Kimmes a liar and 
said he had only met him for 15 minutes on one occasion. 
</P>
<P>
But federal agents who raided Blinder's headquarters last Nov. 19 found 
evidence that they said linked his brokerage to 10 shell companies created by 
Kimmes and Wright, according to court papers. 
</P>
<P>
Also seized by the agents from Blinder's penthouse office were two items that 
seem to symbolize the rapidly expanding penny stock business -- a craps table 
and a slot machine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1. A penny stock promoter forms a shell corporation, using friends or 
acquaintances as the officers. He registers the company with the SEC so its 
stock can be sold to the public. The SEC is little more than a rubber stamp, 
doing nothing more than making sure the paperwork is OK. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2. The promoter arranges for the initial stock to be sold to another tier of 
nominees. He even provides the nominees with the cash they use to buy the 
stocks. The promoter retains control over the stock and pays the nominees a 
small fee for using their name to create the illusion of a public offering. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3. Now the promoter controls all the stock in a public company and it can be 
peddled to naive investors. In cases known as "box stox," the swindler will 
sell the whole large package at a huge premium to a single, large penny stock 
brokerage with the power to market around the country. A brokerage may pay the 
equivalent of 1/2-cent a share for the stock. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
4. The brokerage earns its money by selling the stock to investors at a price 
higher than what it paid the promoter. The 1/2-cent a share may be sold to 
investors at 2 or 3 cents. Multiply by several million shares and the money 
gets big. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5. Salespeople working in "boiler rooms" at the brokerages earn $10,000 a month 
and up in commissions by selling stock usually through unsolicited "cold 
calls." They often use a carefully scripted three-call method: A prospecting 
call to say there might be something to sell, a second call to say a terrific 
investment is coming up, and the closing call to get the sucker to buy the 
stock and send in the payment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
6. The sales techniques are used over and over to push the stock price higher 
by foisting the stock on new investors. Early investors are told the value is 
soaring. People who want to sell out are persuaded to re-invest in a newer, 
hotter issue. No one is ever allowed to sell for cash and eventually the stock 
collapses and the investors lose their money.

RITZ-CARLTON SPAWNS UPSCALE HOTEL BOOM IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SCHINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not too long ago, vacationing in Orange County meant packing the kids into the 
station wagon for a trip to Disneyland, the beach and maybe a couple of nights 
in a local motel. 
</P>
<P>
Plenty of young families still make that legendary pilgrimage. But others with 
a taste for the high life -- and the cash to indulge it -- are discovering that 
Orange County tourism has gone upscale. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, when the Ritz-Carlton hotel opened on a stretch of oceanfront property 
that is now part of Dana Point, some hotel experts predicted that the luxurious 
391-room hotel would never make money. For one thing, it seemed out of 
character with Southern California. (At first, the hotel required men to wear 
jackets after sunset; it still requires jackets and ties in the dining room.) 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Ritz-Carlton says it is operating at a profit, and, by all accounts, 
it is a success. It has since been joined by the 350-room Dana Point Resort, 
which is more modest than the Ritz but nevertheless an upscale establishment on 
a bluff overlooking Dana Point Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Now other developers, eager to tap the market for well-heeled travelers, have 
cleared a variety of environmental hurdles and are planning three giant 
developments that will forever change stretches of the Orange County coastline. 
</P>
<P>
Within the next four years, nearly 5,000 additional resort hotel rooms will be 
built along the coast from Huntington Beach to Dana Point. The construction 
promises to transform the coastline into an area that the tourism industry, 
with characteristic boosterism, claims will one day be known around the world 
as the Orange Coast Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
In April, construction is scheduled to begin on a four-hotel 1,450-room 
development on 20 acres along Pacific Coast Highway in Huntington Beach called 
the Waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
In May, construction will begin on the Monarch Beach Resort, a $300-million, 
1,126-room extravaganza located on one of the last untouched strips of land 
along Coast Highway, just north of the Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point. The ocean 
bluff project is a joint venture of Stein-Brief Inc., and the Hemmeter Corp., 
famous for its elaborate Hawaiian resorts. They are spending nearly $20 million 
on landscaping alone for the development. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unfazed by Slump 
</P>
<P>
And by 1990, the Irvine Co. plans to begin construction on the first of three 
hotels with a total of 2,150 rooms and two 18-hole golf courses on one of the 
choicest pieces of real estate in Southern California, a three-mile strip of 
rolling hills between Laguna Beach and Corona Del Mar called the Irvine Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a general slump in the Orange County hotel market, developers are 
confident that there will be enough tourists to back up this unprecedented 
building spree. Some assert that demand for these huge seaside resorts has gone 
unmet for years. Others say that even if adequate demand does not yet exist, it 
can be created with savvy marketing. 
</P>
<P>
"Resort development is hot across the country. People are taking more 
vacations. Travel is up, and more foreigners are coming here," said James Burba 
of Pannell Kerr Forster, a consulting firm serving the hotel industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The Ritz opened everyone's mind to the idea that here is a real resort area," 
said Sherrie Laveroni, general manager of the Dana Point Resort. 
</P>
<P>
The Ritz-Carlton, jointly owned by Prudential Insurance Co. of America and 
Atlanta-based W. B. Properties, Inc., billed itself as the first major resort 
built along the Southern California coast in nearly 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Besides its seaside locale, the $100-million project boasts tennis courts, 
swimming pools, meticulous service and a collection of 18th Century art on its 
walls. The hotel has won five stars -- the highest award -- from both the Mobil 
Travel Guide and the American Automobile Assn., two of the more prestigious 
honors in the U.S. travel industry. 
</P>
<P>
Its look and feel have been compared to opulent turn-of-the-century seaside 
resorts. But its rates are definitely modern, with rooms starting at $185 a 
night and going up to $2,000 for a five-bedroom suite with a baby grand piano. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Developments Mushrooming 
</P>
<P>
After a rocky first year marked by a protracted battle with creditors, which 
was eventually settled, the Ritz-Carlton became profitable by 1986. According 
to general manager Henry E. Schielein, the hotel's occupancy rate in 1988 was 
well above the Orange County average of 69%, and its revenue was between $45 
million and $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
Room rates at the Dana Point Resort range from $160 to $1,050 per night, 
Laveroni said. The hotel, owned by Ed and Tom Slatkin (sons of Burton Slatkin, 
the former owner of Beverly Hills Hotel), claimed a 50% occupancy rate in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Ritz-Carlton opened in 1984, coastal hotel development has progressed 
at a good clip from Santa Barbara to San Diego, according to numbers recently 
compiled by Laventhol &amp; Horwath, the accounting and consulting firm. In 
1985, there were only 13 "upscale water-oriented hotels" along the Southern 
California coast, with 4,500 rooms. By 1988, there were 21 such hotels with 
7,500 rooms. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, several new seaside resorts are under consideration 
along the Palos Verdes coastline, including another Ritz-Carlton hotel about 
two miles south of the former Marineland aquatic park site. In northern San 
Diego County, developers expect to complete 1,500 new rooms in 1989 from Del 
Mar to Oceanside, according to the San Diego Convention and Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
But local developers assert that the strip of resorts along the Orange County 
coast will be more distinctive, more elaborate and more luxurious than the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Their intention is to turn the area into a tourist destination in itself, not 
just a place to recuperate from day trips to Disneyland, Sea World or Knott's 
Berry Farm. These resorts don't plan to compete with nearby inland lodges or 
with other seaside hotels, but with resorts in Hawaii, Palm Springs, 
Scottsdale, Ariz., and, yes, even Monte Carlo. 
</P>
<P>
Can Orange County -- once considered a byword for provincialism in some circles 
-- draw the same well-heeled travelers who patronize resorts like Palm Springs? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aura of Sophistication 
</P>
<P>
Industry experts say the jury is still out. A lot depends on whether the new 
hotels scheduled for construction live up to their billing and are snazzy 
enough to complement the Ritz-Carlton. 
</P>
<P>
According to general manager Schielein, the Ritz-Carlton's reputation is 
drawing a steady stream of vacationers from Europe and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
But while the upper-crust, international flavor of the Ritz-Carlton has 
provided an aura of sophistication to the Orange County resort concept, its 
potential primarily reflects economic and demographic growth within the greater 
Los Angeles area, industry experts said. 
</P>
<P>
Schielein, in fact, acknowledged that virtually all of the Ritz-Carlton's 
weekend guests are Californians. Of those who sign on for longer stays, most 
hail from California or other Western states. 
</P>
<P>
"The Orange County coast's greatest asset is that it is adjacent to a nearly 
14-million-person market in Southern California, and the Northern California 
market is certainly available to it," said Sam L. Van Landingham, a partner 
with Portman Properties, a Atlanta development firm that has built posh hotels 
from New York to San Francisco and the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly the success of the Ritz-Carlton is supported primarily by Southern 
California. And a larger critical mass of hotels along the Irvine Coast and 
South County coast can be successful," said Van Landingham, a former Irvine Co. 
executive who was in charge of the company's hotel development. 
</P>
<P>
"How successful it will be on an international or national basis is harder to 
determine," Landingham said. "It doesn't have a year-round climate, like 
Hawaii, so it's not a true year-round ocean resort." 
</P>
<P>
One thing working in its favor is that the coastal resort market appears to be 
far from saturated. 
</P>
<P>
"For the inland hotels, there has been an oversupply that has come into the 
market. But the coastal resorts are quite different animals," said Donald 
Engfer, head of hotel development for the Irvine Co. "There is an established 
pattern of coastal tourism in California, but there has been comparatively 
little development over the years." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Receptive 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, the creation of the California Coastal Commission put a halt to most 
large seaside hotel developments. In its early years, the commission was guided 
by a strict interpretation of its mandate to manage coastal resources that 
blocked most development. But since Gov. Deukmejian took office in 1983, the 
12-member board has become more receptive to developers. 
</P>
<P>
Hotels also seem to be one of the paths of least resistance for developers 
faced with hostile environmentalists. A resort often leaves much more open 
space and has less impact on the environment than dense clusters of housing. 
</P>
<P>
"The coastal (conservation) act does favor the development of tourist 
facilities, particularly when it is done in a such a way that it increases 
access to the coast for both paying and non-paying visitors," said Jack 
Liebster, a spokesman for the commission. "Developers have gotten better at 
this." 
</P>
<P>
The Ritz-Carlton, which built a public parking lot and a path down to the 
beach, is "a perfect example," Liebster said. 
</P>
<P>
And the Irvine Co. began to make changes in its plans for the Irvine Coast 10 
years ago in the face of resistance from citizens. Originally, the company 
planned to build 21,000 homes and two 10-story office towers on the parcel, 
among other things; then the Coastal Commission came along and everything 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually the Irvine Co. agreed to let environmentalists help plan a new 
development and sold land it had originally intended for houses on the ocean 
side of Pacific Coast Highway to the state for a park in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a blueprint that includes 2,600 homes and three hotels perched 
along the hills, which even environmentalists grudgingly approve. About 
three-quarters of the land will remain open. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Changes Coast Forever' 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it, developments like these are going to have an impact. They're 
going to change the whole coast forever," said Judy Rosener, assistant dean at 
the Graduate School of Management at UC Irvine and a former Coastal Commission 
member with environmentalist leanings. 
</P>
<P>
"But there's no question the development we have now is better than it would 
have been" without the time-out imposed by the commission, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the excitement over the coming resorts, industry consultants warn 
that making a luxury hotel work is a tricky proposition. 
</P>
<P>
A rough rule of thumb in the hotel industry is that a project will not pay off 
unless it can charge $1 in room rates for each $1,000 spent building a room. At 
the Ritz-Carlton, which cost about $100 million, that translates to about $250 
a night. 
</P>
<P>
While the Ritz won't divulge its average room rate, it says it falls within a 
range of $200 to $250 a night. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the average falls somewhat short of the mark, upscale hotels like the 
Ritz-Carlton have other sources of revenue that can push the hotel into the 
black, such as food and alcohol sales and special events, including wedding 
receptions. 
</P>
<P>
"The Ritz was a calculated risk, and it paid off," said Christopher B. 
Leinberger, managing partner of Robert Charles Lesser &amp; Co., a real estate 
consulting firm based in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"But that high-end group of the hotel market is so hyper-discretionary that you 
have to give them exactly what they want and when they want it," he said. "And 
if they don't like what you give them, they'll go back to their friends at the 
country clubs and spread the word. Then the hotel will fail." 
</P>
<P>
And there is concern that California laws requiring open public access to all 
beaches might compromise efforts by resort operators to create an exclusive 
ambiance. 
</P>
<P>
Boosters, however, counter that being on the beach really isn't as important as 
being able to see it, especially since Orange County's resorts are designed to 
be centered around golf, tennis and shopping. 
</P>
<P>
"The best situation is to have a private beach," acknowledged the 
Ritz-Carlton's Schielein. 
</P>
<P>
"But the second best is to have this beautiful (public) beach, the sunset in 
the evening and the fresh sea breeze . . . In the summer the beaches do get 
crowded, but we are perched on a bluff 150 feet above it all."

INSTEAD OF GRIPING ABOUT DIFFICULTY OF LURING EXECUTIVES HERE, FIRMS SHOULD 
RECRUIT LOCALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Feb. 16 story, "It's Hard to Draw Executive Talent to the Southland," 
missed some very important points. The main one is that there is a large and 
growing pool of unemployed executives already here as a result of the numerous 
plant closures, reorganizations and consolidations in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
These displaced executives already have homes here that they purchased before 
the most recent rounds of skyrocketing real estate prices. They also have 
adjusted their psyches to the traffic, earthquakes, culture and politics, and 
their lungs to our air. They don't require $50,000 relocation packages. 
</P>
<P>
Being one of these displaced executives, I can fully understand why the article 
implies that the only worthwhile talent exists outside our area and doesn't 
want to come here. The writer may have felt that this was the case, having been 
so informed by the headhunters he interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Headhunters seem to avoid anyone who is unemployed as being some kind of a 
burned-out loser, especially if he or she is 50 or older. Their mode of 
operation seems to be to raid the client's competitors. Perhaps this builds 
their business since each time they fill a job they create an opportunity for 
another headhunter. That way they perpetuate the game of musical chairs 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
The Southland's chief executives would be well advised to eliminate these 
relocation problems and hire the top executives that are readily and locally 
available.

HAVE S&amp;LS OUTLIVED THEIR USEFULNESS?; 
</P>
<P>
MANY EXPERTS QUESTION WHETHER TRADITIONAL THRIFT FUNCTIONS NEED TO BE A 
SEPARATE INDUSTRY OR JUST ANOTHER BANKING OPTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The savings and loan industry was established in the United States mainly to 
help ordinary people save money and buy homes. Deregulation of financial 
services in the 1980s, however, brought consumers more savings and home finance 
options and blurred the distinction among banks, S&amp;L and, to a lesser 
extent, investment firms. At the same time, the S&amp;L industry -- racked by 
fraud, bad management and unpredictable interest rates -- has seen many of its 
members fall into deep trouble, and President Bush has proposed a bailout plan 
expected to cost taxpayers billions. Given these developments, is there still 
justification for a separate S&amp;L industry with a special status under U.S. 
law? Do we still need S&amp;Ls, or should we let them become banks and compete 
under the same rules that banks do? Free-lance writer Meredith Chen asked a 
number of authorities these questions, and their answers follow: 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Gnaizda, staff attorney with Public Advocates Inc., which represents 
the Urban League and the Latino Issues Forum: 
</P>
<P>
"If the primary function of savings and loans is affordable home mortgages, 
then we need them. If their only function is home mortgages for the affluent, 
then we don't need them. 
</P>
<P>
"They must provide affordable home loans. . . . They need to go into 
communities that have been frozen out of the economy by banks and savings and 
loans and aggressively assist development there. 
</P>
<P>
"The Federal Home Loan Bank data shows that a white person living in an 
integrated neighborhood has as difficult a time getting a loan, even if 
affluent, as a poor white living in an all-white neighborhood. There is 
prejudice even against integration. 
</P>
<P>
"We basically have to consider what the function of the savings and loan 
industry is supposed to be. If it is to be essentially identical to that of 
banks or what is has been in the 1980s, then we don't need a special 
institution. If it is to take on the mission that many of its leaders still 
believe should be its primary mission, and do it with skill and commitment, 
then I say we should consider special tax credits to assist the industry rather 
than the very onerous burden that President Bush is seeking to impose on the 
industry. The President's burden will eliminate the industry. There is no 
question about it." 
</P>
<P>
James F. Montgomery, chairman and chief executive of Great Western Financial 
Corp.: 
</P>
<P>
"Bad apples spoil the barrel, and they should be taken out of business. We've 
done some dumb things with deregulation that have caused some problems, but the 
savings and loan business is still making half the mortgage loans in America, 
and we don't want to take away half the mortgage lending in America. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe that we can just glibly say that we can eliminate the bad and 
replace those loans with something else. That is just not going to happen. We 
need the thrift industry and we're going to continue to make mortgage loans, 
and that is important to people and important to America." 
</P>
<P>
R. Dan Brumbaugh Jr., author of "Thrifts Under Siege: Restoring Order to 
American Banking" and a former deputy chief economist at the Federal Home Loan 
Bank Board: 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need savings and loans in the traditional sense. I say this because 
in a recent study that I did with Andrew Carron of First Boston Corp., we 
examined many aspects of the performance of mortgages in the portfolios of 
thrift institutions. What we found was that when you adjust the return on 
fixed-rate residential mortgages . . . and take into consideration the 
prepayment option that the homeowners have, they basically have not made money 
with those mortgages holding them in portfolio in the 1980s. This means that 
they can't really make money on that aspect of their portfolio which gives them 
their unique reason for being. 
</P>
<P>
"These institutions (should be able) to meet changing conditions in the market. 
Those institutions which we now call thrift institutions ought to evolve into 
institutions which more closely resemble commercial banks. 
</P>
<P>
"Both banks and thrifts are fighting for their lives. Banks provide high-cost 
information, and telecommunications and computer technology are making it less 
expensive for borrowers and lenders to get that information themselves. And 
they are getting together without banks and thrifts." 
</P>
<P>
Anthony M. Frank, U.S. postmaster general and former chairman and chief 
executive of First Nationwide Bank: 
</P>
<P>
"I think we should have two kinds of banks in this country, and I always have. 
There should be family banks and corporate banks, or commercial banks and 
retail banks, or savings banks and commercial banks -- one of those three sets 
of pairs. 
</P>
<P>
"The distinction between them should be that if more than half of your assets 
and liabilities are in corporations, then you are a commercial bank. If more 
than half goes to serving people directly, then you are a retail or a family or 
a savings bank. I don't want to see that distinction lost. 
</P>
<P>
"We have some systemic problems in our country. The low rate of savings is one 
of them. What do savings and loans basically do? They combine the savings 
accounts of 10 families and they lend it to another family. They aggregate 
little dribs and drabs of savings that nobody else is interested in. Here we 
have a 3% savings rate in this country compared to the high teens in Germany 
and 20% in Japan, and now we are going to eliminate one of the few ways people 
can save. I don't think it is a very intelligent thing. 
</P>
<P>
"Our proportion of home ownership is going down in this country. Home ownership 
is the glue that holds this country together and provides emotional and 
financial stability. It holds a family together. Savings and home loans are two 
of the most important consumer aspects of our country." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Jolson, an analyst with the Montgomery Securities investment firm: 
</P>
<P>
"There needs to be an industry dedicated and regulated to providing funds for 
the housing industry. You need an industry that is going to have some incentive 
to favor housing with their funds. 
</P>
<P>
"How many banks have made home loans? If you look historically at the amount of 
home loans that are owned by commercial banks, it is extremely low relative to 
the size of banks. Less than 20% of all home mortgages are owned by banks. That 
is not very much. Who else is going to provide this financing for home loans is 
the question. 
</P>
<P>
"The insurance companies, the commercial banks and Wall Street, the three large 
investors in loans and credit, are only interested when times are good. They 
don't have a firm commitment in all parts of the cycle to this business. 
</P>
<P>
"If you make the funding source for homes into a cyclical beast, it is going to 
be volatile like the stock market. Housing values could go up and down in a 
couple of years by 20% and that doesn't promote confidence in buying a home as 
safe investment." 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth T. Rosen, chair of the Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at UC 
Berkeley: 
</P>
<P>
"In California, the savings and loans have originated about 65% of home 
mortgage credits. If you believe that people need to buy houses, you need 
savings and loans because commercial banks are not going to do it on a regular 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
"The large savings and loans in California are quite profitable and you can 
make good money on them. They have to be more efficient operations than they 
had to be five years ago because there is a lot more competition now. Seventy 
percent of the savings and loans in this country are both profitable and 
healthy. It is very important to realize that, in California, we've had maybe 
four or five major cases of fraud. Other than that, they are all doing just 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
"The savings and loans were deregulated in 1982 in terms of assets and 
liabilities, and unfortunately they were allowed to have asset powers that are 
too broad. They have to be watched. . . . I am very optimistic that if savings 
and loans that are healthy are allowed to continue to function in a separate, 
independent fashion, they will do fine."

GIVE APPLE ITS DUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the Feb. 19 story, "Apple: Has It Lost Its Bite?": 
</P>
<P>
I don't know how many articles I've read about Apple that cite the company's 
visionary film clip of the futuristic, notebook-sized, talking computer called 
Knowledge Navigator, then disparage Apple President John Sculley for his lack 
of vision and, finally, conclude that Macintosh technology is fine for 
yesterday but not tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
The ridiculousness of these contradictory points has never been made so clear 
to me than by The Times' accompanying article about Apple's new Hyper TV. This 
software and hardware technique makes real-time video images appear on the 
screen of a Macintosh. This dramatic technological feat is one of the parts 
required to make the Knowledge Navigator work. 
</P>
<P>
I submit that: Apple's vision is to make the Knowledge Navigator; that Sculley 
will be celebrated for fostering this vision, and that the Macintosh technology 
is evolving more rapidly toward this end than most people suspect.

<TEXT>
<P>
Every other year, the vultures appear on the doorstep of Apple Computer. You 
gave them plenty of coverage. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, if you think the Macintosh isn't innovative, then what is? 
Presentation Manager and Windows software for IBM-compatible computers are 
Macintosh knock-offs. The Next computer is gorgeous, but come on, it looks like 
a high-resolution Macintosh. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is, Macintosh is a great, great product. Every major criticism of the 
Macintosh in its first two years has been addressed over the last three, and 
now Apple offers the simplicity and consistency of Macintosh in just about any 
form you like. People like to use it, and customer loyalty is phenomenal -- a 
rare quality among American products today. 
</P>
<P>
And if the hardware has reached a stage of mere evolutionary development, the 
software hasn't. A revolutionary product such as HyperCard software, introduced 
just a year ago, is so distinctive that your article failed dismally to explain 
what it is (it's a lot sexier than just an "information indexing system"). And 
Macintosh remains the platform on which "insanely great" software is showcased. 
</P>
<P>
Apple co-founder Steve Jobs is probably a genius, a man who not only 
understands the potential of the relationship between people and technology, 
but cares more about doing what's right than doing what's profitable, and Apple 
probably misses his relentless pursuit of great ideas. But, let's not forget, 
Jobs' Apple Computer also gave the world the Apple III and Lisa debacles.

LAKE MICHIGAN SERENADED BY 'SINGING SAND' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES HILLINGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
HOFFMASTER STATE PARK, Mich. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The theater is darkened, engulfed in the sound of crashing waves, as the story 
of sand dune creation unfolds on screen. First comes formation of the beach -- 
fore dune, trough, back dune and barrier dune. A fragile environment springs to 
life next, grasses at first, followed by woody plants and eventually a forest 
of hemlock and sugar maple on the back and barrier dunes. 
</P>
<P>
The theater is part of this 1,054-acre park established in 1967 to protect and 
preserve Lake Michigan's 2 1/2-mile stretch of towering sand dunes. The park's 
centerpiece is the 13-year-old Genevieve Gillette Nature Center, a $500,000 
complex including the Sand Dune Theater dedicated to the interpretation of sand 
piles. 
</P>
<P>
"Dunes are home to many unique plants and animals," said Earl Wolf, 37, a park 
naturalist here for the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The giant sand piles along the eastern shore of Lake Michigan collectively 
represent the world's largest accumulation of sand dunes bordering fresh water. 
Michigan, with its unique Sand Dune Protection and Management Statute, has 
275,000 acres of sand dunes, 40% in public ownership. 
</P>
<P>
Snow often covers the dunes this time of year and visitors can be seen 
navigating the park's 10-mile trail on snow shoes or skis. They are accompanied 
by a symphony of chirping birds -- including black cap chickadees, 
white-breasted nut hatches, tufted titmice, blue jays, red-bellied woodpeckers 
and meadowlarks -- and squirrels who scamper across the snow amid a maze tracks 
left by red fox and white-tail deer. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, tiny spring peeper frogs will be peeping robustly as colorful painted 
turtles scurry about with spotted salamanders and other wildlife. And as the 
snow melts, visitors to the ice-clogged shoreline will experience "singing 
sand," a sound heard few places on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very special tune played by the sand," said park ranger Elizabeth 
Brockwell, 23. "You scoot your feet along the beach and when the right amount 
of moisture is present, tiny sand particles scrape against each other and emit 
a peculiar musical whistle or squeaking sound." 
</P>
<P>
The center is filled with graphics describing dune formation and growth here 
and throughout the world. Exhibits portray plants and animals found in sand 
dune ecosystems and a gallery is devoted to works by Jeanne Rockette and other 
Michigan sand dune artists. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors, including thousands of schoolchildren, ascend the wooden Dune Climb 
Stairway that winds to the top of 220-foot-high Sugar Hill and overlooks 
190-foot Mt. Baldy and a breathtaking sweep one of Michigan's most scenic 
beaches. 
</P>
<P>
The park is named after the late P. J. (Pete) Hoffmaster, Michigan's first 
superintendent of parks; the sand dune museum in honor of Genevieve Gillette, 
who died two years ago at 88. 
</P>
<P>
Known as Michigan's "Miss State Park," Gillette was the first woman to receive 
a degree in landscape architecture at an American university (Michigan State). 
From the 1920s until her death, she was a leader in establishing Michigan's 
park system. Gillette wrote Michigan's wilderness bill, was the first president 
of Michigan's Parks Assn. and was named to the 12-member Citizen's Advisory 
Committee on Recreation and Natural Beauty by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 
1966.

EUROPE REACHES FOR A POSTWAR DREAM -- UNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TYLER MARSHALL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BRUSSELS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Europe's history is littered with noble ideas and broken dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Now there is a new dream: Unity. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve West European nations, among them countries whose differences dragged 
the world to war twice in this century, have pledged to complete by 1992 what 
was once dismissed as impossible -- an end to frontiers and creation of a 
single unified marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
If they succeed -- and during the past year realists have begun to join 
dreamers in predicting that they might -- the result will reshape the Continent 
and drastically affect the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. Role Sought 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the trade aspects of the 1992 reforms are viewed as so pivotal 
that Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher recently shocked Europeans by 
calling for a direct American role in the process. 
</P>
<P>
"I have advocated a seat at the table at least as an observer," Mosbacher told 
a Washington audience. 
</P>
<P>
"The European Community's single market may prove to be one of the seminal 
events of the latter half of the 20th Century," two of the United States' most 
experienced foreign affairs experts, former Deputy Secretary of State Warren M. 
Christopher and Deputy Secretary of State-designate Lawrence S. Eagleburger, 
advised President Bush in a foreign policy analysis. 
</P>
<P>
A unified European Community of Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, Spain, 
The Netherlands, Belgium, Greece, Ireland, Denmark, Portugal and Luxembourg 
would constitute the world's largest single consumer market with a population a 
third larger than that of the United States and a trading volume more than 
twice that of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
For the United States, the Common Market nations collectively constitute a 
$1-trillion commercial relationship, by far the single largest American 
international commitment, dwarfing that with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Should protectionist pressures turn this fast-emerging internal market into a 
"Fortress Europe," the consequences would be disastrous both for United States 
and other global traders. 
</P>
<P>
The new momentum propelling the European Community toward its goals has revived 
the continent's flagging spirits, dissipating the pessimism that paralyzed it 
through much of the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Collectively, its leaders have discovered, Europe matters. 
</P>
<P>
As bureaucrats struggle to dismantle myriad barriers by 1992, visionaries talk 
of grander goals: a common European currency, a popularly elected president 
and, eventually, full political union. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Youth Enthusiastic 
</P>
<P>
"It's our answer to perestroika and Reaganomics," said Gerhard Fels, head of 
the Institute for the German Economy in Cologne. "For young people there's an 
attraction, an enthusiasm about what is happening within the EC." 
</P>
<P>
Community nations have also agreed to draw up a charter of workers' rights and 
to harmonize health and safety standards. They have earmarked $60 billion by 
1993 to cushion the impact of a single market on poor or declining regions. 
</P>
<P>
Vague ideas of European unity floated from the ashes of both world wars, but it 
was an unassuming French diplomat, Jean Monnet, who gave shape and substance to 
the present drive. 
</P>
<P>
His vision was a United States of Europe, not of "coalitions between states, 
but union among people"; and in 1950, Monnet's plan for the war-ravaged French 
and German coal and steel industries to join in a common market also open to 
other countries became the precursor to the European Community. 
</P>
<P>
The 1955 treaty establishing the European Community also cemented Franco-German 
reconciliation, a relationship that remains the pivotal link in the present 
drive toward European unity. 
</P>
<P>
The original community of six countries now has 12 member states, and the list 
of those interested grows. 
</P>
<P>
Turkey has formally applied to join; Austria, Sweden and Switzerland, which 
once rejected membership as compromising their political neutrality, are 
reviewing their position, while Cyprus, Malta and Morocco have contemplated 
membership. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Norway Expected to Join 
</P>
<P>
Even Norway, the only country to reject membership (in 1973), is eventually 
expected to reverse itself and join. 
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by a new international spirit of detente, leaders of community countries 
have responded to the exhortations of EC Commission President Jacques Delors 
that achieving the single market by 1992 is "a race . . . which the countries 
of Europe have to win to survive." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the commission even calculated the cost of failure: $200 billion per 
year, up to 7% lost economic growth, 5 million jobs and continued 
fragmentation. 
</P>
<P>
As economic interests of European Community member states converge, so too does 
cooperation in other fields. 
</P>
<P>
A structure for political cooperation is already in place and joint stands, 
most recently in withdrawing all 12 ambassadors from Tehran in response to the 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's death threat against British author Salman 
Rushdie, make its voice count. 
</P>
<P>
The European Community has invoked limited punitive measures against Libya, 
Syria and Argentina; it has its own policies on the Middle East and South 
Africa, and conducts its own dialogue with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
An emerging concept of European political identity is even visible in news 
headlines: "Europe pushes U.S. on Arafat"; "Khomeini gets Euro-snub." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Military Cooperation 
</P>
<P>
Member nations have increased defense cooperation, and those involved in the 
march toward a more unified Europe believe a greater degree of mutual security 
interests is also bound to emerge, either within the community framework or in 
some parallel organization. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is unavoidable," said Frans Andriessen, EC Commissioner for 
External Relations, in an interview. "We can't escape a security dimension 
linked to this integration process." 
</P>
<P>
A stronger, more unified European voice within the Atlantic Alliance at a time 
when Americans and Europeans appear to be diverging on the ways to meet a 
changing Soviet threat carries its own implications: roughly half the 
$300-billion U.S. defense budget is committed to the defense of Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Viewed from a distance, the compelling logic of a truly unified European 
Community would seem to make the 1992 goals a foregone conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
But however strong the commitment to the ideal, the prospect of it becoming one 
more broken dream, crushed by powerful, divisive national interests remains 
real. 
</P>
<P>
How, for example, can border controls be eliminated in countries like Britain, 
an island nation which has traditionally relied on them as a key law 
enforcement tool? Where is the common ground for an automobile sales tax that 
currently ranges from 12% in Luxembourg to 200% in Denmark? 
</P>
<P>
How is it possible, skeptics ask, to take a European unity movement seriously 
when tiny Belgium, a country whose population is smaller than that of New York 
City, remains hopelessly divided by a chronic Flemish-Walloon rivalry? 
</P>
<P>
Even the shape and depth of European unity is disputed. 
</P>
<P>
As French President Francois Mitterrand echoes Monnet's dream of a United 
States of Europe, Britain's Margaret Thatcher exudes suspicion and warns of "a 
European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels". 
</P>
<P>
Amid allegations of massive fraud swirling around the European Community's 
large farm subsidy program, the director-general of Britain's Institute of 
Directors, John Hoskyns, leveled far more serious charges, claiming the 
community's drive toward a single market showed "growing evidence of confused 
objectives, protectionism, cynical disregard of community rules, dreams of 
'60s-style social engineering, administrative incompetence, bureaucratic 
dishonesty and fraud." 
</P>
<P>
"We had -- and have -- the makings of a fiasco," he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Even the smallest issues evoke bitter disputes. 
</P>
<P>
West Germans were outraged when the community, in the interest of 
harmonization, tossed out a 16th-Century German law forbidding the sale of beer 
with additives and were quickly insulted further by a similar ruling on 
sausages. 
</P>
<P>
Equally incensed French hunters recently turned out en masse to protest a 
European Community conservation measure curtailing the bird-hunting season by a 
third. 
</P>
<P>
"Hunters: Fire on Europe!" the leading Paris daily Liberation urged. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a British member of the European Parliament, Carol Tongue, marshaled 
bird-loving Britons in a futile mini-crusade against community plans to slap a 
tax on birdseed. 
</P>
<P>
Only the Italians seem unreservedly enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can Only Improve 
</P>
<P>
"What can be worse than what we already have here," chirped a senior civil 
servant in Rome during a discourse on Italy's bureaucratic morass. 
</P>
<P>
But barriers are falling, and as they do, resistance to further change is 
certain to rise. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, commission officials believe one key reason for the European 
Community's present momentum toward 1992 is the widespread ignorance about just 
how sweeping the proposed changes really are. 
</P>
<P>
It is only now beginning to sink in, for example, that exposing long-pampered 
national industries to the free-for-all competition of an open internal market 
will unleash nothing less than the restructuring of European industry. 
</P>
<P>
"I get the sense that the business community is just now coming to grips with 
what's been happening," said Alfred H. Kingon, U.S. ambassador to the European 
Community. 
</P>
<P>
Added West German economist Fels: "If the potential losers in this knew their 
fate, they could form a coalition to block it all. The uncertainty is the 
reformers' biggest benefit." 
</P>
<P>
The current extent of protectionism is reflected in a single statistic: less 
than 2% of the estimated $300 billion in annual governmental contracts awarded 
within the 12 community nations goes to a company from a second country. 
</P>
<P>
If business is just waking up to the revolution about to overtake them, the 
general population remains curiously asleep. 
</P>
<P>
For despite the vast reach of the changes under way, ordinary Europeans remain 
largely detached from the developments that will shape much of their future. 
</P>
<P>
As a gripping issue, 1992 is a flop. The British and Dutch governments are so 
concerned at the lack of awareness that they hired ad agencies to promote the 
issue. West Germany is considering the same. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Voters Indifferent 
</P>
<P>
Not even next June's community-wide elections for a new European Parliament 
have stirred interest. 
</P>
<P>
A recent election in southern England to fill a vacant European parliamentary 
seat set a record for voter apathy with a 14% turnout. 
</P>
<P>
But even if opposition should grow, the momentum toward 1992 will be difficult 
to stop. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, considerable chunks of national sovereignty have already gone to 
Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
The European Community has altered the terms of a British airline merger, 
demanded changes in the relationship between the French government and its 
state-owned auto giant, Renault, and insisted that any Italian state aid to its 
steel industry include modernization measures. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement that sent shock waves through national capitals and parliaments, 
Delors last year confidently predicted that within a decade, "80% of the 
economic legislation and, perhaps, tax and social legislation will be decided 
at the community level." 
</P>
<P>
Peter Ludlow, director of the Center for European Policy Studies here, noted 
that environmental legislation placed before the British Parliament in recent 
years is already more than 80% of European Community origin. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult to see how the process can be reversed at this point," 
Ludlow said. 
</P>
<P>
A sense of urgency and mission pervades the 13-story glass labyrinth that is 
home to the community's 8,000 bureaucrats. Here, 14-hour days and late evening 
meetings are standard fare for those charged with steering the endless, often 
emotional compromises required. 
</P>
<P>
But recent breakthroughs have instilled a confidence that is visible. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an excitement, a challenge you can detect now," said Neville Kerry, a 
former member of the Irish Senate and now part of what he calls the largest 
press operation outside the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Monnet's disciples now speak of 1992 as merely a way station on the path to a 
single European currency and movement toward political unity. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course it will take a long time," Edith Cresson, French minister for 
European affairs, said in an interview. "But perhaps in 20 or 30 years, we will 
have something that looks like the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe not quite the same, but something like it."

FBI PUTS TOP PRIORITY ON BOMBED VAN; 
</P>
<P>
FEDERAL EXPERTS COMB SITE IN LA JOLLA FOR POSSIBLE TERRORISM

<P>
Assembling an elite team of experts and assigning the case "the very highest 
priority," federal officials intensified their investigation Saturday into the 
pipe-bombing of a van being driven by the wife of Will Rogers III, captain of 
the San Diego-based guided missile cruiser Vincennes. 
</P>
<P>
Searching for hard evidence linking the bombing to international terrorists, 
about 30 federal investigators meticulously combed a La Jolla intersection with 
brooms and metal detectors, sweeping through plants, trees and construction 
sites, and even the nearby roofs of stores and shops. The burned-out vehicle, 
from which Sharon Rogers escaped uninjured from the bombing attack Friday, was 
towed from the scene about 5 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mistaken Attack 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Rogers ordered the Vincennes to fire on an approaching aircraft last July 
while the ship was on duty in the Persian Gulf, mistakenly thinking the plane 
was an attacking Iranian jet fighter. Instead, it was an Iranian commercial 
jetliner, which was brought down, killing all 290 people aboard. Iranian 
leaders at the time vowed revenge for the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Saturday, the Navy confirmed reports in The New York Times and 
Washington Post from anonymous sources in Washington that Sharon Rogers had 
received a threatening telephone call last summer. On Friday, a Navy spokesman 
had repeatedly denied there had been such a threat. He said Saturday that he 
had been unaware of the episode, despite reports that a security alert went out 
to all 350 members of the Vincennes crew after the Navy was notified of the 
call. 
</P>
<P>
At the scene of the bombing Saturday, "teams of investigators are running out 
just hundreds and hundreds of leads," said Tom A. Hughes, special agent in 
charge of the FBI office in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"There are fragments that would lead one to believe this is a pipe bomb," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "we're not in a position to confirm what kind of device it was." 
</P>
<P>
Navy sources in Washington and San Diego said Saturday that they were 
hesitating to label the attack a clear-cut case of political terrorism because 
other motives had not been ruled out. "We're really not sure it's a terrorist. 
It could be a disgruntled sailor or something else altogether," one source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Highest Priority' 
</P>
<P>
"The FBI has assigned the very highest priority to this case, but hasn't made 
the call on whether it's a terrorist act or not, although it sure looks that 
way," said one high law enforcement official in the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
Another Navy source pointed to the attempted bombing of a car belonging to 
Capt. Kenneth R. Barry, commanding officer of the Pelelieu, an amphibious 
helicopter landing ship based in Long Beach. That incident was blamed on a 
disgruntled sailor, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
Barry escaped injury in March, 1987, when a pipe bomb rigged to his car failed 
to go off. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, FBI Director William Sessions said in a press conference in Des 
Moines Saturday that Friday's bombing does not signal a "trend" in 
international terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we're seeing a trend at all," Sessions said. 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "We are deeply concerned about that kind of activity -- whether 
it is in fact a terrorist act. You just can't tell at this stage." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the bombing in San Diego on Friday, security was tightened at 
all Navy and Marine Corps installations in the area, and some rank-and-file 
sailors outside the 32nd Street Naval Station -- the main naval yard here -- 
said their superiors had cautioned them to be watchful. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Vardoman, a 20-year-old sailor from St. Louis who is based in San Diego, 
said, "They tell us how to watch our backs," referring to the increased 
security. "They told us to be more careful and take precautions." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Worldwide Order 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Lt. Cmdr. Chris Baumann, a Navy spokesman, said Saturday that no 
order has gone out to increase security at Navy installations worldwide as a 
result of the incident in San Diego. However, he said that some bases decided 
to tighten security on their own and were taking such measures as stopping cars 
and checking for identification instead of waving cars with decals through the 
gates. 
</P>
<P>
At Whidbey Island Naval Air Station in Washington state, United Press 
International reported that the base commander had ordered heightened security 
inasmuch as Whidbey-based naval ships had engaged in exchanges of fire with 
Iran vessels. 
</P>
<P>
The pipe bomb explosion Friday ripped through the Toyota van as Sharon Rogers 
was en route to her job at a La Jolla private elementary school. Hearing what 
sounded like two loud noises from underneath the vehicle, she initially thought 
a motorist had struck her from behind. Moments after she stepped out to inspect 
any possible damage, the van exploded into a fireball. 
</P>
<P>
In his account of the phone threat received by Sharon Rogers, Navy spokesman 
Cmdr. David Dillon said the call came at the Rogers' San Diego home two or 
three days after the Iranian plane was shot down last July 3. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Phone Conversation 
</P>
<P>
Dillon, a spokesman for the Pacific Surface Fleet, gave this account of the 
conversation: 
</P>
<P>
Caller: "Is this Mrs. Rogers?" 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Rogers: "Who's this?" 
</P>
<P>
Caller: "Is this Mrs. Rogers?" 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Rogers: Who is this?" 
</P>
<P>
Caller: "Are you the wife of the murderer?" 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Rogers then hung up the phone and nothing further was heard from the 
man, Dillon said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the incident was reported to the Naval Investigative Service and added 
that he knows of no other incidents approaching a threat to Rogers, his wife, 
or other Vincennes crew members. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers and his wife were trying to maintain a low profile Saturday and have 
decided not to speak to reporters, Dillon said. "We have them in a safe place," 
Dillon said. "Suddenly, it got very personal." 
</P>
<P>
At the scene of the bombing, the 30 investigators, including experts from the 
FBI bomb laboratory in Los Angeles and the agency's explosives unit in 
Washington, delicately marked, examined and removed almost every shred of 
debris along the normally busy intersection. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the cleanest street in San Diego," said San Diego Police Officer 
Thomas Mason, who was guarding the perimeter from crowds of motorists, 
bicyclists and other spectators. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hoisted Into Air 
</P>
<P>
Most of the federal agents, clad in Windbreakers, blue jumpsuits or suits and 
ties, worked throughout the day Saturday. By early afternoon, they were 
clustered around the vehicle as a Navy forklift hoisted the burned-out van five 
feet into the air. 
</P>
<P>
With a photographer snapping pictures of the van's charred rear undercarriage, 
FBI agents wearing white gloves sifted through blackened debris on the 
pavement. Plainly visible from the police perimeter were charred strips of the 
van's rear tires. 
</P>
<P>
The agents, joined by several investigators from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms and a fire investigator, placed bits of debris in glassine 
and dark plastic bags. They appeared to pay special attention to chunks of 
debris in three clear plastic bags kept separate from the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty minutes later, the van was moved over one lane to the east and lowered 
back down onto the pavement. Groups of investigators then pored over its 
interior. 
</P>
<P>
Officials also brought in a second Toyota van that Hughes said will be used to 
compare with the burned-out vehicle, and to determine if debris found from the 
explosion came from the Rogerses' van or from the explosive apparatus itself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sift Burned Debris 
</P>
<P>
Investigators also lined the street with barrels and sifted the burned debris 
through large metal sieves, and other agents were hunting through bushes, 
shrubs and on rooftops. Hughes said the evidence collected will be sent to a 
Washington laboratory for analysis. 
</P>
<P>
"We are into an exhaustive, painstaking, lengthy investigation to determine 
what type of bomb it was, what was used in it and how it was detonated," Hughes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are conducting an exhaustive investigation in a number of different 
directions." 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said no White 
House comment was planned until the FBI completes its investigation. Another 
White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said President Bush 
was "monitoring the news accounts. He's concerned about it." Times staff writer 
Leonard Bernstein also contributed to this article from San Diego. Staff 
writers Ronald J. Ostrow, Robert Jackson and John Broder reported from 
Washington.

L.A. JUDGE NAMED TO CALIF. HIGH COURT; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNOR SELECTS APPELLATE JUSTICE JOYCE L. KENNARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In a surprise move, Gov. George Deukmejian on Saturday nominated Appellate 
Justice Joyce L. Kennard, an Asian-born immigrant who spent part of her 
childhood in a World War II internment camp, to the California Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
If confirmed, Kennard, a 47-year-old former state prosecutor and now on the 
state Court of Appeal in Los Angeles, will succeed Justice John A. Arguelles, 
who retired March 1. 
</P>
<P>
While there had been speculation that the governor would name a woman to the 
high court, most of the attention had focused on Appellate Justice Patricia D. 
Benke, 39, of San Diego, whom the governor had considered for previous openings 
on the court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Radio Announcement 
</P>
<P>
But Deukmejian, after conferring with Kennard on Monday, informed her of his 
choice Friday night and announced her appointment to the $103,469-a-year post 
on his regular Saturday radio program. 
</P>
<P>
"Justice Kennard is superbly qualified and she has had a remarkable life of 
achievement and triumph over adversity," the governor said. "(She) has proved 
that hard work, skill and intelligence, combined with the promise of the 
American dream, can lead one to great achievements." 
</P>
<P>
Kennard declined Saturday to make extensive comment before her confirmation 
hearing, but did say, "I consider it a great honor to be the governor's nominee 
to the state Supreme Court. I expect now to be devoting all my efforts to 
completing my assignments on the Court of Appeal and preparing for the 
hearing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Youngest Member 
</P>
<P>
Kennard, a resident of Sherman Oaks, is a former trial court judge who was 
elevated to the Court of Appeal only a year ago and has been generally regarded 
as a judicial conservative during her relatively short time on the bench. Thus 
her move to the moderately conservative high court was seen as unlikely to 
result in a major philosophical realignment. Nonetheless, she stands to be the 
court's youngest member and could wield considerable influence in a long-term 
career. 
</P>
<P>
She would be only the second woman to serve on the state's highest court. The 
first, Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird, was defeated by the voters in the 
November, 1986, election along with Justices Cruz Reynoso and Joseph R. Grodin. 
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said Saturday that while Benke had not officially taken 
herself out of the running, she had made it clear to the governor that if 
nominated, she would not be prepared to move from a new home in San Diego she 
shares with her husband and two children, ages 5 and 7. 
</P>
<P>
Three court members currently live in Southern California and make weekly 
commutes to the court's headquarters in San Francisco. None, however, has small 
children at home. 
</P>
<P>
Benke expressed strong support Saturday for the governor's selection of 
Kennard. "I can't say that I'm not disappointed but I certainly can't complain 
about the governor's decision. Joyce is a wonderful, delightful person and 
she's going to be an outstanding member of an outstanding court." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prepared to Move 
</P>
<P>
Kennard, who is married but has no children, said that if confirmed she would 
relocate in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The new nominee was born in the Dutch East Indies, which is now Indonesia, and 
spent her childhood years on Japanese-occupied land during World War II. Her 
father, who was Dutch, died when she was an infant, and she and her mother 
spent time during the war in a camp in West Java run by mercenaries. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Kennard and her mother were able to find money to secure passage to 
Holland, where Kennard's studies at a private high school were interrupted for 
two years when she lost a leg from a life-threatening infection. 
</P>
<P>
Kennard eventually became trained as a Dutch-English interpreter and, at 20, 
came to Los Angeles and found a job as a secretary. Seven years later, her 
mother died, and Kennard used the $5,000 her mother left her to enter Pasadena 
City College. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after earning a scholarship, she transferred to USC, where she was 
graduated Phi Beta Kappa and later earned a law degree. She became a 
naturalized citizen in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Favorable Response 
</P>
<P>
Initial response to the nomination among legal authorities was favorable. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Marcus M. Kaufman said he was "gratified" the governor made the 
appointment promptly to bring the court to its full seven-member strength. 
</P>
<P>
"From all I've heard, she is very, very well-qualified and will be a welcome 
addition to the court," Kaufman said. "She will also provide a welcome feminine 
perspective that will enrich the court." 
</P>
<P>
Gerald F. Uelmen, dean of the Santa Clara Law School and an authority on the 
state high court, predicted Kennard would be confirmed quickly in view of her 
"excellent" reputation as a jurist. 
</P>
<P>
Uelmen noted, however, that Kennard had not served on the bench as long as 
previous Supreme Court appointees of the governor and thus had not established 
the same kind of judicial "track record" on which to base predictions of future 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this appointment indicates the governor is willing to take a certain 
risk in order to achieve the objective of getting a woman on the court," he 
said. "I don't think the governor would take that kind of risk if this were a 
swing-vote appointment." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confirmation Step 
</P>
<P>
Kennard still must be confirmed by the state Judicial Appointments Commission, 
which includes Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de 
Kamp and Appellate Justice Lester W. Roth of Los Angeles, the senior presiding 
justice of the state Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
It is expected that a hearing will be held by the commission in mid-April. If 
approved, Kennard could be sworn into office immediately. Meanwhile, Arguelles 
will continue to serve temporarily on the court, completing work on cases in 
which he has participated -- including the widely watched constitutional test 
of Proposition 103, the insurance reform initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Kennard, Benke and Appellate Justices H. Walter Croskey of Los Angeles and Fred 
W. Marler of Sacramento all had been under formal consideration by the governor 
for the post. In the last three months, the four potential nominees had 
undergone a confidential evaluation by a special commission of the State Bar. 
The commission's report is non-binding on the governor, but if the governor 
selects a nominee the commission has found unqualified, that fact may be 
disclosed publicly. 
</P>
<P>
Benke was one of six appellate justices considered by Deukmejian two years ago 
for the vacancies left by Bird, Reynoso and Grodin. 
</P>
<P>
Kennard, after graduation from law school in 1974, joined the attorney 
general's office in Los Angeles, working in the criminal division until 1979, 
when she took a post as a senior research attorney in the state Court of 
Appeal, handling both civil and criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Court Appointments 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Deukmejian appointed her to the Los Angeles Municipal Court and the 
next year named her to the San Fernando branch of the Los Angeles Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
In evaluations made in response to inquiries by the state attorney general's 
office when Kennard was nominated to the appellate bench last year, lawyers 
familiar with her performance as a trial court judge described her as an able, 
forceful and prosecution-oriented jurist, skilled and knowledgeable in legal 
research. One lawyer noted that despite her background as a prosecutor, she 
appeared to be "very fair" to defense attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1987, Kennard, while still on the Superior Court, sentenced a Sylmar 
man to seven years in prison -- just four months short of the maximum -- for 
shooting at a car on the Golden State Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Although occupants of the car were uninjured, the crime represented a serious 
threat to public safety, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all aware of the thousands of commuters who drive the freeways every 
day . . . and we know all too well the frustration that can be experienced from 
an inconsiderate driver," Kennard said. "But such conduct does not justify 
shooting. To tolerate such behavior would recall the days of lawlessness when 
it was the outlaw and his gun, not the law, that ruled." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Identification Issue 
</P>
<P>
In a unanimous opinion by the Court of Appeal last July, Kennard rejected 
claims by a convicted burglar that his identification by the victim soon after 
the crime was unfairly suggestive because no other people were included in a 
police "show-up" or lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"A single-person show-up is not necessarily unfair," Kennard wrote for the 
court. "The potential unfairness in singling out a suspect is offset by the 
likelihood that a prompt identification shortly after the commission of a crime 
will be more accurate than a belated identification days or weeks later." 
</P>
<P>
In a widely noted case that is now before the state Supreme Court, Kennard 
joined in an appeal court decision in January rejecting a constitutional 
challenge to the display of a Jewish menorah during the holiday season at the 
Los Angeles City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The three-judge panel agreed that the display did not violate provisions of the 
state and U.S. Constitutions barring government establishment of religion.

EX-CHP OFFICER SLAIN IN AMBUSH IS RECALLED AS A MUSCULAR ENIGMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANNE KLEIN and ERIC MALNIC, Times Staff Writers 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Horace Joseph McKenna was a man hooked on power and wealth, a hulking body 
builder who used his size to intimidate and impress -- a former cop turned bad. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna -- a 46-year-old felon with purported ties to prostitution, gambling, 
narcotics, counterfeiting and topless bars -- was gunned down Thursday while he 
slept in the back seat of his limousine as it pulled up to the gate of his 
isolated ranch estate in Brea's Carbon Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Brea police said Saturday, they have no suspects in the murder and only 
one witness: the chauffeur behind the wheel when McKenna was shot. 
</P>
<P>
But based on interviews with those who knew him, it appears that McKenna -- the 
man called "Big Mac" by his friends -- had lived as flamboyantly as he died. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Liked Flashy Clothes' 
</P>
<P>
"He liked flashy clothes, fancy cars, gold rings and the ladies," said a friend 
who first got to know McKenna 20 years ago, when both of them were California 
Highway Patrol officers. 
</P>
<P>
"He was nice to the people he liked -- didn't take advantage of them," said the 
friend, who asked not to be named. "But to people who crossed him, he 
definitely had a mean streak." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Isles, a Brea city councilman, described McKenna as "a great big guy (who) 
looked like Mr. Clean . . . one of those kind of people that if you saw him 
walking down the street at night, you'd be terrified." 
</P>
<P>
Isles said that, despite appearances, you could tell when McKenna spoke that he 
was "a gentle person." 
</P>
<P>
Others were not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said that while they found some of McKenna's many employees to be 
"extremely loyal" to him, others lived in "extreme fear" of the 300-pound, 
6-foot, 6-inch giant. 
</P>
<P>
Said Mike Tutty, a weightlifter friend interviewed at the 4 Star Gym that 
McKenna owned in El Segundo: "He was a very intimidating person. He had a big 
ego and he needed fodder for that ego. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We knew he was sent away (to prison) twice before, but most of us, we never 
discussed that kind of thing in here. You weren't going to do that in front of 
Mac. I didn't want to be a statistic, right?" 
</P>
<P>
Richard Debro, a Los Angeles attorney who represented Sherry McKenna in the 
couple's 1987 divorce, said that he saw the results of McKenna's violent nature 
in the battered face of McKenna's wife of nine years. 
</P>
<P>
"He would use drugs and become incredibly violent," Debro said, "I've seen 
(Sherry McKenna) after he had beaten her up. She'd have black eyes, things like 
that. . . . He was an awful person, a disgusting person." 
</P>
<P>
Isles said he got to know McKenna because of McKenna's problems with the exotic 
animals he kept at his estate -- a black leopard, a tiger and two spider 
monkeys that were seized by the Department of Fish and Game in June. The 
animals' future was to be decided in court on March 15. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna's own future, it seemed, was also about to be decided by the judicial 
system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Investigation Revealed 
</P>
<P>
On the day before his murder, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office 
released documents detailing its wide-ranging investigation of McKenna for 
income tax fraud, gambling, narcotics and prostitution activities. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the district attorney's office said, McKenna and the man believed 
to be his business partner, former CHP Officer Michael Woods, were alleged to 
be hidden owners of five nude and topless bars near Los Angeles International 
Airport, in Hollywood, in Lennox and in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna's criminal record shows arrests for running a prostitution ring and 
credit card forgery and convictions for assault on a police officer and 
involvement in counterfeiting. 
</P>
<P>
That all happened in the twilight and aftermath of his career as a highway 
patrolman. 
</P>
<P>
Records show that McKenna -- along with Woods and Daniel Fenton Sully, a man 
identified in the affidavits as a functionary in one of the topless bars -- all 
served together in the CHP in the late '60s and early '70s. All three were 
assigned as motorcycle patrolmen in the West Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
"I broke Mac in on motors (motorcycles)," said the friend who asked not to be 
named. "He was a likable S.O.B., a real clown. So big I said they must have 
made his (leather) jacket out of an elephant. He had a good sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
"We were working the (Sunset) Strip one night, and both of us stopped at a red 
light, side by side. This guy in an MG, next to Mac, crumples up a cigarette 
package and tosses it out on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"Mac reaches down, picks up the package, and stuffs in back in the car. 'Don't 
be littering up my streets, boy,' he tells the guy. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy looks up, sees Big Mac, and says, 'Yessir!' " 
</P>
<P>
The friend said he, McKenna and several other highway patrolmen used to stop by 
occasionally at a topless joint in Inglewood, near Los Angeles International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a few squad parties there," the friend said. "I think that's where Mac 
started going awry." 
</P>
<P>
The friend said McKenna was seduced by the excitement, the sexy women and the 
money -- "especially the money." 
</P>
<P>
It was about that time that McKenna was dismissed -- and then was allowed to 
resign -- from the department. Whether that dismissal came as a result of his 
concurrent arrest on a credit card theft count has not been made clear. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, the friend said, he pretty much lost track of him when McKenna 
left, although word drifted down that McKenna "had been locked up for 
something. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, one night, my phone rings," the friend said. "The voice says, 'It's me. 
Mac.' I ask, 'Where are you?' He says, 'Right in your driveway.' 
</P>
<P>
"I look out, and there's this big Rolls Royce -- a black, 1962 Rolls Royce. He 
had a phone in the damned thing. We rode around for a while and that was it. 
That's about the last time I saw him. 
</P>
<P>
"When things started happening to him, he didn't try to involve us. And I 
didn't ask him about it." 
</P>
<P>
But while some of his friends saw McKenna as a good cop turned bad, others saw 
him simply as a nice guy. 
</P>
<P>
Annie Null, 21, one of the four trainers McKenna employed to care for 11 
Arabian horses at his 35-acre estate's Gone With the Wind Arabians breeding 
operation, broke down in tears upon learning of his death. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a great man," she said. "He was just a good boss." 
</P>
<P>
Dana Sermas, another trainer, described her employer as a fun-loving, 
good-natured man who would entertain friends by allowing them to ride his 
horses over the rolling chaparral-covered hills surrounding his spacious home. 
She said some of the regular guests were sexily dressed young women he referred 
to as his "bimbos." 
</P>
<P>
Leah Newcomb, who used to sell McKenna feed for his horses, said that delivery 
people always made sure to call before approaching Tara Ranch, because "if not, 
these armed men would greet you. They had machine guns." 
</P>
<P>
And McKenna reportedly had some unusual habits. 
</P>
<P>
Employees at his estate said that in an effort to lose weight, McKenna, a New 
Orleans native, lived on a diet of tuna and vitamin pills and kept no other 
food in his house. 
</P>
<P>
He never drank alcoholic beverages, they said, instead favoring carbonated soft 
drinks, which he would pack in the rattlesnake skin briefcase he carried 
virtually everywhere. He was very concerned about his appearance, and had 
recently undergone a hair transplant. 
</P>
<P>
His collection of expensive pairs of boots numbered 52; he owned two 
limousines, and in addition to the exotic animals confiscated by authorities, 
he kept an Amazon parrot, pythons and boa constrictors. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Gray, owner of the Star Gym in Brea, said that he remembered McKenna 
working out at the gym on Wednesday morning, as usual. 
</P>
<P>
Like himself, Gray said, McKenna was in training for the Masters Nationals, a 
body-building contest to be held June 9 and 10 in Atlantic City, N.J. The 
winner would be crowned "Mr. America Over 40." 
</P>
<P>
Gray described his friend as someone without "a mean bone in his body," 
although he added that, "if somebody had a problem with him, the only way 
they'd get him is with a gun."

DESPITE DOUBTS ON FUNDING, COLLIDER RETAINS ITS ALLURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DYE, Times Science Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nobel laureate Leon Lederman looked over a crowd of several hundred scientists 
and industrialists attending a recent symposium in New Orleans and quipped: "We 
just want to understand how the universe works. After we have done that, we 
will go away." 
</P>
<P>
What Lederman and other high-energy physicists want is for the federal 
government to spend more than $6 billion on the largest scientific instrument 
ever built, a giant race track that they hope will smash subatomic particles 
into smaller particles than anyone has ever detected before. 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
Because physicists believe the machine, called the superconducting super 
collider, could simulate the beginning of time, opening a window on the moment 
the universe began. 
</P>
<P>
The machine will hurl two beams of protons -- atomic nuclei -- in opposite 
directions around a 53-mile race track. The violent collision of protons 
traveling at nearly the speed of light will create subatomic particles, many of 
which have not existed in nature since the beginning of time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Competition for Funds 
</P>
<P>
The proposal comes at a time of staggering federal deficits and increased 
concerns about housing for the poor, skyrocketing health costs and other 
everyday matters. Yet it enjoys widespread support in Congress among a broad 
spectrum of elected officials, many of whom are quick to admit they do not 
understand what the super collider is all about. 
</P>
<P>
"I've become a buff," said Rep. Jimmy Hayes (D-La.), who represents an 
impoverished district along the Gulf Coast. 
</P>
<P>
That kind of attitude reveals the political acumen of scientists and government 
officials who have managed to build a broad base of support for the super 
collider. Many elected officials came aboard initially because they thought the 
project might end up in their state, bringing with it thousands of jobs and the 
prestige that one of the world's premiere scientific research projects is bound 
to garner. In all, 35 sites were proposed. 
</P>
<P>
But since last January, when the U.S. Department of Energy picked a site near 
Dallas, many thought congressional support would decline quickly after 
officials realized they were not going to land the project for their areas. 
Unquestionably, some support has waned, but the project is still very much 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
More than $100 million has been spent on research and design of the instrument, 
and if the current budget request is approved, construction will begin sometime 
next year. It is scheduled for completion in 1995, but that depends on 
continued support by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought Louisiana would be a finalist," Hayes said of his state's bid 
for the project. "Unless they want to put it under water," he added in 
reference to the swamplands that cover so much of Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
At the 'Cutting Edge' 
</P>
<P>
Yet he remains committed because "the super collider is a symbol," he said in 
an interview. "This is the cutting edge of technology. If our country is not 
the symbol of scientific achievement, we will forfeit that to Europe or anyone 
else who is willing to make the investment." 
</P>
<P>
Particle physicists -- who tend to regard their role in life as virtually a 
religious calling -- tend to wax eloquent, minus the politics, when discussing 
their field. 
</P>
<P>
"High-energy physics is the ultimate extension of man's curiosity about what 
things are made of and how they work," said Harvard University Prof. Roy F. 
Schwitters, who is to serve as director of the super collider project. 
</P>
<P>
Many others, however, believe the price may simply be too high. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep asking, 'Where is the money going to come from?' " Rep. Mike Espy 
(D-Miss.) told the New Orleans symposium. 
</P>
<P>
Espy, a member of the House Budget Committee, repeatedly told the symposium 
that if the super collider is built, the cost will come out of the hide of many 
other projects, and he offered little hope that it will be funded. 
</P>
<P>
But he glanced at representatives of the Texas organization who helped win the 
project for their state and noted: 
</P>
<P>
"But you have a couple of 800-pound gorillas in your corner, and one of them is 
named George Bush." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Even Physicists Are Split 
</P>
<P>
The cost of building the super collider has split the scientific community 
because many fear it will drain funds away from other projects. Even physicists 
are not united in support of the project. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a fundamental question here," said Cornell University physicist James 
Krumhansl, president of the American Physical Society. "How do you assign 
priorities." 
</P>
<P>
Krumhansl said the cost of the super collider would double the nation's budget 
for research in physics, but the same amount of money could be used to fund the 
research of about 5,000 physicists a year in smaller grants. Many of those 
would be for research in such areas as superconductivity, which could pay 
immediate dividends, while the payoff from the super collider "will be 
essentially zero" for many years. 
</P>
<P>
While declaring that the super collider "violates the commandment that thou 
shalt not stick your finger in some other guy's goodie pie," Krumhansl 
suggested that plans to build the super collider now -- with so many other 
research projects begging for money -- may not be prudent. 
</P>
<P>
"It's (the super collider project) reasonable," he said carefully, "in its time 
and place." 
</P>
<P>
Although the super collider was conceived under the Ronald Reagan 
Administration, President Bush is believed to be a supporter. But when he was 
going over the text of his recent budget address a funny thing happened on the 
way to a joint session of Congress. Although the prepared text specifically 
pushed for the super collider, the President dropped the reference from his 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High-Profile Target 
</P>
<P>
Some believe the President decided that if he mentioned it, the super collider 
would become a high-profile target for its critics -- and there are many -- and 
he decided at the last minute to take a quieter path. That does not mean the 
Bush Administration is backing away from the project, according to Robert 
Hunter, director of the Office of Energy Research in the U.S. Department of 
Energy, which hopes to build the super collider. Hunter said in an interview 
that he fully expects the super collider to be built. 
</P>
<P>
"President Bush is not backing away from the super collider," said presidential 
science adviser William R. Graham. "He very strongly supports it." 
</P>
<P>
The betting among insiders is that the project may get the $250 million called 
for in the current budget proposal, which includes $160 million to begin the 
first stage of construction, but "year two will be much more difficult," as 
Hayes put it. Texas is putting up $1 billion toward the project. 
</P>
<P>
The schedule calls for the funding to jump to $392 million for fiscal 1991 and 
$494 million by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The total price tag has been pegged at $5.9 billion by the Department of 
Energy, but many believe that figure is actually far below what the super 
collider will ultimately cost. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'$8-Billion Project' 
</P>
<P>
"Many of my colleagues believe we are looking at an $8-billion project," said 
Rep. Carl D. Pursell (R-Mich.), a staunch supporter of the super collider 
despite the fact that his state lost out early in the competition. 
</P>
<P>
That is a lot of money for a project that is difficult to understand and may 
never directly improve the lives of the people who are asked to pay the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Since by its very nature the super collider will be designed to probe the 
unknown, no one knows what -- if any -- practical rewards the giant machine 
will yield. Its predecessors, like the world's largest collider now operating, 
the Tevatron at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory near Chicago, have 
led to applications in fields ranging from medicine to Star Wars, but no one 
knew if any practical good would come from the Tevatron before it was built. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm frequently asked, if those results were unpredicted, what are the 
unpredicted results we can expect from the super collider," said Lederman, who 
is the director of Fermilab. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the spinoffs from earlier colliders resulted from the development of 
new technologies required to build them, but the super collider relies on 
existing technology and may not lead to new breakthroughs. It will not be all 
that different from the Tevatron at Fermilab. But it will be a lot bigger, and 
thus far more powerful. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not An Atom Smasher 
</P>
<P>
The super collider is frequently referred to as an atom smasher, although that 
is not technically correct. The collider will produce head-on collisions of 
protons. Thus it is a particle accelerator, not an atom smasher, because it 
will not smash atoms. 
</P>
<P>
It will, however, tear protons to shreds. 
</P>
<P>
A magnetic field created by 10,000 magnets made of 60 million feet of 
superconducting copper cable will accelerate two beams of protons to nearly the 
speed of light in opposite directions around the 53-mile underground race 
track. The beams will cross six times, producing about 100 million collisions 
per second in each of six "interaction halls." The energy in each of those 
collisions will approach 40 trillion electron volts, 20 times greater than the 
highest energies available in any other collider in the world today. 
</P>
<P>
Each time two protons collide, the amount of energy transferred will be 
equivalent to the energy produced at that instant by all the power plants on 
Earth, concentrated in a region 100,000 times smaller than the diameter of a 
proton. 
</P>
<P>
Each collision will smash the protons, but it will not simply break them into 
pieces. At that energy, the collisions will create some new particles that have 
not existed since the birth of the universe. The process is similar to two 
trucks crashing into each other head-on and producing wreckage that includes a 
sports car, a motorcycle, two bicycles and a wide assortment of vehicles that 
no one had ever seen before. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Project's Only Purpose 
</P>
<P>
And that, essentially, is all that the largest pure science project ever 
envisaged will be designed to do. 
</P>
<P>
But to high-energy physicists, it will be a thing of great beauty. 
</P>
<P>
In a time so brief that it is to a second what a second is to 100,000 times the 
age of the universe, scientists will be able to observe what the universe was 
like at "the moment of creation," as it is so often referred to in technical 
literature. At that time, particle physicists like to point out, there was only 
particle physics. 
</P>
<P>
The effort to re-create the beginning of time is considered an arrogant goal by 
some scientists, but to others is pure science, a quest for nothing more than 
understanding. 
</P>
<P>
It is a quest that some scientists fear the nation may be forfeiting to others. 
</P>
<P>
Later this year, Fermilab's Tevatron will no longer be the world's most 
powerful collider. That mantle will go instead to the European high-energy 
physics center near Geneva, called Cern. 
</P>
<P>
The only way to regain that lead is to build the super collider, a project so 
costly that it has pitted scientist against scientist because of fears that it 
would drain funds away from less exotic but equally promising endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
"This project all along has not had an easy road," the Energy Department's 
Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Substantial Amount' 
</P>
<P>
"It's asking for a substantial amount of money," he added. "But it is the right 
answer for how to maintain our leadership in this field." Lederman, who 
admitted he is concerned that the super collider could siphon off funds from 
his own laboratory, has said repeatedly that the most important spinoff from 
the super collider could well be something that is very hard to put a price on. 
As a young man, he said, he became enchanted by a newspaper story about 
physicists who had traveled to a mountaintop to study radiation from space. 
</P>
<P>
Because of their efforts, he said, he decided to become a scientist. Last year 
he was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics. 
</P>
<P>
"The world's not going to end if we don't build the super collider," noted 
Louisiana's Hayes. But to turn back now, he added, would be to abandon a 
project that could entice thousands of youngsters into science and help assure 
the nation's technological viability in the years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
But today, the future of the super collider is as uncertain as its beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Alvin Trivelpiece, a former director of research for the Department of Energy 
who is now director of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, recalled the time 
former President Reagan was first briefed on the super collider, which is to be 
called the Ronald Reagan Center for High Energy Physics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Given No Assurances 
</P>
<P>
He said the President was told that there could be no assurance that the 
project would ever lead to practical rewards. 
</P>
<P>
"But it will make a lot of physicists happy," he recalled telling Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
The President said that seemed appropriate, since he had made his physics 
teachers very unhappy while he was a student, Trivelpiece said. 
</P>
<P>
Then the President "just got up and walked out of the room," Trivelpiece 
recalled. "He didn't say yes or no." 
</P>
<P>
But everyone in the room, he added, knew Reagan wanted to see the super 
collider built. 
</P>
<P>
And thus the project began, with neither a yes or no from the man whose name is 
supposed to one day adorn the most important high-energy physics laboratory in 
the world.

SAN DIEGO IRANIAN COMMUNITY FEARS RETRIBUTION

<P>
Members of San Diego's small Iranian community say they fear retribution for 
Friday's suspected terrorist bombing here. 
</P>
<P>
The fiery explosion destroyed a van driven by the wife of Capt. Will Rogers 
III, who directed the July, 1988, missile attack that mistakenly downed an 
Iranian jetliner in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's bombing, which left Sharon Rogers uninjured, has stirred speculation 
that the attack was to avenge the deaths of the 290 people aboard the civilian 
jetliner. The attack is under investigation by federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"People blame us for everything the Ayatollah (Khomeini of Iran) does, from 
book-burnings to hijackings," said Sara Ahamadianfard, who came to the United 
States in 1975 with her husband, a student at United States International 
University here. 
</P>
<P>
"So it won't surprise me if people assume Iranians had something to do with 
this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Adeeb Nozar Ahmadi, who works at a San Diego grocery store, said he worries 
that someone angered by the van bombing might take out their frustration on him 
or his young son. 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell when some people come into the store that they don't think I 
deserve to be here, that I am somehow a terrorist because of the actions of 
people I don't even know," he said.

'BANDIT' LIMOS DRIVING LEGITIMATE FIRMS TO RUIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was one of those glittering entertainment industry evenings. A fleet of 
sleek stretch limousines fanned out around town, scooping up Cher, Bobby 
McFerrin, kitsch horror queen Elvira and others to fetch them to the 1988 MTV 
Video Music Awards show last September. 
</P>
<P>
Reclining in the plush splendor of their chauffeur-driven coaches, the stars 
were unaware that the limousine company hired for the occasion was a renegade 
firm operating outside the law -- although one of the celebrities did complain 
after arriving at Universal Amphitheatre that her driver had made sexual 
overtures. 
</P>
<P>
The rich and famous, as well as the couple down the street, have been 
victimized by price-slashing "bandit" limousine companies. Legitimate operators 
say that the bandits are driving them out of business, and that state 
regulators are failing to control them. 
</P>
<P>
Operating potentially unsafe vehicles without proper licenses and insurance, 
the renegades have been involved in hit-and-run accidents and prostitution. 
Some have offered "prom night specials" of drugs to high school students. 
Studies in Sacramento and Los Angeles have shown that more than half of the 
advertisers in the local Yellow Pages are "bandit" companies, often operating 
on a shoestring out of storefronts or private homes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tantamount to an unlicensed industry when statistics show over 50% in 
L.A. are unlicensed," said Sue Frauens, supervisor of the consumer protection 
branch of the Los Angeles city attorney's office, which has filed suits against 
three of the companies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Most Serious of All' 
</P>
<P>
The state Public Utilities Commission, which regulates the industry, has found 
problems with renegade operators in Sacramento, Modesto, San Diego, Orange 
County and Palm Springs. But Los Angeles County, with its affluent 
neighborhoods in Beverly Hills and the San Fernando Valley, "is the most 
serious of all," said Larry McNeely, a PUC enforcement official. 
</P>
<P>
State law requires limousine operators to have at least $750,000 in public 
liability insurance on each vehicle and to obtain an operating license from the 
PUC, which takes 1% of the gross revenues as a fee. Experts in the field say 
these bills can add up to more than $20,000 a year for the average 
"mom-and-pop" fleet of three limousines. 
</P>
<P>
Avoiding the insurance and PUC fees allows the bandits to undercut legitimate 
operators by $10 an hour or more, according to Alan Shanedling, vice president 
of the Limousine Owners Assn. of California, based in Lawndale. As a result, it 
has put pressure on the legitimate side of the industry, forcing some limousine 
companies to become "bandits" themselves, according to McNeely. "It's almost a 
cannibalistic" situation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some established operators say the PUC must shoulder some of the blame for the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
"The PUC takes our money and in return they are supposed to keep us from being 
harassed by local municipalities and to keep illegals off the street. But they 
don't have the manpower to do it," said Harold Berkman, president and owner of 
Music Express Inc., a respected limousine operator in Southern California 
specializing in the celebrity trade. 
</P>
<P>
According to investigators and industry experts, the problems with unlicensed 
firms are an unwanted side effect of the Gold Rush-like boom in the limousine 
industry in recent years. After the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, when 
some operators offered their cars for $1,500 a day, interest blossomed in the 
business as an investment. 
</P>
<P>
"For a couple of years, it was at the top of everyone's list of business 
opportunities," said Scott Fletcher, editor of Limousine and Chauffeur 
magazine. "Everyone jumped into it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Almost Nothing Down' 
</P>
<P>
Creative auto financing allows small businessmen with big dreams to get into 
the driver's seat. A buyer can drive off the lot in a $50,000 vehicle with 
"almost nothing down," Shanedling said. 
</P>
<P>
McNeely estimated that there are now 2,000 licensed firms in California, up 
from about 900 five years ago, adding that "there has been tremendous growth in 
the 'bandit' side of it." 
</P>
<P>
While there are no statistics on it, unregulated firms are having a serious 
impact on legitimate operators. Betty Lewis of Highland, near San Bernardino, 
opened Lewis Limos in 1987 with two Lincoln stretch vehicles but shut down last 
December after losing $100,000 in a single year of operation. "You can't 
compete with people running for $20 an hour when you're charging $50," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher, the trade magazine editor, said a recent survey found that the 
average hourly limousine rate around the country is $48, compared to $40 an 
hour in Los Angeles. The difference, he said, is the depressing effect on 
prices of the "bandits" in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
PUC officials said that unregulated limousine companies have served as fronts 
for illegal activities. "We're fully aware they are involved in narcotics and 
prostitution," McNeely said. "During prom season, we heard more than once that 
companies would take you to the prom and you would get five lines of coke." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Delivered Cocaine 
</P>
<P>
A Monterey County drug dealer used his unlicensed limousine service to deliver 
cocaine, authorities said. After penetrating the operation, they discovered 
well-maintained "trip sheets" showing the destination of the drug shipments. 
</P>
<P>
Critics in the industry say the PUC has been slow in getting tough with the 
lawbreakers. McNeely agreed that the criticism "probably is correct. Several 
cases went by the wayside" in the past because of a shortage of enforcement 
officials. In August, 1987, however, the Legislature authorized the creation of 
the Passenger Compliance Unit in the PUC, with six new enforcement positions, 
to deal with the problem. McNeely, a former state Department of Justice 
official, was brought in to work more closely with local prosecutors around the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
The new approach has yielded results. At least 17 unlawful business practice 
lawsuits have been filed against unregulated limousine firms, including three 
in November by Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn. Judges have issued 
restraining orders to stop operations in some of the cases and ordered the 
seats removed from one company's limousines to make sure that the vehicles 
stayed off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
In two of the Los Angeles cases, the limousine operators' phone service was 
terminated -- a "unique prosecutorial tool," said Frauens of the city 
attorney's office. Lawsuits and restraining orders do not stop customers from 
scanning the Yellow Pages and calling the "bandits" for service, but cutting 
off the phones effectively shuts down the business. 
</P>
<P>
A January state auditor general's report indicated that the PUC still has its 
work cut out for it, however. The report said the agency had not followed up on 
nearly half -- 35 out of 74 -- of the cases against unlicensed operators. 
Further, seven of the companies involved in those cases were still doing 
business in December. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blatant Operators 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen this, where companies are blatantly operating in violation of 
the law," McNeely said. "They continue operating even when they know we're 
watching them, thumbing their noses at the investigating agency." 
</P>
<P>
In one of the Los Angeles cases, the operator of JJ&amp;T Limousines was 
accused of leaving high school students stranded on graduation night and of 
failing to return deposits. Sir Michael's Limousines Ltd., which has since 
obtained a license, was spotted at the Academy Awards show last year carrying a 
Los Angeles city councilman, according to a PUC investigator. Twenty-one other 
illegal operators carried clients attending the same Academy Awards show. 
</P>
<P>
Another Los Angeles suit was filed against Elegant Limousines Inc., which 
provided limousine service at the MTV awards show. Karen Sortito, an account 
director for the Western division of MTV Networks, said MTV paid Elegant 
$17,737 and promoted the limousine company in millions of American homes with a 
free, on-air advertisement. 
</P>
<P>
Although there were no accidents, Sortito said a celebrity complained "that one 
of the drivers was sexually suggestive to her." Sortito said she did not check 
the status of the company because "they were referred to me" by a co-worker. 
</P>
<P>
That was not the only problem involving Elegant. When the future Margery Pinedo 
met a limousine in Van Nuys to be taken to a San Gabriel church for her wedding 
last Sept. 3, she found a red-faced driver without a necktie who proceeded to 
lose his way, she said in an interview. Worse, the vehicle's air conditioner 
was out of order. With the temperature soaring, the interior got so hot that 
Pinedo's 3-year-old niece suffered a bloody nose. Pinedo's $900 wedding dress 
wilted. Refused a refund and a replacement car, the newlyweds finally 
discharged the limousine at the church, abandoning plans to ride to the 
reception in luxury, according to Pinedo. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bill Was $200 
</P>
<P>
The bill was over $200 for 45 minutes, Pinedo said. "We tried not to let it 
spoil the whole day." 
</P>
<P>
The PUC said passengers have been injured in accidents involving "bandit" 
companies. The agency is investigating two recent accidents in the Los Angeles 
area. In one, an Orange County "bandit" service carrying two passengers hit a 
parked car, then sped off. A wheel came off of another limousine operated by 
the same company and the limousine struck a car. 
</P>
<P>
The PUC is expected to file several cases against unregulated firms in Orange 
County within the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Legitimate companies, whose operators say the "bandits" are giving them a black 
eye, are applauding the PUC's stepped-up enforcement efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though only a few cases have been prosecuted, the word does spread and 
cleans up quite a few others," said Glenn Barrons, president of the Limousine 
Owners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Compare Prices 
</P>
<P>
While operators are supposed to list their PUC permit numbers in their 
advertisements, not all do. Also, some firms have been using phony numbers for 
several years. A simple rule of thumb for a person shopping for a limousine is 
to look at the price, industry experts say. If the company advertises a rate 
much lower than others, it might be wise to be suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
"Cheap is cheap," said Berkman of Music Express. "You can't give cheap and be 
legal."

WHITE S. AFRICA CHURCH CALLS APARTHEID 'A SIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa

<TEXT>
<P>
The white Dutch Reformed Church, the religious organization of President Pieter 
W. Botha and 95% of his Cabinet, has declared apartheid "a sin" and again 
confessed its guilt for having helped establish, maintain and justify racial 
segregation for nearly four decades. 
</P>
<P>
The action was considered a small advance for the 1.5-million member church. In 
1986, it had acknowledged that apartheid is a mistake, that the church's 
attempts to justify it biblically were wrong and that racism is a sin. 
</P>
<P>
The statement Friday signaled a renewed commitment among the white Calvinist 
church, to which 60% of the country's ruling Afrikaner people belong, to 
keeping its black, mixed-race Colored and Indian sister churches under the 
umbrella of the Dutch Reformed churches. 
</P>
<P>
Those sister churches, led by such notable anti-apartheid campaigners as the 
Rev. Allan Boesak, among others, had threatened to break their ties with the 
white church if it failed to take stronger stands against apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
But in a statement Friday, they said they forgave the white church for its 
historical role in supporting apartheid and, "well aware of our own weakness 
and sin, we do not intend to hold the past against them." 
</P>
<P>
Among the most contentious issues raised during a biennial meeting of the 
churches' leaders in Vereeniging last week was the role the churches should 
play in dismantling apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative members of the white church believe the church should stay out of 
politics. More liberal members of the other churches, including Boesak and the 
Rev. Beyers Naude, a white minister in the black sister church, believe in 
active resistance to apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
The black and mixed-race leaders said they had been heartened by the white 
church's "call for fundamental and comprehensive changes" in apartheid, but 
that whites must also "embark on acts of liberation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Differ on Civil Disobedience 
</P>
<P>
"One cannot be a Christian and not resist apartheid," the black and mixed-race 
leaders said. The white church refused to endorse a document issued by the 
sister churches that expressed support for civil disobedience. 
</P>
<P>
But the white church, in its statement, said it "clearly and unequivocally 
regards apartheid in all its forms (as) a sin and irreconcilable with the 
Gospel." It pledged itself to making the church family "one united, non-racial 
reformed church." Although the church body has been formally non-racial for 
several years, language differences and tradition have kept it divided into 
four racially separate churches. 
</P>
<P>
Apartheid "cannot be accepted on Christian ethical grounds, because it 
contravenes the very essence of reconciliation, neighborly love and 
righteousness," the white church said after the meeting, echoing the policy 
statement it issued in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The Dutch Reformed Churches have 3.2 million members, of whom 1.5 million are 
white, 1 million are black, 680,000 are mixed-race and 2,000 are Indian. The 
white flagship church's congregation includes nearly 40% of all white South 
Africans and an even larger share of the ruling National Party, which makes it 
an especially powerful force in a country where the black majority is denied a 
vote in national affairs. 
</P>
<P>
(Although President Botha is a member, the new leader of the National Party and 
Botha's apparent successor, Frederik W. de Klerk, belongs to a small Protestant 
denomination.) 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, the Dutch Reformed Church was the impetus for apartheid. In 1936, 
the church asked the government to prevent mixed marriages, and the government 
refused, saying that wasn't the job of the state. 
</P>
<P>
But 11 years later, the National Party came to power, ushering in apartheid and 
dozens of laws aimed at segregating the country, including legislation 
prohibiting racially mixed marriages, mixed neighborhoods, mixed schools, mixed 
meeting rooms and mixed hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
"We not only supported the concept of separateness, but we tried to give it a 
biblical, ethical justification," Johan Heyns, a theology professor and 
moderator of the white Dutch Reformed Church, told foreign journalists 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1986, the church rejected apartheid and decided to distance itself 
from politics, angering many of its members. About 30,000 far-right members and 
ministers broke away and formed a new church exclusively for white Afrikaners. 
</P>
<P>
"The task of the church is not to make specific suggestions to the government 
but to proclaim the demands of the kingdom of God and stress that the 
withholding of political rights is a serious affront to human dignity," Heyns 
said recently.

Representatives of 24 nations, gathered here at an environmental conference, 
called Saturday for increased authority in the United Nations to police the 
global atmosphere and for "appropriate measures" to enforce its directives. 
</P>
<P>
The appeal by leaders of 15 nations and ranking envoys from nine others marked 
the broadest and highest-level expression to date of political determination to 
take swift steps to organize worldwide protection of the Earth's threatened 
atmosphere, the officials declared. They called on "all states of the world" to 
endorse their work and join in negotiating the new U.N. authority and financing 
its operations. 
</P>
<P>
"People are aware, and they are worried," said Prime Minister Gro Harlem 
Brundtland of Norway, who organized the two-day conference along with Premier 
Michel Rocard of France and Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers of the Netherlands.

A DEAL WITH DALAI LAMA IS VIEWED AS CHINA'S BEST HOPE OF STABILIZING RESTIVE 
TIBET;

<TEXT>
<P>
For China, last week's pro-independence rioting and imposition of martial law 
in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa underscored the possibility that a deal with 
the exiled Dalai Lama may be the only solution to Beijing's intractable Tibet 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly 40 years, Tibetan resentment has smoldered since the Chinese assumed 
firm control of the region. There was harsh repression during the Cultural 
Revolution of 1966-76, but China's reformist leadership has tried in the last 
decade to assuage the Tibetans by allowing limited religious activity and 
promoting economic development. 
</P>
<P>
That policy is far from dead. But whatever luster it had was blackened last 
week in the bonfires of Lhasa, as rampaging youths ransacked Chinese-owned 
stores and burned their contents in the street. 
</P>
<P>
Police shot and killed at least 10 protesters last Sunday on the first day of 
the disturbances. Martial law was imposed at midnight Tuesday, and the death 
toll now stands at 16 by official count and 50 or more by unofficial Tibetan 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Tibetan nationalists can be expected to redouble their efforts to break free of 
Beijing's control, even as China intensifies its attempts to stabilize the 
region. Emotions on both sides were inflamed by last week's events, and 
continued conflict seems inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama, spiritual leader of the Tibetan people and former ruler of 
Tibet, remains the key to any solution that might satisfy both sides. It was 
his followers, Buddhist monks and nuns, who staged the pro-independence 
demonstration last Sunday that escalated into clashes with police. 
</P>
<P>
In a proposal put forth last June in Strasbourg, France, the Dalai Lama, 53, 
expressed willingness to return to Tibet in his religious capacity if the 
region were guaranteed autonomy and democracy. 
</P>
<P>
In explaining his willingness to compromise on the issue of full independence, 
the Dalai Lama has said he believes action must be taken relatively soon -- 
within 10 or 20 years -- to prevent the extinction of Tibetan religion, culture 
and language. 
</P>
<P>
As he knows well, the balance of strength between China and Tibet is heavily in 
Beijing's favor. China has far more firepower than it needs to crush any 
rebellion in the region, and no foreign power has indicated any interest in 
arming a Tibetan uprising. 
</P>
<P>
Tibet, which is slightly smaller than Alaska, has a population of 2 million, 
and there are about 4 million ethnic Tibetans elsewhere in China. 
</P>
<P>
Active resistance known to the outside world involves fewer than 1,000 
Lhasa-area Buddhist monks and nuns, as well as the residents of the Tibetan 
quarter of Lhasa, an area of roughly one square mile. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their efforts, it is highly unlikely that any Chinese government would 
allow Tibet to become independent, given its perceived strategic value and the 
belief of virtually all ethnic Chinese that the region is legitimately a part 
of China. 
</P>
<P>
Advocacy of independence is illegal, and protesters or rioters are treated as 
traitors and criminals. Western human rights organizations repeatedly have 
reported allegations of torture in Tibetan prisons. 
</P>
<P>
Still, if enough concessions could be granted to the Dalai Lama to persuade him 
to assume a pacifying, intermediary role, Tibet could be stabilized as a 
culturally distinct region of China. The much less influential Panchen Lama, 
Tibetan Buddhism's second-ranking leader, had tried to play that role until his 
death in January. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last six months, representatives of China and the Dalai Lama have 
engaged in delicate contacts aimed at opening negotiations. But now there is 
little room for compromise. Many of the Dalai Lama's fellow Tibetan refugees in 
India feel that his proposal already has given away too much. Beijing, for its 
part, dismisses his ideas as a disguised attempt to win independence. 
</P>
<P>
But even as the two sides exchanged angry words last week, neither ruled out 
the possibility of talks. Authorities in Lhasa have said martial law probably 
will be lifted by early April, with tourism likely to resume a few weeks later. 
The desire of officials in Beijing to keep the door open to the Dalai Lama, to 
minimize anti-Chinese resentment and to earn foreign exchange through tourism 
provides some constraints on their actions. 
</P>
<P>
Tibet was part of the Chinese empire during the Qing Dynasty, but held de facto 
independence for 40 years after 1911. Through a combination of military 
pressure and political negotiations, the Chinese Communists took control in 
1951 but did not immediately impose radical change. 
</P>
<P>
In the last three decades, however, the region has been transformed in many 
ways. Even so, there is a sense of deja vu in the current standoff, which marks 
the 30th anniversary of a much greater uprising on March 10, 1959, that 
resulted in the Dalai Lama's flight to India. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese crushed the revolt, then launched the so-called democratic reforms, 
stripping the great monasteries, landlords and old elite of their land and 
power. Some religious centers were razed, and in the early years of the 
Cultural Revolution, all but a few monasteries were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
These changes were supposed to raise the status of poor peasants, and to some 
extent they did. But there was great loss of life, and Tibetan culture suffered 
a devastating blow. 
</P>
<P>
After religious life resumed in the early 1980s and Tibet was opened to 
tourists, it appeared that the bitter wounds of the past might slowly heal. But 
since Oct. 1, 1987, four major protests have broken out in Lhasa, each 
suppressed by police gunfire. Total deaths in the first three incidents 
numbered between 15 and 40. 
</P>
<P>
Now, after last week's even more serious rioting, Chinese troops are marking 
the 30th anniversary of the original revolt by again patrolling the streets of 
Lhasa, using martial law to suppress a population that has lost none of its 
adoration for the Dalai Lama. 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of an agreement with the Dalai Lama, China has few options but 
to continue with the basic outlines of its present policies: repression of 
independence activists, matched with attempts to appease Tibetan sentiments by 
promoting the economy and Buddhism. 
</P>
<P>
Repression can and probably will be stepped up, with reports by Tibetans in 
Lhasa last week that as many as 1,000 people already had been detained. 
Nationalistic monks may be harshly treated, but it seems unlikely that Beijing 
will again close the monasteries and wage all-out war on religious life. 
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, some Western diplomats and other analysts believe that the trouble 
in Tibet strengthens hard-line Communist Party members critical of General 
Secretary Zhao Ziyang and his political allies, who have promoted the 
relaxation of ideological and social controls in China. 
</P>
<P>
But even Zhao, widely viewed as China's leading proponent of market-oriented 
economic reforms, takes a hard line toward independence activities in Tibet. On 
this point, the ruling Politburo, the military and ethnic Chinese throughout 
China are united. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, some analysts argue, it actually strengthens the hand of reformers in 
Beijing to be able to show toughness by cracking down on unruly Tibetans -- and 
such measures also may serve to warn any unhappy Chinese who might think of 
getting out of hand.

IRAN REGIME APPEARS BENT ON DELIBERATELY CUTTING ITSELF OFF FROM WESTERN 
NATIONS

<P>
Iran continues to deliberately cut itself off from Western nations as a result 
of the furor over Salman Rushdie's controversial novel, "The Satanic Verses," 
Middle East analysts said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
And the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's supreme leader and spiritual guide, 
will continue to press for the imposition of his religious views on the Muslim 
world at a high-level Islamic meeting in Saudi Arabia this week, according to 
specialists here. 
</P>
<P>
In Tehran, the hard-line newspaper Kayhan International said Saturday that the 
nation's move toward reconciliation with the West after last August's 
cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq War was "a very hasty and ill-planned strategy." 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, which currently reflects the tough Khomeini views, declared that 
rapprochement between Iran and the West was "a doomed effort." 
</P>
<P>
Western government support for the free-speech rights of Rushdie, whose book 
offended most followers of Islam and infuriated Muslim fundamentalists, showed 
that the attempt to better relations with West has been a failure, Kayhan said. 
</P>
<P>
"Iran is painting itself into a difficult diplomatic corner," observed one 
Middle Eastern specialist here. "This anti-Western behavior may delay 
indefinitely the country's economic recovery from the effects of the (Persian) 
Gulf War." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
45-Nation Conference 
</P>
<P>
Kayhan's negative view of Iranian ties with the West came on the eve of a 
four-day, 45-nation meeting of the Organization of the Islamic Conference in 
Riyadh, the Saudi Arabian capital, which formally begins Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati is expected to seek the meeting's 
condemnation of the West for publishing the book as well as its support for 
Khomeini's call that Rushdie be killed for having written it. 
</P>
<P>
But the ayatollah's extremist views -- and his yearning to become the leader of 
all Islam -- are expected to be resisted by Sunni Muslim leaders of nations 
rejecting Iran's brand of ultraconservative Islam. 
</P>
<P>
While other Islamic countries have condemned "The Satanic Verses" -- which 
pokes fun at the Prophet Mohammed, his wives and the writing of the Koran, the 
Muslim holy book -- they have not endorsed Khomeini's call for Rushdie's death. 
</P>
<P>
Further, many Muslim countries believe that it would be nonsense to cut off 
ties with major Western economic powers merely because of a privately written 
book, no matter how offensive. 
</P>
<P>
Iran broke diplomatic ties with Britain on March 7 because of London's refusal 
to ban the novel by Rushdie, a British citizen who was born a Muslim in Bombay, 
India. 
</P>
<P>
Iran is also threatening to sever relations with West Germany, which is 
Tehran's largest non-oil trading partner. 
</P>
<P>
West German politicians have called for economic sanctions against Iran unless 
Khomeini rescinds his clerics' offer of a $5.2-million "bounty" for anyone who 
kills Rushdie. 
</P>
<P>
Bonn has stopped talks on a $1.7-billion-$2.7-billion loan to Iran because of 
Iran's actions over "The Satanic Verses." 
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely stupid for Iran to impair relations with West Germany, with 
which it had good relations," one analyst here said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are shooting themselves in the foot if they go through with this threat. 
It is all simply to bolster the old ayatollah's dreams of Islamic glory and 
leadership." 
</P>
<P>
Iran has threatened to break ties with the rest of the European Community, as 
well as with Canada, Sweden and Norway, all of which withdrew their ambassadors 
to Tehran after Khomeini's threat against Rushdie. 
</P>
<P>
The Kayhan daily, Iran's largest newspaper, admitted Saturday that the 
breakdown of relations with European countries will harm Iran. But it argued 
that a rupture "will also give our policy-makers a new opportunity to 
re-evaluate and weigh their practical actions." 
</P>
<P>
"Iran is determined to safeguard its Islamic values even if it means a new 
round of political confrontation with anti-Islamic forces," the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
"With all these realities and the West's unlimited support for the Iraqi regime 
in the (Iran-Iraq) war, the Islamic Republic is not in a position to afford the 
luxury of friendly relations with the West." 
</P>
<P>
However, Middle East experts declared that the contrary is true: After its 
defeat in the Persian Gulf War, Iran is in no position to scorn the benefits of 
good ties with the West. 
</P>
<P>
But Khomeini is determined not only to shore up his position inside Iran, 
diplomatic analysts say, but to become the recognized leader of the entire 
Islamic world -- and he sees the Rushdie affair as the opportunity to project 
himself as such. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Shiite branch of Islam, of which Khomeini is leader, makes up only 
10% of the estimated 1 billion Muslims who are concentrated in a wide swath of 
nations stretching from Morocco to Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
And many Muslim nations -- Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Turkey and Malaysia, among 
others -- are far more secular in political outlook than the conservative 
Persian Gulf nations, with their fundamentalist Sunni and Shiite populations. 
</P>
<P>
So these countries are expected to resist Iran's demands at the Riyadh 
conference to further politicize the Rushdie issue. 
</P>
<P>
These leaders, diplomats say, believe that Khomeini wants to advance himself as 
the leader of the Islamic world as a way of strengthening his position in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
As Ahmed Abdel Ghani, managing editor of Bahrain's Akbar al Khaleej newspaper, 
put it: "Rushdie's book is rubbish. As such, the book does not justify the 
cantankerous uproar in Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
"But the Iranians obviously are out for political auctioneering and 
brinkmanship. The Iranians hope to become leaders of the world's Muslims and 
force the West to back down on the Rushdie issue." 
</P>
<P>
In Iran on Saturday, another newspaper, the Tehran Times, urged the West to 
consider a compromise proposal made Friday by Parliament Speaker Hashemi 
Rafsanjani that the Rushdie crisis could "be solved if Western nations burned 
all copies of 'The Satanic Verses.' 
</P>
<P>
"The West and supporters of the book should consider Mr. Rafsanjani's words 
carefully, coolly and objectively," said the paper. 
</P>
<P>
But it added that Khomeini's death threat "will remain valid while its cause 
exists."

CHENEY, NUNN AT ODDS OVER MILITARY'S DRUG ROLE

President Bush's new nominee for defense secretary, Rep. Dick Cheney (R-Wyo.), 
has in the past supported a plan strongly opposed by the Pentagon that would 
require the U.S. military to halt drug smuggling over the nation's southern 
border. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney's vote for the proposal, which was approved by the House last May 5 over 
the opposition of then-Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and was later 
weakened in the Senate, is one of many defense-related issues on which he 
surely will be quizzed during confirmation hearings by the Senate Armed 
Services Committee, beginning this week. 
</P>
<P>
A review by The Times of Cheney's House votes and statements on defense issues 
found that while he consistently backed the Ronald Reagan Administration's 
military buildup over the last eight years, few of the positions he took as a 
House member would clash with the majority opinion on the Democratic-controlled 
Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One Vote Most at Odds 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the one Pentagon-related vote by Cheney over the last year that 
conflicts most sharply with the views of Armed Services Committee members is 
the one he cast for a GOP-inspired amendment ordering the secretary of defense 
to "substantially halt the unlawful penetration of United States borders by 
aircraft and vessels carrying narcotics within 45 days of enactment." 
</P>
<P>
The House-passed drug interdiction proposal was strongly opposed not only by 
Carlucci but also by Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), who a 
year earlier had entertained spectators in the Senate gallery by ridiculing the 
idea in the starkest terms possible -- detailing the enormous quantities of 
military personnel and equipment that would have to be diverted from normal 
duties to halt drug trafficking across U.S. borders. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn, in negotiations last May with Carlucci and Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.), 
the committee's ranking Republican, eventually came up with a compromise 
acceptable to the House leadership that increased the Defense Department's role 
in drug interdiction, but only marginally. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Glenn Criticizes Posturing 
</P>
<P>
On the Senate floor, Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio), a member of the Armed Services 
Committee, criticized both the House-passed amendment and the Senate compromise 
as nothing more than political posturing in a year that many members of 
Congress were facing reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Williams, House press secretary for Cheney, said Saturday he does not know 
if the nominee still supports the anti-drug plan that he voted for last year or 
whether he would press for an increased military role in drug interdiction as 
defense secretary. 
</P>
<P>
In response to such questions, Williams quoted Cheney as saying on Saturday: 
"With respect to my votes and positions during my years in Congress, I have 
said I would not discuss policy prior to my appearance before the Congress." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, who was nominated Friday only one day after the Senate rejected Bush's 
first nominee, John Tower, spent the weekend poring through briefing papers 
provided by the Administration on defense issues likely to be raised in 
confirmation hearings by the Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Date Set for Hearing 
</P>
<P>
No date has yet been announced for the start of Cheney's confirmation hearings, 
but Williams said the nominee expects them to begin as early as Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In the hearings, Cheney is likely to be questioned about his prolific public 
statements and writings defending the prerogatives of the executive branch as 
well has his many votes on defense-related issues in the House. 
</P>
<P>
Just last year, Cheney voted in favor of spending nearly $5 billion on Reagan's 
"Star Wars" nuclear defense system, $650 million to deploy the MX missile on 
railroad cars and $350 million for the small intercontinental ballistic missile 
known as Midgetman. He also was a staunch advocate of aid to the Nicaraguan 
resistance and an outspoken foe of a proposal that would require the President 
to inform Congress of all covert actions within 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Many Democratic members of the Armed Services Committee, as well as at least 
one Republican, Sen. William S. Cohen (R-Me.), are on record favoring the 
48-hour provision, which passed the Senate last year but was never brought up 
for a vote in the House. Cheney's opposition to it is consistent with his 
often-expressed view that Congress imposes too many constraints on the 
President. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Favors Discretion 
</P>
<P>
Cheney has argued that the 48-hour rule is part of a "never-again" philosophy 
adopted by many members of Congress in the wake of the Iran-Contra affair. He 
has described it as "fatally flawed" because it would "deprive future 
presidents of all possible discretion under conditions Congress cannot possibly 
foresee." 
</P>
<P>
As a member of the Iran-Contra investigating committee, Cheney generally 
defended the Reagan Administration while acknowledging that mistakes were made 
by Reagan. A former White House chief of staff during the Gerald R. Ford 
Administration, he said he was not troubled by Lt. Col. Oliver L. North's 
shredding of documents because all top officials destroyed sensitive documents. 
</P>
<P>
Although the issue of Cheney's support for Contra aid will probably be explored 
by the Armed Services Committee, it may not be dwelt upon in the hearings since 
the President has indicated that he has no plans to revive military assistance 
in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
On "Star Wars,"the Strategic Defense Initiative, Cheney voted last year for an 
unsuccessful amendment to increase spending for development of the system to 
$4.9 billion in the current fiscal year -- only $400 million more than was 
authorized by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposes Funds Limit 
</P>
<P>
But he opposed a successful amendment by Rep. John M. Spratt Jr. (D-S.C.) 
specifying that no more than 40% of the funds authorized for SDI could be used 
to develop a so-called "phase one," using existing technology, for deployment 
as early as the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney also supported a defeated proposal authored by then-Rep. Jack Kemp 
(R-N.Y.) to require the Pentagon to map out a plan for developing an accidental 
launch protection system that would include two ground-based anti-missile sites 
as well as space-based components. While no similar plan was offered in the 
Senate, Nunn has recently advocated redirecting SDI research to produce a 
system to guard against accidental launch. 
</P>
<P>
One major issue facing Cheney as defense secretary is to allocate current 
funding between the MX rail garrison system supported strongly by conservative 
Republicans and the Midgetman favored by liberal Democrats. On this issue, his 
voting record provides no clear indication how he would settle the issue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Supports MX Funding 
</P>
<P>
While Cheney voted last year against a proposal by Rep. John G. Rowland 
(R-Conn.) to eliminate funding for the Midgetman, he nonetheless did support an 
amendment by Rep. William L. Dickinson (R-Ala.) intended to increase MX funding 
at the expense of the Midgetman program. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Cheney was quoted as accusing liberals of favoring Midgetman only 
as a part of a strategy to block deployment of any new strategic weapons. "Some 
of our colleagues never support the deployment of any additional capability on 
the grounds that there will always be something better in the future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After voting for many of these amendments, Cheney last year voted against the 
overall House legislation authorizing $299.5 billion for the Pentagon during 
the current fiscal year. He offered no explanation for his vote.

Two senators predicted Saturday that the Senate would easily approve President 
Bush's new choice for defense secretary, Rep. Dick Cheney (R-Wyo.), but they 
did not expect a vote on the nomination this week. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking on CNN's "Newsmaker Saturday," Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and 
Malcolm Wallop (R-Wyo.) agreed that Cheney had adequate experience for the job. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it may be helpful to have somebody go in that doesn't think he has all 
of the answers, but Dick Cheney has had a lot of experience in matters relating 
directly to national defense," Cranston said. "Dick has a great deal more 
experience with defense matters than has been the general cast of reports about 
him," Wallop said.

CONFEREES DEBATE STRATEGY TO REGAIN WHITE HOUSE;

At first glance, Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown's advice to party 
leaders to put increased emphasis on the West and South in trying to reverse 
the Democrats' long presidential slump might have seemed unremarkable. 
</P>
<P>
But the context of his comments, offered here Saturday at the conclusion of a 
two-day conference on Democratic issues and strategy, could have considerable 
bearing on the party's future. Brown, the Democrats' first black chairman, has 
long been closely linked to the party's traditional liberal base in the North 
and industrial Midwest, while the conference was sponsored by the Democratic 
Leadership Council, a group of moderate-to-conservative officeholders. 
</P>
<P>
So Brown's suggestion that Democrats need to broaden their horizons served as 
striking reinforcement for the notion that dominated the meeting: the 
Democratic need to regain support among middle-class Americans if they are to 
have a fighting chance to regain the presidency in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Urges New Road Map 
</P>
<P>
"We have our work cut out for us," said Brown, whose battle stripes include 
service in the Edward M. Kennedy and Jesse Jackson presidential campaigns. "We 
need to chart a road map to the presidency, a road that gives new emphasis to 
the South and the West." 
</P>
<P>
By his remarks here and his very attendance from start almost to finish at this 
centrist function, Brown appeared to be subscribing, at least in general terms, 
to the diagnosis of the party's strategic malady held by such conservatives as 
Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn, the DLC chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn, calling on the nearly 80 elected officials present to take "an 
unflinching look" at the Democratic predicament, declared in his keynote speech 
Friday: "Democratic support is hemorrhaging in the heart of the electorate. We 
are losing the working- and middle-class Americans who used to be the mainstay 
of our party's coalition." 
</P>
<P>
No one here argued that the Democrats should turn their backs on low-income 
voters, blacks and minorities who make up their most dependable supporters. And 
some party leaders, such as House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, stressed the 
need for Democrats to maintain their base even as they reach out. 
</P>
<P>
"To make a choice between the interest of median-income Americans and those of 
the less fortunate who want only to scale the ladder to join the median-income 
ranks would be an act of self-defeating folly," Wright declared. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees Necessary Choice 
</P>
<P>
But Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the 1988 Democratic vice presidential nominee, 
conceded that at times the Democrats might have to choose between appealing to 
these two groups. 
</P>
<P>
"Where the two conflict, as they sometimes do, I feel we have to reach out" 
Bentsen said. "When you've decided your house is too small, it's all very well 
to do some shoring up and strengthening of the foundation. But at some point 
you've got to build where nothing existed before." 
</P>
<P>
As might be expected, this sort of talk did not sit well with one conference 
participant, heavily dependent for support on the Democratic base -- Jackson. 
He argued that Democrats could improve their presidential performance by 
increasing the turnout of their regular supporters, a tactic which he 
complained 1988 nominee Michael S. Dukakis failed to pursue vigorously enough. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost 10 states with 160 (electoral) votes by less than the margin of 
unregistered African-American voters in those states alone," Jackson argued. 
The Democrats will be better served, he claimed if they focus on the concerns 
of their hard-core constituents. 
</P>
<P>
"What counts the most," Jackson said, "is not who leads us, but who needs us." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scorns Suggestion 
</P>
<P>
He was scornful of suggestions that Democrats try to broaden their appeal. "We 
have to determine which side of history we are on," Jackson told reporters 
between conference sessions. "If we are all things to all people, we become 
rather ill-defined, indecisive. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The argument that Democrats should remain true to their old- fashioned brand of 
two-fisted liberalism was also advanced by Rep. Richard A. Gephardt. A DLC 
founder and 1988 presidential candidate, who like Jackson, is expected by many 
Democrats to try again in 1992, Gephardt invoked the memory of his fellow 
Missourian, Harry S. Truman. 
</P>
<P>
As the Democratic standard-bearer in 1948, Gephardt recalled, Truman depicted 
the Republicans as arch-reactionaries, "silent and cunning men who would skim 
the cream from our natural resources to satisfy their own greed." Underdog 
Truman won a stunning upset victory. 
</P>
<P>
"People say populism and saying where you stand doesn't work any more," 
Gephardt said. "I think it does."

WALL ST. JOURNAL EDITORIALS INSPIRE, ANGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Amid revolution, one thing at the Wall Street Journal is unchanged: The 
independent nation-state of conservative Robert Bartley -- the editorial pages. 
</P>
<P>
Bartley's pages -- strident, gutsy, infuriating or inspirational (depending on 
one's philosophy) -- operate something like a naughty smart kid in school, 
pestering conservatives not to yield and seeking to humble liberals at every 
turn. 
</P>
<P>
"By far the best editorial page . . . in the world," said Commentary Editor 
Norman Podhoretz, fittingly unequivocal. 
</P>
<P>
"They have Stalinist tendencies that the end justifies the means -- a kind of 
intellectual dishonesty," said New Republic Editor Michael Kinsley, once the 
page's token liberal columnist. "You can use that if you say I'm also very 
grateful that they always allowed me to write whatever I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
However, both sides generally agree with Time magazine columnist Charles 
Krauthammer: Bartley's editorial section "is extraordinarily entertaining and 
informative, which is fairly unusual for an editorial page." 
</P>
<P>
In an era when most editorial pages try to instruct readers through arguments 
that, above all, are reasoned and moderate, the Journal is deliberately 
provocative. 
</P>
<P>
Bartley said the difference "is a matter of tactics rather than purposes. We 
want to be participants in the debates of our age and not, like Puck, standing 
above them, saying: 'What fools these mortals be!' " 
</P>
<P>
The Journal participated especially in the rise of supply-side economics, which 
began as an untested notion scrawled on a napkin by economist Arthur B. Laffer 
during dinner with a Journal editorial writer and soon became a national 
crusade. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, the Journal has championed open immigration policies and freer 
use of experimental drugs for terminally ill patients, positions consistent 
with its free-market world view. 
</P>
<P>
And often, on political matters, Bartley and his crew seem to relish the role 
of ideological kamikaze -- the first to jump the trench and charge. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent case is Bartley's controversial decision to reprint last month 
a 17-year-old story from the Atlanta Constitution reporting that Georgia 
Democrat Sam Nunn, now Senate Armed Services Committee chairman and leading 
opponent of John Tower's nomination as secretary of defense, had been involved 
in a drunk-driving incident and paid a fine for leaving the scene of an 
accident. Nunn was 26 at the time. 
</P>
<P>
The Tower debate had taken on "a rather hypocritical and take-no-prisoners 
partisan" tone, Bartley explained, "but the bottom line is here we spent a lot 
of time discussing the merits of it and finally said (that) maybe we should 
share this argument with the public." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, when George Bush's campaign operatives were peddling unsubstantiated 
rumors that Michael S. Dukakis had suffered psychological problems, Bartley's 
pages printed the rumors in an editorial criticizing Dukakis for not releasing 
his medical records. It even suggested that there might be a "family history" 
of mental instability because Dukakis' brother had had a mental breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
"What we ran was factual," Bartley said. 
</P>
<P>
And, in 1984, Bartley ran an article about Geraldine A. Ferraro and the Mafia 
that editors had rejected for the news columns. 
</P>
<P>
The article could find no link between Ferraro and the mob and even indicated 
that her husband had tried to keep his distance from it. But it outlined a 
connection that her father-in-law, Philip Zaccaro, reputedly had. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess, in retrospect, there are times that I had wished I had bucked that 
story back to them for more reporting," Bartley said. 
</P>
<P>
The motive in those cases, in part, is what Bartley sees as a pack mentality in 
the press that unconsciously skews to the left. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a unified mind-set," he said, not "a conscious effort to influence the 
news," but "I think that, de facto, there is a greater tendency to go after the 
conservatives. . . . And I guess we have counterbalanced that some with these 
political stories."

NAVY PREGNANCIES: ARE THEY ROCKING THE BOAT?; 
</P>
<P>
STUDY LOOKING AT WHETHER MOTHERHOOD IS COMPATIBLE WITH READINESS FOR WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
At any given time during the past year, about 8.5% of the women in the Navy 
were pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
A benign statistic on the surface, that recently calculated number has 
disturbed Navy officials at commands around the world, fueled the grumblings of 
male sailors at the lower ranks and emerged as an issue that could curtail the 
dramatic opening of opportunities for women in the Navy that began more than a 
decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The shipboard environment is a very environmentally unsafe atmosphere," said 
Capt. Kathleen Bruyere, special assistant to the chief of naval personnel for 
women's policy. "You have to worry about toxins and stress and movement and 
that sort of thing. That's why we don't let them stay there for the entire 
pregnancy. . . . Our No. 1 concern is and will be the health and well-being of 
the mother and the fetus." 
</P>
<P>
The Navy, almost exclusively the domain of men until the mid-1970s, has no 
mechanism to compensate for a significant number of unanticipated leaves due to 
pregnancy. Today, with enlisted women numbering 49,086, and 7,477 women 
officers, the Navy is nearly 10% female. 
</P>
<P>
With the percentage of women increasing each year, Navy officials are taking a 
serious look at whether pregnancy among sailors and officers has an effect on 
the service's readiness to respond in a crisis or time of war. Navy researchers 
in San Diego are about seven months into a three-year study of the question. 
</P>
<P>
"Is there an effect of pregnancy -- in whatever numbers it comes out to be -- 
on readiness in the United States Navy? Are we having a problem accomplishing 
our mission because of this medical condition and whatever lost time is 
attributed to it?" Bruyere asked. "We were absolutely not able to make any 
conclusions because there was no data, it was inconclusive and comments were 
anecdotal." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commissioned a Study 
</P>
<P>
According to a Navy report released a year ago, "Navy leaders view pregnancy 
and its effects on personnel turnover and lost time as a major consideration in 
decisions concerning employment of women in the Navy." However, the report 
says, there was no data with which to assess the impact on the Navy, and a 
study was commissioned. 
</P>
<P>
The 8.5% pregnancy rate finding is an early result of the study, which also 
found that 40% of the pregnancies were unplanned and 37% of the pregnant 
sailors were unmarried. The number of pregnancies among unmarried Navy women is 
about the same as the percentage in the general population, but the figure is 
particularly troublesome for a military service that demands that its members 
put in long and unpredictable hours while on shore and go to sea for six months 
at a time. 
</P>
<P>
Once the study is concluded, the Navy will consider whether to make policy 
changes to ameliorate the effects of the increase of women in its ranks. Navy 
officials will not speculate publicly on 
</P>
<P>
what those changes might be. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen years ago, a Navy woman who became pregnant was automatically 
discharged. Under current Navy policy, a woman may not embark on a cruise if 
she is pregnant at the time her ship is deployed. If a woman becomes pregnant 
while at sea, she may stay aboard the ship only until the 20th week of 
pregnancy. However, she may leave earlier if her medical condition warrants it 
or if she opts to resign from the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly having to lose a valuable, contributing support person who is part of 
your team . . . is a matter of great concern to any manager or leader, whether 
you are ashore or on shipboard," Bruyere said. "On shipboard, that's of even 
more concern, because that person has to go away." 
</P>
<P>
Cmdr. Judy J. Glenn, a Navy nurse in the obstetrics and gynecology department 
at the Navy Hospital in Balboa Park was the first researcher to call attention 
to the pregnancy issue. During a 10-month period in 1986 and 1987, Glenn found 
that out of the 789 Navy women on active duty who registered for prenatal care 
at the hospital, 41% were single. 
</P>
<P>
Single parents are a growing population in the Navy and society in general, 
Glenn said. With 52% of the women in her study under 22 years old, many had 
unrealistically optimistic expectations about caring for a child while 
remaining in the Navy, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not talking about mature, responsible adults. We're talking about very 
young adults," Glenn said. "They're 19 to 21, newly emancipated, sexually 
active and not using birth control." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, Glenn said, "reality doesn't set in" until long after the baby is 
born. 
</P>
<P>
"There's this feeling that the military takes care of its own," she said. "It 
gives you housing and medical care. Many people expect child care, too." The 
Navy, however, has neither the legal obligation nor the resources to provide 
child care for the millions of military dependents around the world. 
"Definitely, child care is one of the biggest issues we have," Glenn said. 
</P>
<P>
"In the civilian world, if you have a problem with your child, you would call 
in sick or you just wouldn't show up for work," Glenn said. That option is not 
available in military life, where a person who does not show up for work can be 
disciplined or court-martialed for being absent without leave. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of them are naive," she said. "They have no established household, no 
transportation." Many of the single women are living on shipboard or in 
bachelor enlisted quarters and have no furniture and few possessions. Faced 
with the expense of setting up a household in San Diego, they are overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
Often, the fathers take no responsibility for the children, she said. "The 
fathers of these babies are sailors," Glenn said. "I don't think we've taken a 
hard enough stance on that -- that they're personally and morally obligated." 
</P>
<P>
In response to the increasing need for specialized medical care for Navy women, 
Glenn helped organize the first active duty women's clinic in the Navy three 
years ago at the 32nd Street Naval Station. That clinic and five branches that 
have since opened in the San Diego area provide a range of services, including 
counseling on legal rights, paternity issues, child care and the practical 
problems of setting up a household. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic also answers questions from befuddled commanding officers who are 
unsure how to deal with pregnant women. "We get questions like, 'Can a pregnant 
woman mop the floor or can she be required to work on the second floor of a 
building where there's no elevator?' " Glenn said. Before the clinic was 
established, there were 17 health-care providers for active duty women in the 
San Diego area, many of them offering conflicting advice, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic also has developed an educational program aimed at young women who 
are not pregnant. "We're not specifically doing it to decrease the pregnancy 
rate, but to decrease the unplanned pregnancy rate," Glenn said. 
</P>
<P>
Even for those who plan a pregnancy, continued life in the Navy can be hard. 
Shannon Stromberg, 22, a petty officer 3rd class, is expecting her first child 
and has another 3 1/2 years to serve. She has decided to stay in the Navy, but 
is worried about the expense of child care and her unpredictable hours at the 
Navy Hospital, where she works as a physical therapist. Her husband, a 
civilian, works full time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Luckier Than Most 
</P>
<P>
She acknowledges that she is luckier than many of her friends in the Navy 
because her work specialty does not require her to go to sea. "I know women who 
have kids who have to go to sea for six months. I get upset at the idea of 
being away for the weekend. I can't imagine going away on a ship. . . . A lot 
of women come in (the Navy) and have no idea what they're getting into." 
</P>
<P>
Stromberg said she knows of instances in which women have intentionally become 
pregnant either to avoid sea duty or to get out of the Navy altogether. 
However, she said she believes the number of women who do that is decreasing 
because the Navy is expanding opportunities for women, thereby decreasing the 
career frustration that makes them want to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are no statistics on this question, many male sailors complain 
privately that women use pregnancy as an excuse to take coveted shore jobs and 
avoid the tiresome six-month deployments. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn's statistics indicate that 70% of women who become pregnant decide to 
stay in the Navy, even though they generally are entitled to leave. Many stay 
for economic reasons, she said. "Women who resign when they're pregnant have a 
very difficult time finding jobs in the San Diego job market." 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Barton, associate director of the Armed Services YMCA on West Broadway, 
said her office counsels about 315 pregnant Navy women each year through an 
agreement with Glenn's clinic. 
</P>
<P>
"We find women who are ambivalent about the pregnancy, who are not being 
supported by the father of the baby," Glenn said. "Maybe they're still living 
in barracks, the pregnancy was unplanned and she doesn't know what the heck 
she's going to do." 
</P>
<P>
The service helps the women set up a household, provides emergency loans and, 
in some cases, helps to arrange for adoptions. A big problem facing many young 
Navy women who lived on base is the lack of transportation in the civilian 
community. Most cannot afford to buy a car, she said. The YMCA sponsors a 
volunteer service to provide emergency transportation and rides to medical 
appointments. 
</P>
<P>
Still, not all the problems can be solved. 
</P>
<P>
"We actually have women who return from maternity leave and have to go on a 
six-month deployment," she said. "I've known women who have flown to Tennessee 
and left the baby with Mom for six months." 
</P>
<P>
A major problem facing new mothers in the Navy, single or married, is the lack 
of support from family and friends, she said. "She probably moved here from 
somewhere else, like most people in the Navy." 
</P>
<P>
The continuing Navy study, being conducted by Patricia J. Thomas, a 
psychologist at the Navy Personnel Research and Development Center in San 
Diego, will attempt to quantify the extent of the problem. She said she also 
plans to collect comparative data on Navy men on medical leave or out for 
reasons such as drug or legal problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the real heart of my findings to date has been that women in the Navy 
are a reflection of their own-age cohort in society," Thomas said. "What's 
happening is very reasonable. We should anticipate this sort of pregnancy rate 
going on, because that's what's normal." 
</P>
<P>
The question that will face Navy officials in the years to come is whether 
normal is acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
"Our pregnancy rate matches society," Glenn said, "but can we work with that?"

LAWMAKER'S DAUGHTER;

<P>
27 TICKETS AND 6 ACCIDENTS BEFORE SHE LOST LICENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
By the time Assemblywoman Cathie Wright's daughter was ordered off the roads 
last week, she had had 27 traffic tickets -- including 24 for speeding -- and 
at least six accidents, and was the subject of 10 hearings by the state 
Department of Motor Vehicles, public records show. 
</P>
<P>
Even the DMV official who reinstated Victoria Catherine Wright's license to 
drive to and from work in July, after it had been suspended the previous month, 
wrote: 
</P>
<P>
"This young lady's record is horrendous. Contacts in the past have had 
apparently little or no effect on her driving practices." 
</P>
<P>
This extraordinary driving record has become the subject of public scrutiny 
because Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury's office is 
investigating allegations that Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) improperly sought 
to use her political clout to help her daughter, 24, retain her license despite 
the mounting violations. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation is focusing on the lawmaker's intervention with Ventura 
County Municipal Court judges and the DMV and what investigators consider the 
unusual handling and outcome of some of the cases, sources say. Investigators 
are also reportedly looking into Wright's attempts to influence the Simi Valley 
police, who issued most of Victoria Wright's tickets. 
</P>
<P>
An extensive analysis by The Times of Victoria Wright's court and DMV records 
dating to 1981 turned up more convictions than had previously been reported in 
news accounts. It also found the following: 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Municipal Court Judge Bruce A. Clark dismissed two speeding 
tickets in May, 1988, in return for Victoria Wright's attendance at a traffic 
school -- even though she had been convicted of 12 moving violations in the 
previous three years. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, violators can use the traffic school option as often as the 
judges choose, but it is "the general rule of thumb" that most judges allow an 
offender to do so only once every 12 months, DMV spokeswoman Gina McGuiness 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Clark's decision followed a visit by Cathie Wright to his Ventura home, a 
sequence of events that Bradbury's investigators are reviewing, sources said. 
Citing the ongoing inquiry, Clark declined Friday to discuss his reported 
meeting with fellow Republican Wright or the reason for his actions. 
</P>
<P>
The two violations dismissed by Clark occurred a month after Judge Herbert 
Curtis III had placed Victoria Wright on probation for three years and given 
her a 30-day suspended sentence for driving without a license. He also fined 
her for two speeding convictions. Curtis told her that she would go to jail for 
her next conviction and indicated in the record that she should be brought back 
to his court for any future violations. 
</P>
<P>
That did not happen. For some reason, which authorities could not explain last 
week, Curtis' instructions and the fact that Wright was on probation were not 
included in the record that went to Clark. The omission occurred, authorities 
said, even though the two speeding convictions that Curtis had handled at the 
same time were in the record. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis said he learned of the subsequent convictions from a reporter this month 
and has scheduled Wright's arraignment for Tuesday on charges that she violated 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators are also looking into a phone call that Curtis, a Democrat, has 
reportedly told them he received from Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco) at Cathie Wright's behest. The judge said that Brown told him that 
Victoria Wright "was a good person trying to get her life in order and deserved 
a break in the case," said sources familiar with the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
As controversy raged last week over whether Victoria Wright was accorded 
special treatment, an anguished Cathie Wright maintained that she had tried to 
help her daughter as a concerned mother and responsive lawmaker and had done 
nothing improper. She has shielded her daughter from the press; Victoria Wright 
would not be interviewed for this story. 
</P>
<P>
Cathie Wright, meanwhile, asserted that fellow Republican Bradbury is acting 
out of spite because she went to the State Police rather than to his office or 
Simi Valley police about unrelated incidents involving her daughter. In 
addition, she and Speaker Brown have suggested that Bradbury is trying to 
destroy Wright's political career on behalf of rival GOP lawmakers in Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Others involved in the investigation have also said they did nothing wrong or 
declined to comment. DMV officials, for example, said that nothing improper was 
done for Victoria Wright, although James E. Dunn, a DMV traffic safety manager 
who reinstated her license on a restricted basis in July, acknowledged that the 
"sensitivity" of the matter led to his involvement. 
</P>
<P>
Brown denied calling Curtis but added, "even if I had, it wouldn't be 
improper." 
</P>
<P>
Victoria Wright's license was revoked Thursday. And with a possible jail 
sentence hanging over her, public attention has shifted toward the young woman 
herself, who is "very scared by all this and feels she's been pulled into 
something way beyond her capabilities to handle," according to one of her 
advisers. She is also said to fear losing her job as a cashier and clerk at a 
Thousand Oaks supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, questions are being raised about someone who would run up so many 
traffic violations, even after it was apparent that driving too fast was a 
recurrent problem. 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, Victoria Wright is a headstrong young woman who has also been 
plagued by troubles when she is not behind the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
"Vickie was a tough kid and hard to control," said one person long familiar 
with the family. As others did, the source requested anonymity. "Vickie's 
always had problems." 
</P>
<P>
Cathie Wright, 59, who has often been called stubborn and hard-nosed herself, 
has fought a rear-guard action for years to resolve her only child's troubles 
after the 1982 death of her husband, Victor Wright, political associates say. A 
blustery ex-state police trooper from Chicago, he worked as a printer in 
Burbank before he became seriously ill with emphysema and heart problems. 
</P>
<P>
Cathie Wright said she has worked hard to keep her daughter divorced from her 
public life, which friends say has become an all-consuming passion. The 
legislator lamented last week, "It's my job that's putting her through all 
this." 
</P>
<P>
Except for a semester at Cerritos Community College, Victoria Wright's formal 
education ended in August, 1981, with graduation from Apollo High School in 
Simi Valley, an alternative program for students considered at risk of dropping 
out of the conventional school system. Apollo emphasizes raising students' 
self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
Cathie Wright's political associates recall that she repeatedly expressed 
frustration at her inability to control her daughter's often reckless behavior 
and her choice of friends, particularly boyfriends. Most recently, Victoria 
Wright was involved for a year with Alan Wayne Keel, 33, a transient who is 
doing 60 days in the Ventura County Jail after pleading no contest to battery 
charges of grabbing her by the neck Jan. 27. 
</P>
<P>
Her mother is fiercely protective of Victoria, who she says is her only family. 
The two have clashed bitterly on occasion, others say. Mother and daughter 
share a modest three-bedroom home in a quiet middle-class neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
For the past eight years Cathie Wright has scrambled to juggle her roles as 
mother and assemblywoman. The post demands four days a week in Sacramento and 
many evenings and weekends attending political and community events in her 
sprawling 37th District, which includes parts of Los Angeles, Ventura and Kern 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
"Her father was ill for 10 years, and her mother lives in a political 
fishbowl," Wright said of Victoria recently. "You're darned right she's had 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
Wright, a former Simi Valley mayor, offered an explanation for the traffic 
violations last year. This included an oft-repeated assertion that her daughter 
has been the victim of harassment by the Simi Valley Police Department, which 
Simi Valley officials say is untrue. 
</P>
<P>
"Vickie has grown up believing that her last name could circumvent some of the 
problems that she's been involved in," Wright told a DMV hearing officer when 
she represented her daughter at a suspension hearing in June, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, my husband, who has passed away, instilled upon Vickie that she could 
use her last name to avoid citations. Unfortunately, Vickie believed this and 
drove accordingly. Now, the local law enforcements are citing Vickie for 
offenses whereby she's only traveling with the flow of traffic. Local law 
enforcements were upset with my deceased husband's attitude." 
</P>
<P>
With his gruff manner and deep, husky voice, Victor Wright was never shy about 
invoking his wife's political offices to badger Simi Valley officials to do 
things, said several individuals who knew him. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it is Assemblywoman Wright's contacts with Simi Valley police on 
her daughter's behalf that are now in question. Moreover, Victoria Wright 
seemed to bring at least some of her troubles on herself. 
</P>
<P>
At a DMV hearing in October, 1987, that resulted in her license being 
suspended, Victoria Wright "claimed most violations in the past were received 
in a high-powered Mustang to and from work," the report says. "Mustang had too 
much horsepower" so she replaced it. "However, last speed citation was received 
in a rental car." 
</P>
<P>
On two occasions, DMV records show, Victoria Wright received speeding tickets 
the day after she was involved in accidents. She now has a 1988 Toyota, DMV 
records show. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in any of her accidents, and she was never cited for any 
violations in the accidents, DMV records show. Also, she was never found to be 
driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Her driving history is not entirely clear from the DMV files because the agency 
does not necessarily keep complete records more than three years. Some 
incomplete records do exist, however, for previous years. 
</P>
<P>
The first time the DMV moved to suspend Victoria Wright's license was Nov. 21, 
1981, after she received four speeding tickets in 11 months. The outcome of 
those proceedings was not available from the record. 
</P>
<P>
She has since been the subject of at least nine more hearings. Her license was 
suspended at least twice, in 1986 and again in 1988. She appealed both times, 
and her license was restored. 
</P>
<P>
She was allowed to drive on a probationary license from May 1, 1987, until it 
was revoked Thursday. This followed a year in which Victoria Wright apparently 
escaped a jail term because the court reporting system broke down and regained 
her suspended license on a restricted basis after her mother's intervention 
with the DMV. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators are believed to be closely inspecting the sequence of events 
between the time Victoria Wright came before Judge Curtis on April 18, 1988, 
and the hearing before DMV official Dunn on July 18, 1988. This was a period 
when Cathie Wright appears to have been heavily involved. 
</P>
<P>
On April 18, 1988, Victoria Wright went before Curtis for two speeding tickets 
and driving without a valid license. He placed her on three years' probation 
with a 30-day suspended sentence and instructed her to inform the court within 
10 days of any future offenses. She subsequently received five tickets, none of 
which she reported as instructed. 
</P>
<P>
On May 18, Victoria Wright was cited by Simi Valley police for speeding and for 
not possessing a vehicle registration. Four days later, the California Highway 
Patrol ticketed her for speeding and not wearing a seat belt. 
</P>
<P>
These tickets were handled by Judge Clark, who was assigned to the Simi Valley 
traffic court at the time; Curtis was sitting in the Ventura traffic court. 
</P>
<P>
Clark said Friday that if he had known that Curtis had placed Victoria Wright 
on probation, the new tickets and entire case would have been referred back to 
Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't find out that she was on probation until last Friday," Clark said. 
"It wasn't in the files." 
</P>
<P>
The DMV record on Wright, usually reviewed by judges in such cases, includes a 
notation that she was on probation. But it was not on the computer printout 
that went to Clark last spring, said Florence Prushan, the Municipal Court 
manager. "Nobody knows" why it was omitted, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who is known as a tough, hard-line judge, agreed to the unusual step of 
dismissing both speeding counts in return for Victoria Wright's attending 
traffic school; he fined her $93 for the two lesser counts. 
</P>
<P>
Ordinarily, after an offender attends traffic school, listening to eight hours 
of safety lectures, one moving offense is dismissed, and the record is placed 
in a confidential DMV file accessible only to judges, DMV statisticians and 
researchers. 
</P>
<P>
The offense does not count toward the point totals leading to license 
suspensions, and is removed from records accessible to law enforcement 
officers, insurance companies and the public. Only one offense can be placed in 
this confidential file in any 36-month period. 
</P>
<P>
Practices on traffic school vary from one judicial district to another, 
according to DMV spokeswoman McGuiness. In some areas, she said, offenders 
cannot use the option more than once in three years, and in others, judges do 
not accept it at all. 
</P>
<P>
Clark declined Friday to explain why he allowed Victoria Wright to use traffic 
school for two offenses or to respond to reports of his alleged meeting with 
Cathie Wright. Court records show that Clark held an ex parte hearing -- 
meeting with the defendant or a representative of the defendant outside of 
court -- on the matter, Prushan said. 
</P>
<P>
Clark acted on Victoria Wright's case on June 27, 1988, two weeks after a DMV 
hearing officer had suspended her license for six months, according to court 
records. The DMV gets involved when a driver has received enough points for 
violations to trigger a license suspension or revocation. 
</P>
<P>
At the DMV hearing that led to the suspension, Cathie Wright appeared on her 
daughter's behalf and asked the agency to grant a restricted license, only 
allowing travel to and from work, rather than outright suspension. The hearing 
officer refused, noting that some of the citations occurred while commuting to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Next, the legislator wrote DMV Director A.A. (Del) Pierce on June 22 to request 
an administrative review of her daughter's file. Pierce assigned Dunn, a 
25-year DMV employee, to examine the handling of the case. Dunn said he 
performs this task for Pierce as often as 25 times a month. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria Wright then received another traffic conviction and asked for a 
hearing. Dunn took the unusual step of traveling from Sacramento to Van Nuys to 
conduct the hearing himself. He said he had not held a hearing in at least six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, Victoria Wright had had at least 12 speeding convictions in the 
previous three years in addition to an extensive earlier record. Despite 
calling her record "horrendous," Dunn said he decided to "give her the benefit 
of the doubt and restrict her driving to and from work." He also placed her on 
probation, directed her to go to traffic school and told her to advise him of 
any future offenses, something she failed to do. 
</P>
<P>
She did, however, go to traffic school. Her single traffic school attendance -- 
at the Tri-County Traffic School in Thousand Oaks on July 23 -- was apparently 
used to clear both speeding tickets handled by Clark as well as satisfying the 
DMV probation requirement. 
</P>
<P>
The DMV has no objection to the fact that Wright was able to make multiple use 
of the traffic school attendance, spokeswoman McGuiness said. 
</P>
<P>
By the time she lost her license last week and faced a return visit to Curtis' 
court, Victoria Wright had picked up a total of five new moving violations and 
had been in two accidents since Curtis placed her on probation. Three of the 
tickets and one accident followed Dunn's decision to grant her a restricted 
license. 
</P>
<P>
Her attorney is expected to appeal the revocation at a scheduled DMV hearing in 
Van Nuys on Wednesday.

Sean Elliott, Arizona's All-American forward, has two operational modes. When 
the Wildcats face inferior opposition, Elliott is efficient. But when Arizona 
faces a good team, Elliott is extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot 8-inch senior was in his extraordinary mode when Arizona met Oregon 
State in the semifinals of the Pacific 10 Conference basketball tournament 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott scored 29 points, and the No. 1-ranked Wildcats defeated the Beavers, 
98-87, before 10,565 fans at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona will play Stanford in the championship game today at 1 p.m. Stanford 
advanced with a 95-86 win over UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford handed Arizona its only conference loss this season, beating the 
Wildcats, 83-78, in Palo Alto. Stanford also beat the Wildcats last season. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott has averaged just 16 points in nine games against mediocre teams, but 
he has averaged 27 points against teams headed for postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
How do you explain it? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how you explain it," Elliott said. "That's my style." 
</P>
<P>
"Sean's by far the best big game player I've ever coached," Arizona Coach Lute 
Olson said. "I'm not sure there's ever been a better big-game player. Would you 
rather have him ready for the lesser teams or the good teams?" 
</P>
<P>
Elliott was ready for Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
He scored 21 points in the first half, hitting six of nine shots from the 
floor, including two three pointers, and made seven of eight free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott wasn't the only Wildcat who shot well. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona shot 71.4% from the floor in the first half, making 20 of 28 shots. It 
was a sudden turnaround from Friday, when the Wildcats shot poorly in a 62-54 
quarterfinal win over Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
What caused the turnaround? 
</P>
<P>
The answer is simple, Olson said. The Forum was too cold. 
</P>
<P>
"This place was like an igloo yesterday," Olson said. "Every team complained 
about the same thing. We had guys who were blowing on their hands to beat the 
frostbite. It was a lot warmer in Alaska than it was in here. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fine if they want to keep the ice (under the floor) cold, but they don't 
have to keep blowing air-conditioning on our heads from up above." 
</P>
<P>
Elliott agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"It was freezing out there on the court yesterday," he said. "At the end of the 
game, it was so cold that it felt like we were just barely warming up." 
</P>
<P>
The Forum was warmer Saturday, and so was Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats shot a season-high 67.2%, with center Anthony Cook hitting 11 of 
12 shots to set a Pac-10 tournament record. Cook had 24 points, including 15 in 
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt confident today," Cook said. "Everyone was shooting well. If our 
outside and inside is working, then we're hard to defend." 
</P>
<P>
Arizona (26-3) was dominating inside as the Wildcats won for the 18th time in 
the last 19 games. They made 16 of 18 shots inside the key against Oregon 
State. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State, whose forte is outside shooting, didn't shoot as well as Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Payton, Oregon State's All-Pac-10 point guard, missed 13 of 21 shots, 
Guard Eric Knox, who got into early foul trouble, missed 11 of 20 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Why did Payton and Knox shoot so poorly? "It (getting into foul trouble) hurt 
us because both Gary and I were shooting well (early) and that took me out of 
the game and let them concentrate on Gary," Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
Leading 27-26, the Wildcats blitzed the Beavers, 25-12, in the final 9:27 of 
the first half to take a 50-38 lead by halftime. Elliott had 13 points in the 
spurt. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona led by as many as 22 points before Oregon State rallied behind Payton 
(25 points) and Knox (23). 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State Coach Ralph Miller wasn't surprised that Arizona was so dominant. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a good team with no weaknesses," Miller said. "They're the type of 
team that takes advantage of all your mistakes. For us to have won this game we 
would have had to have played a perfect game." 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State (22-7) wasn't anywhere near perfect.

TOLLNER WILL HAVE TO PLAY QUARTERBACKS HE'S DEALT

<P>
The first thing you will notice about Ted Tollner, if you speak with him in 
person, is that he will be looking right back at you. He will be friendly but 
focused. Responsive but riveted. If eye contact were currency, Tollner would be 
a wealthy man. 
</P>
<P>
The next thing you will notice about him is a face and an enthusiasm you sense 
you've seen or heard somewhere before. It does him a disservice, but the names 
of Dick Vitale, college basketball commentator/buffoon, and Jim Lange, the 
former host of TV's Dating Game, come eventually to mind. 
</P>
<P>
Tollner does not string non sequiturs or shamelessly self-promote in the 
bold-faced and bald-headed manner of Vitale. Nor does he see the world through 
rose-colored glasses, the smiling way Lange used to when Bachelorette No. 3 
told her prospective date that her favorite book was the one full of coupons 
that the Welcome Wagon had left at her door. 
</P>
<P>
Tollner is straight-up-and-down serious about his new job as the Chargers' 
assistant head coach/quarterbacks. That is good for him. And it is good for the 
Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
The incumbent starter he inherits is Mark Malone, whose passing statistics have 
been the worst in the AFC each of the past two years. The hope for the future 
is a promising but untested young quarterback, Mark Vlasic, who tore up a knee 
in Atlanta late last season and whose medical future remains under a cloud. His 
fallback quarterback is much-traveled Babe Laufenberg, whom Tollner once 
recruited when Laufenberg was a senior at Encino's Crespi High. Tollner was 
then an assistant at San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
Can the Chargers, 6-10 in 1988, win with the quarterbacks presently on their 
roster? 
</P>
<P>
"My answer has to be 'Yes,' " Tollner says. "And I'm going to base it on this: 
The Chargers won six last year, and Seattle (winners of the dreadful AFC West) 
won nine. If you take three games and say: 'Can we take what's here and get 
more consistent with the improvement that's going to come from the natural 
maturity of some people and the continuation of this offensive scheme?' . . . 
If I look at the overall thing and say 'can we be some percentage points better 
at the consistency of the quarterback position?' My answer is, 'Yes,' because 
we're talking about a line of six to nine games." 
</P>
<P>
Tollner, a former college quarterback at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, knows the 
disproportionate importance of the position he now coaches. He also knows the 
Chargers' quarterback outlook could (and should) change, either through draft 
or trade, before the 1989 season begins. But more important, he knows that's 
the business of Coach Dan Henning and Steve Ortmayer, the team's director of 
football operations. 
</P>
<P>
So he will look you in the eye and say, "For us to do what we want to do 
offensively, the quarterback position is the obvious key. We have talked about 
it. But I don't think it would be proper for me as an assistant to get into 
that. It should come from Steve or Dan." 
</P>
<P>
This is the same Ted Tollner who ran the football program at USC for four 
stormy years. Despite taking over a team already on probation for ticket 
scandal violations dating back to Marv Goux, a John Robinson assistant, his 
record at USC was 26-20-1. It wasn't good enough. In eight games against 
arch-rivals UCLA and Notre Dame, Tollner's Trojans were 1-7. On Dec. 8, 1986, 
Tollner became only the third USC head coach to be fired since the school began 
football in 1888. 
</P>
<P>
Tollner spent the past two years in Buffalo supervising the wide receivers and 
waiting patiently for more responsibility. When the Bills replaced offensive 
coordinator Jim Ringo with Ted Marchibroda last month, nobody blamed Tollner 
for interpreting this as the right reason to listen to Dan Henning's sales 
pitch when the Chargers named Henning their head coach. 
</P>
<P>
Henning and Tollner had never worked together, so Henning's interest was a 
rarity in the relatively closed circles of NFL coaching. But mutual 
acquaintances -- mainly Washington General Manager Bobby Beathard and former 
Charger assistant Ernie Zampese -- promoted a meeting between the two. It 
lasted five hours. "The more we talked, the more I got excited about the 
situation," Tollner said. "Hopefully that's a two-way street." 
</P>
<P>
Said Laufenberg:"Dan Henning knows the passing game, and Ted Tollner knows the 
passing game. Plus, both have been head coaches. Effectively, we now have two 
quarterback coaches. On a lot of staffs, you're lucky if you have one that 
really knows the position." 
</P>
<P>
At USC, Tollner was largely responsible for developing Trojan quarterback 
Rodney Peete before the arrival of Tollner's successor, Larry Smith. Peete was 
a Heisman Trophy candidate much of last season. And it's not inconceivable 
Peete could wind up with the Chargers, although at the moment it's a stretch to 
imagine the Chargers reaching for Peete with the eighth pick of the first 
round. 
</P>
<P>
"Rodney offers many, many things, and I think he can play in this league," 
Tollner says. "First of all, he has the intellect that it takes to play in a 
sophisticated scheme. He has an excellent release, touch and accuracy on the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
"His bonus qualities of quick feet and scrambling are in the top echelon, and 
he has enough arm. He wouldn't be in that great arm category by any means. But 
there are people who have less velocity playing winning football in this 
league." 
</P>
<P>
The natural assumption in any discussion about Peete and the Chargers is that 
Peete, because of his history with Tollner, would have less to learn about the 
complexities that normally retard rookie quarterbacks. Tollner warns against 
that thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"The design and the terminology here are going to be different than what we had 
at USC," he says. "So he is going to have to learn, I would think, a totally 
new system." 
</P>
<P>
If he becomes a Charger, that is. 
</P>
<P>
Peete was quick to stick up for Tollner after USC fired him following the 1986 
season. "I would have bet anything he would have been back next year," Peete, 
the son of a football coach, said at the time. "He has done a lot for me, not 
just on the field but off the field, too. And I've learned a whole lot from 
him. I want to thank him for giving me all those opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
It was clear from the beginning of the 1986 season that Tollner's Trojans would 
have to show the kind of progress in the win-loss category that would make it 
impossible for Athletic Director Mike McGee to dismiss him. McGee and 
university President James Zumberge decided 7-4 wasn't the kind of progress 
they were looking for. 
</P>
<P>
But probations that kept the Trojans from bowl games in 1982 and 1983 and off 
television in 1983 and 1985 were too much to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Tollner retained his dignity throughout his last season and refused to 
burn bridges when it was too late to get back to the right side. "This year," 
Peete said of 1986, "he's written the book on handling pressure." 
</P>
<P>
But 10 times in Tollner's four years, the Trojans lost by 20 or more points. 
Only one of his teams finished in the top 20 in the final wire service polls. 
</P>
<P>
John Robinson, Tollner's predecessor, was a combined 11-3 against UCLA and 
Notre Dame and lost only two games by 20 points or more in seven years at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Smith is 18-6 in two years at USC, including a combined 2-2 vs UCLA and Notre 
Dame. He is 0-2 in Rose Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
Tollner's only public complaint upon his departure from USC was his insistence 
that USC broke his contract, which had two years remaining. It took about a 
year, but Tollner's attorney and USC officials finally reached a settlement. 
"Part of the settlement was for me not to disclose what the settlement was," 
Tollner says. "But it got squared away in a very, very positive light. It was 
very favorable." 
</P>
<P>
By way of comparison, when Trojan basketball Coach Stan Morrison left in 1986, 
it took 2 1/2 years to reach agreement on the remainder of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it took Tollner awhile to put the USC experience behind him. "I try to 
remember the best parts," he says. "All coaching jobs have their highs and 
lows, and my reflections on it, especially now that two years have gone by, are 
much more positive about the situation and the way it was -- coming in with the 
probation and leaving and having a moderate amount of success while we were 
there . . . winning a Rose Bowl . . . and having a winning record and going to 
two other bowl games -- we were moderately successful. Under the conditions, 
maybe we were more than that. But that's speculation. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we left it (the program)healthy. The first year (after the firing) I 
think there was hurt. The firing process stings a little more. But as soon as 
you get on with your life and get coaching again, the sting disappears and you 
reflect back on the whole thing. At this point, I reflect upon it much more 
positively." 
</P>
<P>
Was the firing fair? 
</P>
<P>
"I guess you have to say yes," Tollner says. "There was a difference of opinion 
on how the program should be run, I guess, between Mike (McGee) and I. And 
that's fair. He's the athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
"In my mind we were headed in the right direction. In his mind we weren't. He's 
in that chair. I think if there's a difference of opinion on where you're 
going, there should be a change made. You've got to be on the same page. From 
my perspective as a football coach, I believed in what we were doing, and that 
will never change." 
</P>
<P>
Tollner had been through lots worse than getting fired. He was one of 26 
survivors of the tragic Cal Poly plane crash on Oct. 29, 1960, in Toledo, Ohio, 
that killed 22 people, including 16 of his teammates. Tollner suffered a 
fractured and dislocated left ankle but returned to quarterback the team in 
1961. 
</P>
<P>
And now he has jumped from a team that advanced to the AFC championship game 
last January to a team with an impatient owner, an untested general manager and 
a new coach who lost almost twice as many games as he won in his only previous 
experience running an NFL team. 
</P>
<P>
But those are not the only considerations. All three of his children live in 
Southern California. His oldest daughter has also provided him with three 
grandchildren. Plus, he is already familiar with San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I know from when I was coaching at San Diego State the kind of excitement that 
can be generated in this community if you can win," Tollner says. "Whether we 
can get it back to that point or not, that's the challenge. I just keep 
blinking my eyes to make sure it's true that I'm back here." 
</P>
<P>
For better or worse, it's true.

NEW RULES FOR TESTING ARE NEEDED 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The board of directors of The Athletics Congress, the governing body for track 
and field in the United States, will take a historic vote today at a meeting in 
Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
If it goes as expected, track and field will become the first sport in the 
United States to approve a random, unannounced drug-testing program for 
athletes in training. 
</P>
<P>
Civil libertarians will protest, but people who are concerned about the effect 
that anabolic steroids and other banned substances have had on the sport, not 
to mention the health of athletes, recognize that it will take drastic, even 
intrusive, action to resolve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
If it is too much to ask of an athlete to submit to a urinalysis after 24 or 48 
hours' notice, then perhaps the athlete should find another field. That is not 
a suggestion just from antiquated, moralizing officials, but from the athletes 
who sit on TAC's advisory board. 
</P>
<P>
Most athletes, including many who use steroids because they believe they cannot 
be competitive without them, want drugs eliminated from the sport. 
</P>
<P>
They realize that it cannot be done by continuing to rely on testing after 
competition. The drug users are too sophisticated. In five major international 
meets since 1980, including three Olympic Games and two world championships, 
only four athletes tested positive for steroids or other strength-inducing 
drugs. Ben Johnson passed 19 tests in three years before he was caught for a 
using steroid at the 1988 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
But the institution of a random, unannounced testing program is not the 
solution unless it is administered honestly. For that reason, TAC should enlist 
the services of Dr. Robert O. Voy. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, that is about as likely to happen as John Tower inviting Sen. 
Sam Nunn to a cocktail party. 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons Voy, 55, resigned last week as the U.S. Olympic Committee's 
chief medical officer was his ongoing disagreement with TAC's executive 
director, Ollan Cassell, and officials of other sports. Even if they agreed 
with him that drugs are eroding the Olympic movement, they did not believe that 
he should announce it to the world. 
</P>
<P>
So they killed the messenger. 
</P>
<P>
Voy was not fired, or even asked to resign, but he believed that he was 
rendered ineffective when USOC officials no longer took him into their counsel. 
</P>
<P>
"My regret for the Olympic committee and the (sport's) leadership was that they 
were unable to take the heat from what I was saying -- having an honest and 
factual basis for my statements -- rather than muzzle, criticize or degrade 
me," Voy told the Chicago Tribune. "My object was not to point fingers but to 
alert people there were problems." 
</P>
<P>
In fairness to the USOC, Voy had a machine-gun approach to public speaking that 
often sent even innocent bystanders running for cover. 
</P>
<P>
When he said that he knew of positive drug tests in all but two U.S. sports -- 
figure skating and women's field hockey -- he did not mean that synchronized 
swimmers are bulking up on steroids. They might have been guilty of nothing 
more than taking cold tablets that had a banned substance as an ingredient. In 
that case, he was guilty not of saying too much, but too little. 
</P>
<P>
To the consternation of the media, he also did not always supply the evidence 
to go along with his damning statements. Sometimes he admitted that he did not 
have it. Sometimes he had it but was bound by his contract to conceal it. As 
his primary target seemed to be track and field, he and Cassell tangled. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, as Voy began to clean out his desk at USOC headquarters in Colorado 
Springs, he was vindicated by revelations in the first two weeks of the track 
and field phase of the Canadian government's inquiry into drug use by athletes. 
</P>
<P>
In eight days of extraordinary testimony, Johnson's coach, Charlie Francis, 
detailed extensive drug use by his athletes and implicated virtually everyone 
who has laced on spikes in the last two decades. He said that he believes 80% 
of the athletes at the highest levels of the sport have used anabolic steroids 
and other performance enhancing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
As Voy has in the past, Francis speculated that positive drug tests in 
international competition have been suppressed by officials. He also said he 
suspects that random, unannounced testing programs already established in other 
countries have been ineffective because their administrators are not as serious 
about stopping drug use as they are about protecting the sport's image. 
</P>
<P>
"We're awash in a sea of denials," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, denials from officials in the countries that he implicated, 
including the Soviet Union, arrived here in roughly the time it takes to make 
an international phone call. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the denials had a similar theme: How is it possible to believe Francis, 
someone now who encouraged his athletes to cheat, supplied them with drugs and 
then lied about it for almost 10 years? 
</P>
<P>
That is a point well taken. Although his attention to detail, his articulate 
delivery and his recall through 29 hours of exhaustive testimony were 
impressive on the witness stand, Francis' 21-year-old fiancee was probably the 
only one in the hearing room who believed everything he said. 
</P>
<P>
But we should all listen when Voy speaks. Coming from opposite ends of the 
spectrum, he and Francis have arrived at many of the same conclusions. Although 
Francis' credibility may be in question, Voy's is not. Not only did his 
integrity remain intact through five years with the USOC, it was never 
challenged. 
</P>
<P>
TAC needs Voy. That is not to say that TAC will have a dishonest drug testing 
program without him. But with him, it will be beyond suspicion. And after 
Francis' testimony, who in the track and field world can say that?

HOLYFIELD HAS HANDS FULL BEFORE STOPPING DOKES IN 10TH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<P>
LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In one of the best heavyweight bouts in many years, Evander Holyfield outlasted 
a courageous Michael Dokes at Caesars Palace Saturday night, stopping him in 
the 10th round and saving for himself a multimillion-dollar payday with Mike 
Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
Or he could make nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Holyfield's manager, Ken Sanders, challenged Tyson to a $25-million, 
winner-take-all match in September. 
</P>
<P>
There were some moments in this one, however, when it seemed as if Dokes' 
people, not Holyfield's, would be challenging the heavyweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
Dokes, the 30-year-old former World Boxing Assn. champion, who lost 33 months 
of his career to cocaine addiction, fought bravely with great skill and great 
power, and was by no means out of the fight when Holyfield took him out in the 
10th. 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield, who weighed 208 pounds, seemed about to cave in against the 
swift-handed, powerful Dokes on a number of occasions. 
</P>
<P>
But he extricated himself and saved Tyson-Holyfield. And finally, after 21 
rounds against heavyweights, he knocked one down. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't exactly demonstrate that he has a big punch. He did show, though, 
that he's one of boxing's most accurate punchers and one of the sport's 
best-conditioned athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Dokes' heart never failed him Saturday night. But his legs did. He'd lost the 
bounce by the middle rounds, and when Holyfield finally battered him to the 
canvas in the 10th, he could barely rise. 
</P>
<P>
It appeared for an instant that one of Dokes' cornermen, Sterling McPherson, 
had cost him the fight. When Dokes went down -- from a vicious right hand while 
he was on the ropes -- McPherson leaped through the ropes, bounded across the 
ring and put his arms around his comrade. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, referee Richard Steele was pulling Holyfield away from Dokes, but 
it wasn't clear whether he intended to stop it. Later, he said he was. 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield's people, as they threw out their challenge to Tyson, praised Dokes, 
who lost only his second fight in a 41-bout career. 
</P>
<P>
"There should be no question who Mike Tyson's next opponent should be," said 
Dan Duva, Holyfield's promoter. "And the winner of Tyson-Holyfield should fight 
Michael Dokes." 
</P>
<P>
Said Ken Sanders, Holyfield's Atlanta manager: "What we want now is the 
greatest sports event ever -- a winner-take-all fight with Tyson." 
</P>
<P>
Coming back from drug addiction problems that date to when he was 11, Dokes put 
on an inspiring effort for the crowd of 3,497. 
</P>
<P>
Hurt, stung and staggered repeatedly, Dokes' heart drove him back time after 
time. The same could be said of Holyfield, of course. 
</P>
<P>
When it ended, the three judges had Holyfield ahead by margins of 87-84, 89-82 
and 87-83. The Times had Holyfield ahead, 86-84. But right to the end, the idea 
that Dokes could at any time knock out Holyfield was not beyond anyone's 
imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Dokes lost a point in the sixth round when Steele deducted it for a low blow, 
one of several that Dokes threw in the fight. He hit Holyfield low three times 
in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield hit Dokes low in the first round, and Steele gave Dokes a minute to 
recover. Afterward, Holyfield implied it was retaliation. "He had hit me low so 
many times, I felt I had to." 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield (21-0) said he knew this one would test his resolve by the fourth 
round. 
</P>
<P>
"In the third round, I hit him on the chin with a real good left hook, and he 
came right back at me with some good punches, so I knew after that he could 
take a good shot and that I'd have to be very careful." 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield-Dokes brought back memories of 1970s matchups such as Larry 
Holmes-Ken Norton and Holmes-Earnie Shavers. 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield hit Dokes so hard with a left hook in the third, it knocked his 
mouthpiece out. Yet he fought back immediately, rocking Holyfield with rights 
to the head inside and slamming left hooks to the ribs. Dokes' left hooks to 
the body hurt Holyfield repeatedly, frequently forcing him to back up. 
</P>
<P>
Both men landed hard head blows after the bell to end the sixth, a round in 
which Dokes was cut over the left eye. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty seconds into the eighth round, Dokes hammered Holyfield with a 
half-dozen unanswered punches, but Holyfield then snapped Dokes' head back with 
a right uppercut. 
</P>
<P>
The end began about midway through the 10th, at center-ring. Holyfield tagged 
Dokes with a right to the body and made him stumble backward to the ropes with 
a left hook to the head. There, a long, powerful right caused Dokes to stumble 
along the ropes, and fall, as his compassionate cornerman, McPherson, suddenly 
appeared to save his man.

WORLD FIGURE SKATING CHAMPIONSHIPS; 
</P>
<P>
NEW GENERATION TAKES THE SPOTLIGHT THIS WEEK

Katarina Witt and Brian Boitano are gone. The dueling Carmens and battling 
Brians have passed their blades to another generation. 
</P>
<P>
The new elite of international figure skating have their first major rendezvous 
at the world championships in Paris this week, battling for supremacy in the 
build-up to the next Winter Olympic Games three years from now. 
</P>
<P>
Europe's main challenge lies with veterans Alexandr Fadeev of the Soviet Union, 
the 1985 world champion, and West Germany's Claudia Leistner, while the United 
States pins its hopes on maturing skaters like Jill Trenary and Chris Bowman 
and newcomer Kristi Yamaguchi, who puts her 4 feet 11 inches, 82 pounds frame 
against the world's best in two events. The championships begin on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
With each of the 1988 winners either retired or having turned professional, new 
world champions will be crowned in all four categories. 
</P>
<P>
Post-Olympic years traditionally give an early indication of fresh challengers 
for gold medals three years down the line although there are exceptions, as 
Witt proved to devastating effect. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, a year after the Sarajevo Olympics, the East German super star 
repeated as world champion, then hung around to dominate the sport for another 
three years instead of making way for new titlists. 
</P>
<P>
Boitano was in the background behind Fadeev and the other big-name Brian, 
Canada's Brian Orser, while future Olympic pairs champions Ekaterina Gordeeva 
and Sergei Grinkov of the Soviet Union were still competing in junior 
competition, Trenary had not qualified for the American team yet and Bowman was 
regarded as a flashy, but undedicated, former child actor. 
</P>
<P>
Witt, Boitano and Orser have now left the amateur stage, giving way to Trenary, 
Bowman and other individualists, while Grinkov and Gordeeva have emerged as the 
world's top-ranked couple. 
</P>
<P>
The most competitive event at the Bercy Sports Palace, the first world 
championships to be staged in the French capital since 1958, will be the 
women's tournament where the also-rans of recent years will vie for the medals. 
</P>
<P>
With Witt, Canada's Liz Manley and America's Debi Thomas all having turned pro, 
the battle for gold will be between U.S. national champion Trenary, European 
champion Leister and Japan's Midori Ito. 
</P>
<P>
Trenary, Ito and Leistner finished 4-5-6 at the Calgary Olympics while the 
order switched to Leistner, Trenary and Ito at the 1988 world championships in 
Budapest, Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I'm the favorite at the worlds and I know what I have to do, " Trenary, 
20, said after winning her second U.S. title at Baltimore last month. 
</P>
<P>
Leistner, after years on the fringe of success, won the European crown in 
Birmingham, England, in January. The 24-year-old West German was a silver 
medalist at the 1983 world championships. 
</P>
<P>
Ito, 20, delighted the Olympic crowd last year with her jumping ability and her 
happy demeanor and could benefit more than her rivals from the recent change of 
rule for the compulsory figures. 
</P>
<P>
Compulsories, in which Ito does not excel, are being reduced from three to two 
this year and will count for 20 percent of the total mark, compared to 30 
percent previously. 
</P>
<P>
A new original program replaces the short program, giving the skaters more time 
-- 2 minutes, 40 seconds -- to do the required number of moves and counting for 
30 percent of the mark. 
</P>
<P>
The final freeskating sequence is still worth 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
Ito beat both Trenary and Leistner in the free skating at last year's worlds 
and Olympics. All three of them, however, will have to watch another jumper of 
Japanese origin, Yamaguchi. 
</P>
<P>
Yamaguchi, regarded by many as America's fastest rising star, landed seven 
triple jumps and beat Trenary in the free skating at the U.S. championships. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old astounded the skating world when she qualified for two events, 
coming in second overall behind Trenary and winning the pairs with Rudi 
Galindo. 
</P>
<P>
In Paris, Yamaguchi and Galindo may have to hope for a mistake from Gordeeva 
and Grinkov to win the gold. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's event, Fadeev continues his comeback after an injury-filled 1988 
against compatriot Viktor Petrenko, who gained the bronze medal behind Boitano 
and Orser in Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
Looking to take advantage of any slip-ups from the two Soviets will be Bowman 
and Canada's Kurt Browning. 
</P>
<P>
The dance event continues to be a Soviet stronghold with Marina Klimova and 
Sergei Ponamarenko now firm favorites after four years of second-place finishes 
behind the now-retired Natalia Bestemianova and Andrei Bukin.

CAPITALS' RIDLEY PROVES THE NHL SCOUTS WRONG 
</P>

For Mike Ridley, there have been plenty of rejection slips along the way to 
becoming an NHL All Star. 
</P>
<P>
He was cut from his junior hockey team when he was 17. He was passed over by 
the Canadian Olympic team four years later and ignored by the NHL draft every 
year in between. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something I can always think about and say, 'Look at what I did and I 
never was drafted. I proved a lot of people wrong,' "Ridley said. "When I was 
playing at Tier II (Canada's Junior A hockey), an NHL Central Scout came to 
rate guys and I guess I wasn't rated that high." 
</P>
<P>
Scoring a goal and an assist in this year's NHL All-Star game and playing most 
of this year as the Washington Capitals' leading scorer, the 25-year-old native 
of Winnipeg is getting rated pretty high these days. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard the term late bloomer before," Ridley said. "I was always the top 
scorer on my (junior) team, but wasn't always the best in my league." 
</P>
<P>
Ridley made the New York Rangers as a free agent four years ago and has 
improved in each of his four NHL seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"He's come a long way since the Rangers' camp," said Washington left wing Kelly 
Miller, who came to the Capitals with Ridley from the Rangers in a New Year's 
Day trade two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's one of the best centers in the league," Miller said. "Mike really 
has come on this year, but I've always seen signs of it. There would be times 
(in previous seasons) where Mike would go into spells where he's been a little 
frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
That may come from all those high-scoring years in junior hockey that went 
unrewarded. 
</P>
<P>
After being cut as a 17-year-old, Ridley made the St. Boniface Saints of the 
Manitoba Junior Hockey League the next year, but only after switching from 
center to left wing. The following year, he blossomed. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was 19, that's when I really came on. I broke some of Bobby Clarke's 
scoring records," Ridley said. 
</P>
<P>
Ridley scored 91 goals and had 99 assists for 190 points in 48 games with St. 
Boniface in 1982-83. All three scoring totals still stand as league records. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes at Tier II, people thought I might be drafted but it never 
happened," Ridley said. " . . . If I was drafted at the time it would have been 
the greatest thing. . . . When I was 14 or 15, a friend of mine's brother, he 
was drafted by the Islanders and I'd look at him and go, 'Wow.' " 
</P>
<P>
The three Major Junior hockey leagues in Canada have been considered the best 
source of talent. After that comes the Junior A level, which is a more local 
brand of competition. 
</P>
<P>
Ridley said he had a chance to play for a Major Junior hockey team when he was 
20, but turned it down. He chose instead to go to the University of Manitoba. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want to give up your dreams (of playing in the NHL)," Ridley said. 
"You don't want to quit trying, but it wasn't in the front of my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Playing hockey for a Canadian university is not the place to launch a pro 
hockey career. "It's not a place many (professional players) come from," 
Washington Coach Bryan Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of a two-year career in which he was named Canada's College Player 
of the Year and scored 68 goals in 76 games at Manitoba, Ridley was one of four 
players invited to try out for the last spot on the Canadian Olympic team. 
Ridley wound up one of the other three. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like there was a day difference between (Canadian Olympic Coach 
Dave) King telling me, 'No, we don't want you' and when Reg Higgs called and 
asked me if I'd like to try out for the New York Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
"Wow. What a thing that was." 
</P>
<P>
Ridley walked into then-Ranger coach Ted Sator's first training camp and 
promptly won a spot on the roster. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a thing where I came in and I was so good I made the team," Ridley 
said. "They took a gamble on me. I got a break in camp with the new coaches. 
They wanted to do an overhaul on the team. They didn't have big centermen. I'm 
not huge, but I was bigger than anyone they had." 
</P>
<P>
After competing for a week with the rest of the team's rookies, Ridley found 
himself a little overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the toughest thing I've ever done in my life," he said. " . . . I 
thought, 'These guys are so good. Wait until the pros come in.' Then you start 
seeing guys you used to watch on TV. (Former Ranger defenseman) Barry Beck and 
those guys walk in and you've got to get on the ice with them." 
</P>
<P>
Ridley went on to become the Rangers' top rookie that year, scoring 22 goals 
and 65 points. After scoring 16 goals in the first 38 games of his second 
season, Ridley was traded to the Capitals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's January 1st. We had the day off and I was sitting around the house," said 
Ridley. 
</P>
<P>
Ridley got the news in a call from Rangers general manager Phil Esposito around 
6 p.m. and spent the next three hours on the phone with reporters and friends. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a little time to pack and get to bed," he said. "I leave the house at 
seven the next morning and I never saw my place in New York again." 
</P>
<P>
This season, Ridley has already surpassed his career-high for goals scored. He 
scored 12 goals in a 13-game span in November and December and then logged 30 
points in a 17-game spree in December and January. He scored four goals in 
Washington's second game of the season and recorded a team-record six assists 
against Chicago on Jan. 7. 
</P>
<P>
"He's more confident and a lot stronger," Murray said. "His strength has helped 
him immensely when people try to put a stick on him. . . . The big thing for 
Mike is he has to skate. He has to keep his feet moving." 
</P>
<P>
Murray has also seen a change in Ridley's mental approach to the game. "He's 
matured. He understands that there are 80 games and that there are going to be 
low points," Murray said. "In college hockey, you have to score every night to 
be a star and here (in the NHL) that's not the case." 
</P>
<P>
Ridley said his experience at the All Star game has helped. 
</P>
<P>
"You go to the All Star game and you talk to the guys and they say, 'Yeah, 
that's the way it goes sometimes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Of his improvement, Ridley said, "It's a lot of things. It's hard to pinpoint 
one thing. My confidence is probably higher than it has ever been. . . . The 
puck is not going in right now as much as earlier this season, but I'm getting 
my chances."

OFF-COURT TROUBLES CAN'T SLOW COLEMAN DOWN ON THE COURT

SYRACUSE, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What kind of year has it been for Derrick Coleman? Well, that depends. If 
you're talking basketball, then break out the thesaurus and start looking up 
superlatives. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm having a great season," said Coleman, who as a junior has 
established himself as one of the premier players in college basketball, a 
major reason why Syracuse is ranked fifth in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman's life away from the game hasn't been so great. You might call it 
tumultuous. In the past year, he has experienced tragedy and controversy. 
</P>
<P>
In October, a close friend was gunned down while sitting in a parked car on a 
Detroit street, the second time in 16 months that one of Coleman's friends from 
home had been murdered. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in December, Coleman was arrested and charged with criminal mischief and 
harassment in connection with a campus fracas and apartment break-in. 
</P>
<P>
Since the arrest, a highly publicized story in the Syracuse area, Coleman has 
shunned the local media, reinforcing his image as an enigmatic college star. 
</P>
<P>
So, Derrick, what kind of year has it been? 
</P>
<P>
"It's been an up and down year for me," said Coleman, referring to 
off-the-court events. "Sometimes I get real frustrated. I get frustrated off 
the court, on the court, with the coaches, frustrated with everything. But 
every obstacle that's been put in front of me, I've always overcome it." 
</P>
<P>
Coleman, described by teammates as an introvert off the court, has encountered 
many obstacles since arriving on campus as a heralded recruit. Most have been 
self-imposed -- notably his arrest -- resulting in an outcry from fans and 
criticism from the media. 
</P>
<P>
For instance: 
</P>
<P>
He quit the Olympic trials last summer after surviving the cut to 48; he was 
the central figure in two bench-clearing brawls last season; during a practice 
last year, he responded to a heckling spectator with an obscene gesture, and he 
made a fuss before the season after being told he would be moved from power 
forward, his natural position, to center. 
</P>
<P>
And, as if that weren't enough, he has lived with the burden of having missed a 
free throw with 28 seconds left that may have cost Syracuse the 1987 National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. tournament championship against Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
Headlines, always headlines. 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't been affected by all that stuff," Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim said. 
"He has answered the critics with his play." 
</P>
<P>
Said Coleman: "I don't understand it. I've lived up to every expectation that's 
been written about me, so what do they want?" 
</P>
<P>
There's no denying Coleman's basketball skills. At 6-foot-9, he can rebound 
with anyone, run the court like a 6-footer, handle the ball with the 
proficiency of a guard and shoot better than most players his height. No doubt 
about it, he's the complete package. That's why he's projected as a National 
Basketball Assn. lottery pick -- yes, even if he decides to turn pro after this 
season, a strong possibility. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what he can't do," said Stu Inman, director of player personnel 
for the Miami Heat. "He can run, jump, shoot, pass. We all see a big-time 
talent. In time, he's going to be a very good NBA player." 
</P>
<P>
In his first two seasons, Coleman was known mostly as a rebounder. He set the 
Big East freshman rebounding record and last season was the conference's 
second-leading rebounder, 10th nationally. 
</P>
<P>
This season, with center Rony Seikaly having gone to the NBA, Coleman has 
assumed a larger role. Much to his dismay, he had to play center. He also was 
asked to do more scoring. His response? He's fourth in the nation in rebounding 
(11.7) and blocked shots (3.7), and his scoring average has jumped from 13.5 to 
17.8. 
</P>
<P>
"He's shooting the ball better from the 15-foot range, which has made people 
come up on him and that's opened his passing skills," Boeheim said. Harry 
Hairston, the former Laker who coached Coleman at Detroit's Northern High 
School, finds it remarkable that Coleman has played so well under the 
adversity. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just getting over the first murder when his other friend was killed," 
Hairston said. "Derrick gets a lot of flak, but he's done everything they've 
asked. How would you feel if your best friend was killed and you were standing 
next to him? Those people (in Syracuse) are being very insensitive to him." 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1987, Coleman and his friend, Clarence Scott, were walking on a 
Detroit street when a man pulled a gun from a briefcase and shot Scott, 17, in 
the chest at close range. It occurred two blocks from Coleman's house on the 
west side of town. Coleman wore a black armband last season in memory of Scott. 
</P>
<P>
Five months ago, Darryl Dixon, 20, was shot once in the head, execution-style, 
while sitting with his girlfriend in a parked car. "Those guys were like 
brothers to me," Coleman said. "It was like a death in the family. It took me a 
while to get over it, and I still think about it every day." 
</P>
<P>
His troubles continued. Two months after Dixon's death, Coleman was charged 
with fourth-degree criminal mischief, a misdemeanor, and harassment, a 
violation, for his role in brawls outside a dance sponsored by a fraternity at 
the student center, and the subsequent break-ins at two frat members' 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman admitted in court that "I punched a guy," but he didn't admit to 
specific acts regarding the break-in. Coleman, who could have received up to 
six months in the county jail, plea-bargained and was ordered to perform 50 
hours of community service. He also was required to make restitution, believed 
to be less than $250, for property damage. 
</P>
<P>
"If it happened to a regular student, it would've been just another fight on 
campus," Coleman said. "But me, with the reputation I have as an all-star, it 
gets blown out of proportion."

AS A KNICK, VANDEWEGHE FOLLOWS IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF HIS FATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN GOLDSTEIN, The Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Kiki Vandeweghe, the chance to play for the New York Knicks, after spending 
his first nine pro basketball seasons in Denver and Portland, was an 
opportunity to carry on a rich family tradition. 
</P>
<P>
His father, Dr. Ernie Vandeweghe, was a popular guard for the Knicks in the 
early '50s, known for his relentless hustle and unselfish play. 
</P>
<P>
Kiki is a more gifted scorer than his father and should have a chance to win 
over the New York fans now that All-Star playmaker Mark Jackson will be lost 
indefinitely with a knee injury that may require arthroscopic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a good inside game with Patrick Ewing," said General Manager Al 
Bianchi, "and you try to surround that with as many good outside shooters as 
you can get. It's especially important in the playoffs when the game gets 
reduced to a half-court game. People talk about defense, but the bottom lime is 
putting the ball into the basket. 
</P>
<P>
"With Kiki, I had no concern about how he would fit in with us. I've known him 
for years. Johnny Newman and Kenny Walker wouldn't be human if they didn't 
wonder how bringing in another small forward would affect their role. But 
they're the type who can handle it." 
</P>
<P>
In his second appearance for the Knicks, March 2, Vandeweghe scored 23 points 
in 24 minutes against the Miami Heat. He is being used in a supporting role to 
Newman, but he is cutting into the minutes of Walker, an inconsistent shooter. 
</P>
<P>
Without Jackson, however, the Knicks will be hard-pressed to maintain one of 
the four best records in the Eastern Conference and gain a home-court advantage 
in the playoffs. They are being pressured from behind by Milwaukee and Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"Losing Mark is like cutting off your head," Coach Rick Pitino said. "It will 
be a very difficult experience, but we have a lot of confidence in (rookie) Rod 
Strickland. If he can hold up stamina-wise, he'll be all right and so will we." 
</P>
<P>
When the 1988-89 college season began, the top-ranked seniors by National 
Basketball Association scouts were Stacey King of Oklahoma, Pervis Ellison of 
Louisville, Sean Elliott of Arizona, Danny Ferry of Duke and Glen Rice of 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
But scouts have re-evaluated the blue-chippers, with Ellison falling out of 
favor and Ferry now being viewed as no worse than a second choice. 
</P>
<P>
"Trouble with Ellison is that he seldom breaks a sweat," said one NBA scout, 
preferring anonymity. "Right now, I'd rate King and Ferry 1 and 1A. Both could 
play center for certain pro teams, but Ferry's great passing ability makes him 
more valuable as a forward." 
</P>
<P>
The most interesting scenario, of course, would have the Washington Bullets 
involved in the 1989 NBA lottery, winning the first pick and forcing General 
Manager Bob Ferry to decide whether to choose his well-rounded son or King, a 
more prolific scorer and superior shot blocker. 
</P>
<P>
It just might make sense for Ferry to serve as Danny's agent. Who knows better 
how to negotiate multi-million dollar contracts? 
</P>
<P>
With a shortage of proven big men among the 1989 graduating class, it is 
expected that juniors J.R. Reid of North Carolina, Dwayne Schintzius of Florida 
and Derrick Coleman of Syracuse will declare themselves eligible for the draft. 
Otherwise, look for NBA teams to take a first-round gamble on the likes of 
UConn's Cliff Robinson, 6-10, and Joe Calavita of Vermont, who ordinarily might 
be second-round selections. 
</P>
<P>
First-round sleepers: Arizona forward Anthony Cook, Houston forward Richard 
Hollis, Wisconsin guard Trent Jackson and Seton Hall forward Daryll Walker. 
</P>
<P>
One Grant too many: On draft day last June, Chicago forward Horace Grant was 
hoping the Bulls would draft his twin brother, Harvey, of Oklahoma. Picking 
right before the Bullets, the Bulls selected center Will Perdue of Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought with (Bulls forward) Scottie Pippen hurt, the Bulls might pick me," 
Harvey said. "But I really didn't want to play in Chicago because I didn't want 
to get caught up with people saying, 'Harvey had this kind of year. Now it's 
your turn.' " 
</P>
<P>
Dutch treat: While the Indiana Pacers rank as one of the season's major busts, 
the rapid improvement of rookie center Rik Smits, the native of the Netherlands 
who played at Marist College, bodes well for the future. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest thing I've done is to get the other guys to accept Rik," Coach 
Dick Versace said. "I told them, 'You're witnessing the changing of the guard 
at center. This kid is a worker. And, until further notice, I expect you to get 
him the ball.' " 
</P>
<P>
Detroit playmaker Isiah Thomas is being credited with being the man behind the 
scenes in the acquisition of his Chicago pal Mark Aguirre from Dallas in 
exchange for Adrian Dantley. Said Dallas TV analyst Bob Weiss: "If the Pistons 
win the title, should Isiah be voted NBA Executive of the Year?"

Cal State Fullerton ended its basketball season Friday night with a loss to 
Nevada Las Vegas but applied the finishing touch Saturday by naming John Sneed 
as its basketball coach, giving him a three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
Sneed, 40, was named acting coach when George McQuarn resigned Nov. 3. He 
guided the Titans to a 16-13 season that included an upset of Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Sneed was an assistant under McQuarn for eight years. He was also an assistant 
at Arizona and San Diego State, and had a record of 81-8 in three seasons as 
the head coach at Verbum Dei High School, where his team won the CIF 4-A 
championship in 1974. ROBYN NORWOOD

THE GAME'S OLD MEN STILL GIVING IT A GO

<P>
In the autumn of their careers, a few major leaguers arrived in Florida and 
Arizona this year looking for one more spring. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Guidry and Tommy John, a part of the New York Yankees' past, would like 
another chance at the future. 
</P>
<P>
Darrell Evans, 41, is back in West Palm Beach with the Atlanta Braves. In Plant 
City, Pete Rose is the manager and Tony Perez a coach for Cincinnati. One of 
their old teammates on the Big Red Machine, Ken Griffey, wants to play one more 
year at the age of 39. 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Dave Concepcion, another part of the Big Red Machine, is trying to 
make it with the Angels at 40. 
</P>
<P>
"What will I do if I don't make it?" John, 45, said in response to a question. 
"I'll probably go home and play with my kids. I haven't had a summer free for a 
long time." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Ben Oglivie got his chance to go home sooner than expected. 
</P>
<P>
His comeback with the Milwaukee Brewers ended with a knee injury and 
arthroscopic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
John, Guidry, Evans and Griffey have survived the first full week of spring 
training. They hope to make it to another opening day, but there are no regrets 
if they don't. 
</P>
<P>
They have made their mark in baseball and have the numbers to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, a non-roster player with the Braves, has been a major leaguer since 1970 
with Atlanta, San Francisco and Detroit. He has 403 career home runs, including 
40 in 1985 with the Tigers at the age of 38. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wasn't ready to say I couldn't play anymore," Evans said. "I had 22 
home runs and 64 RBI last season." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Evans stood behind home plate talking to New York Mets manager 
Davey Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
As teammates with Atlanta in 1973, Evans hit 41 home runs and Johnson had 43. 
</P>
<P>
"I never really put a timetable on playing," Evans said. "When it ends it 
ends." 
</P>
<P>
If the Reds keep Griffey, he could be part of history. His son, Ken Griffey 
Jr., has a shot at making the Seattle Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
If they both stick, it would be the first time in baseball history a father and 
son have played in the majors at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
"I must be old if my son is about to become a major leaguer," Griffey joked. 
"I'm not the only old guy here." 
</P>
<P>
Also trying to win a spot on the Reds are Manny Trillo, 38, Joel Youngblood, 
37, and Kent Tekulve, 42. 
</P>
<P>
After the Yankees acquired Dave LaPoint, Andy Hawkins and Jimmy Jones, it 
seemed unlikely John and Guidry would be back. 
</P>
<P>
New Manager Dallas Green thought the Yankees needed to go with younger 
pitchers, but agreed to give them a chance this spring at George Steinbrenner's 
behest. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I can throw," Guidry, 38, said. "But I have to find out if I can still 
pitch." 
</P>
<P>
In a 'B' game last weekend, Guidry pitched two scoreless innings against 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
If Guidry makes it, the left-hander will be used as a middle-inning reliever. 
</P>
<P>
In the same game, John also pitched two shutout innings. 
</P>
<P>
"People know what I can do," John said. "I know I throw the ball well enough to 
still pitch in this league." 
</P>
<P>
John needs 14 victories for 300 in his career. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say I haven't thought about getting to 300," John said. "It would be 
special." 
</P>
<P>
Guidry has a career record of 170-91. "I think I reached the things that I 
wanted to do," Guidry said in his soft southern drawl. "Now, I started thinking 
about going home. Who wouldn't mind retiring when he is 38 years old?" 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, however, a few do mind.

HAWKINS IS KING OF THE HILL WITH YANKEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK O'CONNELL, The Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
FT. LAUDERDALE, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andy Hawkins, overshadowed in San Diego, has a chance with the New York Yankees 
to emerge as the ace of the pitching staff. Dallas Green has already identified 
Hawkins as the anchor of the rotation, a weight the 29-year-old right-hander is 
willing to shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
A baseball club is not a bowling team or a TV newscast, so what does Green mean 
by an anchor? 
</P>
<P>
"You can pencil him in every fourth or fifth day and feel good that you'll get 
seven to nine innings," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other managers speak that way about an ace, the stopper in a rotation who ends 
losing streaks and the workhorse of the unit who guarantees innings. Anchor or 
ace, Hawkins thinks he fits the role. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always going to be second-rated in San Diego," he said Thursday before 
the Yankees' intra-squad game in which he allowed one run and four hits in 
three innings. "No matter what I did I would always be behind Eric Show. It 
didn't provide the kind of opportunity I have here. I know I'll be consistent 
in giving the Yankees a lot of innings." 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees haven't had such a pitcher in recent years. No Yankee pitched 200 
or more innings the past two seasons. Hawkins surpassed 200 three of the past 
four seasons. Shoulder tendinitis in 1987 limited him to 117. 
</P>
<P>
The last Yankees ace was Ron Guidry, whose last big year was 1985 (22-6, 3.27 
ERA) when he challenged Kansas City's Bret Saberhagen for the American League 
Cy Young Award. 
</P>
<P>
That same season, Hawkins redefined himself as a pitcher with the Padres. The 
mild Texan developed a mean streak. His fastball became more effective once he 
started to pitch tight to hitters. Hawkins' heater tops off in the mid-80s but 
appears quicker because he delivers it from a motion that includes an elbow 
hitch. That momentary pause is a weapon to destroy batters' timing. 
</P>
<P>
"The fastball is still the toughest pitch in baseball to hit," Hawkins said. 
"I'm going to go after hitters and bust them inside." 
</P>
<P>
The change began in the 1984 National League playoffs and World Series when 
Hawkins yielded an earned run in 15 innings (0.57 ERA) in six postseason 
appearances combined against the Cubs and the Tigers. He carried that over into 
1985. Hawkins won his first 11 decisions, 14 of 15 and finished with his best 
record, 18-8 and a 3.15 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
As the Padres' fortunes tumbled, so did Hawkins'. He struggled in 1986 (10-8, 
4.30 ERA) and '87 (3-10, 5.05 ERA) but rebounded last year (14-11, 3.35 ERA). 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees liked Hawkins' ability to pile up innings enough to reward him with 
the wealthiest contract they've ever given a pitcher -- 3 years for $3.6 
million. 
</P>
<P>
He is among friends here. Former Padre teammates Lance McCullers, Jimmy Jones 
and Dave LaPoint are on the staff. Back in San Diego, they heard plenty about 
New York from Goose Gossage and Ed Whitson, but Hawkins isn't frightened. 
</P>
<P>
"Guys have walked in here and done well, and guys have walked in here and 
fallen flat on their faces,' he said. "I don't like to talk about whether I'll 
succeed. I know I have a great ballclub behind me, and I think I can do the 
job. Players are different. Some get scared and worry. Some don't. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball was an afterthought there," he said. "I know not everything said 
about a pitcher will be good. You have to have a thick hide. Since '84, I've 
wanted nothing more than to get back to the Series with a chance to win. The 
Yankees' goal every year is to win the World Series. I like that attitude."

DEVEREAUX IS TRADED TO ORIOLES IN EXCHANGE FOR PITCHER MORGAN

<P>
It meant going from the top of the baseball spectrum to the bottom, but Mike 
Devereaux was both happy and relieved. 
</P>
<P>
Convinced that he had little or no chance to win a regular outfield job with 
the World Series champion Dodgers, Devereaux welcomed the trade Saturday that 
sent him to the Baltimore Orioles for pitcher Mike Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles had the worst record in the major leagues last season, but 
Devereaux at least will get a shot at full-time employment. Beyond that, he can 
finally put his mind at ease after suffering through trade rumors for three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a big load off my mind," Devereaux said. "Now that this is over, I 
can concentrate on baseball. I'd like to be playing in L.A., but I just want to 
be playing in the major leagues." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan, meanwhile, said at the Orioles' training camp in Miami that he was glad 
to be with a winner after pitching for losers in Seattle and Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
"I was disappointed that I didn't get a chance to be a starter with the 
Orioles, but I'm excited about going to a winning environment," Morgan said. 
"Maybe I can start winning now." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan, 29, a right-hander, was born in Tulare, Calif., raised in Las Vegas and 
now lives in Ogden, Utah. He has spent eight seasons in the majors in a career 
that began at Oakland in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
His lifetime big league record is 34-68, including 1-6 last year, but he was 
recommended highly by Dodger scout Phil Regan, his former pitching coach with 
the Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
Although Morgan has started 119 of the 157 games he has pitched in the majors, 
Oriole Manager Frank Robinson had planned to use him in relief this season. 
Morgan prefers to start, but whether Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda accommodates 
him will depend on other factors relating to the team's pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to see what happens," Lasorda said. "I can't tell you anything 
about the guy because I've never seen him. I wouldn't know him if he walked in 
right now.' 
</P>
<P>
The trade was announced after the Dodgers' 13-3 exhibition loss to the Houston 
Astros. The deal was made after Dodger physician Frank Jobe examined Morgan's 
right foot. Morgan underwent surgery last Aug. 18 for an abnormal bone growth 
on his big toe, and Jobe found that he had fully recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan said of his physical condition: "Right now I'm healthy. My foot is no 
problem. I'm probably the only guy who ices his foot after a game instead of 
his elbow." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan's career earned-run average is 4.90. His only winning season was in 
1981, when he had an 8-7 record and a career-low 4.37 ERA. His ERA last season 
was 5.43. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Fred Claire, the Dodgers' executive vice president, was enthusiastic 
about the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that he has an outstanding arm and major league ability," Claire 
said.' 
</P>
<P>
Devereaux, who will be 26 on April 10, was once regarded as one of the Dodgers' 
top prospects. But he hit only .222 and .116 in his limited playing time the 
last two years. With Kirk Gibson, John Shelby and Mike Marshall starting in the 
outfield and Mike Davis and Franklin Stubbs available as backups, he was 
considered expendable. 
</P>
<P>
"I could see the opportunity to play every day wasn't going to come soon," 
Devereaux said. "It's hard to say I didn't get a shot, but I would have liked 
to play more than I did." 
</P>
<P>
Trade speculation involving Devereaux began when the Dodgers were negotiating 
the swap that brought first baseman Eddie Murray from the Orioles on Dec. 4. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was in that deal," Devereaux said. "When I wasn't (pitchers Brian 
Holton and Ken Howell and shortstop Juan Bell went to Baltimore), I started 
hearing about this one. It was a little distracting." 
</P>
<P>
Claire said of Devereaux, "He has a good chance to have a long major league 
career, and I hope he does." 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda added: "It's hard to give up a person of the caliber of Mike Devereaux. 
Sometimes you have to trade guys you think the world of." 
</P>
<P>
Cesar Cedeno, 38, is attempting a comeback with the Astros after what was 
supposedly a final fling in the Mexican League last season. 
</P>
<P>
Cedeno, who broke in with the Astros in 1970, drove in two runs with a triple, 
but obviously had lost his once-blinding speed. He was thrown out on a grounder 
to deep short that he would have beaten out easily in his prime. 
</P>
<P>
Left-hander Ricky Horton, who had been impressive his first two times out, gave 
up three runs in a one-inning stint. His problems were minimal, though, 
compared with those of nonroster lefty Dan Scarpetta, who was bombed for six 
runs in a nine-run sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Houston catcher Trent Hubbard entered the game as a pinch-runner in the sixth 
and wound up the inning with two runs batted in. He doubled after the Astros 
had batted around. 
</P>
<P>
"Every ball they hit had eyes," Lasorda said.

OZAKI BROTHERS DOMINATE JAPAN'S PGA TOUR

<P>
Chances are good that the winner of a Japanese golf tournament will be named 
Ozaki. That was the case last year when Joe, Jet and Jumbo combined to win 12 
of the 40 events on the Japan tour. 
</P>
<P>
The Ozaki brothers won more than $2 million in 1988, or about 11 percent of the 
Japan Professional Golf Association total purse of $18.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
And the "Jumbo Corps" is also coaching about 40 young golfers, including the 
next generation of the Ozaki golf dynasty -- Jumbo's eldest son, Tomoharu, 17. 
</P>
<P>
"I have taught Jet and Joe," said Jumbo, whose proper name is Masashi Ozaki. 
"Now I want to train and cultivate good international-level golfers who would 
further uplift Japan's standard in the sport." 
</P>
<P>
Jumbo, tall and boyish-looking at 42, won six titles last season, including 
three straight, and earned $993,350 to top the money list for the sixth time in 
his 19-year career. 
</P>
<P>
Following several off years that dropped him as low as 28th on the money list, 
Jumbo came back and placed second in 1986, next to Tsuneyuki "Tommy" Nakajima, 
and again finished a close second in 1987, this time to David Ishii of the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Jumbo has won 57 tournaments, a record in JPGA's 63-year history, followed by 
Isao Aoki's 50. On the all-time JPGA money list, Jumbo is second, with $5.17 
million, to Aoki's $5.69 million. 
</P>
<P>
Joe, 32, the youngest of the Ozaki brothers, won four tournaments last season, 
including the Japan Series of Golf, and earned $665,000 to place second on the 
money list. Joe, whose real name is Naomichi, turned professional in 1977, two 
years after middle brother Tateo, better known as Jet. 
</P>
<P>
It also was a bonanza year for Jet, 35. Despite a back injury, he won two 
events, including the prestigious, Japan PGA Championship, and $394,000, good 
for seventh in the money ranking. He placed third in 1984 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the JPGA offers $19.3 million in 41 tournaments, and another $7.1 
million for senior and junior golfers in 42 tournaments. The men's tour begins 
with the Shizuoka Open in central Japan on March 16. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we brothers will be able to perform even better this year," Jumbo said 
during a break while playing volleyball and dodgeball in fitness training with 
about 20 fellow pros and young students in the garden of his spacious residence 
on the southeastern outskirts of Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he cured his slump, Jumbo said he learned a lot from Jack Nicklaus by 
watching him play, viewing his video and reading his books. "I respect him as 
much as I admire him," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the six titles he won last year included the Nikkei Cup and the Maruman 
Open in which he negotiated narrow courses that normally trouble the long-ball 
hitter. He also showed an outstanding putter and his wedge shots all went in 
the middle. 
</P>
<P>
Jumbo, a former professional baseball pitcher, passed the pro golf test at his 
first attempt in October 1969, some 16 months after he quit baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"For several months during my first baseball off-season, I played golf for the 
first time. I liked it so much that I decided to become a golfer," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
In his second year on the pro tour, Jumbo, then 24, won the 1971 JPGA 
Championship and four other tourneys, starting a four-year reign atop the money 
list. 
</P>
<P>
"Japan's boom today in the sport owes much to Jumbo and several other promising 
professionals, including Aoki, who has won the Hawaiian Open and the World 
Match Play in Britain, and Ayako Okamoto, winner of the British Women's Open in 
1984 and winner of the U.S. LPGA money rankings in 1987," said Takenobu 
Watanabe, a director of the Japan Golf Association. 
</P>
<P>
Even though playing a round costs at least $100 and as much as $250, nearly 15 
million people, or more than 12 percent of the population, play the sport. 
Japan is second only to the United States in the number of golfers, Watanabe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Jumbo said he and his supporters pay into an annual fund of $160,000 to finance 
off-season group training. "The training is free of charge for all the young 
pros and prospective pros," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Jumbo Corps will be expanded to the Jumbo Ozaki Golf School within five 
years, eventually enrolling about 50 students and having its own commercial 
18-hole course, Jumbo said. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Jumbo will compete in a number of major tournaments abroad, 
including the Masters in April. 
</P>
<P>
"I know how stiff the competion will be at the Masters, but I might have a good 
chance if I could play at the Augusta National (Golf Course) as well as I did 
in some tournaments last year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Jumbo declined an invitation from the Masters committee. In a 
typical Japanese gesture of self-condemnation, he withdrew because of bad 
publicity after he played golf with leaders of a yakuza, or gangster, 
organization in Tokyo.

MURRAY PACES GLENDORA WITH 37 POINTS 
</P>

Dominguez High School Saturday witnessed what opponents of Glendora High have 
seen all season: the Tracy Murray Show, as the Tartans defeated the Dons, 
61-57, in the Southern California Regional Division II final at the Sports 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
After a shaky start, Murray provided a great ending, by scoring 19 
fourth-quarter points and finishing with 37, as the Tartans earned a spot in 
Saturday's State championship game at the Oakland Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Murray, the career and single-season state scoring leader, also controlled the 
boards in the fourth quarter, grabbing 10 of his game-high 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a team of great character," said Glendora Coach Mike LeDuc. "It is a 
situation where you have the best player around, surrounded by a group of good 
players." 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez, the Southern Section 4-A Division champions, held Murray to only 18 
points after three quarters. He scored only three points in the third quarter, 
as the Dons led, 47-40. 
</P>
<P>
J. J. O'Laughlin played a major role in keeping the Tartans from getting routed 
in the third quarter, scoring on three acrobatic layups to keep Glendora within 
10 points. 
</P>
<P>
Murray may have had problems early on, but he showed a preview of things to 
come with a three-point jumper with eight seconds remaining in the third 
quarter to bring Glendora to within seven points. 
</P>
<P>
"I had lost my confidence a little when I was missing," said Murray, who has 
not decided where he will attend college. of The choices, he said, are between 
UCLA, Louisville, Villanova, UNLV and New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"When I hit that shot (at the end of the third quarter), I said to myself 'I 
can finally hit a shot now,' " said Murray, who averaged 45.5 points per game 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez did not fold at the start of the fourth quarter, stretching its lead 
to 51-40, on an explosive, one-hand dunk by 6-foot-4 guard Xavier Edison. 
</P>
<P>
After that, it was all Murray. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Coach Russell Otis credited Murray for Glendora's success, but also 
praised Murray's teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"Tracy Murray is a good player," said Otis, whose Dons finish at 26-5. "But, 
Glendora is just not Tracy Murray, they are a good basketball team." LONNIE

EASTERLY, KATELLA COME BACK FOR 56-50 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
With 2 minutes 11 seconds left in the third quarter of the Southern California 
Regional Division II girls' championship game, Joni Easterly was where she 
least wanted to be. She was sitting on the bench with four fouls. 
</P>
<P>
Even worse, Katella High School of Anaheim was behind. 
</P>
<P>
Easterly got back into the game with 7:15 left, but not before asking Coach 
Barb Bausch "about five times" to go back in. 
</P>
<P>
When she returned, Easterly led Katella to a 56-50 come-from-behind victory 
over Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Katella (29-3) advanced to the state Division II championship game against 
Sacramento Grant next Saturday in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Easterly, a 5-11 forward who has signed a letter of intent to play at USC next 
season, had 24 points. She scored 14 of Katella's 16 points in the fourth 
quarter as Katella rallied from a five-point deficit with 6:50 left. 
</P>
<P>
However, Easterly had a rough first half. Her first two shots were blocked by 
6-4 center Chris Enger of Vista (28-4). She made only three of 16 shots from 
the field and had eight points. 
</P>
<P>
Katella still managed to lead, 28-22, at the half, largely because of the 
accurate shooting of point guard Angie Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez had 12 points at the half and 19 for the game. 
</P>
<P>
Easterly, who averages 22 points a game, found her shooting touch in the second 
half, but she got into foul trouble and Vista rallied. 
</P>
<P>
Enger, who had 20 points, led the comeback, scoring six consecutive points late 
in the third quarter and Vista led, 44-41, at the end of the quarter. When 
Kelli Schott made a jumper to open the fourth quarter, it was 46-41. 
</P>
<P>
But Easterly returned shortly thereafter and assumed command. 
</P>
<P>
Easterly made five of seven shots in the second half. Her two free throws with 
5:05 left put Katella ahead for good, 50-48. She added a short jumper, then 
drove around Enger for another basket and added two free throws with five 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Vista went scoreless in the last three minutes and had just two points in the 
final 5:05.

WALLY BACKMAN QUITE GLAD THAT HE'S A TWIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
ORLANDO, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wally Backman and Tom Herr are both switch-hitting second basemen who were 
acquired by the Minnesota Twins to bolster the top of the batting order. 
</P>
<P>
As far as the Twins are concerned, the similarity ends there. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately after coming to the Twins from the St. Louis Cardinals in 
last season's Tom Brunansky deal, Herr announced that he didn't really want to 
be in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
The Twins gave him his wish, trading him to Philadelphia during the offseason 
for left-hander Shane Rawley. 
</P>
<P>
Still uncomfortable with Steve Lombardozzi playing second and what seemed like 
a cast of thousands batting second, Minnesota sent three pitching prospects to 
the New York Mets on Dec. 7 for the 29-year-old Backman. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately, Backman announced that he was thrilled to be with the Twins 
and bought a house on Lake Minnetonka. 
</P>
<P>
"Tommy Herr never wanted to play here, so he didn't fit in with the rest of 
us," says first baseman and clubhouse leader Kent Hrbek. "Backman does fit in. 
You can see the difference just in the fact that Wally wants to have fun. 
Already, Backman and (Dan) Gladden are pulling pranks on each other." 
</P>
<P>
Backman says he was ready to leave the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
"The atmosphere is a little different over here," he says. "Not that it was all 
that bad in New York, but it was time for a change. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to the park every day with the idea in my mind to play every day, to 
win the other half of my job. But it just wasn't going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Backman batted right-handed so infrequently for the Mets the last few years 
that he thought about becoming a full-time left-handed hitter. 
</P>
<P>
"I always felt I could help the ballclub on a day-in, day-out basis," he says. 
"It started from the first day I got up to the majors, I got a rap that I 
couldn't hit left-handed pitching. I guess my record speaks for itself. I 
couldn't hit a lick right-handed." 
</P>
<P>
Although no one, including Backman, can put a finger on it, something happened 
early in his major-league career to reduce his right-handed effectiveness. His 
career average batting right-handed is .150, compared to .306 left-handed. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, at Class AAA Tidewater, his .293 overall average included a .294 
right-handed mark. 
</P>
<P>
But by 1985, his only full big-league season, he had become a poor hitter from 
that side of the plate. He finished at .273 overall -- .324 left-handed and 
.122 right-handed. 
</P>
<P>
After getting 520 at bats that season, he became a platoon player when the Mets 
traded with the Twins for Tim Teufel. Ironically, the Twins dealt Teufel 
because they wanted Lombardozzi to be their everyday second baseman. 
</P>
<P>
As Backman's right-handed chances decreased, so did his average. He batted only 
.083 righty in 1987 and last year got just 35 swings from that side of the 
plate. 
</P>
<P>
Twins manager Tom Kelly has thrown out Backman's recent record and has already 
named Backman his second baseman and second batter. Day-in and day-out. 
</P>
<P>
"He's giving me the opportunity to show what I can do," Backman says. "It's 
going to take a lot of work to hit from that side again." 
</P>
<P>
Righty or lefty, Backman, who has only 116 extra-base hits in his five-year 
career, is anxious to get some hacks in the Metrodome. 
</P>
<P>
"I should be able to get a lot more extra-base hits because the turf is so 
fast," he says. "I've always preferred turf because I don't hit too many balls 
in the air." 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, Backman says he is quickly getting comfortable with Greg Gagne, 
who has blossomed into one of the American League's best shortstops. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what it is. It seems to be too easy an adjustment," says Backman, 
whose .989 fielding percentage would have led the National League last year if 
he had had enough chances to qualify. "We're already turning double plays 
without any problem." 
</P>
<P>
Gagne remembers Backman from both players' minor-league days. 
</P>
<P>
"I played against him when he was in Tidewater. He was a scrappy player who did 
anything he could to win," Gagne says. "I don't think there will be any problem 
with us on defense. He's aggressive and I'm aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
Backman has noticed that almost all the Twins take an aggressive approach to 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mets were very determined to win it all in 1986," he says. "You can see 
that same kind of determination in the players' faces here. The talent that's 
here -- and there's a lot of talent here -- you're going to see it come out. In 
all honesty, as good a lineup as we had in New York, this is probably better." 
</P>
<P>
Which is one of the many reasons Backman is happy to be a Minnesota Twin. 
</P>
<P>
He says he'll miss the friends he made in New York but won't miss the constant 
scrutiny that a New York athlete faces. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad to get out of New York," he says. "It's a great city to play baseball 
in, but it got to be too much of a rat race."

JOSE LIND BRINGS BACK MEMORIES OF MAZEROSKI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
He has elevated the art of playing second base a step beyond its traditional 
bounds, to a level most mortals -- and most major leaguers -- can only dream of 
approaching. 
</P>
<P>
He plays in Pittsburgh, yet his grace, the sheer brilliance of his talents 
seems more suited for the stage rather than a stadium in a rough-and-tumble 
steel town. 
</P>
<P>
His range is almost limitless, his throwing arm is a cannon, the speed with 
which he removes the ball from his glove can be captured only by a high-speed 
camera lens. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, you were talking about Bill Mazeroski. 
</P>
<P>
Today, you are talking about Jose Lind. 
</P>
<P>
What Ozzie Smith did for shortstops -- raise the level of play a notch or two 
beyond all previous limits -- Jose Lind of the Pittsburgh Pirates is 
threatening to do for second basemen. 
</P>
<P>
All second baseman, that is, except Mazeroski, who, 17 years after his 
retirement, is generally recognized as the best fielding infielder of all time, 
a player whose defensive genius still may land him in the Baseball Hall of 
Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Lind, 24, is proud to patrol the same plot of Pittsburgh's North Side turf that 
Mazeroski once guarded so magnificently with one tiny, tattered piece of 
leather. 
</P>
<P>
"I never saw him play, but I hear was the best second baseman in baseball," 
Lind said. "I am looking to be the best." 
</P>
<P>
And Lind is improving, literally, by leaps and bounds. He recently underwent 
arthroscopic surgery to remove two bone chips from his right elbow, but he is 
expected to return -- with little damage to his strong right arm -- in time for 
the Pirates' April 4 season opener. 
</P>
<P>
Lind, whose range extends from near first base to the outfield grass behind 
second, not only has speed, computer-like reactions and unusual quickness, he 
has leaping ability that would impress any NBA player. 
</P>
<P>
Blessed with a vertical jump comparable to Dominique Wilkins, Lind has won 
dozens of friendly wagers by leapfrogging teammates and friends standing at 
full height. He amazed former broadcaster Joe Garagiola by doing so on a "Game 
of the Week" pregame show last season. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just Chico," said Pirates manager Jim Leyland. 
</P>
<P>
Lind's leaping ability has become a part of local sports legend so quickly that 
the Pirates will market a poster depicting him bounding over several downtown 
buildings. The caption, in sweeping Superman-style block letters, reads, 
"Chico, Pittsburgh's Newest Skyscraper." 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to make me famous," Lind said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
Ozzie Smith may be the "Wizard of Oz," but Lind is the "Wizard of Aahs." 
</P>
<P>
"A batter will hit a pitch and you'll think, 'There's a hit, there's no way 
he'll get to that.' Then you realize Chico's back there," said pitcher Jim 
Gott. "He makes the play look so routine, you wonder why you were worried." 
</P>
<P>
But while Lind's defensive artistry has become the stuff of which legends are 
made in just 1 1-2 major-league seasons, Leyland points out Lind, from Dorado, 
Puerto Rico, is hardly a one-dimensional player. 
</P>
<P>
Lind doesn't have Mazeroski's long-ball ability -- he has only two homers in 
754 major league at-bats -- but, like Mazeroski, he is a solid hitter who 
batted .262 with 24 doubles and 49 RBI in 154 games last season. 
</P>
<P>
And Lind thinks his career hardly has peaked. Mazeroski was known simply as 
"Maz;" Lind, at times, is simply "A-Maz-ing." 
</P>
<P>
"People may say you are the best, but you have to go out and play your best 
everyday, give 100 percent," Lind said. "I want to play in the All-Star Game -- 
that is a big goal -- so I know I have to get better." 
</P>
<P>
Does Lind, one of a new breed of outstanding young second basemen who are 
reaching stardom at the same time, someday hoped to be compared with Smith? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know, I don't think so, because Ozzie is the kind of player who does a 
lot of things in the field that you say, 'That is unbelievable,' " he said. "I 
just try to get better." 
</P>
<P>
But Lind acknowledges he has watched replays and wondered how he made a throw, 
how he got to a ball in short right field. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I get the ball far away, out in the outfield and I see myself and 
not know how I did it," he said. "When I play the game, I concentrate real 
hard, try to take off as soon as the ball meets the bat, I work on it every 
day."

SOCKERS GET NEEDED BREAK, POUND WINGS, 10-6

<P>
Nights off have come with regularity thanks to this season's stretched-out 
Major Indoor Soccer League schedule, but rarely have they occurred on nights 
when games are played. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers, in need of some relief after an exhausting loss to first-place 
Baltimore Friday night, got the soothing tonic they needed Saturday from the 
last-place Wichita Wings at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Tired legs seemed revived and worn-down emotions seemed refreshed after a 10-6 
victory over the Wings, who not only provided little resistence but also threw 
in a free goal or two as part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Branko Segota scored four goals, but it was Zoran Karic who received the 
evening's biggest gift in front of 8,740 fans when Wichita goalkeeper Cris 
Vaccaro assisted on his second-quarter goal. 
</P>
<P>
Vaccaro, standing to the left of the penalty box, tried to clear a ball but 
instead passed to Karic at the Wichita red line. Presented with an empty net, 
Karic scored easily to give the Sockers a 5-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
There was little worry after that for the Sockers, who snapped a three-game 
losing streak and moved back into a second-place tie with the Dallas Sidekicks 
at 19-17. 
</P>
<P>
"Lately, we've been getting chances but not putting them away," Segota said. 
"But this time, we finished off our chances and got ahead early." 
</P>
<P>
That was important, because the Sockers were a step slow, especially in the 
second quarter when they were whistled for a season-high 12 fouls. To show how 
little it mattered, however, it was the Sockers who scored three goals during 
that period to take control. 
</P>
<P>
Segota, who had scored off a pass from Karic in the first quarter, notched his 
second goal of the night midway through the second quarter when he stepped 
around Victor Moreland and beat Vaccaro with a line-drive shot on the short 
side. 
</P>
<P>
An unmarked Paul Dougherty scored on a shot that was deflected by the Wichita 
defense to make it 4-2, and then Vaccaro made his ill-fated clearing pass to 
Karic just before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Chico Borja scored for Wichita (15-21) to start the third quarter, but Segota 
scored twice more, once on a penalty kick and once on a free kick, to push the 
Sockers' advantage to 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
Segota, who it seems has needed some off-nights this season while trying to 
carry the bulk of the Sockers' offensive load, wasn't in a restful mood against 
the Wings. Along with his four goals, which gave him a team-high 27 for the 
season, he added three assists. 
</P>
<P>
Segota now has 42 career hat tricks, and his seven-point game was the first by 
a Socker since Segota himself scored seven (six were goals) in a victory over 
Cleveland in December of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Zungul added three goals for his 99th career hat trick, and Karic had two 
to raise his goal total to 26 as the Sockers reached double-figures for the 
first time this season and reached 2,000 regular-season goals in their history. 
</P>
<P>
"This game was a lot of fun," Sockers' Coach Ron Newman said. "When you have a 
lead, you can play more comfortably." 
</P>
<P>
Segota scored 9:54 into the game to put the Sockers ahead, 1-0, but Wichita 
tied the game less than a minute later when Erik Rasmussen scored on a penalty 
kick. Vaccaro sent Terry Rowe in alone with a length-of-the-field pass, and 
Waad Hirmez fouled Rowe from behind to set up Rasmussen's attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen, the league's Most Valuable Player a year ago, mis-hit his penalty 
kick, but the slow-paced shot fooled Victor Nogueira and beat him low on the 
left side.

Dawn Sowell led Louisiana State to its second women's title in three years and 
a relay world best, and Edrick Floreal carried Arkansas to a record sixth 
straight men's title Saturday night in the NCAA Indoor Track and Field 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
World bests were set by LSU's women's team in the 1,600-meter relay and by 
Clemson in the 3,200 relay. Hollis Conway, the 1988 Olympic silver medalist in 
the men's high jump, set an American record of 7 feet 9 1/4 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Sowell won the 200 meters Friday night in a meet-record 22.96 seconds, then 
came back Saturday night and took the 55 in 6.62 before anchoring LSU's relay 
team that clocked 3:33.98. 
</P>
<P>
However, since the team included Opal Cunningham of Jamaica, LSU's time cannot 
be submitted for a world record under international rules that stipulate all 
runners must be from the same country. 
</P>
<P>
LSU's time was far superior to the world record of 3:34.38 set by West Germany 
in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
With four first-place finishes, including Tananjalyn Stanley's victory in the 
55-meter high hurdles Friday in a meet-record 7.47, one second place, two 
thirds and a sixth, LSU finished with 61 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Tigers beat runner-up Villanova by 27 points, the biggest margin since 
women joined the NCAA in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Villanova's 34 points put the Wildcats 10 ahead of 1988 champion Texas and 
Alabama, which tied for third with 24 apiece. Indiana finished fifth with 21. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas which has won every men's title since 1984, collected only 34 points 
in edging Florida, which had 31. 
</P>
<P>
Floreal, a Canadian, accounted for more than half the Razorbacks' points. After 
finishing second in the long jump Friday night, he won the triple jump Saturday 
at 56-2 3/4. He needed to finish first or second in the triple jump for 
Arkansas to win. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas scored in two other events, Joe Falcon repeating as mile champion in 
3:58.06 and Reuben Reina placing third in the 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson's time of 7:17.45 in the men's relay went under the accepted world 
record of 7:17.8 set by the Soviet Union in 1971. But the Tigers' team included 
Phil Greyling of South Africa and Dennis Hines of Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
Conway cleared 7-3, 7-5 and 7-7 on his first attempts, before breaking Jimmy 
Howard's American record of 7-8 3/4, also on his first try. He had the bar 
moved to 7-10 1/2, but missed three times.

HOLYFIELD HEATS UP WAR OF WORDS WITH TYSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Evander Holyfield may not be able to beat Mike Tyson, but he is certainly 
learning to talk a better fight. 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield, who faced his sternest test in comebacking former champion Michael 
Dokes Saturday night at Caesars Palace, said his most vivid memory of Tyson was 
seeing him get knocked out as an amateur by Al "Chico" Evans in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him get hit on the chin and fall on his face," Holyfield said. "He was 
beating the guy from pillar to post and jumped in with a left hook. He got 
clocked. That's my biggest fear regarding Tyson, that somebody will do that to 
him before I get the chance." 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield had his chance in a sparring session at the 1984 U.S. Olympic Team 
training camp. Holyfield, then a 178-pounder, went two rounds with Tyson, then 
201. 
</P>
<P>
"They told him, 'Use your left hand only,' but I said, 'No way, use both 
hands,' " Holyfield recalled. "He hit me with one right hand on the arm and 
near knocked me across the ring, but every time he stopped punching I'd get my 
combinations off on him. I know I threw more punches at him than anybody else 
who sparred with him." 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield said the session was cut short by U.S. team coach Pat Nappi, who 
said, "This guy's got an ego, he'll try to hurt you." 
</P>
<P>
Someday soon, Holyfield will get another chance, without Pat Nappi there to 
protect him. 
</P>
<P>
Promoter Dan Duva went on a harangue aimed at Tyson and Hector Camacho at 
Wednesday's Holyfield-Dokes news conference, saying he was offended that "two 
great fighters" shouldn't be fighting "bums." 
</P>
<P>
"I have more respect for Mike Tyson than for any other fighter in the world," 
Duva said. "But I'm disgusted that he wants to fight Jose Ribalta next. And now 
I hear Camacho wants to fight Harry Arroyo next. Forget about the Ribaltas and 
the Carl Williamses. Mike Tyson should only be talking about fighting the 
winner of this fight. The public deserves to see good fights between good 
fighters." 
</P>
<P>
There was a sense of urgency to Duva's tirade, for good reason. The Dokes fight 
ends the Duva-Holyfield promotional contract, and the Titans of Totowa 
desperately want a piece of the potentially huge Holyfield-Tyson pie. 
</P>
<P>
They also would like to get Camacho in the ring with Meldrick Taylor, who was 
to have fought mandatory challenger Jong-Jong Pacquing of the Philippines on 
the undercard. Taylor tore knee cartilage while jumping rope Wednesday, forcing 
postponement of the fight. 
</P>
<P>
Duva was rebuffed on Saturday when he tried to talk Taylor-Camacho with Patrick 
Flannery even before Camacho's poor effort against Ray Mancini. And with the 
expiration of the Holyfield contract, the Duvas have an agreement with 
Holyfield's manager, Ken Sanders, that gives them five months to make a Tyson 
fight -- probably not enough time. And Sanders has several other offers to 
consider. 
</P>
<P>
"If Tyson doesn't fight for five more months, the clock runs out on (the 
Duvas), not us," Sanders said. "But they've been good to us so we might still 
do it with them anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Then again, they might not. 
</P>
<P>
Could be fireworks at this year's Boxing Writers Association of America awards 
dinner. Winner of this year's Edward J. Neil fighter of the year award, 
predictably enough, is Tyson. Winner of the Al Buck manager-trainer of the year 
award is Kevin Rooney, recently banished from Tyson's corner. Some mischievous 
type is sure to seat them together on the dais. Then again, maybe it will 
precipitate a reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
The other winners: veteran referee Arthur Mercante, the James J. Walker Award 
for long and meritorious service to boxing; unbeaten light-heavyweight Michael 
Moorer, the Cus D'Amato prospect of the year award; and Al Bernstein, the Sam 
Taub Award for excellence in boxing broadcasting.

HOLLAHAN'S PLUCKY FINISH AVERTS CSUN SHUTOUT

<P>
It was Saturday, and time to rock or get rolled for Ted Hollahan, Cal State 
Northridge's resident swim champion/bass guitarist. 
</P>
<P>
No longer would he settle for opening act to the Hilton's main show. 
</P>
<P>
Hilton Woods, from Oakland (Mich.) University, had overstepped his bounds. On 
Friday, he had defeated Hollahan in the CSUN junior's best event, the 200-yard 
freestyle, at the Division II national swimming and diving championships. 
</P>
<P>
As he lined up next to his adversary for the 100-yard freestyle Saturday, 
Hollahan told himself it was redemption time. 
</P>
<P>
"Winning was the only thing I could do to salvage the meet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Consider it done. But by the slimmest of margins. 
</P>
<P>
Hollahan, trailing by a half-length with 25 yards to go, rallied to win in 
45.01 seconds, 1/100th of a second ahead of Woods. 
</P>
<P>
Hollahan's victory kept the Northridge men's team from getting shut out in the 
win column for the first time this decade. 
</P>
<P>
Should Hollahan decide to train hard, CSUN Coach Pete Accardy claims, the team 
won't have to wait as long next year. 
</P>
<P>
But to reach his potential, he may have to put swimming ahead of music, 
something he has never done before. 
</P>
<P>
In his hometown of Denver, Hollahan was a member of a band called Single File, 
which opened for several well-known groups, including .38 Special and Stryker. 
</P>
<P>
"He's already talking like he's going to train hard next year," Accardy said. 
"He could be great. As good as he is, Hilton Woods shouldn't be able to touch 
Ted." 
</P>
<P>
Woods, a sophomore, anchored three victorious relay teams, was second in the 
100-yard backstroke and the 100-yard freestyle and won the 50-yard freestyle in 
a record time of 20.00 in addition to taking the 200 free title. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Bakersfield won its fourth consecutive men's team championship. 
Bakersfield swimmers accounted for 31 top-six finishes in the four-day meet and 
won by a commanding 571-406 margin over second-place Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, competing with only seven swimmers, finished sixth in the team 
standings. Kurt White, John Kunishima and Tim Arnold also scored for CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
White won the consolation championship in the 200-yard backstroke with a 
personal best of 1:54.72. Kunishima was sixth in the 100-yard freestyle in 
46.26, and Arnold was ninth in the 1,650-yard freestyle in 16:11.62.

NORTHRIDGE'S TITLE WAVE ROLLS ON;

LADY MATADORS WIN TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP FOR 3RD YEAR IN A ROW

<P>
If winning 13 Division II national swimming team championships in his 19 
seasons at Cal State Northridge has taught Coach Pete Accardy one thing it is 
this: 
</P>
<P>
When you leave your hotel room for the final night of racing at the national 
meet, be prepared. 
</P>
<P>
For Accardy, that means taking along a pair of shorts and a change of clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Having worn jeans throughout the meet, Accardy chose to show up in even more 
casual attire Saturday evening at the State University of New York (Buffalo) 
natatorium. Asked why, he responded, "because shorts dry faster than jeans." 
</P>
<P>
Ah, the voice of experience. 
</P>
<P>
For the third consecutive season, Accardy took a post-meet pool plunge courtesy 
of the Northridge women's team. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Matadors wrapped up their fourth team championship since 1982 by a 
comfortable 397-280 margin over North Dakota State . 
</P>
<P>
Northridge won an unprecedented 10 of the 18 swimming events, including three 
on the meet's final day. There were also 13 other top-six finishes by the Lady 
Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
Tina Schnare, Toady Kimble and the 400-yard freestyle relay team of Jude 
Kylander, Stacy Mettam, Michelle Sulak and Kimble were Northridge's winners on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Schnare, a senior from Manhattan Beach, concluded her swimming career with a 
pair of accomplishments that can never be bettered. 
</P>
<P>
She won national titles in the 100 and 200-yard breaststrokes four consecutive 
years. In addition to her eight individual championships, Schnare also swam 
legs on seven winning relay teams. 
</P>
<P>
Only Army's Ann Marie Wycoff has more individual championships. She won her 
ninth -- and her fourth in this year's national meet -- in the 1,650-yard 
freestyle on Saturday. Wycoff was later selected as the meet's top woman 
swimmer by a vote of coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Schnare's victory Saturday came in the 200-yard breaststroke. Her time of 
2:20.18 was just off her record performance of 2:19.78 at the same site last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I wasn't going to break the record. I was exhausted," Schnare said. 
</P>
<P>
"She got the job done," Accardy said. "She lost her legs in the last 50 yards 
or she would have gone 2:18." 
</P>
<P>
A Northridge victory in the 100-yard freestyle was no surprise -- but the 
swimmer who accomplished it was. 
</P>
<P>
Toady Kimble, a sophomore who failed to even qualify for last year's national 
meet, held off teammate Jude Kylander to win in a school-record time of 51.40. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble took the lead with a perfect turn off the first wall, then held off a 
late charge by Kylander, the pre-race favorite. 
</P>
<P>
"I hoped to go out fast," Kimble said. "I knew I had to be ahead coming off the 
last wall or she'd kill me coming home." 
</P>
<P>
Kylander, the former school record-holder, was second with a personal-best time 
of 51.51. She concluded her collegiate career with three individual and 13 
relay championships 
</P>
<P>
Stacy Mettam, who won five individual and seven relay titles in her career, 
ended on a low note. She was fifth in the 200-yard backstroke with a time of 
2:09.30 -- some four seconds off her lifetime best. 
</P>
<P>
Accardy called it a mystery race. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the first bad race I've ever seen her have when it counted," Accardy 
said of Mettam. "She wasn't in the race right from the start." 
</P>
<P>
It may not have concluded as planned, but Mettam should be able to take some 
solace in her contribution to CSUN's team. 
</P>
<P>
With Schnare, Kylander and Mettam leading the way, the Lady Matadors have 
dominated the past three national meets as no team had before. 
</P>
<P>
"I never dreamed I'd be on this caliber of a team," Schnare said. "Winning 
championships . . . . now it's a tradition." 
</P>
<P>
But one that will now have to survive minus its nucleus of four years. 
</P>
<P>
Accardy doesn't seem to concerned, however. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the same thing in '85," Accardy said. "Then these three walked in."

CSUN'S PILE STEPS FORWARD WITH TOP TRIPLE JUMP MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lolita Pile of Cal State Northridge is reluctant to concern herself with 
statistics because pressure tends to increase along with the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Asked her personal bests, she answers in estimates. 
</P>
<P>
But her attitude may change -- whether she likes it or not -- after she won the 
women's triple jump with a personal best of 42 feet at a quadrangular track 
meet Saturday at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
After all, it's not often that a Northridge athlete produces a national-best 
outdoor mark -- Sylvia Dyer of Abilene Christian jumped 42-8 1/2 indoors -- but 
that's what Pile, a diminutive (5-4 1/2, 110-pound) junior dynamo, did at Drake 
Stadium, helping the Lady Matadors to a third-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, the defending NCAA champion, scored 96 points to win the women's meet, 
followed by Cal (38), Northridge (34) and Azusa Pacific (2). 
</P>
<P>
Janeene Vickers, a UCLA sophomore, won three events (100-meter low hurdles, 400 
meters and 400 low hurdles) and ran legs on the victorious 400 and 1,600 
relays. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's triangular meet, the two-time defending NCAA champion Bruins 
scored 98 points to beat Azusa Pacific (50) and Northridge (43). 
</P>
<P>
Although it's true that many of the nation's leading triple jumpers -- such as 
Sheila Hudson of Cal and Wendy Brown of USC -- have yet to jump outdoors this 
season, Pile's mark is still noteworthy. It improved her school record (40-8 
1/4) by more than a foot and qualified her for the NCAA Division II 
championships in Hampton, Va., in May. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was a good jump," said Pile, who had three jumps better than 40 feet 
and five jumps measuring 39-9 3/4 or better. "But I figured it was a 40-foot 
jump, 41 tops. . . . I was really surprised when they said 42. It just felt so 
easy." 
</P>
<P>
Pile also teamed with Carol Collier, Alicia Bell and Mary Coleman to place 
third in the 400 relay. Northridge clocked 47.17, missing the Division II 
qualifying standard by 0.07 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman also placed fourth in the women's 400 in 56.00 seconds, a tenth of a 
second shy of the Division II standard. 
</P>
<P>
Pile's performance overshadowed a superb double by teammate Darcy Arreola, who 
won the 3,000 meters in 9 minutes, 27.9 seconds, and came back 35 minutes later 
to win the 1,500 in 4:20.36. 
</P>
<P>
Both times were season bests for Arreola, the defending Division II champion in 
both races. She displayed strong finishing kicks in each race. 
</P>
<P>
In the 3,000, Arreola ran the final 400 in 68.3, surging past runner-up Laurie 
Chapman of UCLA with 300 meters left. In the 1,500, she sped past UCLA's Laura 
Chapel with 250 meters to go, running a 64-second last lap. 
</P>
<P>
"She's really running well right now," CSUN Coach Don Strametz said. "Her 1,500 
was really impressive when you consider that it started 30 minutes after she 
finished the 3,000." 
</P>
<P>
Tyrone Jeffries, Walt Stewart and Jerry Gilmore led Northridge in the men's 
meet. 
</P>

LADY BRONCOS HOLD OFF CSUN IN OVERTIME TO WIN REGIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Niki Bracken said she knew that the game was over as soon as she heard her 
coach say, "It's ours." 
</P>
<P>
Darlene May made that proclamation as she huddled with her Cal Poly Pomona 
women's basketball team before the start of the overtime period of Saturday 
night's game against Cal State Northridge for the championship of the NCAA 
Division II West regional. 
</P>
<P>
Bracken, Pomona's 6-foot-2 center, and the rest of the Lady Broncos apparently 
took May's words to heart as Pomona defeated Northridge, 83-82, before 606 
spectators at Cal Poly Pomona's Kellogg Gym. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona (26-5), which has won three national titles, will meet St. Joseph's of 
Indiana, an 80-59 winner Saturday over Oakland (Mich.), in the Division II 
quarterfinals March 17 or 18 at a site to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
"I always thought we would win -- even when we were down," May said. "But I 
didn't know it would be that close." 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in four years that Northridge has lost to Pomona in the 
regional final. The Lady Broncos beat Northridge, 66-46, in 1986 en route to 
their third NCAA title. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, which lost three of four games to Pomona this season, finished 
22-9, establishing a school record for victories in a season. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been the best group I've had in every way," said Coach Leslie Milke, 
who completed her sixth season with the Lady Matadors. "Not just the won-loss 
record, because that's a bonus. They're the best group I've been associated 
with." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge trailed, 79-77, with 18 seconds left in overtime when sophomore 
guard Bridgette Ealy missed a two-foot jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
"It just slipped out of my hands," Ealy said. "No one hit it and no one fouled 
me. It just slipped." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Luckinbill got the rebound and was fouled by Northridge forward Julie 
Arlotto. Luckinbill then made two free throws to give her seven points in the 
overtime period and put Pomona ahead, 81-77. 
</P>
<P>
Dawn Broline made a seven-foot shot with nine seconds left to bring Northridge 
within 81-79, but five seconds later, Chris Cavalin fouled Pomona's Stephanie 
Coons. 
</P>
<P>
Coons made a pair of free throws and that proved to be the difference when 
Northridge's Vicki Mallett made a three-point shot at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
Bracken followed her 32-point performance Friday against Hayward with 29 points 
against Northridge and was named the MVP of the regional. All-American guard 
Cathy Gooden had 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
Arlotto led Northridge with 24 points and eight rebounds and Cavalin had 18 
points and 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Regulation ended with the score, 69-69. 
</P>
<P>
With Bracken on the bench with four fouls, Northridge used a half-court 
trapping defense to turn a 49-46 deficit into a 54-53 lead with nine minutes 
left. 
</P>
<P>
The teams traded baskets down the stretch with Arlotto giving Northridge a 
69-68 lead with 1:50 left. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge had possession after calling a timeout with 40 seconds left and 12 
seconds on the shot clock, but the Lady Matadors could not get a good shot so 
Paula Lucas threw up a 26-foot jump shot from the top of the key, then fouled 
Coons going for the rebound. 
</P>
<P>
Coons hit the front end of a one and one with 26 seconds left to tie the score, 
69-69, and when Mallett missed a 14-foot shot off a drive, the teams went into 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Poly Pomona led, 30-26, at halftime behind the play of Bracken and Gooden, 
who scored six and four points, respectively, during a 12-0 run that put the 
Lady Broncos ahead at intermission.

WESTMONT LOSES PAIR AT CAL LUTHERAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal Lutheran used power hitting in the opener and capitalized on mistakes in 
the second game to sweep a Golden State Athletic Conference baseball 
doubleheader over Westmont, 6-5 and 5-3, Saturday at Cal Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Espitia's tie-breaking home run with two out in the seventh and final 
inning carried Cal Lutheran in the opener. Espitia finished the game two for 
four with two runs batted in and scored two runs. 
</P>
<P>
Teammates Devon Schutzler and Jeff Brouelette also homered in the opener. 
</P>
<P>
Senior right-hander Jay Anderson (2-1) went the full seven innings, allowing 
four hits to earn the win. He walked one and struck out six, giving him a 
team-leading 20 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran (11-4, 4-0 in the conference), benefiting from four walks, two 
hits, two wild pitches, a hit batter and an error, scored five times in the 
first inning of the second game. 
</P>
<P>
Junior right-hander Mike Clark (2-0) went six innings, allowing five hits and 
three runs (two earned) to claim the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Dean Martinez allowed one hit over the final three innings to earn his first 
save. Martinez walked three and struck out two. 
</P>

DEFENDING CITY CHAMPION MONROE PREPARES TO QUIET SKEPTICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Vince Kowalick 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What do Tim Costic, Sean Henson and the rest of the Monroe High baseball team 
have in common with Rodney Dangerfield? 
</P>
<P>
Well, let's just say that recognition from peers for a job well done is slow in 
coming. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we have something to prove this year," said Henson, a junior 
left-hander. "Last year, no one believed it. We weren't supposed to do 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the Vikings did everything. Henson (4-4) rebounded from academic 
ineligibility to pitch a five-hitter with 10 strikeouts in the City Section 4-A 
Division final, a 3-2 victory over San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
Costic, The Times' Valley Player of the Year, batted .426 with five home runs, 
11 doubles and 37 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Both players admit it was an improbable season. Monroe, the only fourth-place 
team to win the 4-A title, finished 13-16. 
</P>
<P>
Critics, Costic said, explain the Vikings' ascent from Mid-Valley League 
mediocrity to City champions with one word: fluke. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to go out there and have a good season and show that it wasn't," 
Costic said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Henson: "I think there wasn't a team we couldn't beat last year. But 
people were saying, 'Oh, it was luck.' 
</P>
<P>
"This year, we want to prove that it wasn't a fluke." 
</P>
<P>
Monroe opened the season Thursday with an 8-2 nonleague win over Buckley. One 
thing is certain: The victory was no fluke. 
</P>
<P>
Buckley, a Southern Section school of 280 students, was 2-17 last year and 0-10 
in the Delphic League. Monroe opens league play Tuesday at Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
Why worry?: What's all this fuss about Chatsworth losing a couple of ballgames? 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's saying, 'What's wrong,' and we're 2-2," Coach Bob Lofrano quipped 
before Saturday's 12-2 victory over Hueneme in the Westside tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Lofrano, however, is not amused with his team's early performance, especially 
Thursday's game against Rio Mesa in which the Chancellors committed six errors. 
</P>
<P>
"Defensively," Lofrano said, "we stunk." 
</P>
<P>
After opening the season with a 19-2 rout of Ventura, Chatsworth lost to Notre 
Dame, 6-5, after leading, 4-0, through four innings. 
</P>
<P>
That was followed by a 9-6 loss to Canyon (5-15 last year) before an eight-run, 
eighth-inning rally finally felled Rio Mesa, 13-5. 
</P>
<P>
Lofrano considers it "a compliment to the program" that because of shaky play 
the Chancellors are under scrutiny. Last year, Chatsworth was 25-2 and ranked 
No. 1 nationwide by Collegiate Baseball and USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
The Chancellors lost to San Fernando, 5-2, in the City 4-A semifinals. "But the 
way we're playing," junior right-hander Reed McMackin said, "we don't want to 
be No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
Said Lofrano: "We're disappointed, but it's not push-the-panic-button time. We 
need to play better and everybody knows it, from me all the way down to the 
last kid on the team. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't just say, 'Oh, well, it's only a scrimmage,' or 'Oh, well, it's only 
a tournament game,' or pretty soon it's gonna be, 'Oh, well, it's only the last 
game of the season.' " 
</P>
<P>
Add Chatsworth: Lofrano offered some constructive criticism to the L. A. 
Unified School District last week. Construction was scheduled to begin last 
week at Chatsworth to erect a screen 20 feet above the existing 15-foot 
left-field fence. The purpose is to prevent home runs from rattling apartment 
windows across the street. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, there has not been so much as a delivery of a fence post. 
</P>
<P>
"I expressed displeasure about the whole thing," Lofrano said, "and requested 
that the job be done during spring break or at the end of the season." 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth is scheduled to open West Valley League play at home Tuesday against 
Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
Last add Chatsworth: Lofrano was selected head coach of a U. S. Baseball 
Federation high school all-star team that will travel to Seoul for the 
Friendship Series, Aug. 28 through Sept. 5. 
</P>
<P>
OK Corrales: Ask San Fernando Coach Steve Marden about the talents of senior 
shortstop Bobby Corrales, and Marden develops a bad case of amnesia. 
</P>
<P>
Corrales has made Marden forget all about his shortstop of last year, Albert 
Torres, an All-City selection who batted a school-record .514 in Mid-Valley 
League play. 
</P>
<P>
"Like I've been saying to anybody who'll listen, 'Albert Torres who?' " Marden 
quips. 
</P>
<P>
A few months ago, the same could be said of Corrales, who spent the first half 
of last season on the bench. A mid-season batting slump, however, prompted 
lineup changes and Corrales delivered as a designated-hitter (.371 average, 13 
RBIs). 
</P>
<P>
Corrales had a clutch grand slam against Granada Hills and later helped defeat 
Chatsworth in a 4-A semifinal with another home run. 
</P>
<P>
But Corrales' offense -- he was four for five and drove in five runs in the La 
Canada tournament championship victory over St. Francis -- is not the only 
reason he stands out, Marden insists. 
</P>
<P>
"He's improved so much with his glove that he's better right now than Albert 
was at the end of the season last year," Marden said.

POINT LOMA'S RALLY FALLS A POINT SHORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LINDGREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The scoreboard in the Los Angeles Sports Arena is high over center court, as is 
the case in many large arenas. Unless you look up, you can't see it from 
midcourt. 
</P>
<P>
Behind each basket along the upper-level seating is an auxiliary scoreboard. 
But if you are near midcourt heading toward the south basket, you can't see it 
because a large set of speakers hangs from the roof. 
</P>
<P>
Monica Filer couldn't see the clock as she drove down the court for what would 
be the final shot of Point Loma High's decade of girls' basketball dominance. 
</P>
<P>
It hardly seemed this would be of any significance earlier when Point Loma fell 
behind Morningside, 17-0, Saturday evening in the first 5 minutes of the 
Southern Regional Division I championship game. But with 11 seconds left, Filer 
grabbed a rebound and headed upcourt with a chance to win the game. 
</P>
<P>
Filer thought the end was near when she let loose a 28-foot shot that banged 
off the backboard and into the hands of JoJo Witherspoon, preserving a 45-44 
Morningside victory. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone but Filer saw that there had been 7 seconds left, plenty of time for 
the nifty point guard to drive and get a better shot, or maybe a pass. Filer 
had already broken the Division I championship game record for assists (nine) 
and had two three-pointers among her team-high 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
Said Filer, "I thought there was only 3 seconds left. I couldn't see the 
scoreboard overhead because I didn't want to look up. And I couldn't see the 
other one because there was something in the way." 
</P>
<P>
After the miss, Witherspoon held onto the ball around the free-throw line for 5 
seconds without anyone fouling her. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside, the top-seeded team and No. 2 in the nation according to USA 
Today, advanced to the state final next Saturday in the Oakland Coliseum 
against Oakland Fremont, a 50-47 winner over Orinde Miramonte in the Northern 
Regional final. 
</P>
<P>
For Point Loma to have a chance to win was nothing less than amazing. Of 
course, they have had some amazing moments in this tournament before. 
</P>
<P>
The Pointers (32-2) have won four state titles before bowing out last season in 
the semifinals of the San Diego Section playoffs. In the decade, Point Loma 
redefined the word dominance in San Diego girls' basketball, advancing to at 
least the section semifinals 10 consecutive years and never finishing with less 
than 22 victories in a season. 
</P>
<P>
But Morningside is awesome. And they proved it early. Led by 6-foot-5 Lisa 
Leslie, who scored a game-high 22 points despite sitting out almost a full 
quarter with four fouls, they rolled to that 17-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"Never. Never have I been that far down," said Lee Trepanier, Point Loma's 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
And then came the great comeback. Morningside led by just 30-27 at halftime and 
then trailed Point Loma, 36-30, with 2:24 left in the third quarter. The game 
was tied, 36-36, heading into the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
The lead changed hands for the eighth and final time on a turnaround eight-foot 
jump shot by Leslie with 55 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma was called for a double dribble violation with 27 seconds left and 
then fouled Witherspoon with 13 seconds left. Witherspoon missed the front end 
of the one-and-one, and Leslie missed a short shot off the offensive rebound. 
Filer took the rebound then missed the final shot. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a shot at them," Trepanier said. "We just needed to take it to the 
hole. They sure have a great team though, don't they?" 
</P>
<P>
Like the ones Trepanier has had for a decade.

JAPAN'S IZU PENINSULA IS UNDISCOVERED GEM

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Picture the French Riviera west of Cannes or St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands: 
colorful seaside villages against emerald hills, with windsurfers and fishing 
boats off the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
You can get the same view off Japan's Izu Peninsula, just two hours southeast 
of Tokyo by train. The hilly peninsula juts into the Pacific Ocean between 
Sagami Bay and Suruga Bay. 
</P>
<P>
More than 75% of the 500,000 Americans who went to Japan in 1986 visited Tokyo. 
The government says 37% went to historic Kyoto, 23% to bustling Osaka. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Tourists 
</P>
<P>
Few Americans visit Izu, however, so few that the government doesn't know how 
many. Figures show that only 2.5% of the 2 million foreign visitors reached 
Atami at the top of the peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
In all, about 2,000 foreigners a year get to Ito, a good base from which to see 
Izu. Fewer still reach Shimoda near the tip of Izu, where Commodore Matthew 
Calbraith Perry's ships opened feudal Japan to the West in 1854. 
</P>
<P>
Izu has outdoor hot spring baths called rotenburo, beautiful mountain and shore 
scenery, temples, spas, wild boar and crocodile parks, golf courses, quiet 
streams, fishing, scuba diving, sailing, skyline drives and little 
out-of-the-way seafood restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
At Izu, most beaches are of brown sand rather than white and the architecture 
is strictly Japanese. That means tranquillity, graceful architecture and few 
foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
Attractions range from the Ikeda 20th-Century Art Museum to the Atagawa Banana 
and Crocodile Gardens. The museum, a 25-minute car or bus ride from Ito, has 
about 600 paintings and sculptures by Matisse, Picasso, Chagall, Dali and 
others. The gardens at Atagawa Spa boast about 500 crocodiles of 25 species, 
all ugly. 
</P>
<P>
In Shimoda, with its palms and beaches, there's Hofukuji Temple, erected for 
the soul of Tojin Okichi, a mistress of Townsend Harris, the first American 
diplomat to Japan under the Tokugawa shogunate. The temple is a five-minute 
walk from Shimoda station; entry is about 200 yen. 
</P>
<P>
Amagi Boar Park, where animals roam freely, is a 15-minute drive from the 
Yugashima Spa near Mishima in central Izu. Boar meat, boiled or roasted and 
seasoned with bean paste, is served at ryokan at Amagi Hot Springs and is eaten 
with mushrooms, onions, radishes and mountain herbs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seaside Restaurant 
</P>
<P>
Izu has a little fish house between Ito and Shimoda, on the sea side of Route 
135, just past Shiradaonsenkyo. The restaurant has a long burl-wood table, 
stools and, by windows overlooking the sea, tatami and three low tables. 
</P>
<P>
For 3,500 yen (plus 500 yen for a big bottle of Sapporo beer) you can get 
steamed lobster, delicious sashimi, sea snail (not worth the trouble), rice and 
seafood custard. In Tokyo a meal like this costs twice as much. 
</P>
<P>
It's best to come to Izu by train; highways and local roads can get jammed in 
the summer season. A fast, comfortable Japan Rail electric train from Tokyo 
Station -- the Dancing Girl -- runs southeast past Yokohama, Odawara, Yugawara 
and out of the metropolis that extends to Sagami Bay. The fare to Ito is 1,300 
yen for a regular train and 2,100 yen for an express. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes before the 9 a.m. train to Ito left, I ducked out to a platform 
concession stand to bring back a boxed breakfast for 600 yen -- breaded chicken 
pieces, flavorful rice, a bit of salad and custard, along with chopsticks, 
salt, washcloth and salad dressing. 
</P>
<P>
As you head to Izu, the offices and apartments fade, sharply rising mountains 
appear on the right and the sea is on the left. 
</P>
<P>
Odawara is the final industrial town, about the last of greater Tokyo, Sony 
signs and factories. Once you reach Hayakawa you're in the country. But even in 
the suburbs you'll pass garden after garden with hoop-supported clear plastic 
over the rows. Solar panels seem to be on every fifth roof. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Out to the Mountains 
</P>
<P>
At Odawara station bright futon hang airing from apartment balconies. From 
there the train goes into a tunnel for 10 seconds and then into storybook Alps. 
On the left, beyond little houses, is blue ocean. Two tunnels later the route 
runs along the shore, with more mountains in the distance and white, 
gaff-rigged fishing boats, nets and pine trees at the steeply falling shore. 
</P>
<P>
At the Yugawara elevated station at 10:20 a.m., you're almost surrounded by 
mountains, their steep sides manicured for terraced farming. 
</P>
<P>
When you reach Ajiro at 10:45 a.m. you can see the perfect seaside town. 
Mountains rise from the bay with colorful houses at the base and in places up 
the slopes. Usami, separated from Ajiro by a mountain and just north of Ito, 
seems Caribbean, smaller, with a higher mountain. Surfboarders ride off the 
beach despite minimal waves, and teen-agers lounge by a surf shop as wet suits 
dry in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
The new cabs from Ito station cost an initial 460 yen; the ride up to our hotel 
was 2,060 yen. The white-gloved cab drivers spoke no English; we handed the 
driver the name of our hotel in Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
The cab goes up, past the fish and seafood stalls and the Ito Youth Hostel, and 
climbs into the Amagi Mountains. Thank goodness Japanese roads have mirrors at 
blind curves. On the switchback roads, they're absolutely necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Hotels abound. Rates at ryokan range from 8,000 to 30,000 yen per person a 
night with two meals. Minshuku, private houses that take in guests, are 
cheaper, but usually found only in fishing villages in south and west Izu. The 
Japanese Tourist Office by the Hybia subway station in Tokyo or in major 
American cities should be able to make arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
After renting a car and adapting to driving on the left, we stopped to walk on 
the beach at a fishing village on the way to Shimoda. There couldn't have been 
more than 20 houses, most stucco or rough wood, with traditional tile roofs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Life in the Village 
</P>
<P>
Near the beach, children played with white plastic kites and young men in a 
white-and-blue Jeep unloaded windsurfers and wet suits. Five scuba divers, 
older men, were climbing out of the ocean as the children arrived. Later, one 
of the men soaked in a hot outdoor pool just off the beach. Steaming water ran 
to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
On the rocks a woman and two young children searched for shells. A fishing boat 
lay at anchor about a quarter of a mile offshore, nets strung out. Trays of 
fresh-caught fish were drying nearby under screens propped up to the sun on 
Coca-Cola boxes. 
</P>
<P>
Streets were narrow. Birds sang from an elderly pine; there was no other sound. 
The houses were open to the street, with rows of shoes inside open doorways, 
and several upper windows were draped with full clotheslines. Pools of 
beautiful flowers formed haphazard gardens. 
</P>
<P>
Later that evening, after missing dinner at the hotel, I drove a few miles to 
find that Izu closes early. But two small dogs outside the open door of a 
restaurant on Route 135 drew my attention. The menu and wall signs were in 
Japanese and no one spoke English, but the old woman there understood my 
request for sashimi, kudasai. 
</P>
<P>
 A tray with slices of fresh tuna, other fish and bits of a spiral-shell 
mollusk, miso with seaweed, veggies, rice and tea cost 1,500 yen. There were 
low, polished tables and cushions. The restaurant, with sliding paper doors, 
was tasteful and simple. 
</P>
<P>
We drove in the other direction the next day, north along the coast on Route 
135, past the Ito train station toward Tokyo. Giant jagged rocks bulge from the 
ocean a few hundred feet offshore. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seaside View 
</P>
<P>
In Usami we stopped in the Seaside Resort Pension for lunch. It looks like New 
England, all white with bay windows and a white porch. From those windows we 
could see fishing boats coming in and men drying nets. 
</P>
<P>
A woman on the radio introduced a record by Paul Revere and the Raiders, but 
the 20-ish waitress spoke no English. I asked for ahi. Then meguro. Then tuna. 
Nothing. We wrote it down. Nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Elayne, my wife, said: "Hamburger?" The waitress' eyes brightened. "Feelin' 
Groovy" came on the FM station from Yokohama. 
</P>
<P>
On a small lake near the hotel we rented a rowboat for 90 yen and went out to 
tiny islands, past fishermen and families in other rowboats and paddle boats 
made up as white turtles and yellow swans. 
</P>
<P>
Later, at a lake-shore souvenir shop, we were looking at cards when I found an 
old folder of pressed leaves. When I asked how much, the woman didn't 
understand my accent. She called over a girl about 16. 
</P>
<P>
"It's old; it's a present to you," the girl said and smiled when she learned we 
were from Chicago. She had spent a year in Racine, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
Riding back to Tokyo after the weekend, we knew we were leaving the country 
when little houses gave way in Takada to a giant factory and high-rise 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>

ENCOUNTERING ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON ON SAMOA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS HILGERS, Hilgers is a free-lance writer living in Honolulu. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
APIA, Western Samoa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every visitor to this island has at least one encounter with Robert Louis 
Stevenson. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it is through his words, quoted in a travel book: "Time flies in the 
enjoyment of every pleasure which an islander conceives." Perhaps it is through 
a would-be guide on the steps of the Aggie Grey Hotel who offers to take you to 
Vailima, the home that Stevenson loved. 
</P>
<P>
Or it may be through the name of capital city Apia's newest hotel, Tusitala. 
Tusitala, "teller of tales," was the title by which Stevenson became known in 
his adopted land. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the author or "Treasure Island" and "Kidnapped" remains someone 
special in Samoa. 
</P>
<P>
Certain facts of Stevenson's life are less frequently recalled, however. 
</P>
<P>
It was his health, not a love of Polynesia, that drove Stevenson, who suffered 
all his life from tuberculosis, to the South Seas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fast-Talking American 
</P>
<P>
Samoa became his final home not by choice but because of a fast-talking 
American trader who stood to gain from the sale of "314 1/2 acres of beautiful 
land in the bush." 
</P>
<P>
In 1889, after he'd first arrived, Stevenson wrote to a friend: "Samoa, Apia at 
least, is far less beautiful than the Marquesas or Tahiti." 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson spent his final years living on Upolu; his estate, Vailima, is now 
the official residence of the nation's head of state. 
</P>
<P>
The grave of the author lies at the summit of Mt. Vaea, a spectacular peak that 
overlooks plunging green valleys, sparkling lagoons and the Tusitala Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Like his famous character, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Stevenson may have lived a 
bit of a double life. But he was not the only outsider from whom Samoa called 
forth mixed reactions. 
</P>
<P>
Nineteenth-Century Christian missionaries found the people welcoming but 
warlike, and sought to change the latter. In the process, they wrested for the 
Christian minister or priest some of the powers once held only by traditional 
family chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Independent Trust 
</P>
<P>
But Western colonial overlords found the Western Samoans anything but welcoming 
as subjects. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Germans and the New Zealanders had to contend with Mau a Pule, a 
resistance movement that heralded fa'a Samoa, native Samoan ways. Not by 
accident, Western Samoa was the first Pacific trust to win independent nation 
status. 
</P>
<P>
What Stevenson knew well by the time of his death in 1894 was the source of 
Samoans' apparent vacillation. It is not a dislike of outsiders. Rather, 
Samoans simply love political intrigues, whether they involve contending 
brothers, chiefs or foreign nations. 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson also knew firsthand of the familylike bonds with which Samoan people 
often embrace outsiders, from another village or another country. 
</P>
<P>
What Stevenson didn't know was the awesome beauty of the island of Upolu, for 
the fragile man didn't venture much beyond Vailima, Apia and the villages 
between. 
</P>
<P>
What Stevenson couldn't have known is how little life in Western Samoa would 
change. Today you'll see some television antennas in the capital city, pointed 
toward transmitters 80 miles away in American Samoa. 
</P>
<P>
But much of Upolu, the country's most populated island, is unpaved and without 
electricity. In many areas you can still see life as Stevenson wrote of it 
nearly 100 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The most common tour on Upolu goes to the south side of the island from Apia, 
past Vailima and then over what Stevenson described as "the backbone of the 
island, with "wild pigs and cattle, and wild doves and flying foxes, and many 
particolored birds, and many black, and many white: a very eerie, dim, strange 
place and hard to travel." 
</P>
<P>
The journey is less "strange" than exotic. With a paved road it is no longer 
hard. The standard tour continues on to Lafaga Beach, where Gary Cooper swam in 
"Return to Paradise." It's a beautiful beach, and many visitors go no farther. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alternate Journey 
</P>
<P>
An alternate journey, if you have a full day and if the weather has been 
relatively dry, is a drive to southeastern Upolu and Cape Tapaga. 
</P>
<P>
The quickest road to old Samoa leaves Apia just beyond Aggie Grey's, where the 
main road turns right. There, a couple of roadside stands can furnish the 
juices and tonics that tourists may not be able to find farther along. 
</P>
<P>
The paved oceanside road moves between the glowing greens of tropical foliage 
and the quiet thunder of distant breakers on the fringes of the turquoise 
lagoon. Here and there the forest has been tamed, and neatly clipped lawns mark 
the typical small village. 
</P>
<P>
Here a house is an open fale (fah-lay), a circle or oval of poles that support 
a raised roof and a thatched or tin peaked roof. 
</P>
<P>
Many villages include a small store, which may sell flashlight batteries and 
tinned biscuits. Some stores abut ramshackle pool halls where young males 
gather to escape the sun. 
</P>
<P>
But the dominant structure in every village is a church, or several churches. 
The different sizes and decorations signal another level of political intrigue. 
</P>
<P>
It's nice to break this drive with a swim at the beach behind Piula College, 
just beyond the village of Lufilufi, about 14 miles east of Apia. 
</P>
<P>
Watch for the shell of a large Gothic church along the ocean. When you park 
your car on the grass a Methodist seminarian collects a small service fee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pool in the Lava Rocks 
</P>
<P>
Swimming in the shadow of a Samoan church sounds romantic enough, but there's 
more. Here you can choose between the ocean and a tingly-cold, freshwater pool 
that has been carved out of lava and rocks at the ocean's edge. After your 
swim, enjoy your papaya juice in the shade of the nearby fale. 
</P>
<P>
The road beyond Lufilufi moves inland, and soon becomes gravel and then 
hardened earth. Rain forest plants canopy the road near Lemafa Pass, a saddle 
with stunning views of misty volcanic peaks. The mountain air is heavy with the 
fragrance of white and yellow ginger. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the lookout at Lemafa Pass, cars are very few, and road signs 
nonexistent. Several waterfalls are a short hike off the road. You find them by 
looking for telltale mists. 
</P>
<P>
About five miles beyond the pass the dirt road forks. The left branch continues 
south and after three miles arrives at the oceanside village of Lotofaga. 
</P>
<P>
Continue east over the sand and dirt road. In this almost untouched paradise 
boys carry bananas from their village plantations, fishermen cart home their 
catches from the reef, tethered horses munch abundant grass and women do 
laundry in streams. 
</P>
<P>
Smoke rises slowly from some of the cooking fales; now and then men prepare a 
pig for roasting in an earthen oven, an umu. And you will be followed 
everywhere by groups of bright-eyed children, all laughing, waving and singing, 
" 'Bye, 'bye palagi (foreigner)!" 
</P>
<P>
It can be a little disconcerting to pass through village after village and be 
greeted by welcoming smiles and " 'bye 'bye." But here words, like time, take 
on different meanings. 
</P>
<P>
To these children, " 'bye-'bye" is an attempt to talk to you in your own 
language, a display of the warmth with which Samoans treat guests. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meandering Road 
</P>
<P>
The road to Cape Tapaga allows nothing faster than meandering. At times it may 
permit even less: If there has been heavy rain in the mountains, what was a 
little stream can cut the road in two. 
</P>
<P>
If you have to turn around, remember that in Samoa, nature still makes the 
rules. If you can continue to the cape, you'll know better what "Polynesian" 
means. 
</P>
<P>
The northeast corner of Upolu has no road. So you can either return to Apia as 
you came, or drive north from Lotofaga about three miles to the fork and turn 
left. 
</P>
<P>
The latter course, over mostly packed dirt road, will carry you through lush 
plantation groves to paved Tiavi Road, which leads back past Vailima to Apia. 
</P>
<P>
In Apia, both the Tusitala, with 96 modern rooms, and the Aggie Grey's 120 
rooms offer fine accommodations, with Aggie's rooms having irons and built-in 
ironing boards, in proper colonial fashion. 
</P>
<P>
But if you prefer a real getaway, consider the Hideaway Hotel, with 30 rooms on 
the south shore, just a little west of Tiavi Road. There two can sleep in an 
enclosed fale on the beach for 67 tala (about $34 U.S.). Smaller hotels are the 
Vaiala Beach Cottages, Harbour Lights and the Seaside Inn. Some feature 
kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
Samoa sings a siren song, more perhaps today than in Stevenson's day. But I 
hope not too many palagi will hear the call. They may spoil things. 
</P>

YOUTH BEAT: BUDGET TRIPS IN BRITAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON, Izon is a Canadian travel journalist covering youth budget 
routes. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Travelers on tight funds can arrange visits to Great Britain at rock-bottom 
rates through the Canadian Hostelling Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Budget packages for independent travelers include six nights in Britain (three 
in London) for less than $80 U.S. and seven nights in Scotland (transportation 
included) for less than $112. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Canadian dollar is worth less than the U.S. dollar, depending on the 
rate of exchange, you should save about 20% when you convert the package prices 
to American dollars. 
</P>
<P>
One budget package includes confirmed dormitory accommodations for three nights 
in London's Hampstead Heath youth hostel, vouchers for three nights at any of 
the 300 British youth hostels outside London and a "Countdown" discount card 
that's valid in Britain and Europe. Arrangements must be made 10 days in 
advance. It costs $99 Canadian (about $79 U.S.). 
</P>
<P>
London has seven internationally affiliated youth hostels. Guests don't need 
reservations, but the hostels do tend to fill up by breakfast time each day. 
Several impose midnight curfews and most lock their doors during the day. 
</P>
<P>
A second package offers one night of confirmed accommodations in a London 
hostel, vouchers for six nights at other British hostels and a 30-day 
BritExpress Card. This card is valid for a 33% discount on National Express and 
Scottish Citylink bus services. The package price is $89 Canadian. 
</P>
<P>
You can explore Scotland using another package that includes a seven-day 
Scotland Citylink Bus Pass, valid for unlimited travel throughout Scotland and 
the Isle of Skye, plus vouchers for six nights of hostel accommodations, a map, 
bus timetable, hostel handbook and a pass for visiting heritage sites. You must 
travel between April 1 and Sept. 30. The cost is $137 Canadian. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
And Eastern Europe 
</P>
<P>
Packages for independent travelers are also available for those who want to 
visit Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Solo travelers can get seven nights of accommodations, with breakfast, in East 
Germany, sharing four-bed rooms (separate for men and women) in any combination 
of East Berlin, Dresden, Erfurt and Leipzig. There is a maximum stay of three 
nights at any one location. 
</P>
<P>
Couples can usually be provided with a twin-bed room. This must be booked 35 
days in advance. The price is $198 Canadian. 
</P>
<P>
Student and youth travel agencies in Vienna offer budget-priced packages for 
individuals who want to visit Budapest. You can also make arrangements before 
you leave North America. The Canadian Hostelling Assn. offers packages that 
include five nights' accommodations in four-bed rooms in a student hotel, plus 
vouchers for five lunches or dinners, for $72 Canadian. 
</P>
<P>
Couples can have three nights' accommodations in a two-star hotel in Budapest, 
with breakfast, for $39 Canadian per person. 
</P>
<P>
The association also offers packages for budget-priced stopovers in Iceland. 
You get three nights of accommodations in a youth hostel in the capital of 
Reykjavik, a return ferry trip to Vestmannaeyjar Island with a night's hostel 
lodging, and a bus tour to Gullfoss and Geysir with another night at a hostel. 
This package is available between June 9 and Aug. 21 and costs $179 Canadian. 
</P>
<P>
The trips are designed for travelers between 18 and 40 but there are no age 
restrictions, just that you be "young at heart." You must, however, be a member 
of a national youth hostel association. 
</P>
<P>
You can get more details on the Canadian association's tours by contacting 
Aventours, 1600 James Naismith Drive, Gloucester, Ottawa, Ont., Canada K1B 5N4, 
(613) 748-5725. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, STI Travel, a California-based youth tour operator, has announced 
that it will include China in its 1989 tour program. The new 22-day tour for 
18- to 30-year-olds visits the Great Wall, Beijing, Xian, Guilin, Suzhou, 
Shanghai and Qufu, the birthplace of Confucius. A cruise on the Li Jian River 
is also included. 
</P>
<P>
Rates range from $2,895 to $2,975. To obtain STI's new 52-page brochure, 
contact STI Inc., 8619 Reseda Blvd., Suite 103, Northridge 91324, toll-free 
(800) 637-7687 (California) or (800) 225-2788 (out of state), or (818) 
886-0633.

TRAVELING IN ITALY ON A SLOW BOAT TO VENICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERNIE BOOKBINDER, Bookbinder is a senior editor at Newsday in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
VENICE, Italy 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is nothing unusual about approaching this city by water. Almost every 
visitor does. But arriving at the "Pearl of the Adriatic" via the Brenta Canal 
can provide both the perfect end to a delightful day and an extraordinary 
introduction to one of the world's most fascinating cities. 
</P>
<P>
Reaching Venice is indeed a bonus, the final lap of a daylong excursion 
originating in the bustling city of Padua. 
</P>
<P>
The trip is accomplished aboard Il Burchiello, the modern version of a 
17th-Century vessel that was rowed and towed more than 20 miles along the 
picturesque waterway separating Padua and Venice. 
</P>
<P>
The powered boat contains bar and bathroom and seats 70 passengers, most of 
them comfortably in a windowed cabin, a few alfresco in portable, unpadded 
plastic chairs. 
</P>
<P>
The trip, which operates between April and October, can be made in either 
direction: Il Burchiello leaves Padua on Sundays, Wednesdays and Fridays and 
Venice on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
The fare of 90,000 lire (about $75 U.S.) includes a bus ticket back to the 
departure point, a lunch and the services of a multilingual guide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Magnificent Villas 
</P>
<P>
It also includes entrance fees to three magnificent villas that are visited en 
route. While most passengers went round trip, some took their luggage along (no 
extra charge) and used the tour as an innovative way to reach Venice. 
</P>
<P>
Traveling on the Brenta is like boating on a meandering river, although the 
resemblance is interrupted periodically by locks that on the Padua-to-Venice 
route deposit the boat gently at a lower level. 
</P>
<P>
The guide spoke over a semi-audible, public-address system in Italian, French, 
German and English. She said the locks were invented by Leonardo da Vinci, but 
it was not clear whether she was talking about the Brenta locks or all locks. 
</P>
<P>
The journey occasionally slowed while a variety of ingeniously designed bridges 
were swung, raised or drawn to permit Il Burchiello's passage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nature's Backdrop 
</P>
<P>
These mechanical contrivances provided an interesting counterpoint as the boat 
cruised slowly through lush meadows, ripe vineyards, silvery-green olive 
orchards and fields bright with yellow sunflowers. 
</P>
<P>
Although cars frequently passed noisily on a highway close to the canal, our 
sense of serenity returned quickly with a glimpse of a primitive farmhouse, a 
herd of goats or friendly waves from solitary fishermen along the grassy banks. 
</P>
<P>
But the primary object of the trip is to visit the villas, extravagant examples 
of architectural splendor from the 17th and 18th centuries and which were 
suburban retreats for Venetian and Paduan nobility. 
</P>
<P>
First stop on the eastward trip, reached after about an hour, was Villa 
Nazionale (also called Villa Pisani), a legendary estate once occupied for one 
night by Napoleon, and was the retrospectively infamous site of the first 
meeting between Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sumptuous Showplace 
</P>
<P>
With its vast grounds, ponds, fountains, gardens, statuary and stables, the 
huge mansion could easily qualify as one of the most sumptuous showplaces on 
Long Island's Gold Coast. 
</P>
<P>
The outside beauty and grandeur was matched by the interior, a lavish 
collection of magnificently decorated rooms that provided an extraordinary look 
into another time and place. 
</P>
<P>
The builder apparently had unlimited resources to baroque artists such as 
Tiepolo, whose "Apotheosis of the Pisani Family" decorated one of the rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Striking murals and stunning ceilings were well maintained. One had little 
difficulty imagining Napoleon retiring imperially to his canopied bed in his 
ornately chandeliered bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
The interior has resisted the passing of time better than several of the 
outbuildings, which could use some sprucing up. Deception plays a significant 
role both inside and out, with trompe l'oeil, a maze and an impressive facade 
that conceals stables. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Reserved Seats' 
</P>
<P>
As the cruise resumed, Il Burchiello sluiced through the green water. The guide 
resumed her multilingual litany. Other villas popped into view around bends in 
the canal, through hedges, behind stone fences and wrought-iron gates. 
</P>
<P>
At Mira Porte we stopped to visit a 16th-Century villa that has been restored 
by an art professor named Tiozzo, who occupies it with his family. The frescoes 
he restored, once hidden by lime and grime, look as if they had just been 
painted. 
</P>
<P>
Contemporary furniture blends with Renaissance walls and ceilings to create a 
timeless sense of beauty. 
</P>
<P>
Tours of the two villas and the boat ride have stimulated appetites that were 
appeased in a bright and airy waterside restaurant called, appropriately, Il 
Burchiello. 
</P>
<P>
Tiny freshwater clams, other seafood and unlimited bottles of local wine 
refreshed and fortified us for the remainder of the trip. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Isolation in Style 
</P>
<P>
After lunch the pleasant journey continued at a relaxed pace, and our guide 
prepared us for an encounter with Andrea Palladio, the dean of Italian 
Renaissance architecture who designed Villa Malcontenta. The provocative name 
derived from its being built on a remote site to isolate a lady of the wealthy 
Foscari family, who was "malcontent" with her lot. 
</P>
<P>
Its elegant style has attracted royalty since 1560; King Henry III, Ferdinand 
II and Queen Elizabeth II stayed there. 
</P>
<P>
Late afternoon descended when Il Burchiello departed Malcontenta for Venice. As 
the boat left the mainland at Fusina and passed the pollution and industrial 
waste that poured out of the port and refinery city of Mestre, and as the smoke 
and smog and workaday world receded, ahead lay the exotic skyline of Venice: 
the Campanile, the dome of Santa Maria della Saute, the Basilica San Marco. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly it was sunset. The scene lasted for 10 or 15 minutes as the crimson 
sun burned through the haze and illuminated the low clouds with streaks of pink 
and purple. 
</P>
<P>
And then Il Burchiello headed for its pier near the world-famous Piazza San 
Marco, the soul of this fairy-tale city of palaces and canals. As we crossed 
the mouth of the fabled Grand Canal we were surrounded by boats: tankers, 
yachts, ferries, gondolas, kayaks, vaporetti. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
In Padua the Plaza at Corso Milano 40, with double, bath and breakfasts, costs 
$125 U.S. a night. Leon Bianco, Piazzetta Pedrocchi 12, double with bath and 
breakfast, is $70. 
</P>
<P>
Notable restaurants: El Toula, Via Velle Parti 11. Dinner for two with wine is 
$55. Il Michelangelo, Corso Milan 22, is moderate, with dinner for two plus 
wine costing $45. 
</P>
<P>
Stocco, Via dei Colli 164, is inexpensive. Dinner for two with wine is $25.

FOOTLOOSE ON CAPE COD: COASTING ALONG 300 MILES OF SUMMERTIME FUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
CHATHAM, Mass. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cape Cod's 70 miles protrudes into the Atlantic Ocean like an arm flexing its 
biceps, the leisurely and sparsely settled north shore sprinkled with homes of 
old-time sea captains, the more contemporary south a maze of shopping malls, 
condos and summer traffic. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, 300 miles of coast, more than 350 lakes and ponds and excellent 
beaches and harbor facilities are keeping Cape Cod a summer vacationland. 
</P>
<P>
Surely among its 15 towns and 70 villages you'll find a spot along the shores 
-- Nantucket Sound or Cape Cod Bay -- to suit your idea of a pleasant vacation. 
</P>
<P>
Getting here: Fly United, USAir, American, TWA, Delta or Northwest to Boston, 
regional airlines from there to Hyannis on the cape. There's also regular bus 
and train service from Boston to Hyannis. 
</P>
<P>
How long/how much? Vacations usually run a week or so, some families visiting 
for the entire summer. You'll find accommodations and dining at every price 
level, but generally very moderate. 
</P>
<P>
A few fast facts: Best time for a visit is late May until mid-October. Indian 
summers are glorious. It takes about two hours to drive the length of the cape. 
And water on the Atlantic and Nantucket Sound side is warmer for swimming. 
</P>
<P>
Getting settled in: Shoreway Acres (Shore Street, Falmouth; $65 to $95 B&amp;B 
double) is a sprawling complex of 19th-Century seafarer's homes and more modern 
buildings on a tree-lined street in Falmouth at the southwest end of the cape. 
Shoreway is a family-oriented place, with indoor and outdoor pools, plenty of 
lawns and garden, and a more-than-generous buffet breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
Prices vary. Some accommodations are two rooms suitable for four adults, others 
have refrigerators or full kitchens. This is a very relaxed place and a short 
walk to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
The Inn at Fernbrook (481 Main St., Centerville; $115-$125 B&amp;B double) is a 
century-old Victorian set on 17 acres with gardens and ponds. Several rooms 
have four-posters and functioning fireplaces. The house was built with no two 
bedrooms sharing a common wall, assuring privacy. 
</P>
<P>
What they do share is a feeling of opulence, with cherry, maple and oak floors, 
Oriental carpets, handsome furnishings, plus a few books and a decanter of 
sherry in each room or suite. Breakfast in the formal dining room could be 
fresh juice, Irish soda bread, eggs Benedict, espresso or cafe au lait. 
</P>
<P>
The Green Harbor Motor Lodge (Ascapesket Road, East Falmouth; $74-$76 summer, 
$56-$60 September-October) is a contemporary place on one of the small inlets 
of the south coast. It has a pool, a boating pier and a broad water-side lawn. 
More expensive rooms, studios and cottages have kitchenettes and fireplaces. 
</P>
<P>
Regional food and drink: Cape Cod offers plenty of fresh seafood and 
exceptional clam chowder. Provincetown's Lobster Pot restaurant has won the 
Chowder Bowl trophy four years in a row, with the Windjammer Lounge in Hyannis 
a close second. 
</P>
<P>
Portuguese dishes abound at the Lobster Pot, including hearty kale soup and a 
Portuguese version of chowder with garlic and herbs. Marvelous pastries and 
breads. 
</P>
<P>
Good dining: Mattakeese Wharf (Barnstable Harbor) is built on piling at 
dockside. It's a pretty place where you can dine inside or under blue and white 
canvas beside the water. You might start with baked stuffed quahogs, mussels 
Dijon or bay scallops en brochette. Then try king crab meat au gratin, 
crab-stuffed haddock or lobster. 
</P>
<P>
Christian's (443 Main St., Chatham) is an old home turned into a delightful 
restaurant. You'll find a chevre cheese topped with Westphalian ham and 
sun-dried tomatoes, then wrapped in grape leaves and grilled. 
</P>
<P>
Christian's littleneck clams are lightly baked, flavored with butter, garlic, 
herbs and spices. And there's an upstairs with a less-expensive pub menu such 
as you'll never find in Britain, unless you know of one that skewers scallops, 
shrimp and swordfish marinated in ginger, lime and tamari, then grills the lot. 
</P>
<P>
Flying Bridge, Portofino Room (220 Scranton Ave., Falmouth) offers the best of 
all possible combinations: an elegant and outstanding Northern Italian 
restaurant, access to the finest seafood, and total mastery in the kitchen and 
service. 
</P>
<P>
Dine inside or on a balcony over Falmouth Inner Harbor on a first course of 
penne alla vodka (sauteed with fresh tomato, basil, vodka, prosciutto and a 
touch of cream) or fettuccine di funghi con sugo de noce (mushroom fettuccine 
with walnut sauce). Then choose from lobster with mussels sauteed in a creamed 
saffron and white wine sauce, or red snapper with tarragon. 
</P>
<P>
Going first-class: The Chatham Bars Inn (Shore Road, Chatham; $230-$290 double, 
including breakfasts and dinners) was built in 1914, with the Cape Cod-style 
main inn considered a New England landmark. 
</P>
<P>
Separate cottages have been added along with a golf course, a pool and five 
all-weather tennis courts on the 80-acre property. Public rooms in the main inn 
have a comfortably informal air, with white wicker furniture, flowery prints 
and lush carpets before the fireplaces. 
</P>
<P>
The menu in a pretty dining room gives you several choices for a five-course 
dinner, all part of your room price. And the food, if rather straightforward in 
selection, is prepared and served with style. 
</P>
<P>
On your own: For a look at the old Cape Cod of gray-shake cottages and stately 
homes, drive U.S. 6A along the Cape Cod Bay side, spending as much time as 
possible in and around the village of Sandwich. It's the cape's oldest town and 
one of the best preserved. 
</P>
<P>
Sandwich also has a water-powered grist mill dating from 1690 on a pond near 
the village green, a beautiful church inspired by Christopher Wren, the old 
Parish Meeting House established by Pilgrims in 1638 and a Thornton W. Burgess 
Museum (he wrote "Peter Rabbit") that has a daily story time in summer for 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Chatham, on the west end of Nantucket Sound, is our idea of a perfect vacation 
spot, with almost 20 miles of beaches, a delightful Main Street with shops and 
good restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
For more information: Call the Cape Cod Chamber of Commerce at (617) 362-3225, 
or write (Routes 6 &amp; 132, Hyannis, Mass. 02601) for an 80-page resort 
directory with map, hotels, restaurants and things to do. You can also call New 
England USA toll-free at (800) VISIT-NE for brochures on all six New England 
states.

IN LOVE WITH ST. GALLEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SHIRLEY, Shirley is a free-lance writer living in San Diego and former 
sports editor of The Times.

<P>
ST. GALLEN, Switzerland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have had a love affair with Switzerland since 1971. Of the 40 countries I 
have visited since, it is my favorite. I like its mountains, villages, trains, 
chocolate, small hotels, pure clean air -- and you can drink its water. 
</P>
<P>
At first I was a typical tourist, visiting all the popular Swiss stops: Geneva, 
Lausanne, Lucerne, Montreux, Zermatt, Interlaken, St. Moritz. Then I found such 
gems as Grindelwald, Wengen, Lauterbrunnen, Saas Fee, Arosa, Locarno and 
Ascona. 
</P>
<P>
Now I have discovered St. Gallen, the capital of the little-known region of 
eastern Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
At an altitude of 2,200 feet in a lush, green valley between Lake Constance and 
8,200-foot Mt. Santis, St. Gallen is an hour's train ride from the Zurich 
airport and 2 hours, 20 minutes from Munich. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Restored Homes 
</P>
<P>
Give it at least two days. You will need one day to explore the Altstadt, or 
old town. Its narrow, winding streets, many of which are reserved for 
pedestrians, are lined with attractive little shops and quaint old houses 
splendidly restored. Their turrets, bay windows and carved wooden balconies are 
peculiar to this part of Switzerland and southern Germany. 
</P>
<P>
On the second day take a 45-minute train ride to Appenzell, a charming village 
of painted buildings and narrow streets, where the Alpine scenery reminds you 
more of the rest of Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, good skiing is available near the village, but on a recent cold, 
overcast day the mountains had only a light dusting of snow and the ski lifts 
were shut down in one of Switzerland's mildest winters in memory. 
</P>
<P>
If bad weather knocks out a visit to Appenzell, take a train to Zurich (about 
$20 U.S.) from where you can catch another train for a day's excursion to many 
of Switzerland's choicest pieces of real estate. Lake Constance is only 15 
minutes away, as is Bregenz, Austria, and its casino. 
</P>
<P>
Why St. Gallen is so unfamiliar, even to the natives of Basel, Geneva and Bern 
is a mystery. It has been around since AD 612, when an itinerant Irish monk 
named Gallus found the area attractive and settled here. 
</P>
<P>
By the 8th Century Gallus' hermit cell had developed first into a monastery and 
then into the Benedictine Abbey of St. Gall. 
</P>
<P>
In 1805 the abbey was abolished but its magnificent baroque buildings remained. 
They are the feature attraction of the old quarter. The cathedral's 
architecture is so impressive that UNESCO put it on its list of the world's 
chief cultural monuments. 
</P>
<P>
Even more impressive than the cathedral, however, is the abbey's library. To 
the Swiss this richly molded, elaborately ornate building, completed in 1767, 
has the most beautiful rococo interior on any side of the Alps. 
</P>
<P>
The library is a magnificent room, 94 feet long, 32 feet wide and 24 feet high. 
An intricately designed inlaid floor of walnut, fir and cherry gleams in the 
light shining through 34 windows. Visitors must wear slippers over shoes to 
walk on the library's floor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Library Treasures 
</P>
<P>
Baroque furnishings and ceiling frescoes aside, the library treasures are its 
800 biblical and liturgical manuscripts (out of 2,000 brought here by Gallus 
and other monks) and 100,000 leather-bound books that have survived fire, wars 
and theft for more than 200 years. 
</P>
<P>
The priceless manuscripts were beautifully handwritten as early as the 6th 
Century by creative artists among the monks. Some are illuminated. They inspire 
reverence, and after seeing them one can better understand the Greek 
inscription over the entrance to the library: "The Healing Place for the Soul." 
</P>
<P>
With the decline of the dollar, a visitor to St. Gallen during the Christmas 
holidays found prices that reminded him of New York City, London and Paris. 
</P>
<P>
A lunch of bratwurst, French fries and a glass of wine cost $14. In a small 
Italian restaurant a dinner of veal, a small side dish of spaghetti and a 
quarter liter of wine cost $26. No salad, no dessert, no coffee. 
</P>
<P>
A fondue lunch for two, with a small bottle of local wine at the Hecht Hotel in 
Appenzell, cost $35. Simple dinners, salad, veal or tafelspitz (delicious 
boiled beef), potatoes and half a liter of wine, costs up to $65 for two. 
</P>
<P>
A fixed-price dinner for two without wine was $90 at St. Gallen's Einstein 
Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it costs less to visit St. Gallen and Appenzell than the popular resorts 
of central Switzerland and the Bernese Oberland. 
</P>
<P>
The Swiss towns also are cheaper than Munich, Salzburg and Vienna, where double 
rooms in such luxury hotels as the Hilton and Sheraton can cost as much as $250 
to $300. 
</P>
<P>
Double rooms with bath at the little Hecht Hotel in Appenzell cost about $95, 
including breakfast, tax and service. It is small and central. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deluxe Hotels 
</P>
<P>
Einstein, one of four hotels classified as deluxe in St. Gallen, has 65 
immaculate rooms with spacious modern baths. A member of the Movenpick-Radisson 
chain, it is just a few steps from the old quarter and half a mile from the 
railroad station. 
</P>
<P>
The manager, Jurg Studer, has given "The Little Grand Hotel" some nice touches. 
Bathrooms have hair dryers and large heated bath towels. Linen towels are 
placed on the floor by beds at night. A bowl of fresh fruit is placed in the 
lobby for guests every evening. 
</P>
<P>
Like most Swiss hotels the Einstein has one of the best restaurants in town. It 
is on the top (fifth) floor and overlooks the old quarter. 
</P>
<P>
A double room in January went for about $165 U.S. Breakfast was not included. 
</P>
<P>
Other deluxe hotels in St. Gallen are the Metropol and Walhalla, both near the 
railroad station, and the Santispark. 
</P>
<P>

National Tourist Office, 250 Stockton St., San Francisco 94108, phone (415) 
362-2260.

THE SAVVY TRAVELER: SECURITY INCREASED AT AIRPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER S. GREENBERG, Greenberg is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not long ago two Northwest Airlines gate agents walked up a jet-way at the 
Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton airport in Pennsylvania. They were preparing to 
close out a late-night DC-9 flight to Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly two men jumped out from around the corner, forced them onto the plane 
and announced that they were hijacking the flight. 
</P>
<P>
Five-and-a-half hours later the ordeal was over. But it had all been staged by 
FBI agents as an exercise in terrorism and negotiation, part of a series of 
mock hijackings that the FBI has been conducting at airlines around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
But that's just the start. In the wake of the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over 
Scotland, airlines, airports and governments are moving quickly to implement 
new security measures and new detection and scanning devices. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plastic-Bomb Detectors 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the Pan Am incident in December, the Federal Aviation 
Administration accelerated its order for six machines that can detect plastic 
explosives. 
</P>
<P>
In Greece the government has stepped up its counterterrorist initiative. A 
special Greek Coast Guard unit has been assigned to protect cruise ships in the 
port of Piraeus, near Athens, and throughout the Greek islands. At the Athens 
airport all luggage is hand-searched, then sealed before check-in. 
</P>
<P>
In Rome, airport officials no longer allow friends or relatives of passengers 
into the airport building. Airport officials in Paris are training a new army 
of explosive-sniffing dogs. 
</P>
<P>
In the Middle East armed guards now fly on all Royal Jordanian flights. And in 
Cairo, after passengers check in their baggage the bags are lined up outside 
the plane on the tarmac. Then, before passengers are allowed to board the 
plane, they have to identify each of their bags before they are loaded onto the 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
In France the civil aviation agency has announced funding for two advanced 
weapon-detection systems for checked baggage and cargo containers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New ID Cards 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the agency is issuing new identification cards with special 
magnetic information strips to all workers at French airports, at a cost of $17 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The new French scanner systems are designed to measure emissions from a source 
installed on the other side of a moving baggage track. A scanning of a large 
baggage container would take less than four minutes. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, American Airlines has ordered 19 X-ray scanning devices 
that are capable of detecting plastic explosives for use at all airports where 
American's international flights originate or terminate. 
</P>
<P>
These scanning units are able to distinguish between inorganic and organic 
materials and will display the items on color monitors. The systems should be 
in place and operational by April. 
</P>
<P>
But some argue that the new technology designed to combat terrorists won't go 
far enough. 
</P>
<P>
"The real problem with airline security breaches as it now stands has little to 
do with new machines or equipment," an airline security consultant said. "It's 
the human factor -- the quality of the people we hire to operate the machines 
and the training we give them." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, most recorded breaches in security during surprise FAA inspections 
have occurred because personnel manning the equipment have missed weapons, 
bombs and other devices intentionally packed in bags by security officials. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA is seeking detectors that require little human judgment to find 
explosives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Circumventing People 
</P>
<P>
One system, Thermal Neutron Activation, acts almost independent of human 
judgment and doesn't require a security employee to interpret what is flashed 
on a screen. Instead, it bombards luggage with low-energy neutrons in a 
detection chamber. If explosives are detected, the baggage is automatically 
diverted. 
</P>
<P>
Another system was tested recently on passengers at Boston's Logan 
International Airport. This machine moves warm air around passengers as they 
enter a chamber. After that passenger leaves, an immediate chemical analysis is 
performed on the air sample, looking for the telltale chemical signatures of 
dynamite, plastic and TNT. 
</P>
<P>
Other machines are being designed to stop terrorism before the airplane gate. 
It is estimated that 90% of aviation terrorism involves the use of false 
passports. The new machines are working with high-technology identity 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
But we may have to wait as long as three years for these machines to be 
installed at high-risk airports. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. systems ordered by the FAA may not be in place until the end of this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
And the French weapon detection systems won't be in place until a year from 
now, and won't be fully operational until later next year. In addition, the 
systems are only useful in detecting weapons or guns, not explosives. 
</P>
<P>
"All of this will undoubtedly help in reducing the potential for disaster," 
says one airline security chief. "But we're still dealing with countries and 
terrorist organizations that will try to beat the system no matter what we do." 
</P>
<P>
For example, some U.S. airline security experts say that Libya has developed 
ways to disguise plastic explosives, molding the material into the shapes of 
hair dryers, calculators and other items typically found in passenger bags. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the sheer volume of bags checked in by passengers," one head of airline 
security said, "the odds of these devices getting past us is still good." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the technology gap between airline security officials and the 
terrorists they try to stop is still wide. 
</P>
<P>
Still, effective security steps are being taken by some airlines. Some of these 
new airport and airline security measures have already been implemented but 
most are not readily apparent to passengers. With few exceptions, most of these 
steps do not force long passenger delays at airports. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in the wake of the furor over Salman Rushdie's novel "The Satanic 
Verses," British Airways has taken steps to protect its planes, passengers and 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
British Airways Flight 20, between Hong Kong and London, makes a refueling stop 
en route in Bombay. Until recently, passengers who had boarded in Hong Kong 
were allowed to remain on board during the late-night stopover. 
</P>
<P>
Now they are required to leave the aircraft. Authorities then board during 
refueling and thoroughly search the passenger cabin. 
</P>
<P>
Then, when passengers reboard, a head count is made and matched against the 
number of bags each passenger has checked through to London. 
</P>
<P>
On one recent flight, after new and transit passengers had boarded Flight 20 
for the leg to London, the plane was delayed about an hour. The head count of 
passengers did not match the number of tickets collected. 
</P>
<P>
Finally it was discovered that ground agents had forgotten to take one 
passenger's ticket when he boarded. The numbers matched and the plane was sent 
on its almost 11-hour all-night journey to Heathrow. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot explained the problem, the resulting snafu and its ultimate 
resolution to the passengers. Not one passenger complained.

MOLOKAI AN EASY RIDE FOR BICYCLISTS

regular contributor to this section.

<P>
KAUNAKAKAI, Molokai 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My wife, Elfriede, and I rented a tandem bicycle on Maui and brought it by 
ferry across the 20 miles of the Molokai Channel. 
</P>
<P>
A few moments of pedaling down the main street of Ala Malama showed us why this 
island, long known as "Friendly Island," is being rediscovered as the "Bicycle 
Island." 
</P>
<P>
It has no stop-and-go signals, the pavement is wide and traffic is light. We 
cycled slowly past colorful stores and quaint shops, its small civic center and 
tiny budget-priced cafes and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Friendly Smiles 
</P>
<P>
Townspeople waved and smiled. One suggested we stop at Kanemitsu's Bakery for 
fresh Molokai bread. 
</P>
<P>
Progressive Travels, Seattle-based under new ownership, is capitalizing on this 
friendliness by continuing a second year of Molokai bicycle adventures, with 11 
tours scheduled through December. Bike tours have options for hiking and riding 
mules on clifftrails. 
</P>
<P>
The only public transportation on Molokai is three taxis. Rental cars are 
available at the main airport. Traffic along Kamehameha Highway, east and west 
of Kaunakakai, is light. 
</P>
<P>
When biking Molokai on your own, the biggest decision is always which way to go 
each day. The island is about 10 miles wide north to south, and about 60 miles 
from east to west. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prime Choice 
</P>
<P>
The Overlook at Palaau State Park on the north coast has one of the most 
dramatic views in the Pacific, overlooking the vertical rise of the world's 
highest sea cliffs, towering 3,300 feet above the crashing surf. 
</P>
<P>
Directly below the Overlook, down 1,600 feet of cliffside, is Kalaupapa 
Peninsula, site of the former leper colony and the spiritual center during 1989 
for what has been declared the Father Damien Centennial Year by Hawaii and 
Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
Father Damien de Voester came to this isolated colony from Belgium and died 
after he contracted the then-incurable disease of leprosy while serving its 
victims from 1873 to 1889. 
</P>
<P>
Asthey have for years, visitors take a mule or hike down the steep trail of 23 
switchbacks. Writer Jack London also hiked this trail to pay homage to Father 
Damien. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leprosy No Danger 
</P>
<P>
The guided-mule ride down the three-mile trail takes about 1 1/2 hours. Mules 
have been trained to step carefully and stay close to the inside edge of the 
narrow trail. 
</P>
<P>
Hiking down or up the trail can take 1 1/2 hours each way, although anyone 
accustomed to mountaining can make the climb in about 40 minutes. The hike is 
timed so not to encounter the mules. Trying to edge by could be upsetting to 
them and dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
The low green growth covering the rocks beside the trail give it the appearance 
of a lei twisting down the face of the cliff. The trail was carved in 1886 as a 
supply route. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
White Surf, High Cliffs 
</P>
<P>
Kalaupapa Peninsula is framed by white surf and the sea. The high cliffs rising 
along the north coast seem to block it off from the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
St. Philomena Church has been restored for this centennial year; April 15 marks 
the 100th anniversary of Damien's death. 
</P>
<P>
There will be special commemorative tributes throughout the islands. 
</P>
<P>
To preserve today's tranquillity in Kalaupapa village, visits via the small 
peninsula airport or the mule trail must be scheduled through Damien Hawaii 
Tours or Rare Adventures. Residents also can sponsor a visitor. 
</P>
<P>
The Rare Adventures Mule-Ride package is $75 and the Hike-In package is $30. 
Both include the trail trek, community tour and picnic lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Two of four other churches designed and built by Father Damien have been 
preserved. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on the bike tour to other areas of the island, stop near the 
junction of highways 470 and 460 where a hike of little more than an hour along 
a forest-reserve road leads into the Kamakou Nature Conservancy rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Largest Landholder 
</P>
<P>
Molokai Ranch, the largest landholder on the island, is the site of Wildlife 
Park with its giraffes, zebras, East African crowned cranes, antelope, Barbary 
sheep and Japanese deer. Tour safaris are $12 for adults, $6 for children under 
12. 
</P>
<P>
On another day a bicycle ride to the east end of the island reaches the remains 
of a 7th-Century village, small farms and two big waterfalls. 
</P>
<P>
Progressive Travels bicycle and walking tours are based at the Kaluakoi Hotel 
and Golf Club Resort, spread over 6,800 acres adjacent to Molokai Ranch. 
Accommodations are in two-story redwood buildings around the entrance lobby. 
</P>
<P>
The Progressive package for four days on Molokai and three on Maui is $1,495. 
It includes a room, meals, bicycles, guides and support vehicles. Contact 
Progressive Travels through your travel agent or call toll-free (800) 245-2229. 
</P>
<P>
On your own a four-day, three-night package at Kaluakoi Resort starts at $399 
per person, double occupancy. In addition to meals and accommodations it 
includes a bicycle and compact rental car. Call (800) 367-6046. 
</P>
<P>
To be centrally based near the town of Kaunakakai, the Hotel Molokai and Pau 
Hana Inn maintain the Polynesian mood of old Molokai with double rooms 
beginning at $55 at the hotel and $39 at the inn. Call (808) 553-5347. For the 
Rare Adventures mule ride and hike, call (800) 843-5978. 
</P>
<P>
To schedule a four-hour Kaulapapa Peninsula tour, phone Damien Tours at (808) 
567-6171. For complete information about Molokai and its many possible 
adventures, contact the Destination Molokai Assn., Travel Sales, 1600 Kapiolani 
Blvd., Suite 925, Honolulu 96814, phone (800) 367-4753. 
</P>
<P>
The ferry between Maui and Molokai makes two trips daily at $21 per person one 
way, with no charge for bicycles.

REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: HERE ARE SOME TIPS ON AVOIDING PROBLEMS WITH SECOND 
MORTGAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I think I was ripped off by a major savings and loan. We "locked in" 
a 10.75% interest rate. When we filled out the loan application we clearly 
showed that we were making a 10% cash down payment; the seller was giving us a 
10% second mortgage, and we wanted an 80% first mortgage. But when the loan 
papers were prepared we were charged 11.25%. The loan officer said this was 
because we have a second mortgage. We signed the papers under protest. Do you 
think we should complain? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Yes. There is no valid reason for a first mortgage lender to charge a 
higher interest rate because the borrower is also obtaining a second mortgage. 
Most lenders do not charge a higher interest rate when a second mortgage is 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
Having a second mortgage actually makes the first loan safer. The reason is 
that both the borrower and the second-mortgage lender are interested in keeping 
payments on the first loan current. If the borrower defaults, the 
second-mortgage lender often makes the payments on the first loan to avoid 
being wiped out by foreclosure by the first lender. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest you write to the president of the S&amp;L, explain that the loan 
officer knew you were getting a second mortgage but did not mention a higher 
interest rate. Depending on the amount of your loan, a one-half percent 
difference in the interest rate can amount to thousands of dollars over the 
30-year life of your loan. Don't give up. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Don't Count on Rising Value to Pay 'Balloon' 
</P>
<P>
Q: We are struggling to buy a home. But the realty agent found us a home that 
we can buy for 10% cash down payment, assume the existing first mortgage, and 
the seller will loan us the balance on a second mortgage. However, the seller 
wants a balloon payment in just two years. Although homes have been going up 
nicely in value in our town, I am worried that we won't be able to refinance in 
two years to pay the balloon. Should we take a chance? 
</P>
<P>
A: I do not recommend taking a balloon payment due in less than five years. You 
would be taking a major risk of not being able to refinance in two years for 
enough cash to pay off the balloon payment. If you don't pay off the balloon 
payment when it's due, you would either lose the house or have to sell it. But 
you will sleep much better if you negotiate with the seller to get her to carry 
that second mortgage for at least five years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Needs More Time for Replacement House 
</P>
<P>
Q: I need an extension for the 24-month period for buying a replacement home. 
In April, 1987, I sold my home and made about $45,000 profit. But due to 
business reverses since then, I do not have the money now to buy a replacement 
home so I can avoid paying tax on my profit. I phoned the IRS but was told that 
there is no way to get a hardship extension. I also called my congressman's 
office and he couldn't help. What should I do, because I can neither afford to 
buy a home nor can I afford to pay tax and interest on my $45,000 profit? 
</P>
<P>
A: Sorry, but you cannot get an extension beyond 24 months to buy your 
replacement principal residence of equal or greater cost so that you can defer 
the profit tax. Internal Revenue Code 1034 contains no provisions for extension 
for hardship unless you move out of the country or join the military. 
</P>
<P>
However, you can probably buy a home for little or no cash. All that matters is 
that you must own and occupy your replacement home within 24 months after 
selling your old residence. There is no requirement that you invest even $1 
from the home you sold into the replacement home. If qualified, you can buy a 
replacement home for nothing down with a VA mortgage and still claim the tax 
deferral. Consult your tax adviser on further details on the tax aspects of the 
home purchase. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can't Get Deductions If House Is Not Yours 
</P>
<P>
Q: I moved into my mother's home to care for her last year. Since I am 
financially well off I made her mortgage payments after she became unable to 
work. Can I deduct the mortgage interest and property taxes I paid? I do not 
own my own home. 
</P>
<P>
A: Unless you are legally obligated to pay the loan payments and the real 
estate taxes, you cannot deduct them on your personal income tax returns. 
However, if your mother adds your name to the home's title, you would become 
entitled to the deductions after the 
</P>
<P>
date you acquire an interest in the house. Consult your tax adviser for 
details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reinspect Home Just Before Sale Closes 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am a real estate broker and I can't recall your ever discussing the topic 
of buyers reinspecting homes just before the sale closes. My speciality is 
listing homes for sale, so I rarely work with buyers who are usually brought to 
my homes by other realty agents. However, I am shocked by about 75% of the 
agents who don't even suggest that their buyers reinspect the home shortly 
before the sale to be certain the seller left everything as agreed in good 
condition. I suggest reinspections because I don't want to be sued if the buyer 
isn't satisfied. Any idea why all agents don't encourage buyers to reinspect 
before closing, or do you think I am being paranoid? 
</P>
<P>
A: Congratulations on raising a topic near and dear to my heart. As a buyer of 
rental houses, I find it curious why agents often resent my request to 
reinspect the house just before the sale closing date. I suppose it is because 
they fear that everything will not be in good condition, or that the seller 
will have removed items to be included in the sale. 
</P>
<P>
The home buyer has maximum leverage over the seller before the sale closes. At 
this time the seller will do anything reasonable to get the sale closed. But 
after the seller has received the cash and left town, it is virtually 
impossible to get any problem corrected. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Must Home Sale Cash Purchase New Home? 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am receiving conflicting advice. We want to sell our townhouse and buy a 
single-family detached house. The real estate agent says we must reinvest all 
the cash from our sale into the replacement home if we are to defer the tax on 
our profit, which will be about $30,000. But our tax preparer at H&amp;R Block 
says all that matters is that we buy a replacement home within 24 months that 
costs at least as much as our net sales price for the townhouse. Who is right? 
</P>
<P>
A: Your tax preparer is right. Your realty agent is wrong. Internal Revenue 
Code Section 1034 allows you to defer your profit tax when you sell your 
principal residence and buy a replacement principal residence of equal or 
greater cost within 24 months before or after the sale. 
</P>
<P>
You need not reinvest even $1 from the sale into the replacement home. For 
example, you can sell your old home for cash, pay off its mortgage, spend the 
tax deferred cash as you please, and buy your qualifying new home for nothing 
down, such as with a VA mortgage, which requires no down payment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Time-Shares Not Real Estate Investments 
</P>
<P>
Q: We are considering buying a time-share vacation condo in Florida. What do 
you think of time-share real estate investments? 
</P>
<P>
A: Not much. Time-shares are not real estate investments. Rather, they are 
advance purchases of vacations. I have yet to hear of anyone who has made a 
decent cash profit on the resale of a time-share (except the developer). My 
recommendation is to spend only money you can afford to lose on a vacation 
time-share purchase.

MONTEBELLO GROUP FAILS IN ATTEMPT TO FORCE RECALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

MONTEBELLO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A coalition of businessmen and residents who were angered by the city's recent 
bid to use eminent domain in certain parts of south Montebello have failed to 
force a recall of four council members, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Recall leaders did not deliver the necessary petitions to City Hall by the 5 
p.m. deadline Thursday, city spokeswoman Maria Rassi said. They had targeted 
Mayor William Nighswonger and council members Kathy Salazar, Art Payan and 
Arnold Glasman. Councilman Edward Pizzorno was not included. 
</P>
<P>
"The group never showed up," Rassi said. "I just hope that we can all get back 
to work running the city." 
</P>
<P>
The organizers needed to gather the names of about 4,500 registered voters to 
force a recall election. But they fell about 200 signatures short of their 
goal, said Shirley Garcia, a member of Montebello Residents for a Better 
Government, which led the drive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lot of Enthusiasm' 
</P>
<P>
Other groups had joined Garcia's organization in charging that members of the 
City Council had ignored the will of voters and exhibited favoritism and 
cronyism in office. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of enthusiasm," Garcia said, admitting that she was "deeply 
disappointed" in not gathering enough signatures. "But a lot of our volunteers 
just got sick." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said that her group will now attempt to persuade voters to reject three 
eminent-domain ballot measures in a special election May 2. Voters are being 
asked to decide whether to give the city condemnation powers over two 
redevelopment areas in mostly commercial and industrial sections of south 
Montebello. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the measures point out that some residential properties lay in the 
redevelopment areas, but city officials have vowed to exempt homes from 
condemnation proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a valuable learning experience," Garcia said of the failed signature 
drive, during which the two sides, standing in front of local markets, often 
clashed bitterly in front of passers-by. "We are novices, but we are learning 
more every day," Garcia added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Celebrate Victory 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the targets of the recall celebrated their victory Thursday night at 
a local restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people have worked very hard on this effort (to defeat the recall 
movement)," Councilman Glasman said from the Prime Cut Restaurant on Beverly 
Boulevard. "For now, they are ready to celebrate. Come tomorrow, though, its 
back to work." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Payan attributed the failure to a strong anti-recall campaign by 
council supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"Our people went to work to try to give the community the other side of the 
story," Payan said. He and other council members targeted for recall accused 
the opposition of a variety of distortions. He said the failure of the recall 
drive showed that voters were not swayed by the charges. "I was feeling pretty 
good about them not getting enough names," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Payan also said that a decision two weeks ago by the management of the Ralphs 
at Whittier and Montebello boulevards to bar any signature-gatherers from 
standing in front of the supermarket could have dampened the enthusiasm of the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Received Complaints 
</P>
<P>
"The market received a lot of complaints about shoppers getting harassed," 
Payan said. "I'm sure (the decision) was a major setback for them" 
</P>
<P>
At one point during the heated campaign, Assemblyman Charles M. Calderon 
(D-Whittier) and U.S. Rep. Matthew G. Martinez (D-Monterey Park) issued a joint 
statement supporting the council members. 
</P>
<P>
"The recall process is not immune to misuse and abuse," the two lawmakers wrote 
in the statement. "We do not agree with the council on every issue, but on 
balance we think they work hard to do the right thing for our community."

HOSPITAL SHIP CONVERSION PROJECT HITS FINANCIAL SHOALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like a ghost ship at the mercy of the elements, the Oceanic sits idly in the 
harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Below the bare decks, darkened passageways strewn with debris lead to crew's 
quarters containing bunks without mattresses and toilets without plumbing. On a 
table near the bridge lay two old maps, one of the Maine coast, the other 
showing New York's Hudson and East rivers from Governor's Island to 67th 
Street. In the galley next to a bowl of rotten grapes and a crumbled cigarette 
carton, a dusty guest book bears entries that end on Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
That is the last time anybody but journalists has been aboard the Oceanic. For 
more than a month, the vessel has been anchored a few hundred yards offshore 
near the Long Beach Naval Station in the Port of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
There are those who envision the ship -- which is painted white with a huge red 
cross on its side -- as a majestic floating hospital that will one day carry 
volunteer doctors to needy ports in Mexico and Central America. In reality the 
vessel, accessible by water taxi at a fee of $100 an hour, is at the center of 
a bureaucratic dispute that may keep it anchored for some time. 
</P>
<P>
The most immediate problem is that Los Angeles port officials will not let the 
ship berth until it can operate under its own power. But its skipper says the 
ship can't operate under its own power until port officials let it berth for 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
The project "just might go down the tubes," complained Tom Keegan, a former 
Merchant Marine captain, now in a wheelchair, who skippers the Oceanic. "That 
would be sad for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Counters Ed Hill, the port's chief wharfinger: "The ship's a long way from 
being operable. Putting her in port would be dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Keegan, 49, first conceived his dream of delivering medical supplies and 
services to Third World countries after a 1985 motorcycle accident paralyzed 
him from the chest down, ending a seagoing career that had spanned 25 years. 
Becoming acquainted with the medical technology that saved his life, he said, 
helped him recognize the dearth of proper medical equipment and services in 
many of the ports he had visited. 
</P>
<P>
"People south of the border in my condition wouldn't have survived," he said. 
"They don't need food down there as much as they need medical attention." 
</P>
<P>
When he heard of an available ship with 7,500 square feet of covered deck space 
and 800 tons of storage capacity, the captain rejoiced. Built by the Canadian 
government in 1969, the Oceanic -- formerly called the Atlantic Jag -- served 
as a tuna clipper for several years before being purchased by Sea Trec 
Enterprises Inc., a shipbuilding firm in Chula Vista that intended to convert 
it into a salmon processor. But financing for the project fell through, leaving 
the 200-foot vessel tied up and losing money. When Keegan suggested converting 
it into a hospital, the owners agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a pretty convincing chap," said Sea Trec owner Doug Lotoski, whose wife 
is a nurse. "He's got a good idea, the ship would be ideal for the project and 
he is very very sincere. So we thought we'd give him a shot." 
</P>
<P>
Although Sea Trec still owns the vessel, Lotoski said, the company has agreed 
to sell it eventually to Keegan for an unspecified amount. In the meantime, he 
said, the captain has full possession of the vessel as he attempts to add four 
operating rooms, eight recovery beds, three dental chairs, an X-ray machine, 
orthopedic unit and complete blood lab. 
</P>
<P>
Just how he intends to accomplish all that is still rather vague. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nonprofit Status 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, Keegan set up a nonprofit organization headed by Dr. Alton 
Ochsner, a New Orleans surgeon. "The idea is very good," said Ochsner, who also 
heads a private foundation that provides medical aid to the indigent in the 
Caribbean. "We've been slow in getting this thing going." Ochsner said he first 
heard of Keegan's work through a mutual friend in the medical community. 
</P>
<P>
Others listed as members of Keegan's board of directors include Dr. P. William 
Oysinger, a professor of internal medicine at Loma Linda University; Frank C. 
Flores Jr., a dentist on the staff of the USC School of Dentistry; Robert E. 
Green, a dentist in private practice in Highland, Calif., and Alejandro 
Rostran, a member of the New Orleans Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
According to Keegan, the proposed remodeling of the Oceanic -- as well as the 
plans for its eventual operation with the help of volunteer doctors and crew 
members -- is being overseen by board members and various volunteer medical 
technicians. The remodeling work, he said, will be done by several local 
maritime unions that have offered to work for free. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for San Bernardino Community Hospital, where Keegan once was a 
patient, said hospital staff members are collecting used medical equipment to 
donate to the project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Support Promised 
</P>
<P>
The captain also carries a sheath of letters from foundations, private 
companies, medical centers, doctors, hospitals and politicians promising 
various levels of moral, material and financial support. 
</P>
<P>
What Keegan does not have much of, however, is cash. 
</P>
<P>
So several weeks ago he moved the ship up the coast from San Diego to San Pedro 
in an effort to attract more attention and thereby generate more contributions. 
Because of a defective generator and other problems, however, the ship had to 
be towed all the way. Now, its inability to move under its own power has become 
an albatross that threatens to sink the project altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. Army has offered to let Keegan use one of its docks for the 
90 days he estimates it will take to convert the Oceanic to medical use, the 
dock at Berth 55 in San Pedro was not immediately available the day the vessel 
arrived. So port officials decided to give the ship temporary berthing nearby. 
But after a short grace period during which little apparent progress was made, 
they had the ship unceremoniously towed to its present out-of-the-way location 
in the outer harbor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
He Needs Three Weeks 
</P>
<P>
"That's a surge area," Hill said, referring to the fact that the Army's Berth 
55 is subject to changing tide levels, which sometimes require vessels to be 
moved. "We don't put dead vessels there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Keegan says he needs at least three more weeks in port to do the repairs 
necessary to make the ship seaworthy. Hill says that to let an inoperable ship 
tie up any longer would have constituted an unacceptable hazard. And hanging 
over everything is the $114-a-day tariff normally charged by the port for ships 
the size of the Oceanic. 
</P>
<P>
Keegan says he can't afford the tariff and that it ought to be waived. Hill 
says that a decision to waive the tariff could be considered only if Keegan can 
prove that the Oceanic is a bona fide relief vessel destined for a country 
considered stricken. 
</P>
<P>
"No vessel is a relief vessel if it's dead in the water," the wharfinger said. 
"(Keegan's) been treated very generously by the port, but we have our 
limitations."

FAKE KELP IS REAL ANSWER TO EROSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every year, the ocean stole more of the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Winter storms ravaged a 10-block section of shoreline, carrying away a mountain 
of sand. The ocean gradually crept closer to the posh seafront homes on the 
peninsula near Belmont Shore. 
</P>
<P>
By 1979, former city Public Works Director James T. Pott recalled, the problem 
was getting out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I was called out at some ungodly hour of the night because the owner of a 
house on the boardwalk was getting seawater splashed on his front windows," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach was quickly losing part of its long beach. Pott said he assured the 
man that the city would try to halt the erosion. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal engineers were hired to find a solution. They suggested such expensive 
remedies as extending the offshore breakwater or building a sunken rock 
structure to keep the sand from washing away. 
</P>
<P>
But it was a persuasive salesman, not the engineers, who eventually provided 
the solution -- "synthetic seaweed." 
</P>
<P>
And after six years, the ersatz kelp is working so well that the city is about 
to spend another $7,000 or so to buy more. Erosion began to halt as early as 
1984, when Councilwoman Jan Hall announced the early success of the program in 
a formal paper presented at a conference in Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Problem for Boaters 
</P>
<P>
"We're delighted. It's worked," Hall said. "It's something that doesn't 
interfere with swimmers and boaters. It has stabilized the beach for a long 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Synthetic seaweed acts like the undulating leaves of underwater plants, but 
does not look anything like them. It is a barrier of plastic or fiberglass 
sheeting that knocks down large sand particles that normally would be carried 
out to sea. 
</P>
<P>
A single unit resembles a big paint dropcloth or car cover that has been 
shredded to create strips, like fingers on a hand. A sleeve is sewn into the 
bottom, which is filled with sand that serves as an anchor. Ping-Pong balls or 
Styrofoam blocks are sewn in at the top to allow the strips to float upright. 
</P>
<P>
The units -- each about five feet high and four feet wide -- are sunk in about 
eight feet of water off the beach. Over time, Hall said, they stop enough sand 
that the strips become buried. But the strips are still effective because they 
create mounds on the sea floor. The mounds take the energy out of the big waves 
that crash ashore, and less sand washes away. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other beach communities that are completely exposed to the ocean, most 
of Long Beach's four-mile strand of sand is protected by a breakwater. 
Virtually all of Long Beach's oceanfront has little more than knee-high waves 
except for the unprotected stretch running from about 60th to 70th places on 
the peninsula, which divides Alamitos Bay from the sea. 
</P>
<P>
There, the city has waged its years-long battle to keep the sands in place. 
Photos taken during World War II show that stretch along the peninsula 
virtually devoid of sand, with huge boulders at the base of the seawall. 
Between 1957 and 1978, the city estimates it was losing 5 to 10 feet of 
beachfront a year to erosion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bulldozers Called In 
</P>
<P>
Wooden jetties running 200 feet into the ocean were constructed after the war 
along the peninsula to try to stop the erosion, but did little to stabilize the 
troubled section known as East Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Bulldozers pushed the sand up on the beach during winters to minimize sand loss 
during storms, and additional sand was dredged from the bay to rejuvenate the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
Former city Public Works Director Pott said a number of possible solutions were 
being considered, some of them quite expensive, when he was visited by a 
salesman offering the phony seaweed. 
</P>
<P>
"A salesman for this stuff saw an article in the newspaper (about the erosion 
problem) and said, 'Boy, have I got a deal for you,' " Pott recalled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Used on East Coast 
</P>
<P>
A similar installation was being credited with saving the famous lighthouse 
near Cape Hatteras, N.C., and appeared to be successful in preserving beaches 
in communities on the banks of Lake Michigan. Pott said he was intrigued enough 
to take the idea to Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Because the idea was not scientifically proven, "the risk would have been too 
high for a scared public works director to do himself," said Pott, now a 
private engineering consultant based in Long Beach. "Thanks to (Hall) and her 
dealings with the community, she and the Alamitos Bay Beach Protection Assn. 
and public works, in concert together and knowing all the risks, decided to 
proceed." 
</P>
<P>
First, a dredge restored the beach to its original condition. Then, 1,600 of 
the artificial kelp units were dropped in three rows, positioned like snow 
fences by scuba divers. The total cost of the units was $57,500 of $950,000 
total spent on the project. 
</P>
<P>
Different kinds of artificial kelp were installed to see which would be most 
effective, Pott said. Fiberglass cloth was found to resist barnacles and other 
sea growths that weigh it down and cause it to sink. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More to Be Purchased 
</P>
<P>
Now, city officials are hoping to cut the losses to erosion even more. City 
Marine Bureau Director Richard L. Miller said the next installation of 
synthetic seaweed should begin in another month or two. The City Council gave 
its blessings last week and city purchasing officials say bids will be opened 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
The beach will be leveled out with dredged material to give the next "planting" 
of phony seaweed a strong start, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller added, however, that the artificial seaweed will not work everywhere. 
The plastic barriers proved unsuccessful in stopping erosion inside by the bay, 
presumably caused by suction from the cooling water intakes for nearby electric 
power-generating steam plants. The sand particles in the bay are too fine to be

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Lynwood Unified School District official has pleaded no contest to felony 
charges of grand theft and receiving stolen property from the school system. 
</P>
<P>
Commodore Reid, 53, is scheduled to be sentenced April 10 by Los Angeles 
Superior Court Judge J.D. Smith, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Herbert R. Lapin. The 
charges carry a maximum four-year prison sentence, but under a plea agreement, 
Reid can be sentenced to one year only, Lapin said. 
</P>
<P>
Reid also will be required to make restitution to the district in an amount 
still to be determined. Lapin estimated that the district lost at least $2,000 
in supplies and employee time. 
</P>
<P>
Embezzlement and conflict-of-interest charges against Reid will be dropped in 
exchange for the plea agreement, Lapin said. 
</P>
<P>
Reid, the district's director of maintenance, operations and transportation, 
was accused of having on-duty school employees renovate and repair his personal 
property, having a district water heater installed on his property and of 
obtaining a $15,500 loan from a vendor who was doing business with the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Reid, a nine-year district employee, was suspended after charges were filed 
last April. Supt. LaVoneia C. Steele was unavailable for comment on Reid's 
current status, a spokeswoman said.

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: A STRATEGY FOR PEACE HUMAN VALUES AND THE THREAT OF WAR BY 
SISSELA BOK (PANTHEON: $17.95; 196 PP.) 
</P>

Sissela Bok, a professor of philosophy at Brandeis University, goes out of her 
way in these pages to make hers a practical strategy, acknowledging key 
arguments likely to be raised by cynics, pragmatists and hawks and steering 
clear of fuzzy-headed liberalism, from old calls for unilateral disarmament to 
New Age heralds of world unity under Gaia. "Nuclear weapons cannot be 
disinvented," Bok writes. "The reasons for mutual fear and distrust are real 
enough and powerful enough to keep nations from reducing the threat decisively, 
let alone wiping it out entirely." 
</P>
<P>
Pacifists are likely to criticize this initial argument for being circular -- 
the surfeit of weapons makes it too dangerous to eliminate weapons -- but Bok 
is by no means justifying proliferation. She argues, rather, that before we can 
begin to eliminate arms, we must find ways of diminishing dangerous forms of 
distrust between nations. We can begin, she suggests, by distinguishing more 
carefully between "rational distrust" -- a healthy attitude leading to mutually 
beneficial agreements, such as those for on-site inspection -- and "irrational 
distrust," a pathological form of behavior that only "intensifies distrust on 
the part of one's adversary." "It will be necessary," Bok writes, "to reexamine 
. . . the world-spanning smog of disinformation, the surreptitious and overt 
moves to cheat on international treaties, human rights violations, the support 
of regional wars, and the encouragement of terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
Bok's strategy is often less than practical, castigating ignoble behavior 
rather than examining the social, political and economic tensions that 
encourage it. She reaffirms lofty principles, such as the Golden Rule, while 
criticizing "primitive societies" for "wounding and killing outsiders" out of 
"indifference" and "pride." But she doesn't suggest how we can reduce the sense 
of cultural instability many nations feel when they are exposed to the 
relativism of an increasingly interdependent world. Nor does she explore 
practical ways to reduce the threat perceived by Third World nations, who see 
themselves in an economic free-fall behind the First World. 
</P>
<P>
"A Strategy for Peace" is successful, however, as a warning about the dangerous 
"inertia" of despair and complacency. While pragmatic, it is far from an 
apologia for current nuclear strategy. By pointing out the wildly irresponsible 
thinking of John F. Kennedy's advisers during the Cuban Missile Crisis, for 
instance, Bok makes it clear that government leaders alone cannot be trusted to 
ensure nuclear peace. If any one of six of these advisers had been President 
during the crisis, Robert Kennedy told an interviewer, "I think the world would 
have blown up."

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: BETWEEN STRANGERS SURROGATE MOTHERS, EXPECTANT FATHERS,

RE-CREATING MOTHERHOOD IDEOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY IN A PATRIARCHAL SOCIETY BY 
BARBARA KATZ ROTHMAN (W.W. NORTON: $18.95; 260 PP.)

<TEXT>
<P>
City University sociologist Barbara Katz Rothman is one of the last people we 
would expect to find arguing against a woman's right to become a surrogate 
mother. Like Lori Andrews, a lawyer, journalist and leading advocate of 
surrogacy, Rothman is a feminist who takes pride in having successfully worked 
toward social liberalization: Supporting "Roe vs. Wade" by arguing that women 
are capable of making informed reproductive decisions; suggesting ways for gay 
and lesbian households to become "alternative kinds of family," not merely 
"alternatives to the family"; contending that divorce does not "have to 'break' 
families, but can sometimes blend and extend them." Surrogate mothering only 
follows in step with these liberalizations, one might argue, offering a 
recourse for the growing number of women in their middle to late 30s who have 
found that fertility passed them by while they were pursuing education and 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
Though she doesn't admit it in "Re-creating Motherhood," Rothman did once 
support surrogacy. In a 1982 article for Ms. magazine, she called it a 
promising new form of "reproductive communism, with each giving according to 
his or her ability." Since then, however, Rothman has become convinced that 
surrogacy will only diminish our appreciation of the most primal human bond, 
that between mother and child, encouraging us to view childbearing not as a 
spiritually significant relationship, but as a form of labor. Rothman's dreams 
of a "communistic" surrogacy have thus faded behind nightmare visions of "baby 
farms" where "the Third World women in America," "the women who are now pushing 
white babies in strollers, will be seen carrying white babies in their 
bellies." Rothman sometimes allows her visions to carry her arguments to almost 
comic extremes, suggesting that babies might one day be bred and marketed like 
"chickens at Holly Farms." The analogy is powerful, suggesting that surrogate 
children are commodities, but Rothman offers no evidence that surrogacy will 
exploit them or cause them to be any less loved by their families. 
</P>
<P>
While Andrews argues reservedly, standing behind testimonials and polls showing 
that Americans support surrogacy by a 2 to 1 margin, she does suggest a 
workable solution to current anxieties about surrogacy: A bill (now vegetating 
in the New York state legislature) that permits surrogacy after psychological 
and medical testing of all parties and that allows the surrogate mother to make 
all medical decisions (including abortion) during pregnancy. "Re-creating 
Motherhood" remains the more powerful and heartfelt book, however. While 
questionable for its call to ban surrogacy, it is eloquent in defending the 
dignity of motherhood and in showing how it has become devalued. Rothman writes 
of billboard ads, for example, that showed two newborn footprints, one from a 
full-term and one from a premature infant. Asking, "Guess which baby's mother 
smoked while pregnant?," the ads presented "mothers as 'bad workers' producing 
'flawed products,' " Rothman writes, adding that she looked "in vain for the ad 
that says 'Guess which baby's mother tried to get by on welfare?' . . . 'Guess 
which baby's mother didn't get prenatal care?' "

THE LAST PRINCE CHARLES; 
</P>
<P>
BONNIE PRINCE CHARLIE BY CAROLLY ERICKSON (WILLIAM MORROW: $19.95; 348 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Walter Russell Mead, Mead is a historian and an economist; his most recent 
book is Mortal Splendor: The American Empire in Transition (Houghton Mifflin). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under the wicked King Miraz, the children of C. S. Lewis' Narnia were forced to 
learn their history from books as false as the most exciting novels and as dull 
as the most exacting scholarship. Carolly Erickson has not quite written a book 
that only King Miraz would love, but she has come dangerously close. "Bonnie 
Prince Charlie" strips the Bonnie Prince of any romantic appeal that clings to 
the last serious Stuart claimant to the British throne -- but leaves us without 
an understanding either of Bonnie Prince Charlie as a man, or of the historical 
forces that doomed the Stuart heir to a futile life on the fringes of 
18th-Century European affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Like many of his ill-fated ancestors, Charles was at his best in moments of 
picturesque danger. After the defeat of his ill-starred attempt to invade 
England and reclaim the throne in 1745, he wandered in the Scottish wilds for 
months, sometimes dressed as a servant, sometimes as a woman, sleeping in the 
open field and waiting for the ship that would take him back to France. At one 
juncture, he was rescued by Flora MacDonald, a romantic Scot who later said 
that she would have done as much for Charles' Hanoverian rival if he had needed 
it, and who fled from America after siding with the Tories during our 
Revolution. This is the moment that made Charles famous throughout Europe, and 
this is the moment that made him a sentimental favorite of posterity. 
</P>
<P>
Misfortune usually brought out the best in the Stuarts. Mary Queen of Scots and 
Charles I faced the headman's ax with equanimity; even the indolent Charles II 
managed to hide, very nobly and romantically, from pursuers in the branches of 
an oak. But long life was the bane of the family. James I was a truly 
undistinguished king best remembered for a bad book on witchcraft and the 
imprisonment and execution of Sir Walter Raleigh. Charles I drove Parliament to 
rebel; Charles II was in the pay of England's deadliest enemy, Louis XIV; James 
II appalled even English Catholics by his ill-considered, illegal efforts to 
impose an unpopular religion on his Protestant subjects. Bonnie Prince Charlie, 
for his part, matured into a drunken, woman-beating lout. 
</P>
<P>
We can only admire the Stuarts at a distance, or in their brief heroic moments. 
The more we know about them, the less patient with, and the less interested we 
are in them. To read a biography on such people is to lose sympathy, and 
usually interest, in the central figure: a daunting problem for popular 
biographers. The problem is worse in the case of Bonnie Prince Charlie; his 
royal ancestors lived at the center of power and fashion; the poor Pretender 
eked out a miserable existence at the margin. 
</P>
<P>
The sources for Charles' life are also unsatisfactory. He wrote short and 
impersonal letters, and the documents we have concerning him are generally the 
reports of ambassadors and spies. We know what color shirt and what color 
stockings he wore to dinner; we do not know what he thought or felt. Where 
Erickson tries to supplement the scarcity of historical records with 
psychological speculation, the results are unsatisfactory and thin. She tells 
us many facts about Charles, but does not help us either pity or admire him. 
</P>
<P>
The sad truth is that Bonnie Prince Charlie is not worth the whole book; if 
Erickson was determined to write about him, she ought to have broadened her 
focus, and looked at the whole Jacobite movement. Absence made the heart grow 
fonder: There were many in England and Scotland who revered the Pretenders as 
the rightful kings, and Jacobitism long held a romantic fascination for some of 
the best minds in Britain. Where the power of Jacobitism lay, and why Charles 
was never able to harness it, would make a valuable and fascinating work of 
popular history. 
</P>
<P>
It would also have corrected this book's chief defect: its murky picture of the 
political context of Charles' life. The reader who starts out knowing little 
about English politics in the period will learn little here; the reader who 
knows more will be put off by a careless tendency to represent the struggle as 
a personal one between the Stuart Pretender and the indolently porcine 
Hanoverians. 
</P>
<P>
The ideal reader for this book is someone who wishes to write a romance novel 
loosely based on Bonnie Prince Charlie; such a reader will find a wealth of 
detail and information here and, lacking Erickson's obligations to the historic 
record, can freely re-create the dashing Charlie of legend. The rest of us will 
do better to stick to older sources. Macaulay's masterful, if malicious, 
"History of England" explains why the Stuarts lost their throne; Thackeray's 
brilliant novel, "Henry Esmond," explains why they could never regain it. These 
two books, one a frankly partisan attack and the other a historical novel, 
bring the reader closer to the spirit of the age of that era than Erickson 
does, for all her historical scruples and careful research.

A 'HERSTORY' OF PRIVATE LIFE IN THE 1950S; 
</P>
<P>
HOMEWARD BOUND AMERICAN FAMILIES IN THE COLD WAR ERA BY ELAINE TYLER MAY (BASIC 
BOOKS: $20.95; 284 PP.; ILLUSTRATED; 0-465-03054-8) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Constance Perin, Perin is a cultural anthropologist whose new book is 
Belonging in America: Reading Between the Lines (University of Wisconsin 
Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why were Americans of the 1950s so deeply immersed in domesticities: having 
large families, enjoying suburban havens, being ideal mothers and fathers, and, 
not least, crystallizing gender as breadwinners and homemakers? In "Homeward 
Bound: American Families in the Cold War Era," Elaine Tyler May proposes that 
our foreign policy of "containment" of the Soviet sphere of influence had its 
domestic analogue in an ideology of domestic "containment." 
</P>
<P>
Americans "wanted secure jobs, secure homes, and secure marriages in a secure 
country . . . and so they adhered to an overarching principle that would guide 
them in their personal and political lives: containment. . . . More than merely 
a metaphor for the Cold War on the homefront, containment aptly describes the 
way in which public policy, personal behavior, and even political values were 
focused on the home." 
</P>
<P>
This "familial ideology" was a culmination, May claims, of an enduring sexism 
that "withered" incipient alternatives to women's traditional gender roles. 
Women's suffrage, the sexual openness of the 1920s, marital partnerships that 
kept families afloat in the 1930s, the abrupt rise of women in the paid 
workforce during the '40s war effort -- all such historic potentialities for a 
"radical restructuring" of the family and the workplace were lost in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
Skillfully piecing together a social history of sex roles and mores governing 
dating, parenting, birth control, consumerism, and divorce from the Depression 
to the late '60s, May supports her thesis with a wide range of unusual 
evidence, from Hollywood scripts and movie magazines to opinion surveys, 
economic studies, and federal employment and civil defense policies. Her larger 
aim is to dismantle the iron curtain that this culture (especially academic 
culture) has imagined between domestic and political events. 
</P>
<P>
May also draws on a unique archive of the marital experiences and attitudes of 
about 300 white, well-educated, middle-class American couples who filled out 
periodic surveys about their domestic choices, fulfillments, and regrets over 
the 20 years between the late '30s and the mid-'50s. The voices of about 60 
couples who appended spontaneous comments tell Cheever-like stories. 
</P>
<P>
The sexual politics of the '50s were particularly ugly, not least because they 
went unchallenged. In those of the McCarthy era, from "the Senate to the FBI, 
from anti-communists in Hollywood to Mickey Spillane, moral weakness was 
associated with sexual degeneracy, which allegedly led to communism. To avoid 
dire consequences, men as well as women had to contain their sexuality in 
marriage where masculine men would be in control with sexually submissive 
competent homemakers at their side. Strong families required two essential 
ingredients: sexual restraint outside marriage and traditional gender roles in 
marriage." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout, paid workforce participation is May's benchmark for judging women's 
social and moral equality. She sees it as being the most effective route to the 
wider changes she advocates -- "restructuring of the labor force along 
gender-neutral lines, ending sex segregation in the workplace and bringing 
about a realignment of domestic roles." 
</P>
<P>
But that criterion was rarely met: When middle-class women "found that 
professionalized homemaking was not enough to keep their minds alive . . . they 
faced few alternatives, other than unpaid community volunteer work or menial, 
subordinate jobs in the sex-segregated paid labor force." 
</P>
<P>
There is an anachronism here -- in this period, however unfreely chosen, the 
facts are that thousands of other middle-class homemakers were like those who 
report in these pages their considerable satisfaction with volunteer work (for 
one woman, a two-child family was her limit because she wanted to expand those 
activities). 
</P>
<P>
May overcontains the homemaker ethos in dismissing the community involvement 
ethos, which in that period as in others before, fell well within the orbit of 
"women's work." The alternatives she poses are not qualitatively equal in their 
effects on women's feelings of public efficacy and self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
An important historical question is to what extent women's social and civic 
energies (subsidized by breadwinners who may have paid other women for child 
care and housework) were a significant source of their leadership and political 
skills since put to use politically and personally -- and which these women may 
have taught to daughters and sons. The 50,000 women who, May reports, 
participated in the 1961 "Women's Strike for Peace" cannot have been only 
bridge partners and shopping companions. 
</P>
<P>
In spotlighting the condition of "contained" homemakers, however, May makes us 
see afresh how diabolical sexism is. The marriage of one couple who had had 
premarital sex was pervaded with distrust because the husband, wedded to the 
double standard, could never recover his respect for his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Less familiar to us are the effects of breadwinner containment on men's lives. 
May offers glimmers, which are not much less chilling -- she chronicles their 
self-blame during the Depression and, by her report and by those of men, 
middle-class men's greatest dissatisfactions with their work: "too much 
pressure, tense relationships with employers or employees, efforts to achieve 
promotions or raises, boredom or ennui, and financial difficulties." 
</P>
<P>
But this is a "herstory" -- there is no index entry for "men," while that for 
"women" runs to nine lines. Men's plight is characterized by its oppressive 
consequences for women: "Family life would presumably provide men with the 
sense of power they were not likely to experience at work. At home, they could 
see tangible results of their efforts and achieve a measure of respect. It was 
important for these men to be the unchallenged heads of their households." 
</P>
<P>
Glasnost has just arrived, and whether it relaxes gender "containments" remains 
to be seen. With a new spirit of openness abroad and, we are being led to hope, 
at home, perhaps we can also hope that men in far greater numbers will make 
this stance theirs and acknowledge openly their own work-life predicaments and 
those their cultural dominance imposes on daughters, sisters, spouses, 
companions, friends and mothers.

SAD STAN, FUNNY FREBERG; 
</P>
<P>
IT ONLY HURTS WHEN I LAUGH BY STAN FREBERG (TIMES BOOKS: $19.95; 306 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Lawrence Christon, Christon is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of the variety of motives for writing autobiography, revenge has to rank high 
among them. "It Only Hurts When I Laugh" is comedy/song/commercial writer Stan 
Freberg's look back at a career that has been a strange mix of spectacular 
achievement and peculiar unacknowledgment. Or dis-acknowledgement. 
</P>
<P>
Part of that may have to do with his uncategorizable, protean talents. The son 
of a Pasadena Baptist minister, Freberg began his career in the late '40s doing 
voices for Warner Brothers cartoons and went on to write and perform radio and 
television comedy, with some zany stops between (he mentions joining a band 
called Red Fox and His Musical Hounds, where his inability to play an 
instrument went undetected -- it was the kind of band where the trumpet player 
wore a King Kong head). 
</P>
<P>
Freberg has had an uncanny knack for striking America's funnybone in a way it 
hasn't been struck before (his bedroom spoof "John and Marsha" was a '50s radio 
sensation). But it was as a creator of commercials that he showed memorable 
flair. Along with Bob &amp; Ray, Freberg was one of the first artists to use 
comedy and satire in ads ("Who put eight great tomatoes in that little bitty 
can?" is one of his infectious phrases), and although such devices are common 
now, they weren't when he was starting out. 
</P>
<P>
There's the rub. Aptly titled, "It Only Hurts When I laugh," is a display of 
Freberg's battle scars from fighting "paranoid" corporate lawyers, grim ad 
account executives and their minions, and finally, the redoubtable Broadway 
producer, David Merrick. All, in one way or another, appear twisted or 
pusillanimous -- or both -- and his dealings with them form the pattern of the 
book, which could be sub-titled "Rocky Goes to Madison Avenue." That is, 
Freberg reports his ideas, how they're met with resistance, and how they always 
ultimately triumph where it counts in American life -- the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
Years of this kind of fighting and of having to prove himself each time out 
have taken their toll on Freberg's sangfroid. His book has a small touch of the 
megalomania that afflicts anyone who has had that kind of struggle. It's 
written in a breezy, congenial, show-bizzy style (it can't just be "Paul T. 
Smith, the jazz pianist," it has to be "Paul T. Smith, the brilliant jazz 
pianist") and isn't especially notable for the things that make autobiographies 
great, namely, introspection, revelation or a pungent re-enactment of time and 
place. 
</P>
<P>
His indignation over the self-importance of advertisers, and their 
megalomanical assault on the culture, undermines his affable demeanor. As 
someone who's grown up in a religious household, it clearly rankles him to see 
that, as far as American advertising is concerned, nothing is sacred.

A GROUNDER THAT DIES MIDWAY TO FIRST BASE;

<P>
BEANBALL BY TOM SEAVER WITH HERB RESNICOW (WILLIAM MORROW: $16.95; 224 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
So, what does a guy do while he's sitting around waiting to be voted into 
baseball's Hall of Fame? Well, if that person is 311-game winner Tom Seaver, he 
might try his hand at writing whodunits. 
</P>
<P>
This would seem to be an unlikely career change for most athletes, but Seaver's 
been successful in many ventures, and he is a personable, informed and 
well-traveled gentleman. That he should take up the novelist's pen, as he has 
the broadcaster's mike, is no great shock. In fact, he's already written a few 
nonfiction books, including "The Art of Pitching" and "How I Would Pitch to 
Babe Ruth." 
</P>
<P>
Still, "Beanball" co-author Herb Resnicow must be quite a salesman. Not only 
did he convince the great right-hander -- a former member of the Mets, Reds, 
White Sox and Red Sox -- to join him on the mystery train but, in 1986, he also 
managed to talk Hall of Fame quarterback Fran Tarkenton into adding his name to 
"Murder at the Super Bowl" (PaperJacks: $3.95). He also wrote "The World Cup 
Murder" with soccer great Pele. 
</P>
<P>
It would be nice to report that Tom Terrific's mystery is as masterful as his 
pitching, but, alas, it isn't. This has less to do with Seaver's literary 
prowess, however, than it does with Resnicow's peculiar sense of how things get 
done in the real world. 
</P>
<P>
In his first such effort, "Murder at the Super Bowl," it wasn't easy to tell 
exactly where Tarkenton's input ended and Resnicow's began. "Beanball" makes it 
clear where that line is drawn because the books are practically identical: 
same plot, same suspects, same goofy characters, same dilemmas. The difference 
is the sport and the victims: Fran killed off a football coach, Tom ices a 
baseball owner. 
</P>
<P>
The Resnicow formula sets forth that a professional sports team based in 
Brooklyn has just captured its division's championship and, against all odds, 
is pitted against a heavily favored competitor for the overall league 
championship. Sometime before that game, however, an important member of the 
Brooklyn squad is killed. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Marcus Aurelius Burr, an excruciatingly yuppified sportswriter who really 
wants to become an investigative reporter ("Uncover one major scandal and your 
fortune's made. Books, movies, TV.") Burr always manages to stumble upon the 
murder victim hours before anyone else and, like a true "Front Page" 
journalist, calls his editor before he alerts the police -- which hardly 
endears him to the homicide boys downtown. Seaver's and Tarkenton's input seems 
to come chiefly in providing sports color and inventing game strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Well, it's not Travis McGee, but so far, so good. The problem -- and it's a 
huge one -- comes in the fact that Resnicow hasn't the foggiest notion how a 
real newspaper is run, especially as it pertains to the relationship between 
reporters and editors. 
</P>
<P>
In both books, Burr and his crusty old sports editor gnaw on each other about a 
dozen different things, which isn't all that unusual. What is peculiar, 
however, is that an editor would allow his reporter -- who also triples as a 
columnist, copy editor and photographer -- to become the chief investigator for 
the police and then use his column space to provoke the killer into revealing 
himself. Maybe in Mayberry, R.F.D., but not in New York. 
</P>
<P>
It also doesn't help that, in two books, columnist Burr hasn't written a 
paragraph that is remotely interesting to read. Jim Murray he ain't. 
</P>
<P>
In "Beanball," the George Steinbrenner-like owner of the Brooklyn Bandits is 
killed by a 90-mile-per-hour fastball thrown at him while he is walking in a 
dark tunnel in his stadium. The suspects include the opposing World Series 
managers, a coach, a trainer, a couple of players and Burr himself. 
</P>
<P>
When Burr isn't busy playing detective, he must -- get this -- write a daily 
column, scribble additional sidebars, edit a women's sports section, take 
photographs, defend himself against a sex-discrimination lawsuit, avoid hurled 
hardballs, practice gymnastics and keep his longtime girlfriend from throwing 
him out of their loft. Whew! I guess this explains how only Clark Kent could be 
Superman and a reporter at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Thank goodness the three-time Cy Young Award-winning Seaver was around to 
construct an entertaining World Series battle to distract the reader from all 
the other silliness. The games and players themselves are interesting, and the 
situations -- while highly unlikely -- are resolved with credibility and humor. 
Tarkenton similarly served Resnicow in "Murder at the Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
My favorite blunder in "Beanball" occurs every time Resnicow mentions that the 
Brooklyn "side of the stadium went wild." If pressed, I'm sure Seaver would 
have told him that, in baseball, unlike high school football, a team's fans 
occupy the whole stadium, with a handful of seats set aside for the opponent's 
wives and executives. 
</P>
<P>
A small point, perhaps, but -- compounded by two dozen other, similar groaners 
-- this annoyance made me want to throw the book on the ground and hit it with 
a Louisville Slugger.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE HEARTS AND LIVES OF MEN BY FAY WELDON (DELL PUBLISHING: 
$4.95) 
</P>

<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELENA BRUNET 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Reader, I am going to tell you the story of Clifford, Helen and little Nell," 
begins the narrator of Fay Weldon's inventive, satirical fairy tale. 
</P>
<P>
Helen is an intelligent, pretty 22-year-old who eventually becomes a successful 
fashion designer. Clifford, at 35, is a rising celebrity, a London art dealer 
and charmer who picks up, trades and discards women the way he might works of 
art. They marry, share brief moments of conjugal bliss, then divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Through these rocky circumstances, their daughter Nell is a survivor, even as 
she is kidnaped and later presumed lost in a plane crash. In fact, she is alive 
and provides not only the moral center of the novel but its source of a series 
of picaresque adventures: Nell lands in the clutches of a pair of Satanic 
magicians, only to be placed in a children's home for the emotionally 
disturbed, then taken to a Gypsy commune in Wales. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the precious amulet that she has kept with her all her life 
reunites Nell with her parents, and Clifford and Helen remarry. An imaginative 
work of Dickensian scope set in the '60s.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the winter of 1959, a boy lay on the floor of a South Carolina farm house, 
writhing and bucking with a stomachache, the kind of stomachache a 12-year-old 
gets when he eats too many crab apples. Upon his plea, his puzzled father 
brought in a stick of firewood -- probably ash or hickory, the old man was 
finicky about his firewood -- and put it under the boy's belly. The boy rolled 
back and forth on it and found relief. His father was amazed -- Where'd you get 
that one, boy? 
</P>
<P>
From a book, Pop. 
</P>
<P>
I was that boy, and all these years I have carried within me that remedy for 
stomachaches, as I have carried the book in which I found it: "Lone Cowboy, The 
Autobiography of Will James" (published in 1930). 
</P>
<P>
What a book! Tales of a boyhood spent in the saddle. The author's own 
illustrations of broncs exploding out of a corral and of a trusty cow pony 
tethered near a cabin. 
</P>
<P>
I had spotted it one day as the county bookmobile sat out between the house and 
the barn. My sister was looking for Nancy Drew books and my mother was off 
getting tea for the two plump ladies who took turns driving and dispensing 
books off the back of the truck. 
</P>
<P>
It was not James' first book, nor his most famous, but it led me into his world 
and I was soon pestering the bookmobile ladies to get me more of this man's 
stories about life in the West in the early 1900s. 
</P>
<P>
I have since learned that the best one, "Smoky the Cowhorse" (1929), made James 
an overnight success. It won the John Newbery Medal for juvenile fiction, went 
into numerous printings and was made into a movie three times. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the works of such Western writers as Zane Grey, James' books were not 
about range wars and gun fights. James wrote of the working cowboy, a lanky, 
laconic type who was part athlete, part working stiff. 
</P>
<P>
They were straightforward yarns about trail driving and breaking horses; about 
making camp under a big Western sky and waking to the smell of cowboy coffee; 
about knowing that there is only one other animal on Earth you can absolutely 
trust -- your horse. 
</P>
<P>
The early chapters of "Lone Cowboy" described how James was orphaned in Montana 
at age 4 and how he was reared by a family friend named Jean Beaupre, a 
French-Canadian trapper. 
</P>
<P>
Young Will and "Bopy," as he called his guardian, lived like wild geese, 
drifting from Canada to Mexico with the seasons. They trapped in the winter and 
prospected in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
The book was full of practical, if eccentric, lore. How do you get the scent of 
death off a steel trap? You soak it in lye. 
</P>
<P>
Lye was also what gave Will James a stomachache that nearly killed him. His 
youthful curiosity led him to take a swig of the stuff when he spotted it on a 
cabin shelf. 
</P>
<P>
It took all winter for Will to recover from the lye's scarring of his stomach. 
Rolling around on a log eased the pain. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Bopy taught Will to ride, track, shoot, trap and skin. He even 
taught him to read, using old magazines found in some of the cabins they used. 
</P>
<P>
One day Bopy disappeared, presumably drowned in a creek swollen from the spring 
thaw, and after that young Will took up with some cowboys and became one of the 
best bronc busters around. His self-taught drawing and painting also flourished 
and the rest of the book is taken up with those subjects. 
</P>
<P>
As I read James' autobiography in South Carolina, stuck as I was on a farm with 
barbed-wire fences and a docile herd of Angus, well, you can imagine how the 
story of his childhood excited me. 
</P>
<P>
It was unforgettable. 
</P>
<P>
And it was untrue. 
</P>
<P>
When I found that out the other day I wanted to get down and roll around on a 
log. 
</P>
<P>
Most of "Lone Cowboy" was autobiographical. But the first part, the best part, 
was made up. 
</P>
<P>
I learned this from another book I came upon by chance: "Ride for the High 
Points: The Real Story of Will James," written by Jim Bramlett and published in 
1987 by Mountain Press of Missoula, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
I got so worked up about the revelation in Bramlett's book that I tracked him 
down. He's a working cowboy, sculptor and artist and lives on a ranch in Ft. 
Bragg on California's north coast. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why James made that up," Bramlett said in a telephone interview. 
"But my guess is that he didn't think a cowboy who was suddenly famous for his 
writing and drawing, and who was being published by Scribner's back East, my 
guess is a man like that didn't think he could admit to his true origins." 
</P>
<P>
As Bramlett's book explains, Will James' real name was Joseph Ernest Nephtali 
Dufault. He was born into a middle-class family in Quebec in 1892, displayed a 
gift for drawing before he was 5 and fell in love with the American West by 
reading pulp fiction. 
</P>
<P>
In 1907, when he was 15, young Dufault kissed his parents goodby and set off 
for western Canada, where he began to learn the cow-punching trade. He drifted 
into the United States, using various aliases to rid himself of his 
French-Canadian ties before finally settling on Will James. 
</P>
<P>
He did in fact become a first-class bronc rider and cowboy, and he left his 
drawings of horses and cowpokes all over outhouses and bunkhouses from Saco, 
Mont., to Tonopah, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
Barely literate in English, James never dreamed he would be a writer. He 
figured when his bronc-busting days were over, he would become a famous Western 
artist like Remington and Russell. 
</P>
<P>
But his art wasn't selling, and in the 1920s, Alice Conradt, the Nevada girl he 
had married, persuaded him to start writing down the stories he loved to tell 
of his drifter days. He sent the first one off, with illustrations, to 
Scribner's Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The writing had been so easy, he was convinced nothing would come of it. 
Instead, a $300 check came back with a request for more. The stuffy East was 
mad for cowboy stories, as it turned out. James gradually moved from stories to 
books and his editor was none other than Maxwell Perkins, the man who edited 
Fitzgerald, Hemingway and Wolfe. 
</P>
<P>
By 1930, the success of "Smoky" had allowed James to buy a ranch outside 
Billings, Mont. But there was also pressure to keep the success going, and 
James switched from being a classic, cowboy binge-drinker to being a steady 
boozer. Afraid that his fans would learn the truth about his origins, he made a 
trip to Canada and swore his relatives to secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
Despite some good days on his Rocking R ranch in Montana, he gradually withdrew 
from his wife and friends and nearly lost the deed to the ranch while on one of 
his benders. 
</P>
<P>
For the tragic end of my hero, Bramlett urged me to read another book, also 
published in 1987: "Will James: The Life and Works of a Lone Cowboy," written 
by William Gardner Bell and published by Northland Press of Flagstaff, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
I debated closing down all my research into the real Will James at that point. 
But my morbid curiosity won out. I found Bell's book. 
</P>
<P>
To my amazement, Bell writes that James lived his last years near where I live 
in Hollywood. In a rented house on Ivarene Avenue he worked on movie ideas and 
finished his final book, "The American Cowboy." 
</P>
<P>
But mostly he drank. When Alice, long estranged, came to visit, she hardly 
recognized him. He didn't ask about any of the people he had been close to in 
Montana. In 1942, at age 50, he died in Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
It's a funny thing about books. Sometimes they tell you things you could have 
gone forever without knowing. That's sort of where I am after all these 
revelations about Will James. 
</P>
<P>
But I should also add that I'm on the lookout for some copies of "Smoky" and 
"Lone Cowboy." One day I'll give them to my son.

POVERTY IN CITIES MORE PERSISTENT, NEW STUDY SHOWS

<P>
Poverty in America's cities has grown more persistent, with its victims having 
less chance of escape, according to a report by the National League of Cities. 
</P>
<P>
The study describes a changing face of poverty since 1970, with the nation's 
poor more likely now to live in metropolitan areas. 
</P>
<P>
The league released its report, "Poverty in Cities," as nearly 3,000 municipal 
leaders gathered in Washington for the organization's annual winter meeting, 
which runs through Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Both the figures and the trends are alarming," Alan Beals, executive director 
of the National League of Cities, said in releasing the report. "Such 
conditions are devastating for those caught up in it, especially children." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Notes Poverty Resurgence 
</P>
<P>
The report, an analysis and compilation of previous research, said poverty in 
America declined through much of the 1970s, to a rate of less than 12% at the 
end of the decade. But a resurgence brought the rate to more than 15% by 1985, 
and the average rate for the years 1980 through 1987 was more than 14%, the 
league said. 
</P>
<P>
The portion of the nation's poor living in metropolitan areas grew from 62% in 
1979 to 70% in 1985 -- an increase of 7.6 million people, it said. 
</P>
<P>
The report said the persistence of poverty -- that is, the length of time a 
person remains poor -- has grown. 
</P>
<P>
Called the "escape probability," the figure in the mid-1970s rose to 37 out of 
100 who escaped poverty within a year, meaning that poverty became less 
persistent. But the figure began declining and was 23 out of 100 by the early 
1980s.

In a continuation of violence in the District of Columbia, four people, 
including a well-known gang member, were killed and five others were wounded by 
gunfire during a 9 1/2-hour period that ended early Saturday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The slayings, most of which occurred in drug-trafficking neighborhoods, brought 
the number of homicides in the district this year to 107, nearly double the 
number killed in the equivalent period of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide detectives said the pace of the attacks, which averaged one shooting 
an hour -- was unusual. The death toll exceeded that of Feb. 14, when three 
people were killed and 10 others were wounded within 24 hours that officials 
called the bloodiest episode in memory.

WEATHER FORECAST: IT'S IN THE (TIMES) BAG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re meteorology-Orange County: I am bemused by the weather antics on television 
of Doctor George, Willard Scott, et al., as they are almost invariably "wrong." 
</P>
<P>
For the 20 years I have lived in Anaheim, Orange, Irvine and Newport Beach, I 
have found a far more reliable forecaster of weather: my Los Angeles Times 
delivery person! 
</P>
<P>
If, when I walk out to the driveway to retrieve my Times, it is in a plastic 
cover, I know we will have rain in the near future -- and dress accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
If the good doctor and Willard forecast rain, and my Times is unwrapped, I 
dress for a fine and clear day. 
</P>
<P>

ABORTION DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Let's get our terms straight: In today's controversy we use the misnomer 
"pro-life" to mean those who oppose the right to a legal abortion. Stated 
accurately, this small group of people is anti-choice. 
</P>
<P>
I saw them in action at a clinic in Orange, these religious zealots who call 
themselves right-to-lifers, who want to be thought of as super-humane. They are 
not even decent: Their cruel harassment of each woman entering the clinic -- 
surrounding her car the minute it arrived, pushing themselves up to her as she 
walked, shouting taunts in her face -- sought not to protect but to destroy her 
right to life, and her right to liberty and the pursuit of happiness too. 
</P>
<P>
Properly stated, these fanatics are pro-force -- determined to force their 
narrow beliefs on everyone else. Let's use the right words, and know them for 
what they are.

<P>
'CLUSTERING' IS THE KEY TO CONVENIENT LIVING 20 YEARS DOWN THE ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN OLLEN, John Ollen is vice president and resident manager of the Laguna 
Hills' office of Coldwell Banker Commercial Real Estate Services. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stepping out of his town home, he notices the mallard ducks on Lake Santa 
Margarita. Once a less common sight, wild fowl are now showing up at the lake 
in greater numbers because of the significant reduction in air pollution over 
the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
He eases himself into his light alloy photovoltaic, battery-operated street 
cruiser and makes his way to the Foothill Transportation Corridor. As he passes 
a toll booth, his trip is automatically recorded from a sensor on the left 
fender of his vehicle. He is billed for his trips at the end of each month. 
</P>
<P>
Once on the freeway, he begins reading a financial journal, paying little 
attention to the road. His route is programmed and, utilizing electromagnetic 
sensors on the road, his vehicle will whisk him to his office at the Irvine 
Spectrum Commercial Complex in just 4 minutes. A bond salesman, he takes a 
high-speed elevator to his 15th-floor office. 
</P>
<P>
Later, meeting clients for lunch, he walks (others take the people mover) 
across a bridge connecting Towers I and III of the office complex. Tower III is 
devoted to retail, with nine restaurants, 11 stores, cleaning and other service 
shops, a fitness center and entertainment outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Back at the office in the afternoon he will hold a teleconference linking 
offices in Tokyo, London, New York and Rio de Janeiro. At 6 p.m. he completes a 
45-minute workout at the Tower I gymnasium, using computer-programmed exercise 
machines. His day ends with a client meeting over cocktails. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, his weekdays are carried out within 8 miles of his home. When he 
does need to make a trip to San Diego, Newport Beach or Los Angeles, he uses a 
larger, more comfortable freeway cruiser designed for higher speeds and longer 
trips. It, too, has photovoltaic capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a page from a science-fiction novel. Rather, it is a chapter of 
science future, a glimpse of what I think Orange County life will resemble in 
the year 2009. And the changes that will occur tomorrow will be the result of 
trends that are occurring today. Commercial real estate development is 
responsible for such trends and will be instrumental in making our lives more 
comfortable, efficient and economical. 
</P>
<P>
Our bond seller's average day represents what I believe will be an average day 
for most Orange County business people in the next century. His ability to live 
and work in close proximity, to travel quickly and conveniently in electric 
vehicles and to utilize sky bridges and people movers will be the result of the 
intelligent and advanced commercial planning and development that is now 
occurring in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
At the forefront of futuristic development is a concept called "clustering." 
Designed to allow individuals to work, play and live in their immediate 
environment, clustering is the development of planned business parks and 
mixed-use facilities to reduce commuting time and freeway congestion. 
</P>
<P>
With clustering, high-rise offices and homes will predominate the landscape, 
with work and entertainment complexes located within walking or short commute 
distances to planned living communities. The toll freeways will be used 
sparingly for long trips, while transportation corridors will be used for 
programmed routes for quick and efficient transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Clustering is actually a corporate extension of a domestic trend known as 
"cocooning," which has seen families spending more of their free time at home 
or in their immediate environment. This social trend increases the importance 
of amenities and entertainment close to home, and has spawned the emergence of 
planned communities and mixed-use developments. 
</P>
<P>
Planned communities in Orange County such as Woodbridge, Westpark, Santa 
Margarita, Tustin Ranch and Mission Viejo have focused on this concept and 
emphasized homes, shopping and entertainment in the development and marketing 
of their communities. 
</P>
<P>
On the commercial side, clustering is evidenced in developments such as North 
Irvine, The Spectrum, Pacific Park and Santa Margarita Business Park, and will 
be central to the proposed Horno and Foothill Ranch projects. For maximum 
clustering, these projects are near the planned residential communities I 
mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
A desirable work and living environment is highly sought by major companies 
today and is one of the main reasons corporations such as Western Digital and 
AT&amp;T have moved to the Irvine Spectrum. With such corporate support, the 
concept of building work centers near the work force will continue to gain 
acceptance and result in additional clustered development. 
</P>
<P>
The positive benefits of clustering, both to residents and the environment, 
ensure that it is a significant and far-reaching trend. Today's clustered 
commercial development is shaping the Orange County of tomorrow and leading us 
toward the next century. It will have a direct and beneficial effect on our 
life styles and help determine the course of our "average" day in the year 
2009.

HOMELESS NEED MORE THAN JUST LIP SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County Grand Jury has issued a stinging indictment charging that 
neither the public sector nor the private sector is keeping up with the 
fast-growing problem of homeless families in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The charge is well-founded, especially when leveled against public officials. 
There are still far too few shelter beds and, despite a previous jury 
recommendation, government agencies are not coordinating their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
It is not that people are unaware of the plight of the homeless. Recent surveys 
show that the visibility of the homeless and recognition of their circumstances 
have risen dramatically in the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
In The Times Orange County Poll, seven out of every 10 people surveyed agreed 
that homelessness is a problem. And three out of four people in a national poll 
echoed the same charge made by the county grand jury: that local government has 
not shown enough concern for the homeless. Nearly half of the people polled 
said they would pay more taxes to help the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
But still the county's homeless ranks keep growing. Estimates place the total 
at about 5,000, with possibly one-third of them families with children. Many of 
the homeless are also single women, some with children, and a good number of 
the people on the street have jobs but not enough income to scrape together the 
deposits needed to rent housing. 
</P>
<P>
The county supervisors will have an opportunity to help ease that problem 
Tuesday when they consider a proposal made last week by Supervisor Roger R. 
Stanton. He suggested that the county and cities put some of the federal 
housing money they receive into a countywide pool. The money would be used to 
build transitional housing where homeless people could live until they saved 
enough money to rent a home. 
</P>
<P>
That is a critically needed approach that should be pursued. No one local 
agency can adequately do the job alone. It makes sense to join forces and 
attack the problem that all face and should be trying to solve. 
</P>
<P>
In search of that better coordination, the grand jury also recommended that the 
county board appoint a full-time coordinator for the homeless. The supervisors 
responded Tuesday by deciding to assign a county employee to work with public 
and private efforts dealing with the homeless. They will also explore the 
creation of a full-time position devoted to homeless issues. 
</P>
<P>
There is a glaring lack of leadership and coordination in developing both 
immediate and long-term resources that the right full-time coordinator could do 
much to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
Another grand jury suggestion worth heeding urges the supervisors to work with 
the county League of Cities in helping private organizations "with zoning 
ordinances and permit procedures for shelters and soup kitchens." Local 
government should go one step further and streamline those procedures, as well 
as making available vacant public buildings, parking lots and unused property 
for overnight housing. 
</P>
<P>
But the difficulty in providing those facilities was seen in Costa Mesa last 
week when a soup kitchen that has been feeding about 150 hungry people each day 
was ordered closed by the City Council. Residents around the community center 
where the kitchen was located complained about the "undesirables" that the soup 
kitchen and the Share Our Selves service group at the center are attracting. 
</P>
<P>
Homelessness is not a problem easily solved. But it is growing in far greater 
proportion than the community's response to it. Orange County is one of the 
most affluent areas of the nation. It is time that it finally mobilized its 
ample resources and coordinated efforts to help the homeless -- instead of just 
paying lip service to their plight, making value judgments on who they are and 
trying to close down projects that are truly trying to make a difference.

REPRODUCTIVE CURBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Similar to the child who cannot come to grips with a difficult problem, our 
government and its people sidestep the major issue behind the minor ones. Lost 
in an ever-mounting sea of bureaucracy, we try to solve problems like 
pollution, traffic congestion, housing shortages, crime and drug abuse. These 
problems can never be properly dealt with until we the people elect public 
officials who have the intestinal fortitude to deal with the crisis situation 
of overpopulation. 
</P>
<P>
Why can't we face the fact that we must control our reproductive urges? We had 
better take responsible action to slow the inevitable decline of the United 
States. As a starter, we could try tax incentives for the childless wage 
earner.

PAY INCREASES AT SADDLEBACK COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There they go again. At their meeting of Feb. 6, the Saddleback College 
District trustees voted to grant healthy salary increases for 1988-89 to 
administrators, while some instructional programs are still on a strict diet. 
</P>
<P>
The 4.7% cost of living increase (retroactive to July 1, 1988) probably 
reflects the actual inflation in this area. But in addition, the trustees voted 
a $200-per-month car allowance for all "Category 1 vice-presidents." An outside 
observer might reasonably conclude from the trustees' actions that the 
Saddleback College District budget is plump and will likely remain so (salary 
adjustments are permanent fixtures in all future budgets). 
</P>
<P>
But in the Saddleback College reading program, the picture painted by the 
administration is quite different: The reading lab, where students are required 
to improve their skills as part of their course work, has had to be closed all 
afternoons and Fridays. The reason: no funds to pay for a lab instructor to 
help students. It is the same old story in many school districts: plenty of 
money for management, while funds for direct instruction are lacking. The 
trustees claim they are only bringing the Saddleback District administrative 
salaries and perks in line with those of our neighboring colleges. Can we 
suppose that the reasoning is that if their administrative spending is bloated, 
ours should also be at least as bloated as theirs? 
</P>
<P>
We certainly have no objection to cost-of-living increases for employees of the 
district, but the trustees' priorities are certainly open to question when they 
grant $200-per-month car allowances to vice presidents who already earn more 
than the highest paid professor with 30 years of service.

EXPECTANT MOTHERS WHO TAKE DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A little girl died today and it wasn't her fault. She was innocent and didn't 
even know what death was all about. It was her parents' fault. No, the parents 
did not beat her, nor did they starve her; matter of fact, she had been taken 
care of at the hospital where she was born with all the interest, care and love 
that any one person can give. But her parents still killed her. 
</P>
<P>
What killed her then? Drugs! Her mother took drugs while she was pregnant. Yes, 
it's hard to believe that someone would be that stupid, but she was. Her taking 
drugs caused the baby to be born without an esophagus and a bad heart. The 
doctors tried to help but with all their gifts, it was to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
I am not writing this letter to tell a story. Unfortunately this goes on all 
the time. I'm writing this letter because it is high time that the law starts 
prosecuting mothers for murder who take drugs, smoke or drink during pregnancy, 
and cause their babies to die! Maybe these pro-life people should be looking at 
all aspects of "pro-life."

RACISM AND ANTI-SEMITISM IN THE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing to clarify what I think about anti-Semitism and discrimination in 
Orange County. In the Feb. 13 edition of The Times, I was quoted on these 
issues in such a way that my observations and conclusions could be easily 
misinterpreted. In the March 5 Letters to the Editor, there was just such a 
misreading of my opinions by Stephen Lawton. 
</P>
<P>
First, in response to Lawton, I never said that there was no anti-Semitism in 
Orange County, and nothing could be further from the truth or my opinion. There 
is a significant amount of anti-Semitism in our community. It has been here for 
a long time, it is troubling, and it must be confronted wherever it rears its 
head. Anti-Semitism is ugly, unfair and ubiquitous, as are other forms of 
bigotry. It judges people not on their merits but on their religion. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Human Relations Commission is dedicated to the elimination of 
prejudice, intolerance and discrimination. We have a laudable record of 
aggressive response to anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry. 
</P>
<P>
One of the key ways we overcome bigotry is to bring together people from 
different groups around their common interests. Nothing is more effective than 
firsthand personal contact to shatter stereotypes, break down prejudice and 
build understanding. The commission works diligently in the varied communities 
of Orange County to help people understand those who are different and to have 
respect for other groups' customs and beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to document and respond to hate violence, the commission is 
working with all Orange County police departments to establish a protocol for 
defining and handling hate incidents. The Harmony Festival in Westminster was a 
positive pro-active program initiated by our commission to overcome hate 
incidents perpetrated against blacks, Jews and others. 
</P>
<P>
The black and Jewish communities of our county come together in a dialogue that 
we sponsor with the American Jewish Committee to help counter some of the 
strained relations that developed over the last few years. The commission also 
sponsored a similar dialogue between Arabs and Jews. 
</P>
<P>
In a sweeping prejudice-reduction program titled "A World of Difference," our 
commission joins the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith to utilize the 
electronic media to teach about respect for differences between people. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County has been known as an all-white bastion of bigotry. Over the last 
10 years there have been dramatic changes in the ethnic makeup of the county. 
Today it is a diverse urban community where there is still too much racism, 
bigotry and anti-Semitism. BUT, there are important steps that have been taken 
to combat this bigotry, and one of the significant efforts has been the 
establishment and continued funding of the Orange County Human Relations 
Commission by the Orange County Board of Supervisors. In establishing the 
commission, the board set out to "eliminate prejudice, intolerance and 
discrimination" in Orange County. Our commission is seen as one of the most 
effective in the state of California. 
</P>
<P>
It is part of our job in Orange County to put out the word that this is a 
community where anti-Semitism, racism and bigotry are not welcome, and where 
the top political leadership is willing to take action to eliminate them. This 
is our charge. It is in trying to get out this message that I have been 
misunderstood to be minimizing the level of anti-Semitism, racism and bigotry.

ONCE PAINED BY HER HERITAGE, AMY TAN HAS TAPPED IT FOR A PIERCING FIRST NOVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE WOO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The minute our train leaves the Hong Kong border and enters Shenzhen, China, I 
feel different. I can feel the skin on my forehead tingling, my blood rushing 
through a new course, my bones aching with a familiar old pain. And I think, My 
mother was right. . . . Once you are born Chinese, you cannot help but feel and 
think Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someday you will see," my mother said. "It is in your blood, waiting to be 
let go." 
</P>
<P>
 And when she said this, I saw myself transforming like a werewolf, a mutant 
tag of DNA . . . a cluster of telltale Chinese behaviors, all those things my 
mother did to embarrass me. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 -- From "The Joy Luck Club," by Amy Tan 
</P>
<P>
Amy Tan, the daughter of Chinese immigrants, remembers yearning to be "100% 
American" when she was growing up. 
</P>
<P>
As a girl, she tried to re-contour her "too Chinese" nose by crimping it with a 
clothespin. 
</P>
<P>
Years later, when she was doing free-lance writing, she shunned her own name 
for the decidedly non-Chinese-sounding pseudonym, "May Brown." 
</P>
<P>
"Like a lot of Chinese-American children," she said recently, "I grew up with a 
lot of self-hate." 
</P>
<P>
But all that is in the past. These days, says this Oakland-born, former 
business-writer-turned-novelist, she feels mostly exhilaration and pride. 
</P>
<P>
Tan, 37, has penned "The Joy Luck Club," a lavishly praised first novel about 
the contradictions of growing up Chinese and American that seems headed for 
commercial as well as critical success. 
</P>
<P>
Expected in bookstores March 22, "The Joy Luck Club" refers to a social and 
investment circle formed by four Chinese immigrant women living in modern-day 
San Francisco. Written as a chain of 16 short stories, it alternates between 
the voices of the four mothers, who are linked by tradition and past 
adversities, and their four "thirtysomething"-generation daughters who struggle 
with demanding careers, shaky marriages and bicultural angst. 
</P>
<P>
With flashes of puckish humor (one character jokes, for instance, that telling 
a Chinese mother to shut up would be tantamount to being "an accessory to your 
own murder"), it delves into cultural clashes, inter-generational conflicts and 
the complexities of the mother-daughter bond in language that reviewers have 
described as "intensely poetic," "inordinately moving" and "electric." 
</P>
<P>
Magazine serial rights have been purchased by Ladies Home Journal and the 
Atlantic. The Book-of-the-Month Club has made it this month's featured 
alternate selection. Foreign editions are forthcoming in Britain, France, Italy 
and the Netherlands. A paperback house has set a six-figure floor on the 
bidding for softcover rights. And there is talk of a movie deal. 
</P>
<P>
G. P. Putnam's Sons, which is publishing the book, paid Tan a $50,000 advance 
-- about five times higher than the standard advance for first novels. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Putnam's clinched the deal after seeing only three of Tan's short 
stories, which editor Faith Sale says was most unusual. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Very Special Vision' 
</P>
<P>
"I had the sense that this was something I did not want to let go of," Sale 
explained recently from New York. "Amy has a very special vision . . . that is 
so tremendously moving. I have this feeling every time I read one of (her) 
stories of being pierced somewhere in my innards." 
</P>
<P>
Reviewers have made the inevitable comparisons of Tan to Maxine Hong-Kingston, 
who was the first Chinese-American to write a best seller that was also 
considered a literary success -- the 1976 novel "The Woman Warrior." 
</P>
<P>
But William Tay, a professor of Chinese and comparative literature at UC San 
Diego, who has read an advance copy of "The Joy Luck Club," says the novel's 
focus on two contemporary generations of Chinese in America sets it apart from 
works by Hong-Kingston and other Chinese-American writers. 
</P>
<P>
"She has a common-sensical, down-to-earth, ordinary way of looking at Chinese 
and their cultural heritage that . . . transcends the more standard Chinatown 
ghetto stories," Tay said. 
</P>
<P>
Tan lives in a gentrified neighborhood of antique shops and Victorian 
residences in San Francisco's Presidio Heights area with her husband of 15 
years, tax attorney Lou DeMattei. 
</P>
<P>
She spends most days at home, the bottom floor of an 80-year-old house that 
they renovated and co-own with another couple. Tan works on an IBM computer in 
a spacious basement office, escaping, she says, only to go bookstore browsing 
when she gets writer's block. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent afternoon, Tan was sitting on a plush sofa in a living room 
cluttered with books and mementos, her 13-year-old cat named Sagwa (pronounced 
Sah-gwah, an affectionate Mandarin term meaning "stupid," she says) curled up 
beside her. Striking in a silky purple jacket, short black skirt and black 
stockings, Tan seemed composed and relaxed. She laughs easily -- in wheezing 
bursts -- and has a sly sense of humor. Sale describes her as "precise, 
punctual and gracious," traits that she says set Tan apart from many of the 
first-time novelists she has dealt with. 
</P>
<P>
Tan likes to quip that what led her to fiction writing was "bad psychiatry." It 
was about 1983, and she was doing free-lance writing for corporations such as 
Bank of America and Pacific Bell. When friends told her she was a workaholic 
and should consult a shrink, she did -- for about six months. But she ended the 
therapy, she said, after the doctor "fell asleep about three times." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of getting depressed, she decided to cure herself of her work addiction 
by setting two outside goals: The first was to learn to play jazz piano, and 
the second was to write a short story. 
</P>
<P>
The result of the latter enterprise was "Rules of the Game," a story she wrote 
in 1985 about a female chess prodigy and her clashes with her mother. The story 
earned Tan a place in the Squaw Valley Community of Writers, a fiction writers' 
workshop run by novelist and UC Irvine writing professor Oakley Hall. Her 
teacher there, writer Molly Giles, introduced her to literary agent Sandra 
Dijkstra. 
</P>
<P>
"She sent me a story," Dijkstra, whose office is in Del Mar, recalled recently, 
"and she sent me her vitae, which was very, very impressive. At that point, I 
thought, 'The first story is wonderful; with a flick of her wrist, she could 
write a novel.' " 
</P>
<P>
Tan wrote two more stories and mailed them off to Dijkstra. In late 1987, the 
agent called her with the news that she had started shopping for a publisher 
and that several prominent New York publishing houses were eagerly bidding for 
the rights to what was then a far-from-finished book. 
</P>
<P>
"I was completely stunned," Tan recalled. "I became depressed afterward. It was 
such a wonderful thing, yet it seemed my life was no longer under my control." 
</P>
<P>
She hastily shut down her free-lance business in order to devote full-time to 
finishing the novel, writing most of "The Joy Luck Club" in about four months. 
</P>
<P>
"I wrote it very quickly because I was afraid this chance would just slip out 
of my hands," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Tan said she decided on a mother-daughter theme when her mother suffered a 
heart attack, forcing her to consider the possibility of her mother's dying 
before she got to know her better. 
</P>
<P>
"I realized there were so many things I didn't know about her," she mused. "I 
decided maybe this will be a good outlet for writing . . . to try to capture 
the feeling of what she's been trying to say to me all these years." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family Tragedies 
</P>
<P>
Her mother, who came from a wealthy Shanghai family and worked nights as a 
nurse, was a central force in Tan's life, particularly after a double tragedy 
struck the family, Tan said. 
</P>
<P>
Both her father, an electrical engineer from Peking who became a Baptist 
minister, and her older brother developed brain tumors when she was 15. She 
spent much of that year in Bay Area hospitals, she said, horrified to be a 
witness to their dying and awed by her mother's unstinting belief that they 
could be saved. At one point, her mother brought in Pentecostal faith healers 
to save them, but her father and brother died six months apart. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after their deaths, her mother took extraordinary action: She abandoned 
their "diseased house" in Santa Clara on the advice of relatives and left the 
country. With Tan, then 16, and a younger son, John, she booked passage on a 
boat to the Netherlands, eventually settling the family in Montreux, 
Switzerland, where they knew not a soul. 
</P>
<P>
It was a trying time. 
</P>
<P>
"I did a bunch of crazy things" there, Tan said, an impish grin on her face. 
That included nearly running away to marry a German man whom she later 
discovered was a fugitive from a mental hospital. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Went to Pieces' 
</P>
<P>
"My mother . . . thought I should be even better as a daughter because of what 
had happened to her family. Instead, I just kind of went to pieces." 
</P>
<P>
After about a year, they moved back to the United States. With scholarships and 
odd jobs, Tan worked her way through seven years of college, ending up with a 
masters in linguistics from California State University at San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
Her first job was as a language consultant for the Alameda County Assn. for 
Retarded Citizens. After five years, she switched careers, becoming a writer of 
educational newsletters for doctors and later a free-lance business writer. 
</P>
<P>
The strand of the novel that opens and closes the book tells of a daughter's 
attempts to fulfill her dead mother's wish that she go to China to find her 
half-sisters. To some degree, it was inspired by the real-life pains Tan's 
mother took to be reunited with three daughters from a first marriage whom she 
left in China. 
</P>
<P>
For reasons that Tan says her mother would prefer to keep private, she could 
not take the three daughters with her when she immigrated to the United States 
in 1949. Nearly 40 years later, in 1987, Tan accompanied her mother to Shanghai 
and Beijing for the long-overdue reunion. 
</P>
<P>
For Tan, who had never been to China, the trip helped melt away all the 
conflicts she had ever felt about being Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
"It was instant bonding," she said. "There was something about this country 
that I belonged to. I found something about myself that I never knew was 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Looking back at her life, she said, she appreciates a lesson her parents, 
particularly her mother, taught her. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a line in the book, but this was what their thinking was: They wanted 
us to have American circumstances and Chinese character," Tan said quietly. "We 
should always think like a Chinese person but we should always speak perfect 
English so we can take advantage of circumstances" and assimilate into the 
mainstream of America. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Finding Balance' 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I started to think about any of this until I started to write 
the book. . . . I think what I was trying to find was how can you have the best 
of both worlds; how can you keep your Chinese face and keep your American face 
and not hide anything and not be dishonest. I think for me personally the book 
is a lot about finding balance." 
</P>
<P>
Now, in between juggling interviews and book parties, Tan is trying to decide 
which of three ideas to pursue for her next novel. One is set in the 1930s, one 
at the turn of the century, and one in the present. And all draw on her Chinese 
heritage, but she says that is where their resemblance to "The Joy Luck Club" 
will end. 
</P>
<P>
"I refuse," she said with a flash of stubborn determination, "to write 'Son of 
Joy Luck'! I want to do something completely different."

PHILHARMONIC SOCIETY OVERCAME SOME SPECIAL OBSTACLES TO EVOLVE INTO THE 
COUNTY'S SHOWCASE CONCERT PRESENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For 35 years, the Orange County Philharmonic Society has been the premier music 
organization in the county, presenting major orchestras, conductors and 
soloists from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
This week, in a special blaze of glory, the society will present Michael Tilson 
Thomas and the London Symphony on Monday, Sir Colin Davis and the Bavarian 
Symphony of Munich on Wednesday, and Zubin Mehta and the Israel Philharmonic on 
Saturday. All three concerts will take place at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
But where did this organization get its start? 
</P>
<P>
It all goes back to one woman, 83-year-old conductor, cellist and teacher 
Frieda Belinfante of Laguna Beach. "If it hadn't been for her, I don't think 
there would even have been an Orange County Philharmonic Society," says 
longtime board member Camille Durand. 
</P>
<P>
A resistance fighter against the Nazis in her native Holland, Belinfante came 
to the United States in 1947, moved to Laguna Beach in 1948, and commuted to 
UCLA to teach cello and conducting. 
</P>
<P>
"In those days, there was really nothing cultural in Orange County," she said 
recently. "We started everything at that time, in 1954." 
</P>
<P>
Belinfante formed a professional orchestra made up of "the best free-lance 
players in Los Angeles, who had done recordings with Bruno Walter," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She called the group the Orange County Philharmonic, and conducted it for the 
first time on May 22, 1954, at Santa Ana High School. The program included the 
Overture to Rossini's "The Barber of Seville," Mozart's Symphony No. 38, 
Mendelssohn's Incidental Music to "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and Beethoven 
Symphony No. 1. About 150 attended. 
</P>
<P>
After a second concert, at the Irvine Bowl in Laguna Beach 3 months later, she 
was approached by a group of friends who wanted to ensure that the orchestra 
would become a permanent part of the community. A series of winter concerts was 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
Thus was the society born. 
</P>
<P>
But changes lay ahead. The orchestra played all over the county -- in 
Fullerton, Garden Grove, Anaheim and Costa Mesa -- but it would last only until 
1961. 
</P>
<P>
A woman conductor was an anomaly in the 1950s, and Belinfante was resented in 
some quarters of the community. 
</P>
<P>
"Frieda was a fine musician -- she is a fine musician -- but the community did 
not accept her," board member Durand recalls. "I do remember some chauvinists 
who said, 'Well, who wants to go to a concert and watch the back of a woman 
ripple up and down?' " 
</P>
<P>
Male chauvinism was not the only obstacle faced by the young organization. "We 
had to be very careful about programming Russian music," said Durand, who was 
on the programming committee. "We had ticket cancellations because we were 
playing Tchaikovsky -- or any Russian composer. This was a very reactionary 
county. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"But we tried to sneak in as much as we possibly could." 
</P>
<P>
At first, the concerts were free. But even that created problems, recalls Lucy 
Gaynor, another longtime board member of the society. 
</P>
<P>
"Because the concerts were free, people did not support them very well," she 
said. "It was a psychological thing there. People may not think they are worth 
much if you aren't charging for them. 
</P>
<P>
"So we tried to put them together in a more businesslike way and began to 
charge for performances. But then we ran into problems with the (musicians') 
union." 
</P>
<P>
The union refused to allow its members to continue donating their rehearsal 
time. Costs began to skyrocket, and some concerts had to be canceled. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember when I was chairman of the youth concerts, which was pretty early 
on," Gaynor said, "a Saturday concert had been canceled the day before. I sat 
in front of the high school, (telling) the few students who showed up. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the way it was then. The society was very personalized. I was the 
only one in the office for many years. I was office manager, I signed checks, 
kept the books and did everything before we were really professional." 
</P>
<P>
Gaynor remembers that money came in from volunteer women's groups -- which to 
this day are the backbone of the organization. More than 1,500 community 
members now provide volunteer services through about 30 committees. 
</P>
<P>
By 1960, problems began to snowball. Concert attendance was proving erratic, 
and the availability of core orchestra musicians had diminished as the movie 
industry in Hollywood slumped, still feeling the effects of television. 
</P>
<P>
The coup de grace was delivered when the Los Angeles Philharmonic decided to 
expand its touring dates in the Southland, offering to put on concerts at half 
of what it cost the society to maintain its own orchestra, according to 
Belinfante. The board decided to abort the orchestra in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
Belinfante protested. " 'You don't have to hire me,' I said, 'but for God's 
sake don't give up your orchestra.' " She recommended Daniel Lewis, Maurice 
Abravanel or a then-relatively unknown Zubin Mehta as her successor. 
</P>
<P>
But her wish was in vain and, as Belinfante remembers, the bylaws were 
rewritten in 1962 so that the group could act as a booking agency, presenting 
outside orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
Belinfante wasn't the only one upset. There were people who argued that 
importing "world-class" orchestras would undercut any efforts to establish an 
orchestra of the county's own. 
</P>
<P>
In at least one instance, that turned out to be the case. A "Symphony Orchestra 
of Orange County" was established in Anaheim in 1962, conducted by Eugene Ober, 
who was succeeded by Daniel Lewis in 1967. But it folded in 1969, when it was 
unable to raise $40,000 to complete its season of six remaining concerts. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Philharmonic Society, however, began to thrive in its new 
mission, bringing in the Los Angeles Philharmonic on a regular basis, along 
with major orchestras from Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, London, Amsterdam 
and Rotterdam, among other cities. 
</P>
<P>
Subscriptions, which had averaged around 1,000, had doubled by the end of the 
society's second decade and continued to rise, as listeners were drawn by such 
conductors as Erich Leinsdorf, Carlo Maria Giulini, Pierre Boulez and Rafael 
Kubelic. 
</P>
<P>
Major performers included violinists Isaac Stern and Itzhak Perlman and 
pianists Alicia de Larrocha and Martha Argerich. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the society proved intent upon building future audiences 
through youth programs, begun in 1956. The society has reached approximately 3 
million young people to date, second-graders through high school students, from 
more than 400 schools. 
</P>
<P>
While audiences grew, the society's major problem seemed to be finding an 
adequate venue. 
</P>
<P>
Peg Reday, a Newport Beach resident who has been a society subscriber for 30 
years, remembers "following (the society) around from UCI to Santa Ana High 
School and (finally) to the Center." 
</P>
<P>
Plans for the Performing Arts Center were announced in the early 1970s, and 
with them came a whole new set of challenges, not the least of which was the 
need to fill a hall twice the size of what the society was used to. The board 
decided it was time for professional management, and Robert Elias was hired in 
December of 1983 as its first executive director. 
</P>
<P>
Within 9 months, though, Elias left to become executive director of the 
Pasadena-based Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, where he had served as assistant 
manager from 1979-81. Erich Vollmer, the society's current executive director, 
came on board in November, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
How had the society managed to work for so many years without a professional 
director? 
</P>
<P>
"Just a number of people all working together, each taking responsibility for a 
function," Vollmer said. "The board was organized into committees, each 
responsible for a function of the organization, and everybody did his bit. In 
that respect, it was a model organization for a nonprofit organization." 
</P>
<P>
Professionalism has had its effects, though: Under Vollmer, the society's 
budget has risen from $750,000 to the current $2.3 million, and subscriptions 
have just about doubled, from 3,300 to 6,500. 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't all been smooth sailing, though. Like many local organizations, the 
society saw some drop-off in subscribers after an initial surge of buyers who 
were interested in seeing the Center for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Vollmer's biggest disappointment so far, he said, has been his failure to bring 
back the New World Festival, a series of concerts by conductor Thomas and his 
Miami-based New World Symphony, which the society co-sponsored with the Center 
and UCI last summer. 
</P>
<P>
He sees his future mission clearly. 
</P>
<P>
"We have got to find a new audience," Vollmer said. "We can't exist on the 
subscriber core that we've carried all these years. And we know we are not 
beginning to reach the numbers of people who are out there and have probably 
not been to (Segerstrom) hall for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
Vollmer hopes to woo new audiences by offering such stellar attractions as the 
London Symphony and the Philadelphia Orchestra -- both are on this season's 
roster -- and by offering subscribers four series, which include recitals and 
chamber music programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking for that new infusion. . . . I think the expansion of the 
society's programs outside of orchestras -- going into recitals and chamber 
music -- is a healthy step for its growth, and for the variety and the added 
musical experience we're making available for Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Philharmonic Society will present three programs this week 
at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, in Costa 
Mesa. Michael Tilson Thomas will conduct the London Philharmonic in works by 
Berlioz, Stravinsky and Oliver Knussen Monday at 8 p.m. Tickets: $12 and $40. 
Sir Colin Davis will lead the Bavarian Symphony of Munich in music by Beethoven 
and Brahms on Wednesday at 8 p.m. Tickets: $10-$30. Zubin Mehta will conduct 
the Israel Philharmonic in a program of Brahms, Schoenberg and Mark Kopytman 
Saturday at 8 p.m. Sold out. Information: (714) 642-8232.

CENSUS BUREAU ACTS TO ENSURE CORRECT COUNT FOR SANTA ANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA NEWMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As part of an effort to get a better count of a sprawling immigrant and 
minority population that Santa Ana city officials say has been under counted in 
the past, the U.S. Census Bureau is opening a district office in Santa Ana on 
April 1 to gear up for the 1990 Census. 
</P>
<P>
The office will be the first of four to be opened in Orange County that will 
eventually employ about 800 workers who will conduct the mammoth counting task 
next spring, according to Mike Weiler, assistant regional manager for 
operations in the Census Bureau's regional office in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
The opening of the Santa Ana office marks a partnership between city and 
federal officials, one they hope will ensure that people of every cultural and 
racial background are included in the count, a concern especially critical in 
Santa Ana, whose minority population has exploded in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana officials have grumbled for almost 10 years that the city lost out on 
all sorts of federal and state funds because a large segment of its population 
went uncounted. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have said they believe the tabulation for Santa Ana was off by 
about 50,000 people in the last Census, partially because many among the city's 
immigrants and Latinos -- native and immigrant, including illegal migrants -- 
were suspicious of the process or did not understand the significance of their 
participation, said Santa Ana City Councilman Miguel A. Pulido said. 
</P>
<P>
"You might say, 'So what? What difference does it make if you under count?' The 
answer is money," Pulido said. "If you don't have an accurate count, you have 
to service people that don't exist on paper." 
</P>
<P>
If the city's population is miscounted in the same proportion as last time, 
Pulido said, the loss in revenue could be huge, as much as $5 million a year by 
some city estimates. 
</P>
<P>
"That means $150 to $200 per person per year for the decade of the '90s -- 
that's what's at stake," he said. "That's a lot of money for us." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the City Council announced formation of a Better Count Committee 
which will work with the U.S. Census Bureau to help familiarize the public with 
the benefits of cooperating with Census workers. 
</P>
<P>
Officials are predicting that with this new effort, the 1990 Census will 
present a much different picture of the county's population than that of 10 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"This whole Orange County area -- and of course Santa Ana -- has been so 
impacted with the growing Asian community, with the immigrants from Central and 
South America, as well as the Mexican immigrants who have been here for some 
time," said Martha Gallegos, who was hired in November as the city's outreach 
supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
"There's just been a tremendous growth in the last 10 years," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Local and federal officials say the experience of the last two federal Census 
counts has shown them that identifying the groups that don't participate in the 
count is not enough. The new challenge is to hire Census workers who are from 
those groups that were under counted, in order to build trust among those 
residents, and to seek out those groups on their own turf. 
</P>
<P>
The city, for example, plans to send representatives to community organizations 
and agencies to spread the word to clients, to such places as centers where 
mothers go for Women, Infant and Children social services, well-baby programs 
for low-income mothers and adult education classes that teach English to 
immigrants applying for legal status. 
</P>
<P>
Also, they will work with elementary and junior high schools to familiarize 
children with the Census material. 
</P>
<P>
"We're focusing on that level because many parents do not read, even in their 
own language," Gallegos said. "Children are often used to acting as 
interpreters for their parents to fill out forms, and we're hoping that by 
showing the children the forms, telling them what the questions are, how the 
information will be used, and really stress the confidentiality of it, when the 
parents receive the forms in the mail, the children will say, 'Oh yes, we had 
this in school, we heard about this.' " 
</P>
<P>
As Census Day -- April 1, 1990 -- approaches, the city plans to hold a carnival 
or other type of entertainment event to mark the day and help families "to 
participate in the Census in a relaxed atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
There also are plans to ask churches to mention the Census in their sermons, 
and for grocery stores to participate by announcing the approach of the Census 
on their grocery bags. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegos said she eventually will have a staff of five people, including 
Asians. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that maybe the Asian population may have been under counted, but 
mostly it was the Hispanics in Santa Ana," she said. "One of the biggest 
reasons is that there is a large population that is here illegally and, of 
course, may not want to give information, and may not understand it. Or they 
have fears, fears that maybe the INS is going to see this information . . . or 
maybe that they have three families living in a single dwelling." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana is the first city in California this year to hire an outreach worker 
to coordinate the Census task with federal officials, Gallegos said. And 
because of its high immigrant and ethnic population, Santa Ana has been 
targeted as one of 50 cities across the nation that the bureau will be working 
with closely. 
</P>
<P>
Weiler said the opening of the Santa Ana office will culminate months of work 
by federal and city officials to ensure a better count through cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, for example, John Reeder Jr., a representative of the U.S. 
Department of Commerce, came to make a presentation on the Census at an event 
sponsored by the city and Voces Unidas, a Latino civic organization. 
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau's seven other Southland offices are in Long Beach, Panorama 
City, Ventura, Pasadena, San Diego, Compton and Riverside. Weiler said the 
10-county Southern California region eventually will have 30 district offices, 
but most of those will not open until later this year. 
</P>
<P>
A management team for the Santa Ana office has already been hired and went 
through training last week, Weiler said. Now they will concentrate on hiring 
the 140 people who will begin the work of verifying computerized mail lists 
that will be used for the Census. He said he wants to get the word out that 
there are jobs to be had and that the bureau is interested in hiring people of 
all races and backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
"The vast majority of the people we hire are from the community," he said. 
"That does two things: it gives us people knowledgeable about the community. 
People feel more comfortable working in their own community. And from a cost 
standpoint, they're not spending a lot of time driving to work or finding their 
way around. 
</P>
<P>
"It also gives us a work force that is representative of the people we are 
going to count," Weiler said. "For us to do a good job, our work force must be 
representative of the people we are counting."

DRIVER KILLS BOY IN ALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 7-year-old boy died after he was struck by a speeding hit-and-run driver 
Saturday in an alley off Jeffrey Drive in an apartment complex near the 
Disneyland Hotel, Anaheim police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police were searching late Saturday for a cream-colored sedan with a damaged 
left front fender. Witnesses told police the driver never stopped after the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hit Garage Doors 
</P>
<P>
The car entered the alley near the 1600 block of Jeffrey Drive at a high rate 
of speed and hit several garage doors before striking Victor Martinez Magana of 
Anaheim. Magana was taken to Western Medical Center-Anaheim where he died an 
hour later of massive head and chest injuries, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police were not sure what the boy was doing in the alley. 
</P>
<P>
Officers said witnesses saw the car but none of them saw the vehicle strike the 
child. Officials were not sure where the boy was standing when he was hit. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Police Sgt. Fred Roush said the child lived in the area of the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
Several hours earlier, Anaheim police reported that a father accidently ran 
over his 2-year-old child in the area of Bywood Avenue. The child was rushed to 
Anaheim Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
A hospital spokesperson reported Saturday night that the child was in stable 
condition with foot injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the accident and the names of the child and father were not 
available, police said.

RACE KARTS GO BIG TIME IN SMALL WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA NEWMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a backdrop of palm trees and crashing surf, dozens of tiny but powerful 
race karts roared around a Huntington Beach parking lot Saturday, sounding like 
a platoon of lawn mowers. 
</P>
<P>
Surfers and sunbathers watched as would-be Mario Andrettis, stuffed into the 
low-slung, high-tech karts, 'participated in the first "3 Day Blinds Sprint 
Kart Grand Prix," which enthusiasts hope becomes an annual event in Huntington 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The event will benefit the Boys' and Girls' Club of Huntington Valley, 
according to event director Jim Kinder, who founded the Championship Kart 
Racing Assn. 2 years ago. Drivers were charged entry fees, beginning at $25 for 
amateurs. 
</P>
<P>
Kart racing is no longer a kids' game, and they don't call them Go-Karts 
anymore. Racing karts have evolved into a high-speed weekend sport with drivers 
reaching speeds of up to 150 m.p.h. In this race at Huntington Beach, however, 
70 to 80 m.p.h. was the standard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Karts Grow Up 
</P>
<P>
Kart racing "used to be just on supermarket parking lots," Kinder said. "Now 
they've grown to half the scale of Indy cars." And at this event, there was a 
$2,000 purse for a professionals' race, although most of the races were for 
amateurs. 
</P>
<P>
Street kart races, now held on a national circuit, aren't held anywhere else in 
the county, Kinder said, because cities tend to frown on them. 
</P>
<P>
"The city of Huntington Beach was the most incredibly cooperative city," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The karts appear tiny, no more than than 26 inches high, almost too small for a 
grown man. But as the race is about to begin, drivers hunker over, many dressed 
in black leather, or bright jumpsuits made of lightweight nylon, just like real 
car racers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a frustrated race car driver that can't go into big cars," said Newport 
Beach resident Andy Uphoff, 37. "Money is the reason. It's a lot less expensive 
to do this kind of racing." 
</P>
<P>
Uphoff said he participates in about four kart races a month, and estimated he 
spends about $400 a month on his obsession. 
</P>
<P>
At Saturday's race, there was at least one professional race car driver. 
</P>
<P>
Jerril Rice, who won the Detroit Grand Prix in 1982 and finished third in the 
Long Beach Grand Prix in 1983, got off to a slow start when his kart wouldn't 
start right away, but he still won his first race at the Huntington Beach 
event. 
</P>
<P>
"He just does this to stay in shape," said Wayne Levitz, who worked with Rice's 
pit crew. "He's the best driver you'll ever see in a kart. This guy's awesome." 
</P>
<P>
The karts have no starters, so a member of the pit crew has to start the kart 
as the race is about to begin. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent Nowak, 11, of Santa Ana was Uphoff's pit crew. With greasy hands, Nowak 
held the start-up kit, powered by a small battery, and readied Uphoff's kart. 
</P>
<P>
Nowak has spent every weekend for the last month crewing for the kart race shop 
in Santa Ana that sponsors Uphoff, so he can pay off what he owes on his own 
race kart. He gets $5 a day for his labor, he said, adding, "I only have $50 
more to work off." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it'll mean more to him if he's earning it," said his father, Gary 
Nowak. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Good Sport' 
</P>
<P>
"What I figure is this is a good sport," he said. "The people here are honest, 
they all help each other out and only compete on the track. His mother would 
rather have him do this than play football. It's a lot safer." 
</P>
<P>
Drivers all wore helmets, and bales of hay lined the course. Although several 
drivers crashed into the hay, no one was injured. City officials did not allow 
drinking in the parking lot where the event was held, and by late afternoon, 
Huntington Beach police said there were no reports of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Although kart racing is not just for kids anymore, youths as young as 12 will 
compete today in their category. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, the scene at Saturday's kart race resembled a day at the car 
races. For example, there were plenty of women cheering on the drivers from the 
sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Stacy Saver, carrying a black poodle, watched Saturday as her husband, Bruce, 
raced around the track. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, I'm just so excited," she said, a timer in one hand. "He just loves 
racing."

LAW, SERVICE TAKE BACK SEAT IN 'BANDIT' LIMO FIRMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was one of those glittering entertainment-industry evenings. A fleet of 
sleek stretch limousines fanned out around town, scooping up Cher, Bobby 
McFerrin, kitsch horror queen Elvira and others to fetch them to the 1988 MTV 
Video Music Awards show last September. 
</P>
<P>
Reclining in the plush splendor of their chauffeur-driven coaches, the stars 
were unaware that the limousine company hired for the occasion was a renegade 
firm operating outside the law -- although one of the celebrities did complain 
after arriving at Universal Amphitheatre that her driver had made sexual 
overtures. 
</P>
<P>
The rich and famous, as well as the couple down the street, have been 
victimized by price-slashing "bandit" limousine companies. Legitimate operators 
say the bandits are driving them out of business, and that state regulators are 
failing to control them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so easy for them to undercut us," said Wilma Stevens, general manager of 
Anaheim-based Cameo Limousine Inc., which runs a of fleet of 13 cars and two 
vans. "But they are haphazard in every way. They don't maintain their cars, 
they don't keep their operations safe. I tell people it doesn't matter who you 
go to, just make sure that the company is licensed and has a good reputation in 
the business." 
</P>
<P>
Operating potentially unsafe vehicles without proper licenses and insurance, 
the renegades have been involved in hit-and-run auto accidents and 
prostitution. Some have offered "prom night specials" of drugs to high school 
students. Studies in Sacramento and Los Angeles have shown that more than half 
of the advertisers in the local Yellow Pages are bandit companies, often 
operating on a shoestring out of storefronts or private homes. 
</P>
<P>
The Public Utilities Commission, which regulates the industry, has found 
problems with renegade operators in Orange County, Sacramento, Modesto, San 
Diego and Palm Springs. Los Angeles County, with its affluent neighborhoods in 
Beverly Hills and in the San Fernando Valley, "is the most serious of all," 
said Larry McNeely, a PUC enforcement official. 
</P>
<P>
With its equally affluent clientele, Orange County also represents a lucrative 
market for limousine companies and a target for illegal operators, said John 
Morgan, an investigator in the PUC's Santa Ana office. 
</P>
<P>
While there are about 150 to 200 licensed limousine, bus and van carriers in 
Orange County, there may be just as many operating illegally, Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
State law requires limousine operators to have at least $750,000 in public 
liability insurance on each car and to obtain an operating license from the 
PUC, which takes 1% of the gross revenue as a fee. Experts in the field say 
these bills can add up to more than $20,000 a year for the average mom-and-pop 
fleet of three limousines. 
</P>
<P>
Avoiding the insurance and PUC fees allows the bandits to undercut legitimate 
operators by $10 an hour or more, according to Alan Shanedling, vice president 
of the Limousine Owners Assn. of California, based in Lawndale. That has put 
pressure on the legitimate side of the industry, forcing some limousine 
companies to become bandits themselves, according to the PUC's McNeely. "It's 
almost a cannibalistic" situation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some established operators say the PUC must shoulder some of the blame for the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
"The PUC takes our money and in return they are supposed to keep us from being 
harassed by local municipalities and to keep illegals off the street. But they 
don't have the manpower to do it," said Harold Berkman, president and owner of 
Music Express Inc., a respected limousine operator in Southern California 
specializing in the celebrity trade. 
</P>
<P>
According to investigators and industry experts, the problems with bandits are 
an unwanted side effect of the Gold Rush-like boom the limousine industry has 
gone through in recent years. After the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, when some 
operators offered their cars for $1,500 a day, interest blossomed in the 
business as an investment. 
</P>
<P>
"For a couple of years, it was at the top of everyone's list of business 
opportunities," said Scott Fletcher, editor of Limousine and Chauffeur 
magazine. "Everyone jumped into it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Creative Financing 
</P>
<P>
Creative auto financing allows small businessmen with big dreams to get into 
the driver's seat. A buyer can drive off the lot in a $50,000 vehicle with 
"almost nothing down," Shanedling said. 
</P>
<P>
McNeely estimates that there are now 2,000 licensed firms in California, up 
from about 900 5 years ago, adding that "there has been tremendous growth in 
the bandit side of it." 
</P>
<P>
The PUC said passengers have been injured in accidents involving bandit 
companies. The agency is investigating two recent accidents in the Los Angeles 
area. In one, an Orange County bandit service carrying two passengers hit a 
parked car, then sped off. A wheel came off another limousine operated by the 
same company, and the limousine struck a car. 
</P>
<P>
PUC officials say bandit limousine companies have served as fronts for illegal 
activities. "We're fully aware they are involved in narcotics and 
prostitution," said McNeely. "During prom season, we heard more than once that 
companies would take you to the prom and you would get five lines of coke." 
</P>
<P>
A Monterey County drug dealer used his unlicensed limousine service to deliver 
cocaine, authorities said. After penetrating the operation, they discovered 
well-maintained "trip sheets" showing the destination of the drug shipments. 
</P>
<P>
sh Slow to Get Tough 
</P>
<P>
Critics in the industry say the PUC has been slow to get tough on the 
lawbreakers. McNeely agrees that the criticism "probably is correct. Several 
cases went by the wayside" in the past because of a shortage of enforcement 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan, for example, is the only investigator assigned to Orange County and his 
territory previously included San Bernardino County as well. His current 
caseload includes about 50 suspected bandit operations. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time you get around to investigating a company they will be gone," he 
said. "I would estimate that when the latest Yellow Pages come out, 25% of 
those companies listed are no longer in business. Within a year, probably 50 to 
60% of companies go out of business." 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1987, however, the California Legislature authorized the creation of 
the Passenger Compliance Unit in the PUC, with six new enforcement positions, 
to deal with the problem. McNeel, a former state Department of Justice 
official, was brought in to work more closely with local prosecutors around the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
The new approach has yielded results. At least 17 unlawful-business-practice 
suits have been filed against bandits. Judges have issued restraining orders to 
stop operations in some of the cases and ordered the seats removed from one 
company's limousines to make sure the vehicles stayed off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charges Pending 
</P>
<P>
In addition, criminal misdemeanor charges are pending against several companies 
in Orange County, Morgan said. He would not elaborate on the cases. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County district attorney's office is also investigating two 
companies and expects to file civil lawsuits within the next few weeks for 
operating without a license, failing to provide adequate insurance and 
performing inadequate safety equipment checks, said Gay Geiser-Sandoval, a 
deputy in the office's consumer protection branch. 
</P>
<P>
A January state auditor general's report indicated that the PUC still has its 
work cut out for it, however. The report said the agency had failed to follow 
up on nearly half of the cases against unlicensed operators. Further, seven of 
the bandits involved in those cases were still doing business in December. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen this, where companies are blatantly operating in violation of 
the law," said McNeely. "They continue operating even when they know we're 
watching them, thumbing their noses at the investigating agency." 
</P>
<P>
In one of the Los Angeles bandit cases, the operator of JJ&amp;T Limousines was 
accused of leaving high school students stranded on graduation night and of 
failing to return deposits. Sir Michael's Limousines Ltd., which has since 
obtained a license, was spotted at the Academy Awards show last year carrying a 
Los Angeles city councilman, according to a PUC investigator. Twenty-one other 
illegal operators carried clients attending the same Academy Awards show. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Didn't Check Company 
</P>
<P>
Another Los Angeles suit was filed against Elegant Limousines Inc., which 
provided limousine service at the MTV awards show. Karen Sortito, an account 
director for the western division of MTV Networks, said MTV paid Elegant 
$17,737 and promoted the limousine company in millions of American homes with a 
free, on-air advertisement. 
</P>
<P>
Although there were no accidents, Sortito said a celebrity complained "that one 
of the drivers was sexually suggestive to her." Sortito said she did not check 
the status of the company because "they were referred to me" by a co-worker. 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't the only problem involving Elegant. When the future Margery Pinedo 
met a limousine in Van Nuys that was to take her to a San Gabriel church for 
her wedding last Sept. 3, she found a red-faced driver without a tie who 
proceeded to lose his way, she said in an interview. Worse, the air-conditioner 
was out of order. With the temperature soaring, the interior got so hot that 
Pinedo's 3-year-old niece suffered a bloody nose. Pinedo's $900 wedding dress 
wilted. Refused a refund and a replacement car, the newlyweds finally 
discharged the limousine at the church, abandoning plans to ride to the 
reception in luxury, according to Pinedo. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was above $200 for 45 minutes, Pinedo said. "We tried not to let it 
spoil the whole day." 
</P>
<P>
Legitimate companies, who say the bandits are giving them a black eye, are 
applauding the stepped-up enforcement efforts of the PUC. "Even though only a 
few cases have been prosecuted, the word does spread and cleans up quite a few 
others," said Glenn Barrons, president of the Limousine Owners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Move by Legitimate Firms 
</P>
<P>
And many industry observers say there has also been a move by legitimate owners 
to put bandit companies out of business. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure there are many still operating out there, bit it's not so apparent 
any longer," said Pat Erskine, owner of the Limousine Information Center of 
Orange County, a ground transportation travel agency. "If (legitimate 
companies) hear of someone out there, they contact the PUC and they follow up 
on it." 
</P>
<P>
While operators are supposed to list their PUC permit numbers in their 
advertisements, not all do. Also, bandits have been using phony numbers for 
several years. A simple rule of thumb for a person shopping for a limousine is 
to look at the price, industry experts say. If the company advertises a rate 
much lower than others, it might be wise to be suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
"Cheap is cheap," said Berkman, of Music Express. "You can't give cheap and be 
legal."

NO SURPRISE: TITANS NAME SNEED COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton, which ended its basketball season Friday night with a loss 
to Nevada Las Vegas, put the finishing touch on the year Saturday by naming 
John Sneed as its basketball coach. He was given a three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this job is a little bit easier to keep than it was to get," Sneed 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sneed, who was named acting coach when George McQuarn resigned Nov. 3, guided 
the Titans to a 16-13 season that included an upset of UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
But as Sneed guided the team through the final weeks of the season, Fullerton 
interviewed two other coaches, fulfilling an announced commitment to an open 
search. Texas San Antonio Coach Ken Burmeister and UCLA assistant Paul 
Landreaux withdrew their applications after being interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
"I aggressively recruited the best possible applicants," Athletic Director Ed 
Carroll said. "(Sneed) has met all comers. It was not an inside job. He has met 
the best and come out on top. . . . It became clear that John was the best 
choice. Certainly his ability to coach, the Xs and Os, you've seen that game 
after game. His ability to pull the players together under adverse situations 
is a real tribute to his ability as a head coach." 
</P>
<P>
With the process complete, Sneed said he had no complaint with the search. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it doesn't matter how long it takes you to run a race as long as you 
finish first," Sneed said. "I don't have a problem with the process. . . . I'd 
rather be first and take a lot of time in the race than run a real quick race 
and finish second. . . . The goal I've had for a number of years is to be a 
Division I head coach. Sometimes you don't get that opportunity, because it's 
not like a player. See, a player can walk on to show his ability. A coach never 
has an opportunity to walk on and show his ability." 
</P>
<P>
Although Sneed guided the Titans into a fourth-place tie in the Big West 
Conference despite being picked to finish ninth, his handicap in seeking the 
job was considered to be the team's poor graduation rate during his eight years 
as an assistant to McQuarn. 
</P>
<P>
"The effort John has made already on academics is very encouraging," Carroll 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot of priorities, and one undoubtedly is to improve the academic 
situation at the university," Sneed said. "We have been working very hard at 
that, to bring about a change in attitude in our athletes and to raise our 
graduation rate. We're not going to complete that in a few months. That will be 
over a longer period of time." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton finished the season with 16 victories, despite having a team with no 
returning starters from the previous season when the Titans were 12-17. 
</P>
<P>
After the season-ending loss Friday, Fullerton is considered to have an outside 
shot at a bid to the National Invitation Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we would have still been on the bubble if we'd gotten our 17th win," 
Sneed said. "But if there is a bid, we'll take it." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton will have four starters back next season. 
</P>
<P>
But Sneed's immediate priority is recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a little bit behind here (in recruiting), but we've been behind all year 
and several times we've come out on top," Sneed said. 
</P>
<P>
He also will hire a second assistant. He announced Saturday that assistant 
Donny Daniels will stay on. 
</P>
<P>
"That -- along with business cards -- is a priority," Sneed said.

Steve Gill's first-inning home run helped Cypress College put Fullerton in a 
hole and the Chargers went on to a 12-4 victory in an Orange Empire Conference 
baseball game Saturday at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Mitch Kaylor opened the game with a single, Jason Friedman walked and Gill hit 
a hanging breaking pitch well over the right-field fence. The home run was 
Gill's eighth of the season, tops among community college players in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress starter Rich Lodding struggled enough to keep Fullerton in the game 
until Cypress (16-6 overall and 4-2 in conference play) scored six runs in the 
sixth to take a 12-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Lodding hit three consecutive hitters with one out in the third and appeared to 
hit a fourth, but the base umpire ruled the ball went off John Mele's bat. Mele 
hit a sacrifice fly and Lodding then worked out of the inning with a 4-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Lodding (5-2) worked six innings for the victory. Fullerton starter Norm Hunter 
(1-2) lasted two-plus innings to take the loss. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress opened the sixth with six consecutive hits and sent 11 batters to the 
plate in scoring six runs. Mike Neal, Jim Berry and Bobby Thome had RBI 
singles, Kaylor walked with the bases loaded and Friedman had a sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman had a third-inning single to extend his hitting streak to 13 games. 
John Connolly had two hits and two RBIs for Fullerton (7-10, 2-4). 
</P>
<P>
In other Orange Empire Conference games: 
</P>
<P>
Golden West 10, Riverside 4 -- Golden West (11-5, 5-1) scored five runs in the 
first and four in the ninth at Riverside. Ken Lynch had pair of doubles and 
three RBIs and Steve McKowen, Mark Magrann, Craig Paquette and Frank Herman had 
two hits each for Golden West. Dave Turner (3-0) worked six-plus innings for 
the victory. 
</P>
<P>

GRAHAM QUITS TROY JOB TO COACH AT DON LUGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ed Graham, varsity basketball coach at Troy High School, has resigned his 
position effective April 7 to become an assistant basketball coach at Don Lugo 
High in Chino Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Graham, 38, compiled a 34-33 record at Troy in three seasons, leading the 
Warriors to two Southern Section playoff berths. He also was an assistant track 
coach and taught English. 
</P>
<P>
Before coming to Troy, Graham was basketball coach at Orange High School. 
</P>
<P>
"I moved to Chino Hills five months ago and was spending too much time on the 
freeway and not enough time with my family," Graham said. "I thought the 
commute would be no problem, but I was wrong."

DIVISION II GIRLS;

<P>
EASTERLY SHRUGS OFF SLOW START, LEADS KATELLA'S FAST FINISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With 2 minutes 11 seconds left in the third quarter of the Southern California 
Regional Division II girls' championship game Saturday, Joni Easterly was stuck 
in a spot she least wanted to be. She was sitting on the bench with four fouls. 
</P>
<P>
She watched and worried, shouting encouragement to her Katella High School 
teammates. She shot anxious glances at the Sports Arena scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
Katella trailed Vista and there was nothing Easterly, the Knights' leading 
scorer, could do about it. 
</P>
<P>
Easterly got back into the game with 7:15 left to play, but not before asking 
Coach Barb Bausch "about five times" to go back in. 
</P>
<P>
When she returned, Easterly led Katella to a 56-50 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still in shock," Bausch said. "I don't know how we did it." 
</P>
<P>
Katella (29-3) advances to the state Division II championship game against 
Sacramento Grant next Saturday in Oakland. Vista finished its season 28-4. 
</P>
<P>
Easterly, a 5-foot-11 forward who has signed a letter of intent to play at USC 
next season, had a game-high 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
Most important for Katella, she had 12 of the Knights' 16 points in the fourth 
quarter to lead them back from a five-point deficit with 6:50 left. 
</P>
<P>
First, though, she had to suffer through an agonizing first half and through 
the 3 minutes on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Easterly's first two shots were blocked by Chris Enger, Vista's 6-4 center. She 
made only three of 16 shots from the field and had eight points in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Katella still managed to lead, 28-22, at the half, largely because of the 
accurate shooting of point guard Angie Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez had 12 points at the half and finished with 19. She made nine of 16 shots 
from the field and came up with numerous loose balls in the Knights' scrappy 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always someone who takes up the slack," Bausch said. "That's why it's 
so hard to play us. Even I never know who's going to do it." 
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, Easterly started to find her shooting touch, but she got 
into foul trouble not long after and Vista rallied and took the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Enger, who had 20 points, led the comeback, scoring six consecutive points for 
Vista late in the third quarter. Vista led, 44-41, at the end of the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
When Kelli Schott, who had 12 points, made a jumper, Vista's lead was 46-41. 
</P>
<P>
But Easterly returned shortly thereafter and took control of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"She's the type of player who never gives up," Bausch said. "She'll keep 
shooting. She knows it'll fall sooner or later." 
</P>
<P>
Easterly kept shooting and made five of seven shots from the field in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
"It took awhile, but my confidence came back," Easterly said. 
</P>
<P>
A basket and a free throw by Wendy Carlson with 5:13 left got Katella even with 
Vista, 48-48. 
</P>
<P>
Two free throws by Easterly with 5:05 left put Katella ahead for good, 50-48. 
She added a short jumper, then drove around Enger, who also had picked up her 
fourth foul, for another basket. 
</P>
<P>
Easterly, who had a game-high 13 rebounds, added two free throws with 5 seconds 
left to seal the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Vista seemed to run out of gas late in the game. And even Enger, who also had 
12 rebounds and eight blocks, could do little to rally the Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
They were scoreless in the last 3 minutes and had just two points in the final 
5:05. 
</P>
<P>
"Once we started falling behind, we seemed to get more fatigued," Vista Coach 
Joe DeMaria said.

DEVELOPERS PLAN TO TRANFORM COASTLINE-AND IMAGE OF ORANGE COUNTY TOURISM-WITH 
NEARLY 5,000 RESORT HOTEL ROOMS IN THE NEXT 4 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SCHINE, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Not too long ago, vacationing in Orange County meant packing the kids into the 
station wagon for a trip to Disneyland, the beach and maybe a couple of nights 
in a local motel. 
</P>
<P>
Plenty of young families still make that legendary pilgrimage. But others with 
a taste for the high life -- and the cash to indulge it -- are discovering that 
Orange County tourism has gone upscale. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, when the Ritz-Carlton hotel opened on a stretch of oceanfront property 
that is now part of of Dana Point, some hotel experts predicted that the 
luxurious 391-room hotel would never make money. For one thing, it seemed out 
of character with Southern California. (At first, the hotel required men to 
wear jackets after sunset; it still requires jackets and ties in the dining 
room.) 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Ritz-Carlton says it is operating at a profit, and by all accounts, 
it is a success. It has since been joined by the 350-room Dana Point Resort, 
which is more modest than the Ritz-Carlton but nevertheless an upscale 
establishment on a bluff overlooking Dana Point Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Now other developers, eager to tap the market for well-heeled travelers, have 
cleared a variety of environmental hurdles and are planning three giant 
developments that will forever change stretches of the Orange County coastline. 
</P>
<P>
Within the next 4 years, nearly 5,000 additional resort hotel rooms will be 
built along the coast from Huntington Beach to Dana Point. The construction 
promises to transform the coastline into an area that the tourism industry, 
with characteristic boosterism, claims will one day be known around the world 
as the Orange Coast Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
In April, construction is scheduled to begin on a four-hotel, 1,450-room 
development on 20 acres along Pacific Coast Highway in Huntington Beach called 
the Waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
In May, construction will begin on the Monarch Beach Resort, a $300-million, 
1,126-room extravaganza on one of the last untouched strips of land along Coast 
Highway, just north of the Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point. The ocean-bluff project 
is a joint venture of Stein-Brief Inc. and the Hemmeter Corp., famous for its 
elaborate Hawaiian resorts. They are spending nearly $20 million on landscaping 
alone for the development. 
</P>
<P>
And by 1990, the Irvine Co. plans to begin construction on the first of three 
hotels with a total of 2,150 rooms and two 18-hole golf courses on one of the 
choicest pieces of real estate in Southern California, a 3-mile strip of 
rolling hills between Laguna Beach and Corona del Mar called the Irvine Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a general slump in the Orange County hotel market, developers are 
confident that there will be enough tourists to back up this unprecedented 
building spree. Some assert that demand for these huge seaside resorts has gone 
unmet for years. Others say that even if adequate demand does not yet exist, it 
can be created with savvy marketing. 
</P>
<P>
"Resort development is hot across the country. People are taking more 
vacations. Travel is up and more foreigners are coming here," said James Burba 
of Pannell Kerr Forster, a consulting firm serving the hotel industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The Ritz opened everyone's mind to the idea that here is a real resort area," 
said Sherrie Laveroni, general manager of the Dana Point Resort. 
</P>
<P>
The Ritz-Carlton, jointly owned by Prudential Insurance Co. of America and 
Atlanta-based W. B. Properties Inc., billed itself as the first major resort 
built along the Southern California coast in nearly 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Besides its seaside locale, the $100-million project boasts tennis courts, 
swimming pools, meticulous service and a collection of 18th-Century art on its 
walls. The hotel has won five stars -- the highest award -- from both the Mobil 
Travel Guide and the American Automobile Assn., two of the more prestigious 
honors in the U.S. travel industry. 
</P>
<P>
Its look and feel have been compared to opulent turn-of-the-century seaside 
resorts. But its rates are definitely modern, with rooms starting at $185 a 
night and going up to $2,000 for a five-bedroom suite with a baby grand piano. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Developments Mushrooming 
</P>
<P>
After a rocky first year marked by a protracted battle with creditors, which 
was eventually settled, the Ritz-Carlton became profitable by 1986. According 
to general manager Henry E. Schielein, the hotel's occupancy rate in 1988 was 
well above the Orange County average of 69%, and its revenue was between $45 
million and $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
Room rates at the Dana Point Resort range from $160 to $1,050 per night, 
Laveroni said. The hotel, owned by Ed and Tom Slatkin (sons of Burton Slatkin, 
the former owner of Beverly Hills Hotel), claimed a 50% occupancy rate in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Ritz-Carlton opened in 1984, coastal hotel development has progressed 
at a good clip from Santa Barbara to San Diego, according to numbers recently 
compiled by Laventhol &amp; Horwath, the accounting and consulting firm. In 
1985, there were only 13 "upscale water-oriented hotels" along the Southern 
California coast, with 4,500 rooms. By 1988, there were 21 such hotels with 
7,500 rooms. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, several new seaside resorts are under consideration 
along the Palos Verdes coastline, including another Ritz-Carlton hotel about 
two miles south of the former Marineland aquatic park site. In northern San 
Diego County, developers expect to complete 1,500 new rooms in 1989 from Del 
Mar to Oceanside, according to the San Diego Convention and Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
But local developers assert that the strip of resorts along the Orange County 
coast will be more distinctive, more elaborate and more luxurious than the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Their intention is to turn the area into a tourist destination in itself, not 
just a place to recuperate from day trips to Disneyland, Sea World or Knott's 
Berry Farm. These resorts don't plan to compete with nearby inland lodges or 
with other seaside hotels but with resorts in Hawaii, Palm Springs, Scottsdale, 
Ariz., and, yes, even Monte Carlo. 
</P>
<P>
Can Orange County -- once considered a byword for provincialism in some circles 
-- draw the same well-heeled travelers who patronize resorts such as Palm 
Springs? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aura of Sophistication 
</P>
<P>
Industry experts say the jury's still out. A lot depends on whether the new 
hotels scheduled for construction live up to their billing and are snazzy 
enough to complement the Ritz-Carlton. 
</P>
<P>
According to general manager Schielein, the Ritz-Carlton's reputation is 
drawing a steady stream of vacationers from Europe and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
But while the upper-crust, international flavor of the Ritz-Carlton has 
provided an aura of sophistication to the Orange County resort concept, its 
potential primarily reflects economic and demographic growth within the greater 
Los Angeles area, industry experts said. 
</P>
<P>
Schielein, in fact, acknowledged that virtually all of the Ritz-Carlton's 
weekend guests are Californians. Of those who sign on for longer stays, most 
hail from California or other western states. 
</P>
<P>
"The Orange County coast's greatest asset is that it is adjacent to a nearly 
14-million-person market in Southern California, and the Northern California 
market is certainly available to it," said Sam L. Van Landingham, a partner 
with Portman Properties, an Atlanta development firm that has built posh hotels 
from New York to San Francisco and the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly the success of the Ritz-Carlton is supported primarily by Southern 
California. And a larger critical mass of hotels along the Irvine Coast and 
south county coast can be successful," said Van Landingham, a former Irvine Co. 
executive who was in charge of the company's hotel development. 
</P>
<P>
"How successful it will be on an international or national basis is harder to 
determine," Landingham said. "It doesn't have a year-round climate, like 
Hawaii, so it's not a true year-round ocean resort." 
</P>
<P>
One thing working in its favor is that the coastal resort market appears to be 
far from saturated. 
</P>
<P>
"For the inland hotels, there has been an oversupply that has come into the 
market. But the coastal resorts are quite different animals," said Donald 
Engfer, head of hotel development for the Irvine Co. "There is an established 
pattern of coastal tourism in California, but there has been comparatively 
little development over the years." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Receptive 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, the creation of the California Coastal Commission put a halt to most 
large seaside hotel developments of any kind. In its early years, the 
commission was guided by a strict interpretation of its mandate to manage 
coastal resources that blocked most development. But since Gov. George 
Deukmejian took office in 1983, the 12-member board has become more receptive 
to developers. 
</P>
<P>
Hotels also seem to be one of the paths of least resistance for developers 
faced with hostile environmentalists. A resort often leaves much more open 
space and has less impact on the environment than dense clusters of housing. 
</P>
<P>
"The coastal (conservation) act does favor the development of tourist 
facilities, particularly when it is done in a such a way that it increases 
access to the coast for both paying and non-paying visitors," said Jack 
Liebster, a spokesman for the commission. "Developers have gotten better at 
this." 
</P>
<P>
The Ritz-Carlton, which built a public parking lot and a path down to the 
beach, is "a perfect example," Liebster said. 
</P>
<P>
And the Irvine Co. began to make changes in its plans for the Irvine Coast 10 
years ago in the face of resistance from citizens. Originally, the company 
planned to build 21,000 homes and two 10-story office towers on the parcel, 
among other things; then the Coastal Commission came along and everything 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually the Irvine Co. agreed to let environmentalists help plan a new 
development and sold land it had originally intended for houses on the ocean 
side of Coast Highway to the state for a park in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a blueprint that includes 2,600 homes and three hotels perched 
along the hills, which even environmentalists grudgingly approve. About 
three-quarters of the land will remain open. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Changes Coast Forever' 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it, developments like these are going to have an impact. They're 
going to change the whole coast forever," said Judy Rosener, assistant dean at 
the Graduate School of Management at UC Irvine and a former Coastal Commission 
member with environmentalist leanings. 
</P>
<P>
"But there's no question the development we have now is better than it would 
have been" without the time-out imposed by the commission, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the excitement over the coming resorts, industry consultants warn 
that making a luxury hotel work is a tricky proposition. 
</P>
<P>
A rough rule of thumb in the hotel industry is that a project will not pay off 
unless it can charge $1 in room rates for each $1,000 spent building a room. At 
the Ritz-Carlton, which cost about $100 million, that translates to about $250 
a night. 
</P>
<P>
While the Ritz won't divulge its average room rate, it says it falls within a 
range of $200 to $250 a night. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the average falls somewhat short of the mark, upscale hotels such as 
the Ritz-Carlton have other sources of revenue that can push the hotel into the 
black, such as food and alcohol sales and special events, including wedding 
receptions. 
</P>
<P>
"The Ritz was a calculated risk, and it paid off," said Christopher B. 
Leinberger, managing partner of Robert Charles Lesser &amp; Co., a real estate 
consulting firm based in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"But that high-end group of the hotel market is so hyperdiscretionary that you 
have to give them exactly what they want and when they want it," he said. "And 
if they don't like what you give them, they'll go back to their friends at the 
country clubs and spread the word. Then the hotel will fail." 
</P>
<P>
And there is concern that California laws requiring open public access to all 
beaches might compromise efforts by resort operators to create an exclusive 
ambiance. 
</P>
<P>
Boosters, however, counter that being on the beach really isn't as important as 
being able to see it, especially because Orange County's resorts are designed 
to be centered around golf, tennis and shopping. 
</P>
<P>
"The best situation is to have a private beach," acknowledged the 
Ritz-Carlton's Schielein. 
</P>
<P>
"But the second best is to have this beautiful (public) beach, the sunset in 
the evening and the fresh sea breeze. . . . In the summer the beaches do get 
crowded, but we are perched on a bluff 150 feet above it all."

THREE RESORTS PLANNED FOR ORANGE COUNTY'S COAST 
</P>
<P>
THE WATERFRONT 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps nothing signifies the changing image of Huntington Beach's coastline 
from a funky surfer haven to a more upscale, high-rent district better than the 
Waterfront, along the inland side of Pacific Coast Highway, between Huntington 
Street and Beach Boulevard. Construction of a 300-room hotel is scheduled to 
begin in April. Developed by Robert Mayer Corp. of Newport Beach, the project 
will include: 
</P>
<P>
Four hotels with a total of 1,450 rooms 
</P>
<P>
Residential and commercial development 
</P>
<P>
THE IRVINE COAST 
</P>
<P>
After an 18-year struggle with the California Coastal Commission and local 
community groups, the Irvine Co. won approval last year to develop the stretch 
of unspoiled hills that roll down to Pacific Coast Highway between Corona del 
Mar and Laguna Beach. Construction on the first of three hotels, a 450-room 
"spa resort," is scheduled to begin by early 1991, with a completion date set 
for early 1993. The development will include: 
</P>
<P>
Up to 2,150 hotel rooms 
</P>
<P>
2,600 houses 
</P>
<P>
Two golf courses 
</P>
<P>
MONARCH BEACH 
</P>
<P>
Construction is scheduled to begin in May on this 1,126-room resort on 209 
acres of hillside off Coast Highway in Dana Point. Stein-Brief Inc. and 
Hemmeter Corp., known for elaborate Hawaiian resorts, are co-developers. The 
resort, scheduled for completion by mid-1991, will include: 
</P>
<P>
An 850-room hotel 
</P>
<P>
A 276-room "luxury suite hotel" 
</P>
<P>
An aerial tramway to carry guests down from the hotels to Monarch Beach.

AUTO REPOSSESSION FIRMS BUSY AS MORE BUYERS FAIL TO MAKE PAYMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Repo man Kevin McGivern says business is brisker than usual at his Chicago auto 
repossession company -- one of the nation's largest -- with about twice as many 
people surrendering their cars because they can't make payments. 
</P>
<P>
The repossession rate is even more frenetic at Bruce Schneider's Allied 
Recovery Inc. in Portland, Ore., where nearly five times as many car owners are 
voluntarily handing over their keys compared to last year. 
</P>
<P>
"What's going on right now is no different than at any time when money has 
tightened up a little," McGivern said. "It's all cyclical." 
</P>
<P>
Easy credit, including longer loan terms, dating from a time when interest 
rates were lower, has spawned an increase in defaulted auto loans, say auto 
makers, repo agents and some banks. 
</P>
<P>
It's been somewhat of a boon to the repo business, which thrives by working for 
creditors to seize goods bought on borrowed money when loans aren't repaid on 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"People were attracted to the lower (interest) rates and ran out and bought on 
impulse," said Huey Mayronne, executive director of American Recovery Assn., 
trade group for the nation's auto repossessors. 
</P>
<P>
"At the same time they were buying TVs and other things on credit," Mayronne 
said. "They didn't realize what their budgets could handle. It's catching up 
with them now." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trend Noticed 
</P>
<P>
Domestic auto makers, which offered low-rate loans in 1986 and 1987 to help 
regain their share of the market from foreign competitors, have especially 
noticed this trend. 
</P>
<P>
No. 1 General Motors Corp., for instance, reports that 2% of the vehicles 
financed through its lending arm, or about 143,000 cars and trucks, were 
repossessed last year, up from 1.6% in 1987 and the highest level in 8 years. 
The rate peaked at 2.9% in 1970 but had remained below the 2% level until 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Ford Motor Co.'s repossessions and loan defaults also climbed in 1988 from the 
previous year, according to its financing unit, Ford Motor Credit Co. Although 
the company doesn't provide figures, it noted that 1988 profits fell 17% over 
the previous year partly because of credit losses. 
</P>
<P>
Banks have also been involved in the auto financing frenzy, introducing 
60-month loans about 4 years ago in reaction to rapidly rising auto prices. But 
even though they've seen a slight rise in credit losses it hasn't been nearly 
as much as experienced by the auto makers themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The overall repossession rate of banks that lend directly to buyers averaged 
0.1% of outstanding loans in 1988, up slightly from 0.10% the previous year, 
according to the American Bankers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Delinquency rates on direct bank loans averaged 1.83% in 1988, up from 1.71% 
the previous year, the bank trade group said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Competition Great 
</P>
<P>
"The competition is so great among the loan institutions that they're taking 
fringe buyers where they wouldn't take them," said repo man Myles Weiss, owner 
of Able Auto Adjusters in Los Angeles. "The bottom line is someone will take a 
chance on you." 
</P>
<P>
Ford Motor Credit Chairman William Odom conceded that credit standards had been 
lowered, particularly among first-time buyers, but he said the company has been 
tightening procedures. He said the unexpectedly high credit loss of 1988 "is 
changing things . . . in the way we evaluate and investigate loan applications 
at the lower end of the credit-worthiness scale." 
</P>
<P>
With the steady increase in interest rates lately, some industry experts are 
predicting that financial institutions will be more selective in who they lend 
money to and that many more would-be car owners will remain on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
But for now lenders must deal with the problems of the recent past. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking the adjusters have been busier than they have been before," 
Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to provide any figures at his repossession firm, but some others 
who did noted an increase, particularly among owners who voluntarily relinquish 
their cars. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider's Oregon repo company used to have one or two people surrender their 
cars every week but now he's seeing that same amount each day. "You're finding 
more '86 and '87s being surrendered," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Give-Ups 
</P>
<P>
Chicago repo man McGivern has 10 to 16 voluntary give-ups a week, twice as many 
as usual. 
</P>
<P>
"They (lenders) put out a (large) amount of paper on car loans in the last year 
and a half," McGivern said. "(But) they would not finance these cars if they 
did not know they had the alternative to repossess the car." 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, defaults occur in the later stages of long-term loans, when 
debt-burdened owners realize their vehicles are worth less than the amount 
outstanding on the loan, a condition known in the industry as being "upside 
down." 
</P>
<P>
"Not realizing what could happen to his credit rating . . . the car owner 
thinks, 'Maybe I would be better off defaulting,' " said Donald W. Grigley, 
senior vice president at Connecticut National Bank in Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Over a 2-year period the value of a new car may depreciate anywhere from 35% to 
60%, a rate which experts say has been creeping up in the last 3 to 5 years. 
The longer the loan the more time it takes to build up equity. 
</P>
<P>
Grigley gives the following example: a new subcompact costing $10,000 in 1987 
would have a book value of $4,100 today. If the owner took out a $9,000 bank 
loan over 48 months at 9% interest, he would still owe $4,902.18, or around 
$800 more than the car's value. 
</P>
<P>
The owner wouldn't gain equity until the 30th month, when the car would be 
worth $3,800, versus $3,750 left on the loan. Full equity is achieved after 4 
years, when the car is worth $2,800 and the loan is retired. 
</P>
<P>
"The longer you go (in loan period) the more problems you can have," Weiss 
said. "A 36-month loan should really be the maximum." 
</P>
<P>
After a car is repossessed, voluntarily or not, it usually is sold at auction, 
often "as is." 
</P>
<P>
But repossession won't put an end to previous owners' credit problems. They 
still remain liable for the difference between the amount of the loan and what 
the car sells for.

NEW YORK

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beware the telephone. TV ads may tease and promise adventure at the fingertips. 
But it is call now, pay later, when the monthly bill shows where late night 
loneliness and the pursuit of romance dug into the wallet. 
</P>
<P>
That once-friendly instrument, masquerading in the colors of the rainbow and 
shapes that range from computer clever to Space Age gothic, is at your service 
with services you never dreamed you would want. 
</P>
<P>
Everything from pay-as-you-talk to Santa to pay-as-you-dream about sex. 
</P>
<P>
A firm in Seattle brought down the wrath of parents with a half-hour Christmas 
show featuring Santa Claus. Children were told to hold their telephones toward 
the screen, whereupon tone-activated signals dialed up that jolly old elf so 
the kids could chat with him, while the computer logged and charged for the 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
Things have changed in the telephone world, not so much because the changes are 
needed, but because they are possible. And profitable. 
</P>
<P>
Today's telephone junkie can have intimate chats with all kinds of strangers. 
</P>
<P>
Now a whole new series of 1-900 numbers are opening up. On some you are a quiz 
show guest, answering with your push-button phone to maybe win a prize. But you 
pay for the call, perhaps $2 for openers and more if you stay on the line. 
</P>
<P>
A simple call on one adult sex line in New York City can run $20 or more, 
whether you talk or not. 
</P>
<P>
The telephone has spawned a new business that some say is eclipsing $400 
million a year and growing. An evening of letting your fingers do the walking 
can ring up a $200 phone bill in a couple of hours. 
</P>
<P>
The same comforting device that gave you grandma's warm and comforting voice 
now gives you everything from strange sex to sexy strangers, from gays in 
search of companionship to high school kids on a high. 
</P>
<P>
It offers up the stock market, the latest interest rates, advice on mortgages. 
Its recorded voices tell you what meetings there are in your community, where 
to shop for an auto loan, when to get up, how to pray, what your biorhythms 
are, when your stars are favorable, when they are not, how to get a date 
whatever your sexual or racial choice, who is going to win the Super Bowl and 
what the point spread is, where to get free money for college. 
</P>
<P>
Dial and get the latest jokes, the top horse racing picks, lottery results, a 
daily diet, skiing bargains, sports scores, government job openings, insults, 
wine choices, movie reviews, soap opera reviews, music trivia, sports trivia, 
trivial trivia. 
</P>
<P>
That's not all. 
</P>
<P>
On the gab lines you can chat with strangers, search for a date, leave your 
number for promised human adventure, dispel in seven push-button digits that 
most universal of all human conditions, loneliness. And if one is too shy, dial 
the adult lines (in New York there are more than 200 of them) and become an 
aural voyeur to kinky sex, erotic fantasy. From their lips to your ear, and 
only the telephone billing computer will know. 
</P>
<P>
It is 5:30 a.m. in New York City and CBS has sandwiched in between its 
late-night rerun and morning business shows a commercial or two showing a 
black-dressed villain and a pretty blonde a la Perils of Pauline urging viewers 
to call a certain 970 number and rescue this damsel from certain boredom. 
</P>
<P>
When the number is reached (after several tries), a woman's voice says the call 
will cost $5 unless you hang up now. Then you are assigned your personal code 
number and given another telephone number to call. After several tries again, 
you enter your code, then push another number as instructed and finally reach a 
young, breathless voice named Linda. She is apparently ready to field your 
favorite fantasy, although she volunteers nothing. 
</P>
<P>
You find that she is a 22-year-old college graduate (political science) from a 
New York state university, is thinking about joining the Peace Corps, and is 
saving money to go to Europe to visit a friend. 
</P>
<P>
You hesitate to ask, "What's a nice girl like you doing in this racket," and 
inquire instead, "Are you well-paid for this?" 
</P>
<P>
She answers no. Then someone steps in and terminates the call. Either time was 
up or the questions were going too far. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks later the television invitation to call carries a sotto voce 
addendum: "$10 a call." 
</P>
<P>
This particular operation is offered by one of a group of companies, known 
usually as Omni Phone Inc. of Seattle, although in Texas the name is HDL Inc. 
The marketing and promotion is handled by a firm called the Megaquest Group, 
based in Seattle. The companies employ about 500 people and operate in about 30 
cities domestically, plus all of Canada and in London, Rotterdam, Paris and 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
One of the satellite companies, Phonequest, was the one that engineered the 
Santa calling show. It was syndicated to 30 domestic and four foreign markets. 
When the Seattle station began getting irate calls, it quickly ran a warning to 
children with the printed words telling them to ask Mom and Dad first. Why did 
Phonequest, which has used the program for four years, rely on the electronic 
dialing technique? A spokesman said it was to prevent children from dialing the 
wrong number. 
</P>
<P>
When one of the firm's 970 numbers in New York City was dialed and reached 
after several abortive tries, a pretentiously sexy female voice answered and 
offered to be companionable. When the phone bill came in, it registered four 
calls and two additional minutes. The charge was $79.80, even though three of 
the calls never produced an answer. When the number was called back, post 
billing, this was the conversation: 
</P>
<P>
Hi, welcome to party line. 
</P>
<P>
How much does this call cost? 
</P>
<P>
You didn't hear the recording? 
</P>
<P>
There was no recording. 
</P>
<P>
$19.95. 
</P>
<P>
Goodby. 
</P>
<P>
That number also was advertised on television, with an attractive young woman 
adding under her breathless message, "$19.95 a call." It so happened that 
particular number was another Omni Phone enterprise. Betsy Superfon, known 
erroneously in the trade as "Betsy Superphone," is chief executive officer of 
the Seattle-based firm. 
</P>
<P>
She says the company offers everything from soap opera updates to joke lines, 
from dial-an-insult to group access lines. She outlined plans to go into other 
areas with information storage and retrieval via voice, a kind of telephone 
postal service, as well as interconnections between computers, and varying 
menus available on a single line to get specific data, for instance in sports, 
that the caller desires. 
</P>
<P>
There is also a proposal to acquire her firm from herself and partners Joel and 
Rebecca Eisenberg. They claim a 1987 net income of not less than $4 million. 
The would-be acquirer is a Texas firm called WurlTech Industries of Houston, 
which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange as a billiard table 
manufacturer. It was recently quoted at about a dollar a share. 
</P>
<P>
Of the unanswered but charged-for calls, Superfon said she would refund any 
justifiable costs on receipt of a complaining letter. She said there is a 
quality-control program to prevent such errors. 
</P>
<P>
Would she continue the current gab line and adult services in light of her 
future plans? 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely. People are lonely, have been lonely and always will be lonely." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, for many people the phone lines provide a real service for 
companionship, even though many of the people who link up by voice rarely see 
each other. "Telephones are really safe," she says. 
</P>
<P>
There is already the beginning of a second generation of telephone-line dating. 
From New York City comes word of a "Fax," or facsimile-transmitter club, which 
for a few hundred dollars will let you fax your message to someone else's fax, 
and never hear their voice if you don't want to. 
</P>
<P>
Industry-wide, most dial-it entrepreneurs would talk only on a 
not-for-attribution basis. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Elwell, editor of the Information Industry Bulletin, one of the few 
authoritative sources in the dial-it industry, says using the telephone for 
information is nothing new. New York telephone operators have been giving the 
time of day since the late 1920s, with the weather and traffic information 
following. The old operator and the party line were avenues for news and 
gossip. 
</P>
<P>
Advertising is a major expense for today's purveyors. Small operations rely on 
word-of-mouth and matchbook covers to pass on tantalizing phone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Bigger operators use television. Evening television movies are interrupted with 
all kinds of invitations, sometimes attractive young women, purring, "There's a 
party on your line whenever you want. Call as often as you want." 
</P>
<P>
Businesses that deal in sex have never been known for truth in advertising, but 
the expansion and invasion of the information telephone services, sanctioned by 
state and local authorities, is becoming troublesome to many. 
</P>
<P>
In California, the state legislature and the Public Service Commission made it 
mandatory for the telephone company to block lines to such calls at the 
customer's request. Pacific Bell has a suit pending against a dozen dial-a-porn 
operators to force them to cease and desist on the basis that they are damaging 
Pacific Bell's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
New York Telephone says it makes an effort to survey the talk lines and 
operators are required to provide monitors who can cut off disruptive or 
obscene callers. While this works on some lines, it doesn't seem to work on 
others. 
</P>
<P>
New York Telephone will now block dial-it calls from residences for free. Until 
this January, there was a $5 charge. Businesses must pay $10 and up, depending 
on the number of lines. 
</P>
<P>
The company will also cancel the charges the first time, if the customer 
complains that a child or teen-ager made the calls without parental permission. 
After that, the customer is urged to have the line blocked, or keep their 
youngsters off the phone. 
</P>
<P>
The phone company loses nothing. It gets half the charge whether the dial-it 
service collects or not. One West Coast company says uncollected calls cost it 
$400,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Bell shut down dial-a-porn services in Miami and Atlanta in 1984 and 
so far has been upheld by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
The option of blocking calls apparently did not reach Vilma Lantiqua, a 
49-year-old mother of a 17-year-old high school dropout in New York City. Her 
son, Sergio, had run up a $1,400 phone bill calling various party lines. In 
desperation she put the phone in her daughter's padlocked bedroom. So one night 
in January, Sergio broke into his mother's bedroom, stuffed a sock in her mouth 
and strangled her, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case this spring in which a 
California dial-a-porn operator, Sable Communications in the Los Angeles area, 
is challenging bans on dial-a-porn as abridgements of freedom of speech. 
</P>
<P>
The law under contest is a 1988 federal statute that bans sexually explicit 
telephone message services. The law prohibits any obscene or indecent 
communications for commercial purposes over interstate lines. It provides for 
fines up to $500,000 and prison terms up to two years. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever course the Supreme Court decides, there are a number of area phone 
companies which, fearing adverse reaction will affect the telephone information 
business in general, are planning to curtail or segregate the pornographic and 
gab lines. 
</P>
<P>
The revenues are important. One New York state official said the information 
services help subsidize the general telephone services. 
</P>
<P>
Those services that cater to homosexuals are more serious than other gab lines. 
They permit callers to talk with a group or "barhop" by pressing a designated 
key on push-button phones. One operator of such lines says they perform a real 
service, all the more critical in the gay community since the AIDs epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
"Talking to someone before jumping into bed with him is a good thing to do," he 
says. "Gays take this more seriously than do the straights, who tend to goof 
off and hambone on the gab lines." 
</P>
<P>
Most often dial-it profits are illusory, a gamble at best. Quality equipment is 
expensive, some devices running $2,000 a line or more. They force a telephone 
line, capable of carrying two voices, to carry six to eight. 
</P>
<P>
Most operations start with bright ideas, some never come to fruition, some fail 
for lack of continuing innovation. It is a copycat business. Some reserved 
lines are still vacant. There are thousands more available. 
</P>
<P>
The reason, one said, is that the field is littered with dead bodies, lost 
fortunes. Yet there are 200 million telephones out there, each a potential 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Like many new ideas these days, this one started in the Western states. 
Ominously, that is where some of the harshest controls are showing up. 
</P>
<P>
But gab lines are not likely to go away. As one frequent caller says, "It's 
cheaper than going out." 
</P>
<P>
Or was.
