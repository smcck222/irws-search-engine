Swedish Foreign Minister Sten Sture Andersson shocked the nation with 
revelations he has been subjected to illegal electronic eavesdropping. He 
became the first high-ranking politician to corroborate a statement by the 
government's chief prosecutor, Jan Danielsson, that a number of top Swedish 
officials were bugged during the so far futile police hunt for the killer of 
former Prime Minister Olof Palme, slain in 1986. "I know I have been bugged. 
But I have good reason not to tell you when it happened or whether it was 
during my time as foreign minister," Andersson told reporters. Police Chief 
Bjorn Eriksson denied that police had bugged the foreign minister. "Nobody in 
the police force is bugging anybody," he said.

Four Scottish constables arrived in Boston to calm families who say they cannot 
put to rest loved ones killed by a terrorist bomb on Pan Am Flight 103 until 
the victims' personal belongings are returned to them. The senior police 
officers wanted to ease the pain and confusion felt by many families of the 259 
victims whose possessions have been withheld during the investigation of the 
Dec. 21 plane explosion over Lockerbie, Scotland. Assistant Chief Constable 
Paul Newell said he and his fellow officers also wanted to quell rumors that 
investigators had destroyed victims' property. He reassured more than 100 
people who had gathered that many of the victims' personal belongings would be 
returned. So far, police have found and catalogued more than 11,000 items 
strewn over 40 miles of Scottish countryside.

MORE SOLAR FLARES ERUPT AFTER BIG BLAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More large solar flares, each with the potential to disrupt radio transmissions 
and trigger aurora borealis, have erupted on the sun in the wake of an 
unusually large blast, researchers at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico 
said. A blast 36 times the size of Earth that occurred last Thursday on the 
sun's northeast quadrant was possibly the largest ever recorded, researchers 
said. Staff Sgt. Leroy Kirkegard said that the huge eruption of gas from the 
surface of the sun was followed by another large explosion the next morning and 
three more the following day. He said the flare Thursday measured a 4-brilliant 
rating, while the blast Friday measured a 3-brilliant. Flares that are big 
enough to disrupt radio transmissions are rated by astronomers from 
zero-brilliant to 4-brilliant.

Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole judged the political impact of the John Tower 
affair to be "sort of a wash," but the Kansas Republican warned Democrats that 
their decision to deal President Bush a historic defeat will not be forgotten 
soon. "George Bush, in my view, has got a pretty good memory," Dole said three 
days after Tower's rejection for the post of defense secretary. "He's not going 
to do anything bad, but he remembers who helps and who hurts in the process." 
Dole appeared on the NBC-TV news program "Meet the Press."

Sudan's State Council, the African nation's collective presidency, formally 
accepted the week-old resignation of Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi's Cabinet, 
paving the way for a new government. Mahdi, bowing to pressure from military 
and labor union leaders who three weeks ago gave him an ultimatum to end the 
six-year civil war in the south, said he will name a new government as soon as 
possible. The main issue is whether the militant National Islamic Front, which 
wants a military solution to the war, will figure in a new administration. 
Mahdi has accepted a U.N. proposal for a month's truce, but the rebel 
leadership in the south has not made a decision.

Thousands of armed police and Chinese troops patrolled the riot-scarred streets 
of the Tibetan capital, checking identification cards and making arrests, 
sources in Lhasa said. Reached by telephone from Beijing, the sources said 
there was no overt evidence of anti-Chinese unrest in Lhasa as security forces 
maintained an iron grip on the city during its fifth day under martial law. 
Residents and foreign travelers have placed the number of arrests since the 
imposition of martial law at more than 1,000. The decree was imposed after 
three days of rioting by Tibetans.

Israeli soldiers killed two Palestinian guerrillas who entered Israel's 
self-declared security zone in southern Lebanon on a mission to infiltrate the 
Jewish state. The armed guerrillas were spotted on the edge of the security 
zone, about five miles north of the Israeli border. No Israeli troops were 
injured, military officials said. The radical Popular Front for the Liberation 
of Palestine-General Command issued a statement saying the guerrillas were part 
of a squad on a military operation. The confrontation, the third between 
Palestinians and Israelis in less than three weeks, is expected to increase 
Israeli demands that Washington halt its talks with the Palestine Liberation 
Organization.

excusing himself for a restroom break. Authorities believe Jose Luis Anaya, 27, 
is probably headed south to his hometown of San Diego, said prison public 
information officer Oliver Green, who added that Anaya is considered dangerous. 
Anaya was described as five feet, eight inches tall, weighing 145 pounds with

U.S. SHORTAGE OF CATHOLIC PRIESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Archbishop Mahony is quoted as supporting priestly celibacy since "married 
priests would not live at the parish rectory or be available seven days a week 
. . . because of family commitments they would be like others who live with 
family at home and work certain hours." 
</P>
<P>
This is a highly unreal and removed view of the matter. Married priests in the 
Episcopal and Orthodox churches serve their people with time and attention 
fully equal to those of their Roman counterparts (as do ministers in Protestant 
churches). Some of these priests do live in parish rectories, although many 
these days prefer to live a reasonable distance away, but the latter are easily 
available via telephone and automobile. 
</P>
<P>
I have been a married Episcopal priest for 45 years, and I have never 
experienced an insurmountable conflict between family and duty. You simply work 
out whatever time is required for either. To state that clergy such as myself 
"live with family at home and work certain hours" is a distorted view of the 
actual situation. I, for one, have no hard and fast daily schedule; I simply 
respond to whatever has to be done anytime. 
</P>
<P>
Celibacy has its own problems, and there is no sound rationale for imposing it 
upon all as an unvarying requirement for priesthood. Even St. Peter had a wife 
("Jesus went to Peter's house and found Peter's mother-in-law in bed with a 
fever." Matthew 8:14). Nowadays, especially, we need to engage the whole 
spectrum of priestly ministry, married as well as celibate, and give every 
qualified person the opportunity to serve God and human beings.

U.S. SHORTAGE OF CATHOLIC PRIESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The March 1 article neglected to include the major reason for a lack of 
vocations. Vocations are given by God, but fostered or killed by the family 
environment. Given the average Catholic family is neutral or outright negative 
towards religious vocations coming from their children, coupled with an 
emphasis on being successful in a materialistic sense, it is no wonder that so 
few respond to God's call. 
</P>
<P>
Until we as Catholics put our faith first in our lives instead of as merely an 
appendage, we will continue to have few priests. It has been said that we are 
given the number of vocations that we deserve. Nothing could be more true.

STEEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I thought your editorial "Steel's Bad Habits" (Feb. 11) was an interesting 
discussion but perhaps a bit oversimplified and a might short of the mark. 
</P>
<P>
It should be noted that the import restrictions you refer to are known as the 
Voluntary Restraint Agreements and were negotiated by the executive branch of 
our government as a means of combatting unfairly traded imports of steel 
products. In short, the dumping of imports that were subsidized by foreign 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
During the period of 1982-1984, domestic steel producers, complying with 
existing U.S. trade laws, filed a massive number of unfair trade cases against 
many importing countries. The Administration, recognizing that the courts would 
rule these cases valid, elected to initiate voluntary restraint discussions 
with key foreign governments in order to encourage domestic producers to 
withdraw their complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Having over 30 years of experience with the steel industry on the West Coast, I 
can assure you that the glut of excess worldwide steel capacity and the actions 
of foreign governments to subsidize their own industries is, indeed, the very 
root of the problem. Realistically, should our domestic steel industry be 
expected to suffer injuries inflicted by unfair foreign traders seeking a share 
of the U.S. market through the use of predatory practices? 
</P>
<P>
The VRAs are starting to have the effect of leveling the playing field and 
should be extended.

ETHICS BILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The eight-bill ethics package jointly proposed by the Fair Political Practices 
Commission and Ted Lempert, the young Democratic assemblyman from San Mateo 
(Part I, Feb. 23), is a welcome reform plan that Southern Californians should 
endorse. The FPPC figures on gifts and honorariums collected by the Legislature 
are overwhelming -- $3.2 million worth of gifts and honorariums for 120 
legislators in just three years -- and only underscore the importance of the 
ethics bills Lempert and the FPPC are trying to enact. 
</P>
<P>
It is not surprising that the California Legislature, awash in all this 
special-interest money, has such a hard time addressing the state's pressing 
concerns. What is amazing is that we've had to wait this long for someone like 
Lempert to raise the banner of reform. Is the answer young blood?

EDUCATION AS SCAPEGOAT IN STATE FISCAL WOES; 
</P>
<P>
PROPOSITION 98 FUNDING MEASURE IS NO EXCUSE TO BEGGAR HEALTH AND WELFARE 
PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
California schools are once again caught in the midst of the state budget 
battle and they are being blamed unfairly for the state's fiscal woes. 
</P>
<P>
Voters showed their support for our schools and the future of our children when 
they passed Proposition 98 last November. Proposition 98 does three things: It 
provides schools with a minimum guarantee of state funds so that eventually 
kindergarten through 12th grade schools and community colleges can receive 
enough money to stay even with inflation and enrollment growth; it calls for 
any "surplus" funds, that is revenue above the state spending limit, to be 
invested in schools to improve education; and it requires stricter 
accountability by requiring each school to issue a report card describing its 
own performance. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, some of the state's leaders are using Proposition 98 as a 
scapegoat for California's fiscal problems. They are claiming that Proposition 
98 gives "extra" money to schools, forcing cuts in other programs. These 
allegations are inaccurate. Projections by the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst 
indicate that per pupil expenditures, when adjusted for inflation, will 
actually decline next year. 
</P>
<P>
While the state is facing a very real fiscal problem, it is not because of 
Proposition 98. The real culprit is an unintentional $1 billion tax cut that 
forced the entire reserve to be used up this year. The Deukmejian 
Administration does not seem prepared to correct this tax windfall, and so it 
has proposed substantial program cuts next year. To make matters worse, the 
Administration is dodging its responsibility for this problem by attempting to 
shift the blame to Proposition 98 and pit education against health, welfare, 
and other vital programs. 
</P>
<P>
Each year the governor and the Legislature must decide how to spend added 
revenues resulting from economic growth. The new monies are used to meet needs 
caused by increased population, to maintain purchasing power and to provide new 
or expanded services. In 1989-90 this new revenue amounts to $2.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 98 assures that schools and community colleges receive a high 
enough share of the $2.9 billion in new state revenues to keep their overall 
portion of the state budget from dropping. 
</P>
<P>
The governor has stated that, because of Proposition 98, schools will receive 
an additional $400 million in the 1989-90 budget, forcing other programs, such 
as health and welfare, to be cut by approximately that amount. But that is not 
correct. Out of a $2.9 billion total in new revenues, Proposition 98 provided 
schools with just $920 million this year, compared to $977 million from the 
same total last year. Thus, out of an equal amount of new revenues, schools are 
receiving less new money after the passage of Proposition 98 than before. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 98 has stabilized education's share of the budget at a low level 
compared to previous years, even though our enrollment this year is growing by 
more than 140,000 children, or 3%. The educational community asked the public 
to pass Proposition 98 to prevent substantial cuts below the level needed for 
schools to keep even with inflation and to pay for enrollment growth. That is 
exactly what the measure is doing, but it does not provide any additional 
funding above maintenance levels for 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
Since schools did not receive an "extra" $400 million, why does the governor's 
budget propose almost $400 million in health and welfare cuts? 
</P>
<P>
The major reason is that nearly one-third of $2.9 billion in next year's new 
revenues is being proposed to be used to rebuild this year's reserve fund. This 
year's entire reserve is being used to forestall cuts in programs due to a 
revenue shortage of $1 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
How did that happen? The state, in an attempt to conform its tax laws with 
federal tax reform legislation, miscalculated and ended up reducing state 
revenues by $1 billion. Moreover, the largest beneficiaries were the state's 
wealthiest taxpayers, who received a $1 billion tax windfall by mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of blaming Proposition 98, the governor and Legislature have several 
options to provide full inflation and growth adjustments to those health and 
welfare programs singled out for cuts. They can do just what was done last year 
-- when the reserve was rebuilt to only $600 million instead of $900 million. 
They also can take the following steps: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rescind the unintended tax reduction for the wealthy for one year, which 
would make $1 billion available for programs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Close tax loopholes to conform to more recently passed federal legislation, 
which would provide $250 million to $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stop giving away sources of revenue. The 1986 unitary tax cut could 
potentially give foreign corporations a windfall of more than $100 million. It 
should be repealed. 
</P>
<P>
What our leaders cannot do is make schools pay the price for poor fiscal 
planning by substantially reducing the schools' share of new money. Schools 
paid the price in 1987, when the governor and Legislature balanced the budget 
by reducing the schools' share by $400 million below what it took to keep even 
with inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Education is the not the enemy of health and welfare. We all have a stake in 
correcting California's fiscal problems. We all should demand that our leaders 
do so. With the passage of Proposition 98, schools can no longer be used to 
help balance the state budget. And that is exactly what the voters wanted.

Has this ever happened to you? 
</P>
<P>
You're walking through the city park when suddenly you spot a bevy of healthy 
quail strutting between the bushes. 
</P>
<P>
You whip out your grenade . . . and just as you're clamping your teeth on the 
pin, you stop -- because you realize you'd be breaking the law. 
</P>
<P>
Or you're walking past the civic center, where thousands of peace terrorists 
are demonstrating against legitimate defense expenditures. You want to make a 
powerful statement and a quick getaway with a well-tossed grenade, but the law 
says you're a criminal if you carry one, so you left yours at home. 
</P>
<P>
Well, you're not alone. We of the National Assn. of Grenade Owners are working 
for the decriminalization and legalization of hand grenades for personal use -- 
hunting, fishing and self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with the AACLU (Americans Against Civil Liberties and Unions), 
we've been advancing our cause through billboards, matchbook covers and 
intimidation of congressional leaders. (By the way, we've recently changed the 
name of our legislative influence-peddling group from the grenade lobby to the 
grenade lob. It's shorter and punchier.) 
</P>
<P>
We feel good about the use of grenades, but because they're illegal, we 
God-fearing, law-abiding, patriotic citizens are considered outlaws. 
</P>
<P>
Now the anti-gun nuts want to take away our AK-47 assault rifles, which is 
blatant discrimination against us sportsmen with bad eyesight. (That's why I 
use grenades -- I mean, that's why I would use them if they weren't against the 
law.) 
</P>
<P>
So, in order to keep ourselves in the news and keep those checks flowing into 
headquarters, we're broadening our cause beyond grenades, to include the right 
to semi-automatic weapons and to fight these fanatics who want to restrict our 
rights even further. 
</P>
<P>
It's not just sportsmen I'm speaking on behalf of. Grenades are quite effective 
as well for termite work and preparing your vegetable garden. And a lot of us 
just like to collect them. Just as we like to collect AK-47 rifles. Stamps and 
coins are for kids. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Grenade Owners supports the right of free men to bear 
armaments. We oppose any restriction against AK-47 rifles, and we support the 
legalization of hand grenades. 
</P>
<P>
We don't want to break the law. We just want to write it.

MOSCOW'S PUZZLE IS HOW TO MOTIVATE THE SOVIET WORKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
First there was glasnost and perestroika. Now the latest buzzword in Soviet 
intellectual circles is uskorenie -- the goal of accelerating economic growth. 
Perestroika is the engine of uskorenie, and it is already threatening to run 
out of steam. In a highly publicized speech to industrial workers at Communist 
Party headquarters last week , President Mikhail S. Gorbachev stated the 
reason: "The policy of perestroika will bog down if we fail to rally people to 
its cause." Translation: Perestroika is bogged down and impassive workers are 
to blame. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's speech should be a clear message for Western pundits who have been 
speculating about the strength of his position. With most of the ruling 
Politburo -- including the discontented conservatives -- literally standing 
behind him, he explicitly denied that there is any immediate threat to his 
presidency. His real concern is that Soviet the workers are unconvinced and 
unmotivated by perestroika. Gorbachev's pressing challenge -- and his only 
legitimate hope -- lies in finding a way to motivate a work force that may be 
vaguely supportive of his goals, but is lacking in the political and economic 
experience to identify with, much less take specific action to implement, them. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent trip across the Soviet Union, we observed some of the basis for 
Gorbachev's frustration. All of the Soviets we talked with believed that 
perestroika and uskorenie were necessary, worthy ideas. But only the 
intellectuals, who have benefitted from greater freedom under glasnost, 
expressed any sense that daily life had actually changed. Most others 
characterized the reforms as "talk," and it is likely to stay that way for the 
foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
The workers we talked with were at least willing to recognize that the No. 1 
problem is poor productivity. But the overwhelming majority tended to lay blame 
on almost anyone but themselves. The explanations were in the nature of "Stalin 
eliminated the most productive citizens" and "Gosplan (the government's 
centralized planning authority) generates too many orders for useless products 
and not enough orders for much needed products." Notably absent was any 
reference to the worker alcoholism, absenteeism and general lethargy that 
continue to cripple factories and other workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
That the workers recognize neither their share of responsibility for the 
economic woes, nor the critical role of the individual in improving 
productivity, is not surprising. Today's Soviet work force is borne of a system 
that for generations treated the individual as little more than a meaningless 
cog in the wheel of production. 
</P>
<P>
The Russian Revolution was supposed to result in a "dictatorship of the 
proletariat," in which, at least according to the leaders' rhetoric, the 
workers would exercise some political choice and be the master of their own 
economic destiny. But by 1918, less than a year after the revolution, Lenin had 
already judged that the proletariat was not ready to be its own dictator. 
Although he implemented some market reforms designed to offer economic 
incentives in the early 1920s, Lenin did not permit the development of 
political institutions and practices necessary to move his economic program 
beyond the realm of ideas. Instead, the Central Committee stripped the 
individual of virtually all power by establishing the Communist Party as the 
vanguard of the revolution on behalf of the masses. The phrase "dictatorship of 
the party" officially replaced "dictatorship of the proletariat." The 
dictatorship of the party soon became the dictatorship of Lenin, a situation 
brutally institutionalized by Stalin and continued until Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
This centralization of political and economic power has at best discouraged, 
and at worst viciously punished individual initiative and innovation. Having 
endured decades of powerlessness and alienation from the basic decisions that 
affect their working lives, the Soviet people seem numb. Most appear to have 
given up questioning certain "basic facts": The party and the leader dictate 
terms of production. The people produce what they are told to and receive what 
the leadership decides to send their way. Problems are solved by some agency in 
Moscow, not by the assistant plant manager in Irkutsk. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly Gorbachev is changing the rules. He is telling workers that poor 
productivity is their problem, and that they, not Moscow, are responsible for 
improving performance. He is not only inviting but demanding individual 
participation and initiative. The talk is of a new relationship between the 
state and civil society, in which individuals can have an economic stake and 
make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
The workers deserve and will need much cajoling. Even before the revolution 
there never was a tradition of individual economic enterprise. Gorbachev must 
invent, not just reawaken, the entrepreneurial spirit. 
</P>
<P>
He can start chipping away at chronic passivity by offering some short-term 
incentives. The Soviets are borrowing billions of dollars from Western banks. 
By placing imported consumer goods financed with these loans on Soviet shelves, 
Moscow can showcase some of the potential benefits of harder work and improved 
productivity. Holding out the goal of a convertible ruble might also stimulate 
participation inasmuch as it implies that the workers might one day be able to 
spend some of their 300 billion stockpiled rubles on coveted Western products. 
</P>
<P>
All of this, however, would unlikely be enough to produce a watershed 
transformation in worker attitudes. Painfully aware of this, Gorbachev has 
introduced the concept of "reunification of power and production." He seems to 
be contemplating the development of a decentralized democracy in which crucial 
economic and political decisions are made in plants, towns and cities, rather 
than in Moscow. If this is pursued seriously, it would reinforce what is so far 
only talk of worker participation with institutions essential to guarantee that 
such participation is meaningful. 
</P>
<P>
The idea evokes a truly dignified role for the individual in the production 
process, for the first time in Soviet history. It may yet be the most 
provocative product of perestroika, but it is only a bare necessity on the road 
to uskorenie.

CALARTS MUSIC FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY McQUILKIN

<P>
At CalArts' Contemporary Music Festival, some things remain constant, year to 
year. Lots of composers are represented, the intermissions are too long and the 
most important concerts tend to be held in the Main Gallery, where sight-lines 
are poor and distractions are many. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, most programs will yield two or three memorable works. By itself, 
Earl Kim's "Now &amp; Then," one of seven works on the Saturday evening program 
by the New CalArts Twentieth Century Players, with guests, made the trip to 
Valencia worthwhile. Over a sparse but evocative accompaniment of flute, viola 
and harp, texts by Beckett, Chekhov and Yeats are set to striking and very 
lyrical vocal lines, effectively delivered here by soprano Catherine Gayer. 
</P>
<P>
Timbre is the organizing element in Mel Graves' "Watercourse." The extended 
performance techniques employed by the composer (such as bassoon multiphonics) 
did not simply result in a string of special effects , but as a source of 
fascinating color variation. Bassoonist Julie Feves and bassist Patrick Neher 
gave an assured reading. 
</P>
<P>
Effective use of color also helped maintain interest in Kathleen St. John's 
relatively concise "Heliotrope," played by a faculty wind quintet and heard in 
its West Coast premiere. 
</P>
<P>
The prolific German composer Hanns Eisler was represented in selections from 
"Die Hollywood Elegien." With clarity and directness, Gayer sang the tawdry 
Bertold Brecht texts, and pianist Leonard Stein provided reliable 
accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the catchiness of its jazz rhythms, Ed Bland's "Paean for an 
Endangered Planet," heard in its world premiere, sounds like a dry, academic 
counterpoint assignment. Also on the program were Craig Bove's "Nightscape," 
(another world premiere) a work sorely in need of variety, and minimalist 
Harold Budd's "Madrigals of the Rose Angel," in which pleasant-sounding 
sonorities go absolutely nowhere. Bruce Hangen conducted the works by Bland and 
Budd. TERRY McQUILKIN

"Tom Cruise is alive and well and in Los Angeles -- and doing his regular 
stuff, now that he's over the flu," declared his personal publicist on Friday. 
Spokeswoman Andrea Jaffe went on to decry recent London newspaper reports that 
said the actor had checked into a Paris hospital to undergo tests for AIDS and 
other illnesses. "Those London papers started out by claiming Tom had a 'deadly 
tropical disease' -- they put it in big headlines. Now it's come to this," said 
Jaffe, adding that "Tom is really (angry) about all this and has been talking 
with his lawyers." According to Jaffe, Cruise was in London to attend the 
British premiere of "Rain Man" and to promote the film when he came down with 
the flu. After six days in London, Cruise headed to Paris. When his temperature 
reached "around 103 or 104," he decided to check into the American Hospital in 
Paris. Said Jaffe: "He was there for several days and they ran a series of 
tests -- which were all negative. They told him he just had a bad flu, they got 
his temperature down and he came home." Cruise is currently in post-production 
on the Oliver Stone-directed "Born on the Fourth of July" and is due to begin 
his next film in May. ALEENE MacMINN and Shauna Snow

The producers of "Cheers" have lined up Oscar nominee John Cleese ("A Fish 
Called Wanda") for a guest role on their NBC comedy series when he comes into 
town to attend the Academy Awards later this month. Cleese will reprise his 
role of Dr. Simon Finch-Royce, a school chum of Dr. Frasier Crane (Kelsey 
Grammer) and fellow psychiatrist. In the episode (expected to air in April), 
Dr. Finch-Royce, an expert in marriage and family counseling, will be visiting 
the United States to promote his book, "Successful Marriage and Fidelity." In 
real life, Cleese wrote (with psychiatrist Robin Skynner) a book titled 
"Families -- How to Survive Them," that treats the subject seriously -- but 
with humor. ALEENE MacMINN and Shauna Snow

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: MEDIA / KEVIN BRASS; 
</P>
<P>
RADIO TURNS ADVERTISING DIAL TO SAN DIEGO BUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It seems unusual, that of all the businesses in San Diego, buses are 
particularly attractive as radio station advertising vehicles. Radio stations 
dominate local bus advertising, evidenced by the ads on San Diego Transit 
buses. 
</P>
<P>
"Radio stations are 50% of my business," said Jim Cox, vice president of sales 
for Michael Allen Associates, which handles advertising for San Diego Transit. 
</P>
<P>
Buses have several attributes which make them appealing to radio stations. For 
one, barring unforeseen troubles, buses are outdoors, easily seen by people in 
cars and at the beach or parks. Most people listen to car radios. A station may 
not have the time or space to develop its image in a bus ad, but the ads 
provide an opportunity to get the stations call letters in front of people. 
</P>
<P>
"Transit is not a medium to make a point," KFMB promotions director Joan Hiser 
said. "It's just call-letter reinforcement." 
</P>
<P>
All radio stations, from the elevator music of KJQY-FM (103.7) 
</P>
<P>
to the hard rock of KGB-FM (101.5), target listeners in their cars. It doesn't 
take a media genius to figure out that people see a lot of buses while they're 
out in their cars. 
</P>
<P>
"What is happening in San Diego is a tremendous increase in the time people 
spend in their automobiles," KYXY-FM (96.5) general manager Jim Price said. 
</P>
<P>
For smaller stations like KYXY, buses can represent a good chunk of their 
advertising budget. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the most affordable medium in town for the exposure you get," Cox 
boasted. 
</P>
<P>
The stations simply look at the bus ads as inexpensive, compared to other 
mediums. Cox said a large bus ad can cost between $88 and $108 per bus a month. 
</P>
<P>
"Outdoor billboards are more expensive and I can't get the quantity," said 
Hiser of KFMB. "I can get on a lot of buses and be downtown, plus I can get the 
commuters." 
</P>

Advertisers seek to dominate or at least saturate a medium, Price said. Most of 
the smaller stations can't afford to produce a television commercial, let alone 
saturate television. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to spend $50,000 for a good commercial," Price said. "I'm able to 
afford buses enough to dominate." 
</P>
<P>
Not all radio stations use buses. KCBQ (Eagle 105) marketing and promotions 
director Leslie O'Neal said she is considering using buses in the future, but 
recently opted instead for billboards. For one thing, she worries about the 
subliminal effect should a bus inadvertently cut off a commuter. She worries 
the driver would look up and see her station's call letters. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, "Buses go to bed at night," O'Neal said. "If I'm going to spend 
money on advertising I want it to be available at night." 
</P>
<P>
When KCBQ (Eagle 105) afternoon disc jockey Bill Moffitt received a collect 
call from James Brown, he thought it was a joke, so he refused to accept the 
charges. As it turned out, it was the James Brown, currently serving a jail 
term for various bizarre transgressions. Eagle 105 had been trying to arrange a 
phone interview with Brown for several days. Ultimately, the station did get an 
interview when John Forsythe called the singer's music company and Brown 
happened to be on another line. The next day Forsythe played a joke on Moffitt, 
calling him on the air to ask if he would accept a collect call from James 
Brown. Moffitt hung up.

KGTV (Channel 10) has moved "A Current Affair," infamous for its in-depth 
exposes on women's lingerie, into the 7 p.m. weeknight time slot, replacing 
"People's Court," which was moved to 3 p.m. "Current Affair," which was running 
on weekends on Channel 10, may be the quintessential show of the Sleaze TV Era. 
It's a ratings monster. Officials at Channel 10 only had to look at the show's 
performance at 7:30 p.m. on KTTV (Channel 11), the independent station out of 
Los Angeles, to see what an early evening ratings power the show could be. 
</P>
<P>
"It probably is the granddaddy of tabloid TV," Channel 10 program director Don 
Lundy said. "But we think there is a market for it. If people want to watch, we 
will provide it for them." 
</P>
<P>
Warner Brothers, syndicators of "People's Court," encouraged Channel 10 to 
switch its show to 3 p.m., Lundy said. Channel 10 was one of the last stations 
in the country still showing "People's Court," the granddaddy of the TV Trial 
Era, at night. 
</P>
<P>
NBC-TV has signed a new two-year contract extension with KNSD-TV, squelching 
rumors that the top-rated network was looking to switch to KFMB-TV (Channel 8). 
The announcement was made by the president of NBC Television, Pierson Mapes, 
who was hunkered down in La Costa last week with network executives. . . . XETV 
(Channel 6) has been sending out copies of its new show "Cops" to San Diego 
Police Chief Bob Burgreen and others to get their response to the show, the 
latest to bring real-life crime into the homes of Americans. . . . Channel 39's 
"Third Thursday" will focus on abortion, 6:30 p.m., Thursday. . . .Channel 39 
is moving Bernard Gonzales to the weekend anchor desk. He'll team with Kim 
Devore. "I just wanted to strengthen our stable of anchors by developing new 
anchors," Channel 39 News Director Nancy Bauer said. . . . Former Airwatch 
Traffic reporter Nina Reeba has joined KSDO-AM (1130) as associate producer. 
</P>
<P>
Ernie Myers, dumped by KSDO in December after nine years with the station, is 
looking for work with the help of an agent in Los Angeles. He recently returned 
from a golf trip to Hawaii and he's staying busy with free-lance work. 
</P>

In a reversal of a two-year-old policy, the San Diego Sheriff's Department is 
now giving reporters access to police reports. To the frustration of the local 
media, the Sheriff's Department, in sharp contrast to other local law 
enforcement agencies, refused to make the "narrative" sections of reports 
available to the public, forcing reporters to rely on verbal reports from 
department representatives. A sheriff's spokesperson told the Blade Tribune 
that the changes would bring the department's policy "more in compliance with 
what was articulated in the government code," but denied that the action was 
related to a recent lawsuit seeking information about sheriff's operations and 
personnel filed by The Times or the threat of litigation from other papers over 
the legality of the old policy.

MASTER CHORALE PERFORMS 'ELIJAH' AT DOROTHY CHANDLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN

<TEXT>

Mendelssohn's "Elijah" brought out the Los Angeles Master Chorale and Sinfonia 
in their largest, grandest manifestations, Saturday evening at the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion. It also brought out a big effort from music director John 
Currie, appropriately swift and dramatic in the first half, meditative or 
majestic in ending. 
</P>
<P>
For some of the pre-intermission airs, the pace proved a little too quick, but 
the choruses were taut and vivid. From the opening cries of "Help, Lord!" the 
choir made its weight felt and demonstrated the ability and will for narration 
as well as action. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the choral power, the Sinfonia covered the chorus in its lower range in 
the most active portions. Otherwise, its support was vigorous, occasionally 
crude in intonation and ensemble, but providing a full, Romantic palette. 
</P>
<P>
In the multifarious title role was baritone Herbert Eckhoff, singing with 
ringing, orotund authority. The stentorian glories were largely 
undifferentiated in the first half, whether taunting the priests of Baal or 
pleading with the Lord. He found only slightly more vocal variety for the 
exalted despair of "It is enough," but rode the big climaxes easily. 
</P>
<P>
Soprano Juliana Gondek, mezzo Christine Cairns and tenor Jonathan Mack supplied 
fluent, assured sounds in their airs and ensembles, and varying degrees of 
characterization. Cathy Larsen sang the bright watch cries of the Youth. JOHN 
HENKEN

Rock Star Jon Bon Jovi was picked up by police at 3:30 a.m. Friday morning for 
trespassing on a closed skating rink in New York's Central Park. Police said 
Bon Jovi, 27, his girlfriend and another couple were handcuffed by a parks 
department patrol officer and taken to the Central Park Precinct station house, 
where they were given summonses for trespassing at Wollman Rink and released 
within an hour. At the precinct house, Bon Jovi was a hit with police Sgt. Tony 
Michaled, who told United Press International on Saturday that the singer was 
"the nicest guy in the world." Bon Jovi performed with his band at a sold-out 
concert Friday night in New York. ALEENE MacMINN and Shauna Snow

POP CAPSULES : KARYN WHITE HEATS UP THE PALACE WITH ENERGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONNIE JOHNSON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With her wild mane of hair and barely there mini-dress, hot newcomer Karyn 
White headlined the Palace Friday and exhibited the offhand sexiness and 
unharnessed energy of Chaka Khan back in her Rufus days. White's 45-minute show 
had its rough edges, but her raw, energetic approach was refreshing in a time 
when so many entertainers are polished to high-gloss sterility. 
</P>
<P>
The petite singer, whose debut album has just passed the million-sales mark, 
opened with "The Facts of Love," the Jeff Lorber hit that introduced her to pop 
audiences. White engaged in a lot of Janet Jackson-esque choreography that drew 
heated response from her male fans, but id was her impassioned vocals on such 
numbers as "Superwoman" and "Love Saw It" (a duet with singer-producer 
Babyface) that really rocked the room. While as adept at dance hits as Jackson 
and Jody Watley, White is a far superior vocalist. She has a touch of Khan's 
earthy soul, and even Whitney Houston's authority. And a bright future. CONNIE 
JOHNSON

POP CAPSULES : COWBOY JUNKIES AT MCCABE'S: REASON TO BELIEVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The scene at McCabe's on Friday night seemed more like a midnight Mass than a 
pop concert: rows of people -- seated and hushed -- staring at a stage in a 
room illuminated only by candlelight. Could it be that the Cowboy Junkies, the 
evening's attraction, are getting a bit precious? Thankfully, no. 
</P>
<P>
If much of their audience treats them as rock's lastest Holy Grail, lead singer 
Margo Timmins and the rest of the seven-piece band went about business as 
usual. In its hourlong performance, the Canadian group -- whose music blends 
melancholy country and soft, soulful rock -- gave the fans new reasons to 
believe rather than simply replay old favorites. The best of the half-dozen new 
songs were captivating as the tunes from the Junkies' best-selling RCA LP. 
</P>
<P>
"Escape Is So Simple" offers the accessibility and emotional purity of 
"Misguided Angel," though this time the theme is about relationships moving 
apart rather than coming together. "Sun Comes Up, It's Tuesday Morning," which 
carries more of a lilt than past Junkies' tunes, overflows with conflicting 
images and moods a la Bob Dylan. "Thirty Summers" is a compelling look at 
loyalties and sanity, while "Cheap Is How I Feel" is as intriguing as its 
title. Much like Tracy Chapman last year, the Junkies are one of those pop 
rarities: an act blessed with critical and commercial support. From every sign 
Friday, that support is extremely well placed. ROBERT HILBURN

PALOMINO OFFERS SLICE OF KERRVILLE FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The annual Kerrville Texas Folk Festival, now in its 18th year, has a 
reputation as a place to find new talent -- an image boosted by the recent 
success of Michelle Shocked, who was "discovered" there in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But much of the show Saturday at the Palomino packaging a dozen Kerrville 
regulars showed that Kerrville's old talent shouldn't be overlooked. With each 
act taking the stage for three songs, the presentation virtually outlined the 
history of contemporary American folk music with a casual warmth and 
comfortable homeyness. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton Camp and Carolyn Hester -- two of many Los Angeles-based performers on 
the show -- each provided a link to the early-'60s folk boom with personable 
sets that linked their pasts to the present. 
</P>
<P>
A second generation was also well-represented, with Lucinda Williams (an L.A. 
club regular now, but a Kerrville performer as far back as 1974) and Texan 
Butch Hancock standing out. Williams worked in the country and blues branches 
of American folk with power and confidence, while Hancock -- best known for 
songs recorded by Joe Ely -- shone as the evening's top wordsmith. 
</P>
<P>
Appropriately, the outstanding set came from a relative newcomer, Boston-based 
Patty Larkin. With a commanding voice, accomplished songwriting touch and 
well-timed wit, Larkin (though not exactly a rookie) barely eclipsed young 
rock- and country-influenced Texas folkie David Halley as the evening's find. 
</P>
<P>
Rod Kennedy, Kerrville executive director, announced during Saturday's show 
that he hopes to establish a three-day Kerrville-style songwriters' festival in 
Los Angeles next year. This year's Texas festival will be held from May 25 to 
June 11. STEVE HOCHMAN

'GLORY OF EASTER' REACHES NEW HEIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eat your heart out, "Phantom of the Opera." 
</P>
<P>
For sheer spectacle, the long-awaited pop opera, soon to play the Ahmanson, may 
find it difficult to top "The Glory of Easter" at the Crystal Cathedral in 
Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"Easter" would certainly win first place in the angel category. Two angels waft 
over the audience, announcing the incipient Resurrection. Then four more fly in 
for the finale. Because the angels are so high (the ceiling is 12 stories above 
us) and the lighting (by Perry Halford and Terry Larson) so adroit, we can 
barely make out the wires. Peter Foy of Flying by Foy and Toni Elevi get the 
flying effects credit. 
</P>
<P>
It's such a breathtaking sight that you wish someone would sing "Angels, we 
have heard on high" -- until it occurs to you that those words are from a 
Christmas carol, not an Easter song. Which leads to the question: Why such an 
elaborate angelic display for the Easter story, most accounts of which have the 
angels simply appearing as strangers at the tomb? 
</P>
<P>
Because too much is never enough at "The Glory of Easter." Besides, the angels 
make a similar appearance at the Cathedral's "The Glory of Christmas." Why 
tamper with success? 
</P>
<P>
Most of the other elements of the spectacle are appropriate to the story, with 
one exception: green lasers that zip across the hall and land on the tomb, in 
order to help roll away the stone at the tomb entrance. The lasers are out of 
"Star Wars" or "Sunday in the Park With George" or a rock concert instead of 
Matthew, Mark, Luke or John. 
</P>
<P>
The thunder and lightning that climaxes the crucifixion, accompanied by the 
rumble of what sounds like an earthquake, is more scripturally based. The 
lightning is more painful to watch than real lightning, probably because most 
of the audience is seated so that we look straight at the flashes of light -- 
but then a peaceful crucifixion scene just wouldn't do the job. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the most gruesome aspect of that scene -- the nailing to the cross -- is 
done in darkness, while the light focuses on Mary (Kim Criswell, formerly 
Grizabella in "Cats") as she laments her son's fate. 
</P>
<P>
The animals are much easier to watch. The Romans ride real horses, the 
townspeople ride real donkeys and herd real goats through the marketplace. Some 
of these creatures are so charismatic that they distract attention from the 
conversation that's being conducted. This is especially true of Pontius 
Pilate's pet tiger. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that the conversation makes for difficult listening. Paul David Dunn's 
script is in plain, modern English: "The tribune and I are friends -- he owes 
me a favor," says one of the officials who's worried about Jesus. Maybe it's a 
bit too plain; the lyricism here is in the scenery, not in the text -- or the 
score or the performances, for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
That score, presumably assembled by musical director Johnnie Carl and partially 
written by Carl, is a stew of grandiose imitations of Miklos Rozsa (the taped 
orchestral selections) and sub-Broadway banality (the individually sung solos). 
With the vast resources of Christian sacred music at their disposal, Carl and 
producer/director Dunn should dispense with the original selections and rely on 
the masters -- or on gospel music, or classic hymns, or anything other than 
what he's got. 
</P>
<P>
The program lists one spiritual, "Were You There?," as part of the score, but 
it's background music, hardly noticeable. The finale, which uses the hymn 
"Christ the Lord Is Risen Today," is the high point of the score. 
</P>
<P>
The individual performances are of little consequence, which is perhaps just as 
well. In Criswell's big solo, the one moment when a performer really grabs the 
stage, she's a Broadway baby almost as much as Mary, mother of Jesus. Jonathan 
Fuller's Jesus is well-spoken, but not one moment of his performance catches 
anyone by surprise. He's a three-dimensional version of the most conventional 
paintings of Jesus found in any Protestant church. 
</P>
<P>
 At Chapman Avenue and Lewis Street, Garden Grove, nightly at 6:30 and 8:30 
p.m., through March 26. Tickets: $14-$25; (714) 544-5679 or (213) 480-3232.

FORGET PRELIMINARIES, RED-HOT WHITE READY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
TEMPE, Ariz. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forget Palm Springs. Skip the Freeway Series. And bring on the Chicago White 
Sox. Devon White's ready for opening day and games that count, not to mention 
statistics that count. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' center fielder went three for three with a stolen base Sunday 
during the Angels' 10-8 victory over Seattle in Tempe Diablo Stadium. White, 
who has nine hits in his last 15 at bats, leads the team in batting (.467), 
hits (14), stolen bases (three), runs batted in (eight) and triples (two). He 
has driven in five runs in the last five games. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I see Devon White take a step, I get chills," Angel Manager Doug 
Rader said early Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The temperature peaked at 93 degrees later in the day, but Rader still must 
have been a mass of goose bumps during this game. 
</P>
<P>
"Devo's in real good shape up there at the dish," Rader said. "He's locked in 
real nice. I just hope he can hang on to the feeling and carry it over to 
opening day and through the season." 
</P>
<P>
Not as much as White does. The Angel center fielder is eligible for arbitration 
next year. At this pace, he would have 284 hits, 162 RBIs and a whole lot of 
money in the bank by this time next year. 
</P>
<P>
White admits he would like to feel this relaxed and confident when he steps to 
the plate on opening day, but says he's concentrating on "not getting too 
high." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just doing what Devon White does, nothing different," he said. "It'd be 
nice to get off to a good start. You don't want to fight from the cellar up. If 
anything, you'd like to start high and slowly go down." 
</P>
<P>
White knows all about uphill battles. He struggled in the early going last 
season and then it got worse in a hurry. He was hitting only .245 with two home 
runs and 11 RBIs on May 7 when he went on the 21-day disabled list after 
undergoing surgery to remove torn cartilage from his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
He was reactivated June 10 and was hitless in his next 23 at-bats. He did have 
a couple of mid-summer streaks, though, and finished the season with a .259 
average, 11 homers and 51 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
White is intent on improving those numbers this year and thinks some of the 
newest Angels will play an important role in that quest. 
</P>
<P>
Rader has not yet decided exactly where in the order White will hit -- he was 
batting third Sunday -- but whether it's second, third, fifth or sixth, White 
thinks he will see better pitches in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"I think having Claudell (Washington) and Lance Parrish in there will help, 
especially if I'm in the middle of the lineup somewhere," he said. "Being 
surrounded by Washington, Parrish, (Wally) Joyner and (Chili) Davis will be 
real nice." 
</P>
<P>
But when it comes to the numbers game, White is almost embarrassed about last 
year's stolen base total of 17. In 1987, when he was healthy all year, he stole 
32 bases. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know exactly what Rader thinks, but you hear all this stuff about how 
I'm one of the fastest players in the American League and then you see those 
numbers," White said. "He must think, 'What's going on?' " 
</P>
<P>
White has not had the OK to steal on his own in the past. So far this spring, 
though, Rader has set him loose. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe this year the organization will let me run like I can," White said. "If 
I have a decent on-base percentage, I can steal 50 or 60." 
</P>
<P>
If he hits anything like he has this spring, he might steal 100. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Dante Bichette continued his crusade to make the 24-man roster 
Sunday with his second three-run homer in the last four days. He also had a 
single to raise his average to .379. The Angels had 17 hits against Seattle 
pitching. Brian Downing also had a three-run homer and a single. Angel starter 
Chuck Finley yielded five hits and two runs in four innings. Reliever Bryan 
Harvey pitched two scoreless innings and allowed one hit. "A lot of guys did a 
lot of things well today," Manager Doug Rader said. . . . The Angels announced 
Sunday that pitcher Moose Haas has been released from his Edmonton contract by 
mutual agreement. Haas has been plagued by shoulder problems. . . . Moose 
Stubing, the Angel third base coach who is down to 210 after losing almost 60 
pounds, fell down while waving home Jack Howell in the ninth inning. "I didn't 
see it, but I felt it," Rader quipped. . . . Mike Fetters pitched four innings 
and allowed only one hit as the Angels beat San Diego, 11-3, in Sunday's 'B' 
game. Jim Eppard and Jeff Manto had three hits each, Mike Ramsey had two 
triples and Doug Davis drove in three runs. 
</P>
<P>
Rader says he is very pleased with the attitude in camp this spring, but he 
doesn't want to dwell on it. "It's relaxed here and people are very receptive 
to what we're trying to do," he said. "There's a sort of quiet confidence. But 
I think it's better not to talk about it. I subscribe to the theory that if 
it's not broken, don't fix it." . . . Catcher Bill Schroeder, after looking 
over the Angels' complicated pitching chart he was supposed to fill out during 
Sunday's game: "Do you think Whitey Ford had to do this kind of stuff?" . . . 
Al Campanis was on hand Sunday in Tempe Diablo Stadium to watch his grandson, 
Jim Campanis, who is in camp with the Mariners. The former Dodger general 
manager said his soon-to-be-released book may be titled, "My Turn at Bat."

RECORD DOESN'T SPEAK FOR ITSELF, MORGAN SAYS

<P>
The numbers say Mike Morgan isn't a winner. His lifetime major league record of 
34-68 is the worst of any active pitcher with 20 or more decisions. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to avoid an argument, though, don't confront Morgan with such 
statistical. The newest Dodger made it clear Sunday that he won't buy it. 
</P>
<P>
When Morgan, 29, checked into camp after having been acquired from the 
Baltimore Orioles Saturday for outfielder Mike Devereaux, reporters lost no 
time in making references to his past performance. 
</P>
<P>
The right-hander bristled a bit, then said: "There are a lot of people in 
baseball like that. It doesn't mean I'm a loser. I haven't been with the best 
of teams, either. Some guys are superstars from the start. Others take longer." 
</P>
<P>
For most of his six seasons in the majors, Morgan has toiled for teams that 
finished below .500. He broke in with the Oakland Athletics, then went to the 
New York Yankees, the Toronto Blue Jays, the Seattle Mariners and the Orioles. 
Only the Blue Jays had a winning record when he was with them. 
</P>
<P>
Still, wouldn't Morgan have to upgrade his pitching to turn his career around? 
</P>
<P>
"Not really," he said. "Being with a team like the Dodgers is sure to make a 
big difference. They're a great organization. They weren't just world champions 
last year. They've been up there almost every year. They're the type of team 
that's successful." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan's most victories came in 1987 when he was 12-17 with Seattle. But his 
earned-run average was 4.65. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a great year by any means," Morgan said. "I certainly wasn't 
satisfied. I'm never satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan's career was stunted because the Athletics brought him to the majors out 
of high school at Las Vegas. He was the fourth player picked in the amateur 
draft in 1978, behind Bob Horner, Lloyd Moseby and Hubie Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan's premature promotion was generally regarded as one of owner Charlie 
Finley's many publicity ploys. 
</P>
<P>
"That kept me from excelling," Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan hung around for only three starts, all of which he lost, before being 
sent to Vancouver. After that, he kept bobbing in and out of the majors until 
he finally stuck with the majors in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Since Morgan is a strong candidate for a starting job, his acquisition may lead 
to the demotion of rookie Ramon Martinez to triple-A Albuquerque. Martinez's 
spring earned-run average for four innings of work is 9.00. 
</P>
<P>
However, pitching coach Ron Perranoski said Sunday that he felt encouraged 
about Martinez after a long instructional session with the right-hander from 
the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
"We did a couple of things to modify his delivery," Perranoski said. "His 
mechanics have been off, and we're hoping the changes will give him some 
consistency." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Morgan won't have to wait long to get work. He is scheduled to 
pitch two innings against the Detroit Tigers at Lakeland today. 
</P>
<P>
"He got in only three innings with Baltimore this spring," Perranoski. "We'll 
start him with two innings, then three, and build him up to where he can start 
for us if necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Fernando Valenzuela pitched on the side before Sunday's game against the 
Houston Astros, then stalked away in frustration. He has a 12.60 ERA for two 
appearances in his attempted comeback from a shoulder injury. 
</P>
<P>
Told of Valenzuela's displeasure, Perranoski said: "He's just getting his arm 
strength back. That's the way bodies are made. You can't just go from A to Z. I 
don't think it's anything to write Ann Landers about." 
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Griffin continued his hitting spree Sunday, going three for four as the 
the Dodgers came from behind for a 7-6 victory in 11 innings. Griffin, who 
batted .199 last year, has 15 hits in 24 at-bats for an exhibition average of 
.556. 
</P>
<P>
The hero of the day, though, was rookie third baseman Dave Hansen, whose single 
off the Astros' Jeff Heathcock drove in non-roster outfielder Mike White with 
the tie-breaking run. White and Hansen were drafted one-two in 1986, and both 
played for the Dodgers' Class A Vero Beach farm club last year. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen, 20, who was born in Long Beach and attended Rowland High School in 
Rowland Heights, was excited. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just glad I impressed somebody," he said. "I know I'll more than likely go 
to Double-A this year, but this was kind of a thrill for me."

<P>
Strong northwest winds Sunday were pushing the 37 boats toward the finish line 
at near-record speed in Newport Harbor Yacht Club's race to Cabo San Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
At the 8 a.m. Sunday roll call, the Nelson-Marek 68 sloop Prima, skippered by 
Burton Benjamin of San Diego Yacht Club, was the leading the Class A fleet of 
ultra-light displacement boats, showing a distance of 193 miles from the start 
in 19 hours of sailing. Several of the big sleds were sailing within sight of 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
Elapsed time record for the 790-mile course is 2 days 22 hours 2 minutes 40 
seconds, which would mean the lead yacht would have to finish by 11 a.m. 
Tuesday to eclipse the record held by the Santa Cruz-70 Blondie. ALMON LOCKABEY

Dispersal fought off a late rally by Majesty's Imp, holding on in the home 
stretch to win the $150,000 Louisiana Derby Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Jockey Jose Santos took Dispersal to an early lead and had a two-length 
advantage coming around the final turn. Majesty's Imp moved up along the rail 
with one furlong to go, but Dispersal held on for the victory. The winning time 
for the 1 1/16 miles was 1:43 4/5. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a little green, but he sure has an awful lot of talent to be the third 
time out and win the Louisiana Derby," said Dispersal's trainer, Grover (Bud) 
Delp. "He's got to be a little special. I just hope he's as good tomorrow as he 
was today." 
</P>
<P>
Owned by Harry and Tom Meyerhoff of Maryland, Dispersal paid $9.00, $5.80 and 
$3.60. Majesty's Imp paid $9.20 and $4.20, and Dansil, the morning line 
favorite, paid $2.80 to show. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone here feels it's a good start toward the Triple Crown," Delp 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Risen Star, who won the Louisiana Derby last year, went on to win the Preakness 
and the Belmont Stakes.

NBA ROUNDUP;

CELTICS, TRYING TO FLY WITHOUT BIRD, BEAT DENVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the time that Larry Bird was expected to return from surgery to lead 
the Boston Celtics into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
But there has been a snag in the rehabilitation program following the operation 
Nov. 19 on both Achilles tendons. Bird is limping and the struggling Celtics 
will probably have to get into postseason play without their best player and 
inspirational leader. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics moved a little closer to their goal Sunday at Boston by coming from 
behind for a 121-115 victory over Denver, also missing its best player -- Fat 
Lever. 
</P>
<P>
Boston trailed, 112-109, with 2:28 remaining against a team that was road-weary 
and had won only six of 30 games away from home. But old pros Robert Parish and 
Kevin McHale scored the points to put the Celtics ahead and Reggie Lewis and 
Jim Paxson finished off the Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
Denver Coach Doug Moe complained about poor bench play when he took his 
regulars out for a short rest after building a 13-point lead. But in truth, it 
was the failure of Alex English to shoot well that was the undoing. 
</P>
<P>
English had 27 points, one fewer than Lewis, but, after getting 51 points in 
his previous game, he missed one easy short jumper after another. He was 12 for 
27, but six of his baskets were layups. With Lever, the playmaker and top 
rebounder, ailing, they needed a hot shooting English. 
</P>
<P>
Bird predicted he would be back by early March. He said he would fool the 
doctors. Last week it was decided he could engage in three hard workouts in 
four days. He came out of them with a swollen, very sore left foot. He will 
back off for a few days. 
</P>
<P>
According to Peter May of the Hartford Courant, the Celtics aren't considering 
it a major setback. 
</P>
<P>
"But it would be fair to say that it has not progressed the way we hoped it 
would," trainer Ed Lacerte told May. "We're going to take a step back until the 
tendon calms down. We're not ruling him out for the season." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Celtics are 30-30 and only three games ahead of Washington in the 
battle for the final playoff spot, there have been some pluses. Two youngsters 
who would not have played so much on a pennant-contending team, Lewis and Brian 
Shaw, have matured with regular action. They appear to be the backcourt combine 
for the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Celtics, even if they make the playoffs, will get a high draft choice 
for the first time in a long time. A year ago, although Bird was beginning to 
hurt, they were 41-19 after 60 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Nuggets, also in a tough struggle for a playoff berth in the West, sent 
Lever home for examination of a knee injury. If he is out for any time, the 
Nuggets will be hard-pressed to make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 110, Washington 104 -- Isiah Thomas scored four of his 22 points in an 
11-4 run in the fourth quarter at Auburn Hills, Mich., that finally subdued the 
stubborn Bullets. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons, the hottest team in the NBA, kept building a lead, but the Bullets 
kept fighting back. It was the 10th win in the last 11 games for the Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Laimbeer had a big game against the Bullets, who lack only a good center 
to be a tough foe, getting 24 points and 16 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 123, Portland 110 -- The Cavaliers, temporarily at least, put an end 
to their skid on the road when Larry Nance had 16 points and 14 rebounds and 
Brad Daugherty had 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers, who had lost two in a row, were playing their fourth game on the 
road in six nights. The hard-earned win kep the Cavaliers a game ahead in the 
tight race in the Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers led by six points at halftime, fell behind, 66-64, in the third 
quarter, then put on a 12-5 spurt to take the lead for good. The lead jumped 
top 95-81 in the fourth quarter and breezed to the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento 114, Charlotte 105 -- The addition of Wayman Tisdale and Danny Ainge 
have made the Kings better than an expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
Tisdale had 28 points and Ainge had 15 points and 10 assists at Charlotte to 
lead the win over the expansion team. DAN HAFNER

NHL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
LEMIEUX HAS NEW GOALS, LEADS PENGUINS PAST BLACKHAWKS, 6-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A late season slump cost Mario Lemieux his chance to break a couple of Wayne 
Gretzky's records, but he came out of his skid with a brilliant performance. 
</P>
<P>
Lemieux's goal now is to get a Patrick Division championship. Lemieux scored 
three goals and assisted on the other three Sunday at Chicago to lead the 
Pittsburgh Penguins to a 6-5 victory over the Blackhawks. It was only the 
Penguins' third win in the last 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Penguins, who moved to within a single point of division-leading 
Washington, needed Lemieux at his best. The Blackhawks stormed the Pittsburgh 
net, firing 62 shots, more than one a minute, at goaltender Tom Barrasso. 
</P>
<P>
A month or so ago, Lemieux was on a pace that would have broken Gretzky's 
records for goals (92) and points (215) in a season. Both were considered 
impossible to break. Perhaps they are. 
</P>
<P>
With 10 games to play, Lemieux has 70 goals and 179 points. It is unlikely he 
will score 22 more goals. He's a longshot to get 36 points, too. 
</P>
<P>
Lemieux did tie a Gretzky record that figured to last a long time. One of his 
goals was his 12th when his team was short-handed. 
</P>
<P>
In the previous three games Lemieux had only two points. Lemieux said it was 
just a matter of time "before I got back on track. But you have to build up to 
it. I was a little bit tired the last few games. But I guess today, I got my 
offense back." 
</P>
<P>
The Penguins, with 35 victories and 77 points, are certain to post their best 
record and get Lemieux into the playoffs for the first time in his fifth NHL 
season. But winning the division would make it sweeter. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Washington with 78 points, the New York Rangers are in the race. 
They have 76 points, all with 10 games remaining. The Rangers and Pittsburgh 
each have six at home, whereas Washington has five. However, the Capitals play 
the two weak clubs -- New Jersey and the Islanders -- twice apiece. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackhawks' hopes to make the playoffs in the Norris Division were damaged 
by the setback. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 5, St. Louis 3 -- The North Stars picked up a big dividend on their 
recent trade with Washington in this game at Bloomington, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Gartner, acquired from the Capitals, set up the tie-breaking goal by Don 
Barber, then scored himself to assure the victory. 
</P>
<P>
With the win, the North Stars pulled to within a point of the Blues in the 
battle for second place in the Norris Division. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 3, Hartford 3 -- Rick Tocchet scored his second goal of the game 
at Hartford with just 3:18 left in regulation to give the Flyers a hard-earned 
tie. 
</P>
<P>
An ill-timed clearing pass by Hartford's Ray Ferraro was picked off by Tocchet 
and he fired in his 39th goal of the season. The tie dropped Hartford four 
points behind Buffalo in the battle for third place in the Adams Division. 
</P>
<P>
The Flyers are within five points of the New York Rangers in the Patrick 
Division battle for third. 
</P>
<P>
Winnipeg 9, Toronto 7 -- Frederick Olausson scored one of his two goals in a 
three-goal burst in nine minutes in the first period at Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the wildest games of the year, the Maple Leafs, trailing 6-1, rallied 
to make a battle of it. The Jets hung on to end a five-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 3, Boston 2 -- The Sabres would like to finish second in the Adams 
Division and earn home ice advantage in the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
It just doesn't figure to make much difference. They have dominated the team 
they will play in the first round -- Boston -- posting a 5-0-3 record against 
the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
The Sabres trail the Bruins by four points with 10 games left. 
</P>
<P>
They won this game at Buffalo when Dave Andreychuk scored his second goal of 
the game early in the last period to break a 2-2 tie. DAN HAFNER

SOONERS SEEDED NO. 1 DESPITE LOSING BY 12 
</P>

<P>
Byron Irvin scored 29 points and Doug Smith had 22 points and 14 rebounds as 
10th-ranked Missouri upset No. 2 Oklahoma, 98-86, Sunday to win the Big Eight 
Conference tournament at Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the loss, Oklahoma received the No. 1 seeding in the Southeast Regional 
in Nashville, Tenn. The Sooners (28-5) will play East Tennessee State Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The seedings were announced on national television prior to the end of the Big 
Eight final, which Missouri dominated from the start. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers (27-7), who have won two of three from the regular-season Big Eight 
champion Sooners this season, will be the No. 3-seeded team at the Midwest 
Regional in Dallas, where they will play Creighton Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Stacey King, who played poorly in a 14-point effort against Iowa State in 
Saturday's semifinals, scored a tournament-record 38 Sunday. That equaled the 
combined output of 6-foot-10 Smith and 7-1 Gary Leonard, who had 16 for 
Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
But King didn't get much help from Oklahoma's perimeter players. The Sooners, 
who shot 42% compared to 66% for Missouri, scored only 19 points from outside. 
</P>
<P>
OTHER TOURNAMENTS

ACC 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina 77, Duke 74 -- By beating the No. 7 Blue Devils in the Atlantic 
Coast Conference final at Atlanta, the No. 9 Tar Heels won the tournament for 
the first time since 1982, when they also won the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Bucknall scored all 10 of his points in the final 5:28, twice making 
three-point plays, to lead North Carolina down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
The victory helped erase the memories of last year's 65-61 loss to Duke in the 
ACC final and kept the Tar Heels (27-7) close to home as the No. 2-seeded team 
in the NCAA Southeast Regional at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Duke (24-7), seeded No. 2 in the East Regional, will play South Carolina State 
Thursday night at Greensboro, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Duke, which trailed North Carolina by as many as 12 points in the first half, 
rallied to take a 59-57 lead with 5:44 left. But Bucknall scored his first 
points on a three-point play to give the Tar Heels a 60-59 lead with 5:28 left. 
Bucknall's second three-point play gave the Tar Heels a 69-66 lead with 1:46 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Bucknall, who was six for six at the foul line, and King Rice each added four 
free throws in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
Duke's Danny Ferry, who was held to 14 points, attempted a 70-foot desperation 
heave at the buzzer that would have tied it, but it bounced off the rim. 
</P>
<P>
Of Bucknall, North Carolina Coach Dean Smith said: "His play down the stretch 
was just sensational. He was a leader out there when we needed one." 
</P>
<P>
Bucknall said: "I just didn't want to go through what we went through last year 
when we all cried in the locker room after losing." 
</P>
<P>
J.R. Reid, the tournament's MVP, led North Carolina with 14 points. Jeff Lebo 
had 13, Kevin Madden 12 and Rick Fox and Scott Williams 11 each. Phil Henderson 
had 16 points for Duke. 
</P>
<P>
Big East 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown 88, Syracuse 79 -- Alonzo Mourning scored 21 points and the No. 3 
Hoyas won their sixth Big East Conference championship by beating the No. 5 
Orangemen at New York. 
</P>
<P>
The Hoyas (26-4) won three tournament games by an average of 20.6 points and 
were seeded No. 1 in the East Regional. The Hoyas have been in the NCAA 
tournament every year since the Big East was formed 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Big East championship was the sixth in as many appearances in the final for 
Georgetown. Five times the loser was Syracuse, which has lost seven of its last 
eight meetings with the Hoyas. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown led Sunday's game by as many as 23, but the Orangemen (27-7) were 
able to make the final score respectable with an 18-4 streak in the final 2:33. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown senior guard Charles Smith, the conference's player of the year, was 
named the tournament MVP after scoring 16 points Sunday to go with 24- and 
26-point performances in the first two games. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Thompson led Syracuse with 19 points. Mark Tillmon had 17 points for 
Georgetown and Jaren Jackson added 13. 
</P>
<P>
Metro 
</P>
<P>
Louisville 87, Florida St. 80 -- Pervis Ellison scored 22 points as the 
16th-ranked Cardinals beat the No. 14 Seminoles at Columbia, S.C., to win their 
second straight Metro Conference tournament title. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville (22-8) led by 14 in the second half, but the Seminoles rallied to 
cut the margin to three with 1:35 left on a three-point play by Derrick 
Mitchell. However, Ellison and LaBradford Smith each hit two free throws in the 
final 37 seconds to clinch the win. 
</P>
<P>
The title was the third in four years for the Cardinals. Florida State (22-7), 
which won the Metro regular-season title, has been to the tournament final five 
times but has never won. 
</P>
<P>
SEC 
</P>
<P>
Alabama 72, Florida 60 -- Keith Askins scored 14 of his 23 points in a 
second-half span of 2:14 to break open a close game at Knoxville, Tenn., and 
lead the Crimson Tide to the Southeastern Conference tournament championship. 
</P>
<P>
Askins' run came on four consecutive three-point baskets, and he turned two of 
them into four-point plays as the Tide went from a 35-34 lead to a 49-38 margin 
the Gators were never able to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
Askins started his run with a with 15:50 left. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth victory in a row and the seventh in eight games for Alabama 
(23-7). 
</P>
<P>
Florida (21-12), the regular season SEC champion for the first time in the 
league's 57-year history, lost for only the second time in 12 games. 
</P>

NEWSWIRE: TAC BOARD APPROVES RANDOM DRUG TESTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a unanimous vote by its board of directors, The Athletics Congress approved 
a year-round, out-of-competition drug testing program Sunday at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
TAC, the national governing body for track and field, previously tested only at 
competitions. Beginning July 1, the top 25 U.S. athletes in each event will be 
subject to testing any time during the year. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, it's been a long uphill battle," said Edwin Moses, two-time Olympic 
gold medalist and world record-holder in the men's 400-meter intermediate 
hurdles, one of the main architects of the 23-page TAC Drugfree Year Round Drug 
Testing Protocol that was presented to the board. 
</P>
<P>
"For six or seven years, I've had the feeling that random testing was the only 
way to do it." 
</P>
<P>
The randomness will be determined by computer, said Moses, chairman of a newly 
created Drug-Testing Oversight Committee. 
</P>
<P>
TAC president Frank Greenberg said the program "may well be a model for other 
sports organizations. This should dispel all rumors of cover-ups once and for 
all." 
</P>
<P>
To help implement the program, the board of directors will review a plan to 
hire an independent audit firm to monitor the disposition of each drug test. 
</P>
<P>
The board also upheld, by a vote of 67-4, a ruling by a special three-man panel 
to suspend 16 athletes and coaches who participated in a tour of South Africa, 
a country banned by the International Amateur Athletics Federation because of 
its policy of racial separation.

SOME BUSINESSES FACE PROBLEMS AS NORDHOFF ST. STRAIGHTENS OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that construction has started on a long-awaited $4-million project 
eliminating a jog in Nordhoff Street near Northridge Fashion Center, Tony 
Roma's restaurant and other small businesses nearby are having problems. 
</P>
<P>
Customers are complaining about a shortage of parking spaces in an area that 
has been fenced off for construction work. At Tony Roma's, managers Jeff 
Compton and Lisa Weiss ended up posting two diagrams of the Nordhoff Street 
expansion to answer customers' questions. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of weeks ago somebody drove into the fence in frustration," Weiss 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the travails of the small businesses adjacent to the project, city 
officials say the frustration of many motorists will be lessened by the 
Nordhoff Street connection. It is expected to carry 35,000 car-trips a day when 
it is completed in the middle of next year. 
</P>
<P>
Nordhoff Street now is fractured at Corbin Avenue, so motorists driving along 
Nordhoff must pass through two intersections instead of one. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Longstanding Plans 
</P>
<P>
Since 1972, the city has wanted to convert Nordhoff Street into one 
thoroughfare by building a bridge over the Southern Pacific railroad line and 
Limekiln Creek. The plan languished because of lack of funds until 1986, when 
the owners of Northridge Fashion Center agreed to pay $1.5 million of the cost 
in exchange for the approval of an expansion of the mall. 
</P>
<P>
The project "will be an important contribution to relieving east-west traffic," 
said Ralph Crouch, an aide to City Councilman Hal Bernson, who engineered the 
agreement with U.K. Northridge, the company that owns the mall. 
</P>
<P>
The mall's expansion from 1.2 million square feet to 1.5 million square feet 
includes the addition of a Robinson's department store, which opened last 
September, and a May Co. store, which is to open in August. Mall operators have 
scheduled a grand opening Wednesday for about 40 new specialty stores. 
</P>
<P>
The connection of Nordhoff Street also should relieve traffic on Plummer Street 
north of the mall and Parthenia Street to the south, said Ralph Valenzuela, a 
deputy city engineer. Some drivers use those streets now to avoid congestion on 
Nordhoff Street, he said. 
</P>
<P>
U.K. Northridge thinks the road connector will compensate for the added traffic 
attributable to the mall expansion, said Paul Wilson, a vice president of 
Richard Ellis Inc., which manages the mall. 
</P>
<P>
The city's original estimate for the cost of the project was $6.2 million. But 
bids came in lower than expected, and Security Paving Co. of Sun Valley was 
hired for the job at $4 million. The city's share of the cost is being paid 
with funds from the federal gas tax. Construction started last November. 
</P>
<P>
When the Los Angeles City Council approved funding the project with the mall's 
contribution in 1986, City Councilwoman Joy Picus criticized it as a "big 
favor" for the mall. She said it was too small and would siphon funds from 
other projects. Crouch, the aide to Bernson, who represents the area, 
attributed the criticism to "sour grapes" in that the Nordhoff Street project 
took priority over other council members' pet projects. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traffic Lights 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the bridge over the creek and railroad tracks, the project 
includes traffic lights for the intersection of the new portion of Nordhoff 
Street and the old, at a point just south of the Northridge mall. Eastbound 
traffic on the new part of Nordhoff Street will be able to turn west onto the 
old part, which is expected to be renamed Nordhoff Place, said Jim Glasgow, a 
city civil engineer. 
</P>
<P>
The new intersection also will include a driveway providing access for 
eastbound cars to businesses east of the bridge, such as Levitz Furniture Corp. 
and Best Products Co. But to get to businesses west of the project, like Tony 
Roma's and Breuner's Furniture Rental, eastbound cars will have to turn left 
onto Nordhoff Place and then left again into the commercial area. 
</P>
<P>
For Tony Roma's, that means a more circuitous route for customers and a 
lessened likelihood of people seeing the restaurant and stopping, Compton said. 
Nonetheless, the restaurant hopes to stay open and plans to increase its 
delivery business, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't fight City Hall," said Cindi Thompson, manager of Breuner's. 
</P>
<P>
Especially not in this case, noted Valenzuela, the deputy city engineer. The 
city has held the rights to build the road connection through the commercial 
area for about 20 years, he said.

ONCE THE BANE OF FARMERS, CROWS ARE STREET-WISE SURVIVORS IN URBAN 'FORESTS'; 
</P>
<P>
FLOCKING TO THE CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eleven-year-old Paula Everett didn't intend to ruffle any feathers when she 
picked up a fledgling crow that had fallen out of its nest and began carrying 
it home to her mother, who nurses injured birds in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But a flock of protective adult crows grabbed rocks from the gravel roof of a 
house and began dropping the stones on the girl's head. "Mom, the crows are 
throwing rocks at me," she complained when she ran into the house, her mother, 
Judy Everett, recalled. 
</P>
<P>
The avian assault illustrates a fact of modern life in America's large cities. 
Big, black, loud, mischievous and intelligent, crows are everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
The birds were once dynamited out of their roosts by the thousands. Now crows 
and their relatives are prospering as the uninvited guests of their historic 
enemy, man. 
</P>
<P>
While they haven't yet become the national bird of suburbia, crows seem 
ubiquitous in the unnatural "forests" around Los Angeles and other big cities, 
where they have developed a taste for McDonald's french fries, birthday cake 
and cat food. 
</P>
<P>
The crow population in California is growing a brisk 4% a year, according to 
the federal Breeding Bird Survey. Once shy of man, there are now thousands of 
crows in residential areas of the San Fernando Valley, Orange County, and the 
San Gabriel Valley, according to expert estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Crows can be seen rummaging through garbage bins after a party at Encino Park 
and begging for handouts at the golf courses in the Sepulveda Dam Recreation 
Area. Hundreds of the birds gather in a Van Nuys school complex in the 
evenings. 
</P>
<P>
Ravens, larger cousins of the crow and once thought to be in decline, are 
reproducing so rapidly in Southern California that biologists want to poison or 
shoot them to save the desert tortoise. Audubon Society volunteers counted 293 
ravens, once a rare sight, in the Malibu area in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"The population is exploding. It's kind of like Bangladesh," said Dan Taylor, 
western regional representative for the National Audubon Society in Sacramento. 
Actually, while both species are increasing, California's crow population is 
growing a third faster than the human population in Bangladesh. 
</P>
<P>
Daryl Brun of Blue Diamond Growers in Sacramento said nut growers look forward 
to the arrival of crows at certain times of the year because they clean the 
trees of "mummies," worthless fruit that stays on the trees over the winter. 
But the crow population is accelerating so fast in the San Joaquin Valley -- 
13% a year -- that farmers are beginning to complain, according to Cosmo 
Insalaco, the Fresno County agricultural commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
"There'll be some requests for action" against the birds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The population boom parallels a growing appreciation of crows and ravens as 
eggheads of the feathered world. They learn faster than some monkeys and are 
able to use tools. An instructor at UC Davis published a paper several years 
ago in which he suggested that campus crows were purposely dropping walnuts on 
the road in front of cars, inventing the world's first gasoline-powered 
nutcrackers. 
</P>
<P>
A behavioral ecologist at UCLA who has observed 40 families of tagged birds in 
the San Fernando Valley for four years thinks she has seen even more complex 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
"They have definite personalities, and they also have friends, and that's 
unheard of outside primates," said Carolee Caffrey, who is working toward a 
doctorate in crow behavior. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Large, Rural Flocks 
</P>
<P>
Once upon a time, the shaggy-headed ravens were seen infrequently, picking over 
animal carcasses on the desert or in the mountains. Crows were found out in the 
country, harassing farmers, though often in big numbers. A flock estimated as 
big as 1 million destroyed a promising almond industry in Klickitat County, 
Wash., in 1926. 
</P>
<P>
Such attacks made man declare war on the birds. Communities began dynamiting 
the huge Midwestern roosts at night. In Illinois 40 years ago, 328,000 crows 
were killed before a flock abandoned the rural roost. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Drennan, editor of American Birds magazine, said crows migrated to cities 
after World War II. Bird experts suggest that laws against shooting guns within 
city limits may have contributed to the movement. Then in 1972, Mexico insisted 
that crows and their relatives in the corvid family be added to the list of 
species protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which made the city streets 
safer than ever for the birds. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the messages we're getting is that crows are increasingly becoming 
birds of suburban and urban areas," said Charles Smith, director of Special 
Projects for the Laboratory of Ornithology at Cornell University in Ithaca, 
N.Y. "There are plenty of scraps for them from human activities, whether it's 
from the local McDonald's or the bakery." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Knight, an assistant professor at Colorado State University, found in 
1985 that when he approached the nests of urban crows they simply sat there 
watching. Rural crows always took wing. Knight concluded, "Our results suggest 
that recent colonization of cities by nesting crows may be in part a response 
to different levels of persecution in urban and rural areas." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bird Census 
</P>
<P>
The most reliable indicator of bird trends is the Breeding Bird Survey of the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, a census taken since 1965 in 25-mile corridors 
throughout the nation. The survey indicates that California's crow population 
has grown rapidly as suburbs expanded and new urban "woodlands" were created. 
</P>
<P>
"In Irvine we've gone from no crows" to the point where they are "one of our 
most common birds," said H. Lee Jones, a member of the federal survey team in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The Audubon Society's annual Christmas Bird Count has tallied crows, ravens and 
other species around Los Angeles for several decades. While some experts 
caution that it is subject to wide fluctuations based on the number of 
volunteers used and other things, the Audubon Society says the survey can 
reflect bird population trends. The Christmas Bird Count since 1946 in coastal 
Orange County, which has seen a tremendous growth in human habitation, shows a 
steadily upward trend among crows. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cycles of Growth 
</P>
<P>
The San Fernando Valley counts vary widely, showing an increasing trend from 
the first bird count in 1958 to 1970, then a falling trend to 1980, followed by 
a growing trend again. The counts are conducted around Hansen Dam, Encino 
Reservoir and other bird gathering places. But it doesn't focus on residential 
neighborhoods, where the population is thought to be thriving. 
</P>
<P>
"My own opinion is there are many, many more" crows in the San Fernando Valley 
today, said Irene Langton, treasurer of the local Audubon group, who 
participated in the first Valley bird count. "There are crows around the homes 
where there never used to be," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty thousand crows now gather in one roost on Long Island, N.Y. Ten thousand 
make their home in a park adjacent to downtown Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Once it was assumed that a large black bird in an urban area was a crow. "But 
now you can't say that any more, because ravens are moving in," said Kristin 
Berry, a wildlife biologist for the Bureau of Land Management. They can now be 
seen nesting on buildings in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aiming at Ravens 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. raven population has grown 3% yearly for two decades. Ravens are 
becoming so numerous that wildlife officials have drafted a proposal calling 
for poisoning and, perhaps, shooting hundreds of them in the Mojave Desert to 
save the desert tortoise, which is proposed for federal protection as an 
endangered species. The shells of 250 young tortoises have been found around 
the nest of just one pair of ravens. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts fear the population explosion will damage other bird species. 
"It's going to go very hard on the songbirds," whose nests are raided by crows, 
said Lloyd Kiff, curator of Ornithology at the L.A. County Museum of Natural 
History. 
</P>
<P>
Other experts, however, said they have seen no evidence that urban crows are 
driving out other birds. 
</P>
<P>
The crow is monogamous, mating for life. It also seems to take family 
responsibilities seriously. Young adult members of a family often help out at 
the nest after new birds are hatched. In suburbia, they nest at the tops of 
tall trees, raiding everything from trash to nuts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enjoying a Joke 
</P>
<P>
Those who enjoy them claim they have mischievous personalities. 
</P>
<P>
Caffrey said she has watched crows bedevil one another in play. A San Fernando 
Valley crow, whom she named Sned, was on the ground looking for food when a 
crow tagged as Skid flew to a tree and accidentally dislodged flower petals, 
which floated down and startled the foraging crow. 
</P>
<P>
When Sned returned to eating, Skid walked out to the flower, tore off a petal, 
leaned forward, and dropped it next to the bird on the ground. Once again, Sned 
was startled, jumped away, and looked up at Skid. Caffrey said the prank was 
repeated once more before Sned finally walked away.

"Not only do they play, but they have a sense of humor," said Caffrey. "That 
bird could anticipate the consequences of its behavior and was deriving 
pleasure from it." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Rosa of Encino rescued a crow last year that had fallen out of a nest, 
and raised it in the laundry room of his home. A stickler for authenticity, 
Rosa dressed in dark clothes, wore a watch cap on his head and squawked when he 
entered the room to feed the bird. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like an idiot, of course," said Rosa. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tame, Bold 
</P>
<P>
Eventually released by Rosa, the bird visited the Sepulveda Garden Center at 
Hayvenhurst and Magnolia, several blocks away. "He was real friendly," said Ron 
Miller, the chief gardener. 
</P>
<P>
The bird also was rash, eating food out of the dish reserved for Brad, the 
garden center's cat. 
</P>
<P>
Some people invest the birds with an almost mystical wisdom. As a young man, 
Santa Monica's mayor, Dennis Zane, was hanging clothes on a clothesline when a 
crow flew up. The bird took the cigarette from his mouth and spat it out. The 
future politician took it as a sign to stop smoking, so he said he cut down to 
a pack a day. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is charmed. Marge Fox of Burbank said the chattering in the trees 
"can be annoying. It keeps on until you think, 'enough already.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looks Belie Brains 
</P>
<P>
Bird intelligence is a subject of debate. The fact that a meadowlark will 
attack a stuffed rival placed in its territory doesn't do much for its 
reputation. But Jones believes that "we don't give birds enough credit," in 
part because "they don't look very much like us." 
</P>
<P>
Recent studies are challenging assumptions that birds are simple creatures. A 
study of crow vocalization at the University of Maryland showed that the simple 
"caw" is used in a variety of ways to signal alert, approaching danger, alarm 
and all clear. Different social groups have different songs, and when new 
members join the group, the song changes. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to complex behavior, "we're finding out that we as humans don't 
have a corner on the market," said Cornell's Smith, who kept a pet crow as a 
child in Tennessee. It bowed its head to be petted and had a fondness for 
Coca-Cola and Old Crow whiskey. 
</P>
<P>
Knight said crows often outscore dogs on learning tests. They also have the 
largest volume of corpus striatum, the material in the brain thought to be the 
seat of intelligence for birds, of any bird yet measured. Humans might have a 
lot higher opinion of bird intelligence if the first work on birds had been 
done on crows instead of pigeons, Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Persistence Needed 
</P>
<P>
Caffrey's doctoral work has included four years of researching birds living at 
the Sepulveda Basin in Van Nuys. When she began, she was told that crows are 
too wary for the detailed field study she was pursuing. "I'm sort of 
hard-headed," she said, so she went ahead. 
</P>
<P>
She began trapping the birds with a catapult net. The birds soon recognized her 
and her car and sent up their alarms even before she reached the golf course 
where she works. So she put on a Barbra Streisand wig, mustaches and glasses. 
She also drove friends' cars when she trapped. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have a high tolerance for frustration," she said. But she says her 
work has paid off with a rare look into crow society. 
</P>
<P>
She has found that the birds allow other pairs to move into an area already 
being shared by several families. "I don't see any dominance at all," she said. 
"They don't fight." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Distinct Characters 
</P>
<P>
The birds have individual personalities, she said. Al, who lives on the 14th 
tee, takes handouts from golfers at the recreation area. Some crows appear to 
have friends in other crow families. "Among neighbors, some are together a lot, 
more than would be expected by random selection," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always possible this is a highly inbred population," Caffrey said. But 
"what I see is a non-aggressive social structure." 
</P>
<P>
As she writes up her results, Caffrey is planning a new study of evening 
roosting behavior, which some ornithologists speculate might be social 
gatherings where single birds find mates, or for mutual defense. As many as 
1,000 birds roost in trees on Balboa Boulevard in Van Nuys, where the campuses 
of three schools merge. "The trees are black with them sometimes," said Elaine 
Hanley, who lives nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"I love these birds, and I'll never be able to walk away from them," said 
Caffrey, whose license plate reads Crowbiz. "I'd be the Jane Goodall of crows."

ELECTRICAL BLAST CAUSES FIRE, POWER OUTAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An electrical explosion early Sunday at College of the Canyons sparked a fire 
and left the campus without power, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
An electrical vault south of the Valencia college's campus services building 
blew up at about 2:30 a.m., propelling a concrete vault cover about 100 feet in 
the air, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Ron Boudreaux. 
</P>
<P>
The campus services building sustained about $10,000 worth of damage from the 
resulting fire, Boudreaux said. Electricians were working to restore power to 
the campus late Sunday.

Not selected as one of the 48 teams in the NCAA tournament, the San Diego State 
women's basketball team was chosen Sunday as the No. 1-seeded team in the 21st 
annual eight-team women's National Invitational Tournament in Amarillo, Tex., 
March 23-25. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought perhaps that we should have been one of the teams in the NCAA, but 
the committee didn't feel that way," SDSU Coach Earnest Riggins said. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that we're a better team than we showed in the last six or seven 
ballgames. Certainly, our overall record (23-8) was good enough but losing five 
of our last seven hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs will take on eighth-seeded Radford (23-6) at 1 p.m. March 21 in the 
first round of the single-elimination tournament. The top-seeded team has been 
defeated in the first round three consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
DePaul (22-8), the fourth-seeded team, is the first defending champion to play 
in the tournament in 16 years. JIM LINDGREN The San Diego County boys' and 
girls' high school basketball all-star games will be played at Serra High April 
8. The boys' game at 7:30 p.m. will feature the Class 3-A, coached by 
Sweetwater's Dave Ybarra, against the 2-A, to be coached by Kearny's Bill 
Petersen. The county girls' team, coached by Vista's Joe DeMaria, will take on 
the city girls' team with Mission Bay's Larry Willis as coach. Teams will be 
selected later this week.BASEBALL San Diego State managed just two ninth-inning 
runs as the Aztecs lost, 7-2, to Pepperdine in a nonconference game at Smith 
Field. Danny Brown went two for three and Anthony Johnson two for five with an 
RBI for SDSU (11-8), which had only six hits. Pepperdine (12-8-1) jumped to a 
4-0 lead in the first inning and added a run in the fourth and two in the 
seventh off six Aztec pitchers.SOFTBALL U.S. International University split 1-0 
games in a home doubleheader with UC Santa Barbara. The Gauchos (9-9) scored in 
the first inning of the first game. USIU (12-7-1) scored in the first inning in 
the second. The Gulls' Nora Flores (5-3) pitched her third shutout of the 
season in the second game.MEN'S TENNIS San Diego State (5-10 overall, 2-1 in 
the Western Athletic Conference) swept the singles and won two of three doubles 
matches in defeating New Mexico, 8-1, at SDSU. In No. 1 and No. 2 singles, Tole 
Marincovic (6-4, 1-6, 7-5) and Joe McDonough (1-6, 6-3, 7-6) won in close 
matches.WOMEN'S TENNIS San Diego State defeated Princeton, 9-0, in a 
nonconference match at SDSU. Sondra Mitchell, Kristin Hill and Dorey Brandt won 
their matches. No. 18 SDSU improved to 6-5. The University of San Diego swept 
all six singles matches and defeated Alabama, 7-2, in a nonconference match at 
USD. Toreras Jennifer Larking, Aby Brayton, Tonya Fuller, Sakolwan Kacharoen, 
Christine Schmeidel and Christy Drage won their singles matches. USD is 11-4. 
MEN'S CREW A good showing against UC Santa Barbara on Mission Bay gives the 
young UC San Diego team confidence going into the San Diego Crew Classic April 
1-2. UCSD defeated the Gauchos in novice lightweight and novice B boat. The 
Tritons also defeated Santa Barbara Community College in men's varsity fours. 
Santa Barbara defeated the Tritons in men's varsity lightweight and novice 
heavyweight.MEN'S GOLF The University of San Diego, UC San Diego and U.S. 
International University will compete against seven other schools in the 
36-hole USD Invitational today (11 a.m.) and Tuesday (7 a.m.) at the Carmel 
Mountain Ranch Golf Club.

MAXICARE HURT OWN FHS UNIT, CRITICS CONTEND; 
</P>
<P>
FIRM DENIES IT'S AT FAULT FOR DEMISE OF OPERATION THAT IT PURCHASED IN '86 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Maxicare Health Plans Inc. bought a lot of trouble when it acquired HealthCare 
USA in 1986. But there was one piece of gold in the package: HealthCare USA's 
Orange-based Family Health Services Inc., known in some areas as General Med, 
was making money. Today, Maxicare is dismantling the unit, leaving in its wake 
bitter employees, many of whom claim that Maxicare is largely responsible for 
FHS' demise. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a classic example of the ills of corporate medicine," said Dr. David 
Garcia, an internal medicine specialist who is among about 500 FHS employees 
losing their jobs. "There was a systematic strangulation of General Med. 
Maxicare would compete with us directly for the same corporate clients and 
undercut our bids." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based Maxicare, citing losses at FHS of about $1 million a month, 
said last week that it had no choice but to shut down the unit. Its 15 clinics, 
operated in the Southland under the FHS and General Med names, will quit seeing 
patients on March 31. 
</P>
<P>
For many FHS employees, it has been a swift and bewildering fall from grace. 
HealthCare USA was in such poor shape when Maxicare bought it in 1986 that one 
analyst would later say the expensive purchase -- along with another 
acquisition completed at about the same time -- "might now be charitably 
classified as junk." 
</P>
<P>
While HealthCare USA overall was reporting losses, FHS made close to $5 million 
in profit and served about 117,000 members. The unit also made money in 1984 
and 1985, according to reports filed with the California Department of 
Corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia and other employees said Maxicare erred in not making a better effort to 
retain key managers who were instrumental in the unit's success over the years. 
The unit's president, its senior vice president of operations and its two top 
marketing managers left to take jobs at other HMOs. Maxicare also failed to 
adequately support the unit's marketing staff, they claimed. 
</P>
<P>
"The marketing organization was in competition with Maxicare Southern 
California," said another employee who has worked at FHS for 15 years. "When we 
needed support, we got statements that we were never profitable. That's not 
true. Essentially, we became profitable in the early 1980s, when we passed 
35,000 members," the employee said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doesn't Own Hospitals 
</P>
<P>
Staff members were left in the dark about what was happening to the company, 
Garcia said, yet they had to face the repercussions of FHS' bills not being 
paid by its corporate parent. 
</P>
<P>
"Pomona Valley Hospital, which we had been using for a long time, kicked us out 
because of a $5-million bill," he said, explaining that FHS physicians 
constantly heard complaints from doctors who provided FHS with specialty 
services on a contract basis. "We would see them every day because we had the 
same patients. They would always tell us that they hadn't been paid for six to 
eight months." 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, Maxicare plans don't provide services directly but contract with 
independent hospitals and physicians to provide treatment for its members. The 
FHS and General Med clinics have staff physicians, nurses and support staff, 
but the unit doesn't own hospitals and has to use independent physicians in 
areas where it doesn't have specialists. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare, which overall has suffered heavy losses in the past two years, admits 
that its financial problems have prevented it from making timely payments to 
providers. However, the company says improving the payment schedule is its 
major priority. 
</P>
<P>
When first asked about the FHS employees' complaints, Tobi Nyberg, Maxicare's 
vice president for corporate communications, insisted that the unit was not 
profitable when Maxicare acquired HealthCare USA. "The company was not 
profitable. The enrollment was higher, but it was a troubled health plan," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about state records that show FHS' history of profitability, she 
said she wouldn't argue with the public record. Instead she presented a list of 
factors that she said were responsible for the unit's swift decline. Those 
factors were beyond Maxicare's control, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Maxicare is proud of its employees. (Closing FHS) was not something we wanted 
to do. We did everything we could to sell it. No one wanted to cause 
disruptions. No one wanted to go out of business," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to employee criticisms, Nyberg said the former top managers of FHS 
left on their own accord. She denied that Maxicare failed to support FHS' 
marketing efforts. The question of whether FHS was in competition with other 
Maxicare plans is irrelevant, she said, because it was always in competition 
with Maxicare and other plans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contracting Costs Rose 
</P>
<P>
Nyberg said FHS suffered from the same problems that plagued all HMOs in recent 
years, mainly rapidly rising medical costs. "The whole HMO environment changed 
drastically in 1987. Health-care costs exploded," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
FHS was hit harder than some other HMOs for several reasons, she explained. As 
an HMO with its own staff, it "had a large number of fixed costs that couldn't 
be controlled." FHS had a number of contracts with independent providers 
mandating payment on a full "fee for service" basis, she said, while other HMOs 
pay independent contractors a flat monthly fee on a per-patient basis. As 
medical cost escalated, FHS was caught with ever rising contracting costs, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A "significant portion" of FHS' membership were Medi-Cal patients, Nyberg 
added. But FHS began to lose money on those patients because the state premium 
payments for Medi-Cal patients increased only 1% to 2% a year, while the HMO's 
cost were increasing 10% to 12% a year. 
</P>
<P>
FHS recognized that its premiums were too low and raised rates, she said, but 
at the same time the membership declined. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Selwitz, an analyst with Cruttenden &amp; Co., a Newport Beach investment 
banking company, said in an environment of rising health-care costs, "staff 
model" HMOs like FHS have generally fared better than HMOs that contract for 
all medical services. Staff model HMOs, for example, have had better control 
over such factors as the cost of physician services, he said. Fountain 
Valley-based FHP Corp., a staff model HMO unrelated to FHS or Maxicare, "had a 
little bit of a setback in 1986. But they've been very strong since," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Selwitz said he would have expected FHS to do better, although it was 
disadvantaged by the fact that it didn't own hospitals and charged low rates 
when costs started rising rapidly. "My suspicion is that, with all of the 
problems Maxicare had with the other HealthCare USA plans, it just didn't pay 
enough attention to FHS. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (FHS) just got lost in the shuffle."

A SHORT IN ELECTRONICS MARKET; 
</P>
<P>
FEDERATED IS THE LATEST TO TRIP UP, AS RETAILERS ARE FINDING THEY HAVE NO HOT 
GADGETS TO LURE CONSUMERS INTO STORES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Flashy new products can quickly become old hat in the consumer electronics 
business. One day everyone needs a videocassette recorder, and the next 
everyone already has one. 
</P>
<P>
"The major problem for the industry today is that there are no new hot products 
to replace what the VCR did for the industry from 1977 to 1985," said Martin 
Brochstein, editor of Consumer Electronics Monthly, a trade publication based 
in New York. "There is no 'gotta have' product that everyone needs to rush to a 
store to get. And the industry needs one to get going." 
</P>
<P>
That is especially true for consumer electronics retailers in such areas as 
Southern California, where heated competition has led to sharp discounting and 
promotions that squeeze profit margins. Retailers that are slow to recognize 
new trends often fall by the wayside. 
</P>
<P>
The latest company to learn about the pitfalls of the business firsthand is 
Federated Group, a retail chain founded 19 years ago in West Los Angeles that 
dominated the Southern California market as recently as the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Atari Corp., which bought Federated Group in August, 1987, for $67.3 million, 
announced Thursday that it hopes to sell the chain, possibly through a 
leveraged buyout. Atari said Federated, which has 60 stores in California, 
Texas and Arizona, chalked up losses of $124 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts have faulted Atari for failing to improve Federated's marketing or to 
expand its product selection beyond electronics goods, such as TVs, VCRs, CD 
players, and home and car stereo equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Einola Matinkhou, president of Adray's, a Van Nuys-based competitor, said 
Federated "expanded the number of stores too fast without expanding their 
product selection." 
</P>
<P>
Although consumers apparently still love their VCRs, more than 60% of American 
homes already have the devices, according to the Electronic Industries Assn., 
and such products as car phones and video camcorders haven't demonstrated broad 
appeal. Even compact disc players haven't achieved widespread popularity. The 
association says that less than 15% of U.S. households have them. 
</P>
<P>
The dearth of popular new gadgets has come as competition in the consumer 
electronics retailing business is intensifying. Last week, for instance, Sears, 
Roebuck &amp; Co., the world's largest retailer, introduced a discount strategy 
and cut prices on 50,000 items, including consumer electronics products. 
</P>
<P>
"With the entry of Sears we are going to see a lot more retailers -- 
particularly weak chains like Federated and mom and pop stores -- fall by the 
wayside," said Linda R. Morris, an analyst at Provident National Bank in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Federated once reigned almost unchallenged in Southern California -- days when 
it had a reputation for running self-indulgent, eccentric commercials. A 
television spot that ran in the early 1980s, depicting a Federated spokesman 
shouting out special sales while battling hordes of rubber frogs, was 
characterized as "undeniably tasteless" by Adweek magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The company has been more subdued, however, since the arrival of its Richmond, 
Va.,-based discount competitor, Circuit City. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Helped by Wide Variety 
</P>
<P>
Backed by a $10-million television advertsing campaign that emphasized service 
and convenience as well as price, Circuit City quickly drew the attention of 
Southern Californians in 1986 when it began opening a string of 22 
supermarket-size stores displaying everything from washers to compact disc 
players. Some Circuit City outlets even had child-care facilities for shoppers 
who wanted to browse without being distracted. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the sheer variety of products at Circuit City and smaller competitors 
such as Adray's appears to be a big reason they have thrived at a time when 
Federated struggled.

Federated, for example, has never carried appliances such as dishwashers and 
refrigerators. And the chain's marketing efforts left a lot to be desired, 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"Circuit City had dramatically better execution than Federated," said Eliot 
Laurence, an analyst at the Minneapolis investment house Wessels, Arnold &amp; 
Henderson. "Circuit City did a much better job of advertising and marketing, 
offering appliances as well as CD players. Federated never got their act 
together." 
</P>
<P>
Circuit City says it expects to report, for the fiscal year that ended Feb. 28, 
record sales of $1.7 billion, up 27% from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Federated, however, is hardly the only consumer electronics retailer with a big 
presence in California to get ambushed by fast-shifting consumer preferences 
and competition. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Stereo, an Emeryville, Calif., company that had 64 operating stores in 
1985, shut down a little more than two years ago. Industry observers at the 
time said the chain waited too long to supplement its selection of audio 
equipment with video products. Around the same time, First Family Group, a 
major specialty retailer of home appliances and consumer electronics, closed 
its 13 Golden Bear Home &amp; Sport Centers in Southern California after the 
chain's president complained of the intense price competition here.

State Sues Over TWA Ads: The state of California has charged Trans World 
Airlines with deceptive advertising. The complaint alleges that TWA advertised 
in newspapers and other media a low one-way fare to London, although in fact 
the fare could be obtained only by buying a round-trip ticket. State Atty. Gen. 
John Van de Kamp issued a statement saying that the suit -- in San Diego County 
Superior Court -- would bar the airline from further unfair advertising and 
assess civil penalties.

Illinois Central Accepts Bid: Illinois Central Transportation Co., the owner of 
the Illinois Central Railroad, has accepted a $436-million takeover bid from 
the Prospect Group, creator of a railroad in Mississippi three years ago, the 
companies announced. The announcement came six weeks after the New York-based 
conglomerate launched the unsolicited $20-a-share cash takeover offer for 
Illinois Central, a major carrier of freight between Chicago and the Gulf of 
Mexico. The railroad originally gave a neutral reaction to the bid from 
Prospect Group, which owns MidSouth Corp., a regional railroad based in 
Jackson, Miss.

STUDY CREDITS CALIFORNIA WITH 11% OF U.S. EXPORTS IN 1988 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY YOSHIHARA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California manufacturers and farmers produced $34.7 billion, or 11%, of all 
U.S. exports in 1988, according to a forthcoming report that breaks down trade 
data by state for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, exports originating in California totaled $27.8 billion and generated 
about 233,000 jobs directly related to the export business, according to the 
report by the California Department of Commerce. Trade specialists, however, 
challenged the statistics, saying that they were too conservative. 
</P>
<P>
Employment figures for 1988 are not available yet. 
</P>
<P>
The trade figures were based on reports compiled by the Bureau of Census, which 
in 1987 required shippers for the first time to file state of origin 
information on export declaration forms. 
</P>
<P>
"We never before had a good measure of what we produced here for trade," 
explained Stephen Levy, senior economist at Center for the Continuing Study of 
the California Economy in Palo Alto. "We only had port data of what got shipped 
out of here." 
</P>
<P>
The port data was based on all goods passing through U.S. Customs at ports and 
airports in the state. That information did not differentiate place of origin, 
so it included goods produced outside California but shipped through the state 
overseas. In 1987, $38.9 billion of goods were shipped through California ports 
and airports. 
</P>
<P>
"It is true, and perhaps confusing, that the amount of stuff actually made in 
California is less than what is shipped out of the ports because we ship things 
out from other states," Levy said. He cautioned that the new export figures 
should not be compared to the port figures: "It's not lower or higher, but a 
different measure." 
</P>
<P>
But at least one specialist said Commerce's reading of the data was too 
simplistic and understated the volume of goods and jobs generated from 
California exports. 
</P>
<P>
Jock O'Connell, who runs his own trade and foreign investment consulting firm 
in Davis, said 30% of 1987's $253 billion in total U.S. exports did not have a 
state of origin listed. Either the information was not supplied by shippers 
because of security restrictions or their forms could not be read. 
</P>
<P>
Had the state "refined its reporting system" on the Census data, according to 
O'Connell, several billions worth of exports and jobs would have been added. 
"They've missed an opportunity to lay claim to several billion dollars worth of 
exports," he said. 
</P>
<P>
T. Anthony Quinn, director of the Commerce Department's Office of Economic 
Research, said his office decided to take a conservative approach to the Census 
data. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the 233,000 jobs directly created by exports, an additional 96,000 
people were employed in handling imports. Other jobs indirectly related to 
trade brought total trade employment to 935,000 in 1987.

ANARCHY IN A CAN; 
</P>
<P>
TRUE, ONLY A FRACTION OF THE SPRAY PAINT MADE EACH YEAR ENDS UP AS GRAFFITI. 
BUT THE NEVER- ENDING CLEANUP OF THE DAMAGE COSTS MILLIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Miguel Angel Gonzales, a home boy from San Pedro, says he favors Korbel brandy, 
small caliber revolvers and almost any brand of spray paint, so long as it is 
blue. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old member of the West Side Wilmas, a gang whose color is blue, is 
better known on the streets as "dopey," a signature adorning walls in the 
harbor area for the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
Dopey would often go through several cans of spray paint a night, "kicking back 
with the home boys," he recalled in a recent interview at the county jail. He 
was busted on vandalism charges when he was caught scrawling over a rival 
gang's graffiti and sentenced earlier this month to 130 days. 
</P>
<P>
Such stiff penalties are rare, however, in society's losing battle against 
graffiti. As gang activity has soared in Southern California, graffiti has 
become a social scourge. At the same time, it has fueled multimillion-dollar 
sales in spray paint, as well as a rapidly growing industry to clean up the 
mess. 
</P>
<P>
Spray paint sales in the United States exceed half a billion dollars, although 
experts disagree over how much spray paint is used for graffiti, as opposed to 
painting back yard grills, sprucing up children's bicycles and other household 
tasks. 
</P>
<P>
The spray paint industry is composed of about a dozen U.S. producers that 
annually turn out 300 million cans, according to the National Paint &amp; 
Coatings Assn. That's more than one can for every man, woman and child in the 
nation every year. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think one one-hundredth of 1% of spray paint is used for graffiti," 
said Hugh Young, the paint association's director of state and public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
But graffiti experts such has Jay Beswick, a consultant and adviser to a number 
of gang counseling service groups, sharply disputes that assessment. "I think a 
substantial amount is used (for graffiti)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Beswick observed, 153 cans of spray paint were used to paint just 
a single graffiti mural on a sound barrier wall on the San Bernardino Freeway. 
"You can count them at the bottom of the wall, because they don't haul them 
away when they're finished," he said wryly. 
</P>
<P>
"Graffiti is an industry," he added. "We are talking big bucks." 
</P>
<P>
In the Southland, 150 companies are in the business of removing graffiti. And 
75 paint manufacturers around the country make anti-graffiti coatings. 
</P>
<P>
The public cost of removing graffiti is staggering. Government agencies in Los 
Angeles County alone spend $50 million annually in graffiti removal. By 
comparison, the nonprofit Braille Institute spends about $12 million annually 
in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the money that government spends to combat graffiti is contracted out 
to private graffiti removal firms, utilizing such heavy equipment as 
sandblasters and water blasters. Technology is also helping as new coatings are 
created that allow graffiti to be washed off. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Bilinski, owner of Allied Cleaning Systems in Northridge, said the 
graffiti-removal industry has grown in recent years, but competition has become 
fierce. "I gross $45,000 per year, but it isn't easy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite massive government spending, many experts consider the fight a losing 
battle. The Rapid Transit District, for example, completely cleans graffiti off 
its buses each day, and each day fresh graffiti is painted on virtually every 
RTD bus. The annual cost of removal is $8.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
"It is tyranny," said Gordana Swanson, president of the RTD board. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-gang crusaders also worry that gang activity and graffiti occasionally 
take on an aura of social respectability. 
</P>
<P>
Target, a discount store chain owned by Dayton Hudson Corp., published a 
nationally distributed advertisement on Jan. 15 that depicted children in front 
of graffiti-colored walls. The kids, wearing fashionable pastel clothes on sale 
at Target that week, were posed holding cans of spray paint and marking pens. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a regrettable incident," said Ann Barkelew, a Dayton Hudson 
spokeswoman. "We heard from a lot of people . . . who said, 'What kind of 
company is this?' " 
</P>
<P>
Spray paint manufacturers plead that they are not at fault. "To do away with 
graffiti would do nothing but good for the industry," said Rick Birle, 
president of Carson-based Zynolyte Products, a major spray paint producer owned 
by Standard Brands. "If graffiti stopped nationally tomorrow, I don't thing I 
would notice any change in my sales." 
</P>
<P>
Zynolyte Vice President of sales Craig Gioia and Birle are both active in 
community organizations opposed to gangs. In addition, they note, Zynolyte 
contributes paint to groups that clean up graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent morning, the Zynolyte production line was humming, turning out 
thousands of cans of spray paint. A huge warehouse was filling up, in 
preparation for the heavy summer demand. 
</P>
<P>
As he looked on, Birle acknowledged: "You are almost afraid to tell people you 
are in this business. The first thing they think is gangs, graffiti, ozone 
depletion. PR-wise, the industry hasn't done a good job of stressing the 
positive aspects of the product." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, motorists traveling through Los Angeles are struck by the 
proliferation of graffiti. In some cases, Graffiti has entirely covered walls 
hundreds of feet long. After the graffiti has been removed, it quickly 
reappears. 
</P>
<P>
"A single can of black paint can go a long way," Birle asserted. 
</P>
<P>
Birle estimated that no more than 1% of spray paint sales go to graffiti use. 
Even at that estimate, about 3 million cans would be used annually to deface 
property, more than 8,000 cans daily. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, most spray paint is purchased for legitimate purposes. Birle said 
the product is easy to use and avoids the mess of a dirty paint brush. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such good intentions, some of the spray paint reaches juvenile vandals. 
Under California law, retailers are prohibited from selling spray paint to 
minors, but the law is not well-enforced. 
</P>
<P>
"They say you have to be 18, but nobody cares," said Gonzales, the gang member 
who is in jail. "When I was younger, I would just go into any store and buy 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, retailers say they are hard-pressed to enforce the law. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the projects and legitimate uses for spray paint are for minors," 
said Jack Edwards, president of home improvement chain Builders Emporium. "It 
is not practical to ask everybody buying a can of paint, 'What are you going to 
do with it?'

Dennis R. Patrick made a simple proposal nearly two years ago when he became 
chairman of the Federal Communications Commission: Let American Telephone &amp; 
Telegraph earn as much profit as it can but limit the annual increases in 
AT&amp;T's long-distance rates. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick said it was time to throw out the 20-year-old regulatory philosophy 
that had allowed AT&amp;T to earn a certain percentage above its proven costs 
-- a philosophy that Patrick maintained offered the utility no incentive to cut 
costs. Instead, he said, use price caps to reward efficiency and create 
economic incentives to lower costs. Doing so, he argued, will not only reward 
shareholders but also save consumers a bundle. 
</P>
<P>
Congress howled and consumer groups said it would lead to unrelieved price 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
But Patrick stood fast, fine-tuning the FCC plan to meet criticisms. And on 
Thursday, the commission is expected to approve implementation of the rate-cap 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Congress could still intervene and block rate caps, but Patrick said he 
considers the program one of his biggest accomplishments since becoming FCC 
chairman in April, 1987, succeeding Mark Fowler. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the rate cap proceedings . . . have been a model in terms of 
interaction between the commission and the Congress on an important issue of 
public policy," Patrick said in an interview last week. "I think there has 
developed a consensus that rate-of-return regulation is flawed and that we need 
to have incentive regulation. . . . I think we have a formula and a process 
that is going to cap rates and bring them down faster than what we should 
anticipate under rate-of-return regulation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Hot Issues 
</P>
<P>
The long-term benefits, he said, would give companies such as AT&amp;T and, 
eventually, the seven regional Bell companies, including Pacific Bell, "an 
incentive for the first time to reveal to the federal government how efficient 
they can be." 
</P>
<P>
Patrick, a 37-year-old California attorney, acknowledged that his 
administration has been marked by more than one contentious issue -- including 
abolishing the FCC's 40-year-old Fairness Doctrine, which required broadcasters 
to present opposing views of controversial issues. But he maintains that 
strained relations with some members of Congress have improved because of his 
willingness to communicate with Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
"Relations, in fact, I think are very good between the commission and the 
Congress," he claimed. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick was born in Glendale on June 1, 1951. Graduated with honors from nearby 
Occidental College with a bachelor's degree in political science, he went on to 
take a law degree in 1976 from UCLA. He then joined the politically 
well-connected Los Angeles law firm of Adams, Duque &amp; Hazeltine before 
going to the White House personnel office with the incoming Reagan 
Administration in December, 1981, where he worked on personnel selection. He 
was named an FCC commissioner in December 1983, advancing to chairman in 1987. 
His term ends on June 30, 1992, but he is expected to leave the $82,500-a-year 
post later this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's fair to say that 1992 will not see me in this position," he 
conceded, but added that he has no immediate plans to leave government.

JACK SMITH: REPUTED BIRD EXPERT HAS TO EAT CROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My fraudulent reputation as a bird expert brings many curious questions to my 
desk, almost none of which I can answer. 
</P>
<P>
A woman in the Valley once asked me to identify a large, glossy black bird that 
goes "caw," and I was able to inform her, with little doubt, that the bird she 
had in mind was a crow. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond such elementary conundrums as that, however, I am helpless. I don't know 
a warbler from a shrew. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Nancy White of Glendale seeks to exploit my imaginary expertise by asking 
me what I think of a new and frightening theory she heard described on the 
"Wink and Bill" talk show on KABC. 
</P>
<P>
She writes: "It seems there exists a Birdist Organization with a new theory on 
the Creation. They believe our Earth is actually an egg which was laid by a 
giant space bird, and for eons and eons the nucleus has been evolving into a 
baby space bird which will hatch imminently. 
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore, we humans, animals and plants are merely so many bacteria and 
fungi that appear microscopically on the surface of any ordinary egg. The deep 
interior rumblings and vibrations which the unenlightened refer to as 
'earthquakes' are, in fact, the efforts of the baby bird to burst out of its 
shell, and when this blessed event occurs, we bacteria will be hurled into 
outer space and oblivion." 
</P>
<P>
White wonders what truth I may assign to this theory. She herself is skeptical, 
evidently, because of her maternal instincts. "What kind of bird," she asks, 
would leave her young unattended for so long? Why is she not sitting on the 
nest? Could it be that some giant space cat may have devoured her?" 
</P>
<P>
I must disabuse White on that point. Many animals, including human beings, 
abandon their young; and if I were a cosmic bird, I certainly wouldn't want to 
sit on anything as volatile as the Earth. Also irreverent of the nesting 
instinct is the cuckoo bird, which is reputed to raid other birds' nests and 
eat their eggs. 
</P>
<P>
As for the credibility of the theory, I find it no harder to believe than the 
two predominant contemporary theories about the Earth's origin: one that it was 
created by God in six days and the other that it was formed from a disk of dust 
around the sun about 5 billion years ago. Both, if you ask me, are highly 
improbable. 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, the big bird theory seems no more plausible than the flat 
Earth theory espoused by members of the Flat Earth Society. I have talked to 
the head of this group and, as far as I can tell, he is dead serious. Flat 
Earthers ignore all the evidence that the Earth is a sphere, including the 
thrilling photographs made from spaceships, which they dismiss as hoaxes. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know what the Flat Earthers would say about the big bird theory, but I 
have an idea they would reject it, because an egg is somewhat round, though 
rather more ovate than the Earth itself. 
</P>
<P>
I suppose the theory is right, though, in supposing that we humans and all 
other life on the planet are hardly more than bacteria and fungi in the cosmic 
scheme. Certainly the two predominant contemporary theories contemplate an end 
to life on Earth -- a day of reckoning, so to speak -- and that fits the big 
bird theory that when the baby bird bursts out of its shell it will all be over 
for us bacteria on the surface of the shell. 
</P>
<P>
I think all these theories are only hysterical attempts by the bewildered to 
explain the world we live in. As Lewis Thomas says, it is inevitable that human 
beings, seeking to understand the cosmos, can only be dumbfounded. 
</P>
<P>
I have my own theory, that being my right. I think the Earth is driven by an 
internal combustion engine (probably Japanese), and that one of these days the 
fan belt is going to break and the engine will burn up. 
</P>
<P>
When that happens the Earth will stop rotating. One side will fry from constant 
exposure to the sun, and the other side will freeze. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, of course, if the big bird theory is right we may be eaten 
some day by a cosmic cuckoo bird. 
</P>
<P>
Makes as much sense as any other doomsday theory.

ARCHITECTURE: POST-MODERN CIVIC CENTER IS SOUL OF A CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Purple Post-Modern columns, topped by symbolic metal mesh pediments, frame the 
courtyard entries to South Pasadena's city hall, police station and council 
chamber. The latter, with its raftered wooden ceiling and subdued chapel-like 
gray and cream walls, seems crafted to cool the passions at town meetings. 
</P>
<P>
The chamber's soothing colors are especially appropriate, given South 
Pasadena's history. For 25 years, residents have fought the freeway and other 
encroachments into their 3.44-square-mile territory, sandwiched between 
affluent Pasadena and giant Los Angeles. And like most development issues in 
this small city of 25,000, the civic center proposal stirred vigorous debate. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, soon after the 1983 announcement that South Pasadena's run-down city 
hall would be replaced, residents and politicians began arguing about the 
proposed civic center's location. Two sites were favored. Mayor Ted Shaw 
supported an El Centro Avenue location, opposite the city's rebuilt 1930s 
public library; another faction advocated rebuilding and expanding the existing 
1950s city hall in the historic Mission Street district. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the voters decided on Mission Street and, four years later, the 
$3-million civic center was completed, encompassing a renovated city hall and 
new council chamber, police station and fire hall. 
</P>
<P>
The handsome Post-Modern complex derives its style from the traditional Spanish 
and Mission revival architecture of the city's historic Mission Street core. 
Scale is modest, a homage to the city's enduring small-town character, and 
buildings, both civic and commercial, are low-rise, low-key and friendly. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been easier to design a building that made a personal statement, 
but we wanted to create a civic architecture of quality that symbolized the 
low-key soul of the city," said architect Stefanos Polyzoides, a former South 
Pasadena resident who designed the center with partner Peter de Bretteville. 
"To make this happen we had to be subtle and discreet. We had to do an 
expressive design that fits in with its neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Midwestern Tone 
</P>
<P>
The shady streets surrounding the civic center recall another era, when 
Midwesterners flocked to the area to settle amid the orange groves. The modest 
bungalows they built in a hand-me-down Craftsman style still set the tone, and 
two churches dominate the center, reminders of the Fundamentalist faith of the 
city's founding fathers. 
</P>
<P>
In Polyzoides's view, South Pasadena still remains "the displaced Iowa town 
established by its Midwestern founders. Any attempt to make a heroic, 
overscaled architecture would (have been) totally out of the question," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The center has many civic virtues, among them the fact it fits neatly into the 
surroundings by aligning main frontages on Mission and Mound streets with the 
facades of the existing buildings. Two courtyards -- one public, the other 
internal -- link the various civic departments. A trio of portals on Mission 
lead to the public courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
"Our aim was to overlay the historic architectural style of the city with a 
contemporary gloss to create a continuity between then and now," de Bretteville 
said. "We wanted to lay out the civic center as if it were an old Spanish 
mission, like a complex of low, interlinked, red-tile-roofed buildings." 
</P>
<P>
The police station, located behind a bullet-proof window that seals off the 
interior from public access, is airy and unintimidating. Lit by clerestory 
windows, a double-height corridor floods the inner offices with sun and 
separates the holding cells and booking areas from the detectives' rooms. The 
corridor also opens onto an internal courtyard, linking the police station with 
the fire hall on Mound Street. 
</P>
<P>
"This building is a hundred times pleasanter to work in than the old police 
house," said Lt. Richard Kowaltchuk, a senior member of the 30-member South 
Pasadena Police Department. "We're really happy to be here." 
</P>
<P>
When on duty, members of the fire department live above the garage, and in an 
emergency, slide down stainless steel poles located on balconies at each end of 
the fire hall. At the rear, a tile-capped four-story training tower resembles 
the bell tower of a small Spanish pueblo. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager John Bernardi applauds the civic center design as "very 
functional, with good spaces and a nice style. People here aren't easy to 
please," he said. "They care a lot about their city, so it's quite an accolade 
when most comments I've heard about the new building are favorable, and even 
proud."

'RAIN MAN' A STEP CLOSER TO OSCAR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NINA J. EASTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Rain Man" continued its strong march toward the Academy Awards later this 
month when its director, Barry Levinson, collected the Directors Guild of 
America's top honor Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the guild award typically goes on to receive an Academy Award for 
best director. Only three directors have ever been passed over by the Academy 
of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences after receiving the guild's top award -- 
Steven Spielberg in 1975, Bob Fosse in 1972 and Anthony Harvey in 1968. The 
historical odds are similarly high that the academy will tap Levinson's film 
for best picture. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief acceptance speech, Levinson dwelt not on those odds, but on the 
twists of fortune that brought "Rain Man" to him after it passed through the 
hands of three other directors. "To have started out just reading the script 
and passing on advice to some of the people involved and suddenly ending up 
with the movie in my lap, and suddenly to be up here one year later," Levinson 
said, catching his breath. "Oh, my. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
In the television categories, a critically acclaimed show with one of the 
lowest ratings in prime time -- ABC's "thirtysomething" -- collected the 
guild's award for best direction of a nighttime dramatic series. Marshall 
Herskovitz, a repeat winner, took home the award for his searing portrayal of a 
marital breakup between two of the show's main characters. He was chosen over 
his colleague, Edward Zwick, who had been nominated for another episode of 
"thirtysomething," and Mark C. Tinker, nominated for his direction of the last 
episode of NBC's "St. Elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Miner received the top honor in the TV comedy series category for his 
direction of "The Wonder Years" pilot on ABC. The other nominees were Ellen 
Falcon for the "Roseanne" pilot on ABC and Barnet Kellman for the "Murphy 
Brown" pilot on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
In the dramatic specials category, Lamont Johnson was honored for his direction 
of NBC's "Lincoln" over Dan Curtis ("War and Remembrance" on ABC) and Rod 
Holcomb (the "China Beach" pilot, also on ABC). "I received one of these 
(awards) for 'Profiles in Courage,' " Johnson said. "I'm sure glad you still 
remember the name." 
</P>
<P>
Levinson's competitors in the DGA's feature film category were Charles Crichton 
for "A Fish Called Wanda," Mike Nichols for "Working Girl," Alan Parker for 
"Mississippi Burning," and Robert Zemeckis for "Who Framed Roger Rabbit." 
</P>
<P>
The hit of the awards dinner at the Beverly Hilton was Crichton, 78-year-old 
director of "A Fish Called Wanda," whose nomination had been the guild's only 
surprise in the feature film category. When Levinson was introduced to the 
"Wanda" director, Crichton yelled at his competitor: "Stand back, or I'll hit 
you with my stick!" 
</P>
<P>
At the podium, where each of the feature film nominees was honored, Crichton -- 
cane in hand, his arms flying -- cheerfully berated his "Wanda" colleagues. 
"The trouble with that comedy was trying to work with people like (writer-star) 
John Cleese, whose . . . tortuous cruelty is the total opposite of anything 
that's funny. Then, when you're trying to direct people like Kevin Kline, whose 
always wondering if the camera is in the right place, or Jamie Lee (Curtis) 
who's always changing the damn dialogue. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Michael Palin did do something rather marvelous actually," Crichton continued. 
"He created a new chapter in the history of drama in his performance with the 
chips up his nose. Honestly, it was astonishing." 
</P>
<P>
In between one-liners and a Las Vegas-style performance by singer Rita Moreno, 
master of ceremonies Carl Reiner offered two serious reform suggestions for 
Oscar season, both of which received strong support from the audience. "I have 
in my house more color reproductions of Sigourney Weaver and a beautiful 
gorilla than I need," Reiner said. "I get one every day. At first I thought 
Sigourney thought I was attractive. We've got to tell the academy to stop this 
advertising. I'm getting turned off on the pictures I like." 
</P>
<P>
Reiner also proposed that all award givers -- including the academy -- 
eliminate the practice of choosing one winner from a field of just five 
nominees. "Why not seven, nine, twelve, whatever pictures deserve it?" Reiner 
asked. "There are some pictures this year that should be up there. What 
happened to 'Dominick and Eugene'?" 
</P>
<P>
Others honored by the directors guild Saturday night included: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sidney Lumet, who was named an honorary life member of the guild, joining 
the ranks of Hollywood figures like D. W. Griffith, Frank Capra, Walt Disney, 
Charles Chaplin and Elia Kazan. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jesus Salvador Trevino, who won in the daytime dramatic TV show category 
for his direction of "Gangs," a CBS Schoolbreak Special. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Walter C. Miller, winner in the TV musical/variety category for his 
direction of the Irving Berlin 100th Birthday Celebration on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Merrill Brockway, winner in the TV documentary/actuality category for PBS' 
"On the Move." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Harry Coyle, winner in the sports category for his direction of last year's 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 -- James Gartner, winner in the TV commercial category.

A MUSEUM GROWS IN WESTWOOD; 
</P>
<P>
OTHER PRIVATE MUSEUMS: A REPORT ON ART HOUSES COLLECTORS HAVE BUILT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
"Another boutique museum," indignant art reporters scoffed last year when 
Armand Hammer announced a plan to build a private museum for his art collection 
instead of giving it to the County Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
Newsworthy as Hammer's decision was, the move was also part of an international 
trend toward private museums -- and away from supporting public institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Advertising magnates Charles and Doris Saatchi have a private showcase in 
London, and German chocolate king Peter Ludwig presides over the Ludwig Museum 
in Cologne. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, Dominique de Menil, whose family made a fortune from 
Schlumberger oil-field services, in 1987 launched the Menil Collection in 
Houston; Washington collectors Wilhemina and Wallace Holladay in 1981 
established the National Museum of Women in the Arts at the nation's capital; 
Illinois manufacturer Daniel Terra, who formerly had a museum in Evanston, in 
1987 opened the Terra Museum of American Art in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Not far behind, Southern California had a short but weighty list of wealthy 
collectors who had plans -- or rumored plans -- for private art museums at the 
time of Hammer's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
On the top of the list, retired industrialist Norton Simon had announced an 
"agreement in principle" to give his stellar collection of predominantly 
European and Asian art to UCLA. In return, the university was to maintain his 
present museum in Pasadena and build a new museum on or near the Westwood 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
Frederick R. Weisman, chief of Mid-Atlantic Toyota, had hoped to house his 
foundation's collection of contemporary art at Greystone Mansion in Beverly 
Hills, but those plans fell through late in 1986. In the wake of that 
disappointment, he was examining other options -- including UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Eli Broad, head of Kaufman and Broad, a housing and financial services company, 
was renovating a building in Santa Monica for his rapidly growing collection of 
vanguard contemporary art. 
</P>
<P>
Developer Edward Broida, who had scrapped plans for opening a private museum in 
New York, was rumored to be considering a Los Angeles showcase. 
</P>
<P>
(In addition, television producer Douglas Cramer had installed a first-rate 
collection of contemporary art in his Santa Ynez Valley ranch home in what some 
observers thought was a suspiciously museum-like setting, but Cramer recently 
emphasized that he does not have a museum and has "no aspirations for one.") 
</P>
<P>
What has happened to all those projects during the last year? Only one of them, 
the Eli Broad Family Foundation's new home, has come to fruition. And, 
according to Broad, the foundation is not a museum but a lending library and 
study center. 
</P>
<P>
The strictly private facility, which loans works of art to museums and 
university galleries and admits scholars by appointment, opened early last 
December in a former telephone switching station at 3355 Barnard Way. Broad 
told The Times at the opening that he did not intend the Santa Monica facility 
to be a permanent monument and that he would eventually give his collection to 
one or more museums. 
</P>
<P>
Simon's resignation from his museum last week revived speculation about the 
fate of his collection, but sources close to the museum indicate that, for the 
present, operations will continue as usual under the direction of Simon's wife, 
actress Jennifer Jones Simon. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations with UCLA reportedly fell through on June 3, 1987, only four 
months after the university announced Simon's plans for his collection, but the 
breakdown wasn't confirmed until a year later. 
</P>
<P>
In a surprising move last summer, Simon loaned large displays of contemporary 
art to the County Museum of Art and the Museum of Contemporary Art. That 
development suggested that Simon might donate his contemporary art (which he 
acquired when he took over the Pasadena Museum of Modern Art), but officials 
from all three institutions have declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Weisman has stopped searching for a home for his foundation collection, 
according to publicist Robin Green. The foundation's focus and budget have 
shifted from buildings to "scholarly projects," Green said. An official 
announcement of the Weisman foundation's new direction and program plans may 
come in a month. 
</P>
<P>
"Art and Architecture," the first in a projected series of Weisman-sponsored 
workshops, was held Jan. 21-22 in a Santa Monica hotel. A concurrent UCLA 
exhibition of the Weisman foundation collection renewed speculation that the 
works might end up at the university, but foundation spokesmen firmly deny that 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
Broida could not be reached for comment, but an associate said he has no plans 
for a museum in Los Angeles.SUZANNE MUCHNIC

A MUSEUM GROWS IN WESTWOOD; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET GROWS TO $50 MILLION AS PLANS EXPAND FOR ARMAND HAMMER PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Ensconced on the 16th floor of the Occidental Petroleum Center building in 
Westwood, Armand Hammer is master of all he surveys: his corporate 
headquarters, an art collection that he values at $400 million and a massive 
hole in the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer's oil empire has brought him wealth and power, his collection has 
allowed him to become a self-styled cultural diplomat, but if all goes 
according to plan, the hole in the ground and the building above may change all 
that. 
</P>
<P>
The excavation -- stretching from Westwood Boulevard to Glendon Avenue and from 
Lindbrook Drive to the back of the Occidental high-rise -- is the site of the 
future Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center. As the permanent home 
of Hammer's art collection, the projected institution is the 90-year-old 
industrialist's key to a kind of immortality. 
</P>
<P>
Phrases such as "at my death" and "while I'm living" now creep into the 
conversation of the man who has long presented the appearance of someone who 
intended to live forever. Increasingly conscious of his waning years, he now 
seems determined to build a permanent reminder of his accomplishments. He says 
he plans to give an unforgettable gift to the people of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer was stung by criticism of his decision, announced Jan. 21, 1988, to 
build his own museum instead of honoring his oft-repeated promise to give his 
collection to the County Museum of Art. But that's behind him, and he has a 
band of supporters among Westwood business leaders and property owners. They 
have welcomed the planned museum as an opportunity to upgrade Westwood Village, 
an area that has changed from a suburban neighborhood and university shopping 
center to a jumble of fast-food shops and movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Friends of Westwood and the Holmby Westwood Property Owners 
Assn. envision the museum as a grand "gateway" to the village, according to 
Jackie Freed, a director of both neighborhood groups. The most inspired 
enthusiasts say the cultural institution will be "the jewel of Westwood," a 
notion that Hammer embraces with satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
What was once a relatively modest plan for a multimillionaire collector's 
private cache has evolved into a more ambitious strategy that is 
public-oriented and financially enterprising. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want a sleepy little museum" but an institution that will play a 
vital part in "the dynamism of the community," said Hilary Gibson, a consultant 
to Hammer on the museum's development. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, nearly everything except the general plan of the 
77,000-square-foot building, designed by New York architect Edward Larrabee 
Barnes, and the projected completion date, in the fall of 1990, has changed: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The budget has grown from $30 million to $50 million, Hammer said in an 
interview in his office. The increase was required to remove an unexpected 
second foundation that lay beneath the former parking garage and Chevron 
service station and to pay for extensive remodeling on the Occidental Center 
building, the first four floors of which will be incorporated into the museum. 
</P>
<P>
The new structure will cost $22 million -- $16 million for galleries, $4 
million for an auditorium and $2 million for furnishings. The remaining $28 
million will go to remodeling the 30-year-old former Kirkeby Building, which 
will house the museum's restaurant and a bookshop at Wilshire and Westwood 
boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hammer's estimate of the value of his collection has escalated from $250 
million to $400 million since he announced his museum plans. He bases the 
estimate in part on "Hospital at Saint-Remy," a late Van Gogh painting in his 
collection. Van Gogh's "Irises" commanded $53.9 million at auction "and those 
irises grew in that garden," he noted, waving in the direction of his 
landscape. "Some people say I could get $150 million for it." 
</P>
<P>
 -- In addition to permanent displays of Hammer's three-part collection -- Old 
Master and Impressionist paintings, more than 10,000 lithographs and other 
works by 19th-Century French satirist Honore Daumier, and the "Codex Hammer," 
an 18-page scientific manuscript by Leonardo da Vinci -- the museum will have a 
program of changing exhibitions on loan from other institutions. This program 
will include works from the Soviet Union's major museums. "The Soviet Minister 
of Culture has told me I can have anything I want," Hammer said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- New acquisitions will continue to expand the collection. During the past 
year, Hammer has purchased prints and drawings by Daumier, George Bellows and 
Jean Louis Andre Theodore Gericault, paintings by Eric Sloane, Daniel Ridgeway 
Knight and C. S. Pearce and an 18th-Century tapestry depicting America, made at 
the Russian Imperial Tapestry Manufactory, according to Alla T. Hall, director 
of the museum. 
</P>
<P>
He also has bought five works by Russian painters, including Ilya Repin. "Every 
Russian painting that comes on the market, I'm a customer for," Hammer said, 
noting that he intends to build a collection of pre-revolutionary Russian art. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The display of pages from the "Codex Hammer" will be enhanced by a Leonardo 
study center, which will have an office for Leonardo scholar Carlo Pedretti and 
a working relationship with UCLA's Belt Library. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 235-seat auditorium originally planned for visual arts lectures has 
ballooned into a performing arts center, designed for a full range of programs 
from poetry readings to concerts and plays. The stage will have a wood dance 
floor; the auditorium will be equipped with acoustically adjustable walls and 
devices for translating four languages at once. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Docent tours, already established at Occidental's headquarters where 
Hammer's paintings are on display, will grow into a full-fledged education 
program designed to enhance exhibitions and bring schoolchildren to the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The museum's restaurant will not be an ordinary coffee shop but a 
Daumier-themed eatery, a sort of "French bistro with a California spirit," 
according to Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Most important to the longevity of the museum is an entirely new financial 
plan. Details are still being worked out, Hammer said, but he roughed out the 
general concept: "Occidental will provide sufficient funding so that the museum 
can operate for the first six years without incurring any deficit" and continue 
support, in decreasing amounts, for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
The museum will receive $5 million from Occidental for each of the first two 
years, $4 million annually for the next two years, $3 million a year for the 
next two years and $2.5 million for each of the remaining 24 years. After 30 
years, the museum will have an option to purchase the Occidental Petroleum 
Center and thus earn income from rental of the upper floors, as does the Museum 
of Modern Art in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
The museum will be a "self-supporting, independent corporation," Hammer said. 
Additional income will be generated by admission fees, bookstore sales, rental 
of the auditorium and fund-raising campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
"The museum will be well funded," Hammer said. "When I die, there is no 
question about continuity." He said that he has signed an "irrevocable 
contract" to give his collections to the museum corporation at his death. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer has also set up a board of trustees, dominated by five people who have 
no connections with Occidental: Neil Chur of Park Associates in New York; 
Arnold Fisher, Fisher Brothers in New York; Don Jones, Star Cable Vision Group, 
Fon du Lac, Wis.; Alan Kirshner, Market Services, Glen Allen, Va., and Donald 
Smith, Devcon International, Deerfield Beach, Fla. The nine-member board will 
include four insiders: Hammer; his grandson, Michael Hammer; Ray Irani, 
president of Occidental; Alec Courtelis, who manages Hammer's Arabian horses. 
</P>
<P>
After announcing his plans, Hammer and his advisers have quietly worked out 
public relations and bureaucratic procedures. The museum's environmental impact 
study has been approved, Hammer said. Neighborhood groups had worried that the 
museum might bring additional traffic and parking problems to the congested 
area. They wanted to prohibit left turns onto Wilshire Boulevard, a plan that 
has been adopted, Hammer said. The parking lot will more than double the number 
of spaces formerly available, increasing from 250 to 670. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer desires nothing less than "to create one of the finest small museums in 
the country" and that vision has evolved dramatically over the past 14 months. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I was upset that I couldn't go ahead with my original intent to give 
my collection to the County Museum of Art," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But now I'm so happy to have a free hand while I'm alive" and to be directly 
involved in all aspects of the museum, Hammer said. "There's not a meeting we 
have that I don't attend." Among items on his agenda is a plan for "an opening 
that will be sensational." 
</P>
<P>
Any hints? 
</P>
<P>
"No, but I can assure you it will be a blockbuster," he said.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Farm Workers 
</P>
<P>
The English and civics requirements of Phase 2 do not apply to those who 
received temporary residency under the special farm workers program. 
</P>
<P>
These people should apply for permanent residence, but the requirements and 
deadlines are different than those for other amnesty applicants. 
</P>
<P>
Those in the Group 1 category, who proved they have worked in agriculture a 
minimum of 90 days in 1984, 1985 and 1986, could become permanent residents as 
of Dec. 1, 1989. Those in Group 2, who proved they worked a minimum of 90 days 
in agriculture between May 1, 1985, and May 1, 1986, could become permanent 
residents beginning Dec. 1, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Green Card 
</P>
<P>
The card for permanent residence -- the "green card" as it is commonly known or 
Form I-551 as it is officially known -- is proof of legal permanent residency 
in this country. With it, one is eligible to work in this country, and it is 
possible to enter and leave the country with very few restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Loss of Card 
</P>
<P>
In the case of loss or theft of the permanent residence card or if the 
applicant changes his or her name, a new card can be requested by filling out 
and presenting form I-90 to the Immigration and Nationalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
Change of Address 
</P>
<P>
INS officials have urged applicants who have moved since applying for amnesty 
to fill out a change of address form, available at legalization offices. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving the Country 
</P>
<P>
If the permanent resident needs to leave the country for more than one year, he 
must request permission from the INS before departing. A number of conditions 
must be met for the INS to grant such permission. There are no restrictions on 
permanent residents leaving the country for shorter periods. 
</P>
<P>
The Family 
</P>
<P>
If a minor received a permanent residency card when he was younger than 14, the 
family should request a new card when the child turns 14. This can be done by 
filing form I-90. 
</P>
<P>
Someone who has been granted permanent residence may then apply to have their 
spouse or unmarried children considered for legal status. This request should 
be made in Form I-130. 
</P>
<P>
Immigration officials in Los Angeles say families in such situations will not 
be broken up while these applications are being considered -- which in some 
cases can take many years. 
</P>
<P>
These cases come under a section of law in which each country is assigned an 
annual quota of 20,000 such applications. Some countries quickly fill their 
quota because of the large number of applications. Then, a waiting list is 
formed. In the case of Mexico, for example, the wait is a number of years. 
Applications are weighed under a system of pre-established preferences. First 
preference is given to the parents of U.S. citizens, followed by the parents of 
legal residents. 
</P>
<P>
Public Benefits 
</P>
<P>
The 1986 immigration law specifies that newly legalized temporary residents 
will not be eligible for federal public assistance for a period of five years 
after obtaining legal status, with the exception of certain medical services, 
including emergency medical aid, aid to the elderly, sightless or handicapped, 
or in case of serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
The INS has stated that it will consider aliens receiving public assistance in 
cash as a public burden, and thus ineligible for legalization, although certain 
exceptions may be made. A temporary resident who faces an extreme situation 
should consult with a community legal aid organization before applying for this 
type of assistance. 
</P>
<P>
However, if necessary, temporary residents can freely and without fear of 
hindering their prospects for legalization apply for food stamps, housing 
assistance, medical attention, Medi-Cal, unemployment insurance, workers' 
compensation and Social Security disability insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Temporary residents can also enroll their children in Head Start school 
programs and obtain assistance for vocational occupation and on-the-job 
training. University students can also apply for certain types of federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
People with doubts about their eligibility for some particular type of 
government assistance should consult with a nonprofit agency that offers legal 
assistance. Some of these groups are listed on Page 15.

QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Marita Hernandez, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new immigration law was a careful compromise, and as such it has many 
complicated provisions. Those who are now going through the second phase of the 
amnesty program may understandably be somewhat confused. To help clear up any 
misunderstandings about the program, Times staff writer Marita Hernandez posed 
the following questions to William King, INS regional director for immigration 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
Question: If I have my temporary residence card, is that good enough to stay in 
the United States legally? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: No. Once you achieve temporary residence, you have an 18-month period 
of temporary status and then you have a one-year window following that in which 
to qualify for permanent residence. Somebody who applied in May of 1988, for 
instance, would be eligible to apply for permanent residence in November of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
We're very, very much concerned about people getting their applications in on 
time. We don't want them to revert to an illegal status, and that would happen 
if they don't meet these Phase 2 requirements. You should be planning to file 
immediately when you become eligible. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Let's say that I received my temporary residence card more than a year ago, 
but I've heard nothing from INS since. What should I do? 
</P>
<P>
A: You should go to the (INS) Legalization Office where you filed your 
application and make an inquiry. They can call you up on their computer system 
and they should be able to give you a response right there. You should be able 
to get a status report as to where you stand with respect to your application 
and your status. 
</P>
<P>
Q: At what point would you advise applicants to check with their Legalization 
Office? 
</P>
<P>
A: Everybody who has qualified for temporary residence should receive in the 
mail a manual -- a temporary residence guide to applying for permanent 
residence -- 60 days before they are eligible to apply for permanent residence. 
These things are automatically mailed to their last address. (If not) you can 
pick up application forms at any Legalization Office. We'll be making them 
available to community groups as well. 
</P>
<P>
It's very, very important that they tell us when they move. Applicants should 
submit a change of address report to us whenever they move because if we can't 
find them, they could be out of luck. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What about applicants who have only their work permit and haven't even been 
called in by INS for their temporary residence interview? What should they do? 
</P>
<P>
A: In all cases, they should by now have been assigned an interview date. They 
should wait for that interview. (If not) they should go to their nearest 
Legalization Office and fill out a change of address card and we'll take it 
from there. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Meanwhile, how can an applicant begin preparing to fulfill the requirements 
necessary to file an application for permanent residence? 
</P>
<P>
A: The principal concern is that they either meet the educational requirement 
or that they fall under one of the many exemptions that are open to them. The 
documentation requirement is minimal. We're going to depend mainly on the 
documentation submitted in the first phase. 
</P>
<P>
Q: In what cases might additional documentation be necessary? 
</P>
<P>
A: The area we're concentrating on is absences from the United States. 
Applicants would need something to show the beginning and end of their trip 
outside the country, such as rent receipts, airplane or bus tickets, showing 
that they weren't out for more than 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Let's say I overstayed the 30-day limit on a single absence outside the 
country, or exceeded the total 90-day limit. Do I have any recourse? 
</P>
<P>
A: If it was for an emergency circumstance, you're not going to have any 
problem. Other situations would be handled on a case-by-case basis. But there 
are ways around it, depending on the circumstances and reasons for the absence. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How do you fulfill the requirement that calls for economic self-sufficiency? 
Do you have to prove once again, as was required in Phase 1, that you will not 
become a public charge? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. You don't have to do anything to further prove that you will not become 
a public charge. You would not have received temporary residence had you not 
been able to satisfy the public charge test. If you submitted a public charge 
waiver in Phase 1, however, then you may be required to show that you have 
remained free of public assistance and are self-sustaining. But Phase 2 
interviews are a lot less intensive than Phase 1. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is an HIV medical test for AIDS required? 
</P>
<P>
A: If you didn't have an HIV test when you submitted you medical exam during 
Phase 1, then you need to have the test done now. As of Dec. 1, 1987, people 
were required to file the test result with their medical exam. Anyone who filed 
before that date, however, was not required to file the HIV test result and, 
therefore, would be required to submit it when they file their Phase 2 
application. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What happens if the AIDS test result is positive? 
</P>
<P>
A: There is a waiver available. The fact that somebody tests positive doesn't 
necessarily mean they are going to be excluded from achieving permanent 
residence. Waiver forms are available at the Legalization Offices. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do I have to pay back taxes in order to apply for permanent residence? 
</P>
<P>
A: Not as far as we're concerned. There is no requirement that applicants show 
any evidence that back taxes have been paid. It's not a condition of Phase 2 
permanent residence. The IRS (Internal Revenue Service) may require them to 
look at paying back taxes, but that's the IRS, not us. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What if my wife or kids did not qualify for amnesty? 
</P>
<P>
A: It would have to be reviewed and would be handled on a case-by-case basis. 
Basically, if a family doesn't qualify, there's not that much that can be done 
to give them permanent residence. There's no way for us to unilaterally grant 
them permanent residence. There may be a means of granting extended voluntary 
departure so that families are not split up until their cases can be resolved 
by other means. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What options are available to people who did not qualify for amnesty? 
</P>
<P>
A: If you were issued a denial by the (INS) Regional Processing Facility, the 
first step is an appeal to the Legalization Appeals Unit in Washington. Their 
decision is final, there is no other appeal. 
</P>
<P>
If an immediate family member does not qualify for amnesty, you can petition 
for them to immigrate. Permanent residents can petition for spouse and 
children. Five years down the road, once you become a citizen, you can petition 
for parents, brothers and sisters, married sons and daughters. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Since the permanent resident applications are all in English, who can help 
me fill one out if I don't speak the language? 
</P>
<P>
A: You can go to whomever helped you originally with your Phase 1 application. 
You can go to community-based organizations, qualified designated entities 
(QDEs) in good standing, the church in some instances, even friends. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What are my options for fulfilling the requirement for a basic knowledge of 
English, U.S. history and government? 
</P>
<P>
A: First, there are exemptions by virtue of age. If you're 65 or over, or under 
the age of 16, you are not required to fulfill the educational requirement. If 
you're 50 and have resided 20 years in the United States, you are also exempt. 
If you have attended one year at a state-accredited school you're exempt, or if 
you have a high school or (equivalent) diploma. 
</P>
<P>
We understand, by some estimates, that maybe 30% of the total pool of 
applicants will need to take the 60-hour course of instruction, or at least 40 
hours of it to complete what we call "successful pursuit." 
</P>
<P>
If a person has had no education, has only a minimal understanding and speaking 
ability with respect to the English language, then they're probably going to 
have to take that course. 
</P>
<P>
But if they have attended some school and they have survival skills in English, 
then I would recommend that they take an exam, which will exempt them from any 
further educational requirements for Phase 2 permanent residence. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What exams are available? 
</P>
<P>
A: There are basically two types of tests that can be taken. One is the 
"proficiency" examination; the other is called the standard 312 or citizenship 
exam, which also relieves you of any further testing when you petition for 
citizenship five years down the road. 
</P>
<P>
The citizenship test can be taken at the time of the INS interview. If you fail 
it, they'll reschedule you six months later for another test -- even if it's 
beyond your one-year window -- unless there's a mutual agreement between both 
parties for an earlier test date. You get only two tries. 
</P>
<P>
This test can also be taken through ETS (Educational Testing Service) prior to 
the interview. To take it, you have to call the NALEO (National Assn. of Latino 
Elected Officials) hot line -- (800) 346-2536 -- and make an appointment 
through them. 
</P>
<P>
The second test -- the proficiency exam -- we developed out of concern that 
there might not be enough classroom space for those applicants who really need 
it. We saw an opportunity to develop something slightly easier than the 
312-citizenship exam that would meet the requirements contained in the 60-hour 
course of instruction. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Where and how many times may I take the proficiency exam? 
</P>
<P>
A: You can take this test as often as you want. It is available by appointment 
at all Legalization Offices on Thursday nights and will be more widely 
available, after March 2, at other places, including QDEs and state Department 
of Education facilities willing to contract with INS to administer it. The test 
consists of 15 questions and you must get nine of them correct to pass. 
</P>
<P>
Those who take the proficiency exam will be required, five years down the road 
when they petition for citizenship, to take the standard citizenship test at 
that time. 
</P>
<P>
There is no need for people who can pass one of the tests to sit in that 
60-hour course. 
</P>
<P>
Q: If I want to take one of the tests without taking classes, how can I prepare 
myself? 
</P>
<P>
A: Pick up a copy of a list of 100 (citizenship exam) questions available at 
the Legalization Offices. If you memorize the answers, you will pass either the 
citizenship or proficiency test. The one thing that separates the proficiency 
test from the citizenship exam is that it covers a lot of life skill questions 
-- things you should have picked up just by living in the United States, like 
what you need to drive a car. 
</P>
<P>
We're also in the process of designing a study guide that we hope to have 
available by mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
The standard citizenship textbooks can be picked up at public libraries or 
purchased at the Government Printing Office. There are also videotapes 
available. One is being broadcast over KMEX. 
</P>
<P>
Q: If I choose to take the classes, how can I tell if a school is INS-approved 
to offer the required course? 
</P>
<P>
A: You can get a list of certified schools at the Legalization Offices or ask 
to see the school's I-804A certificate, signed by the INS Western Regional 
Commissioner Harold Ezell and Los Angeles District Director Ernest Gustafson. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Those who applied for amnesty under the Special Agricultural Workers program 
are exempted from taking classes or a test. How else does the amnesty process 
differ for them? 
</P>
<P>
A: None of these requirements apply to them. Once they've gone through one year 
to 18 months of temporary residence, approval for permanent residence is 
automatic. We'll have them come into a Legalization Office and get photographs 
and fingerprints and fill out a form so that we can mail them their card. There 
is no application and there is no fee. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Which benefits may temporary residents receive without jeopardizing their 
application for permanent residence? 
</P>
<P>
A: Anything that would result in the receipt of cash would be a problem, but 
will be handled on an individual basis. General welfare is the one that would 
give applicants the most trouble. There are some housing programs that result 
in public cash assistance that could be a problem. AFDC (Aid to Families with 
Dependent Children) is only a problem if it's the sole source of family income. 
U.S. citizen children are entitled to it and if the family has other income, it 
shouldn't be a problem. Medi-Cal, food stamps, student aid are not 
disqualifiers. We're frightened of people not getting necessary medical care 
because they're afraid it will disqualify them. 
</P>
<P>
What we fear most is people disqualifying themselves. If they have a question 
about the type of assistance that they've been receiving, let them come to the 
Legalization Office, let them go to some sort of legal aid assistance and work 
that out. Don't disqualify yourself, because if you've made it this far, the 
likelihood is very good that you're going to get through the rest of it.

FOR THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
In the "Staying Legal" supplement published March 13, The Times inadvertently 
omitted several programs from a list of government-approved schools for the 
amnesty program. They are: Chaffey Community College District, 5885 N. Haven 
Ave., Rancho Cucamonga 91701 (714-987-1737); English Training Schools Inc., 
14907 Vanowen St., Van Nuys, 91405 (818-782-2112); Tustin Unified School 
District, 300 South C. St., Tustin 92680 (714-730-7396) and Theatre of Arts, 
4128 Wilshire Blvd., L.A. 90010 (213-380-0511). 
</P>
<P>
The government has expanded the list of approved programs since the section was 
published and will continue to do so. Questions about whether an amnesty 
program has been approved can be directed to the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service at (800) 448-4994.

<P>
HOW TO APPEAL YOUR CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Has your application for legalization been denied? Don't give up hope. There is 
a good chance of winning your case on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The law recognizes your right to appeal an adverse judgment by the INS. But you 
have only 30 days from the denial of your application to file the appeal. You 
have the right to obtain a work permit for the duration of the appeals process. 
</P>
<P>
Reason for Denial 
</P>
<P>
The most common reasons for which the INS denies the applications for 
legalization are: 
</P>
<P>
* Lack of documentation. 
</P>
<P>
* Prolonged absence from the country -- more than 45 days at one time and/or 
more than 180 days since January, 1982, up to the date of the filing of the 
application. 
</P>
<P>
* Commission of criminal offenses. 
</P>
<P>
* False information in the application, in the filed documents or in the 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
Getting Help 
</P>
<P>
It is highly recommended that you seek the help of an attorney to make an 
appeal. At first glance the appeals process may appear to be simple, but it 
requires specialized legal work. After filing the appeal, a written legal 
argument and a series of proofs must be presented to the INS. Do not go to a 
notary public or a bogus "expert in legal matters." 
</P>
<P>
Some private agencies may also be able to help you file an appeal. Some may 
help you free of charge. In other cases, an appeal can cost hundreds of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The legal agency Public Counsel has information about attorneys and others who 
can handle your case. The telephone number is (213) 487-0910. 
</P>
<P>
Forms and Fee 
</P>
<P>
In case your 30-day limit is running out and you have not obtained an attorney, 
you can start the initial proceedings yourself. The appeal must be made by 
filing Form I-694. On the form, you can ask for more time to obtain legal 
assistance. But the government must receive the form by the 30th day. Either 
take the form and a $50 money order to an INS office or send it by certified 
mail to the following address:

EMBATTLED NAVAJO LEADER TRIES TO STRADDLE 2 WORLDS

WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Flung across the lunar edges of three states, the 25,000-square-mile Navajo 
reservation seems virtually unchanged from the days when it served as the 
eerily beautiful set for John Wayne movies. 
</P>
<P>
Although rich in minerals, the high desert provides barely a Third World 
existence for most of the 170,000 tribe members who live here and call what 
lies beyond reservation boundaries "the outside world." 
</P>
<P>
The contrasts can be striking. 
</P>
<P>
While many of his constituents go without adequate housing, plumbing, 
electricity or telephones, the Navajo leader, Peter MacDonald, enjoys a life 
style replete with private jets, posh offices, luxury cars and lavish parties. 
</P>
<P>
Some revere him. Others revile him. And the passions stirred by the enigmatic 
60-year-old chairman of the nation's largest Indian tribe often reflect his 
people as much as his politics. 
</P>
<P>
Now, amid allegations of corruption and fraud, MacDonald is waging an ugly 
battle to keep the powerful post he has claimed for 14 of the last 18 years. 
Under investigation by the U.S. Senate, a federal grand jury and his own tribe, 
MacDonald maintains he is the innocent victim of dirty politics and cultural 
ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
He describes himself as a "fearless, aggressive" leader and favors comparisons 
to Geronimo or Sitting Bull. 
</P>
<P>
Detractors call him "MacDollar" and liken him to less romantic figures -- 
Ferdinand E. Marcos, Jim Bakker and Moammar Kadafi, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
"Listen, this guy is the Navajo Huey Long," said Peterson Zah, a former tribal 
chairman and rival of MacDonald, referring to the legendary "Kingfish" of 
Louisiana politics. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, MacDonald had the locks changed on the tribal council 
building and legislative office here after dissident members of the tribal 
council elected an interim chairman, challenging MacDonald's rule. "We really 
have a police state here," Zah said Sunday, referring to MacDonald's order. 
</P>
<P>
The scandal and continuing tribal discord have nearly halted tribal government, 
periled Navajo business deals and divided a proud but impoverished Indian 
nation torn between tradition and progress. 
</P>
<P>
The damage to MacDonald lies not only in what is being said about him, but in 
who has been saying it: The most damaging evidence came from his only son and 
one of his oldest friends.

</P>
<P>
That testimony, before a Senate subcommittee investigating alleged corruption 
in Indian country, included secretly taped conversations with MacDonald which 
portrayed him as a greedy, corrupt politician who would scheme to bilk his own 
tribe and persuade his son to take the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Peter (Rocky) MacDonald Jr., 33, testifying under immunity and the apparent 
fear of losing his new place in the state bar, told Senate investigators his 
father solicited thousands of dollars -- and a new BMW -- in kickbacks and 
bribes from companies and individuals seeking to do business on the 
reservation. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest hurdle the chairman faces is explaining his role in the tribe's 
purchase of the Big Boquillas Ranch near the Grand Canyon, about 100 miles 
outside the reservation. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony alleged that MacDonald conspired with his old friend and golfing 
partner, Phoenix developer Byron (Bud) Brown, to buy the property at an 
inflated price and split the profit. 
</P>
<P>
The Navajos paid $33.4 million -- $68 an acre -- for land they didn't realize 
Brown had purchased from the California owners just six minutes earlier for 
$26.2 million. The property had been on the market for two years at $25 
million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reportedly Collected $50,000 
</P>
<P>
Brown told the Senate subcommittee that MacDonald was to get $500,000 to 
$750,000 in kickbacks but actually collected about $50,000 in $1,000 increments 
the two referred to under the code "golfballs." 
</P>
<P>
As chairman, MacDonald draws an annual salary of $55,000. He maintains homes in 
Flagstaff, Phoenix and Window Rock, and he sends his daughters to private 
school. 
</P>
<P>
The $700,000 remodeling of the chairman's wing at tribal headquarters reflects 
his taste. Mahogany doors carved with the Navajo seal were imported from the 
Philippines to the tune of $4,800. 
</P>
<P>
Described as a gifted orator in Navajo, MacDonald has been hopscotching the 
reservation lately to proclaim his innocence. He enjoys strong support among 
the elders. Many lack sufficient English to follow the news about their leader. 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald refuses, on advice of his lawyer, to discuss specific allegations, 
nor would he testify before the Senate subcommittee or cooperate with a former 
U.S. attorney the tribe hired to probe the Big Boquillas deal. 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald insists that accepting "gifts" is a respected part of his culture. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alleges Racism 
</P>
<P>
"There is a hidden agenda here," he said in a brief interview, suggesting that 
the federal government wants to undermine Indian leadership in a racist bid to 
regulate tribal business and challenge sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
He professes love for the son who betrayed him, saying: "Those folks made to 
testify did so under duress or some kind of threat." 
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Navajo Tribal Council before being placed on paid leave, 
MacDonald summed up his troubles with characteristic cool: 
</P>
<P>
"Every elected leader," he said, "goes through ups and downs of popularity." 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald is no stranger to the ups or the downs. 
</P>
<P>
Born on the reservation to a traditional family of sheep ranchers, MacDonald 
"didn't even see his first white" until the Bureau of Indian Affairs sent him 
away to school and gave him an Anglo name at the age of 6 or 7, according to 
his wife, Wanda. 
</P>
<P>
During World War II, MacDonald joined the Marine Corps at 15 by lying about his 
age, his wife recalled. The boy became one of the legendary Navajo 
"code-talkers" who outwitted the enemy by relaying sensitive military 
information in their indecipherable native tongue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trained as Medicine Man 
</P>
<P>
After two years in the Pacific, MacDonald came home and trained to be a 
medicine man before the "outside world" beckoned again. He earned a degree in 
electrical engineering from the University of Oklahoma and worked for Hughes 
Aircraft before accepting an invitation to work for the tribe. 
</P>
<P>
He divorced his first wife and married his secretary 26 years ago. MacDonald 
encouraged all five of his children to leave the reservation to get a decent 
education and work experience. 
</P>
<P>
By the time he won the coveted chairmanship for the first time in 1970, 
MacDonald, a Republican, was a firm advocate of economic development. If the 
Navajos were to survive, the "outside world" would have to come in. 
</P>
<P>
It would be a long haul. The vast reservation had gotten its first supermarket 
just a year earlier. The first small shopping center would take 16 years to 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
Today, while old women still peddle exquisite willow baskets and woven rugs, 
the tribe also dabbles in unconventional ventures, such as a shittake mushroom 
factory. There are even plans for a multimillion-dollar resort in cooperation 
with designer Oleg Cassini. 
</P>
<P>
But life on the reservation has not improved much. Per capita income is around 
40% of the national average. Luring business has proved difficult, in part, 
because basic services are so poor. There are nearly 8,200 miles of road, but 
nearly 6,000 are dirt or unimproved. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have often accused MacDonald of favoritism and featherbedding, but just 
how much can be attributed to culture and how much to cunning remains a topic 
of fierce debate. 
</P>
<P>
"MacDonald is a very traditional person," said Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, a 
Colorado Democrat and part Cheyenne who has known the Navajo leader for several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a strong traditional belief that you are obligated to take care of 
your family," Campbell said, "and if you are in a position of authority, that 
means giving jobs to relatives." 
</P>
<P>
"In the white world, that would be called nepotism, or cronyism. In the Indian 
world, you are expected to do that." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until MacDonald's second term that trouble really hit. 
</P>
<P>
Indicted in 1977 on fraud and tax evasion charges, MacDonald got off with the 
help of attorney F. Lee Bailey. The jury failed to reach a verdict and charges 
were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fosters National Image 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald handily won the 1978 election and continued to foster a national 
image as a controversial but dynamic Indian leader. The tribe last year signed 
a $1.5-million contract with a Washington, D.C. public relations and lobbying 
group partly owned by a non-Indian friend of MacDonald. 
</P>
<P>
"Big Mac's" taste for publicity proved so insatiable that his chief spokesman 
quit in disgust last fall, complaining that MacDonald was grandstanding. 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald's career derailed when he sought an unprecedented fourth term in 1982 
and lost to Zah, a Democratic attorney whose blue jeans and battered pickup 
signaled a dramatic change from the limousine and three-piece suit era of 
MacDonald. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally believe he was very angry at the Navajo people for showing their 
needs had changed, and he never forgave them," Zah said. 
</P>
<P>
Zah found "not a scrap of paper" on his new desk. Tribal police had to retrieve 
documents from MacDonald, who claimed they were all personal, Zah said. 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald moved to Phoenix, then reclaimed office in 1986 by a razor-thin 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
Now, MacDonald claims Zah and his supporters orchestrated the current brouhaha. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charges Not Filed 
</P>
<P>
Although no charges have been filed, a federal grand jury in Phoenix has 
subpoenaed boxes of documents, contracts, bids and proposals concerning tribal 
business deals during MacDonald's latest term. 
</P>
<P>
Zah considers revenge Peter MacDonald's motivating force. "He decided he was 
going to come back at any expense," Zah said. "His whole tactic was, 'I'm going 
to get back in there and once I do, I'm going to grab everything that's not 
nailed down, and that's what the Navajo people get.' " 
</P>
<P>
Wanda MacDonald describes her husband as a "warm and fuzzy" man who likes to 
take his mongrel puppy to bed at night and "would never take any bribes or do 
anything illegal." 
</P>
<P>
She likes to tell Peter MacDonald that he was born to lead his people. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll just kind of smile and shrug his shoulders."

NO SUSPECTS IN BREA SLAYING; 
</P>
<P>
MCKENNA WAS NOT SHADY, JUST FLAMBOYANT, SON SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA LUTHER, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The son of a bodybuilder-businessman who was slain in a gangland style ambush 
Thursday said Sunday that his father was "a little flamboyant" but far from the 
portrait painted of him as a shady businessman who lived extravagantly. 
</P>
<P>
"The man I knew and the man the family knew was a man who liked to joke around 
a lot, he was really nice," Michael McKenna, 23, said in an interview on his 
father's $825,000 estate in Brea. 
</P>
<P>
Horace Joseph McKenna, 46, who had convictions for counterfeiting and parole 
violation, died in a hail of gunfire about 12:30 p.m. Thursday as he was 
sleeping in the back seat of his limousine. The ambush occurred just as 
McKenna's chauffeur, Robert Berg, was pulling up to the gate at McKenna's 
40-acre estate. Berg was unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
There are no suspects in the case. McKenna will be buried Tuesday, his son 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred only hours after court records were unsealed unveiling a 
Los Angeles district attorney's tax fraud investigation of Horace McKenna and a 
business partner, Michael Woods. Those records alleged that Horace McKenna and 
Woods were the hidden owners of several nude and topless bars in Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Horace McKenna, who served in the California Highway Patrol from 1968 to 1972, 
was convicted in 1976 of counterfeiting and convicted in 1982 of parole 
violation after he was arrested on suspicion of assaulting an off-duty police 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
Michael McKenna said he agreed to be interviewed because he wanted everyone to 
know "the true part, the way my father really was. Not the man they portrayed 
as some big Mafia leader." He said his father "was as gentle as a kitten." 
</P>
<P>
None of the court records or police reports made public said that Horace 
McKenna was ever linked to organized crime or the Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
Michael McKenna said that as far as he knew, his father "was not into anything 
that had to do with the Mafia, nothing to do with gangs . . . nothing to do 
with prostitution or with drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Michael McKenna said he lives with his father's parents in Los Angeles County. 
He said he had spent weekends and other time with his father but never lived 
with him after his parents divorced when he was a child. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna allowed a reporter and a photographer into his father's rambling house. 
It is comfortable rather than elaborate, decorated with bronze statues of 
western scenes and stuffed animals that, according to his son, McKenna on big 
game ranches. It sits at the top of a green knoll in Carbon Canyon with a 
sweeping view of Orange County clear to Disneyland, where Michael McKenna said 
fireworks can be seen at night. 
</P>
<P>
As the hazy afternoon grew dimmer, McKenna showed his guests the ranch's many 
other buildings, including a 20-foot gazebo and stables with 16 horses, 
including his father's favorite, an American saddle horse named Lord. The horse 
pulled away as McKenna stroked its nose, and McKenna explained, "My Dad rode 
him every day, so Lord knows something is not right." 
</P>
<P>
Just down the blacktop road is a small mock "ghost town" his father had built 
as an amusement for himself and his friends. The ghost town has a saloon, a 
jail, a general store and other businesses from an old western outpost. At the 
entrance to the town is a "cemetery" with "headstones" for Dead Eye Dick ("He 
ain't fastest no more") and other cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
As a joke, there is even an out-of-era headstone for Superman, who, according 
to his marker, "tried to take on Mac." The elder McKenna was known as "Mac" to 
his friends. 
</P>
<P>
The hilly road up through the property that McKenna developed from rough 
acreage is peppered with Old West signs such as "Dead Man's Curve." 
</P>
<P>
A full 3 inches taller than his 6-foot-6 father, the younger McKenna said he 
used to enjoy horsing around with his dad. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A 46-Year-Old Kid' 
</P>
<P>
"We'd tear out around the house, tackle each other on the lawn or something, 
wrestle," McKenna said. "He was a 46-year-old kid." 
</P>
<P>
McKenna said his father did not drink or smoke and did not take drugs, nor were 
there ever any drug activities around the ranch home that he saw. He said that 
while his father, who was twice divorced, sometimes dated women half his age, 
there was no hint of a party life style. 
</P>
<P>
"People say it the way they want to say it," McKenna said. He said his father 
"was a man who liked to have fun. He liked to entertain. He had all kinds of 
friends." But he added, "He didn't give parties in the sense of loud banging 
music with people walking around. He liked to have people up here in the 
daytime, go horseback riding, to walk around the ranch and just generally 
relax." 
</P>
<P>
Even the brand new pool was designed for volleyball -- it is 7 feet deep in the 
middle and shallower at each end. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna said he believes his father made his money breeding Arabian horses and 
from profits on the 4 Star Gym in El Segundo, which he owned. McKenna said his 
father also owned some apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Of reports that his father had beaten his wife of 9 years, Sherry, from whom he 
was divorced 2 years ago, McKenna said, "Baloney. Absolute baloney." He said he 
and Sherry McKenna were not close, and that he "wondered why" his father took 
so long to divorce her. "If she was as cold to him as she was to me, I don't 
see why there wasn't a divorce the first day after they got married." 
</P>
<P>
The son said he saw no guns on the ranch except the shotgun his father used to 
shoot gophers. "I'd say out of every 10 shots, he may get one gopher, and we'd 
laugh about it," McKenna said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Little Frightened' 
</P>
<P>
Michael McKenna said he was "a little frightened, yeah," to be on the ranch 
where his father was slain. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in town for a while and I didn't get back until dark and I had to stop 
and unlock the gate," said McKenna, whose size might intimidate most intruders. 
"And I was petrified. I was very scared." 
</P>
<P>
But he said that he did not fear the murderers would return for him. 
</P>
<P>
"In my heart, (I know) it was just somebody who wanted my father," McKenna 
said. "Who, why -- I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
McKenna said that in the last several months his father had been dieting on 
low-fat yogurt, tuna fish sandwiches and water, bringing his weight down to 265 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
He said that as he was driving to Brea after learning of his father's death, he 
thought about the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew how much he loved the horses. I knew how much he loved the ranch. This 
was his dream. Right then and there my main concern was to keep it alive, to 
keep the dream alive." 
</P>
<P>
But he said he has not figured out how he will do it. The police and federal 
officers took his father's papers even before they allowed McKenna in the 
house, so he has no idea of what his father's assets are, or even how he might 
be able to pay the ranch hands. He said he was to have started a job as a 
security officer, but decided to delay that until his father's estate is 
straightened out. 
</P>
<P>
"There are too many unexplained questions, too much paper work," McKenna said. 
He said quietly, "My father and I were really good friends. We loved each 
other. . . . He was there for me whenever I needed him."

AMNESTY RULES CONFUSE, ANGER IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARITA HERNANDEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Irma de Jesus Efigenio was fit to be tied. "Don't get me started," she warned, 
standing in line at the immigration office with her infant son in tow. 
</P>
<P>
Efigenio clutched the baby stroller bar tightly as she launched into a non-stop 
tirade against the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. Since filing 
her application for amnesty more than a year ago, she said she has logged more 
than four times the required 40 hours of English instruction. She has missed 
work from her house-cleaning job and taken long bus rides to spend hours 
standing in line at immigration offices. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Maintain Status 
</P>
<P>
"All they ever do is tell me to go home and wait. . . . It's been 14 months and 
I haven't received a single notice in the mail, not a word!" the immigrant from 
Central America said, becoming increasingly angry as she spoke. "The waiting is 
terrible. The whole thing is a mess. It's enough to make you lose hope." 
</P>
<P>
Every day, a constant stream of angry, worried or confused immigrants file past 
the "problem window" at the INS' legalization office on Wilshire Boulevard. 
Like Efigenio, they are trying to avoid the dire consequence of not completing 
the two-phase amnesty process: reverting to illegal status and facing 
deportation again. 
</P>
<P>
By most accounts, the second phase of this massive amnesty program has gotten 
off to a slow start, riddled by confusion over complicated deadlines and 
education requirements, minimal publicity and funding problems. Drastic cuts 
threatened by the federal government could spell further trouble. 
</P>
<P>
More worrisome to INS officials than the problem cases that sometimes fall 
through the cracks are the thousands of applicants who haven't turned up at all 
for Phase 2 processing. During the first part of the program, which ended last 
June, immigrants were granted temporary resident status, a status they must 
maintain for 18 months before being considered for permanent resident. They 
then have one year to apply. Later, they may be eligible for citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
In this second phase, hundreds of thousands of applicants throughout the 
country must show that they have a basic knowledge of English, U.S. history and 
civics. A long list of exceptions will exempt many applicants from having to 
attend special classes. Setting up these classes and testing procedures has 
been no easy task, and hasn't even begun in some places. 
</P>
<P>
Only about 17% of the more than 300,000 applicants in the West who have become 
eligible for Phase 2 have claimed their much-coveted permanent resident "green 
cards." Before the program is over, about 1.8 million amnesty applicants in the 
region and 3 million nationwide are expected to gain permanent legal status. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still Early 
</P>
<P>
While immigration officials say that it is still early in the program and there 
is no cause for alarm, some immigrant advocates are beginning to question 
whether the amnesty program will live up to its promise. 
</P>
<P>
INS officials point out that there are still more than seven months left before 
final application deadlines begin coming due. Western Region officials, 
however, acknowledging some concern, recently eased their rules hoping to clear 
some of the confusion over application deadlines. Immigrants now may file their 
applications for permanent resident at any time, rather than having to wait for 
the 18-month period to elapse. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm somewhat concerned. All of us have mulled over what would happen if we 
gave this party and nobody came. We had the same concern in Phase 1 and it 
proved unfounded," said Peter Gordon, chief of examinations at the INS Western 
Regional Processing Facility in Laguna Niguel, where thousands of amnesty 
applications are adjudicated. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, if I see my figures decrease, then I'm going to sit down at the 
drawing board to figure out what we have to do to modify the regulations for 
people to come forward," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Domingo A. Rodriguez, coordinator of the Los Angeles Unified School District's 
amnesty program, says that the low rate of Phase 2 applications may be worse 
than federal officials admit. Surveys of the district's 120,000 amnesty 
students show that less than 3% of eligible applicants have actually returned 
to file their applications, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Dismal Failure' 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said potential Phase 2 applicants are "totally confused" by the 
program's staggered deadlines and educational requirements, which were spelled 
out in the 1986 immigration reform law. He places much of the blame on INS' 
outreach efforts, which he called "a dismal failure." 
</P>
<P>
While the federal government spent more than $11 million to publicize Phase 1 
of the amnesty program, INS officials said no money was budgeted for Phase 2. 
And the state has been "sitting on" $900,000 earmarked for outreach, Rodriguez 
and other immigrant advocates complained. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government has budgeted $4 billion to reimburse the states for 
educational, health and welfare services for the new immigrants. California's 
share is $1.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
California, with nearly 60% of the nation's amnesty applicants, has been in the 
lead in establishing programs for the immigrants. Even so, the state Health and 
Welfare Agency, which is administering the federal funds, has been roundly 
criticized for being slow in releasing funds to community groups and school 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
"They have been very slow and bureaucratic," said Linda Mitchell, spokeswoman 
for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles. Some community 
programs that have been operating for several months have yet to receive a 
penny, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the community organizations that guided immigrants through Phase 1 of 
the program have scaled back or closed down altogether, she said. Many lost 
money because the limited government reimbursement did not cover expenses, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The immigrant community's need for help through Phase 2 is not being 
addressed," she said. Although officials say that immigrants can receive 
information at INS legalization offices, coalition members are already 
receiving reports of applicants being overcharged as much as $500 for filling 
out forms by unscrupulous private consultants and attorneys, Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Mitchell added, "the bad guys this time are not the INS, but the state." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INS More Cooperative 
</P>
<P>
Her statement reflects a big change in the often contentious relationship 
between immigrant rights groups and the INS during the earlier part of the 
program. Like immigrant advocates throughout the country, the coalition had 
strongly criticized the agency for what it called a restrictive application of 
the law. The amnesty program, which forced the federal agency to serve illegal 
immigrants rather than deport them, forged a "more cooperative spirit" between 
the two factions, Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
This time it is the state that's holding things up, Mitchell said. "That's 
where the logjam is." 
</P>
<P>
A battle is under way in the Legislature to add $50 million to the $121 million 
already budgeted this year for the basic education program for immigrants. 
Education Department officials have said that unless the money is added, the 
state will be forced to close classes in the program, which is already badly 
under-funded. In some areas of the state, where the demand for classes far 
outstrips services, there are waiting lists of up to six months. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian and other state officials, however, argue that if more 
money is allocated for education, this will, in turn, strain health and welfare 
programs for the new immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
But educators see it differently: "We have a golden opportunity as a society to 
help people become productive citizens. If we let it slip through our fingers, 
we will only end up hurting ourselves in the long run," said Rodriguez, of the 
Los Angeles school district. Amnesty students in the district average about 174 
hours of class work, well beyond the INS requirement. 
</P>
<P>
Most school districts in the state have been slower than Los Angeles to set up 
classes for amnesty applicants, Rodriguez said. And "most states haven't even 
gotten started," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that much of the money appropriated for the program this year has gone 
unclaimed by the states, President Bush has proposed taking back $600 million 
of the $4 billion Congress earmarked for state reimbursement. And Sen. Edward 
M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) has proposed transferring $200 million for emergency 
services for Soviet and Indochinese refugees. 
</P>
<P>
"The interest level on immigration is not there anymore. Congress is moving on 
to new ideas and, in the process, taking away pieces of the pie from the people 
they set about to legalize two years ago," said Peter Schey, a leading 
immigration attorney and director of the National Center for Immigrants Rights 
Inc. in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reneging on Promise 
</P>
<P>
Added Rodriguez: "In its quest to balance the budget, the Administration is 
attempting to renege on a promise made to help these people." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Swartz, of the Washington-based National Immigration, Refugee and 
Citizenship Forum, said that there are some "serious efforts" under way for 
compromise legislation to allow lending the money earmarked for amnesty 
programs to other refugee services, but returning it as the program picks up 
speed. 
</P>
<P>
"The need for this money is inevitably going to increase as newly legalized 
people continue to get their feet on the ground and feel more comfortable 
seeking educational and health services," Swartz said. "These are massive new 
programs and the administrative structures needed to implement them are still

SCHOOLS' ACTION WIDENS THE APPLE CONTROVERSY; 
</P>
<P>
DECISIONS BY L.A., N.Y. DISTRICTS TO STOP SELLING FRUIT IN CAFETERIAS SPARK 
DISPARATE REACTIONS 
</P>

<P>
The decision by the nation's two largest school districts to stop serving 
apples and apple products to students has dramatically widened a years-old 
controversy over the chemical daminozide, used under the trade name Alar, to 
make apples redder and last longer. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's moves by the Los Angeles Unified School District and New York City 
schools -- which together sell more than 18 million apples in cafeterias and 
vending machines each year -- have sparked disparate reactions among parents, 
pediatricians and other school districts. 
</P>
<P>
The actions have also further upset apple growers and importers who say they 
have been taking steps to put the controversy behind them and who view many of 
the recent disclosures about the chemical as inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Signs Posted in Stores 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, major California grocery retailers such as Vons, Lucky, 
Ralphs and Safeway have posted signs in their stores to reassure customers that 
they have ordered suppliers to certify that their apples are not treated with 
Alar. But most stores apparently have not yet acted to ensure that apple 
products such as juice and applesauce are free of the chemical. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators from some school districts reached Sunday said they had been 
unaware of the controversy until they learned of the Los Angeles school 
district's decision to remove apples and apple products from student 
cafeterias. But at least one district, Glendale Unified, said it had already 
taken steps to ensure that the apples and juice offered to its students were 
free of the chemical. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, pediatricians, besieged by calls from concerned parents, have 
offered conflicting advice. One doctor from Newhall advised clients to stop 
buying apples until more information becomes available, while another 
pediatrician familiar with pesticide hazards contended that there is no cause 
for alarm. 
</P>
<P>
Some Los Angeles-area consumers say they will drastically change their buying 
habits by turning to specialty stores and cooperatives for "organic" apples 
grown without pesticides or other chemicals or by cutting back on their 
consumption of fruits and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it's overreaction," said Marcy Axness, a Los Angeles mother who buys 
only organic apples and apple juice for her 1 1/2-year-old son, Ian. "But I'd 
rather err on the side of caution." 
</P>
<P>
The range of reactions was an indication that the emotional issue of apple 
safety has raised far more questions than answers in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy over Alar first erupted nearly four years ago when the 
Environmental Protection Agency initially recommended a ban on the chemical's 
use on food but later backed down. The furor was reignited Feb. 28 when the 
nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington issued a report 
charging that children, because of their lower body weight, were particularly 
at risk of contracting cancer from products treated with Alar. 
</P>
<P>
Further publicity about the findings on CBS-TV's "60 Minutes" news program and 
subsequent appearances by actress Meryl Streep on talk shows added more fuel, 
culminating in the school districts' decisions to ban apples, which for 
centuries have been considered the epitome of healthful food. 
</P>
<P>
The apple industry continued to maintain Sunday that the tarnishing of the 
apple's image stems from faulty information. 
</P>
<P>
Derl I. Derr, president of the International Apple Institute in McLean, Va., 
called the Los Angeles school district's action "very inappropriate." He noted 
that less than 5% of the U.S. crop was treated with Alar last year, down from 
30% in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to counter growing concern over the chemical, the institute last 
week placed full-page ads in major newspapers quoting a health expert as saying 
"apples are as healthy as ever." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Eastes, general manager of David Oppenheimer-California, which imports 
fruit from Chile, contended that the Alar scare is "just totally out of hand." 
He characterized much of the material being disseminated as "disinformation . . 
. reminiscent of witch hunts and charlatanism." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Call for Balance 
</P>
<P>
Frieda Caplan, chief executive of Frieda's Finest, a Los Angeles-based marketer 
of specialty produce, noted that "there's got to be a balance and an 
understanding of what the real risks are." 
</P>
<P>
"What (consumers) have to realize is that when the industry became aware of the 
Alar thing four years ago, most growers stopped using it," she said. "We want 
to satisfy them and encourage sales of fresh fruits and vegetables, so we've 
been encouraging growers to grow as free of pesticides as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Washington is the nation's leading producer of apples, followed by New York, 
Michigan, California, Pennsylvania, Virginia and North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
Clark Biggs, a spokesman for the California Farm Bureau Federation in 
Sacramento, said state records showed no use of Alar on apples grown in 
California last year. California's 1988 crop has already been sold out, 
according to Dan Anderson, general manager of Kingsburg Apple Packers in the 
San Joaquin Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Daminozide is made by Uniroyal Chemical Co., based in Middlebury, Conn., and a 
unit of Avery Inc., which sells it under the brand name Alar. The chemical is 
technically classified as a growth regulator rather than a pesticide because it 
is not used to kill insects. 
</P>
<P>
Developed in 1969, it has proved effective in reducing orchard losses from 
premature dropping of apples and in producing crisper, more colorful apples 
with a longer storage life. Although it is not used on green apples such as 
Granny Smiths, Anderson noted that "apples in general have been blacklisted" 
because of the concern over Alar. 
</P>
<P>
According to Uniroyal Chemical, sales of the chemical have dropped by more than 
half since 1985, when the first concerns were sounded. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Customer Reassurance 
</P>
<P>
Major grocery chains -- caught between growers and consumers -- have sought to 
reassure customers that their apples are, and have been for some time, free of 
Alar residue. In 1986, Safeway was the first major chain to quit accepting 
Alar-treated apples. Companies such as Vons, Ralphs and Lucky have followed 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles school district, however, gets its apples from wholesalers in 
the city's produce district and apple juice from a variety of dairies, 
according to Randy Altenberg, deputy director of food services for the Los 
Angeles school district. Most applesauce, he added, is donated by the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
The district, he said, would suspend serving of apples and apple products until 
it conducts its own tests and receives word from the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
Other Southland school districts were divided in their approaches. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be speaking with our food service director first thing this 
week," said Arthur N. Pierce, superintendent of the 16,400-student Burbank 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
But in Glendale, where 22,000 students attend classes, district officials 
several days ago requested chemical analyses and were assured by suppliers that 
the apples and juice offered to Glendale students were free of daminozide, 
according to Victor J. Pallos, a spokesman for the Glendale Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
Still other school officials said Sunday that evidence presented thus far in 
the controversy has not convinced them that apples, treated or otherwise, are 
bad for students. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Plans to Act 
</P>
<P>
"Until we get something a little more conclusive, we're not going to do 
anything," said Dale A. Henson, director of food services for the 9,600-student 
Lancaster School District. "I don't think the issue is quite the ball of fire 
here as it is in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of that publicity, some California pediatricians say they have been 
flooded with calls from concerned parents seeking reassurance and advice. 
Loraine Stern, a Newhall pediatrician, said she has advised clients to "just 
hold off on all apple products until we get more information." 
</P>
<P>
But Richard J. Jackson, a Berkeley pediatrician who is chair of the American 
Academy of Pediatrics' committee on environmental hazards, said he sees no 
cause for immediate alarm. "At the present time, the committee concurs that 
risks of pesticides in the diet are remote, long-term and theoretical," he said 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Lucky grocery chain said it is now trying to ensure that 
house-brand apple products such as juices and applesauce are also certified as 
being free of Alar residue. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been . . . doing extensive work with producers of our private-label 
(apple) products" and are requiring that they ask suppliers of apples to 
certify that they have not been treated with the chemical, said Christopher M. 
McLain, vice president, secretary and general counsel of Lucky Stores. Once 
Lucky has received such guarantees, he said, it will post signs in stores to 
that effect. 
</P>
<P>
As for national-brand goods, he said, "We have told the suppliers what we are 
planning on doing, but we are not insisting that they follow the same course of 
action."

'BIG MAC' SLAYING INQUIRY REACHES INTO DARK WORLD OF 'ADULT' CLUBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Big Mac is dead, but at the Bare Elegance, life goes on without so much as a 
moment of silence. 
</P>
<P>
The husky doorman takes your $8, and the bartender charges $3.50 for a weak 
orange juice. If you place a dollar on the rail, the dancers linger and flirt a 
moment longer before moving on to the next guy. Some dancers wear black -- 
teddies, garters and such -- but the effect is not one of mourning. 
</P>
<P>
Ask employees about the late Horace Joseph McKenna -- their purported boss, 
gunned down in mobster fashion Thursday in his limousine at the gate of his 
Brea horse ranch -- and they are less than effusive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Better Not to Know 
</P>
<P>
Talk isn't cheap, not here, not in a milieu where a tax fraud investigation 
apparently winds up in murder. One club manager told detectives she didn't care 
to hear rumors. What she didn't know, she figured, couldn't hurt her. 
</P>
<P>
So you leave the Bare Elegance, its watchful management and hulking bouncers. 
At another strip joint a dancer helps explain how McKenna could live such a 
lavish life style. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you kidding?" she snaps. "These places make beaucoup dinero." 
</P>
<P>
McKenna, the 6-foot, 6-inch, 300-pound body builder and former California 
Highway Patrol officer, controlled several of these places, say investigators 
for the Los Angeles County district attorney's office. The Bare Elegance is 
just one of five such "live adult entertainment" clubs the investigators allege 
that McKenna secretly owned with his partner, former highway patrolman Michael 
Woods. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office said it may be several weeks before formal 
charges are brought against participants in the alleged tax fraud conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Only a Front, Some Say 
</P>
<P>
Through attorneys, Woods and other owners-of-record have denied a conspiracy 
exists. The dancer said McKenna was only a front -- that the clubs are really 
owned by "some people in New York." 
</P>
<P>
Although alcohol sales are forbidden in nude clubs, an investigative auditor 
projected a collective legitimate gross of more than $2.5 million annually. 
Investigators also suspect untold illicit profits through drug dealing, 
prostitution and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna, however, most recently reported a taxable income of less than $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
Warrants and affidavits unsealed Wednesday -- the day before McKenna was killed 
-- as well as a visit to the Bare Elegance provides a glimpse into a world that 
many people never encounter and few patrons understand. 
</P>
<P>
It is a business where a man listed on official records as the "owner" cleans 
tables, while a man this "owner" describes as a "part-time bartender" counts 
the night's cash receipts; where managers say they make only $1,500 per month, 
while dancers who make minimum wage might take home hundreds of dollars per 
shift in extra fees and tips; where a boss' management style may involve 
regular lie-detector tests and threats of violence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Labor Dispute 
</P>
<P>
Like other enterprises, the "adult live entertainment industry" has its labor 
disputes. Recently, according to two sources familiar with the Bare Elegance, 
at least three dancers left the club in a spat over "topless table dancing" -- 
essentially a semi-private, very-up-close-and-personal version of the stage 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty much what you make it," one dancer said. 
</P>
<P>
It is also a major source of revenue. At the Bare Elegance, a patron pays $15 
per song, not including tip, for such a session. A popular woman can make 
hundreds of dollars per shift for herself and for the club, sources say. The 
dispute, sources said, involved the size of the house cut. 
</P>
<P>
District attorney's investigators said they concluded that McKenna and Woods 
controlled at least five clubs after a probe that lasted more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the clubs -- Bare Elegance, the New Jet Strip and the Star Strip -- 
are located near Los Angeles International Airport. The other two -- April's 
Cabaret and the Odd Ball -- are in Sepulveda in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide investigators are now probing reports that McKenna may have tried to 
purchase the Mustang Club in Santa Ana in 1987, before its owner, Jimmy Casino, 
was killed by gunmen. The possibility of a relationship between the deaths of 
Casino and McKenna is just one of many possible leads, authorities say. Woods 
and McKenna "play 'the good guy, bad guy' game," one informant told 
investigators, explaining that McKenna was the intimidator, while Woods would 
try to soothe feelings. 
</P>
<P>
That informant estimated that McKenna took about 75% of the profits, while 
Woods took 25%. Investigators linked the supposedly unrelated clubs in part 
through interviews in which employees apparently inadvertently told of being 
"promoted" or "transferred" from one club to another. 
</P>
<P>
Among those employees was Robert Berg, who was chauffeuring the limousine in 
which McKenna was killed. Berg, according to investigators, told them he was 
promoted from a doorman at the New Jet Strip to the post of assistant manager 
at April's Cabaret. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Counting the Money 
</P>
<P>
At the Gardena club, the Sly Fox, investigators said they watched the 
owner-of-record clean tables while "part-time bartender" James Carroll Wallace, 
described as "a close and trusted associate of McKenna," counted cash receipts. 
</P>
<P>
"When the interview with Wallace first focused on McKenna," investigators 
asserted, "Wallace started to perspire and became fidgety." Other purported 
employees, including Michael Woods' brother, Richard, acknowledged they feared 
McKenna. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna's relationship with former and current law enforcement officers 
frustrated the probe, investigators said. One employee refused to talk even 
with an offer of confidentiality. 
</P>
<P>
"That man can hurt people," he told investigators. "Mac has friends in the 
Police Department. Anything I say will get back to him." 
</P>
<P>
It was not surprising the other night to hear a dancer say she was neither 
saddened nor shocked by McKenna's death. Her primary reaction, she said, was 
one of relief. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just so glad," she said, "that no one was in the back seat with him." 
</P>
<P>
The mourning is left for McKenna's family. 
</P>
<P>
Michael McKenna, 23, on Sunday gave a reporter and a photographer a tour of the 
40-acre Brea estate, saying he wanted everyone to know "the true part." His 
father, he said, was "a little flamboyant," but he was good to his family, "as 
gentle as a kitten."

INVESTIGATORS, UNSURE OF BOMB MOTIVE, TURN TO PUBLIC FOR CLUES 
</P>

<P>
After a meticulous two-day search of the scene, representatives of five law 
enforcement agencies were still uncertain Sunday whether the bombing of a van 
driven by the wife of Navy skipper Will Rogers III was a terrorist act. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI, which is coordinating the investigation, on Sunday appealed to the 
public for help in developing leads to the pipe-bomb attack Friday morning from 
which Sharon Rogers escaped unhurt. Her husband's order to shoot down an 
aircraft mistakenly thought to be an attacking Iranian jet fighter last July 
over the Persian Gulf led to Iranian threats of retaliation against the United 
States. The downed plane turned out of be an Iranian civilian airliner. All 290 
aboard were killed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Speculation on Bombing 
</P>
<P>
Investigators have speculated that the bombing of Mrs. Rogers' car may have 
been an act of retaliation, although they have not ruled out such other motives 
as a disgruntled sailor. 
</P>
<P>
FBI spokesman Gene Riehl said that "in a perfect world, we would like to find 
somebody who saw something very suspicious and out of place. We're looking for 
people who saw anything suspicious" around the bombing scene in the La Jolla 
district of San Diego. Riehl said investigators already have received dozens of 
calls, "all generally helpful," about the incident. "It is a great help and we 
solve a huge number of cases with the help of callers," Riehl said. 
</P>
<P>
Also Sunday, Thomas Hughes, head of the FBI office in San Diego, and Dennis 
Usery, head of the Naval Investigative Service office here, met with the 
Rogerses at an undisclosed location to discuss the investigation. Hughes 
described the couple as "in good spirits." They have moved from their home near 
the scene of the explosion and are under NIS guard. 
</P>
<P>
The executive officer of Rogers' ship, the Vincennes, has taken over for the 
captain in the last two days, but Rogers will resume his full command duties 
shortly, a Navy spokesman said. Rogers will remain with the Vincennes until a 
long-scheduled change of command takes place this July, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drums of Debris 
</P>
<P>
FBI laboratory experts spent Sunday sifting through three drums filled with 
debris collected near the site of the explosion and fire on Genesee Avenue 
south of La Jolla Village Drive. Investigators finished their examination of 
the scene late Saturday and moved the burned-out shell of the Rogers van to an 
FBI garage, Riehl said. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been items of evidentiary value shipped to our laboratory in 
Washington, D.C." Riehl added. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement Sunday afternoon, Hughes said investigators from the FBI, 
the Naval Investigative Service, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, 
the San Diego Police Department and the San Diego County Sheriff's Department 
"are all working very hard together to resolve the matter." Hughes refused to 
discuss the progress of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The mangement and staff of all five agencies met all day Sunday to "evaluate 
the investigation" and discuss plans for the coming days and weeks, Riehl said. 
</P>
<P>
Riehl refused to respond to an editorial in an Iranian newspaper that blamed 
the FBI for the bombing and contended the incident was engineered to provoke 
anti-Iranian sentiment in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not responding to that at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The English-language newspaper Kayhan International linked the alleged U.S. 
plot to Western anger at Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's order that British 
novelist Salman Rushdie be killed for his book, "The Satanic Verses." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Iranian Charge 
</P>
<P>
The bombing "will not be the last attempt to implicate Iran" over the Rushdie 
controversy, Kayhan International said in an editorial summarized by Iran's 
official Islamic Republic News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press reported that FBI spokeswoman Kathy Kennedy in Washington 
deniedthe allegation and added: "We have never made any linkage to Iran since 
this incident happened." 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred at 7:40 a.m. Friday as Sharon Rogers was en route to her 
job at a private elementary school in La Jolla. Hearing what sounded like two 
loud noises underneath the vehicle, she initially thought a motorist had struck 
her van from behind. Moments after she stepped out to check for damage, the van 
exploded into a fireball, but she was unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
FBI officials have confirmed that a pipe bomb attached to the vehicle caused 
the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
A Navy spokesman in San Diego said Sunday that a telephone threat received by 
Sharon Rogers last July, shortly after the Iranian plane was shot down, was 
thoroughly investigated at the time and was determined to be a "hoax." Sharon 
Rogers hung up on the unidentified caller after he asked, "Are you the wife of 
the murderer?" 
</P>
<P>
"That was a hoax," said Chief Petty Officer Craig Huebler, a spokesman for the 
San Diego Naval Base. "We went through all the steps we normally do in 
investigating these incidents. We checked out the entire situation and 
determined that this was not a real threat." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hoax Calls 
</P>
<P>
"Sad to say, but we receive many of these calls," Huebler said. "Our families 
are the first ones, normally, to get these kinds of hoax phone calls . . . 
almost as soon as an incident occurs." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, he said, the threats are sexual. At other times, unidentified 
callers telephone the wives of sailors and report that their husbands, who are 
out to sea, have been injured or killed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We get these things all the time," Huebler said. "We straighten them out 
quickly. But there is still the initial panic and fear."

Italian dock workers began a 48-hour strike Sunday in a battle over government 
plans to liberalize freight handling. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist-based CGIL, the biggest of Italy's three main union 
confederations, called the strike after officials authorized two private 
companies to start handling freight in the port of Genoa. 
</P>
<P>
Port operations have been disrupted by strikes for two months.

WALESA AND POLAND'S CHIEF DEFEND TALKS

Solidarity founder Lech Walesa said Sunday that talks with the government can 
be a bridgehead for democracy in Communist Poland, while Poland's leader, Gen. 
Wojciech Jaruzelski, rejected suggestions that the talks marked a retreat from 
communism. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa, addressing the 135-member Citizens' Committee he organized in December, 
said that despite many "doubts and question marks," agreements reached at the 
talks can be guaranteed by participation of opposition groups in political life 
for the first time since martial law in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"We should consider what we should do now, so that the round-table talks are a 
bridgehead for further victories," he told the pro-Solidarity Citizens' 
Committee that is seen as a shadow cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa also urged moderation by union officials at the talks, saying 
authorities should not be called to account for past failures and that a 
compromise should be reached. "There is a favorable international climate for 
Polish reforms," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Citizens' Committee later issued a statement approving the results of the 
talks so far but noted that there have been stalemates in several crucial areas 
such as local self-government, access to the mass media, the activities of 
associations and some law and order issues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decision Defended 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to Warsaw party officials Saturday night, Jaruzelski defended the 
leadership's decision to negotiate with the union, which he suppressed by the 
imposition of martial law in 1981. The government outlawed the union in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"We should reject ideas ascribed to our party that the solutions discussed (at 
the table) were pulled from our throat," Jaruzelski said in the speech that was 
carried Sunday by the official news agency PAP. "It is not an act of mercy. It 
is not a gift for the opposition . . . it is simply a chance for Poland." 
</P>
<P>
He said the options included "an iron fist," total surrender or an agreement 
with the opposition "to ensure the strengthening of Poland and its harmonious 
modern development. We have chosen the third road." 
</P>
<P>
Calling the agreement "a first step," he acknowledged the severity of the 
economic crisis in Poland, saying, "Further steps will give evidence if we are 
really capable of achieving normalcy." 
</P>
<P>
The Citizens' Committee met for the second time since it was formed to assess 
the progress after four weeks of talks. Most members are taking part in the 
talks, which are scheduled to produce an agreement on ways of the overhauling 
of the political and economic system by April 3.

EXTREME RIGHTISTS WIN FRANKFURT COUNCIL SEATS

<TEXT>
<P>
An extreme rightist party won seven City Council seats in Frankfurt on Sunday 
in municipal elections in the state of Hesse that dealt a crushing defeat to 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
The extreme-right National Democratic Party took 6.6% of the vote, according to 
preliminary results, winning representation in Frankfurt's city government for 
the first time since 1968. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 29, another far-right party, the Republicans, 7.5% of the vote and 11 
seats in West Berlin's legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Both parties want to sharply reduce the number of foreigners in West Germany, 
and their success marks a significant shift to the right among a growing number 
of voters. 
</P>
<P>
Much like the Republicans, the Frankfurt National Democratic Party led its 
campaign with calls of "stop foreigners" and "Germany for the Germans." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Foreign Workers Blamed 
</P>
<P>
It blames foreign workers, petitioners for asylum and ethnic German refugees 
from Eastern Europe for a high level of drug-related crime and a housing 
shortage in Frankfurt. One-quarter of the city's 620,000 inhabitants are 
foreign, the highest proportion of any city in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"One thinks more nationally today," said NPD city parliament candidate Winfried 
Krauss, who credited "the flood of foreigners" for his party's gain. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome in Frankfurt appeared to pave the way for a leftist coalition in 
Frankfurt between the Social Democrats and the environmentalist Greens. 
</P>
<P>
A similar coalition is expected to start governing in West Berlin next week 
after an agreement between the Social Democrats and the Alternative List, a 
leftist party similar to the Greens. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome ousted Frankfurt's Christian Democratic Mayor Wolfram Brueck, who 
will be replaced by Social Democrat Volker Hauff, a 48-year-old former federal 
transport minister. 
</P>
<P>
About two hours after the preliminary results of the vote became known, several 
hundred people demonstrated in front of the city hall against the National 
Democrats. Police reported no incidents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worst Route in Frankfurt 
</P>
<P>
Kohl's conservatives suffered heavy losses in other municipalities in Hesse 
state, but their worst rout came in Frankfurt, where they had governed alone 
since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results from the official state voting office, based on computer 
projections, gave the Christian Democrats 36.6% of the Frankfurt vote. That 
dropped their representation in city government from 48 to 36 seats in the 
93-seat city legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The leftist Social Democrats, the mainstream opposition party, won 40.1% and 40 
seats, up from 37 seats won after 1985 elections. The Greens won 10.1% and 10 
seats, up from eight previously. 
</P>
<P>
The National Democrats did not run in the 1985 elections. 
</P>
<P>
The leftist Greens also scored major gains in the rest of Hesse state, where 
4.1 million voters were eligible to vote.

<P>
Afghanistan's President Najibullah issued a new appeal to the United Nations to 
help bring peace to his country as rebel sources reported heavy fighting on 
Sunday near the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad. 
</P>
<P>
Najibullah's message to U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar again 
accused Pakistan of sending commandos and military helicopters to aid the 
moujahedeen rebels. Pakistan has denied the charges. 
</P>
<P>
In Kabul, an Afghan government spokesman said two Americans fighting alongside 
Afghan rebels as advisers were among those killed in the battle. A Pentagon 
spokeswoman in Washington said she could not confirm the report. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Soviet Union began airlifting flour into Kabul on Sunday for the 
first time since Soviet troops left a month ago. A spokesman in the capital 
denied that the food situation was serious. 
</P>
<P>
Two Antonov transports arrived from the Soviet city of Tashkent, each carrying 
10 tons of flour, and the spokesman said 20 similar loads will arrive soon. 
</P>
<P>
Some Soviet supplies have moved into Afghanistan via the 300-mile Salang 
Highway. An Afghan official said last week about 560 trucks have been robbed by 
moujahedeen rebels along the highway in the last three months.

LATVIANS RALLY OVER LANGUAGE ISSUE

About 250,000 Latvians rallied Sunday in the Soviet republic's capital of Riga 
to press for official recognition of the Latvian language and voice support for 
political and economic reforms, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
Sarmite Elerte, head of information for Latvia's Popular Front organization, 
said speakers at the rally backed proposed legislation that would entrench the 
Latvian language in day-to-day affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Many carried the red and white national flag of the Baltic republic and 
placards supporting Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of economic 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"Never before have I seen so many of our flags in public," Elerte said by 
telephone from Riga. "People wanted to show their support for our language. 
They also wanted to say that democratization cannot be stopped in Latvia." 
</P>
<P>
Elerte said that although the language law has raised tension recently in the 
republic, there have been no incidents. 
</P>
<P>
Some participants, she said, carried posters lampooning Interfront, a group 
representing mainly Russian speakers which has opposed the new language law in 
Latvia. 
</P>
<P>
Interfront, in an open letter to a Latvian newspaper last week, denounced the 
planned legislation, saying it incurred needless costs and ignored the rights 
of what it said was a majority of non-Latvians in the republic. 
</P>
<P>
According to 1979 figures, Latvians make up 53% of the republic's population 
after mass immigration of Russians in recent years.

U.S. MILITARY HELD RELUCTANT TO ACT ON PANAMA INCIDENTS

U.S. troops in Panama have been subjected to abductions and beatings, but U.S. 
military officials reportedly are reluctant to respond to avoid confrontation 
with Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, a military newspaper said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Army Times, an independent weekly, said U.S. military personnel in Panama 
have been involved in hundreds of incidents with Panamanian troops over the 
last year, ranging from detentions without charge and beatings to treaty 
violations and intrusions on U.S. installations. 
</P>
<P>
Quoting current and former officials, the newspaper said that "despite an 
escalating pattern of harassment against U.S. military personnel and their 
families, high-ranking military officials have sought to downplay the extent of 
the incidents in order to avoid a new confrontation" with Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega, under indictment in the United States on drug-trafficking charges, 
withstood the Reagan Administration's effort last year to force him from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
The Army Times quoted Elliott Abrams, who was President Ronald Reagan's chief 
Central American policy-maker in the State Department, as saying that Joint 
Chiefs Chairman William J. Crowe Jr. has tried to "bury the incidents to 
achieve a business-as-usual relationship with Noriega." 
</P>
<P>
A Crowe spokesman, Col. William Smullen, told the newspaper that "the chairman 
has chosen to deal with it in a more private way." 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said one of the most recent and violent incidents involved Navy 
petty officer Mike Nieves, who told the newspaper he was detained, beaten and 
threatened with death.

'BOMB' AT IRANIAN RESTAURANT FORCES ORANGE EVACUATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About five homes and 10 businesses in Orange had to be evacuated Sunday morning 
when a device believed to be a pipe bomb was found propped against an Iranian 
restaurant, police reported. 
</P>
<P>
After about three anxious hours, police dismantled the device and found it was 
a cleverly made fake bomb, said Orange Police Sgt. Timm Browne. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no explosive in it. But it was rigged to look like a bomb if it were 
X-rayed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured, and the evacuation was orderly and without incident, Browne 
said. The scene of the bomb scare was a shopping center on North Tustin Avenue 
near Taft Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Real Concern 
</P>
<P>
"There have been no threats received by anyone (about a possible bomb), and no 
one has come forward to claim responsibility," Browne added. "There was concern 
that this was a real pipe bomb, and there was some speculation that someone 
might have placed it (at an Iranian-owned restaurant) in retaliation for the 
San Diego van-bombing incident." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the wife of the skipper of the Navy ship Vincennes, escaped injury 
when a bomb ripped apart the van she was driving. 
</P>
<P>
The Vincennes, commanded by Capt. Will Rogers III, last July mistakenly shot 
down an Iranian airliner over the Persian Gulf, killing all 290 aboard the 
plane.

The sound of Sunday church bells in Britain is fading. 
</P>
<P>
A survey published Sunday showed that a third of the nation's church bells do 
not peal on the Sabbath because modern distractions have taken a toll among 
those trained to ring them. 
</P>
<P>
About 400,000 Britons know the ropes of bell-ringing but only 40,000 still pull 
them, said the study commissioned by the Central Council of Church Bell 
Ringers. 
</P>
<P>
"When I learned to ring 35 years ago there was not much else to do in the 
village where I lived," said Ron Johnston, a university professor who carried 
out the survey. 
</P>
<P>
"The church was a closer-knit community, and if you were a bell-ringer you felt 
obliged to turn up," he said.

JESSE JACKSON LEADS TRIBUTE TO OFFICER JACKSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An impressive array of black community leaders, celebrities and politicians -- 
led by the Rev. Jesse Jackson -- gathered in Hollywood on Sunday evening to pay 
tribute to Don Jackson, the Hawthorne police sergeant and self-styled crusader 
against alleged police abuse of minorities. 
</P>
<P>
More than 500 supporters, who jammed a ballroom at the Hollywood Roosevelt, 
donated more than $15,000 to Don Jackson, who is on disability leave. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Jackson, who earlier in the day joined striking Eastern Airline 
mechanics in a picket line at Los Angeles International Airport, called Don 
Jackson "a hero, and the messenger before the storm." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) organized the tribute to Jackson, 
who gained national recognition in January, when an NBC camera crew filmed him 
as a Long Beach police officer apparently pushed him through a plate glass 
window. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles) called Jackson "an ordinary person who 
has done extraordinary things. . . . So often when you go out a limb there is 
no tree there to support you. We are your tree. No one is going to mess with 
you, because when they mess with you, they mess with us." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Life in Possible Danger 
</P>
<P>
Waters told the gathering that Jackson's life could be in danger and that they 
should "keep their eyes out for him." 
</P>
<P>
Don Jackson, 31, has been criticized as a dangerous provocateur by police in 
Long Beach and in other Los Angeles-area cities, where he has launched his 
so-called "sting" operations. 
</P>
<P>
Don Jackson, whose birthday was Sunday, said the party -- which reached 
revival-meeting fervor when Dionne Warwick sang "That's What Friends Are For" 
-- would reinvigorate him as he prepares to stand trial Wednesday on a charge 
of obstructing a police officer in the Long Beach incident. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm overwhelmed," Jackson said. "I've been struggling with this issue for over 
seven years and I never thought I would see what I'm seeing today -- support 
from the people who I am working for. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Jackson ended his 20-minute speech by urging the crowd to make 
donations to Jackson, who has received just a fraction of his full pay since he 
went on stress disability leave after several alleged incidents of racism 
within the Hawthorne department. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blames Reagan 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Jackson said the brutality of which Don Jackson has complained had its 
roots in the Reagan Administration and "eight years of an absence of moral 
leadership in the White House, which has put a curse on our nation. 
</P>
<P>
"If you haven't been brutalized in this environment, it's only because your 
number hasn't come up in the lottery," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"President Bush should exalt you," the clergyman told Don Jackson. "You're the 
best America has."

Walking the Coals With Baby No Sweat to Moms 
</P>
<P>
Is the way to the delivery room paved with burning coals? 
</P>
<P>
Mary Russell, a North County hypnotherapist, thinks maybe so. For years she has 
taught a course on "Childbirth Fulfillment With Hypnosis" in Escondido to 
reduce the fear and pain of childbirth. Now she's added a new (and optional) 
touch: fire walking. 
</P>
<P>
Russell figured that if expectant mothers saw how hypnosis allowed them to walk 
pain-free across 7 feet of hot embers, their terror of the delivery room would 
diminish. So four of her students gathered recently in the back yard of 
Russell's home in the San Pasqual Valley. 
</P>
<P>
First came a three-hour lecture by Russell's husband, who is also a 
hypnotherapist and regularly conducts fire walking exhibitions. Next, The Walk. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no heat and no pressure," said Kari Hillstrom, 24, of Oceanside, who 
is expecting her first child in August. "It was so amazing; it was staggering." 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to reassure myself that this hypnosis stuff really works," said 
Carolyn Peterson, 42, a reading specialist for Fallbrook schools, who is 
expecting her second child. "Now I'm a believer." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Russell says the four-for-four success rate is not surprising, and she's 
thinking of adding fire walking as a regular feature of her class. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all a matter of increasing the frequency of your personal vibrations to 
direct your mind away from pain," she said. 
</P>
<P>
It may be a while before the American Medical Assn. adds fire walking to its 
prenatal suggestions. None of the four mothers-to-be dared tell their 
obstetricians in advance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Those Are Fighting Words 
</P>
<P>
The editor calls it "an unfortunate simile." 
</P>
<P>
The activist calls it "the most lowdown, degrading, awful thing I've seen in my 
50 years of politicking." She's talking to her lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is a punchy paragraph in the recent pre-election edition of the 
Residential Reporter, an intermittent publication of the Coronado Residential 
Assn. since 1954. Of Coronado City Council candidate Susan Keith, the Reporter 
reported: 
</P>
<P>
"In the minds of many people, Keith is 
</P>
<P>
associated with a small band of articulate, ultra-conservative citizens, whose 
inflammatory rhetoric and untempered accusations in and out of our council 
chambers mimic the antics we have come to expect from the children of the 
Ayatollah." 
</P>
<P>
Lula Coleman, a Keith supporter and longtime civic gadfly, says those are 
fighting words, and she's not pacified by the fact that Keith, a slow-growther, 
won a narrow victory last week over the candidate endorsed by the residential 
association. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't compare people to the Ayatollah and get away with it," she said. 
"What if my grandchildren read that?" 
</P>
<P>
Jane Winn, the editor, says the paragraph was trying to show how the activists 
who besiege Coronado City Hall and the demonstrators in Tehran both rev up 
their rhetoric when the press is present. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't meant in a political way," she said. "It was only meant to show they 
act alike when the cameras appear." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
News From the Front 
</P>
<P>
The guerrilla war against the SDG&amp;E sellout to Southern California Edison 
continues: 
</P>
<P>
* San Diego City Atty. John Witt was in Washington on Friday to brief the 
county's 
</P>
<P>
congressional delegation on the city's opposition to the merger. So far, the 
four local reps have stayed neutral, which they insist is unrelated to the fact 
that they've all received campaign contributions from either SDG&amp;E or 
Edison. 
</P>
<P>
* Encinitas Mayor Anne Omsted, a member of the San Diego County Water 
Authority, is wearing a "Being Sued by SDG&amp;E Is a Power Trip" T-shirt. On 
the front, an orange lightning bolt; on the back, a copy of the cover sheet of 
SDG&amp;E vs. County Water Authority. 
</P>
<P>
* Consumer advocate Michael Shames, who last week revealed an internal 
SDG&amp;E memo suggesting that rates may increase under Edison, has established 
a hot line for utility employees seeking to leak inside information: 270-7880.

ONE-SIDED RACE FOR MAYOR LEAVES A VOID ON ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY, Times City-County Bureau Chief 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the first weeks of the mayoral competition, the major questions facing Los 
Angeles have not been reflected in the one-sided campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The big-picture issues -- citywide growth, a gangs policy, economic disparity 
between affluent and poor -- are discussed in community meetings centered on 
neighborhood problems. And when candidates take a citywide view, the only 
people who hear them are those civic-minded few who attend the neighborhood 
forums. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the lack of television news coverage and of TV commercials -- 
those roundly condemned communications devices -- seems to have left a void. 
The campaign seems more like an election for City Council than for chief 
executive of the nation's second-most populous city. 
</P>
<P>
Simplistic and slanted as they can be, the commercials have the effect of 
dramatizing the issues to the electorate and presenting them in a citywide 
context. 
</P>
<P>
Thus the scenes of the election do not fit the city, this self-proclaimed 
Pacific Rim center, home of the entertainment business, working place of the 
most sophisticated mass communications experts, cutting edge capital of trend. 
</P>
<P>
With not a television camera in sight, for example, Mayor Tom Bradley opened 
his Crenshaw campaign headquarters in a storefront, packed with many of the 
same, loyal supporters who have been with him since he was a city councilman in 
the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
It was a revealing episode, but witnessed by only about 200. Bradley was not 
the stiff, formal character of most of his public appearances. Rather, he was 
relaxed, enjoying the comfortable surroundings, thoroughly a part of the 
middle-class black neighborhood where he had raised his family. 
</P>
<P>
Magnificent Montague, a famed black disc jockey, was master of ceremonies. The 
mayor recalled Montague's famous phrase, "Burn, Baby, Burn." 
</P>
<P>
"This was the hottest DJ in L.A.," the mayor said, standing on a small platform 
in a crowded room. "But after his slogan 'Burn, Baby, Burn' seared across the 
city and somehow had been associated with the Watts uprising . . . Montague 
decided he'd better move on." 
</P>
<P>
Here, where many of Bradley's generation refer to Watts, 1965, as the uprising 
rather than the riots, the mayor, with no high-powered electronic press corps 
recording him, spoke as if he shared their view of that historic event. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier that Saturday, in a small church hall in South-Central Los Angeles, the 
Equal Rights Congress, a community action group, held a forum for mayoral 
candidates for an audience of about 50. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley was not there. But some of the others were. Chevron oil worker Joel 
Britton, the Socialist Worker Party candidate, spoke. Perennial candidate 
Eileen Anderson sang "Danny Boy." 
</P>
<P>
So was former Los Angeles County Supervisor Baxter Ward, running without funds, 
who spends much of his time sitting at a typewriter in his San Fernando Valley 
home writing letters to council members and reporters with his campaign 
thoughts. He roundly condemned the major candidates for accepting campaign 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Nate Holden drove up to the hall alone. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a change," he said, after joining the others on stage. "We need it 
now. We all did support Tom Bradley, but 16 years is enough." 
</P>
<P>
The scene outside the church told of two big-picture problems, dwindling 
low-cost housing and the need for more schools for a growing immigrant 
population with many children. 
</P>
<P>
Signs on old Los Angeles bungalows, occupied by families who could lose their 
homes to construction of a badly needed elementary school, read: "Home Not For 
Sale." 
</P>
<P>
Gerry Silver of the Equal Rights Congress said the lack of a citywide debate on 
such issues is not good. "I think it is disappointing," she said of what, so 
far, seems to be an election without close competition. 
</P>
<P>
The city had been braced for a more competitive campaign, but Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky, the best-funded contender, dropped out after months of organizing 
and of voicing strong criticism of the Bradley Administration. 
</P>
<P>
After Yaroslavsky's withdrawal, Bradley, as he opened the campaign, indicated 
that the absence of intense competition could improve the quality of political 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
"Freed from narrow political concerns, we are free to see more clearly and to 
set directions that can take us far beyond the dead ends of political trench 
warfare," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He listed the issues he would discuss: gangs and drugs, day care, affordable 
housing, easing traffic congestion, and improving education. So far, he has not 
gone much beyond that speech. 
</P>
<P>
In his defense, Bradley aides said he has already announced a detailed traffic 
improvement program, begun shuttling city funds to day care and has proposed a 
program to use money from downtown development to build more housing that 
low-income people can afford. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley is strongly in favor of encouraging foreign investment in the city and 
has said those who express fear of too much Japanese investment are guilty of 
racism against Asians. 
</P>
<P>
Holden is a nationalist, reflecting the fears of some of his poorer black 
constituents that immigration and foreign investment is costing them jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Holden criticizes the Police Department's handling of gang violence and drugs. 
"If we had better support from the Police Department, the gangs would not be 
out of control," he told the community forum at the church. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley says it differently: "Los Angeles is ready -- to drive the gangs, their 
violence and drugs out of our community," he said in his campaign opener. "And 
together we will deploy a police force large enough to do the job." 
</P>
<P>
Holden, although short of money, is making plans to take his message citywide. 
He has opened headquarters on the Westside and in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley is expected to intensify his efforts. But he is also pursuing the 
traditional tactic of the heavily favored incumbent -- ignore the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, this is a campaign that may never leave the church halls and 
storefronts.

CULTURE CLASH OR ANIMAL CRUELTY?; 
</P>
<P>
TWO CAMBODIAN REFUGEES FACE TRIAL AFTER KILLING DOG FOR FOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These are the facts on which everyone agrees: 
</P>
<P>
Late last June, Sokheng Chea, 32, and Seng Ou, 33, both Cambodian refugees, 
decided to eat a 4-month-old German Shepherd puppy that a co-worker had given 
them as a pet. Holding the dog down on the kitchen floor of Ou's Long Beach 
apartment, they hit it over the head with a blunt instrument, slashed its 
throat and began skinning it. 
</P>
<P>
That is when the police arrived. Alerted by a neighbor who had heard the dog's 
yelps, they arrested the two men. And last week, Chea and Ou went on trial at 
Long Beach Municipal Court for misdemeanor cruelty to animals, an offense that 
carries a maximum penalty of a year in jail and a $2,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disagreement on Legality 
</P>
<P>
The only disagreement is over whether what they did is illegal. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution contends that the killing was a crime because it was carried 
out in an unnecessarily cruel way. 
</P>
<P>
The defense counters that the dog was killed humanely in a manner consistent 
with contemporary slaughterhouse practices, and that the two recent immigrants 
were following their own national customs with no idea that they were offending 
American sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Underlying everything, the lawyers agree, is a resounding clash of cultural 
values and a basic question: Just how much is America willing to bend to 
accommodate the new wave of immigrants who are daily arriving on its shores? 
</P>
<P>
"If the dog had been some other kind of animal -- like a chicken or a duck or a 
pig -- these people wouldn't be in court," said Joe Beason, an attorney 
representing Chea. "While (Americans) consider it completely acceptable to go 
out and shoot a deer, those same hunters would disapprove of killing a dog for 
food." 
</P>
<P>
Countered Sarah Lazarus, the prosecutor in the case: "We intend to prove that 
this was cruelty. It's cultural to the extent that each segment of our society 
has its own cultural customs, but some of (those customs) can be woven into the 
fabric of our society and others cannot." 
</P>
<P>
The court proceedings have been closely monitored by animal-rights activists. 
"We do not accept these things in our society, and we would hope that the court 
will deal with (these men) with the appropriate severity," said Jerye Mooney, 
coordinator of the Fund for Animals, a national organization based in Torrance 
that is pushing for legislation to specifically prohibit the killing of dogs 
and cats for human consumption. 
</P>
<P>
Similar legislation, inspired by reports that Southeast Asian refugees had been 
foraging for stray dogs and other animals in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, 
was defeated by an Assembly committee in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see these other cultures contained," said Sabina Hubbard, 
chairwoman of the Orange County chapter of the Pet Assistance Foundation. "We 
don't want these (practices) to spread." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Considered Delicacies 
</P>
<P>
Neither Chea, a custodian, nor Ou, who is unemployed, will comment until the 
case is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
According to local Asian leaders, dogs and cats are considered delicacies in 
some Southeast Asian countries. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, officials of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to 
Animals reported an increase in the number of dogs and cats being killed for 
food in Los Angeles County, a trend they attributed to the influx of Southeast 
Asian refugees. 
</P>
<P>
But Lazarus said that, to her knowledge, this is the first incident in which 
enough evidence existed to bring the matter to court. 
</P>
<P>
The trial -- which has already resulted in at least one death threat against 
the defendants -- has raised the hackles of some local Southeast Asian leaders 
who fear that the publicity may result in anti-Asian bias. "I am very 
concerned," said Vora H. Kanthoul, associate executive director of the United 
Cambodian Community, a social service agency based in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
While the eating of dogs is not uncommon in such countries as Korea, the 
Philippines and Vietnam, he said, it was highly unusual in Cambodia until the 
1970s, when people there were near starvation during the regime of Pol Pot, a 
brutal Communist dictator. "During the war, a lot of things happened and they 
ate anything to survive," Kanthoul said. "It's unfortunate that (these men) 
were caught because it's blown everything out of proportion." 
</P>
<P>
Responding to a pretrial motion last week, Judge Bradford L. Andrews ruled that 
killing a dog for food is not in itself a violation of the law. To win its 
case, therefore, he said, the prosecution must prove that the dog was "maimed, 
wounded, tortured, mutilated or tormented" in a manner beyond that required to 
prepare it as food. 
</P>
<P>
Lazarus said that as the trial progresses, she intends to produce an eyewitness 
and a veterinarian who will testify that the dog was killed with unnecessary 
cruelty. 
</P>
<P>
Beason says he has an autopsy report indicating that the killing was done in a 
manner consistent with livestock slaughter techniques and that there is no 
direct evidence of inhumane treatment. 
</P>
<P>
As for the cultural issue, both say it will ultimately have to be resolved out 
of court. "When you bring someone into this country, you take the whole 
person," Beason said. "You don't just extract them from their culture, you 
bring the culture with them."

ACTIVISTS BLAME BRADLEY, COUNCIL, CRA FOR L.A. ILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL STEWART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 800 community leaders and neighborhood activists on Sunday assailed 
the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency, Mayor Tom Bradley and the City 
Council for pursuing policies they say are turning Los Angeles into an 
increasingly polarized city of "haves and have-nots." 
</P>
<P>
The activists, representing scores of groups ranging from Concerned Citizens of 
South Central Los Angeles to the Westwood-based Not Yet New York, put forth a 
platform of proposals to take power away from the CRA, begin economic 
rebuilding in depressed areas, reform city land-use policies and limit elected 
officials to two terms in office. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to remake this city, you are certainly not going to do it with the 
present set-up downtown," Barbara Blinderman, an attorney and member of Not Yet 
New York, told a cheering crowd at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Participants at the two-day gathering organized by the L.A. Weekly newspaper 
and the Minority Assn. of Planners and Architects, were told by Deputy Mayor 
Mike Gage on Saturday that the city will sponsor a three-day conference to 
continue the discussions begun by the activists over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
However, Gage proposed that it be held after the mayoral election April 11. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Failings in South-Central 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of speakers on Sunday decried the city's failure -- and Bradley's low 
profile -- in bringing economic development, new jobs and affordable housing to 
South-Central Los Angeles and other depressed areas that were hit hard by plant 
closures and a citywide move away from heavy manufacturing in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Robin Cannon, president of Concerned Citizens of South Central, said that while 
the media focuses almost exclusively on gang troubles in the black community, 
there are far more destructive forces at work. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides facing the eminent domain powers of the school district, which wants 
to tear down an entire neighborhood for a school, we are under siege by the CRA 
and by the University of Southern California, both of whom want to expand at 
our expense," Cannon said. "Banks have accepted our savings deposits but refuse 
to make us home improvement loans, and invest the money elsewhere. The city has 
done nothing to stop it." 
</P>
<P>
Gage, who spoke on Saturday along with officials invited from Boston and 
Toronto, defended Bradley's policies and said elected leaders have "done a good 
job" responding to the city's vast challenges of homelessness, growth and 
downtown revitalization. 
</P>
<P>
However, Gage conceded that far more intensive efforts are required if the city 
is to follow more innovative cities -- notably Boston and Toronto -- that are 
well ahead in tackling urban crises. 
</P>
<P>
However, many who heard comments from Gage on Saturday, and from CRA Board 
Chairman James Wood on Sunday, said the city has already proved it is on the 
wrong track. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Erlenbusch, of a group known as the Campaign for Critical Needs, noted that 
Los Angeles has one of the worst housing affordability problems in the country, 
a sewage-polluted bay, intractable smog and growing traffic ills. 
</P>
<P>
"What we really need is a new mayor," Erlenbusch said. "He and other elected 
officials are hopelessly out of touch with what is happening in this city, and 
that is part of the reason 1,000 people showed up here this weekend."

HUNTINGTON BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
MAN BELIEVED DROWNED IN RIPTIDE NEAR PIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Huntington Beach officials said Sunday that they have not found the body of a 
22-year-old man who disappeared while swimming in the ocean Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe that he has drowned. 
</P>
<P>
The man's identity has not been made public, but lifeguards said Saturday he 
was from Mexico City and visiting friends in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
According to Huntington City Beach lifeguards, the swimmer was last seen at 
11:37 a.m. Saturday in the water near Lake Street and Pacific Coast Highway, 
about 200 yards south of the Huntington Beach Pier. 
</P>
<P>
A riptide was reportedly running near the shore about the time the man 
disappeared, lifeguards said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Patrols were on the lookout all day but found no trace of the man, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Another Mexico City visitor, Juan Manuel Ordones, 17, also disappeared in the 
surf near the same area on Feb. 24. His body has not been found.

VICTIM OF FATAL SHOOTING HAD JUST ATTENDED PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Anaheim man with a gunshot wound to his head was found dead on a sidewalk in 
Stanton early Sunday, shortly after he had attended a party in the area, county 
sheriff's spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
David Wayne Hanuska, 27, was found about 12:45 a.m. on the south side of 
Katella Avenue, about 30 feet east of Cedar Street, Sgt. Steve Wesson said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies had been dispatched to the area after receiving a report of an 
"unknown type of disturbance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Several bullet holes were found in a nearby building, Wesson said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim had attended a party nearby earlier in the evening. Investigators 
are trying to determine whether "any connection exists," he said. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy Sunday determined that Hanuska died of a gunshot wound to the head, 
according to a Sheriff's Department spokesman.

The creation of three new superconducting ceramics suggests that a whole new 
class of materials could overcome some of the problems associated with finding 
the perfect electrical conductor, a UC San Diego physicist said last week. 
Unlike more conventional superconducting metals that transmit current through 
so-called "electron holes," the new ceramics use extra electrons to carry 
electrical current, said M. Brian Maple. 
</P>
<P>
The new materials could be a precursor to superconductors -- materials that 
carry electricity with no losses due to resistance -- that operate at higher 
temperatures and do not need costly coolants, said Maple. His team is the first 
in the United States to make the new ceramics. The new materials could 
"overcome some of the problems associated with previously known 
superconductors, such as low amounts of electrical current. Materials 
discovered within this category may be able to carry more current than existing 
materials," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The new materials involve combinations of copper oxide with rare earth elements 
such as praseodymium, neodymium or europium and small amounts of either cerium 
or thorium.

ANSWERS FROM ANTIQUITY; 
</P>
<P>
A SCHOLAR AND A SCIENTIST COMBED THROUGH ANCIENT SCROLLS THAT RESULTED IN NEW 
FINDINGS ABOUT EARTH'S ROTATION AND THE DAWN OF CHINESE CIVILIZATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ASHLEY DUNN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Buried deep in an ancient Chinese book called "The Bamboo Annals" is a passage 
about an unusual double dawn nearly 2,900 years ago: "In the first year of the 
reign of King Yi, in the first month of spring, the sun rose twice in Zheng." 
</P>
<P>
The passage describes what is believed to be a solar eclipse viewed in the 9th 
Century BC from the now-dead city of Zheng. 
</P>
<P>
For centuries, scholars have seen this terse report as a strange but minor part 
of the annals, an ancient history book discovered by grave robbers 1,700 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
But from this passage, Chou Hung-hsiang, a professor of Chinese at UCLA, and 
astronomer Kevin D. Pang of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory launched an unusual 
two-year search that has led to a series of findings about the Earth's rotation 
and the dawn of Chinese civilization. 
</P>
<P>
By matching Chinese astronomical records dating back 3,900 years with computer 
simulations of the movements of the Earth and moon, they have determined the 
rate of the planet's gradually slowing rotation within thousandths of a second. 
</P>
<P>
Their report was published recently in the British journal Vistas in Astronomy. 
While other researchers have done similar studies using Arabian and Babylonian 
eclipse records, none have been able to go as far back into history as Chou and 
Pang. 
</P>
<P>
According to their research, the length of a day was 22-thousandths of a second 
shorter in AD 532, 42-thousandths of a second shorter in 899 BC, and 
70-thousandths of a second shorter in 1876 BC. 
</P>
<P>
Using the same method, the two researchers believe they also have established 
or confirmed the dates of several events in Chinese history. 
</P>
<P>
Their research focused on the period when China was divided into the Shang, 
Zhou and Xia kingdoms, known collectively as the Three Dynasties. Scholars have 
never been able to determine the exact time of their rule and many question 
whether the Xia Dynasty even existed. 
</P>
<P>
But by matching astronomical records with historical accounts, Chou and Pang 
believe they have determined the reign of several rulers in the Three Dynasties 
period and the beginning of the legendary Xia Dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
Chou and Pang began their search after hearing about research to determine the 
planet's rotational speed using Arabian and Babylonian eclipse records. 
</P>
<P>
They knew the same could be done with Chinese accounts, and that it would take 
the research much further back into the past. 
</P>
<P>
Out of thousands of eclipses recorded over the centuries, they chose three that 
fell outside of the years covered by Arabian and Babylonian accounts. 
</P>
<P>
The first step was to determine an approximate date for the eclipses, since 
there are no recorded dates in Chinese history before 841 BC. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the double dawn, the task was easy, since King Yi was only two 
generations removed from that time. By assigning 30 years for each generation, 
they estimated the first year of King Yi's reign to be around 901 BC. 
</P>
<P>
By using JPL's computers, they simulated the movement of the Earth and moon 
backward through time toward the double dawn. 
</P>
<P>
While they found hundreds of eclipses within a century of that date, there was 
only one, which occurred on April 21, 899 BC, whose path was in line with the 
city of Zheng. 
</P>
<P>
"You could go forward 2,000 years and backward 2,000 years and you wouldn't 
find another one," Pang said. 
</P>
<P>
There was one problem: If they assumed each day was exactly 24 hours, the 
eclipse should have occurred 5 hours and 48 minutes later and would have been 
seen in the Middle East instead of China. 
</P>
<P>
The discrepancy was caused by a phenomenon that astronomers have long known 
about: that each day, in fact, is not exactly 24 hours long. Because of 
atmospheric friction, tidal action and the movement of molten rock in the 
Earth's core, the planet's rotation has been gradually slowing, meaning that 
days were slightly shorter in the past. 
</P>
<P>
To put the eclipse over Zheng 2,900 years ago, Chou and Pang calculated that a 
day had to have been 42-thousandths of a second shorter than today. 
</P>
<P>
Using the same method, Chou and Pang analyzed an eclipse recorded in the 
1,400-year-old History of the Northern Wei Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first year of the tai-chang reign period (of the reign of King Chu), on 
the day xin-you (the 58th day in a 60-day cycle), or the first day of the 10th 
lunar month, the sun from beneath the Earth eclipsed and began to wane from the 
southwestern horn." 
</P>
<P>
They set the date of the eclipse at Nov. 13, AD 532, and calculated that the 
length of the day was 22-thousandths of a second shorter than today. 
</P>
<P>
The final eclipse that Chou and Pang studied is the oldest recorded in Chinese 
history. 
</P>
<P>
According to the 6th Century BC "Book of Documents," a compilation of 
historical treatises on the Xia, Shang and Zhou dynasties, the eclipse took 
place during the fifth year of the reign of King Zhong Kang, the fourth king of 
the Xia Dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
"On the first day of the last month of autumn, the sun and the moon did not 
meet harmoniously in fang (the fourth lunar mansion). The blind musicians beat 
their drums and the lower-ranked officers and common people bustled and ran 
about." 
</P>
<P>
The passage provided several important clues. The eclipse was seen in a part of 
the sky known as fang, which roughly corresponds to the location of the 
constellation Scorpio. It was viewed in the last month of autumn, which in the 
Xia calendar is the same as modern month of October. 
</P>
<P>
The computer again found hundreds of possible eclipses within a few centuries 
of the estimated date of King Zhong Kang's reign. 
</P>
<P>
But only one was visible from China during October and located exactly in the 
fourth lunar mansion of fang. "It satisfied all the criteria," Pang said. "It 
was the only one possible." 
</P>
<P>
Pang and Chou set the date of the eclipse at Oct. 16, 1876 BC, which would put 
the beginning of King Zhong Kang's reign in the year 1881 BC. 
</P>
<P>
There are no other eclipses recorded before King Zhong Kang's time, but there 
was an unusual clustering of planets that allowed Chou and Pang to journey even 
further back in history to the origins of the Xia Dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
The five-planet conjunction, described in the Gu Wei Shu, a 2nd Century BC 
compilation of astronomical writings, was of one of the most spectacular in 
recorded history. 
</P>
<P>
"During the reign of King Yu (first king of the Xia Dynasty), five planets 
lined up clearly like a string of pearls, brightly burning like joined jade 
disks." 
</P>
<P>
Chou and Pang ran a computer simulation of planetary orbits back through time 
and found that Jupiter, Venus, Mercury, Mars and Saturn did indeed cluster in 
the sky above the Xia capital of Yangcheng on Feb. 23, 1953 BC. 
</P>
<P>
"It has never been that close and never in that straight a line," Pang said. 
"You could put your thumb up and it would block them out." 
</P>
<P>
Their simulation matched a previously published report by David W. Pankenier, 
assistant professor of Chinese at Lehigh University, that proposed 1953 BC as 
the beginning of the Xia Dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be very exciting if we finally know the beginning of Chinese 
civilization," said K. C. Chang, professor of Chinese archeology at Harvard 
University. "Their findings are of great interest." 
</P>
<P>
Chou and Pang believe they will be able to date a few more points in the 
chronology of the Three Dynasties using other Chinese accounts of astronomical 
events. 
</P>
<P>
Pankenier has already used a similar technique to date two other planetary 
conjunctions that he believes establishes the fall of the Shang Dynasty shortly 
after 1059 BC and the end of the Xia Dynasty around 1576 BC. 
</P>
<P>
But modern researchers are far from unanimous in accepting any of these dates. 
</P>
<P>
David S. Nivison, a retired professor of Chinese philosophy at Stanford 
University and an expert on the chronology of the Three Dynasties, said that 
using ancient Chinese texts is fraught with problems. 
</P>
<P>
Erroneous words have been copied into the texts, events have been distorted for 
symbolic purposes, and efforts by ancient historians to reconstruct the past 
have created gross errors. 
</P>
<P>
Compounding this problem is that most historians have only a limited 
understanding of astronomy, and most astronomers have little skill in wading 
through the complexities of ancient texts. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the problems, Nivison and others say that using modern astronomical 
techniques to date the past holds enormous promise and, except for the 
discovery of new archeological finds, may be the only way to recover the 
long-lost chronology of the Three Dynasties. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is going to be a lot more agreement in the future over dates 
because of the use of scientific methods," Nivison said. "But don't 
underestimate the ability of scholars to argue and argue and argue."

KILLER BEES BUZZ DIFFERENTLY

<P>
How can you tell a killer bee from any other bee? By its buzz, according to 
researchers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tenn. Scientists 
Howard T. Kerr and Michael E. Buchanan have developed killer-bee detectors, 
solving a problem that has worried farmers and beekeepers watching the bees' 
advance to the Rio Grande. It has been difficult to distinguish the so-called 
killer bees from others until a swarm suddenly turns aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
But killer bees beat their wings at a different frequency than the common 
European honey bees, and thus their hum is different. Using noise analysis 
techniques developed to detect problems in nuclear reactors, the researchers 
have built portable devices that can hear killer bees coming and sound an 
alarm. 
</P>
<P>
The killer bees are called africanized bees by entomologists because they 
resulted from an accidental cross between African queen bees and European honey 
bees when some African queens escaped from a laboratory in Brazil in the 1950s. 
The africanized bees are good honey producers but are very aggressive when 
disturbed and sometimes launch swarming attacks on people and animals.

BIRDS LEAD AFRICANS TO HONEY

<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists have confirmed Africans' claim that special birds guide them to wild 
honey, debunking those who regarded the man-bird teamwork as myth, a new study 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 20,000 years, people living from the central Sahara to South 
Africa have collected wild honey, and even today, honey is a staple in the 
diets of many nomadic tribes. Africans have long reported that a bird called 
the greater honeyguide deliberately leads them to bee hives in hollow trees, 
rock crevices or termite mounds. 
</P>
<P>
But because of the folksy nature of such claims, "many consider this 
interaction to be a myth," said two researchers, whose study of the 
honeyguide's relationship with Kenya's Boran people was published in the 
journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
After three years of tracking Borans in their pursuit of honey, H.A. Isack of 
the National Museum of Kenya and H.U. Reyer of West Germamy's Max Planck 
Institute, found following the birds substantially reduced how long it took to 
find honey. 
</P>
<P>
"In unfamiliar areas, their (Borans') search time per bees' nest was, on 
average, 8.9 hours when not guided and 3.2 hours when guided," the 
ornithologists said.

FORMER TITAN PLAYER JOINS FOOTBALL'S DREAM TEAM; 
</P>
<P>
HOPING FOR A BIG BREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Quinton Knight has wanted to be a professional football player since his Pop 
Warner days. 
</P>
<P>
The dream became even stronger when he entered Clearwater High School in 
Clearwater, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Knight was part of a Clearwater team that included Hassan Jones, now with the 
Minnesota Vikings, and Ron Moten, a sixth-round draft pick of the Philadelphia 
Eagles in 1987. They had grown up together, hung out together and helped each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
"Our senior year, my girlfriend became ill, so I wasn't going to the prom," 
Knight said. "Hassan and Ron called me up and said, 'You've paid for the suit, 
you have your ticket, you're going.' We had a great night." 
</P>
<P>
Later that spring, Jones signed a letter of intent with Florida State. Moten 
chose the University of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Because of poor grades, Knight couldn't get into a university. Instead, Knight 
traveled to California and enrolled at Pasadena City College. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I couldn't play at a big university like Hassan and Ron, the next best 
thing was to meet them in the pros," Knight said. "I told the guys I'd meet 
them at the top." 
</P>
<P>
Knight, who played one year at Cal State Fullerton and another with an Arena 
Football team in New York, still is trying to make that climb. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Knight was among more than 200 hopefuls with similar dreams who 
turned out at UC Irvine for the sixth annual Pro Football Search, a daylong 
tryout session. 
</P>
<P>
The camp is run by Tim Leedom. For $70, former college players were run through 
their paces while about 10 scouts from National Football League and Canadian 
Football League teams looked on. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good opportunity for me to see where I am with my training," said 
Knight, 25, who lives in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Attired in a New York Knight sweat suit and packing a pair of cleats, a jump 
rope and a container of Ben-Gay, he was hoping to catch the eye of a scout. 
</P>
<P>
Any scout. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a great opportunity for a player to get exposure," said Leedom, 
president and chief operator of the Irvine tryout. "There are around 1,500 jobs 
for (professional players) and only 250 or so open up each year. Any exposure 
helps." 
</P>
<P>
Linemen were in the minority at the tryout. Most of the would-be players were 
quarterbacks, running backs and wide receivers in college. 
</P>
<P>
It was hardly unusual considering the drills used are designed to judge speed, 
quickness and agility. Not exactly things associated with linemen. 
</P>
<P>
Knight, with the number No. 771 pinned to his shirt, lined up for his turn in 
the 40-yard dash. He came out of a three-point stance, arms pumping, muscles 
straining, face contorted, demanding the most out of his body. After four 
steps, he was at full speed. 
</P>
<P>
"Needs to lose some of that fat," one scout said. 
</P>
<P>
Scouts weren't there to judge heart. 
</P>
<P>
At 260 pounds, Knight has the bulk to play on the defensive line. But at 6-0, 
he is considerably shorter than what National Football League teams are looking 
for in a pass rusher. 
</P>
<P>
"I see guys who are 6-foot-8, 280 pounds getting drafted, but they don't have 
the heart," Knight said. "I have the heart. I know I'm not the stereotype 
defensive lineman. But if I get a chance, I can prove that I can play." 
</P>
<P>
He had heard that the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League were in 
need of defensive linemen. So Knight viewed Saturday as almost a private 
tryout. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not here to work out with these other guys," Knight said. "Ray Newman is 
here to look at me." 
</P>
<P>
Newman has been a scout for the Eskimos for the last 11 years. He is in charge 
of scouting players in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Newman said that 95% of the players he signs have at least experienced an NFL 
camp. It's something that Knight doesn't have on his resume. 
</P>
<P>
After playing two years at Pasadena and another at Sam Houston State, he 
transferred to Fullerton and was a redshirt. 
</P>
<P>
"It was tough that first year with no scholarship," Knight said. "You always 
like to know where your next meal is coming from." 
</P>
<P>
But his play in practice was impressive enough to earn a scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"Quinton had about nine jobs that first year," Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy 
said. "He was really working hard -- at jobs, in practice and in school. We had 
to put him on scholarship." 
</P>
<P>
Knight, playing nose guard, led the Titans with nine sacks in 1986. He also had 
57 tackles, despite numerous nagging injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The next spring, Knight left school a semester short of graduating and signed a 
contract with the Toronto Argonauts of the CFL. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to a tryout session in Detroit and they really liked me and signed me 
to a two-year deal," Knight said. "Two days before I was to leave, they called 
and said that they had oversigned and I was released. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know nothing about agents or things like that. I had just signed a 
professional contract and didn't know the terms. My girlfriend and I were just 
getting things together and Toronto messed everything up." 
</P>
<P>
When the Arena Football league was formed, Knight expected to be protected as a 
regional draft pick by the Los Angeles Cobras. But the Cobras left him 
unprotected. 
</P>
<P>
"That really made me mad," Knight said. "So I went to the league tryout session 
to show them they were wrong. During the one-on-one drills, I destroyed 
everybody." 
</P>
<P>
He was the first lineman drafted by the Knights and ended up second in the 
league in sacks. 
</P>
<P>
And he led the league in flamboyancy. 
</P>
<P>
After each sack, Knight would go into his act, dancing over the quarterback, 
pointing his fingers as if they were guns and aiming at his victim. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like the Wild West," Knight said. "You're either dead or alive, no in 
between. Well, you were either standing or laying on the ground." 
</P>
<P>
Arena Football suspended operations for a year, leaving Knight with a wife, a 
3-year-old daughter and no job. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to pay the bills and take care of your responsibilities," he said. 
"There's a lot of stress in any relationship. You have to understand what is 
expected of you, otherwise things can fall apart." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing has fallen apart for Knight, yet. But things aren't going well either. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's just say I'm still married and leave it at that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Knight said that he intends to return to Fullerton to complete his degree. He 
was a criminal justice major, with hopes of becoming a police detective. 
</P>
<P>
"I've worked 9-to-5 jobs, there's got to be something better in life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Like football. 
</P>
<P>
He plans to attend a San Diego Charger tryout on 
</P>
<P>
March 27. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Quinton has an advantage because he played Arena Football," Leedom 
said. "There's a green door. Those who have had professional experience are 
inside. Those who don't are outside." 
</P>
<P>
Knight spent the morning at Irvine waiting for his turn. The time gave him a 
chance to reminisce with friends he hadn't seen in a while. 
</P>
<P>
He talked with Cliff Madison, a quarterback who also played at Pasadena, and a 
couple of former Fullerton players. He also talked with friends he has met at 
other camps. 
</P>
<P>
They have a common bond: to get noticed. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a fine line between desire and obsession," Leedom said. "I had this 
one guy from Vancouver call me Friday to ask about the tryouts. I told him to 
fly into Orange County airport because it was close to UC Irvine. He said he 
was driving. He spent 16 hours in a car and got here at 4 a.m." 
</P>
<P>
For some, it's hard to know when to quit. They travel from tryout to tryout, 
hoping that sometime, somewhere, they'll get the big break. 
</P>
<P>
"There's this one guy who shows up every year from New York," said former NFL 
player and coach Tom Fears, an Irvine tryout official. "He's intelligent, but 
has no talent. I don't know why he keeps coming. It's nice to see him, but 
there comes a point when you have to wonder about some of these guys." 
</P>
<P>
Knight said he will never reach that point and will quit before that day comes. 
</P>
<P>
"In my heart, I'll know when it's over," Knight said. "My heart deals with 
reality." 
</P>
<P>
His head handles the dreams.

PLAYOFF MISMATCHES RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT QUALIFYING FORMAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Donna Carter 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Does the state basketball playoff format have problems? If any doubt remained, 
the first round of the Southern California Regional Division III boys' playoffs 
should have ended the discussion. 
</P>
<P>
Tulare Western, which finished the season 9-16, qualified for the regionals, 
where it lost to Corona del Mar, 80-47. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar Coach Paul Orris, whose team was an at-large selection, cleared 
his bench in the third quarter of a game that provided more competition than a 
bye, but not by much. 
</P>
<P>
"After the game, (Tulare Western Coach Mark Siverly) said to me, 'If we had 
played the first half like we did the second, we might have been able to give 
you a pretty good contest,' " Orris said. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know what to respond to him. We just beat them by 33 points and 
played everybody equally in the second half. We scored 21, 19, 20, 20 and that 
was really with the second and third string playing most of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not trying to put him down. I just don't think he is aware of the caliber 
of basketball around here . . . it's just the nature of the beast. There is a 
pretty high level of basketball in the Los Angeles and Orange County area, and 
some good coaching. It is unfortunate they had to come that far to get buried. 
It was not our intention to embarrass them, and I don't think we did." 
</P>
<P>
Monache, of the Central Section, also was given an opportunity to compete for 
the state title in the boys' division with a losing record. Monache was 12-14. 
</P>
<P>
Monache lost, 78-37, to Dominguez (25-4) of the Southern Section in a 
first-round Division II game. 
</P>
<P>
What these scores demonstrate is an amazing lack of parity among the sections. 
Consider that of the 10 state final berths available -- five boys', five girls' 
-- eight were taken by Southern Section teams. 
</P>
<P>
In the first round of the regionals, the average margin of victory was 14.9 
points for boys' games and 20.1 for girls'. In Division III, that figure jumped 
to 22.8 in the boys' and girls' divisions. 
</P>
<P>
So, how did Tulare Western, a team that lost almost twice as many games as it 
won, earn a berth in the Southern California Regionals while players for 
Rolling Hills (22-5), the top-seeded boys' team in the Southern Section 3-A, 
were turning in their uniforms after losing in the quarterfinal round? 
</P>
<P>
According to Jim Cheffers, the Southern California tournament director for the 
California Interscholastic Federation, the Southern, San Diego and Central 
sections each were allowed two entries in each division with the section 
champion automatically earning one berth. 
</P>
<P>
Tulare Western was the Central Section runner-up in the Division III playoffs. 
But only six teams fell into that enrollment category (1,000-1,499) in the 
Central Section, said Merritt Gilbert, the section's commissioner. That means 
the Central Section, with only six schools, got the same number of playoff 
entries in Division III as the Southern Section, which has 70 Division III 
schools, many of them with basketball teams with records far superior to 
Central Section teams. 
</P>
<P>
In defense of Tulare Western's record, Gilbert said that because there are so 
few Division III schools in the Central Section, the school competes in a 
league made up of Division I teams. But Tulare Western lost the sectional title 
game by almost 30 points. 
</P>
<P>
The two at-large berths in the Southern California Regional Division III 
playoff bracket went to Southern Section teams Corona del Mar and San Luis 
Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very pleased that they took our two at-large," said Dean Crowley, 
Southern Section associate commissioner. "We hope they did it because they were 
quality teams. It was also important that we got consideration due to the 
number of schools in that division in our section and because of the quality of 
our teams." 
</P>
<P>
That is still little consolation for a team such as Rolling Hills, which sees a 
Tulare Western playing in the regionals. 
</P>
<P>
Said Corona del Mar's Orris: "I feel not so badly for ourselves as for teams 
like Rolling Hills, for instance, who we beat in the quarterfinals (of the 
Southern Section 3-A) who had an outstanding team and really deserves to be in 
the state playoff much more so than Tulare Western, but that is the way the 
ball bounces. To make it to state as it is set up right now, you have to be at 
least a finalist in your section. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how you can get around it unless you rewrite the rules. If you 
don't go by (the top two) teams from various regions and go by a ranking 
process, then a lot of politics get into it. It is hard to evaluate a team from 
Orange County against a team from San Diego unless they have some common 
competition." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the way to go is to just have each section's champion advance. The 
playoff format would be very simple. You win, you advance. You lose, you go 
home. It also would prevent teams which lose their sectional finals from 
getting into the state tournament and winning a state title. 
</P>
<P>
Crowley of the Southern Section has another idea. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are going to have state championships, let's have the best possible 
teams there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe the answer is that section champions get in and then after that, the 
committee selects the best possible teams to fill the brackets. Why an 11-14 
team? Why a 9-16 team? Take the sectional champs, then fill the bracket with 
the best possible teams. I would support that totally." 
</P>
<P>
A shot in the arm: Chanele Chambrone, a first-team All-Southern Section catcher 
and one of the leading hitters in Orange County last season, has transferred 
from Tustin High School to Canyon, Canyon softball Coach Lance Eddy said. 
</P>
<P>
Chambrone, who hit .520 as a junior last season, enrolled at Canyon Friday. Her 
family has moved into the area, Eddy said. 
</P>
<P>
"Chanele is versatile and can play first and third as well as catcher, and I'm 
not sure where she will fit into the lineup," said Eddy, whose team went 18-9 
and finished second in the Century League last season. 
</P>
<P>
Joe-Max Moore, who helped lead Mission Viejo High School to the Southern 
Section 3-A boys' soccer championship, will join some of the top high school 
senior soccer players in Southern California at the High School Soccer All-Star 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
The games are Friday at La Mirada High School at 7 and 8:45 p.m. Admission is 
$3. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve of the 18 participants are from Orange County. They are Dean Miller 
(Troy), Moore and Todd Patrick (Mission Viejo), Diego Abbes (Kennedy), Eddie 
Buenrostro (Santa Ana), Chris Stempson (Valencia), Carlos A. Zavala 
(Saddleback), J.R. Ochs (Brea), Darin Martinez (Esperanza), Daniel Barber and 
Tim Stevenson (Pacifica) and Bill Kline (Marina).

STANLEY JORDAN DAZZLES COACH HOUSE IN TRIPLICATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Guitarist Stanley Jordan created a sensation a few years back when he 
introduced the two-handed tap technique that creates the sound of two or even 
three guitars played simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
Fears generated by the pop overtones of his latest album, "Flying Home," were 
allayed Friday at the Coach House, as Jordan dazzled a capacity house with his 
sleight-of-hand and his rhythmic finesse. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, who brought in Yossi Fine on bass and Cody Moffett on drums, is still 
his own best accompanist. Dismissing the sidemen to play Henry Mancini's "Moon 
River," the guitarist hit lush chords with one hand while adding racy 
embellishments with the other. His solo (sometimes played with only one hand) 
was peppered with dissonance and dynamic twists. 
</P>
<P>
A plucky, up-tempo "Autumn Leaves" showed that Jordan's hands, by themselves, 
can match the empathy shown by such established guitar duos as Ralph Towner and 
John Abercrombie. The sheer amount of sound he pulls from a single instrument 
is amazing, especially considering his relaxed, seemingly effortless style. 
</P>
<P>
But Jordan was not satisfied playing just a single guitar. Backed by Fine and 
Moffett, he plucked rhythm with his left hand on a guitar hung from his 
shoulders while hammering out lead on a second guitar supported on a stand. 
This kind of double dexterity has not been seen since Roland Kirk wedged a 
couple (or more) of saxophones in his mouth and became an entire horn section. 
</P>
<P>
A long introduction to his own "Return Expedition" found Jordan on a third 
guitar, this one wired into a stack of electronic equipment. From it, he coaxed 
vibraphone tones, re-created a string section, then struck a melange of pipe 
organ chords before moving into an aggressive solo above the pace set by 
Moffett's ride cymbal. Fine, who played with deep, clean tones, kept the groove 
from becoming redundant. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, always known for playing a wide variety of music, closed with the Led 
Zeppelin warhorse "Stairway to Heaven," a tune perfectly suited for the 
guitarist's two-handed counterpoint. But, as happens on some of the soft 
rockers from the recent album, he seems to figure less and less in the 
proceedings as the volume of the song increases. 
</P>
<P>
His encore, "The Music's Gonna Change," continued the trend, with Moffett's 
surly back-beat and thunder-thumb rumblings from Fine, leaving us wishing for 
more Stanley Jordan -- alone with his three guitars.

EXHIBITION PROVES THAT SIMPLE IMAGES CAN BE SIMPLY SIMPLE-MINDED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When do objects in a work of art convincingly symbolize a "deeper" meaning? How 
can we tell? Must we take the artist's -- or someone else's -- word for it? 
These questions bedevil an exhibition of paintings and pastel drawings by 
Sheila Lichacz at the UC Irvine Fine Arts Gallery through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Lichacz, 46, was born in Panama and lives in Newport Beach. Her constant 
subject is the simple clay pot, shown either individually or clustered 
together. The artist carefully grades the surface of each pot from light to 
dark to give the illusion of roundness. She dwells on the blackness of each 
pot's opening. 
</P>
<P>
But when you look carefully at the paintings, you realize how improbable a 
vision Lichacz offers. Unlike real pots, the edges of these vessels appear to 
be flattened out. When they are clustered together, it is impossible to 
conceive how their unseen sides could occupy such a limited amount of space. 
Along with their flat, undefined backgrounds, the pots seem to be part of an 
airless, unreal world. 
</P>
<P>
Well, OK. That's poetic license (assuming the spatial peculiarities don't 
represent a deficiency of skill). But there's more. 
</P>
<P>
The titles of the works generally have religious references ("All Saints Day," 
"And I Will Raise Him Up," "Notre Dame," "Ascension"). These titles are, of 
course, clues to the artist's intent. But a long road stretches between intent 
and realization, and ultimately we are not obliged to interpret her works as 
she does. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, there are untold problems in trying to make religious art in our 
wonderfully splintered society. We have few universally identifiable symbols 
(as opposed to the rich lode available to Christendom during the Renaissance) 
and inventing new ones is incredibly difficult to do with any success. The 
pitfalls are obvious: triteness, sentimentality, unintelligibility. 
</P>
<P>
Lichacz's work depends on the viewer reading spiritual meaning into images of 
pots. Because clay vessels inspire no such feelings in themselves, she is 
obliged to try to invest them with a mythical quality by manipulating color and 
form. 
</P>
<P>
For gallery director Melinda Wortz, who wrote the wall labels, these images are 
practically seething with meaning -- although more broadly humanistic than 
specifically religious in nature. Describing "All Saints Day," she calls the 
pots' dark openings "open mouths waiting to be filled." "Notre Dame," she 
writes, allows us to "intuit . . . both the vibrational essence of the universe 
and the vividness of actuality." 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, all this is not unlike a Rorschach test: You see an angry face; I 
see a bird; someone else just sees an ink blot. But Lichacz's imagery seems far 
too banal to carry the heavy freight of interpretation that Wortz would impose 
on it (some of which is, in any case, little more than meaningless psychobabble 
-- "the energy of being and becoming" -- or dogmatic prescriptions for the 
universe: "an important metaphor for our time, which needs to embrace the needs 
of all living beings"). 
</P>
<P>
Sorry, but I just don't buy the cosmic significance of a painting that shows 
three big blue-white pots positioned in different ways -- and is called 
"Trinity." Or of a white shell spilling out a group of pots in graduated sizes, 
and called "The Birth of Life." 
</P>
<P>
We in the modern era have been brainwashed with the idea that less is more, 
that simple images can pack a big aesthetic wallop. But although some simple 
images are immense in their scope, others are just simple-minded. 
</P>
<P>
"All Saints Day" -- a view from above of numerous pots jostled together against 
a dark background -- does suggest the notion of a community of individuals. But 
the distance between Lichacz's painting and the similarly anthropomorphic 
approach of, say, sculptor Louise Bourgeois is very far indeed. 
</P>
<P>
With her colonies of abstract forms, Bourgeois creates objects that evoke -- by 
means of their meticulous size, scale and placement -- the minute differences 
in the postures of a crowd of people. Lichacz settles for a decorative panorama 
of pots tilting this way and that. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't enough to paint an image that superficially stands in for some higher 
idea; the difference between banal and inspiring religious art depends on the 
extent to which the work reveals the deepest, most resonant aspect of the 
religious experience. Three objects may "represent" the Trinity in a bald way, 
but they utterly fail to create a personal approach to the myriad associations 
that revolve around God, Christ and the Holy Ghost. 
</P>
<P>
By playing more adeptly with scale, Lichacz creates a somewhat more memorable 
image in "And I Will Raise Him Up," in which a monumental grayish pot seems to 
float in a black void above a curious landscape paved with small, regularly 
sized rocks. There is a genuine air of mystery that might be seen to correspond 
in some way with the Resurrection. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the artist appears far too complacent about a kind of art that is 
fiendishly difficult to do well, particularly in the context of 
late-20th-Century art. (In a self-serving statement, Lichacz writes unctuously 
that her paintings remind her "how fortunate I am to be able to say so much 
with so little.") 
</P>
<P>
Whether it is even possible to make evocative and convincing religious art 
within the deeply ironic context of serious contemporary art is an open 
question. It is likely that such art will have to incorporate qualities of 
struggle, dissent and doubt. It will certainly take a vision a good deal more 
searching and sophisticated than the one on view at the UCI gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sheila Lichacz: Paintings and Drawings 1980-1988" continues through Sunday at 
the UC Irvine Fine Arts Gallery (in Fine Arts Village, off Bridge Road).

France's environmentalist Greens Part made a surprise surge in municipal 
elections while the mainstream right-and left-wing alliances ran virtually neck 
and neck. Interior Minister Pierre Joxe estimated that only about 70% of the 
electorate of 38 million voted. Initial results showed President Francois 
Mitterand's Socialists and his Communist allies together gaining around 1% more 
of the vote than in the last municipal elections in 1983. Two conservative 
parties -- Rally for the Republic and Union for French Democracy -- lost about 
2% of the vote compared with four years ago, while the Greens captured as much 
as 4% compared to less than 1% in 1983.

JIMMY SANTIAGO BACA TO APPEAR TODAY ON LATC'S POETRY READING SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Poet Jimmy Santiago Baca, the mestizo (half Chicano/half "detribalized Apache") 
who taught himself to read and write while imprisoned and who recently won the 
American Book Award for poetry for his "Martin &amp; Meditations on the South 
Valley," will appear today at the Los Angeles Theatre Center. 
</P>
<P>
He replaces Russian poet Bella Akmadulina, who had to postpone her appearance 
because of visa problems, said Alan Mandell, poetry/literary series producer. 
</P>
<P>
Baca, whose other works include "Immigrants in Our Own Land" and the 
forthcoming "The Black Mesa Poems," was originally scheduled to read his poetry 
along with poet Victor Hernandez Cruz on April 17. He will not appear on that 
date but Cruz will appear as scheduled. Those holding tickets for Bella 
Akmadulina's appearance will be admitted to Jimmy Santiago Baca's reading 
today. The Los Angeles Theatre Center is currently negotiating to reschedule 
Akmadulina for a date next year.

MIDDLE EAST PAIR SOUGHT OUT CAPTAIN, OFFICIAL SAYS

A federal law enforcement official today said two Middle Eastern-looking men 
were in Will Rogers' neighborhood looking for the home of the Vincennes skipper 
in the weeks before a van driven by his wife was bombed. 
</P>
<P>
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was not clear if 
investigators had been able to piece together detailed descriptions of the two 
men. The information was based on interviews with neighbors, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers commanded the missile cruiser that mistakenly shot down an Iranian 
airliner in the Persian Gulf last July, killing all 290 people aboard. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers' wife, Sharon, was driving the van Friday when the bomb exploded, 
destroying the vehicle. Sharon Rogers was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators remained uncertain today whether the bomb was the work of 
terrorists retaliating for the jetliner's downing. 
</P>
<P>
The law enforcement official, who said the men were spotted asking where the 
Navy captain lived, spoke following a report in today's New York Times that a 
man of Middle Eastern appearance asked passers-by, "Where does the captain 
live?" 
</P>
<P>
Will Rogers had driven the van earlier Friday for a regular trip to a nearby 
doughnut shop, and he thought he may have been the intended target. The 
Rogerses have been under the protection of naval intelligence agents at an 
undisclosed location since shortly after the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials said they were awaiting FBI findings to determine when the 
couple can return to work.

Lame-duck Mayor Eugene Sawyer today refused to endorse a candidate in next 
month's mayoral election, despite pressure from black leaders to throw his 
support behind third-party hopeful Timothy Evans. 
</P>
<P>
"After careful consideration, I have decided not to endorse any candidate," 
Sawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Sawyer lost the Feb. 28 Democratic primary to Richard M. Daley, the son of 
Richard J. Daley, the legendary political boss who ran City Hall for 22 years. 
Evans, a black alderman, bypassed the primary to run as an independent in the 
April 4 general election and will face white candidates Daley and Edward 
Vrdolyak, 51, the Republican nominee.

PUTS $100-MILLION GLOBAL NETWORK SATELLITE IN ORBIT

Discovery's five astronauts thundered into a weather-delayed orbit today and 
successfully released the final $100-million satellite in a globe-spanning 
network that will let spacefarers call Mission Control at almost any time. 
</P>
<P>
In a spectacular start of NASA's ambitious plan to fly seven shuttle missions 
in 1989, Discovery made a fiery leap from its seaside launch pad and then raced 
out of view across a clear Florida sky. The craft slipped smoothly into orbit 
with five astronauts, the communications satellite and experiments that include 
four rats with broken legs and 32 chicken eggs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great start to a long launch season," launch director Bob Sieck told a 
news conference at the Kennedy Space Center. 
</P>
<P>
The 9:57 a.m. EST liftoff was an hour and 50 minutes later than planned. Early 
morning fog -- so dense it obscured the launch pad from just a short distance 
away -- caused some delay, but the major problem was winds five miles overhead. 
Officials feared powerful shear forces could tear the spacecraft apart as it 
raced upward faster than the speed of sound. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Computer Reprogrammed 
</P>
<P>
To compensate for the winds, a computer aboard Discovery was quickly 
reprogrammed to adjust the ship's flight angle, and the stalled countdown clock 
was restarted and then ticked without hesitation to liftoff. 
</P>
<P>
Michael L. Coats, a 43-year-old Navy captain, is Discovery's commander, and Air 
Force Col. John E. Blaha, 46, is the pilot. Others in the crew are Marine Cols. 
James F. Buchli, 43, and Robert C. Springer, 46, and Dr. James M. Bagian, 36, a 
physician. Coats and Buchli have flown on previous shuttle flights. 
</P>
<P>
Once in orbit, the astronauts prepared the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite 
for its release into an independent orbit. 
</P>
<P>
The 2 1/2-ton satellite was tested electronically while secured in Discovery's 
cargo bay. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked very good from up here," Bagian reported after he had thrown 
switches to send power to the satellite. "It looked very crisp." 
</P>
<P>
Televised views from space showed the huge satellite filling most of the cargo 
bay. 
</P>
<P>
The satellite was then tilted upright in the cargo bay and ejected into space 
on its own. 
</P>
<P>
After Coats moved Discovery a safe distance away, a first stage rocket on TDRS 
drilled the satellite into a higher orbit. A second rocket firing five hours 
later was to send it streaking to a permanent communications post 22,300 miles 
above the Atlantic Ocean.

The first woman to serve as NASA commentator for the liftoff of a spaceship 
carrying astronauts said today that she was pleased with her performance -- 
even though she jumped the gun in one of her reports. 
</P>
<P>
"I said the ice team had already made their report to management," Lisa Malone, 
27, said. "And I thought that they had. This was one of those times when there 
was a lot going on. It was just a few minutes later, then they came on and gave 
their report." 
</P>
<P>
Malone, who sat in the top row of the firing room a few seats down from the 
launch director for Discovery's liftoff, said "it was just a matter of time" 
before NASA used a woman as launch commentator. 
</P>
<P>
After the launch, she was back in her office at the Kennedy Space Center's 
press headquarters, where she works as space shuttle specialist. Instead of 
analyzing weather and engineering reports, however, she was kept busy by 
reporters asking her to analyze her performance. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I did all right," she said, adding that it went more smoothly than she 
expected "because the launch team did such a good job, they made my job 
easier."

Yuri Nagata of Gufuken, Japan, who would have turned 18 today, had moved past a

friend suggested taking a photograph of her, and as she was standing up to get 
the photograph taken, she lost her balance and fell," said Chuck Lundy of the 
National Park Service. She was a member of a youth group on a U.S. tour, Lundy 
said.

IRS AUDITS 23 TELEVISION MINISTRIES; 
</P>
<P>
COULD JEOPARDIZE TAX EXEMPTION OF SOME TELEVANGELISTS

<P>
The Internal Revenue Service is auditing the finances of 23 television 
ministries and expects the probe could jeopardize the federal tax exemption of 
some evangelists. 
</P>
<P>
"The service is continuing to devote significant examination resources to media 
evangelist cases," Robert I. Brauer, assistant IRS commissioner in charge of 
exempt organizations, said in a letter to Rep. J. J. Pickle (D-Tex.), chairman 
of the House Ways and Means oversight subcommittee. Pickle released the report 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Because of privacy laws, the report did not mention the ministries by name. 
Identifying them only by number, Brauer outlined key issues against the 23, 
most of which are suspected of not fully reporting their income, engaging in 
political activities, or allowing their earnings to benefit officials of the 
ministry. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS stepped up its examination of TV ministries after the well-publicized 
sex-and-bribery scandal at the PTL organization headed by Jim Bakker. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Move to Final Stages' 
</P>
<P>
PTL, which apparently is ministry No. 15 in the report, is in bankruptcy court, 
where the IRS is pressing claims that Bakker and his associates failed to pay 
tax on unrelated business income, such as from rental of PTL's satellite 
network; failed to report some income, and used PTL contributions for their own 
enrichment, including acceptance of salaries that the IRS contends were 
excessive. 
</P>
<P>
Brauer said he expects several of the TV ministry cases "will move to the final 
stages of the examination process this year." 
</P>
<P>
"We also anticipate that some of these cases will present serious issues 
relating to continued federal income tax exemption," Brauer said. 
</P>
<P>
Brauer's cover letter said two organizations connected with former Republican 
presidential candidate Pat Robertson have refused to provide records of the 
type that other TV ministries have provided voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Freedom Council and the National Freedom Institute would not 
cooperate, the letter stated, the IRS had to go to federal court in Norfolk, 
Va., to seek to enforce a summons for the records. 
</P>
<P>
"The degree of cooperation received by the service varies from case to case 
and, in one case involving a prominent evangelist, the service has reached 
agreement on federal tax issues for the years 1980 through 1983, including 
payment of substantial federal income tax, interest and penalties," Brauer 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some highlights of the report, which was current through Dec. 31: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ministry No. 1 was engaged in a life style that led the IRS to believe that 
some income was not reported. Acting on an informant's tip, the Criminal 
Investigation Division prepared a case that has been referred to a federal 
grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No. 4: IRS agents are reviewing content of TV broadcasts to determine 
whether they were primarily political. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No. 8: A team of auditors and a computer specialist are investigating 
allegations of political activities, lobbying and personal enrichment from 
ministry funds. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No. 16: The IRS has completed review of the books and records for this 
ministry for 1984 through 1986. The chief issue is whether tax-deductible 
contributions to the ministry flowed to the benefit of the founder and his 
family.

In other words, those who cannot prove they are fleeing political persecution

SOVIET CHUNKY BECOMES CHICHI FOR WATCH BUYERS

<P>
In an era of high-tech electronic gadgets, the Soviet Union's old-fashioned 
mechanical watches are conquering fashion-crazy Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Genuine Soviet-made watches are selling in classy Italian jewelry shops as fast 
as the Soviets can produce them, and the United States and the rest of Europe 
are the Soviets' next targets. 
</P>
<P>
Less than five months after the first Cyrillic-inscribed "Made in the USSR" 
timepieces crossed the border, the Soviet watch industry has received the 
highest of accolades -- thousands of fakes are appearing on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union has long been the world's third-largest producer of clocks and 
watches after Switzerland and the Far East, but until last fall exports were 
confined to selling parts and movements to Western makers. 
</P>
<P>
The chunky 1950s-style wrist-watches, including five models previously made 
exclusively for the Red Army, are the most successful Soviet consumer products 
to reach the West under Mikhail S. Gorbachev's new era of reform. 
</P>
<P>
Displayed in high-class Italian shops next to gold Rolexes and diamond-studded 
bracelets, the utilitarian Paketa and Red Army Boctok watches have become a 
sought-after status symbol. 
</P>
<P>
"We have convinced jewelers who sell watches worth (thousands of dollars) to 
display side by side these simple Soviet products which cost as little as 
($75)," said Orazio Occhipinti, who last fall clinched the European 
distribution contract for Paketa. 
</P>
<P>
Occhipinti said his entire stock of 40,000 Paketa watches was sold out in the 
two months before Christmas, and he has no doubt that the 150,000 more he plans 
to import to Italy in 1989 will get a similar reception. 
</P>
<P>
"They are an anti-status status symbol. . . . The Russians seem a bit 
astonished. They can't quite understand why they're in such demand," Occhipinti 
said.

RJR Nabisco Inc., the tobacco and food products giant that recently went 
private in a $24.7-billion buyout, said today that American Express Co. 
President Louis Gerstner Jr. will be its new chairman, president and chief 
executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
Gerstner, 47, heads up Amex's Travel Related Services Co. unit, which manages 
the company's lucrative charge card and travelers' check businesses. He will 
take office at RJR on April 3, replacing acting Chairman and Chief Executive J. 
Paul Sticht. 
</P>
<P>
RJR's top post became vacant when Chief Executive F. Ross Johnson resigned 
after failing to win a record bidding war for the Atlanta-based company, maker 
of Winston, Salem and Camel cigarettes, as well as Oreos, Shredded Wheat and 
Fig Newtons. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who made an initial bid for RJR last October, was ultimately defeated 
by New York leveraged buyout specialists Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., 
which conducted the search for his replacement. Gerstner's choice surprised 
some industry leaders -- the executive has never worked in the tobacco or food 
business. But the Harvard Business School graduate is well-known for his strong 
marketing and managing skills. Amex's travel unit, considered a blue-ribbon 
outfit in the financial services industry, had record profits of $183.5 million 
in the fourth quarter.

Hundreds of people who bought $12 tickets on Eastern Airline's Northeast 
shuttle headed home this morning, one day late, after getting stranded in three 
cities when there were no bargain-basement seats for them on planes. 
</P>
<P>
"Nightmare of nightmares," was how Catherine Holtz, 24, described her night 
sleeping on the carpet at New York's LaGuardia Airport before she returned home 
to Boston today. "I'm not so sure if it was worth it. It was a good idea in 
theory."

Eastern's three-day offer of rock-bottom fares on the Washington-New

12,500 Sunday, said John Siefert, vice president for the shuttle.

Although fares went up to $49 today, Eastern said it would honor through Friday 
the $12 tickets sold over the weekend. After Friday, prices will return to $69 
on weekends, $99 on weekdays and Sunday evening.

About 250 passengers were stuck at LaGuardia late Sunday, 200 failed to get on 
flights from Boston's Logan Airport and at least 100 were turned away at 
Washington's National Airport. Many spent the night at the airports and took 
the first shuttle flights out this morning. 
</P>
<P>
"The first two went out full, so I'm hoping we got most of them," said Rosa R. 
Williams, shuttle manager at National Airport. On Sunday night, Eastern 
employees had given stranded shuttle passengers peanuts and decks of cards. 
</P>
<P>
Pickets outside the Eastern terminal in Boston today took note of stranded 
passengers with a sign that read: "Pay $12 and sleep at the terminal." 
</P>
<P>
Debbie McLoughlin of New York, who spent the night at Eastern's terminal in 
Boston, called it "an adventure. I'm a scab, though, with the $12 flight. I 
took advantage of a good thing." 
</P>
<P>
Most of those left at LaGuardia were promised a seat on an Eastern flight this 
morning or flew on Pan Am's rival shuttle, said Port Authority Police Lt. 
Alexander Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
"When Eastern said 'That's it,' these people went over to Pan Am," said Harvey, 
whose agency runs the airport. Pan Am added a flight to Washington and 
chartered two buses to Boston, he said. 
</P>
<P>
David Hess, a spokesman at Washington's National Airport, said some passengers 
waited five hours for seats. About 40 were spending the night at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern maintained that passengers knew what they were getting into when they 
bought the cheap tickets. 
</P>
<P>
"Those people were not stranded. We advertised the flights were on a 
first-come, first-served basis," Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said. "I'm 
sorry they have to wait for the next flight, but they should have gotten there 
earlier."

The NCAA has notified Western Kentucky University that it will not investigate 
allegations against its basketball program that surfaced in a newspaper 
article. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter dated last Wednesday and released by the university today, David 
Berst, assistant executive director for enforcement, said the NCAA enforcement 
staff concluded that insufficient reliable information was available. 
</P>
<P>
The Courier-Journal in Louisville reported last August that eight former 
Western basketball players said they received cash, clothes or other improper 
benefits through boosters and coaches while they were on the team.

Joe Runyan overtook Susan Butcher and Martin Buser early today as the 
half-dozen leaders in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race moved from the Yukon 
River to the Bering Sea Coast, setting up the final sprint to Nome. 
</P>
<P>
Runyan, a musher from Nenana, checked into this Norton Sound community just a 
minute ahead of Butcher. He logged in at 6:45 a.m. local time Monday, with the 
three-time champion in at 6:46 a.m., and Buser, from Big Lake, reporting in at 
7:14 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
9-Minute Stay 
</P>
<P>
Butcher of Manley had left the Yukon River village of Kaltag at 6:55 p.m. 
Sunday, with Buser a minute behind her. Runyan, running 16 dogs to Butcher's 12 
and Buser's 11, pulled out at 7:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Then came Dee Dee Jonrowe of Willow, logging out at 9:13 p.m., four-time 
champion Rick Swenson of Manley, 9:14 p.m., and Lavon Barve of Wasilla leaving 
at 10:19 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
From Unalakleet, the mushers race 38 miles up one of the windiest stretches of 
the trail to Shaktoolik. 
</P>
<P>
Waiting for the first musher into Nome is $50,000 of a $250,000 jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
The leaders -- Butcher, Buser, Runyan, Swenson, Barve and Jonrowe -- have been 
out front of the pack since they left the gold mining ghost town of Iditarod, 
558 miles into the race and its half-way point.
