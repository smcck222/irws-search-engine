<TEXT>
<P>
Polite but slight applause greeted Ramesh Krishnan of India as he walked onto 
the court Monday morning to play Andrei Chesnokov of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Counting the linespeople and ball retrievers, there might have been 200 people 
in the stands or sitting on the grassy embankment on one side of the Grandstand 
Court at Hyatt Grand Champions. 
</P>
<P>
There were distinct aromas of sun-tan lotion and grilled hamburgers while 
Krishnan warmed up. 
</P>
<P>
Several times during his first-round match in the Newsweek Champions Cup, 
Krishnan had to stop what he was doing because of distractions. 
</P>
<P>
Once, when Krishnan was trying to serve, two young boys not more than 10 feet 
away were laughing as they put grass down the backs of one another's shirts. 
</P>
<P>
Another time, a ballgirl fainted and had to be helped to a chair in the shade. 
People tried to find seats between points instead of waiting for changeovers. 
</P>
<P>
"That's part of the game," Krishnan said. "You try not to let that bother you." 
</P>
<P>
Bother? What bother? It is usually a mark of Krishnan's stoicism not to react 
to such intrusions. But he actually kicked a ball after playing a bad shot and 
later, for a change, dropped his racket and booted it across the court. 
</P>
<P>
Things were not going well for Krishnan and they quickly got worse. 
</P>
<P>
He got a swift kick from Chesnokov, 3-6, 6-4, 6-1, in a match that was 
separated by more than miles from the greatest victory of his career, which 
occurred only seven weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
It was different the day Krishnan beat Sweden's Mats Wilander, the No. 1 player 
in the world, on a gray Thursday at Melbourne. 
</P>
<P>
How long ago was it? Apparently very long ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even remember it," Krishnan said. "One match doesn't make a 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
But it did once. 
</P>
<P>
The stadium court was nearly full for Wilander's match during the first week of 
the Australian Open. He would be playing the Krishnan, 27, the best player to 
come out of Madras, India, since his father, Ramanathan. 
</P>
<P>
Krishnan scored a shocking straight-set victory over Wilander. After punching a 
backhand volley past Wilander on match point, Krishnan raised both arms in 
triumph and looked where wife Priya was sitting. 
</P>
<P>
Krishnan said it was the biggest victory of his career. That was Jan. 19. He 
has won once since. 
</P>
<P>
He lost in the first round at the Volvo/U.S. Indoor to Glenn Michibata. 
Krishnan beat Marty Davis in the first round at the U.S. Pro Indoor, but 
defaulted to Jim Courier when he injured his back. 
</P>
<P>
And last week at Scottsdale, Ariz., Krishnan lost in the first round to Emilio 
Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
The defeats have begun to run together for Krishnan, and they have come too 
soon for him to be able to enjoy what he accomplished against Wilander. 
</P>
<P>
"I've not been playing enough matches," he said. "I've been struggling to get 
into form. If I can only struggle and win a few matches, then my form will pick 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Krishnan's life has not really changed since his great upset victory. He should 
have been recognized anywhere he went, at least for a week. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Gunnarsson of Sweden said this may be one of the funny little tricks tennis 
plays on people. 
</P>
<P>
Gunnarsson is another player who made an impact at Melbourne. He was a surprise 
semifinalist and returned home to Monte Carlo in a wonderful mood that has 
lasted longer than Krishnan's. 
</P>
<P>
The Swede lost to Brad Gilbert in the first round here, saying it was because 
he had slept funny the night before and woke up with a sore neck. He smiled 
anyway and kissed his daughter, Anna. 
</P>
<P>
"Ramesh, maybe there is a lot of pressure on him now," Gunnarsson said. "Maybe 
he is not happy enough. I don't know. 
</P>
<P>
"He is trying to play the same way he did then, but it is difficult to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Krishnan said he has never been interested in a high-profile life. So, the lack 
of attention since the Wilander match has not bothered him. 
</P>
<P>
As he said: "I am not a movie star. The question is, can I win matches?" 
</P>
<P>
The answer is, not lately. 
</P>
<P>
After suffering another first-round loss, Krishnan and Priya began to walk to 
their hotel. 
</P>
<P>
They would pack their luggage for the next tournament at Key Biscayne, Fla. 
There, things may be better. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the highest seeded players who played their first-round matches all 
won. Besides the victory of 10th-seeded Gilbert, 11th-seeded Sanchez defeated 
Dan Goldie, and Yannick Noah, seeded 12th, defeated Nicolas Pereira, 7-6, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Noah fought off four set points in the first, battling both the 18-year-old 
Uruguayan and tendinitis in his left knee. Noah won the first-set tiebreaker, 
10-8. 
</P>
<P>
Noah almost didn't play here. He waited until last Wednesday to decide that his 
knee felt good enough to try. Though he played tentatively because of his knee, 
Noah said it never really bothered him. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I was a little bit slow," he said. "I felt like the net was so far away 
when I was coming in. That's a bad sign." 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
Michael Chang, 17, defeated Alexander Volkov, 6-4, 7-5, and will play Steve 
Bryan, 18, a wild-card entry from the University of Texas, in the second round. 
Chang rallied from 1-4 in the second set against Volkov. "I just wanted to stay 
with him," Chang said. "It was 4-1, but that's only one break. He's the type of 
player that will make one great shot and then miss one."

THE PREPS / LONNIE WHITE: MORNINGSIDE'S GIRLS HAVE SCORE TO SETTLE 
</P>

<P>
For the second consecutive year, the Inglewood Morningside High School girls' 
basketball team will play Oakland Fremont for the state Division I championship 
at the Oakland Coliseum Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Morningside held a 52-44 lead with four minutes remaining in the 
game, then went cold and lost, 53-52. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Monarchs (31-1) will get a chance for redemption Saturday night, but 
only after receiving a scare last Saturday in their Southern Regional 
championship game against San Diego Point Loma. 
</P>
<P>
That game was the most bizarre of the six championship games at the Sports 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Monarchs completely dominated the first five minutes, running off to a 
17-0 lead. Then they were outscored in the next 11 minutes, 27-13, and led at 
halftime, 30-27. 
</P>
<P>
Their problems started when junior center Lisa Leslie picked up her third foul 
early in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured that (Point Loma) would come back," Morningside Coach Frank Scott 
said. "I just did not see them coming back so far and so fast. 
</P>
<P>
"Having Leslie in foul trouble definitely played a major part in their 
comeback." 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma continued its rally in the second half when Leslie picked up her 
fourth foul with almost six minutes left in the third quarter. The Pointers 
even took a 36-30 lead with 2:24 left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"Our intensity level just fell off at that point," Scott said. "We did not have 
the same aggressiveness and just did not keep them down." 
</P>
<P>
Scott took a gamble with 5:59 remaining in the game when he sent Leslie back 
in. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept her out as long as I could," said Scott. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-5 Leslie made her presence felt immediately and the Lady Monarchs 
made their move. After several lead changes, she made a turnaround eight-foot 
jump shot to put Morningside ahead to stay with 55 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"She is probably the best offensive player, outside of Cheryl Miller, that I 
have seen," Scott said of Leslie, who finished with 22 points and 11 rebounds 
in her 21 minutes on the court. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie's last basket did not seal victory for Morningside, as Point Loma guard 
Monica Filer had a chance to win the game with seven seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
But Filer, who finished with 20 points, missed a 28-foot shot, thinking that 
that there were only three seconds remaining, giving the Lady Monarchs the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Point Loma gave us problems with their man-to-man defense," Scott said. "Most 
teams play us in a zone because of our quickness and size. Their defense was 
tough like Kentucky Southern (the only school Morningside has lost to this 
season)." 
</P>
<P>
Jo Jo Witherspoon, the Lady Monarchs' point guard and only senior, had a 
difficult time with the Pointers' defense. 
</P>
<P>
Witherspoon, who averaged nearly 18 points a game during the season, had only 
nine points and two assists. 
</P>
<P>
"She is the only player who handles the ball for us," Scott said of 
Witherspoon. "Point Loma did a great job in denying her the ball, which made it 
tough on her." 
</P>
<P>
Morningside has four other underclassmen playing major roles. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Janet Davis, is a 6-3 freshman who averages 11 points, 10 rebounds and 
four blocked shots per game. Scott refers to her as his star of the future. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Monarchs also have sophomores Akiba Flanigan, a 5-9 forward who 
averages seven points a game; 5-8 guard Tyesha Whiting and 5-7 guard Bridget 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
This will be the second meeting of the season between Morningside and Fremont. 
The Lady Monarchs defeated Fremont in December, 50-42. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside's boys almost joined the girls in Oakland but lost their Division 
III game against Mission Viejo Trabuco Hills, the Southern Section 3-A 
champion, 60-57. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs, who lost in the Southern Section 3-A semifinals, played the 
opposite of the Lady Monarchs in the first half, falling behind, 22-8. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside co-Coach Carl Franklin said the Monarchs' intense desire to win 
cost them in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to win so badly at first," Franklin said. "Once things started going 
wrong, we got frustrated and were complaining on every play." 
</P>
<P>
Morningside's bench was called for a technical foul early in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
After that, the Monarchs outscored the Mustangs in the last four minutes of the 
first half, 21-6. 
</P>
<P>
"We settled down after that technical," Franklin said. "The momentum seemed to 
move to us when we started to play a different type of . . . pressure defense." 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Morningside fell victim to what has at times plagued its 
girls' team, inability to maintain a lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs led with 5:40 left in the fourth quarter, 51-41, before Trabuco 
Hills rallied. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew that we are not any good at stalling," said Morningside's other coach, 
Ron Randle. "It is just a situation where we were able to get the lead by 
forcing the play but then had to make the decision to either stay with it or 
pull out." 
</P>
<P>
Morningside tried both, lost its momentum and was outscored the rest of the 
way, 19-6. 
</P>
<P>
"We were fortunate to have been invited into the state playoffs after losing in 
the (sectional) semifinals," Franklin said. "I am glad that we made a good 
showing."

ENGINE HEAT MAY HAVE SET OFF VAN BOMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Agents investigating the method used in last week's bombing of a van driven by 
the wife of Vincennes Capt. Will Rogers III have narrowed their suspicions to a 
crude device that could have detonated the bomb with the van's own engine heat, 
federal sources said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities were still reluctant to link the bombing attack to terrorists, but 
they confirmed Monday that they were checking reports from witnesses that men 
acting suspiciously, who appeared to be Middle Eastern, were spotted near the 
Rogerses' La Jolla home in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Retaliation Theory 
</P>
<P>
Terrorism is considered a possibility because Iran pledged retaliation after 
last summer's downing of a civilian Iranian airliner over the Persian Gulf by 
the missile cruiser Vincennes, which Rogers commands. Rogers gave the order to 
shoot the plane down after mistaking it for an attacking Iranian fighter. The 
downed plane carried 290 people to their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday's bombing is still being treated as "suspected or possible 
terrorism," an FBI official said, but other theories range all the way from one 
or two Iranians acting on their own to disgruntled sailors from Rogers' ship. 
</P>
<P>
"What if you have one or two Iranians or other followers of the Ayatollah who 
mount something on their own in response to the Ayatollah?" said one source 
close to the case in Washington. "Or, what if you have disgruntled sailors on 
the ship? Not any of this is being ruled out." 
</P>
<P>
It appears that no breakthrough is imminent, another source familiar with the 
investigation said. 
</P>
<P>
However, sources said investigators have come to suspect a heat-triggered 
device after finding no obvious signs of a timer or other form of detonating 
device. They said the explosion now appears to have been caused by one or two 
pipe bombs placed under the van, directly below the driver's seat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Possibility Wood Was Used 
</P>
<P>
One source close to the investigation in San Diego said theories are centering 
on the possibility that some type of light wood -- possibly balsa -- was 
attached to the bomb and the van's undercarriage. When the motor heated, the 
wood could have ignited and detonated the bomb. 
</P>
<P>
He said the wood can be filed down to the size of a match stick or fuse, and 
that it can be "just taped" to the explosive or engine. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been done in the past," he said. "Apparently the CIA and terrorist groups 
have used it in the past. The wood would get hot enough and burn and this would 
be the ignitor." 
</P>
<P>
He also noted that no traces of the lightweight wood would be left after the 
resulting explosion. Officials at the scene have found small fragments of a 
plumber's pipe and end caps, but no clues as to the type of detonating device. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line on that is that the leads are zip," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Rogerses' van had been parked overnight in the front driveway. Rogers first 
drove the van Friday morning to a doughnut shop about three-fourths of a mile 
from the home. They said he parked the vehicle in front of the shop's door and 
turned off the motor. Moments later, he returned home. 
</P>
<P>
About a hour later, Sharon Rogers drove the van about 3 miles before the 
explosion occurred as she was stopped at a traffic light in La Jolla. She 
escaped unhurt after leaving the van to investigate what she thought was a bump 
from behind. Moments after she got out, the van exploded in a fireball and 
metal fragments tore through the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
The sources pointed out that the device detonated when she slowed to a stop and 
the motor began to idle. Normally, an air-cooled engine would be cool as it was 
being driven, then would heat up as it idled. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators also were checking Monday on reports that as many as three Middle 
Eastern-looking men were seen in the neighborhood asking for the location of 
the Rogers home. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a couple of guys who asked a paper boy if there was a captain who 
lived on the street," said one law enforcement official. "But the kid had just 
moved in there and didn't get much of a description of the men. It happened 
about a week or two before" Friday's bombing. 
</P>
<P>
John Petrou, a 22-year-old neighbor who also spoke to the FBI, told The Times 
that he saw two men he described as Middle Eastern-looking drive into the 
Rogerses' cul-de-sac about two weeks before the bombing. Both acted suspicious, 
Petrou said. 
</P>
<P>
The first man reportedly was driving a gray BMW and drove by on a weekday 
afternoon when Petrou was outside washing his car, and the second went by a few 
days later in a Toyota. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, people that drive through the neighborhood we all know," Petrou said. 
"But these were two guys in separate cars, of Arabic descent. . . . I was 
watching them, but they didn't look at me. They didn't look in my face." 
</P>
<P>
But some officials downplayed the likelihood of the bombers surveying the 
neighborhood looking for the home. They noted that Rogerses are listed in the 
phone directory and that the home would be easy to find. 
</P>
<P>
"And nobody's told us for sure yet that this was an act of terrorism," one 
source said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Identity of Red Car 
</P>
<P>
Officials also on Monday identified the make of the red car seen making a 
U-turn and speeding from the bombing scene as a Dodge Omni and said that it had 
been driving behind Sharon Rogers when the van exploded. They also said that as 
many as four people were reported inside the red car. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody got a license plate or anything like that," said one investigator. "And 
we don't know that that's a real connection. It could be somebody panicked when 
this thing went off." 
</P>
<P>
Officials also elaborated on a telephone call taken by Sharon Rogers at home 
shortly after the July incident in which her husband ordered the Iranian 
jetliner shot down. The caller at that time asked if she was the "murderer's 
wife," then Sharon Rogers hung up. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, the Naval Intelligence Service placed a tap on her phone, but no 
other frightening or threatening calls were received. 
</P>
<P>
However, Sharon Rogers did receive a letter, officials said, which, while not 
personally threatening, did discuss the Persian Gulf incident. 
</P>
<P>
"It was more of a 'How come these people had to die? Why did this happen?' but 
it wasn't really threatening," said one source. "And she turned it over to the 
NIS, too." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Navy Security Tight 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, security remained tight at all San Diego area naval bases. At the 
32nd Street Naval Station, where the Vincennes is docked, security personnel 
checked identification of everyone entering. Sailors leaving the base said they 
were told to be alert and report all suspicious occurrences or persons. 
</P>
<P>
Two Vincennes crew members leaving the Navy exchange declined to discuss the 
bombing. The two men said they had been advised that reporters might seek them 
out. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be careful what we say, since the FBI still doesn't know who did 
this," said one young sailor. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Colgate University in upstate New York, where the Rogerses' son is 
a student, said Monday they increased campus security after consulting over the 
weekend with the FBI and naval intelligence. There have been no threats against 
Will Rogers IV or any other students, according to Lee Pelton, dean of the 
college. 
</P>
<P>
Access to his residence hall has been limited and security at the campus main 
gate has been tightened, he said. The school has 2,600 students, and "is small 
enough that visitors are noticed," Pelton said. 
</P>

Leftist rebels in El Salvador dynamited an election center near San Salvador, 
the capital, and threatened to target election workers unless they resign. The 
rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, which has called for a boycott 
of the March 19 presidential election, also repeated its warning for vehicles 
to stay off roads. In a broadcast on the clandestine Radio Venceremos, the 
rebels said election workers who do not resign will be "considered by our 
people as part of the counterinsurgency," which would make them targets of the 
guerrillas. The rebels have boycotted all five elections this decade, but their 
threats against election workers and the attack on the election center were 
unprecedented.

Muslim-led troops bombarded Beirut's Christian-held port in a new round of 
sectarian moves against air and sea traffic, security sources said. The port 
came under Muslim fire despite a conciliatory move by the Christian premier and 
army commander, Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, who lifted a two-day shutdown of 
Beirut's international airport. The rival Muslim Cabinet of acting Premier 
Salim Hoss ordered the closing of Beirut's main port and Juniyah harbor, 
controlled by a hard-line Christian militia, in retaliation for Aoun's ban on 
flights. The Christian crackdown on the airport came in retaliation for weekend 
battles with Druze militiamen, sparked in turn by Aoun's blockade of smaller, 
militia-controlled ports used for bringing in weapons.

PAPANDREOU SURVIVES NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Greek Socialist government of Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou survived a 
no-confidence motion by the opposition New Democracy party aimed at toppling 
the Socialists because of a series of scandals. The Socialists secured an 
absolute majority of 155 votes in the 300-seat Parliament. Three prominent 
Socialist members, including former Justice Minister George Manghakis and 
former Education Minister Antonis Tritsis, abstained. They were the latest 
Socialists to break ranks with the government over a series of financial and 
personal scandals involving alleged embezzlement and payoffs that has embroiled 
Papandreou, 70.

China made a conciliatory offer to Tibet, saying it would welcome talks with 
that region's exiled Buddhist spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama. However, a 
report in the official Beijing Review said the government stands by its 
position that independence for Tibet cannot be discussed. The Dalai Lama, 53, 
who fled to India in 1959 after an abortive uprising against Chinese rule, is 
regarded by many as a key to peace in Tibet. China's conciliatory gesture came 
a week after authorities crushed anti-Chinese protests in the troubled 
Himalayan territory. Chinese troops are still patrolling the streets of Lhasa, 
the Tibetan capital, residents reported.

A Liberian-registered chemical tanker exploded and burst into flames off Japan, 
and 23 crew members were reported missing, the Maritime Safety Agency said. The 
Maasgusar, carrying 25,700 tons of methanol and other flammable liquids, "is 
still burning and explosions are ripping through its body," according to an 
agency spokesman. The cause of the explosions was undetermined. The ship, with 
a crew of 19 Filipinos and four Britons, was bound for Yokohama, Japan, from 
Texas when it caught fire more than 60 miles south of Tokyo Bay, the spokesman 
said.

Chicago Acting Mayor Eugene Sawyer declared that he would not endorse a 
candidate in next month's mayoral election, despite pleas from the Rev. Jesse 
Jackson and others to support the only black candidate in the race. Sawyer, the 
city's second black mayor, spurned calls from Jackson and several local 
committeemen to help community by backing Alderman Timothy Evans. Evans, who 
did not support Sawyer in last month's Democratic primary, is running as a 
third party candidate in the April 4 election against Democrat Richard M. Daley 
and Republican Edward R. Vrdolyak.

Three Salvadoran refugees in San Francisco went 24 days without food in a fast 
designed to protest U.S. policies toward Salvadorans seeking political asylum. 
Gilma Cruz, 22; Jose Cartagena, 26, and Jeremias Ruiz ended the fast Sunday at 
St. John's Lutheran Church. "We are ending the fast with a strong call to the 
North American people to go (into) the streets and demonstrate against the war 
in El Salvador," said Cartegena. The United States maintains that refugees from 
El Salvador are seeking economic opportunities, not fleeing political 
persecution. Only 3% of Salvadoran applicants are granted political asylum, 
compared with 54% of all other nationalities, said Carolina Castaneda, director 
of the Central American Refugee Center.

A Goleta beach bluff cave collapsed in an avalanche of sand, killing a 
17-year-old youth and injuring a 14-year-old friend who jumped into the clear, 
authorities said. Hugo Cruz of Goleta was pronounced dead on More Mesa Beach 
after paramedics and a search team dug his body out of the sand, Santa Barbara 
County sheriff's deputies said. His friend, Frank Ramirez, also of Goleta, told 
deputies that the two were sitting at the mouth of a shallow cave, waiting for 
other youths to bring them lunch, when the earth suddenly caved in around them. 
Ramirez was able to jump away, barely escaping being buried, but his friend was 
asleep and did not have a chance to get away, deputies said.

The jury in the Fawaz Younis sky piracy trial in Washington interrupted its 
deliberations to ask the judge to clarify his instructions on whether a "person 
of ordinary common sense" would have known that hijacking a plane was illegal. 
U.S. District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. repeated for the jury the 
instructions he gave it last Friday. But in what Younis' court-appointed 
attorney Francis D. Carter interpreted as a victory, the judge inserted a 
phrase stipulating that the jury may consider whether an ordinary person in 
Beirut, Lebanon, ought to have understood that sky piracy was against the law. 
During two days on the witness stand last week, Younis acknowledged that he led 
a band of five armed men aboard Royal Jordanian Airlines Flight 402 in Beirut 
on June 11, 1985, in Beirut and held its 70 passengers and crew members hostage 
for 30 hours. Younis said that he was acting under orders from the Amal 
militia, a Lebanese Shiite Muslim group. The jury later recessed without 
reaching a verdict.

JAKOB GIMPEL, RENOWNED L.A. PIANIST, DIES AT 82 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jakob Gimpel, an aristocratic pianist long considered one of Los Angeles' most 
cherished cultural assets, died Sunday at his home in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran of hundreds of recitals around the world and a venerated 
academician who had retired a few years ago as Distinguished Professor in 
Residence at Cal State Northridge was 82. 
</P>
<P>
His son, Peter, said he had suffered from arthritis and circulatory problems. 
His last recital was in 1987 at UCLA's Royce Hall when he managed to complete a 
performance despite great shoulder pain. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Gimpel said his father had suffered for years from arthritis "and 
continued to play very bravely." He also had lost the sight in his right eye. 
</P>
<P>
Gimpel was equally at home on the concert stage and in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
"Performing artists must have tenacity, endurance and courage," he would tell 
his students. Often he would make that statement only hours after demonstrating 
those three qualities himself while seated at the piano in one of the many 
concert halls he had graced in a career that began in Vienna in 1923. 
</P>
<P>
Born to musical parents and brother of the late violinist Bronislaw Gimpel, who 
in time was to become concertmaster of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Jakob 
Gimpel began his piano studies at home. 
</P>
<P>
He became proficient at an early age and by the time he was 8 "I was already 
playing in the pit of my grandfather's theater," he told The Times in a 1978 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
"I had my union card," he said. "I played in a cabaret. Of a childhood, I had 
absolutely none. But all these experiences made me a better musician." 
</P>
<P>
He made his concert debut in 1923 and went on a highly successful tour 
performing as many as 80 concerts in a single country. Nearly all featured his 
Romantic specialties -- Brahms, Beethoven and Chopin. 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife, Mimi, came to the United States in 1938, and after recitals in 
New York, which he staged without help from major management, moved to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
He blamed the lack of that management for being typecast by the media as a 
"minor artist." 
</P>
<P>
"For years they sent only their second-string critics to review me. . . ," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Gimpel turned to film work to earn a living. He played with the 
MGM orchestra and with the exception of an occasional solo (Liszt's E-Flat 
Concerto in the 1943 thriller "Above Suspicion") labored in obscurity. 
</P>
<P>
In 1949, he finally gained the recognition that had escaped him and was invited 
to participate in the New York segment of the Chopin centennial. After 11 years 
in this country he had attracted first-string reviewers. And they were 
favorable. 
</P>
<P>
In 1954, he returned to concertize in Europe, particularly Germany. From then 
until his health began to fail, he was a regular in European concert halls. 
</P>
<P>
Among his many honors was the Order of Merit, First Class, of the Federal 
Republic of Germany for his "great service as an interpreter of German Music" 
and "in recognition of his role in the resumption of German-American cultural 
relations after the war." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the piece he was performing, Gimpel came to be known for seeking 
out the individual characteristics of the composer, delineating each phrase as 
he imagined the composer would have wished, thus minimizing his own 
interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
Through the 1960s and '70s he was heard more often in Europe than in his 
adopted city although his performances here, many of them at Ambassador 
Auditorium, were generally sold out. 
</P>
<P>
He performed in the early 1940s at the Hollywood Bowl and in the late 1960s at 
the Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
Gimpel's career coincided with the end of the careers of several great pianists 
and he discharged his debt to them by mentioning them often in interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Artur Schnabel was "the first pianist of substance to have a big career," 
Gimpel said. Josef Hofmann "was a phenomenal technician but musically he had 
little to say." Sergei Rachmaninoff was "dazzling. But he couldn't play 
Beethoven." 
</P>
<P>
As recently as 1984, Gimpel was continuing to perform at the Ambassador, where 
a Times critic said his Brahms, Beethoven and Chopin recital "wrote whole 
chapters of human experience from mere notes." 
</P>
<P>
He also performed at Cal State Northridge, where his teachings drew from his 
own first trying days when he was without money and professional advice. 
</P>
<P>
"Performing artists must have tenacity, endurance and courage. Theirs is the 
only career where you need publicity," he would say. 
</P>
<P>
"Huberman (Bronislaw Huberman, the violinist who was Gimpel's mentor in the 
1930s), used to say 'We always compete with General Motors.' " 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife and son.

AL MARTINEZ: DYING IS A SCARY THING TO DO 
</P>

<TEXT>

From where he sits, the young man can see the buck-brush ceanothus blooming on 
the slopes of the Santa Monica Mountains, brushing tones of smoky white into 
the deep green. Signs of spring are everywhere in the canyon that encloses him. 
Feathery yellow acacias glow in the sunlight, and blossoming fruit trees sing 
renewal to the sweet-scented breezes that blow across an open courtyard. The 
young man sits amid the bursts of life on a day laced with gold. And he talks 
about death. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I dream I'm dying," he says, pulling a heavy jacket around him, more 
protection from the dream than the day. "I see myself being shot and then I 
feel myself, you know, fading away, and I wake up sweating, man, really 
shaking. I can't tell you the feeling." He thinks about it for a moment and 
then says, "You hear guys say they'd die for their neighborhoods, but you know, 
man, when you think about it, dying is a scary thing. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
His name is Richard and he is sitting slightly hunched forward on a bench at 
the edge of a central courtyard in a Los Angeles County juvenile probation camp 
tucked into Las Virgenes Canyon. Walls 14 feet high surround the camp, and the 
rules of incarceration are severe and unbending, belying the peaceful tone of 
its surroundings. This is prison. The young man knows it. 
</P>
<P>
Richard is a member of the Westside Raymond Crips and is doing time for armed 
robbery and possession of narcotics. "Sometimes," he says on the day I visit 
him, "I think I'm going to get out of the gangs, you know, leave the city. But 
you've got to go far away, man, or they'll find you. A friend will find you, or 
an enemy. You don't just step in and step out of a gang, man. You step in and 
they lock the door behind you." 
</P>
<P>
"This is like R&amp;R for those guys," camp director Robert Stanley says as he 
leads the way through the bleak dormitory that is home to the camp's 125 
inmates. "They come out of a war zone to 'rest.' It's safe here. A lot of them 
get nervous when it comes time to leave and sabotage themselves to do more 
time." 
</P>
<P>
He stops and turns to face me. "They're only kids. Sure they can be deadly, but 
they're still kids and they have no options. We try to develop their 
self-esteem, but you put them back in the same neighborhood and it's a lost 
cause. Eventually they bend to the pressures and the temptations. A guy running 
dope makes $600 a week. How can $5 an hour compete with that?" 
</P>
<P>
What strikes me are the contrasts. The youth of the boys and the enormity of 
their crimes. The vast efforts and the deep frustrations. Spring coming and 
lives unraveling. "I'll never make it," a young man says to me on a day that 
glows with birth. "I'll be dead by the time I'm 20." 
</P>
<P>
Who's to blame? I read the numbers. Sixty-nine gang killings in the county in 
the first two months of the year. Maybe more than 400 by the time December 
fades. Babies die. Pregnant women die. Old men die. The sidewalks of L.A. are 
stained with the blood of the innocents. Who's to blame? You? Me? The cops? The 
kids? Curiosity brings me to the camp. 
</P>
<P>
"How did it happen?" I ask Richard. 
</P>
<P>
The ambiguity of the question doesn't faze him. He's a bright kid, but at 18 
Richard has lived a lifetime of violent, antisocial behavior, shooting, 
robbing, beating and using a range of narcotics that staggers the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know, man," he says. "You kind of ease into a gang, you know? My 
brother was a gang-banger, in and out of jail. I began kicking with these guys 
when I was 12 and pretty soon I'm in. My mother would say, 'No, get out,' but 
it didn't do no good, man. I wouldn't come home or I'd come home stoned. You 
don't think about nothing. You get high and whatever comes up, man, you just do 
it. Who cares, you know?" 
</P>
<P>
"We were like a club at first," another kid says. His name is Perez and he's a 
member of the Lynwood Mob. "We only met to party, but then the Compton people 
brought in guns and people got shot. They shot one of our home boys and we shot 
them. It made no sense, you know? What were we doing? The scariest place is our 
own neighborhood. All I ever thought about was being killed." 
</P>
<P>
The time for talking is over. "I can make it, man," Richard says. "I dream of 
dying and I know now that dream can come true." 
</P>
<P>
As I drive out of Las Virgenes Canyon, I wonder if tonight he'll dream of 
death. And I wonder, as evidence of renewal brightens the mountainsides, if 
spring will ever truly come for him again.

CRASH OF TRUCK TRIGGERS FREEWAY TIE-UP

A speeding concrete pumping truck apparently blew a tire, veered sharply out of 
control and smashed into a pillar on the San Diego Freeway in Inglewood early 
Monday, killing the driver, injuring a motorist and jamming commuter traffic 
for hours, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the busy freeway was closed until the truck's wreckage could be cleared 
away. Traffic was backed up about two miles in both directions from the 
accident scene at the La Cienega Boulevard overpass. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nearby Streets Jammed 
</P>
<P>
The southbound lanes of the freeway were closed for about eight hours after the 
accident, reopening at 12:20 p.m. The northbound side was closed for about two 
hours, after which two lanes reopened. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of northbound motorists slowly edged past the wreckage until 9:30 
a.m., when all northbound lanes reopened, Caltrans reported. Nearby streets, 
such as Sepulveda Boulevard, were jammed. 
</P>
<P>
The truck driver was identified as Norton Roosevelt, 54, of Compton. 
</P>
<P>
CHP spokeswoman Diana Vickers blamed "excessive speed" for the shattering 
impact, which tore chunks off of a center divider and cracked a 
steel-reinforced pillar, but she declined to estimate the speed of the truck. 
"He was going faster than 55," she said. "We got that by the way the truck was 
damaged." 
</P>
<P>
The big three-axle vehicle, owned by American Standard Concrete Pumping Inc. of 
Gardena, was northbound at 4:50 a.m. when it suddenly veered across two lanes 
of traffic, topped the center divider and struck a support pillar on the 
southbound side of the freeway, CHP Officer Vicki Ogden said. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like the truck exploded on impact," Ogden said. 
</P>
<P>
"All the axles had been ripped from the carriage. The engine was out. It was 
just everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
CHP Officer Mark Howard said marks on the freeway indicate that the truck may 
have blown a left front tire. 
</P>
<P>
A flying four-pound chunk of metal from the wreck shattered the windshield of a 
southbound car driven by Efrain Orozco, 31, of Northridge, causing what the CHP 
described as major facial injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Orozco was taken to Centinela Hospital, where he underwent surgery and was 
later reported in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
Debris also struck cars driven by Bernal Bowen, 72, of Bakersfield, and Eva M. 
Alexander, 64, of Sylmar. The CHP said neither woman was injured, but their 
cars had to be towed away.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The death-penalty murder trial of Carlos Villa Fonseca began Monday with 
opening statements by attorneys on both sides who said the accused slayer of 
four was involved in a drug business operated out of a College Grove house 
where the victims were shot in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Fonseca, 24, a former Reno construction worker, is accused of murdering four 
people and critically wounding a fifth on Dec. 28 of that year after a robbery 
attempt at 3428 Hasty St. failed to yield any money derived from the sale of 
illicit drugs. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Fonseca could be sentenced to death because of the multiple 
murders and because they were committed during a robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Killed were Rosa Partida Medina, 25, the alleged leader of the cocaine and 
heroin drug ring; Enrique Mejia Beltran, 25; Migule Martinez Vasquez, 20, and 
Augustine Farfan, who investigators say was about 21. All were Mexican 
nationals. 
</P>
<P>
Armando Garcia Rubio, who was shot twice but survived, will be the star witness 
in Deputy Dist. Atty. Mark Pettine's case. 
</P>
<P>
According to Garcia's earlier testimony, a second gunman was at the house the 
night of the killings, but a suspect has never been apprehended. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution will argue that Fonseca had fallen out of favor with the drug 
ring and that he needed money to support his wife. 
</P>
<P>
The defense will argue that Fonseca was in Reno, Nev., with his wife between 
Christmas, 1986, and New Year's Day, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In her opening statements, defense attorney Deborah Carson said she will focus 
on, among other things, the lack of physical evidence linking Fonseca to the 
crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
In his opening statements, Pettine painted a picture of Fonseca as a man who 
was drawn into the underground world of drugs because it offered the Mexican 
national a great deal of money. 
</P>
<P>
Pettine said Fonseca thought more money could be made in the operation, which 
operated out of several houses in Southeast San Diego, and that Fonseca's wife 
was "incurring substantial medical bills she couldn't pay." 
</P>
<P>
After falling out of favor with Partida, Fonseca traveled back and forth from 
San Diego to Reno, where his wife lived, Pettine said. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 28, 1986, Fonseca went to Partida's house, which was the center of the 
drug ring's operations, and he demanded money from two drug ring workers he 
found there, Pettine said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, when the other three victims arrived and he was not given any money, 
Fonseca allegedly herded all five of them into the kitchen, had them lie on the 
floor and shot them, Pettine said.

POWDER SEIZED, 4 ARRESTED IN DRUG RAID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego police confiscated about $33,000 in cash and more than 2 pounds of 
what was believed to be cocaine Monday outside a San Ysidro residence. Four 
people were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
The substance, which would have an estimated street value of $175,000, was 
found in a car parked outside a house in the 3800 block of Beyer Boulevard, a 
police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested about 11:40 a.m. at the house on suspicion of possessing a controlled 
substance for sale were Joel Gay, 31, an unemployed transient; Agustin Magana, 
36, a stable hand who lives at the house; Elena Lazo, 41, who also lives at the 
house, and Abel Herrera, 40, a mechanic from Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, the arrests stemmed from one made about two weeks ago 
after Officers Richard Grano and Boyd Long stopped a pickup truck in the 2200 
block of Ocean View Boulevard in San Diego. Officers found more than 2 pounds 
of marijuana in the truck and arrested the driver. 
</P>
<P>
The driver was not the registered owner of the truck, police said, and on 
Monday the officers went to the address listed for the owner. They found the 
door of the apartment open and could see two men and a woman inside. The two 
men appeared to be making a drug transaction, the police spokesman said, adding 
that one of the men was holding $30,000 worth of new $100 bills in his hand. 
</P>
<P>
The officers could also see a scale with a white, powdery substance on it, the 
spokesman said. Believing a narcotics deal was in progress, the officers 
entered the apartment, where they found two weapons: a .22-caliber, 
semiautomatic pistol containing seven bullets and, in a kitchen drawer, an 
unloaded Colt .45-caliber revolver. 
</P>
<P>
In another room, the officers found several bags containing a small amount of 
white powder that appeared to be cocaine, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the $30,000, the officers seized $3,027 from wallets belonging to the 
four people arrested.

TAKE CARE ON THIS APPOINTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Reagan Administration's attitude toward civil rights was dismal. President 
Bush has quickly set a more positive tone. He has spoken out forcefully on 
civil rights issues; he praised Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as a hero. Such 
symbolic gestures are important, but reversing eight years of hostility will 
take more substantial measures. 
</P>
<P>
Bush can signal his solid commitment by nominating a strong, independent 
attorney who is experienced in civil rights law to head the Justice 
Department's civil rights division. He should consider black Republicans like 
J. Clay Smith Jr., a constitutional law professor at Howard University who was 
a former acting chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission, and 
William H. Brown III, chairman of the EEOC during the Nixon Administration, who 
practices law in Philadelphia. Ralph G. Neas, director of the Leadership 
Conference on Civil Rights, which represents 185 civil rights organizations, is 
also worthy of consideration. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's chief civil rights enforcer deter mines what suits are filed; 
supervises federal education, employment, housing and voting rights cases; 
coordinates the duties of the executive branch, and develops strategy on civil 
rights legislation. The post is not a symbol but the federal government's most 
important civil rights job. U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh has recommended 
William Lucas, a Detroit lawyer, for the job. It is not an inspired choice. 
</P>
<P>
Before he was admitted to the bar, Lucas served briefly in the Kennedy Justice 
Department and then joined the FBI as one of its first black agents. A former 
police officer, he subsequently won elections to the post of sheriff and county 
executive of Wayne County. He failed, however, in a bid for governor of 
Michigan. His experiences qualify him for numerous federal posts, but he simply 
does not have the expertise to handle the nation's top civil rights job. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas has never handled a civil rights case, nor has he had much direct 
involvement in the area. To restore credibility to the civil rights division, 
the White House must make a stronger choice.

INFLATION PRESSURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kuttner failed to mention annual rent increases demanded by landlords of 
residential and commercial property as a major inflationary factor. Today, 
practically every lease for apartments, offices, and other types of property 
contains a clause entitled, "Annual Cost of Living Increase." The terms of the 
agreement give landlords the right to increase rent every year according to the 
cost-of-living index published by the government that usually ranges between 1 
and 7%. 
</P>
<P>
A simple exercise in mathematics should convince anyone that businesses, large 
and small, are compelled to increase their prices of goods and services to 
compensate for this upward adjustment every 12 months. Multiply the outcome of 
this annual increase by the number of residential and commercial tenants forced 
to pay this tithe, and you will obtain a staggering profit for landlords not 
based on principles of supply and demand.

INFLATION PRESSURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Kuttner demonstrates convincingly (Op-Ed Page, March 6) that it is not 
wages and salaries fueling inflation. He cites runaway medical costs, the cheap 
dollar and the federal budget deficit as the sources of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Kuttner omits another source of inflation. That is the bloated defense budget. 
When an economy is growing, even at a rate of 2% (in the last quarter of 1988), 
the production of military goods contributed to inflation. Those military 
goods, such as missiles, tanks, etc. cannot be purchased by consumers nor can 
those goods be purchased by producers for productive machinery. However, 
employees who produce the military goods, stockholders who receive dividends 
from defense industries, use their wages, salaries and dividends to purchase 
consumer goods or capital goods -- not missiles or tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore we have an imbalance; too much money income chasing too few 
consumption goods and productive machinery. Put another way, there is "excess 
purchasing power." As Kuttner states, the danger is that the Federal Reserve 
will try to chill the economy -- squeeze out "excess purchasing power" -- with 
any "icy bath of tight money." In other words, the Fed will induce a recession 
and unemployment, a very "icy bath" for millions of people. 
</P>
<P>
A more constructive and equitable policy would be to cut the deficit by 
reducing the bloated defense budget and increasing taxes on the very high 
income groups.

It is a heartening tribute to the resourcefulness of U.S. chemical companies 
that they have suitable substitutes for ozone-shredding chlorofluorocarbons 
waiting in the wings. (Does anyone doubt that they'll be considerably more 
expensive than the current culprits?) 
</P>
<P>
But wait! Could we use this crisis to find out the awful truths about the 
possible toxic, carcinogenic, environmental or otherwise hazardous effects of 
these new substance now, before another couple of decades roll by? I want full, 
impartial disclosure on these chemicals just as I expect it in foodstuffs, 
medicines, or household cleaners. In the light of this experience, to assume 
harmlessness is naivest folly.

THE 'SIN' OF APARTHEID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The white branch of the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa has found 
apartheid a "sin" four years after officially rejecting the concept of racial 
segregation, a finding that will at least postpone a formal break with the 
larger black and mixed-race branches of the church. But the white branch has 
once again shied away from agreement on tactics, such as civil disobedience, 
that have been proposed to accelerate the glacial progress away from apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
"We confess with humility and sorrow the participation of our church in the 
introduction and legitimation of the ideology of apartheid and the subsequent 
suffering of people," the new church statement declares, helpful words at a 
time of deep soul searching in the nation. And the leaders of the black and 
mixed-race divisions of the Dutch Reformed Church were quick to appreciate the 
reconciliation inherent in the agreed words. They were also frank, however, in 
pointing out the problems that remain to reunite the church. 
</P>
<P>
"Those belonging to the world of the oppressor could not hear or understand the 
cries and anger of those living in the world of the oppressed," the Rev. Nico 
Smith, writing in the Sunday Times of South Africa, commented after the 
meeting. He is a prominent Afrikaner minister in the Reformed Church who left 
the white branch to lead a parish in a black township near Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
His disappointment reflected the disillusionment that has followed so many 
official rejections of apartheid. The rejections have not been matched by 
substantial progress toward reform. Apartheid is officially opposed by the 
government of South Africa and by most political forces. Only the far-right 
Conservative Party, which advocates firm restoration of racial segregation, 
remains actively committed to apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
The statement of the separate divisions of the Dutch Reformed Church coincided 
with two other events of potential importance: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The South African Law Commission called for an end to the laws that still 
enforce apartheid, and also urged that the black majority be given full voting 
rights in national elections, the first such recommendations from an official 
government organ, and 
</P>
<P>
 -- The governing National Party pressed its efforts to replace the ailing 
Pieter W. Botha as president of South Africa with the new party leader, 
Frederik W. de Klerk, who might speed the slow pace of reform initiated by 
Botha. 
</P>
<P>
A critical test of government intentions will come in the days ahead, when 
there will be pressure to respond to the call of the Reformed Church to end the 
state of emergency and to free the hundreds, including children, being held 
without charges. The black and mixed-race majority within the Reformed Church 
will judge the real meaning of the new statement by the willingness of their 
white fellow church members to support the real ending of apartheid.

CAMP DAVID FORMULA AWAITS REDISCOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZE'EV B. BEGIN, Ze'ev B. Begin is a Likud member of the Israeli Knesset and 
chairman of its subcommittee on security. He is the son of former Prime 
Minister Menachem Begin, who negotiated the Camp David agreement. 
</P>

JERUSALEM 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is suitable to open a current political discussion on the troubled Middle 
East with a reference to the literary world. The sentencing to death of someone 
like Salman Rushdie by Islamic fundamentalists is a reminder that Israel has 
always been fighting for survival in the actual zone of collision between 
Western civilization and a violent Islamic political subculture. The amazing 
experiment in transplanting the 7th-Century concept of jihad, or holy war, to 
the 20th Century was tried on the Jewish state of "nonbelievers" while it was 
still in its cradle. 
</P>
<P>
This incessant attempt to annihilate Israel has found new ways, now aiming at 
the establishment of a PLO terrorist state in Judea, Samaria and the Gaza 
district. It would, no doubt, serve as a launching pad for expansion: first 
eastward, eliminating King Hussein, and then westward, liquidating Israel, with 
the backing of more than 11,000 tanks and 1.9 million soldiers stationed in the 
four Arab countries east of the Jordan River. No Israeli or American in his 
right mind should agree to the establishment of another version of Libya only 
50 miles south of Syria, either directly or by proxy or by default. And since 
Israelis understand the nature of this threat, most of them would rather be 
unjustly criticized than be poetically eulogized. 
</P>
<P>
Regrettably, the surge in U.S. diplomatic activism has not positively 
contributed to the cause of peace in the Middle East. Starting with the 
American tendency to consider the Soviet-born concept of an international 
tribunal on the Middle East, it continued in the March 4, 1988, Shultz 
document, which voided the essential transitional period embodied in the Camp 
David accords; this suggested that the United States is considering divorcing 
itself from the accords. It culminated in the U.S. initiation of dialogue with 
the PLO mur derers, legitimizing both the Arab violence directed against Jews 
in the Land of Israel and the PLO terrorist raids across the Israel-Lebanon 
border. All in all, by yielding to Arab pressure, the United States signaled to 
the Arab jihadists that time is on their side, thus rendering the situation far 
less ripe for solution than it could be. The Soviet foreign minister's recent 
embrace of both Syria and the PLO and his harsh words about sanctions proved 
again that anything you can do he can do better. 
</P>
<P>
In view of these dire straits, the creativity of the Camp David compromise, as 
initiated by Israel a decade ago, is outstanding. As too many people reject it 
outright, it may be helpful here to give a quick sketch of the framework for 
peace in the Middle East as agreed to by the United States, Israel and Egypt: 
</P>
<P>
* Israel will be responsible for its security in the whole area west of the 
Jordan River. 
</P>
<P>
* The Arab inhabitants of Samaria, Judea and Gaza will enjoy autonomy through a 
freely elected self-governing authority. 
</P>
<P>
* As a substantial confidence-building measure, that authority will be in 
effect for a transitional period of five years. Within this period, the final 
status of Judea, Samaria and the Gaza district will be negotiated. The 
agreement on the final status will be an integral part of the comprehensive 
peace treaty between Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
We have a clear position concerning Judea, Samaria and the Gaza district: They 
are part of Eretz Yisreal, the Land of Israel; it belongs, by right, to the 
Jewish people; we must keep it, we intend to keep it and we shall keep it. 
However, we are aware that others have their own claims for the same areas. 
</P>
<P>
In this context, the Camp David compromise offers the transitional period as a 
mechanism to defer resolution of the complex issue of sovereignty, with the 
hope that building mutual confidence will render the situation more manageable 
and the problems riper for solution. It is important to note that the framework 
is open-ended. There is nothing in the accord itself that precludes any agreed 
solution for the final status of the disputed areas. 
</P>
<P>
It has become fashionable to label the Camp David achievement as junk. Not only 
is this shortsighted, it also indicates a short memory. It may surprise some 
that as late as January, 1988, in an interview with the Kuwaiti newspaper 
Al-Anaba, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak offered the following pertinent 
observations: 
</P>
<P>
"Camp David includes two documents, one for the solution of the 
Egyptian-Israeli problem and the other, which is the general framework of 
principles according to which the Palestinian problem is to be solved in all 
its aspects. That is, this is not a binding agreement but a method for a 
solution on which we shall agree through general points. The first document 
ended in the Egyptian-Israeli treaty and the return of the Sinai to Egypt. As 
for the second document, concerning the resolution of the Palestinian problem 
in all its aspects, when we discussed it with the Israelis, I realized that our 
brothers attacked Egypt because she tried to reach a solution of the 
Palestinian problem. Had we continued the talks on the second framework of Camp 
David, we would have been in a better situation, in stages." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, indeed. In the last decade, no substantially new ideas were offered to 
alleviate the difficulties in our corner of the Middle East. The Camp David 
compromise still rises high above any of the non-starter formulas, being 
practical, gradual, generous and wise. It should be given a fresh look and a 
new chance.

EX-EMPLOYEE, AWARDED $9 MILLION, MUST PAY $600,000 TO COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAYERENE BARKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A former employee of a Tarzana medical testing firm, who last week was awarded 
$9 million in a lawsuit against the company, was ordered Monday to pay his 
ex-employer $600,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors had sided with employee Harvey J. Lippman in the suit, which argued that 
he was entitled to a 20% share of the company at the time he was fired. The 
$9-million verdict last Tuesday was one of the largest awards in Van Nuys 
Superior Court history, said Judge Thomas Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
But on Monday, jurors also decided that Lippman had misappropriated trade 
secrets and unfairly competed against his former employer, Central Diagnostic 
Laboratories, and ordered him to pay $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was the culmination of a trial that has lasted since Jan. 18. 
</P>
<P>
Lippman filed the suit against the company in October, 1985, after he was fired 
by the firm's owner, Dr. Allen M. Levy. Lippman, who had worked for the firm 
for 14 years, claimed that he was entitled to 20% of the company because of an 
oral agreement with Levy. 
</P>
<P>
In turn, Levy's attorney, Allan Browne, filed a cross complaint against Lippman 
alleging misappropriation of trade secrets and unfair competition. The jury 
ruled against a slander charge Levy filed against Lippman. 
</P>
<P>
Don Howarth, Lippman's attorney, maintained that Levy fired Lippman to avoid 
giving him 20% of the company, an oral commitment the attorney said Levy agreed 
to in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Lippman described his relationship with Levy as one of father and son. "He made 
a promise to me and I trusted him," he said Monday outside of court. 
</P>
<P>
Browne, argued that since Lippman, 46, could produce no written document, the 
oral agreement was not valid. He also maintained that his client fired Lippman 
when he discovered that his employee was using the firm's client lists and 
other assets to establish his own company. 
</P>
<P>
Lippman said he has since founded another medical testing firm, Clinical 
Science Laboratory of North Hollywood, but denied doing so while working for 
Levy. 
</P>
<P>
Howarth said that as head of marketing for the firm, Lippman had build the 
company from one that employed only nine workers in 1970 to a major business 
that has about 900 employees and grossed $45 million in 1985, the year his 
client was fired. 
</P>
<P>
"I now feel that justice has been served," Lippman said after the verdict. "I'm 
very happy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appeal Planned 
</P>
<P>
Levy was not in court Monday afternoon and was unavailable for comment. But 
Browne indicated his client will appeal the $9-million award. "This is only 
round one of a 10-round battle," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Browne said he found the $9-million award "hopelessly inconsistent" with the 
jury's award of $600,000 to the company Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Jury foreman William B. Cummings said the 11-1 verdict came after three days of 
deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
"We were convinced a verbal agreement had been made," he said. Cummings called 
Lippman's job performance exemplary. 
</P>
<P>
He said the jury arrived at the $9-million figure by taking 20% of $45 million, 
the amount the company grossed in 1985, the year Lippman was terminated. 
</P>
<P>
Central Diagnostic Laboratories has other problems too. Last month, federal 
health authorities decertified one of its subsidiaries, Central Pathology 
Services Medical Group, Southern California's largest Pap smear laboratory, 
saying it had misdiagnosed too many specimens.

TEACHER STABBED BY STUDENT FEARS RETURN TO CLASSROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Olive Vista Junior High School teacher Cynthia Edwards said Monday that she 
shudders when thinking about returning to the classroom where she was stabbed a 
week ago by one of her students. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to cry a lot," said Edwards, 37, in a telephone interview. "I keep 
asking myself, 'Why? What did I do except try to teach?' " 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, who is recovering at home after being released from the hospital 
Friday, said she was reviewing Homer's "The Odyssey" shortly after lunch on 
March 6 when she was attacked by a 15-year-old boy who had been a disciplinary 
problem since transfering into her fifth-period English class in February. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, whose name is being withheld because of his age, has been charged with 
assault with a deadly weapon. At a hearing Thursday, a juvenile court judge 
said that the boy had shown several students a knife and told them he was going 
to attack Edwards. He is being held at Sylmar Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"He was having a disagreement with another young fellow, using a lot of 
profanity," said Edwards, who taught in two East Los Angeles junior high 
schools for 10 years before tranferring to the Sylmar school in September. 
</P>
<P>
The day before, the boy had been assigned to write "I will be quiet in Period 5 
classes" 125 times as punishment for repeatedly speaking out of turn, Edwards 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The class was working but he kept interrupting," Edwards said. "One student 
doesn't have the right to interrupt the whole class, so I attempted to get rid 
of him as quickly as possible, but evidently I didn't work quickly enough." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards said she began writing an office referral on the boy that included a 
request to speak with his parents when she noticed him approaching her desk. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt a pain in my shoulder and I assumed that he hit me," Edwards said. "He 
looked around at the classroom and then ran out . . . . One of my students came 
up and said, 'You have a knife in your back.' " 
</P>
<P>
Edwards said she has made no plans about returning to work. She said the attack 
shows how teachers in the Los Angeles Unified School District need protection 
such as emergency telephones in classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had a phone, I could have called security to get the student out of the 
classroom without having to take the five or six minutes to write the referral 
and let him hurt me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A little more than half of the district's 600 or so schools, including Olive 
Vista, have some type of intercom system that link classrooms to the main 
office, district officials said. But no more than 25 schools have emergency 
telephones that can be programmed to signal an emergency immediately to school 
officials, said Rod Macdonell, the district's electrical supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, who had an emergency telephone in her classroom last year while 
teaching at Stevenson Junior High School in East Los Angeles, said the Olive 
Vista intercom system is too cumbersome to use in emergencies. Teachers there 
must push a button and wait for an office secretary to notice a flashing light 
and then go to another room to answer the call using a special telephone, 
school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
District spokeswoman Diana Munatones said the district had considered a plan to 
put telephones in every classroom but dropped the idea because of the high 
cost. "If we had the funds, we would do it," she said.

PUPILS ORDERED TO LEAVE PRESCHOOL EVICTION HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 20 squirming and whispering youngsters, carrying banners that protested 
the possible closing of their preschool, were forced to leave an Encino 
municipal courtroom Monday afternoon when a court commissioner tired of their 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"Children are going to have to exit the courtroom at this time," said 
Commissioner Joseph R. Ruffner. "Five- and 6-year-olds and 4-year-olds, this is 
no place for them." 
</P>
<P>
Ruffner also seemed dissatisfied with evidence presented in defense of Escuela 
de la Gente, a publicly funded Pacoima preschool attended by 75 students, 20 of 
whom were brought to court by their mothers and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
As the hearing dragged on into the late afternoon, he said, "We're really not 
going anywhere here." 
</P>
<P>
Property owner Keith Marcovitch wants to sell the property at 13545 Van Nuys 
Boulevard to a mini-mall developer. The school was issued an eviction order in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators of Escuela de la Gente -- "School of the People" -- said they 
hope to appeal to the court's social conscience so that the school can stay at 
the site at least four more months. The school is completing arrangements to 
move into a nearby church, they said. An earlier arrangement with another 
church fell through in October. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of these parents are single, working mothers," said school director Ruben 
Rodriguez. He also said that if the school is forced to move in less than four 
months, it may have to close. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Offer to Stay Alleged 
</P>
<P>
Attorney David A. Rothberg, representing the school, attempted to convince 
Ruffner that the 30-day eviction notice issued in December was invalid. He said 
that Marcovitch made an offer to let the school stay on twice that long at the 
same time the eviction notice was filed. 
</P>
<P>
Rothberg also told the court that Marcovitch had suggested the school could 
probably remain at the location six to nine more months while preparations are 
made for construction of the mini-mall. 
</P>
<P>
"They were lulled into complacency, thinking they had that time to move," 
Rothberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Repeatedly during the hearing, Ruffner agreed with Marcovitch's attorneys that 
Rothberg's line of questioning was irrelevant. The hearing was continued until 
this afternoon because a witness for the school did not show up. 
</P>
<P>
During his testimony, Marcovitch said offers to allow the school to stay at the 
location beyond January were contingent on school administrators allowing 
construction work to begin. When they would not agree to that, Marcovitch said 
he was compelled to bring eviction proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody feels good about doing what has to be done," said Steven M. Harrison, 
one of Marcovitch's attorneys.

REFLECTIONS: 'I'M PROBABLY THE MOST INDEPENDENT-DEPENDENT PERSON IN THE WORLD.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PERRY C. RIDDLE

Lee Seitz won the battle against confinement when she got her first motorized 
wheelchair more than 20 years ago. She works at the Polio Survivors Foundation 
office to expand the lives of people who are confined and to help others who 
are affected by post-polio syndrome. Seitz, 61, lives in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 I contracted polio in August of 1951. I was 24, and my daughter had just 
turned 4. The older you are when you get a disease like this, the harder it is 
on you. I was completely paralyzed. It's the fever that does the damage. It's 
like a soldering iron. It actually solders together the motor nerves at the 
base of the brain. 
</P>
<P>
I was in the hospital for two years. I was in the big iron lung, and they told 
me that I would never get out of it. I could never have spent my life in 
something like that, so I graduated to a small respirator that I could have at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
It was very hopeless. You question why it had to happen to you. I was very 
active before. I loved to dance, loved to skate. Of course, my husband didn't 
like being tied down to a handicap. So he became a drinker, which happened in a 
lot of cases. We were divorced when my daughter was 7. It was difficult, a lot 
of adjusting. But I went through the adjusting years ago. 
</P>
<P>
I was never the type to be shut in, but for 15 years that's what I was, shut 
in. I didn't really have much hope of any future until I got this motor chair. 
The day I got my motor wheelchair, I got in it, and I've never stopped. I'm not 
kidding, it just opens up the whole world. I'm probably the most independent- 
dependent person in the world. Once I'm in my chair, the whole world is mine. 
They just set it up so that I can operate it with my toe. 
</P>
<P>
I can go within a radius of five miles, so I go to the market, I can get to a 
shopping center. I try to get up to the Polio Survivors Foundation office by 11 
o'clock every day, and I stay there until 3. 
</P>
<P>
I think it was 1984 when I first started getting letters and phone calls from 
all of these people, nationwide. They were all starting to go through this 
post-polio syndrome. The doctors didn't know what was going on, and so they 
were telling each one of them that it was all in their minds, sending them to 
psychiatrists. The standard reply that I would get from each one of them was: 
"Thank God, it's not all in my mind. I thought I was going crazy." 
</P>
<P>
They are people who contracted polio when they were children and now they're in 
their middle 30s to late 40s, and they're starting to go through these terrible 
dramatic changes. They're losing use of their limbs. Some of them are having to 
go into breathing equipment. 
</P>
<P>
When they were young, they felt like they'd really beat the rap. Now they find 
that this is happening, it is worse, because there's no way they can turn it 
around. It's scary. 
</P>
<P>
I've had men call me, crying, not knowing what he's going to do. That's a hard 
thing, hearing a man cry. He's head of a family, and now he's got no hopes at 
all. That's why we started the support groups. 
</P>
<P>
There are so many people out there who still don't know that they're going 
through this syndrome. They're being treated for bursitis, arthritis, every 
kind of "itis" you can think of. It's sad because they're the people we need to 
reach. If they change their life style, maybe they can live a lot longer and it 
won't get become severe. Right now there are over 100,000 polio survivors in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
I think our group has done a good job with the little we've been able to raise. 
We're achieving a lot for what we can. We raised $29,000 last year, and we 
spent $25,000 on polio, which is a pretty good showing. We feel good about 
that. 
</P>
<P>
I guess I feel good every day of my life. I feel good that I'm able to help. It 
makes me feel wonderful when I see that I've had a part in helping somebody 
change their way of life. 
</P>
<P>
I love to see people who've been stuck in the house for years get a motor 
chair. I know how wonderful it makes them feel. It's very gratifying.

REGIS HOUSE HELPS YOUNG, OLD ALIKE; 
</P>
<P>
CATHOLIC CENTER AN URBAN HAVEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When they need after-school child care, language classes or just somewhere to 
meet with friends, about 400 families on the Westside have a refuge in Regis 
House. 
</P>
<P>
For 40 years, the family oriented community center run by an order of Catholic 
nuns has served hundreds of predominantly Latino families in the Sawtelle area 
of West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Our philosophy is to build self-esteem, to give a sense of purpose and meaning 
to those who sometimes feel their lives are empty and hopeless," said Sister 
Jennifer Gaeta, Regis House director. "We strive to eliminate or at least 
lessen outside forces, which weaken the unity and cohesiveness of the family." 
</P>
<P>
What sets Regis House apart from many other community centers is that it 
operates without financial support from the government. 
</P>
<P>
The center is run by the Sisters of Social Service, an 80-year-old Roman 
Catholic order of social workers. 
</P>
<P>
It gets most of its $190,000 annual budget from the Juniors of Social Service 
Auxiliary. The balance of the budget is raised through donations and fees that 
participants are charged based on their ability to pay. 
</P>
<P>
Among the services provided in the single-story building at 11346 Iowa Ave. are 
a preschool program; after-school clubs, tutoring and sports, and a program for 
teen-agers that includes evening recreational activities, after-school and 
summer employment, and a summer day camp. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Adult Clubs Offered 
</P>
<P>
For adults, there is a mothers club, a senior citizens club, and classes in 
cooking, sewing, English and civics. 
</P>
<P>
The center assists people with medical care and Social Security problems, and 
provides translation and help to immigrants filling out applications for 
permanent residency or citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
Regis House also works with Westside food banks to provide meals to the needy 
and gives referrals to people needing temporary shelter. 
</P>
<P>
The success of the center was recognized recently by the West Los Angeles Lions 
Club, which named Gaeta its Citizen of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
At the awards ceremony, several local elected officials sent congratulatory 
messages, but Los Angeles City Councilman Marvin Braude, who represents the 
area, appeared in person. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't normally attend these things," he said, "but I wanted to say in person 
that this center is doing something in a very direct and meaningful way." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Made a Difference 
</P>
<P>
Jack Moscowitz, principal of nearby University High School, said the center has 
made a difference with some of his students. 
</P>
<P>
"My experience goes back to 1959 to 1971, when I was a teacher at Uni," 
Moscowitz said. "Regis House is a very positive, supportive agency working with 
the young people in the area." 
</P>
<P>
Although the number of families in the community continues to dwindle as homes 
are demolished to make way for commercial buildings, Gaeta says the need for 
social services is growing and the center's programs remain full. 
</P>
<P>
"The needs of this community are far greater than our ability to meet," said 
Gaeta, who has worked at Regis House for nine years, the last three as 
director. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent morning, about 20 Latinas -- members of a womens club that meets 
weekly -- sat at a table playing bingo. 
</P>
<P>
Rosemary Lechuga, who took part in the center's activities for 10 years before 
becoming a full-time staff member five years ago, said many of the women got 
involved in the club after their children began participating in Regis House 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Time Away From Home 
</P>
<P>
Lechuga said the purpose of the club is to give the women at least one day a 
week away from their husbands and children, and to attempt to chip away some of 
the machismo that still pervades Latino culture. 
</P>
<P>
The women in the group, nearly all of whom speak little English, receive 
information on medical care, mental health and finances. They take field trips 
to such places as the J. Paul Getty Museum, Farmers Market and Universal 
Studios. 
</P>
<P>
"This is fun," said Esperanza Martin, who has been attending meetings for 21 
years. "And it allows us a chance to dress up at least once a week." 
</P>
<P>
Hilda Mokay, who has been attending meetings for four years, said the field 
trips allow them to visit places they might not otherwise see. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of our husbands would have complained about us going to these places on 
our own," Mokay said. 
</P>
<P>
"But going with Regis House, for some reason, makes it OK with them." 
</P>
<P>
The youth programs are designed to give children and teen-agers an alternative 
to gangs, and to encourage them to get an education, Gaeta said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't ever try to talk the kids out of their gang identity because I believe 
that it is just that, a large part of their identity," she said. "But I have 
always tried to help them see the consequences of their actions and to look for 
alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Place for Youth 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza (Espi) Martin, 19, began participating in activities at Regis House 
when she was 12. Now she is a paid part-time staff member, working as a tutor 
and girl's club leader. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said that when she was younger, Regis House offered her a place to go 
when she wanted to get out of the house and away from her parents. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming here reassured my parents that I was not just hanging out on the 
streets," she said. "I think it has helped a lot of kids stay off the streets." 
</P>
<P>
As he dashed into the center to pick up his 9-year-old daughter, Fernando 
Aguirre said Regis House workers have helped his teen-age son with his 
homework, and the low-cost after-school program allows him and his wife to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't speak or read English very well," Aguirre said in Spanish, "so I'm not 
always able to help my son with his homework. The tutoring he gets here has 
been great. The evening and weekend programs are also great, particularly with 
the increase in gang activity here. I think Regis House has just helped 
tremendously."

REMEMBERING MICKEY; 
</P>
<P>
MANTLE'S HOME RUNS TRANSCEND TIME, SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIRLEY POVICH, Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was at this point in spring training, 20 years ago, that he stood before the 
microphones set up I in the Yankees' hotel suite and said: "I can't hit the 
ball anymore, and I can't steal second when I need to anymore, and I can't go 
from first to third anymore . . . and I think it's time to quit trying." 
</P>
<P>
He also might have said, and he wouldn't be lying, that no more would he be 
hitting the league's most and longest homers, or winning any more MVP awards of 
which there were three, and he wouldn't be scoring the most runs anymore, or 
driving in the most, and no more would he be the best drag bunter in baseball. 
Things like that. 
</P>
<P>
This, of course, was Mickey Mantle, saying goodby to the game that made him 
famous, and vice versa. He was telling the Yankees' management and the rest of 
the world that, at 37, he was packing it in, surrendering at last to the enemy 
of all his baseball years, his sorely abused, crybaby knees. 
</P>
<P>
They had plagued him since his rookie year with the Yankees when, in the second 
game of the 1951 World Series, he stepped into a drainage hole, twisted a knee, 
and was carried from the field on a stretcher, never to return to that series. 
</P>
<P>
He would later hit more World Series home runs, 18, than any man of his time, 
or before, or since. This was the Mickey Mantle who was now saying he couldn't 
play the game anymore. A giant was leaving the baseball scene. 
</P>
<P>
Always there were discussions about who hit the longest homers, usually with 
the agreement that Babe Ruth was No. 1. It was Walter Johnson who once put 
Ruth's homers in perspective when he was asked to compare Ruth and Jimmie Foxx 
and Hank Greenberg. Whose hits were the longest? Said Johnson: "All I can say 
is that the balls Ruth hit out of the park got smaller quicker than anybody 
else's." 
</P>
<P>
So where did Mantle fit in? In all his years Ruth never hit one over the high, 
concrete bleachers in left center field in Griffith Stadium in Washington. But 
of course he hit left-handed. Greenberg and Foxx had their shots at it, and it 
never happened. But one April afternoon in 1955, against the Senators' Chuck 
Stobbs, Mickey Mantle made it happen. By yards and yards his swat cleared those 
bleachers and sailed into Fifth Street beyond. After a measuring they came up 
with the opinion it was a masterly 565-foot production. 
</P>
<P>
The late Clark Griffith, owner of the Senators, put the Mantle homer in 
perspective when it was suggested to him that a prevailing wind helped the 
shot. "Consarn it, I don't care about that," Griffith said. "That same wind has 
been blowing for 100 years, and nobody else ever hit one out of there." 
</P>
<P>
When Mantle quit he didn't say that another Yankee dynasty had ended, because 
he didn't talk in those terms, but he could have. His had been the latest of 
the Yankee eras, in which one majestic performer had carried the team. First, 
it was the Babe Ruth era, then the longtime Joe DiMaggio phase of the Yankees. 
To whom would the torch be passed? Who could qualify for the greatness of the 
role? He would answer to the name of Mickey Mantle. 
</P>
<P>
He had come to the Yankees as the shy kid from the Oklahoma sandlots, with a 
blond cowlick, and offering his uncommon combination of muscle plus speed. He 
had also licked, he thought, a boyhood bout with the bone disease, 
osteomyelitis. In high school he had played football, too, and in later years a 
teammate who had remembered him then said of Mantle's speed, "Despite his good 
weight, he was lightfooted. It seemed he ran on top of the grass." 
</P>
<P>
Four times he led the AL in homers, but ironically he didn't in his most 
productive year when he slammed 54. That was when teammate Roger Maris hit 
those 61 to break Ruth's record. Some folks tried to make a thing of rivalry 
between Mantle and Maris that season, but Mickey was having none of it. "Roger 
is my friend," he said. "If I don't hit 61, I hope he does." 
</P>
<P>
He didn't need a home run to establish him as the home run giant of his times. 
Remembered is the 1956 World Series against Brooklyn, when a total of 16 homers 
were hit by all the players. Three were by Mantle. Those three were the longest 
three of the Series. 
</P>
<P>
He was the rarest combination of home run slugger and deft bunter who ever hit 
the big leagues. His specialty was the drag bunt, a thing of beauty in itself 
and now threatening to become a lost art. He could manage it with his hands and 
speed, when, as a switch hitter he chose to bat left-handed. From manager Casey 
Stengel, he had a blank check to drag one whenever he liked. On a two-strike 
count even. It would be risky, if not damn foolishness, for anybody else. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago Mickey arrived in the Yankees' camp as a hitting instructor, 
met an old friend, and inquired about his golf game. In turn, Mantle, now a 
golf fanatic, was asked about his own game. "I'm hitting the ball well but I 
can't score," he said. What was wrong? "It's my putting," Mantle said. 
</P>
<P>
In a bases-loaded, two-strike situation in the ninth with the 60,000 in the 
park on the edge of their seats in high excitement, Mantle always seemed the 
calmest fellow in the place with the bat on his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"So, Mickey, what's wrong with your putting?" he was asked. "Hell," Mickey 
said, "I'm gutless." In addition to making a commentary on golf, he seemed to 
be saying baseball was his game.

SHOW VOICES CONCERN OVER BACK TROUBLE; 
</P>
<P>
PITCHER SAYS HE'LL CONTINUE TO WORK, BUT HE HAS LIMITS

<P>
Eric Show, three weeks before he will surely be the Padres' opening-day 
starting pitcher, has begun complaining about lower back pains caused by what 
was diagnosed in January as a bulging disc. 
</P>
<P>
Although Show has proven he can pitch well in his condition -- he was 
outstanding Monday in pitching a three-hit shutout over six innings against the 
Milwaukee Brewers -- he says he is in pain at other times and will wonder about 
the back until it is tested over a full-game situation. He threw about 60 
pitches Monday. He would normally throw around 110. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fine now, but the minute it affects my motion or my delivery or any of 
that, I'm going to see what needs to be done," Show said Monday. "I will pitch 
with pain -- I've pitched with fractured fingers, broken toes. But I will not 
pitch where it is hurting the team or myself." 
</P>
<P>
Although Show said an option would be the same kind of surgery performed on San 
Francisco quarterback Joe Montana -- "I could be back in four to six weeks, 
good as new," he said -- his doctor said such talk is premature. 
</P>
<P>
"His is not a surgical lesion, that's not where it's at right now," said Dr. 
Daniel Denenberg, a San Diego orthopedic surgeon who performed a test which 
revealed Show's condition. 
</P>
<P>
Denenberg said the bulging disc could have been there for quite some time, 
perhaps even throughout last summer when Show led the Padres with a 16-11 
record and 3.26 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
"Our findings are that the disc is irritated, but it's not something that just 
occurred," Denenberg said. "It's been there for a while, and been compatible 
with his well-being. He's obviously performed with it. 
</P>
<P>
"It just started bothering him, so we took a look. The thing now is to wait and 
see." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the waiting is easy, as in Monday's game, in which Show put up the 
best numbers of any Padre starter this year, striking out four and walking two. 
The Padres wound up losing his 4-0 lead when reliever Greg Booker put up the 
spring's worst numbers, allowing eight runs (seven earned) in two innings in an 
eventual 8-4 loss. 
</P>
<P>
"If Show's back is hurt and he throws like that, maybe his back should stay 
hurt," Manager Jack McKeon said. "Seriously, Show looks fine to us, and we are 
not worried." 
</P>
<P>
Other times, though, the waiting is hard. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt great today," Show said. "But tomorrow, I'll be hurting. I'll be 
walking around like . . . " 
</P>
<P>
He stuck out his hand as if holding an imaginary cane and began hobbling around 
his locker. 
</P>
<P>
"On certain movements, it just hurts," Show said. "Like bending over." 
</P>
<P>
Show first complained of the soreness in January, and underwent tests that 
revealed the problem, but caused little worry. Show noted, "About 80% of the 
people in this country have bulging discs, and it's no problem for most of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Both he and his agent, Steve Greenberg, were asked about the back during the 
first week of camp, and both denied any serious problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the soreness would go away," Show said, "but it hasn't." 
</P>
<P>
Yet teammates recently noticed Show complaining of the pain during everyday 
situations, such as riding the team bus. Show said his problem now is believing 
that pain won't occur on the field. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to get rid of it as far as the psychological aspects are concerned," 
Show said. "I've got to go six or seven innings and see if it's fine." 
</P>
<P>
And if it's not fine? "I'll do my best to ignore it," Show said, "but only to a 
point where I can't ignore it." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Dobson, Padre pitching coach, said that as far as Show's position in the 
rotation was concerned, Dobson also would ignore the back pains. 
</P>
<P>
"I check with him about it all the time, but it doesn't seem to bother him once 
he gets loose, so I won't do anything until he comes to me," Dobson said. "I 
think maybe it's tough on him the day after he pitches, and I bet that if he 
gets involved in any long innings in the cold, it could be a problem. But we'll 
just get a hot pack on him while he's on the bench and that should take care of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Dobson and the other coaches met with McKeon over dinner Monday night to 
discuss roster moves and, among other things, the opening day starter April 3 
in San Diego against San Francisco. By virtue of his career-best performance 
last season, Show was a lock for the job the minute he stepped into camp, and 
still is a lock. He has looked decent in all three spring outings, going 1-0 
with a 3.75 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
"Do I want to be the opening day starter? Sure," Show said. "Somebody has to 
start the season so, sure, why not?" 
</P>
<P>
If Show's season in interrupted because of back problems, minor league star 
Greg Harris, who was 2-0 with a 1.50 ERA in three appearances with the Padres 
last fall, appears ready for a shot at a rotation he now cannot crack. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Although Eric Show's back condition could change things, pitching coach Pat 
Dobson revealed Monday that the club might go with only nine pitchers instead 
of the standard 10. "Why not? If we have our starters going so many innings 
like last year, what do we need the extra bullpen man for?" Dobson asked. Such 
a switch would allow the Padres to keep an extra utility man -- maybe backup 
shortstop candidates Mike Brumley and Gary Green could both make the team. 
Green was given an inning at third base Monday. The losing pitcher could be 
rookie Greg Harris, who is scheduled to make the team in the bullpen even 
though he is a starter, just for the big-league exposure and in case a starter 
were injured. . . . Monday's loss dropped the Padres' spring record to 6-4-1 
while shooting Greg Booker's spring ERA to 20.25 -- nine earned runs in four 
innings. Carmelo Martinez hit his third homer of the spring, a two-run shot in 
the fifth. . . . The Padres play two more games in the Phoenix area before 
returning to Yuma for their remaining nine home games begining Friday at 7:05 
against San Francisco. McKeon has scheduled a "B" game with the Giants 
beginning at 3 p.m. Friday at Desert Sun Stadium.

HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
SAN DIEGO HIGH SCORES 10 RUNS IN FIRST TO DEFEAT CORONADO, 16-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego High School baseball team wasn't fazed when a line drive double 
play in the first inning wasted a leadoff triple. The Cavers, who trailed by a 
run, went on to score 10 runs in the inning and routed visiting Coronado, 16-3, 
Monday in pool play of the Grossmont Metro City tournament. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego (3-1) used six hits, four walks and three Coronado errors to send 14 
players to the plate in the first. San Diego scored in each of the first five 
innings. The game was called after the fifth because of darkness. Coronado is 
2-2. 
</P>
<P>
Kian Sly had a two-run homer in the fourth and finished three for three with a 
triple and four RBIs. Josh Stepner went the distance for the victory, allowing 
three hits. 
</P>
<P>
In another tournament game: 
</P>
<P>
El Cajon Valley 6, La Jolla Country Day 3 -- Fred Earnst went two for three 
with a double and an RBI triple and Donny Frost was two for three to lead El 
Cajon Valley (2-2). John Hayward (1-1) pitched six innings for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Pirate tournament 
</P>
<P>
Fallbrook 7, Grossmont 2 -- Wade Pearson hit a grand slam as Fallbrook won at 
home. Pearson was two for three for Fallbrook (3-1) and is nine for 14 with 
nine RBIs this season. David Michaelian was three for three with two RBIs for 
Fallbrook. Left-hander Mike Gainesborough (1-1) allowed two hits in 4 1/3 
innings for the victory. Grossmont is 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
Madison Warhawk tournament 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater 4, Point Loma 2 -- Two errors led to a run and Juan Lopez's 
sacrifice fly to right in the fifth inning broke a 2-2 tie for Sweetwater (4-2) 
at home. Reliever Issac Bruce (2-1) struck out six in five innings for the 
victory. Point Loma led, 2-0, with two runs in the top of the second, but 
Sweetwater rallied to tie the score in the bottom of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Glen 13, Mt. Miguel 5 -- Matt Taylor hit a three-run homer as Orange 
Glen trailed, 3-1, after two innings. Orange Glen (4-2), however, scored four 
runs in the third and five in the fifth for the victory at Mt. Miguel. Scott 
Coleman and winning pitcher Jim Roby (1-1) had two-run singles in the fifth.

PEOPLE: DREXEL FINANCE CHIEF SHIFTED TO 'JUNK BOND' UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. has moved its West Coast finance chief, John 
Kissick, over to work full time in the firm's "junk bond" department in Beverly 
Hills, underscoring the probability that he will replace Michael Milken as head 
of the department when Milken leaves Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
The likelihood that Kissick would be named to succeed Milken if Milken's legal 
problems forced him out of the firm was first reported several months ago. 
Under terms of tentative settlement agreements that Drexel has reached with the 
federal prosecutors in New York and with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Milken will be required to leave Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel also announced some related personnel moves, including the appointment 
of Herbert Bachelor as a vice chairman with responsibility for investment 
banking and related activities. Bachelor previously was head of corporate 
finance at Drexel. Bachelor is among the executives Drexel promoted in an 
effort to retain after the firm's internally divisive decision to settle with 
prosecutors and the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
The others include Arthur Bilger, an investment banker at Drexel's Beverly 
Hills office; Leon Black, head of mergers and acquisitions, and John Sorte, 
head of the New York investment banking office. All three were named co-heads 
of corporate finance, filling Bachelor's old position. In addition, Bilger was 
appointed to take Kissick's place as head of West Coast corporate finance. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel on Monday also said that Arthur S. Kirsch, senior vice president and 
head of research, had been named director of the firm's U.S. institutional 
equity operations. A Drexel spokesman said Kirsch would take over the 
responsibilities formerly held by Alan Greditor, who had been the firm's 
managing director in charge of equity trading. Greditor was killed in an 
automobile accident in 1988. SCOT J. PALTROW

 Campeau Corp.'s Federated and Allied department store group said it promoted 
Jeffrey Sherman to be president of the Bloomingdale's division, effective 
immediately. Sherman, 40, formerly executive vice president of the department 
store chain, succeeds Robert Tammero, who was named to a new Federated/Allied 
post of president of regional support services for the Northeast. In that post, 
Tammero will be responsible for improving operating efficiencies for the 
overall company and for helping to oversee Bloomingdale's expansion.

OIL FUTURES TOP $19 A BARREL; REFINERY PROBLEM CITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Crude oil futures climbed Monday, including a late surge as the April contract 
for the benchmark West Texas intermediate grade smashed through two key 
resistance levels and closed above $19 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, copper took a pounding on reports that stocks at the London 
Mercantile Exchange rose rather than declined from the previous week, grain and 
soybean futures posted modest gains on technical buying and spillover strength 
and frozen pork belly futures continued drifting lower as the underlying cash 
market hit nine-year lows. 
</P>
<P>
The energy futures run-up began with reports that operations at Norway's 
fire-damaged Ekofisk complex in the North Sea -- which produces about 250,000 
barrels of oil daily -- would be down for at least another day. 
</P>
<P>
Additional support came when non-OPEC oil-producing nations -- whose share of 
the world market exceeds the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' -- 
announced plans to unilaterally cut an additional 290,000 barrels from their 
daily output. 
</P>
<P>
"Admittedly, those were small bits of news, but there's been strength 
underpinning for the market for a while," said Jim Ritterbusch, vice president 
of trading and research for Chicago-based Carson Petroleum Co. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expects Further Rise 
</P>
<P>
When the April contract topped $18.92, last year's high, it set off one wave of 
technical buying -- a decision based on chart-price comparisons -- and another 
wave followed when the market crashed a second important resistance level at 
$19. 
</P>
<P>
Ritterbusch said he believes that energy futures will continue to rise. 
</P>
<P>
"The last time we got to $19 was almost two months ago, and that was because 
there was a trading squeeze on when the time came for delivery of the February 
contract. This is a little different. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever you set new highs in an up trend," he added, "the line of least 
resistance is to the upside." 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil settled 7 to 53 cents higher on better-than-average volume on the New 
York Mercantile Exchange, with the contract for delivery in April at $19.03 a 
barrel. Heating oil, which also managed contract highs in the nearby months, 
were 0.72 cent to 1.16 cents higher, with April at 52.35 cents a gallon, and 
unleaded gasoline was 0.90 cent to 1.77 cents higher, with April at 53.16 cents 
a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Copper was 3.9 to 5.1 cents lower on the Comex, with March at $1.427 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
The pressure came with news from London Mercantile Exchange officials that 
copper stocks were up 1,775 tons from the previous week, putting total stocks 
at 87,525 tons. 
</P>
<P>
"That's still a relatively low level," said analyst Bette Raptopoulos of 
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York, "but some of the trade were 
looking for a decline. And when no fresh news came along to buoy it up, it just 
kept easing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Technical Buying Cited 
</P>
<P>
The precious metals, except for platinum, were a model of consistency. Platinum 
was $6.80 to $7.60 lower at the New York Merc, with March at $542.40 an ounce. 
At the Comex, gold was 10 cents lower to 10 cents higher, with March at $394.40 
an ounce; silver was 1 cent to 1.8 cent higher, with March at $6.078 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
There was little fresh news in the grain or soybean markets, but technical 
buying led to an upswing in the soybean pits that spilled over into the grains. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the technical buying took place in the May contract, which had traded 
between $7.60 and $7.80 a bushel in recent sessions. It settled 13 cents 
higher, closing at $7.82. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat was 2.50 to 5.50 cents higher at the Chicago Board of Trade, with the 
contract for delivery in March at $4.385 a bushel; corn was 0.75 cent to 1.50 
cents higher, with March at $2.77 a bushel; oats were 2.75 to 3.25 cents 
higher, with March at at $2.0975 a bushel, and soybeans were 7.25 to 13 cents 
higher, with March at $7.685 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
Livestock futures were mixed and pork futures mostly lower at the Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange.

DOLLAR EDGES HIGHER AS DEALERS AWAIT 3 KEY ECONOMIC REPORTS

<TEXT>
<P>
The dollar drifted higher Monday against most key currencies in quiet worldwide 
trading as dealers awaited the release of key economic data. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices were mostly lower. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late 
bid of $393 an ounce, down 50 cents from Friday's late bid. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Holland, a vice president at Discount Corp., said internal market 
influences were largely responsible for the dollar's advance but that most 
dealers were keeping a low profile until economic reports from the United 
States, Britain and Japan were released today. 
</P>
<P>
"The market is a little cautious," he said. 
</P>
<P>
British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson will present the spring 
federal budget to Parliament, the U.S. Commerce Department reports the 
fourth-quarter current account trade balance and Japan releases its latest 
report on wholesale prices. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers said sentiment toward the dollar remained fairly bullish, although 
worries of possible central bank intervention kept trading in a fairly narrow 
range. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
rose 0.69 Japanese yen to 129.57 yen. It was quoted at 129.86 yen in London, 
and later in New York it stood at 130.175 yen, up from 129.40 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar gained against the British pound. It cost $1.7125 to buy one pound 
in London, cheaper than $1.7159 on Friday. In New York, sterling fetched 
$1.71295, down from $1.7177. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to late Friday, included: 1.8675 
West German marks, up from 1.86175; 1.5970 Swiss francs, up from 1.58975; 
1.19815 Canadian dollars, down from 1.19865; 6.32625 French francs, up from 
6.3140, and 1,369.25 Italian lire, up from 1,366.75.

The federal budget, reflecting a continuing favorable economic climate, showed 
a surplus in 1988 for the third straight year, the Finance Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
Federal finances finished $795 million in the black, exceeding the government 
target by $18.5 million, according to ministry estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, federal spending rose 11.6% to $16.9 billion, but revenue rose 12% 
to $17.78 billion, the ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
Regional and local authorities in Switzerland spend much more than the federal 
government, which accounts for only a small part of national spending.

 Satisfied with leasing progress at its 20-story office building under 
construction on the block bounded by B, C, India and Columbia streets, 
developer Cabot, Cabot &amp; Forbes has entered the design competition to 
develop the property northwest of the site. 
</P>
<P>
Cabot, Cabot &amp; Forbes spokesman Gary Toler said the firm will submit a 
design proposal May 1 to the Center City Development Corp., San Diego's 
redevelopment agency, for rights to develop the block bounded by Kettner 
Boulevard, A, B and India streets. Toler said the firm is under contract to buy 
a 20,000-square-foot chunk, or about a third of the block. 
</P>
<P>
He said CC&amp;F's principal competition in obtaining development rights to the 
block is Ohannes Beudjekian, who controls 20,000 square feet of the property. 
Beudjekian was not available for comment Monday. The remaining 10,000 square 
feet of the block is owned by San Diego Trust &amp; Savings as trustee, Toler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The CCDC will make a recommendation to the City Council as to which contestant 
should develop the block based on their designs and qualifications. CC&amp;F 
will propose an 18- to 20-story high-rise of about 350,000 square feet, a 
building roughly the same size as the one under construction. That building, to 
be completed later this year, is 65% leased. 
</P>
<P>
If, after the CCDC makes its recommendation, the competing interests do not 
come to an agreement on disposition of the property, the city could exercise 
its condemnation powers in favor of the recommended party, Toler said.

Business is booming at Loral Conic, a Kearny Mesa manufacturer of telemetry 
transmitters used in missiles and satellites. The subsidiary of New York-based 
Loral Corp. expects a 50% increase in bookings over the previous year for the 
fiscal year ending this month and plans to add 100 employees before Dec. 31, 
bringing payroll up to 500. 
</P>
<P>
Loral Conic, which was founded as Conic in 1961 by five scientists who left 
Cubic Corp. and acquired by Loral Corp. in 1975, declined to specify revenue 
and profit figures. But the company said its bookings, running at a $50-million 
annual rate, are typically delivered over an 18-month to two-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue in 1989 will represent a 12% to 15% increase over 1988, President Joel 
Schindall said last week. The company has no plans to expand its Balboa Avenue 
plant, however. Parent Loral Corp. reported a $74.3-million profit on $1.4 
billion in revenue for fiscal 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Loral Conic's telemetry transmitters enable engineers to track the flight of 
space vehicles. The company also makes data encoders, space transponders and 
"flight termination receivers," or units that scientists use to destroy 
missiles when launches go awry. 
</P>
<P>
Loral Conic customers Ford Aerospace, General Electric, Boeing and Martin 
represent 60% of the company's total business. The company in November received 
an $18-million contract to provide satellite-control equipment to Ford 
Aerospace, the largest contract in Loral Conic's history. 
</P>
<P>
The company has spawned two other divisions since 1961: Loral TerraCom and 
Loral Instrumentation, both based in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The federal Defense Contract Administration recently cited Loral Conic for 
awarding 9% of its subcontracts to small businesses, a share that is 
significantly above the 5% goal of the agency, Schindall said. CHRIS KRAUL

FREE TRAINING MOLDS STUDENTS FOR GROWING FIELD OF COMPOSITE PLASTICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN FAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About a month and a half ago, 18-year-old Alex Carrillo was a self-described 
"hoodlum," a high school dropout who hung around with gang members. Now the 
National City youth says he has a better future to look forward to -- a job 
that is practically guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
Carrillo is one of about a hundred "economically disadvantaged" San Diegans in 
a special training program in composite plastics fabrication, a growing field 
with a severe shortage of entry-level labor. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I heard about this, I wasn't doing too good. I was like a hoodlum," 
Carrillo said. "Now I have a good job to look forward to. Maybe I can go to 
another school after this and maybe, someday, I'll own my own company." 
</P>
<P>
The government-funded training program in Chula Vista, called Comprehensive 
Training Systems (CTS), gives students free instruction on how to make parts 
out of composite materials such as graphite, Kevlar and fiberglass for the 
aerospace and marine industries. Composites, as their name implies, are a blend 
of plastics, metals and synthetic materials increasingly used as basic 
materials in aircraft components. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Low-Income Guidelines 
</P>
<P>
About 130 students graduate from the program each year and go on to jobs with 
starting wages ranging from $5.60 to $8.50 an hour. That's no small amount for 
people who, if single, earned no more than $2,885 in the six months before 
starting the program in order to meet low-income guidelines set by the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Because CTS's $340,000 annual budget is supported by the Private Industry 
Council/Regional Employment and Training Consortium, which administers federal 
Department of Labor funds under the Job Training Partnership Act of 1983, CTS 
must train those who are economically disadvantaged or recently laid off. 
</P>
<P>
Although the dropout rate has been low -- less than 3% during the 2 1/2 years 
CTS has been in operation -- some trainees quit because they cannot afford to 
spend the eight to nine weeks it takes to learn plastics fabrication skills 
without income, according to CTS Executive Director Linda Blair-Forth. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't get any money. They're here because they want to be here. They're 
motivated by employment," said Blair-Forth, who started up the CTS program in 
May, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Carrillo, who turns 19 on March 28, wants to work for Chula Vista-based 
aerospace manufacturer Rohr Industries when he graduates from CTS. An increase 
in commercial aircraft orders in recent months has caused business to boom at 
Rohr, a specialist in making jet engine nacelles, or pods, and other engine 
components. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Best Thing I Could Do,' 
</P>
<P>
"I used to hang around with a lot of gang members, and I got into some fights," 
Carrillo said, sanding a piece of a satellite dish. "What changed me a lot, 
too, was my father passed away, and I had to help my Mom out. This is the best 
thing I could do." 
</P>
<P>
Blair-Forth says the shortage of workers who are experienced in composite 
plastics is aggravated by the fact that composite plastics is a relatively new 
field and few people are aware of it. 
</P>
<P>
"When I put the program together, the (composite plastics) companies were 
actually, literally taking employees" by "poaching" them from other companies, 
she said. "There was a tremendous shortage and this is an up and coming 
profession." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for General Dynamics, who said the company looks at CTS as its 
primary resource pool for all its plastics fabricators, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, there's a high level of competition within the industry for these 
types of people . . . here in the San Diego market we have a number of 
competitors that look to hire these skills. San Diego is also known for its 
fiberglass boat-producing business, and they're also large consumers of people 
skilled in plastic fabrication," said Jerry Williams, manager of employment for 
the company's Convair division. 
</P>
<P>
General Dynamics' Convair Division uses composites to make its two most 
important product lines: the Tomahawk cruise missile for the Navy and the 
fuselage of the MD-11, a commercial wide-bodied plane designed by McDonnell 
Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said it is projected that another 60 plastic fabricators will be hired 
in 6 to 12 months. "Chances of filling (those jobs) are very good with CTS. 
Without CTS . . . we'd have to hire semi-skilled people with very little 
composite experience if any, and we'd have to train them here at our expense." 
</P>
<P>
CTS's curriculum is constantly updated with the help of an advisory board made 
up of representatives from companies such as General Dynamics and McDonnell 
Douglas, the top two defense contractors in the country. Representatives from 
Cape Composites, Composite Optics, Composite Tooling Specialties, Corsair 
Marine, Knight &amp; Carver, Performance Plastics, Teledyne Ryan Aeronautical, 
United Technologies and Vantage Associates -- all companies with San Diego 
operations -- also sit on CTS's Industrial Advisory Board. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tours of Operations 
</P>
<P>
Many of these companies give trainees tours of their operations, donate excess 
material for them to work with and teach them how to interview for positions as 
plastics fabricators. Those companies have also recruited CTS graduates. 
</P>
<P>
Blair-Forth said the placement rate of program graduates is close to 100%. Cade 
Composites, a subsidiary of Milwaukee-based Cade Industries, which had sales of 
$2 million in 1988, has hired 18 CTS graduates over the last year and a half. 
Cade uses fiber-reinforced composites to make aerospace products such as 
generator housings for planes, floor panels for helicopters and parts that are 
used to build missiles. 
</P>
<P>
"They come out of the school and they have a basic training in the composite 
business . . . it saves us time, instead of taking someone off the street and 
training them," said Glen Lawford, manufacturing supervisor for Cade 
Composites. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Smith, lamination department supervisor at Corsair Marine, also emphasized 
an increased use of composites in his industry. "The possibilities are 
expanding daily, as far as uses, different strengths and new techniques. People 
are constantly coming up with a newer or better way of doing it," said Smith, 
whose department helps produce 27-foot, fiberglass sail boats. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely the way of the future . . . the market's there, and, speaking 
for Corsair Marine, a good quality individual is something that doesn't come 
through the door everyday." Corsair, which is situated in Chula Vista, has 
hired about 10 CTS graduates since the program started. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Simulated Environment 
</P>
<P>
CTS, which simulates a work environment complete with time clocks and a 
foreman, does not consider itself a school. "You can be terminated for poor 
attendance or poor behavior," said Blair-Forth. Besides learning basic 
techniques in making the parts, trainees improve their math skills and are 
taught how to read blueprints. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for McDonnell Douglas in Long Beach said the company had hired 40 
to 50 CTS graduates since the job training program started. "From a skill 
orientation level they seem to be doing a good job . . . the people we've hired 
seem to know their skills and seem to be very well motivated," said spokesman 
David Eastman. 
</P>
<P>
Berhane Mengistu, 46 years old, of East San Diego said he applied to CTS 
because he is good with his hands. Cecil Griffin, 33, of San Diego, applied 
because "composite plastics is a new industry, like computers in the '70s. It's 
a ground-floor opportunity into a field that's totally open." 
</P>
<P>
Santee resident Tran Hong Yen, 27, said she doesn't have enough money to go to 
college. "This is free and (I'm) learning something new," she said.

SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite rising interest rates and fears of increased inflation, the market 
continues to move ahead, according to Irving Katz, director of research for 
Thomas Green/San Diego Securities. "Since the first of the year, the market has 
gained about 8% as it continues to defy the pessimistic short sellers and 
traders who have been waiting for a fall," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
Eight San Diego stocks reached new highs this past week. Home Federal Savings 
&amp; Loan, which sells at 80% of tangible book value -- and about six times 
earnings -- received a favorable mention in Barron's magazine. Merrill Lynch 
recently upgraded its estimate of Home Federal's 1989 earnings to $5.45 a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
DH Technology continued to record new highs as it gained $1.125 to $8.75. The 
manufacturer of printer heads is showing improved earnings after digesting an 
acquisition that will double this year's revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey continued to rally on excellent 1988 earnings. The company gained 
$.875 to hit a new 52-week high of $4.875. Humphrey expects 1989 revenue to 
increase by 30% in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Molecular Biosystems reached a new high as it gained $1.375 to $17.625. The 
company signed a $31-million marketing pact with Shionogi &amp; Co. of Japan 
for the development and marketing of its Albunex ultrasound contrast agent. 
</P>
<P>
Rohr Industries made a new high of $37.875 on recurring takeover rumors but 
closed the week up $2.25 to $34.75. 
</P>
<P>
Monitor Technologies reached a new high of $5.875 on no evident news but closed 
the week up $1.125 to $5.375. 
</P>
<P>
Pancretec, which continued to hit new highs on excellent earnings prospects, 
gained $2.125 to $11.75. 
</P>
<P>
Intermark reached a new high Monday -- if one includes the recently announced 
10% stock dividend, Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
Other good gainers this week were Mycogen, up $.50 on news of a $1.8-million 
equity investment by a U. S. subsidiary of Japan Tobacco. The unit would also 
pay Mycogen $7.7 million over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the good news, some San Diego stocks recorded new lows. Sym-Tek 
Systems fell to $6.625 as traders were reluctant to purchase a 20,000-share 
block that became available. After finding a buyer, the stock moved back to $9, 
where it closed down $.50 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
Synbiotics hit a new low of $5 in continued reaction to its poor third-quarter 
earnings. Syntro matched its low of $1 as Upjohn filed a patent infringement 
suit over Syntro's pseudorabies vaccine for swine.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: VOTE SET ON ACQUISITION OF ENCINO INSURANCE FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shareholders are scheduled to vote March 31 on whether to approve the 
acquisition of Republic American Corp., an Encino workers' compensation 
insurance company, by Penn Central Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The merger, which needs the blessing of those owning two-thirds of Republic 
American's shares, is expected to be approved. Both companies are controlled by 
Cincinnati financier Carl H. Lindner. 
</P>
<P>
About 53% of Republic American's stock is already owned either by Penn Central, 
a telecommunications and defense company in Greenwich, Conn., or another 
Lindner-controlled company, American Financial Corp. Penn Central is offering 
$153 million, or $15.75 a share, for the 47% stake that Lindner-controlled 
companies do not already own.

St. Ives Laboratories said its earnings more than tripled to $421,000 in the 
fourth quarter that ended Dec. 31 from a year earlier, although the profit was 
boosted by income from investments and a lower tax rate. Sales climbed 8% in 
the quarter to $22.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Chatsworth maker of hair care products said it earned $4.5 million in 1988, 
up 10% from 1987. Sales increased 18% in the year to $103.9 million.

The Scene: A benefit encore performance of "Laundromatinee" by Collage Dance 
Theatre. Originally performed last December, the dancers again took over the 
Thrifty Wash in Santa Monica to raise money for a matching grant from the 
National/State/County Partnership funding agency. Guests pulled into the strip 
shopping center, left their cars with the valet, picked up a program (folded in 
an empty mini-detergent box) and entered the antiseptic world of Thrifty Wash 
with its harvest gold and tomato red decor. Some mistakenly went to the 
Brite-Wash across the street, only to find people simply doing their laundry. 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz: Those who had never seen "Laundromatinee" before were very pleasantly 
surprised by the dancers' work. "They made such great use of the space!" one 
woman squealed. Another guest gave it higher marks than the American Ballet 
Theatre's current production of "Swan Lake." But then, ABT didn't have the 
added advantage of spin-dry. 
</P>
<P>
Who was there: Dancers Debi Albeyta Cindy Clarke, September Gaw, Eimi Guirao, 
Betsy Howard, Vanessa Vandergriff and artistic director/choreographer Heidi 
Duckler; Tina and Steve Silberman; Richard and Sandy Mallory; Abby Sher; Roland 
Wiley; Susan and Michael Lushing, Eric Rosenfeld; Gil and Shari Escobedo; Greg 
Goyeneche; Hali Paul and Howard Brock and musician Randy Gornel, who six years 
ago did a Las Vegas lounge act/performance art piece at the Thrifty Wash and 
the Brite-Wash. Life, like the wash, works in cycles. 
</P>
<P>
Dress mode: Eclectic. Many tall male and female yuppies zipped over from work 
in their BMWs, dressed in suits and horn-rimmed glasses; one woman opted for 
black gloves with her strapless dress and others wore jeans. 
</P>
<P>
The food: Donated by Trader Joe's, it included Brie, fresh fruit, crackers and 
wine, set on platters atop the washers. One pesticide-conscious woman was 
horrified to find bunches of grapes among the fruit. "They can't serve those 
grapes!" she cried. "People will have mutant babies if they eat those grapes!" 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: "We spent six weeks rehearsing here while people did their laundry," 
Duckler said. "Some people were just really incensed. And we felt bad that the 
owner was losing money so we all brought our wash here." 
</P>
<P>
Triumphs: Overwhelmingly favorable reviews from the audience, who never 
expected to have so much fun and actually be exposed to culture in a 
Laundromat. 
</P>
<P>
Glitches: With no real seats, shorter guests found it difficult to see the 
performance, especially with all those tall yuppies in the way. 
</P>
<P>
Sentimental Journey: Laundromat owner Stan Fox was presented with a collage of 
photos and reviews, signed by the dancers. "When they called and asked if they 
could do the performance here originally, I couldn't say no," he said. "I said 
OK, as long as it doesn't disrupt the business. And it disrupted the business. 
I thought, 'What'd I do this for?' But I got to like 'em so much. And the show 
was a big hit. They worked really hard, trying different things, going in the 
dryers, in the washing machines. I thought that was the last I'd see of them, 
but I was delighted when they called me again. I really missed 'em while they 
were gone." JEANNINE STEIN

IT'S NO ACT WHEN MAITRE D' TALKS ABOUT MOVIES, SHOW BUSINESS

Patrons of La Jolla's tony Marine Room restaurant may not realize it, but their 
maitre d', Dennis Rush, had an acting lesson from James Cagney, kissed Miss 
Universe, cried on Dorothy Malone's shoulder and appeared at the Academy Awards 
-- all before the first grade. 
</P>
<P>
At the age of 5, the now 37-year-old Rush was being featured in his first film, 
"Man of a Thousand Faces," with Cagney, Malone, Jim Backus and Jane Greer. That 
cinematic version of the life of Lon Chaney was the start of a film and 
television career that lasted until hormones and the draft conspired to turn 
his life in another direction. 
</P>
<P>
Rush's career began in storybook fashion during a lunch with his father, Jack, 
a film archivist at the then Universal-International Studios. 
</P>
<P>
"If you were good all week, you got to go have lunch with dad at the studio," 
recalled Rush, during a recent interview. "Well, one week, I got to dress up 
and eat with dad at the commissary. It turns out that Jimmy Cagney was sitting 
at the next table. He had been casting for the part of a 5-year-old to play his 
son without any luck. So he turns to my dad, says he's looking for a kid to 
play his son and says, 'Your son is the spitting image of me at that age.' " 
</P>
<P>
Rush began filming around Christmas in 1956. He required a little coaching. 
</P>
<P>
"I just remember them kneeling down and saying stuff like, 'Now, in a few 
minutes I'm going to say 'Hello' to you. Say 'Hello' back.' " 
</P>
<P>
Not exactly the Method, but it worked. 
</P>
<P>
Technicians tickled his feet to make him laugh, but the real acting lesson came 
on Christmas Eve when Cagney took him for a little walk and helped him get in 
the mood to cry. 
</P>
<P>
"He says, 'You know, this has all been make-believe,' " Rush recalled being 
told that night. " 'But you know how much fun Christmas can be and being with 
your folks and all that? Well, this little boy is never going to see his mom or 
his dad again. No more Christmases. No more good food.' 
</P>
<P>
"He kept that up for a walk around the sound stage and had me in tears. We went 
right in and did the scene in five minutes. Whenever I had to cry from then on, 
I remembered that." 
</P>
<P>
Commercials and television Westerns kept Rush busy for the next several years. 
</P>
<P>
"You talk about fantasy growing up," he said, "I got to play Western with real 
cowboys, real Indians, real guns and real horses." 
</P>
<P>
As a commercial actor, Rush introduced such products as Nestea, Downy fabric 
softener and jif peanut butter. 
</P>
<P>
His career took off and he became one of the busiest 
</P>
<P>
child actors in Hollywood. Rush doesn't link his success to any special acting 
ability, however. 
</P>
<P>
"Directors just remembered the important stuff like, 'Did he show up on time?' 
'Did he have his lines down?' And, 'Was he a total brat?' It was also the face. 
When you'd go in for these things, they always wanted the tall, blond kid, the 
fat kid, and the freckle-faced kid. That was my stereotype and it worked." 
</P>
<P>
With dozens of "Virginians," "Laramies" and "Wagon Trains" under his belt ("I 
died twice in one year on 'Wagon Train,' " he said, laughing), acting became 
nearly a full-time job. He enjoyed it, but there were drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Even when he wasn't working, his social life suffered. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd get home from school at 3, and most days I had to be somewhere at 3:15 for 
an interview. The after-school fun was not there." 
</P>
<P>
But for Rush, the worst part was damage to his budding sports career. 
</P>
<P>
"When the priority was set with my parents, there were a couple of heated 
exchanges with my folks. It was, 'What's more important, a Little League game 
or work? The opportunity to sit in a hall with about 100 other kids and having 
your five minutes saying your name and your credits or going to a Little League 
game?' 'Hey, don't ask me what's more important! I'm 12 years old. I'm too 
young for a job.' " 
</P>
<P>
But he continued to work in what has become classic television: "Kraft 
Television Theater," "Alcoa Premier," "General Electric Theater," "Perry 
Mason," "The Lucy Show" and a host of short-lived series like "Going My Way," 
"Checkmate" and "McKeever &amp; the Colonel." Along the way, he acted with Gene 
Tierney, Mickey Rooney, Gene Kelley and Leo G. Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
He was even directed by the great John Ford in "The Colter Craven Story," a 
special episode of "Wagon Train," and got firsthand experience with Ford's 
renowned temper. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a pretty heated show, and Ward Bond and Ford and some others got pretty 
intense with each other. Everything was 'F' this and 'F' that. The teacher 
walked onto the set and told John Ford that I didn't have to listen to that 
sort of language and that, if he didn't stop, she was going to yank me off the 
set. I just thought, 'What's the big deal? I hear this at home all the time 
from my good Irish father.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ford continued to swear, and Rush was given a private trailer. 
</P>
<P>
There were no such problems with "The Andy Griffith Show." Rush played Howie, 
one of Opey's best friends. He relished every appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"It took a normal show about five days to film. It took 'Andy Griffith' three," 
he recalled. "On lunch breaks, we'd just run to the lunch truck and run back. 
Ronny Howard had a short basketball hoop set up for him, so we got pretty close 
to dunking. Andy and some of the others were pretty good guitar players, so it 
was a regular hootenanny right through lunch." 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Howie role is the one for which he is most remembered by rerun 
connoisseurs. 
</P>
<P>
Rush came to the attention of Disney studios thanks to his role as Horrible 
Horace, the "brat next door" on "My Favorite Martian." His first Disney role 
was in "Kilroy" for "Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color." The four-part 
film was later recut and released theatrically. 
</P>
<P>
By 1966, Rush was a frequent Disney player. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the best you could do as a kid actor," he said. But Disney also 
spelled the end of his career. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd always play parts younger than you, so you'd have that little extra 
maturity and experience," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That led to the improbable sight of Rush driving himself to work in "little-boy 
short pants." But puberty could not be held off forever and, in 1967, when Rush 
returned from a summer hiatus to dub lines for the film "Follow Me Boys," 
nature had taken its course. 
</P>
<P>
"We started dubbing and they go, 'Hey, wait, you're not Jimmy,' " he recalled. 
"I said, 'Yeah, believe me. I'm Dennis Rush. I played Jimmy.' But my voice had 
dropped. I did two more 'Andy Griffiths' and that was it." 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen months later, Rush, whose draft number was 3 ("It was the only lottery 
I ever won"), quickly joined the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so weird. One minute, you're at Walt Disney in total fantasy eating 
popcorn and watching yourself on the screen. The next minute, it's total 
reality and you're on a military transport plane for Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Rush, he was ordered off the plane in Hawaii, where he 
remained, taking casualty reports, for the rest of his hitch. 
</P>
<P>
There was more somber reality waiting when he got back. As a child actor, he 
had earned as much as $500 a week and said he had been told that it had all 
been put away. But, when he came out of the Marines, there was nothing -- "Not 
10 cents," he sighed. 
</P>
<P>
Rush refused to detail the family politics involved. 
</P>
<P>
"It was as ugly as ugly can be," he said. "That's the biggest stinger of this 
whole thing. It was nothing but good times going through it and a real 'Errr' 
(he twists an imaginary knife) at the end to find out, 'Oh? Nothing?' " 
</P>
<P>
He entered the University of San Diego on the GI Bill and bank loans, with an 
eye to becoming a history teacher. While in school, he worked as a bartender at 
Elario's in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
"When I finally got my credential and found out how much teachers made, I 
realized I was making more than that in tips every year." 
</P>
<P>
Now, the restaurant business is his chosen career. He claims to be content with 
an occasional letter from "Andy Griffith" fans and a few residual checks from 
the Screen Actors Guild. He retains his SAG membership but has no pretensions. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll take whatever roles Dustin Hoffman doesn't want," he laughs. "Hollywood 
has done quite well without me." 
</P>
<P>
A 1976 letter from Cagney in response to a Rush get-well note may have 
confirmed his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I had speculated over the years as to just what had become of you," Cagney 
wrote. "Your strong, disciplined writing suggests that you have made your way 
successfully in your chosen field. I am very pleased, of course, that you have 
done just that in as much as I know how precarious the acting business is. It 
was purest wisdom on your part and not for any lack of talent but simple 
economics." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Rush argues, his current job is very similar to being a stage manager. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm directing a play every night with a cast of characters. At 6 o'clock you 
have an audience, and you've got to feed them. In a way, I'm still in The 
Business."

BALLET REVIEW;

<P>
KIROV STARS INVADE ABT 'SWAN LAKE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, Times Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Adore it or deplore it, the new production of "Swan Lake" staged by Mikhail 
Baryshnikov for American Ballet Theatre has a point of view. In fact, it has 
several. 
</P>
<P>
The most striking innovations involve the central ballerina who plays the Swan 
Queen. Like her feathered friends, she favors a long, Romantic tutu. It remains 
stubbornly white, even when in Act III -- this used to be called the black act 
-- it is worn by the innocent heroine's evil alter ego. 
</P>
<P>
Baryshnikov's Odette, moreover, indulges in a reasonable amount of 
story-telling. At key points, she illuminates the dance with elements of mime. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone seeing the production for the first time Sunday night at Shrine 
Auditorium wouldn't have guessed much of this. The heroine on display -- an 
emphatically gorgeous heroine -- turned out to be Altynai Assylmuratova. 
</P>
<P>
At 27, she is the most glamorous, most promising and, in the West, best 
publicized ballerina of the vaunted Kirov Theater in Leningrad. For this 
fleeting guest appearance, she brought along her own style, her own mannerisms, 
her own habits, her own concept, her own traditions and her own white and black 
costumes. 
</P>
<P>
She even brought along her own attentive, accommodating partner, Konstantin 
Zaklinsky. He happens to be her husband. 
</P>
<P>
This, without question, was a star turn. Unfortunately, it was a star turn that 
damaged the integrity of the production. Worse, it was a star turn that 
sometimes faltered even on its own, isolated terms. 
</P>
<P>
Assylmuratova looked stunning, her short circus tutus accentuating her long, 
perfectly proportioned limbs. One had to admire the purity of her line, the 
dramatic arch of her spine, the expressivity of her arms. One had to surrender, 
temporarily at least, to the gaze of her huge, soulful eyes. 
</P>
<P>
She knows all about the legato phrasing of Odette's lyrical passages. She also 
musters the staccato climaxes of Odile (even with no such character identified 
in the program) with elan. 
</P>
<P>
When she danced the same role(s) in the same cavern with the Kirov in 1986, she 
conveyed both the pathos and the glitter of the challenge in muted terms. 
Unlike her Bolshoi cousins, she flirted with noble abstraction rather than 
overt theatricality. It worked. 
</P>
<P>
This time it didn't work so well. In the emphatically foreign, even 
contradictory surroundings, she looked jittery. She delineated a wan swan and a 
gingerly temptress. 
</P>
<P>
She miscalculated some effects. She seemed to disagree with the conductor about 
the tempo of a very slow adagio variation in Act II. She attacked the fouette 
marathon of Act III with lightning bravado that threatened to unwind before the 
climax. 
</P>
<P>
She did project wounded pathos in the finale. This probably was the first time 
she has been asked to execute an unhappy ending in this ballet. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the time, however, she resembled a stranger in the wrong paradise. One 
wondered how much time, effort and energy had been expended in the practical 
art of assimilation. 
</P>
<P>
Zaklinsky partnered her with noble sympathy as Prince Siegfried. Tall, slender 
and easily aristocratic in his Kirov costume, he brooded nicely in the first 
act, telegraphed proper wonder in the second and conveyed ample ardor in the 
third. He didn't even seem disconcerted by the mighty offstage crash -- the 
latest in a silly series of Shrine Auditorium contretemps -- that punctuated 
the Black Swan pas de deux. 
</P>
<P>
With his high cheek bones, muscular torso and flowing locks, he looks a bit 
like the young Nureyev. Unfortunately, he doesn't dance like a young Nureyev. 
His technical skills must be described as modest. 
</P>
<P>
As Benno, the prince's friend, Jeremy Collins projected rough-edged, eager 
virtuosity. Although still listed as a member of the corps, he is scheduled to 
take over the hero's duties on Wednesday. It will be interesting to observe his 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
The swan corps seemed understandably tired in Act II but made much of the 
poignant, willowy formations devised by Baryshnikov for the denouement. The 
excellent corps de ballet was trained, not incidentally, by Susan Jones, who 
was inadvertently denied credit in a previous review. 
</P>
<P>
PierLuigi Samaritani's sets remain problematic. The lake scene is especially 
ungainly and illogical. In Orange County last December the decors at least 
enjoyed the advantages of better lighting and better sight lines. 
</P>
<P>
The resident orchestra played untidily for Jack Everly in an apparently steamy 
pit. Sensibly, the musicians doffed their dark jackets. Although the sartorial 
indulgence must have enhanced their comfort, it created a distracting sea of 
white shirt sleeves in front of the stage.

A poster made by a 14-year-old boy from Beirut has been picked from more than 
100,000 entries as the winner of an international peace poster contest. 
Mustapha Tawoukji received a $500 check and a plaque Monday at the United 
Nations in New York. The competition, organized by Lions Clubs International, 
was on the theme "Peace Will Help Us Grow" and drew entries from more than 49 
countries. Mustapha's winning poster depicts a white dove flying over a rose. 
The young student at the Makased School Alhorj for Boys was accompanied to New 
York by his mother and a sister. He received a standing ovation when he was 
introduced by Lions Club International President Austin P. Jennings, who said 
the organization's first peace poster contest had been won by someone who had 
"never known peace during his lifetime."ALEENE MacMINN

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: CLASSICAL MUSIC / KENNETH HERMAN;

<P>
WEEKEND PROMISES TO BE AN OASIS IN CHORAL DESERT 
</P>

<P>
In spite of sporadic efforts, San Diego is not known as a mecca for choral 
singing. It remains a far cry from cities such as Minneapolis and Washington, 
where many professional and semi-professional choral groups complement 
adventurous church choir programs. This coming weekend, however, promises to be 
an oasis in the local choral desert. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, the touring University of Chicago motet choir visits Clairemont 
Lutheran Church with a Palestrina "Missa Brevis,' as well as shorter works by 
Debussy, Poulenc and Messiaen. Sunday afternoon, the cathedral choir of St. 
Paul's Episcopal Cathedral, directed by choirmaster Edgar Billups, sings the 
Requiem and "Mass for Men's Voices" by contemporary French composer Maurice 
Durufle. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Master Chorale, the area's oldest and most dependable choral 
organization, takes over the downtown First Presbyterian Church Sunday at 8 
p.m. to sing Mozart's "Coronation Mass" and the Faure Requiem. According to 
Master Chorale director Frank Almond, his group is on a roll after January's 
performances with the San Diego Symphony of Beethoven's Ninth (Choral) Symphony 
under the dean of American choral conductors, Robert Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
"Shaw was pleased with the group and was eager to return," said Almond. Almond 
will reciprocate the compliment and spend some of his upcoming sabbatical at 
Emory University working under Shaw, whom he characterized as "the most vital 
72-year-old musician I've ever encountered." 
</P>
<P>
Almond is preparing his choir for a European tour this July, during which they 
will perform both the Faure and Mozart works, as well as American folk hymns 
from the "Sacred Harp" and "Creation," an early composition by San Diego 
composer David Ward-Steinman. 
</P>
<P>
"Since we will be singing primarily in Catholic churches, they now require all 
the repertory to be sacred," said Almond. Performances in cathedrals in Vienna 
and Salzburg will be highlights of the summer tour. 
</P>
<P>
The Master Chorale's programs with the symphony this season have turned out to 
be a box-office blessing for the San Diego Symphony. After a two-year hiatus 
that started with the canceled 1986-87 orchestra season, the two musical 
organizations resumed working relations last December with the cooperation they 
enjoyed during the heyday of former orchestra music director David Atherton. 
The only symphony subscription concerts that have sold out thus far this season 
have been four "Messiah" and Beethoven's Ninth programs, all joint performances 
with the Master Chorale. Although the symphony's 1989-90 season has yet to be 
announced, we can expect more collaboration between these organizations. 
</P>

WAITING IN THE WINGS. Tenor Elliot Palay is not eager to get a reputation for 
indolence, but he is being paid by Los Angeles Music Center Opera to sit around 
and do nothing. In truth, Palay, a member of the United States International 
University faculty, is covering for tenor Placido Domingo in Verdi's "Otello," 
which opens later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever Domingo is performing "Otello," Palay is required to be within 20 
minutes of the theater. 
</P>
<P>
"In Los Angeles and New York, that means somewhere inside the building, not 
across the next freeway. Usually, I sit in the audience and let them know where 
I am," explained Palay. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for the 40-year-old Heldentenor, his job is not entirely a waiting 
game. During rehearsals last week and this week, while the company awaits 
Domingo's return, Palay has been taking the superstar's place. 
</P>
<P>
Although Palay has not had much of a vocal career in this country, he sings 
extensively in Europe. The summer before last, he sang in the Danish National 
Opera's "Ring" cycle, and this May he will repeat two of his Wagnerian heroes 
in Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
Palay hit pay dirt several years ago while covering for the tenor lead in 
Wagner's "Tristan und Isolde." The slated tenor took ill at noon, and Palay 
made his debut Tristan four hours later. 
</P>
<P>
RETURN OF THE NATIVE. Pianist Gregory Allen returns to Civic Theatre tonight to 
play a solo recital for the San Diego Community Concert Assn. To be correct, 
Allen, who was born in Cheyenne, Wyo., cannot be claimed as a San Diego native. 
He did grow up here, however, and his influential early piano teacher was San 
Diegan Florence Stephenson. While he went on to win many awards, including the 
grand prize of the 1980 Arthur Rubinstein International Piano Competition, his 
first competition laurel was a San Diego Musical Merit Foundation scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
Allen is on the music faculty of the University of Texas at Austin. Since 1987, 
the centennial year of Rubinstein's birth, Allen has embarked on a project to 
record all the 20th-Century works written for and dedicated to Rubinstein.

"Today" co-anchor Bryant Gumbel and weatherman Willard Scott were in the same 
studio Monday for the first time since the leak two weeks ago of Gumbel's 
private memo that criticized Scott and others on the NBC show. No mention was 
made of the much-publicized memo. The high-spirited Scott kissed Gumbel on the 
cheek, then jovially needled him while talking about the different kinds of 
animal foods made by the Purina company. "They make it for the complete horse, 
so you wouldn't be interested," Scott said. Gumbel appeared somewhat 
nonplussed. "I had to do something," the weatherman explained, laughing. Scott, 
on vacation last week, had been scheduled to do his part of Monday's show from 
Washington. But "Today" executives decided to bring him to New York 
instead.ALEENE MacMINN

REDISCOVERY OF JESUIT-GUARANI INDIAN WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINE McKENNA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When a Catholic school presents a show of religious art, one doesn't expect 
revisionist history to be written. And not surprisingly "Paradise Lost" (on 
view at Loyola Marymount's Laband Art Gallery through Saturday) is presented as 
living testimony to the auspicious legacy of the Jesuits. The survey is of art 
made in South America during the 17th and 18th centuries by Guarani Indians 
under the tutelage of Jesuit missionaries. 
</P>
<P>
Those who caught Roland Joffe's 1987 film "The Mission" should have a passing 
familiarity with the Guarani, who were first colonized by the Jesuits, then 
enslaved by the Spanish. Your basic Christianity-versus-paganism epic, the 
story of the Guarani is in some respects more interesting than the art in 
"Paradise Lost," which looks for the most part like standard-issue sacred art 
of the Baroque period. The sweeping Baroque style promoted by the European 
Jesuits was broad enough to assimilate -- and upstage -- regional idioms, and 
it is the dominant voice we hear in this art. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is accompanied by an exhaustingly thorough catalogue that is 
fascinating and troubling. Including six essays by various scholars, the text 
is riddled with such comments as, "in the history of the Conquest there was 
nothing more beautiful than the image of the Jesuit, his prayer book under one 
arm and no other aim but to bring these primitive people to the bosom of Mother 
Church." Nowhere is it suggested that the Jesuits may have been a bit bossy, 
misguided even, in their missionary zeal. 
</P>
<P>
And zealous they were. No one can question the devotion of these men who 
succeeded in colonizing 100,000 Guarani from 1609 to 1767. Before the arrival 
of the Jesuits (who traveled to South America from all over Europe), the 
Guarani lived throughout Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay. The Jesuits rounded 
them up and settled them in 30 communities known as Reductions (a synonym for 
"a place of teaching"). Text posted in the exhibition informs us that "it was 
thought the Guarani couldn't be human, much less Christian, if they were 
dispersed through forest and field without any political organization." 
</P>
<P>
Often cited as models of colonization, the Reductions created dictionaries 
preserving the Guarani language, protected the Indians from slavery (Spanish 
soldiers bent on conquest were lurking about South America at the time), 
introduced them to astronomy and sewage systems, enforced a strict separation 
of the sexes and taught them how to make art. European art. While the catalogue 
states that the Jesuits "were liberal in permitting local traditions to 
survive," you really have to look for the regional stamp on this work. 
</P>
<P>
Only 1% of the works created in the Reductions has survived two centuries of 
Paraguayan political upheaval and religious reformation, so these pieces are 
exceedingly rare and of high quality. Drawn from private collections, none of 
the works are signed or dated. In fact, historians have been unable to discern 
whether a given work was made by a Jesuit or a Guarani. It is known, however, 
that all the artists were men who toiled in workshops located near the Father's 
quarters -- "in order to facilitate the Father's necessary continuous 
vigilance," the catalogue explains. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, Jesus Christ is the star of "Paradise Lost." For centuries the 
repository of the deepest longings and fears of the human race, the Christ 
figure is depicted here as we've seen him countless times before: on the cross; 
with his Virgin Mother; ascending to heaven. 
</P>
<P>
Executed for the most part in polychromed wood, the works occasionally reveal 
discreet traces of the Guarani's native voice. Faces on a few figures, for 
example, are broad, flat and recognizably Indian. Embellishment and trim on 
architectural fragments look vaguely Aztec, and a few oddball works look more 
folk than Baroque. A sculpture of Christ at the pillar has a crude, schematic 
simplicity typical of folk art, while two small sculptures of Jesus seated in a 
chair passing time in a manner reminiscent of Rodin's "Thinker" have an 
engaging playfulness rare in religious art. It's impossible to know, however, 
whether these comparatively awkward pieces represent a respected style, or are 
simply the work of an unskilled apprentice. 
</P>
<P>
While some viewers may take issue with the ideology behind the Reductions and 
the art it produced, this is nonetheless a beautifully executed show. Installed 
with lush tropical orchids, traditional Guarani music, explanatory text and 
photographs of missionary ruins, it succeeds in conveying a sense of the mood 
of the world that produced these pieces.

YUSEF LATEEF WORK PREMIERED AT CALARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. JAMES LISKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite his antipathy toward jazz, saxophonist-composer Yusef Lateef, in the 
course of his world premiere presentation Sunday night at CalArts in Valencia, 
offered ample proof that the music does, in fact, provide the very basis of his 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, "Double Concerto," composed with percussionist Adam Rudolph, was not 
by any stretch of the imagination a jazz piece, but at its heart and soul were 
the world-music elements that have contributed to the creation of jazz. 
</P>
<P>
The piece, the final offering of CalArts' 13th Contemporary Music Festival, was 
an ambitious composition that borrowed heavily from a multitude of African 
traditions while maintaining a reliance on improvisation. At the fore of the 
improvised sessions was Lateef, playing mostly tenor saxophone but providing 
scintillating work on the flute and a handful of African folk instruments. 
</P>
<P>
And try as he mightn't, the piece swung from beginning to end. 
</P>
<P>
Lateef and Rudolph, the latter a much-heralded player, scholar and faculty 
member of CalArts, wrote the piece for a chamber group of 17 players. The 
instrumentation was not constant throughout the piece, but variously featured 
such an array of instruments so odd that the bassoon seemed a rather mundane 
inclusion. Nevertheless, the craftsmanlike combination of saxophones and ewe 
drums, guitars and pakhawaj, synthesizer and kendang was both appealing and 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
Not so effective was the structure of "Double Concerto." Borrowing from the 
classical definition of the term, the piece was in three distinct sections. But 
there was little thematic material to tie the three movements together and each 
movement was further subdivided into multiple other sections. What resulted, to 
a certain degree, was a cut-and-paste job that could have benefited from better 
transitions. 
</P>
<P>
This vignette approach did, however, highlight and make more distinct the 
musical ideas of the composers. It was almost as if each idea in the hourlong 
composition was deserving of, if not begging for, further exploration and 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Lateef and Rudolph's debut was an auspicious one nonetheless. With time and the 
global community's growing acceptance and acknowledgement of composers from the 
jazz idiom, they might be afforded the opportunities to write pieces that don't 
have to live as compendiums of a musical heritage.

'GREAT ARRANGERS': A SPELLBINDING MATINEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The great outdoor jazz concert season has begun, and it could hardly have 
started more stylishly than with the triple-threat attraction offered Sunday 
afternoon by KLON at the John Anson Ford Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"Jazz West Coast: The Great Arrangers" was the apt title. Three big bands were 
led by Shorty Rogers, Gerald Wilson and Bill Holman, whose writing, coupled 
with a full measure of spirited solos, determined the success of this 
often-spellbinding matinee. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers was the most traditional, using several charts he wrote for sessions in 
the 1940s or '50s. Some were derivative but pleasant in a Basie vein; others, 
possibly more recent, reflected an innovative orchestral approach. 
</P>
<P>
The brass section included two valve trombonists: Mike Fahn was at his voluble 
best in "I'm Gonna Go Fishin' " and Bob Enevoldsen was well-framed in the 
richly textured "Contours." 
</P>
<P>
"Lanny Morgan," a mini-suite for saxophone, came alive via shifts of tempo, 
meter and mood, with Morgan's alto in rare form. The Coopers, Bob on tenor and 
Buster on trombone, also brought substance to the set, which ended with a 
glittering sublimation of Bud Powell's "Un Poco Loco." 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Wilson moved from his standard blues opener to a series of originals, of 
which the Mexican-flavored "Carlos" was most typical of his unique scoring. 
"Pisces" found pianist Milcho Leviev in frantic form as he plowed excitingly 
through its shifting rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson brought on a long-ago sideman, trumpeter Carmell Jones (now residing in 
Kansas City) as a guest soloist, reviving such early band pieces as "Blues for 
Yna Yna" and "Viva Tirado." Jones has lost none of his lyrical identity. Ron 
Barrows on trumpet, Louis Bonilla on trombone and Scott Mayo on alto helped 
establish the Wilson imprimatur. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Holman's set displayed his arranging skill along with a sense of humor 
that informs such charts as his "Moon of Mannakoora" parody; the Monk tune "I 
Mean You," given over mainly to three soprano saxes; and the witty "Just 
Friends," in which a dozen horns play several choruses entirely in unison, in 
the style of an ad lib solo. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Cooper broke it up with his masterful tenor sax on "Rhythm-A-Ning." The 
Mingus composition "Goodby Pork Pie Hat" was plaintively scored, using 
everything from piccolo and bass clarinet to muted brass. 
</P>
<P>
The next concert in KLON's series will be "A Celebration of Stan Kenton," with 
an alumni band, April 2 at the Ford Theatre.

BALLET REVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
BROWNE AND BUSTAMANTE IN 'SWAN LAKE' MATINEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's a unique chemistry to nearly any American Ballet Theatre performance in 
which Leslie Browne dances with Ricardo Bustamante. Whether the ballet is 
dramatic (Tudor's "Pillar of Fire") or abstract (Tippet's "Bruch Violin 
Concerto"), something beyond skillful execution occurs: something unmistakably 
elemental. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday afternoon, Browne and Bustamante assumed the leading roles in the 
company's new "Swan Lake" and their rapport again proved extraordinary. His 
remarkable calm and reliability as a partner seemed to free her to be daringly 
spontaneous. In return, her passion appeared to call from him a deep, 
instinctual response. (Can there be a more sweetly protective Siegfried in the 
White Swan pas de deux?) 
</P>
<P>
Browne's emotionalism sometimes verged on the neurotic -- especially in the 
ballroom adagio, where her hot, willful characterization clashed with the 
music. She proved more artful as Odette, emphasizing hopeless suffering and an 
intense but steady flow of movement. The solo seemed to perplex her but 
otherwise she managed to motivate and energize all of the role without 
distorting its formal beauty. Not a majestic Swan Queen, perhaps, but a highly 
individual and convincing one. 
</P>
<P>
From his princely bearing to his nobly phrased, effortlessly produced solos, 
Bustamante made an ideal Siegfried. Occasionally, arm positions looked rushed 
or perfunctory, but this was clearly a performance conceived in the grandest 
danseur noble tradition. 
</P>
<P>
The matinee cast also offered the brasher bravura of Danilo Radojevic (Benno), 
Gil Boggs and John Gardner (Neapolitan Dance), along with the informed 
conducting of Emil De Cou. LEWIS SEGAL

MOTORCYCLIST BADLY HURT IN COLLISION WITH CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 26-year-old motorcyclist was severely injured early Monday when he was struck 
by a car that apparently failed to stop for a red light, a spokesman for the 
California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard H. Williams of Laguna Hills was struck by a car driven by Mercedes 
Muros, 27, of Laguna Hills as he turned left at Paseo de Valencia and Los 
Alisos Boulevard, CHP Officer Drew Hertsch said. The accident occurred about 
7:45 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who was wearing a helmet, suffered a broken left arm and leg and 
other trauma. He was taken to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in 
Mission Viejo, where he was in surgery late Monday, a hospital spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Muros, who complained of head, neck and hip pains, was taken to Saddleback 
Community Hospital in Laguna Hills, where she was treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic citations are pending against both drivers, Hertsch said: against Muros 
for allegedly failing to stop for a red light, and against Williams for 
allegedly not carrying a driver's license and having no proof of vehicle 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Recommendations for citations are routinely submitted to the county district 
attorney's office during investigations of traffic accidents, a CHP spokesman 
said.

SPRINTER SAYS SHE HAD U.S. DRUG SOURCES; 
</P>
<P>
ISSAJENKO CLAIMS SUPPLY CAME FROM SAN GABRIEL DOCTOR, SHOTPUTTER OLDFIELD

<P>
Reading excerpts from a diary that she kept throughout her track career, 
Canadian sprinter Angella Taylor Issajenko provided even more detail Monday 
than her coach, Charlie Francis, had in previous testimony about her extensive 
use of anabolic steroids and other banned substances. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who provided her with performance-enhancing drugs were two 
Americans, shotputter Brian Oldfield of San Jose and Dr. Robert Kerr of San 
Gabriel, she told the Canadian government's commission of inquiry into drug use 
by athletes on the ninth day of testimony concerning track and field. 
</P>
<P>
Issajenko, the first athlete on the witness stand after eight days of testimony 
by Francis, said that she was given steroids on two occasions in 1981 by 
Oldfield and that she received prescriptions for human growth hormone and 
steroids in 1983 from Kerr. 
</P>
<P>
Except for Ben Johnson, world record-holder in the 100 meters, Issajenko, 30, 
is the most prominent of the 13 members of Francis' club who, he testified, 
were using steroids. Steroids are banned by the International Olympic Committee 
and the International Amateur Athletic Federation, which governs track and 
field. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Jamaica but a Toronto resident since 1975, Issajenko holds the Canadian 
record in the 100 and the 200, won a silver medal in the 1984 Los Angeles 
Olympics in the 400-meter relay and twice was ranked fourth in the world in the 
100. 
</P>
<P>
Although she was tested for drugs on several occasions after meets, she never 
tested positive. But she promised that she would be candid with the commission, 
telling the Toronto Sun late last year that her testimony would be "like a 
nuclear bomb exploding." After the explosion caused by Francis' revelations, 
however, her recollections Monday seemed to be just more fallout. 
</P>
<P>
She is expected to continue her testimony today. 
</P>
<P>
Issajenko corroborated Francis' testimony that she began using steroids in 
1979, two years before any other members of his club. But he either was not 
aware of or did not tell the truth about the large dosages that she was taking 
and the potentially harmful side effects that she felt. 
</P>
<P>
Although he seemed to endorse the use of steroids in small dosages and under a 
doctor's supervision, she apparently was not so cautious, experimenting with a 
myriad of drugs in varying dosages, and suffered for it, developing 
hypoglycemia, low blood sugar. 
</P>
<P>
As testified to earlier by Francis, Issajenko was motivated to begin using 
steroids in 1979 because she felt her competition had an edge that she could 
not overcome naturally. 
</P>
<P>
With a reputation for diligence in training -- she scolded herself in her diary 
because she took off one Christmas Eve -- she said that Francis told her that 
she would be able to recover from workouts quicker, enabling her to work even 
harder, if she were on a steroid program. 
</P>
<P>
She said that she began to listen after her first trip in 1979 to East Germany, 
where she competed against Marlies Gohr, former world record-holder in the 100, 
and Marita Koch, former world record-holder in the 200. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to be like them," she said. "I wanted to run as fast as them." 
</P>
<P>
She said that she was further convinced after the 1979 World Cup in Montreal, 
where she finished fifth in the 100 and the 200. 
</P>
<P>
"That was great, considering it was my first full year of track and field 
(after high school)," she said. "But I was written up in the newspapers as a 
disappointment. They expected me to beat Evelyn Ashford and Marlies Gohr. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided that being the Canadian champion wasn't enough. It didn't mean 
anything. I had to go out there and beat the world. I thought that if I went on 
an anabolic program, that would give me the edge that I needed." 
</P>
<P>
An unidentified Toronto doctor prescribed an oral steroid, Dianabol, for her in 
October, 1979, she said. But after the pharmaceutical company quit 
manufacturing it, she said that her supply was virtually exhausted when she 
arrived in Furth, West Germany, in May of 1981 for a meet. 
</P>
<P>
According to her diary, Oldfield gave her another oral anabolic steroid, 
Anavar, to supplement her Dianabol on May 31. Oldfield was the first man to put 
the shot over 75 feet, but it was not accepted as a world record because he did 
it while competing as a professional. 
</P>
<P>
"It was assumed that the throwers were on steroids," Issajenko said. "Charlie 
and I went to him, and he had Anavar and some injectables." 
</P>
<P>
Five days later, still in Furth, she said that Oldfield injected her with 150 
milligrams of a mixture of two extra-strength steroids, Primabolin and 
Decadurabolin, and a naturally-produced male hormone, testosterone. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to blame it all on him," she said. "I asked for it. He had it. He 
gave it to me." 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview from San Jose, Oldfield, 43, denied any knowledge of 
Issajenko or the subject of steroids. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea what she's talking about," he said. "I don't know anyone named 
Chenko. I can't believe this." 
</P>
<P>
Told the specific drugs that Issajenko named, Oldfield said: "The terms you're 
using are news to me. I never used steroids. I didn't need to. I had large 
parents." 
</P>
<P>
Later in the summer of 1981, Issajenko said, she also received a testosterone 
injection from a Canadian shotputter, Bishop Dolegiewicz, whom Francis has 
named as an occasional supplier of drugs to his athletes. Dolegiewicz, who 
coaches in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, has been instructed by his attorney not to 
comment until after the former shotputter testifies before the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Issajenko said that she wrote to Kerr and asked for an appointment in 
September, 1983, after reading about him in a Toronto newspaper. He sent her a 
copy of his book, "The Practical Use of Anabolic Steroids With Athletes," and 
confirmed her appointment for Oct. 11. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd written this book, and he seemed to be the big steroid guru in America," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Entered into evidence was a letter given to her upon her arrival at Kerr's San 
Gabriel office by his secretary. It listed numerous potential side effects of 
steroid use, including liver toxicity and kidney pathology, and advised her to 
contact the doctor if she noticed any of them. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have pondered the above warnings and still feel that, dangerous side 
effects aside, the use of these medicines will enhance your needs, then sign 
and have witnessed this statement," the letter read. "If unsure, then don't 
take any medicine of which you are unsure!" 
</P>
<P>
Issajenko said that she signed the letter but did not read it because she 
already was aware of potential side effects from other literature. 
</P>
<P>
She said that Kerr prescribed human growth hormone, a naturally produced 
substance from human pituitary glands that was extracted from cadavers, and a 
steroid, Anavar, took her blood pressure and performed a blood test. 
</P>
<P>
Kerr, 53, was not available for comment Monday. Asked earlier this month by The 
Times if he had treated Issajenko, Kerr said, "I can't talk about that. It's 
privileged." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "I really don't even remember seeing her. I don't remember the 
situation at all." 
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that he has been asked to testify before the commission in 
mid-April, but he said that Issajenko's treatment will not be the primary topic 
of his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Eight days after she returned from California, Issajenko said, she asked a 
Toronto physician, Dr. Jamie Astaphan, who now lives on the Caribbean island of 
St. Kitts, to monitor her health but that she continued at least temporarily to 
rely on Kerr's advice concerning her drug program. 
</P>
<P>
When she began to suffer from hypoglycemia in February, 1984, she said that 
Kerr advised her that if she insisted on continuing her use of human growth 
hormone, she should take small dosages over a short period of time and consult 
a doctor. She said that she had no further contact with Kerr. 
</P>
<P>
Hypoglycemia was the most serious of the side effects caused by 
performance-enhancing substances, she said. But she testified that she believed 
injuries to her hamstrings and tendons through the years resulted from her use 
of steroids and testosterone too soon before competitions and that she also 
noticed personality changes, including aggressive behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Francis had testified previously that he was not aware of any side effects 
suffered by Issajenko, but said that he believed she was using drugs in small 
dosages. On the contrary, she said that she sometimes took drugs in dosages 
that would better have suited power lifters. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are the mistakes one makes," she said.

A LEADING MAN;

<P>
ANGELS SIGNED WASHINGTON FOR MORE THAN HIS PLAYING ABILITY

Seventeen years ago, a scout for the Oakland Athletics talked A's owner Charlie 
Finley into taking a chance on a 19-year-old outfielder he had been watching 
play on the sandlots of Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
Seven uniforms -- and a tumultuous ride through the big leagues -- later, 
Claudell Washington is in the Angels' spring training complex. 
</P>
<P>
"The man's got a great body for a guy who's 35," Chili Davis says, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
"Thirty-four, man, 34," Washington says. "Don't age me." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the man has a physique that a lot of the 1980s spa generation would 
envy, but the hint of gray in his mustache is an indication that Washington has 
seen a lot, and been through a lot, in almost two decades of professional 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
He never played on the high school level, but his major league career started 
on a high as the fightin' and feudin' A's beat the Dodgers in the 1974 World 
Series. Rookie Washington had four hits in seven at-bats during the series. 
</P>
<P>
Three years later, he was traded to the Texas Rangers, then the Chicago White 
Sox and then the New York Mets until another infamous owner, Atlanta's Ted 
Turner, made free-agent Washington one of the game's wealthiest players with a 
$3.5-million, five-year contract in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Washington hit an all-time low after the 1983 season, and it had nothing to do 
with his batting average. He admitted himself to a Northern California drug 
rehabilitation center for 28 days because of a cocaine dependency. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, Washington was arrested in Walnut Creek, Calif., after about a 
quarter-gram of what was alleged to be cocaine and about five grams of what was 
alleged to be marijuana were discovered in his car when he was stopped for a 
traffic violation. 
</P>
<P>
Washington maintains that the drugs were left by someone who had borrowed his 
car. The cocaine charge eventually was dropped, and Washington entered a 
drug-diversion program to have the marijuana charge dropped from his record. 
But Commissioner Peter Ueberroth still issued a conditional 60-day suspension 
that included a fine, community service work and random drug tests. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, Atlanta traded Washington to the Yankees in mid-season. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Washington had his best season with the Yankees, batting .308 with 
11 homers and 64 runs batted in while batting just 455 times, but the free 
agent's contract negotiations with New York broke down during the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
Finley still takes credit for "discovering" Washington, but you can thank 
George Steinbrenner for allowing him to end up in the Angels' outfield. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the thing with the Yankees would have been resolved," Washington 
said. "But every time we went to negotiate, something new would come up. George 
was doing this and that. 
</P>
<P>
"We asked for three years, but the Yankees wouldn't do it. George said, 'If you 
can get three years somewhere else, then you have my blessing.' So, boom! 
Twenty four hours later I was an Angel. 
</P>
<P>
"George was playing a cat-and-mouse game with us and this time, the mouse 
caught the cat." 
</P>
<P>
The mouse also got a $2.625-million, three-year contract from the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
During the off-season, Davis -- whose agent, Tom Reich, also represents 
Washington -- went to Angel General Manager Mike Port with a suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd played against Claudell in the National League when he was with Atlanta 
and I always liked the way he stays in shape and plays hard," Davis said. "He 
really seems to enjoy the game and I thought he would fit right in on this 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got good speed, he's a good clutch hitter and he battles at the plate. I 
think New York's going to miss him. He wasn't asking for the house, he just 
wanted a piece of furniture so he could feel comfortable in the house. Mike 
Port gave him some security with the three-year deal and made him feel wanted." 
</P>
<P>
It has been suggested that the Angels parted with a lot of money and locked 
themselves into a lot of years with a 34-year-old outfielder, but the Angels 
were looking for more than a player. They wanted an inspirational leader. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's track record -- not to mention his police record -- may not make 
him a prime candidate, but the Angel brass sounds as if they're about to 
nominate him for man of the year, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"First, Claudell did hit .300 in the American League last year and he played 
center field in (spacious) Yankee Stadium," Port said. "But we wanted him for 
his less tangible skills as well. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been pointed out on numerous occasions that this team has been lacking in 
leadership. Well, Washington is a veteran and an excellent man. I see a great 
many similarities between Claudell Washington and (Manager) Doug Rader. Here 
are two guys who have been smart enough to make course corrections in their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
"As I have come to know Claudell in a short time, I'd be hard-pressed to point 
to anyone more solid as a player and an individual." 
</P>
<P>
Rader, who has spent much of the spring telling reporters how his first stint 
as a manager with Texas was a nightmare of his own doing, was quick to offer 
his testimony on Washington's worth, on the field and in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"I was real, real happy initially because of Claudell's reputation as a 
player," Rader said. "But the greatest joy for me has been Claudell as a 
person. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, he's had his problems and that's what makes it even more special. He's a 
good man. He's something special. Whatever it cost us, it was money well 
spent." 
</P>
<P>
Washington has already been an exemplary leader for the Angels. He has been 
working hard this spring, taking extra batting practice and working with 
special running instructor Kevin McNair. Rader insists that Washington is 
trying to improve, not just impress his younger teammates with his work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been spontaneous, not premeditated," Rader said. "It's all legit. He's 
doing it because he wants to get better. That's why he's such a solid guy." 
</P>
<P>
Washington won't talk about his past problems or his abilities as a leader. 
After three seasons of Yankee turmoil, he's just enjoying the tranquility of a 
spring at Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"There's definitely less pressure here," he said. "It's so much more low key. 
You can go about your work and get done what you need to get done. With the 
Yankees, there's always something going on in the papers and in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if you don't read the papers, there's always a reporter coming up and 
telling you what's been in the papers. In the last two years, there was a lot 
of distractions that really wear a team down." 
</P>
<P>
Washington didn't expect to escape the madness in New York and admits he wasn't 
sure he wanted to leave. He liked the idea of playing in a lineup that includes 
"five or six potential Hall of Famers." But he's glad to be on the West Coast, 
closer to his family and Bay Area home. 
</P>
<P>
And he says he thinks the Angels have just as good a chance of getting him 
another World Series ring as the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question about the talent on this team," Washington said. "It's 
just a question of getting the ship sailing in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
That, of course, is one of the main reasons Port and Co. wanted Washington on 
board. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Bert Blyleven got off to a shaky start Monday at Hi Corbett Field at Tucson, 
allowing three runs and four hits in the first inning. But he settled down and 
yielded one run and four hits over the next three innings as Cleveland beat the 
Angels, 5-3. "Bert was so-so but every inning he pitched, he had better 
command," Manager Doug Rader said. "At least he was getting better instead of 
going downhill." . . . The Angels, who had 14 hits in Sunday's 10-8 victory 
over Seattle, had nine Monday. "We have a number of guys who are right on the 
money with the bat," Rader said. "I'm very pleased with the way we've been 
hitting and catching the ball. And overall, the pitching has been pretty good."

JIM MURRAY: RUNNING INTO WALLS HASN'T STOPPED HIM

<P>
If there's one thing Mickey (Himself) Hatcher could always do, it was hit a 
baseball. Hard. Somewhere. Often. 
</P>
<P>
He isn't all that good throwing it, catching it. But give him a bat and he is a 
star. 
</P>
<P>
The other thing he can do is smile. If you walk into a locker room, the one 
with the big grin is Mickey. His attitude is infectious. One of the most dour 
creatures in the world is the ballplayer who has just gone zero for four or 
been knocked out of the box in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey just lets it roll off his back. He has always managed to look as if he 
has just hit the game-winning home run. 
</P>
<P>
Last October, he did. Twice. 
</P>
<P>
The home run everyone remembers -- and always will remember -- from the 1988 
season is the one Kirk Gibson hit with two out in the ninth inning of Game 1. 
It's one of the most famous home runs in baseball history. It won the game, 
maybe the Series. 
</P>
<P>
But Kirk Gibson might not even have been to bat if Mickey Hatcher hadn't hit a 
less famous but equally effective home run in the first inning of that game. 
The Dodgers would never have been in position to pull that game -- and series 
-- out of the fire in the ninth if Mickey Hatcher hadn't hit a two-run homer in 
the first. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson is supposed to hit home runs. He was hitting his 28th home run of 
the season. Hatcher was hitting his second. 
</P>
<P>
In Game 5, Hatcher did it again -- walloping another two-run homer in the 
first. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't the first time a pitching staff had underestimated this Mick who 
wasn't Mantle. 
</P>
<P>
This Mickey manages to look in the batter's box like a little kid playing 
stickball in the streets. He stands in there with this lopsided grin, his 
stockings kind of sag. So does he. The cap is at a rakish angle. He looks a 
little bit like Bugs Bunny at the plate. All he needs is the carrot. 
</P>
<P>
When most people hit home runs, they go around the bases like a Pope. It's not 
even a trot, it's a procession. They stop and bow. Wave their caps. Jeffrey 
Leonard goes around the bases like Cleopatra's barge. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Hatcher goes around as if a posse is after him. He and Pete Rose hold 
the listed world records for circling the bases on home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Hatcher is a throwback to the days when baseball was a game, not a business. He 
is actually a very considerable athlete -- he was a wide receiver for Barry 
Switzer's University of Oklahoma football team, for example. He has pretty good 
speed. He can hit anything that doesn't hit him first. Mickey doesn't require 
of a pitch that it be a strike. Just in the air, is all he wants. 
</P>
<P>
He is a born hitter. Every time you see in a record book where Mickey Hatcher 
has played in 100 games or more a season, you can make book he has hit .300 or 
close to it. If you throw the ball outside, he hits it into right field. If you 
throw it inside, as the Oakland Athletics pitchers found, he hits it in the 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
His problem has always been getting in a lineup. He came up with the Dodgers as 
a third baseman in the days when the team already had one -- Ron Cey. Hatcher 
batted .371, hit 10 homers and drove in 93 runs in his only real full season 
with the minor league Albuquerque Dukes. 
</P>
<P>
On the Dodgers, he just became Ron Cey's caddie -- or Dusty Baker's. The guy 
who goes in for the late innings to give the regular a rest. He got in only 33 
games one year and 57 another. The year he played in 57, he got only 84 
at-bats. He wasn't even a utility man. He was an irregular. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey remained cheerful. Many another player would have tossed helmets, busted 
up lockers, roared, "Play me or trade me!" Mickey just filled in the time 
playing practical jokes. When someone put lampblack on Kirk Gibson's cap last 
year, nobody on the club suspected the real culprit, Jesse Orosco. Everybody 
would have bet on Hatcher as the jokester. 
</P>
<P>
Hatcher figures his horseplay is just a way of cutting tension. 
</P>
<P>
"I just try to keep everybody in a good frame of mind," he says. "When I see a 
guy who has just struck out sitting in a corner of the dugout all by himself, 
biting his lip, I just try to get him so he isn't down on himself. I mean, Babe 
Ruth struck out, right?" 
</P>
<P>
Babe Ruth might have struck out but Mickey Hatcher doesn't very often -- only 
seven times all last year. He usually strikes out only every other eclipse of 
the moon. 
</P>
<P>
So, why did he never become a star? 
</P>
<P>
Hatcher says it's because he always played too hard. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I got a chance to play, I hit a wall," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
He got carried out of Fenway Park on a stretcher once with what was feared to 
be a broken neck. He collided with the famous Green Monster while chasing a 
line drive in the corner. 
</P>
<P>
Another time, he got hit on the wrist with a pitch in mid-season -- and found 
out after the season was over that he played since then with a broken hand. 
</P>
<P>
He couldn't crack the Dodger lineup while Cey and Baker were in it and, when he 
got traded to Minnesota, he found Gary Gaetti in his way. Still, the only year 
in his major league career he got over 500 at-bats, he hit better than .300 -- 
.302, in fact -- drove in 69 runs and scored 61. 
</P>
<P>
"I put the bat on the ball," he admits. "I'm the kind of hitter the pitchers 
hate to see come up. I either have no weakness -- or I'm all weakness. They 
make a good pitch and I flare it somewhere for a double. They try to waste a 
pitch and I hit it off a wall. I drive them nuts." 
</P>
<P>
Most World Series heroes, when they star in a game, can tell you all about it 
-- not only how many were on base but who. Also, who was pitching, what he 
threw, the direction of the wind, time of day, relative humidity, where the 
pitch was, what the count was, what the temperature was and whether the infield 
was playing in or back. 
</P>
<P>
About all Mickey Hatcher can remember is who was President. 
</P>
<P>
He can't for the life of him remember the circumstances of the two homers and 
the five RBIs he had in the series. Hatcher has no memory for trivia. 
</P>
<P>
For the record, Mickey's first Series home run was hit off Dave Stewart. The 
Oakland pitcher had just hit leadoff batter Steve Sax, apparently in 
retaliation for Dodger pitcher Tim Belcher having hit the A's Jose Canseco in 
Oakland's half of the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
If so, Stewart hit the wrong batter. He should have saved the get-even pitch 
for Hatcher. Because Mickey Hatcher hit the first pitch into the left-field 
seats for a 2-0 Los Angeles lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers hadn't put Mickey in the lineup for his bat but for his attitude. 
It happened after the first game in the playoff series against the New York 
Mets. The Dodgers, leading, 2-0, going into the ninth, had blown the lead and 
the game. The team was down. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Tommy Lasorda remembers looking over and seeing a crestfallen lot of 
ballplayers. All except Mickey Hatcher, who was going around with his hat on 
backward, making faces. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets didn't bother Mickey Hatcher. Nothing bothers Mickey Hatcher. 
</P>
<P>
World Series heroes come in all shapes and sizes. They're often as unlikely as 
Pepper Martin in 1931 or as predictable as Babe Ruth in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
But none ever took over a Series as a hitter any more thoroughly than Mickey 
(Himself) Hatcher and his two home runs and a double and four singles did in 
1988. He has a hard job remembering them but the rest of baseball will never 
forget them.

Tom Lasorda snarled at me the other day. Orel Hershiser was charming. Fred 
Claire was justifiably proud of his performance as Dodger executive vice 
president. The team won a ballgame from Minnesota. But Tom Lasorda snarled. 
</P>
<P>
"Not a very warm spring greeting," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"You know why," Lasorda said, and looked away in anger. 
</P>
<P>
I'm afraid I do know why. Lasorda is one of that band of baseball people who 
feel that I should somehow have protected Al Campanis, when he began immolating 
himself on the Dodgers' opening night of the 1987 baseball season. 
</P>
<P>
We were to work the "Nightline" show and celebrate the 40th anniversary of 
Jackie Robinson's major league debut. But our time on ABC would not be that 
simple. Ted Koppel is a brilliant interviewer who could, if he were here, 
squeeze controversy out of an orange. Before going live with Koppel, it is a 
good idea to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
At 3 o'clock in the afternoon, one of Koppel's people telephoned and asked what 
I thought Robinson would feel about the state of blacks in baseball today. 
There is an easy answer. "Jack would be pleased. In his era, marginal players 
went to the minors. Today, marginal blacks people every roster in the major 
leagues." 
</P>
<P>
There is one problem with that answer. I don't believe it to be so. Robinson 
retired in 1956, after the Dodgers had announced that they were trading him to 
the Giants, a move that didn't make much sense except as an ego trip for 
several Dodger executives. 
</P>
<P>
That is an old story in baseball, trading a great player, indulging one's 
power. The Yankees shipped portly Babe Ruth off to the Siberia that was the 
Boston Braves. The Reds let Pete Rose go to Philadelphia in 1979, the very 
season after Rose had batted safely in 44 consecutive games. But Robinson, as 
the first black player in the majors, held unique symbolic status. The Dodgers 
integrated baseball with Jack and it remains impossible to imagine him wearing 
any uniform but Dodger blue. 
</P>
<P>
Hurt, even humiliated, Robinson responded by retiring. To tide himself over, he 
sold the retirement announcement to Look magazine for $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
He then tried his hand at business. 
</P>
<P>
"Have you thought about managing in the major leagues?" I asked one night at 
Robinson's mansion in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course I've thought about managing," he said. "I think I know how you're 
supposed to play the game. But you can't be a manager unless you get asked." 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody asked?" 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody in the major leagues. There was one call from the Vancouver club in the 
Pacific Coast League. I told them, sure, I was interested. They never called 
back." 
</P>
<P>
Jackie was hurting. "What the hell," he said. "I've got other things to do. I 
don't enjoy watching baseball that much anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Now it was almost 11:30 at night in New York and a director fitted a receiver 
into my left ear. 
</P>
<P>
"Good evening," Ted Koppel said, in his formal way. "I have to tell you that I 
grew up in England. I'm not familiar with baseball. You're going to have to 
carry the show." 
</P>
<P>
Various nerves became electric. Nobody carries "Nightline" but Ted Koppel. 
</P>
<P>
After some tape we went live and Koppel asked the question I had heard in the 
afternoon. I rejected the bland answer for a truthful one. I didn't think 
Robinson would be pleased with the state of blacks in baseball because, as we 
spoke, there were no black club owners, no black general managers, nor any 
black field managers in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Koppel switched to Campanis in Houston, where the Dodgers were playing, and 
asked if what I had said was true and if so, to what did Mr. Campanis attribute 
it. Campanis said blacks lack the "necessities" to manage. Before he was 
through he added that blacks lacked buoyancy and couldn't swim either. 
</P>
<P>
At length, and after what seemed severe provocation, I put in this with 
sarcasm: "I understand, Al. Do blacks have the intelligence to work in the 
fields, the cotton fields, the baseball fields? Yes. But do they have the 
intelligence to manage? No." 
</P>
<P>
Within two days Campanis was out of baseball and Fred Claire was installed as 
the Dodgers' de facto general manager. 
</P>
<P>
I had known Campanis for three decades and had heard the story of his life, 
mostly a useful and productive one. He wanted to find a writer who could use 
his adventures as a basis for a novel. I had never heard him make a racist 
remark. When Jackie Robinson's name came up, Campanis spoke with apparent pride 
of playing shortstop to Robinson's second base at Montreal in the International 
League during 1946. He had taught Robinson the double-play pivot, Campanis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
My reaction to his comment about black managers consisted of incredulity and 
shock. With Koppel hammering away at me, it was some time before I realized 
that I was watching a man destroy his own career. But by then Campanis had said 
so many repugnant things, that I wouldn't have bailed him out if I could have. 
And I could not. 
</P>
<P>
A few days later in the Cincinnati clubhouse, Eric Davis, the Reds' wonderful 
young center fielder, said, "I saw you get Campanis on TV." 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't get him. He got himself." 
</P>
<P>
"But you put in a zinger." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, of course, is black and I retreated until after the game. Then I said, 
"Eric, can you swim?" 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a darn good swimmer." 
</P>
<P>
"Campanis says you lack buoyancy." 
</P>
<P>
Davis broke into an enormous smile. "I was just putting you on, and I got you, 
didn't I?" 
</P>
<P>
Other responses were less amusing. 
</P>
<P>
A great Hall of Famer said, "We can't have Jesse Jackson picking our managers." 
</P>
<P>
A prominent front-office man said that very few blacks went to major league 
games, so why should baseball bother hiring black managers. 
</P>
<P>
Friends in the Dodger organization say that they wish the Campanis story would 
recede into history, which does not seem like sensible journalism to me. When 
Campanis, Koppel and I spoke, three blacks had managed in the major leagues, 
none with success. These were Frank Robinson, Maury Wills and Larry Doby. 
</P>
<P>
Now, two years later, how many blacks have managed in the major leagues? The 
same three names. So with all the noise and hurt and anger, nothing has 
happened. Roughly a third of the major league players are black. Frank Robinson 
works in Baltimore, and 25 of the 26 managers are white. Jackie Robinson would 
not have cared for that at all. 
</P>
<P>
Where is the talent? Surely Lou Brock was as game-smart as any player in his 
time, possibly excepting Pete Rose. When I last saw Brock, he was playing in 
old-timers' games and running flower shops. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Gibson's competitive blaze was a wonder of the Western world. He was out of 
baseball, he said a while ago, and passing his days building decks for friends. 
</P>
<P>
"If you lived in Omaha, I'd build a deck for you," Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson as a manager? Can pitchers make good managers? Lasorda was a pitcher. No 
one can possibly manage more skillfully than Lasorda did last season. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Dodgers integrated baseball, it was particularly distressing to 
hear a Dodger executive speak as Campanis did. But the integration of blacks as 
managers is not a Dodger problem. It is a baseball problem. What Campanis was 
rash enough to utter on network television is, in effect, what some, surely not 
all, baseball executives have said privately for many years. 
</P>
<P>
It now seems as if I have to choose between suffering Lasorda's snarl and being 
faithful to the memory of Jackie Robinson. That is not a difficult choice at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
Would I today do anything differently on "Nightline" than I did in 1987? On 
sober tertiary thought, I might have worn a more assertive necktie.

Former UCLA basketball player Darrell Allums was convicted of robbing cash and 
soft drinks from eight Domino's Pizza deliverymen in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court jury in Torrance found Allums, 30, guilty of seven counts of 
armed robbery and one count of simple, non-armed robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Allums, a 6-9 backup center on the UCLA team that advanced to the NCAA finals 
in 1980, faces up to 13 years in state prison at his scheduled sentencing April 
3. He remains in custody in lieu of $100,000 bail.

SCOTT OSTLER: DOUG RADER HAS YET TO OFFEND ANYONE, BUT IT'S STILL EARLY

<P>
The biggest disappointment of spring training? 
</P>
<P>
That's easy. Doug Rader. 
</P>
<P>
Or, I should say, the alleged Doug Rader. 
</P>
<P>
When Angel General Manager Mike Port decided to hire Rader to mismanage the 
ballclub, Port didn't have to enter a bidding war. Rader's only previous big 
league managing experience was with the Texas Rangers. If Rader wasn't despised 
by every person in Texas when the Rangers fired him in 1985, it's because he 
was there only two years and it's a big state. 
</P>
<P>
Most guys, you give them a chance to manage in the big leagues and no matter 
how badly they bungle the job, they're in the managerial pool forever. Rader's 
debut was so rocky, though, you had to figure his managerial future was behind 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Why Port wanted to hire this human storm cloud was anybody's guess. All I knew 
was we had every right to expect Rader to arrive at Angel camp in a smoldering 
fury, which is a state of mind, not a model of car. 
</P>
<P>
This would be an exciting spring, and it was our due. Why should the New York 
Mets have all the fun? Why should the Boston Red Sox corner the market on 
dissension and character assassination? 
</P>
<P>
We sportswriters were thrilled at the prospects of the Rader era. We wouldn't 
have to write about sore arms, now that we were blessed with baseball's 
original sorehead. All we would have to do was ask questions, and duck. 
</P>
<P>
Very early in camp, however, ominous rumors began to circulate. Rader was seen 
petting dogs, joking around with kids, having nice talks with his players, even 
offering soft drinks and pizza to sportswriters who ventured into his office. 
In two weeks, it was whispered, he had yet to utter a negative word. 
</P>
<P>
I motor over to Mesa in a smoldering Ford to check out the rumors. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, they are true. Rader is a shell of his former managerial self. 
</P>
<P>
He greets me, a total stranger carrying a notebook, with a smile, if not a 
pizza. He doesn't flinch when I ask him about the reaction among Angel fans to 
his hiring. Here is a man whose reputation preceded him like garlic breath. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt that (the public reaction) was anything earth-shattering, until the 
media got involved," Rader says. "Most people didn't know or care what a Doug 
Rader was. What happened in Texas was of little importance to them, until 
unfortunate things got resurrected, things that were pretty much disfavorable." 
</P>
<P>
Here we go. Rader is about to tee off on the sleaze-mongering jackals of the 
sporting press. Let spring training begin! 
</P>
<P>
But the disarming smile remains. He clears his throat and continues. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying (the advance bad publicity) was wrong," Rader said. "It was 
much to my advantage to have all that stuff exposed, to get it out of the way, 
to purge it all at one time. 'I . . . up, let's try it again.' " 
</P>
<P>
I try again to set Rader up with a letter-high lob. I remark on the difference 
between Rader the Ranger and Rader the Angel. Did he achieve the marked 
personality transformation with the aid of psychological counseling? 
</P>
<P>
"My mistakes were so obvious," Rader says, still smiling, "I didn't need any 
help analyzing them. They weren't deep-seated. Basically I tried too hard, too 
fast. I took myself too seriously. I thought I could make a direct impact in a 
hurry. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't push, belittle and prod over any length of time and expect a team to 
survive it. You can't have an adversary relationship with anyone over a length 
of time without exhausting everyone." 
</P>
<P>
It is becoming clear that this is a man who, over the last two years, has been 
using his considerable native intelligence to dissect a colossal failure, to 
assume responsibility for it and to use it as a tool for self-betterment. 
</P>
<P>
Either that or he drove a golf cart under a low-hanging tree branch. 
</P>
<P>
Rader vows to motivate his players with reasoning and kindness rather than 
using the sneer-and-insult style that helped make his stay in Dallas short but 
bitter. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe in the adage that you should never be close to a player," he 
says. "It's important to be close to a player. I think players will take less 
advantage of you if they know you like them. No question I can be a 
disciplinarian. My problem before was timing. I'd try to correct a situation on 
the spot, rather than waiting for a more genteel time." 
</P>
<P>
We shouldn't give up on Rader yet. It's still spring. The Angels have yet to 
blow a real game, the press has yet to pounce on strategic mistake or 
second-guess Rader's pitching rotation or compare him unfavorably to Cookie 
Rojas. 
</P>
<P>
The season is young. Unborn, in fact. So far, though, Doug Rader has been a 
terrible disappointment.

KERSEE HOPES TO REPLACE DEVERS WITH A BALANCED UCLA TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Kersee, UCLA women's track coach, reasons that it takes the equivalent of 
three athletes to replace Gail Devers. 
</P>
<P>
Devers, an accomplished multi-event performer who led the Bruins to the Pacific 
10 Conference championship the last two seasons and second place in the 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. meet in 1988, has graduated. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Kersee expects a balanced team to make up for her absence. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the team are sprinter-hurdler Janeene Vickers and weight event star 
Kris Larson. 
</P>
<P>
As a freshman, Vickers placed fourth in the 400-meter hurdles in the NCAA meet 
and then anchored the 1,600-meter relay team to victory. 
</P>
<P>
Larson won the javelin, discus and shotput in the USC dual meet last year and 
placed fourth in the discus in the NCAA meet, one place behind teammate Tracie 
Millett. 
</P>
<P>
Other athletes with NCAA meet experience are relay runners Tonya Sedwick and 
Caryl Smith, hurdler Nikki Williams and 1500-meter runner Laura Chapel. 
</P>
<P>
Kersee has benefited from a good recruiting class, namely middle-distance 
runners Jennifer Ashe and Kristi Bache, triple jumper Brooke Bartholomew and 
half-miler LaMonica Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Bailey, first year USC coach who succeeded Fred LaPlante, now at Eastern 
Michigan, has lost two top athletes, Wendy Brown and Yvette Bates. 
</P>
<P>
Brown and Bates, the long- and triple-jump tandem, were mainly responsible for 
USC's top-10 finishes in the NCAA meet the past three years. Brown was also the 
1988 NCAA heptathlon champion and a member of the U.S. Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans, however, will be bolstered by the return of Leslie Maxie, who 
red-shirted last season while earning a place on the U.S. Olympic team in the 
400-meter hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
Among other athletes who figure to contribute are sprinters Michelle Taylor and 
Louan Guialdo, hurdler Karen Koellner, high jumper Yleana Carrasco and Lesley 
Noll, the school record-holder in the 800 at 2 minutes 3.30 seconds, and the 
1,500 at 4:17.25. 
</P>
<P>
Promising newcomers are hurdler Michelle DeCoux, a double winner last year at 
the California high school state meet, and 800-1,500 runners Amy Goodwin, 
Robbyn Bryant and Tracy Boudreau. MAL FLORENCE

1989 PREP SOFTBALL PREVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
FOUNTAIN VALLEY IS EXPECTED TO LEAD BY EXPERIENCE

<P>
Orange County softball figures to feature a little more hitting this season, 
but the best teams figure to be the ones with the top pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a look at the top 10 teams: 
</P>
<P>
1. FOUNTAIN VALLEY 
</P>
<P>
It is tough enough for opponents that Fountain Valley has Orange County's best 
pitcher in sophomore Rae Rice, but the Barons also return 12 players, including 
seven starters and eight seniors. Last year, Fountain Valley went 24-7, won the 
Sunset League title and advanced to the semifinals of the Southern Section 4-A 
playoffs before losing to eventual champion St. Paul. 
</P>
<P>
"Our strength is experience," said Coach Cary Baker, who begins his 10th season 
at Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
All-Southern Section players Rice, who was 16-9 last season with an earned-run 
average of 0.18, and sophomore catcher Shannon Dolan return, along with six 
all-Sunset League players. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Baker's team played Gahr and its pitcher Dede Weiman, who has signed 
a letter of intent to attend UCLA, to a 13-inning 0-0 tie in a game called 
because of darkness. And Baker did not even use Rice. Instead, sophomore Janet 
Miyahara pitched against Gahr. 
</P>
<P>
2. KENNEDY 
</P>
<P>
The Fighting Irish have lost some strength from last season's 25-5 team that 
won the Garden Grove League and Southern Section 3-A titles. All-Southern 
Section first baseman Deanna Mays (.333) and All-Garden Grove League second 
baseman and backup pitcher Lauri Graper (.324) are gone. 
</P>
<P>
But Kennedy has five returning starters, two of whom were all-Southern Section 
players. One is sophomore left-hander Cheryl Longeway, who coaches tab as the 
top pitcher in the county behind Rice. 
</P>
<P>
The other is senior center fielder Suzie Berdis, who batted .299 last season. 
</P>
<P>
Longeway went 23-3, finishing with 235 strikeouts and giving up 58 hits against 
623 batters for an ERA of 0.37. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we will be very strong defensively," Coach Sue Hall said. "The only 
thing we have to do this year to do well is to execute offensively, to run our 
plays correctly." 
</P>
<P>
3. CANYON 
</P>
<P>
Coach Lance Eddy's Canyon team got a big boost last week when Chanele Chambrone 
moved within the Canyon attendance boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
Chambrone was one of the county's leading hitters last season (.520) and an 
All-Southern Section 3-A catcher at Tustin High. 
</P>
<P>
Chambrone, who also plays first and third, fortifies an already strong infield 
that includes junior third baseman Krissy Kyriazis, senior shortstop Jill 
Player and sophomore second baseman Dalynne Large. 
</P>
<P>
Pitching is the major question mark for the Comanches. Sara Roberts, 6-3 last 
season, and Kristen Heizer, a transfer from Northern California, will share the 
pitching duties. 
</P>
<P>
"Our strength is defense and our hitting is probably as good as anybody's," 
said Eddy, who last year led his team to an 18-9 record and an appearance in 
the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
4. WESTERN 
</P>
<P>
Coach Debbie Harless has eight returning starters from last year's 16-11 team 
that won the Orange League title and advanced to the quarterfinals of the 
Southern Section 3-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"Defense is our strength, no doubt about it," said Harless, whose entire 
starting infield returns. 
</P>
<P>
The members of that infield are all-league catcher Lisa Sciarrino, the 
Pioneers' top hitter; third baseman Misty Pinkerton; Pinkerton's sister, Ivy, 
an all-league shortstop/pitcher; second baseman Collene Conahan, and Dena 
Petersen, who plays first base and pitches. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Beth Queypo and Dawn Fowler will handle the pitching. 
</P>
<P>
5. SUNNY HILLS 
</P>
<P>
Sheri Lazzarini returns as a varsity coach after serving as an assistant from 
1986-87. She coached Sonora's varsity last season. The Lancers have five 
starters returning from last season's 16-14 team, which won the Freeway League 
title for the third consecutive year but lost in the second round of the 3-A 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Talented freshmen Stacey Thurber (first base) and Suzanne Hernandez (left 
field) will move into starting positions, Lazzarini said. 
</P>
<P>
All-Freeway League catcher Erin McKenney returns for her senior year. "She is a 
real consistent ballplayer with a good strong arm," Lazzarini said. 
</P>
<P>
But the player of impact is senior left-handed pitcher Amy Huett, the league's 
most valuable player last year. 
</P>
<P>
"The franchise is Amy Huett at pitcher," Lazzarini said. "The only thing we 
need to work on is our offense." 
</P>
<P>
6. LAGUNA HILLS 
</P>
<P>
Third-year Coach Cary Crouch has eight starters back from last year's 20-10 
team that lost the 2-A championship to Woodbridge after finishing second to the 
Warriors in the Pacific Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
Crouch lost shortstop Erika Schlitz (Ohio State) to graduation, but the rest of 
the infield returns. Freshman Torin Lee will step in at first, and all-league 
selections Carolyn Langfield and Lori Sommers will play shortstop and second 
base, respectively. Kelly Besser, who played third last season, will play 
first. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Margo Melendrez gives the Hawks solid pitching. Last season, the 
All-Southern Section pitcher went 19-9 with an 0.35 ERA and batted .354. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say consistency describes us," Crouch said. 
</P>
<P>
7. TRABUCO HILLS 
</P>
<P>
Mike Flanegin begins his first season at Trabuco Hills after leading Esperanza 
out of the Empire League cellar for the first time in five years and to a 
second-place finish. He brings his stepdaughters, junior shortstop Linda 
Lunceford, a power hitter and a first-team all-league selection her freshman 
and sophomore years at Esperanza, and freshman Christy Lunceford, who will play 
at third base and catcher. 
</P>
<P>
Amy de la Cruz, a right fielder from Pacifica, also transferred to the school. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the Mustangs have four returning starters. One of them is pitcher 
Marta Bickert, who as a freshman last year had an ERA of 0.89. 
</P>
<P>
8. BREA-OLINDA 
</P>
<P>
Fifth-year Coach Sharen Caperton has eight players back from last year, 
including all-Southern Section 3-A selections Tricia Bar (shortstop) and Kelly 
Cook (pitcher). 
</P>
<P>
"I would say Kelly is one of the top five pitchers in Orange County," said 
Caperton, whose Wildcats went 16-6 last year and tied for third with Savannah 
in the Orange League. 
</P>
<P>
"She throws everything. She has an awesome fastball, a rise, drop, curve . . . 
she has a real nice changeup. She does every pitch." 
</P>
<P>
Cook, a senior who has been the starting pitcher all three years, went 15-6 
last season and struck out 219 of 539 batters and had an ERA of 0.23. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now we are playing together," Caperton said. "We just won our own 
tournament Saturday for the first time in four years. That is a real good sign. 
</P>
<P>
"Defense is the strength. We have the pitching and we have the defense, and our 
bats are coming alive. If we have patience at the plate, we'll do just fine." 
</P>
<P>
9. GARDEN GROVE 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove has pitching depth. Junior pitcher Stephanie Smith plays on one of 
the top five traveling all-star teams in the country, the Ball Hawks, in the 
off-season and should return strong. Celeste Gordon, another solid pitcher, 
backs up Smith. 
</P>
<P>
The Argonauts are quicker offensively than last season's team that went 14-15 
and placed third in the Garden Grove League under Coach Paula Cervantes. 
Shortstop Michelle Cash hit .325 last season as a freshman, and Garden Grove 
has a sound catcher in Becky Eggers. 
</P>
<P>
10. MATER DEI 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-year Coach Cathy Quesnell has three "really talented" freshmen in 
Jennifer Cline, Amy Moeller and Terri Kobata. 
</P>
<P>
Kobata and Moeller will be the No. 1 and 2 pitchers, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs have six returning starters from last year's team that went 
15-8-1, placed third in the Angelus League and lost to Cypress in the first 
round of the 4-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Returners Beth Lomeli and Tracy Rice will play left field and third base, 
respectively. Other returners are third baseman Sundy Mosqueda and shortstop 
Rose Imbriano. 
</P>
<P>
Other teams to consider: La Quinta, Marina, Woodbridge, Villa Park and Savanna.

1989 PREP SOFTBALL PREVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
SUPERSTAR PITCHERS HAVE LEFT THE FIELD WIDE OPEN TO SUCCESSORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY NISTA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michele Granger has left for Northern California. Tiffany Boyd now slings 
softballs at UCLA. Terry Carpenter is piling up the strikeouts at Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
Well, there goes the county. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's not that bad. Perhaps it's just a lull in the cycle, a void between 
yesterday's superstars of high school softball in Orange County and tomorrow's. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a changing of the guard," said Cary Baker, coach of the county's 
top-ranked team at Fountain Valley High School. "People know these new kids are 
good, but they have not made a name for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
When the names will be made and the niches carved is difficult to tell, but two 
things seem clear -- hitting should improve, at least slightly, and talent will 
be more spread out, from seniors to freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, ask coaches about the best talent around the county and the same 
names come up: Rae Rice, a sophomore pitcher at Fountain Valley; Chanele 
Chambrone, a senior catcher at Canyon; Cheryl Longeway, a sophomore pitcher at 
Kennedy, and Shannon Dolan, a senior catcher at Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"There was more great pitching in last year's freshman crop than in many 
years," Laguna Hills Coach Cary Crouch said. "It's just going to take some time 
for them to get their stats. 
</P>
<P>
"There's more good pitchers spread out among the leagues this year. We might 
not have all those no-hitters and one-hitters, but you will still see the two- 
and three-hitters." 
</P>
<P>
The dominant senior pitchers in the Southern Section hang out in Los Angeles 
County, with Lisa Fernandez at St. Joseph of Lakewood and DeDe Weiman at Gahr. 
In Orange County, Rice and Longeway are expected to be the top pitchers. But 
the question remains, will the game stay limited to the pitcher, catcher and 
umpire? 
</P>
<P>
"Even off Rice in a scrimmage against Fountain Valley, we made contact," Canyon 
Coach Lance Eddy said. "(Talent is) pretty spread out and balanced. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year was an excellent graduating class. Now, I think the sophomore and 
junior classes are equal." 
</P>
<P>
Already, many more 4-2 and 3-1 games are showing up in the box scores, and 
hitting promises to improve once teams settle into league play. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope so," Western Coach Debbie Harless said. "It's been a pitchers' game too 
long. I'd like to see the hitting come around." 
</P>
<P>
Here's a look at this season's top players: 
</P>
<P>
PITCHERS 
</P>
<P>
Shannon Akau, Buena Park: She is considered one of the better pitchers in the 
county, but she might not be good enough to save Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
Marta Bickert, Trabuco Hills: She had a 0.89 ERA with 11 shutouts and batted 
.350 as a junior last season. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Brundage, Irvine: A sophomore on the verge of becoming a great 
pitcher, she might make a big splash in a league deep in pitching. With a 
strong fastball and changeup, Brundage could give the Vaqueros a better chance 
at the South Coast League title. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Cook, Brea-Olinda: She posted 219 strikeouts and an 0.23 ERA as a junior 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Amy Huett, Sunny Hills: One of the better senior pitchers in the county, she 
throws for one of the county's underrated teams. 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Longeway, Kennedy: She led the Fighting Irish to the Southern Section 
3-A title last year as a freshman with 23-3 record, 0.48 ERA and 188 
strikeouts. Longeway said she's not quite as nervous this season, but still 
needs to work on control. 
</P>
<P>
Margo Melendrez, Laguna Hills: Possibly the best control and finesse pitcher in 
the county. Melendrez had a 0.35 ERA as a junior last season while hitting 
.354. 
</P>
<P>
Marla Pickard, Ocean View: Another virtual unknown, many coaches think she will 
helpOcean View become a pitching power again. 
</P>
<P>
Rae Rice, Fountain Valley: The sophomore earned second-team all-county honors 
last season for compiling 216 strikeouts and an 0.18 ERA for a team that 
reached the Southern Section 4-A semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Wehren, Woodbridge: She has a tough assignment in filling the cleats of 
pitcher Tiffany Boyd, but most coaches feel Wehren is up to the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
POSITION PLAYERS 
</P>
<P>
Suzie Berdis, Kennedy: She hit .299 with 22 runs and 18 RBIs last year. The 
senior center fielder is a catalyst for the Fighting Irish offense. 
</P>
<P>
Chanele Chambrone, Canyon: The Comanches will rely on their hitting this year 
and the transfer from Tustin (.516 batting average and 22 RBIs) is a big boost 
at bat and behind the plate. 
</P>
<P>
Shannon Dolan, Fountain Valley: Besides handling Rice behind the plate, she hit 
.301 last year with a school-record 28 hits. 
</P>
<P>
Krissy Kyriazis, Canyon: The third baseman hit .290 last year and played stingy 
defense. She is hitting .545 this season. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Lunceford, Trabuco Hills: A transfer from Esperanza, she hit .375 last 
year while pitching and playing shortstop. A junior, she will play shortstop 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Erin McKenney, Sunny Hills: She is among an elite group of catchers in the 
county. McKenney doesn't hit for power, but most coaches expect her to keep a 
high average while catching Huett. 
</P>
<P>
Ivy Pinkerton, Western: She switched duties between pitcher and shortstop last 
year, but this year, the senior is likely to remain at shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
Kris Vucurevic, Kennedy: Yet another of the county's best catchers, she handles 
one of the county's best pitchers in Longeway. Vucurevic helped lead Kennedy to 
the Southern Section 3-A title last year. 
</P>
<P>
Christa Yorke, Marina: Relatively unknown, she has caught the eyes of a few 
coaches, who say she will be one of the better catchers this year. 
</P>
<P>
OTHERS TO WATCH 
</P>
<P>
Tricia Barr, a senior shortstop at Brea-Olinda; Shelley Carey, a sEnior catcher 
at Villa Park; Collene Conahan, a freshman pitcher at Western; Missi Gyde, a 
senior shortstop at Kennedy; Terri Kobata, a freshman pitcher at Mater Dei; 
Krinon Lapihuska, a junior pitcher at Loara; Paige Lauby, a junior pitcher at 
El Toro; Carrie Lucas, a senior pitcher at El Dorado; Beth Queypo, a freshman 
pitcher at Western; Sara Roberts, a sophomore pitcher at Canyon; Sami Sawyer, a 
senior third baseman at Fountain Valley; Jennifer Smith, a sophomore pitcher at 
Capistrano Valley, and Stephanie Wills, a senior second baseman at Canyon.

MARINA'S ROSS NAMED TOPS IN SUNSET LEAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sandra Ross of Marina High School has been named player of the year in the 
Sunset League in a vote of the league's girls' soccer coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Ross, a senior sweeper, helped guide Marina to the league championship, making 
it the only team in eight years to beat Edison, this season's runner-up, for 
the league title. Ross, a two-year starter, contributed to 10 shutouts.

Mitsubishi ranks among Japan's four largest auto makers. And for years, 
consumers in Europe have regarded Mitsubishi as the Asian equivalent of the 
BMW: stylish, sporty, even sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
But until recently, American consumers at mention of the Mitsubishi name were 
as likely to think of electronics or banking as automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
"In Detroit, people have never even heard of Mitsubishi," said George Peterson, 
president of Auto Pacific Group, a Newport Beach automotive consulting firm. 
That may be a slight exaggeration, but in an age when Hyundai quickly became a 
household word in the United States, recognition of Mitsubishi's arrival so far 
has spread more slowly. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Cypress-based Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America ranked a lowly 
seventh in U.S. sales among 10 Asian auto makers and had less than 
three-quarters of 1% of the U.S. market. But in 1989, it hopes to capture the 
attention and sales that so far have proven elusive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overcoming Shortage 
</P>
<P>
With a new manufacturing plant in Illinois, a big new advertising campaign that 
features Los Angeles Dodger Orel Hershiser, and rave reviews for its newest 
models, Mitsubishi figures that a turnaround is at hand. 
</P>
<P>
In January, Mitsubishi's first U.S. manufacturing plant began turning out the 
firm's best-selling car, the sporty Eclipse, overcoming a shortage that once 
choked growth. The company has doubled its network television advertising 
budget and boosted its total ad budget to $80 million -- a 35% increase. And 
the auto maker plans to add 85 dealerships in 65 new markets this year, for a 
total of 350. 
</P>
<P>
"Our plan is to expand the exposure of Mitsubishi to America's heartland," said 
Jeanne Hoover, Mitsubishi's manager of promotion and merchandising. "That means 
to have consumer recognition and it may eventually mean 475 dealerships." 
</P>
<P>
The push couldn't have come at a better time for Mitsubishi. Its Galant sedan 
has been named import car of the year by Motor Trend magazine, and all four of 
the company's other new cars have won awards in categories like "best buy" or 
one of the "10 best." 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser is the pitchman for Mitsubishi's "Five-for-Five" television and radio 
ads that promote the company's five award-winning models. The Cy Young Award 
winner was signed in December as a spokesman for Southern California dealers. 
Now, the firm is considering making Hershiser its national spokesman and part 
of its effort to establish its name in Iowa and Indiana, as well as California 
and New York, where up to now most Mitsubishis have been sold. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our window of opportunity. There's no fluke about it, and we're 
telling everyone," said Bruce McRitchie, executive vice president of Grey 
Advertising, which has created the award-centered campaign. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Well Known Elsewhere 
</P>
<P>
In other parts of the world, Mitsubishi's name is nothing new. In 1987, 
Mitsubishi Motors Corp., the parent company, built 1.2 million cars in Japan, 
or 10% of all cars made there. In Japan, Toyota and Nissan are the largest auto 
makers, while Mitsubishi and Honda scrap for third place. 
</P>
<P>
And Mitsubishi was a big seller in New Zealand, West Germany and Finland before 
it ever began selling cars in America. 
</P>
<P>
"When Mitsubishi first appeared in England in 1975, it was the BMW of Japan. 
Everyone knew Mitsubishi made fine cars," said John Rettie, an editor at J. D. 
Power &amp; Associates, an Agoura Hills auto consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
While Toyota, Nissan and Honda jumped into the U.S. market by establishing 
their own distributor network in the early 1970s, Mitsubishi chose a different 
strategy: It sold its cars to Chrysler. 
</P>
<P>
That meant that Mitsubishi was earning revenue in the United States but gaining 
no name recognition with consumers. One-fifth of Mitsubishi Motors Corp. is 
owned by Chrysler. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America, the U.S. marketer and distributor of 
Mitsubishis, began selling cars in America in the final months of 1982. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Took Much Patience 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Mitsubishi's domestic sales were only one-tenth those of Toyota. And 
Chrysler, which since 1970 has sold Mitsubishis under its own name, sells many 
more of the models than Mitsubishi Motor Sales. For instance, the sporty 
Mitsubishi Eclipse is sold as the Plymouth Laser by Chrysler. 
</P>
<P>
"When we started in 1982, we knew it would be tough. We knew we were late. It's 
taken a great deal of patience," said Dick Recchia, Mitsubishi's executive vice 
president. In 1983, 32,755 cars were sold, and annual sales had climbed to just 
49,439 by 1986. 
</P>
<P>
With 70 dealers in 1982, the company didn't make the instant splash that 
low-price South Korean auto maker Hyundai made when it came to the United 
States in 1986 and opened hundreds of dealerships that sold more than 150,000 
relatively low-priced cars. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi originally set up its U.S. headquarters in Los Angeles, but outgrew 
those offices in 1983 and moved to rented facilities in Fountain Valley, 
becoming the first of several Asian auto makers to locate in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The Big Three Asian auto makers have remained in the Torrance and Gardena area 
since coming to America. And Mazda, Suzuki, Daihatsu and Hyundai have made 
their headquarters in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi moved last year to Cypress, where it built a seven-floor 
headquarters on part of a 22-acre complex it bought six years ago. The land 
also includes a Mitsubishi design studio, research lab, parts distribution 
center, and training and engineering centers. More than 350 people work for the 
company in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sales Have Jumped 
</P>
<P>
The new assembly plant in Bloomington, Ill., is expected to provide 37,000 
Lasers to Chrysler and 37,000 Eclipses to Mitsubishi this year. When the plant 
reaches its expected full production next year, 60,000 of each model will be 
produced. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, Mitsubishi sales are up more than 20%, after a 6% increase in 
1988, when 70,075 cars were sold. This year, the company expects to sell 
130,000 cars. 
</P>
<P>
Every day, car shoppers drop into Costa Mesa Mitsubishi for their first visit 
ever to a Mitsubishi lot, according to Joe Coons, general manager of the 
dealership, which opened in late 1982. "They say, 'Boy, I've never even been in 
a Mitsubishi. . . . We've been on this street longer than most dealers around. 
And only now do people realize we're here." 
</P>
<P>
Rettie, at J. D. Powers, said Mitsubishi's recent attention is "rather like a 
woman becoming Miss America. She was no different without the title. But 
suddenly people are saying she's the best."

PACIFIC SCIENTIFIC AGREES TO PAY $7 MILLION TO SETTLE SHAREHOLDERS' 
CLASS-ACTION SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pacific Scientific Co. said Monday it has agreed to pay $7 million in cash and 
stock to settle a class-action lawsuit filed by shareholders who accused the 
Newport Beach electronics company of making false and misleading sales 
estimates in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The immediate effect of the settlement, half in cash and half in a new series 
of preferred stock, will be a drastic increase in the company's loss last year. 
The settlement will drive the firm's annual loss to $4.1 million from its 
previously reported loss of $793,000. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement came Friday morning after a federal court jury in Los Angeles 
had been selected to hear the suit brought by the A&amp;J Deutscher Family Fund 
of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., which bought 1,000 shares of Pacific Scientific stock 
on March 16, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement is the biggest pay-out from litigation that the 70-year-old 
company has ever made, said Richard V. Plat, the company's senior vice 
president for finance. He said the company did not admit any liability in 
settling the case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Few Details Left 
</P>
<P>
A few details in the settlement still must be ironed out, he said. The 
preferred stock, for instance, will carry a 10% interest rate, but the amount 
of time the company has to pay the principal has not been determined, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Because the lawsuit was a class action that affects all investors who bought 
stock from March 7, 1983, through Sept. 29, 1983, the final settlement must be 
approved by U.S. District Judge Pamela Ann Rymer, who has presided over the 
litigation. The company estimated that 1,000 to 2,000 shareholders could 
collect under the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a good thing for the company to settle," Plat said. "Prolonged 
litigation is a very expensive item, and you are never sure what the outcome 
will be." 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Scientific spent nearly $2 million on defense fees and costs, he said. 
The company's insurance carrier has paid half the legal fees, Plat said, and 
will pay a "substantial portion" of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the Deutscher fund could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lawsuit's Allegations 
</P>
<P>
In its 1985 lawsuit, the Deutscher fund claimed that Pacific Scientific 
violated various federal and state securities laws. It alleged that corporate 
officers knew or should have known in 1983 that orders for the company's 
mechanical shock arresters would decline significantly. It also alleged that 
certain insiders sold shares of Pacific Scientific stock with non-public 
information. 
</P>
<P>
Mechanical shock arresters are used primarily in nuclear power plants to 
support the piping systems and protect them from possible rupture in the event 
of an earthquake or other events. 
</P>
<P>
In its 1983 annual report, issued in 1984, the company said the decline in 
sales "had been anticipated, but not at the scale at which it occurred." By the 
end of 1983, the backlog of orders for shock arresters had fallen to $6 million 
from $27 million a year earlier.

AST Research says its first personal computer targeted at the home and 
small-business market -- the recently introduced Bravo/286 -- is getting strong 
reviews from computer dealers. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bravo is doing very well," said Dan Sheppard, AST's senior manager of 
systems marketing. AST announced the new computer in early February. 
</P>
<P>
Demand for the Bravo, which carries a starting price of about $1,100, is 
currently exceeding AST's forecasts, Sheppard said. AST has had to boost 
production by 15% at the company plant in Taiwan, where the Bravo is 
manufactured. 
</P>
<P>
"We are scrambling right now to produce enough machines to keep the dealers 
stocked," Sheppard said. 
</P>
<P>
AST has shipped 3,000 of the machines and has orders for another 10,000, 
Sheppard said.

CMS EXPECTS TO RAISE $10 MILLION THROUGH PROPOSED STOCK OFFERING

<P>
CMS Enhancements Inc., a Tustin computer company, has filed papers with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission for a secondary public stock offering of 3 
million shares of common stock. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed offering is expected to raise $10 million, which CMS will use for 
general business expansion purposes, said Ted James, director of investor 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
CMS said the offering would consist of 2 million shares of newly issued common 
stock and 1 million shares to be sold by current and former CMS management. 
Also, up to 450,000 shares may be sold by the company to cover over-allotments, 
if any. 
</P>
<P>
According to James, the 1 million management shares include 500,000 shares 
owned by Mason Tarkeshian, a company co-founder and former executive vice 
president who resigned from the firm in January, and 300,000 shares held by Tom 
Ong, a former executive vice president who also left the company in January. 
</P>
<P>
CMS President Jim Farooquee is selling 100,000 of the 1.7 million shares he 
owns. And James D'jen, executive vice president of finance, is disposing of 
100,000 of the 1.7 million shares he holds.

CHAMBER ORCHESTRA GIVES THOUGHTFUL INTERPRETATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HETTMANSBERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frequent concert-goers probably fear two things above all: the same tired 
repertory and bland, faceless interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
But a combination of imaginative programming, thoroughly professional playing 
and thoughtful interpretations Sunday afternoon by Micah Levy and the Orange 
County Chamber Orchestra eliminated nearly all evidence of this same-old-thing 
syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Bach's Concerto in D minor for two violins fell victim to the 
malady. Concert mistress Diana Halprin and principal second violinist Joseph 
Goodman provided well-matched tone and articulation. Levy led neat 
accompaniments and balanced his forces well enough, yet a lack of softer 
dynamics throughout could not be blamed on any acoustical flaw in the 
auditorium at Loyola Marymount University in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
The finale came to life with a great deal more spirit, but the first two 
movements seemed little more than a polished run-through. 
</P>
<P>
The balance of the performance proved eminently satisfying, however. "Prologue 
and Variations" by Ellen Taaffe Zwilich presents tremendous challenges of 
ensemble, intonation and interpretive shaping, conquered in every respect by 
Levy and his musicians. The 1984 work gratefully provides evidence that 
Minimalism does not reign supreme in contemporary compositional technique, and 
this expressive piece passes the most important test: one wants to hear it 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Haydn's Symphony No. 83 "The Hen," received a persuasive reading, with 
full-bodied sound that belied the actual number of players (22), and 
responsiveness to every shade of the nuances of Levy's direction. Proof was at 
hand that this group articulates as one, particularly in true accents with bite 
at any dynamic level. 
</P>
<P>
The program opened with another alternative to tried-and-true programming, 
Vaughan Williams' "Five Variants on 'Dives and Lazarus.' " Levy skillfully wove 
the subtly exchanged lines of this gentle work into warmly haunting music.

PACIFIC SYMPHONY CHAMBER SERIES IN NEWPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A generally unfocused chamber program Sunday by members of the Pacific Symphony 
may be best remembered as the concert that nearly included the premiere of a 
new work by Mark McGurty. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the program promised McGurty's "Scene Concertante" for flute, harp 
and strings. But it was postponed until next season for lack of adequate 
rehearsal time, according to Pacific Symphony executive director Louis Spisto. 
</P>
<P>
The first two concerts of the series have included premieres by local composers 
Nick Ariondo and Lucas Richman. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the program changes, the varied evening at the Newport Harbor Art 
Museum showcased the admirable musicianship of the players, their painstaking 
dedication and, at times, breathtaking technique. Yet a missing sense of 
adventure often created an unfulfilled feeling. 
</P>
<P>
Mozart's Quintet in A for clarinet and string quartet proceeded in a meditative 
manner with tempos that were slightly slow. Clarinetist James Kanter's mellow, 
vibratoless tone carried most of the music, maneuvering gently through the 
arpeggios and relishable melodies. 
</P>
<P>
Ravel's Introduction and Allegro for harp, flute, clarinet and string quartet, 
laden with lush harmonies, elicited a satisfying, full sound. 
</P>
<P>
The aggressive style of harpist Mindy Ball brought home Ravel's intention of a 
small harp concerto, with fast passages and glissandos all handled with the 
right amount of vim. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the fare -- Albert Roussel's Impressionistic Trio, Opus 40 for 
flute, viola and cello, and Ingolf Dahl's Neo-Classic "Variations on a Swedish 
Folktune" for solo flute -- proved more academic in their presentations. 
Certainly there was no shortage of technical virtuosity, but at times a sense 
of being too mechanical or emotionless crept in, leaving the listener chilled.

MANY LENSES FOCUSED ON THE ESSENCE OF ORANGE COUNTY

 This is Orange County. Or, more specifically, this was Orange County as seen 
by 55 photographers over two days last year and collected in "48 Hours in 
Orange County," a traveling exhibit of 94 color photographs that seeks to 
capture the drama, the flavor and the unique personality of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
On display through March 26 at the Westminster Mall, "48 Hours in Orange 
County" features the work of local professional photographers and offers a 
glimpse of virtually every aspect of county life. The exhibit is in the midst 
of a yearlong tour of local malls, festivals and special events through the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
Loren Price, an Anaheim graphic arts consultant, coordinated the project along 
with Stan Sholik, a Santa Ana commercial photographer, and Elaine Anderson, art 
director for Newport Beach-based Cycle World magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole concept of the project was that it be about the people, by the 
people and for the people of Orange County," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
"We started working on this about 6 years ago . . . after the book 'A Day in 
the Life of Australia' had just been released," he added. "We thought something 
like that would go over well in Orange County. It was the kind of thing that 
could involve a lot of people in different ways. We just kept building from 
that foundation." 
</P>
<P>
The result: a massive 2-day photo shoot from midnight to midnight on March 18 
and 19, 1988, that yielded 33,000 color slides of Orange County at work and 
play. 
</P>
<P>
According to Price, the "48 Hours of Orange County" exhibit is a byproduct of 
the project's real goal: a special commemorative book named for the project 
that will feature the best 233 photos from the 2-day shoot. (The massive 
editing task was handled last summer by a nine-member panel that included photo 
editors from Life and Newsweek magazines as well as top free-lance 
photographers.) Set for release this July, the book will be produced primarily 
by Orange County businesses and will be available in soft cover and a 
limited-edition hard-cover version. Organizers are seeking investors to help 
meet production costs. 
</P>
<P>
The project has been endorsed by the Orange County Centennial Committee. 
Organizers of "48 Hours" plan to include a copy of the hard-cover book in the 
Orange County Centennial time capsule, a collection of memorabilia that will be 
buried on the grounds of the Old Orange County Courthouse during 
centennial-closing ceremonies on Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the profits from the sale of "48 Hours" books, which are projected to 
top $100,000, will be turned over to a philanthropic group called Artists for 
Kids, which will channel funds to "organizations that help Orange County's 
future," Price said. Charities expected to benefit include Children's Home 
Society, Childrens Hospital of Orange County and Orangewood, as well as the 
Orange County Centennial Scholarship Fund. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the 55 photographers whose work is featured in "48 Hours" are members 
of three local and national trade organizations: the Society of Illustrative 
Photographers, the American Society of Magazine Photographers and the 
Advertising Photographers of America, Price said. To determine what should be 
shot when, several of them formed a committee with project organizers to create 
a list of about 50 locations. 
</P>
<P>
On the days of the shoot, each photographer was armed with 17 rolls of film 
donated by Eastman Kodak and assigned two or three locations. Once those 
assignments were completed, said Price, they were "free to go out and burn up 
the rest (of the film) on whatever they wanted." 
</P>
<P>
The weekend of the 18th turned out to be ideal. The weather was clear, Little 
Leaguers were taking their first swings and some of the county's last cowboys 
were rounding 'em up at Rancho Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Brief captions under each print in the show (and ultimately, in the book) 
define the date, time, location, photographer's name and a brief description of 
the shot. 
</P>
<P>
Sprinkled throughout the exhibit are images instantly associated with the 
county: rush hour on the San Diego Freeway, surfers and sun-worshippers along 
the coast, a small grove of orange trees. But others offer a different, homier 
view, such as Richard Fukuhara's shot of a matron enjoying a snooze under the 
dryer at Colleen O'Hara's Beauty Academy in Orange and Howard DeCruyensere's 
two gents sharing a laugh at Watson Drug. 
</P>
<P>
The county's ethnic diversity is highlighted in several prints, such as Bruce 
Hershey's shot of a comely Mexican waitress slapping tortillas, and Stan 
Sholik's photo of the entertainer in the Asian Garden mall. Others pay tribute 
to working folks, such as Robert Earnest's shot of two grease-covered mechanics 
at work in a cluttered San Clemente garage and Don Dormeyer's print of a 
nubile, roller-skating carhop at Angelo's Drive-in in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "48 Hours of Orange County" continues on the ground floor of the Westminster 
Mall (May Co. wing) through March 26. It can be seen at The City shopping 
center in Orange from March 30 through April 19, the Orange Mall from April 10 
through 18, the Brea Mall from May 20 through 30 and the Buena Park Mall from 
June 1 through 12. Admission is free. Information: (714) 385-1351.

STATE OFFICIALS SEARCH WILSON FORD AS PART OF FRAUD INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, Times Staff Writer, 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State and local law enforcement investigators and Department of Motor Vehicles 
officials spent several hours Sunday night searching the Wilson Ford automobile 
dealership in Huntington Beach as part of an investigation into alleged 
fraudulent car sales, state officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
When the investigators left the dealership on Beach Boulevard near Ellis 
Avenue, they took with them computer data and other records, DMV spokesman Gary 
Quinliven said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an investigation of allegations of fraud in the sale of vehicles," 
Quinliven said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Quinliven nor officials with the state Justice Department, the Orange 
County District Attorney's Office or the Huntington Beach Police Department 
would divulge details of allegations, the scope of the investigation or when it 
began. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of all four agencies took part in the search, which began at 
about 7:30 p.m. Sunday and was still in progress more than five hours later. 
The group included 11 investigators from the DMV alone. 
</P>
<P>
A Justice Department spokesman said Navy personnel were also on the scene, but 
only because some of the alleged fraudulent sales were to people in the Navy. 
The Justice Department referred all further questions about the investigation 
to the DMV. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson Ford, which closed nearly four hours earlier than normal Sunday because 
of the search, was open Monday. Officials at the dealership would not speak to 
reporters, however, and in response to queries, they handed out copies of a 
press release that said little more than business was being conducted as usual. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall Mintz, an attorney for the dealership, said he did not know the reason 
for the search, what the investigators were looking for or what they took. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Reviews 
</P>
<P>
"We have always complied with requests for information," Mintz said, adding 
that the investigators were still on the scene at 1 a.m. Monday when he finally 
left and went home. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilson Ford investigation is among several ongoing reviews of Orange County 
car dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
In January, the Orange County District Attorney's Office filed a civil lawsuit 
against the Fairway dealership group, which has four showrooms in Fullerton and 
Placentia. The suit alleges that Fairway salespeople failed to tell customers 
in 29 separate instances when they were being sold cars that once had been in 
rental car agency fleets. Those cases stemmed from a review of registrations 
and sales by the DMV. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, as part of that suit, a Superior Court judge ordered Fairway to 
cease the practice and explicitly inform customers of the histories of cars 
they buy. Investigators said then that at least four other dealerships were 
suspected of the same offense, which is a violation of state consumer 
protection laws. The names of the other dealerships were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson Ford is one of the better-known auto dealerships in Southern California 
because of its frequent late-night television commercials featuring Ralph 
Williams, a well-known pitchman and former auto dealership owner.

DREXEL AGENT MADE FALSE CLAIMS, PANEL TOLD

<P>
A former federal prosecutor and private investigator whose agency was retained 
by investment banking firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. misrepresented himself 
as working for a House subcommittee looking into corporate takeovers, the 
subcommittee was told Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The allegation before the House Energy and Commerce Committee's oversight and 
investigations subcommittee was made by William G. Bertain, a Eureka, Calif., 
lawyer involved in a pending suit over the 1985 Drexel-assisted takeover of 
Pacific Lumber Co. by Maxxam Corp. of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Bertain told the subcommittee that John Gibbons, a former assistant U.S. 
attorney in California and now a private investigator for Kroll Associates, had 
told him on five occasions last year that he was seeking information about 
Maxxam's chairman, Charles Hurwitz, on behalf of a congressional subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the conversations, taped by Bertain at the request of the 
subcommittee's staff, Gibbons said he was working for the oversight and 
investigations panel, chaired by Rep. John Dingell, (D-Mich.), Bertain 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the tape of that conversation in Bertain's office was played at 
Monday's hearing, the latest in a series Dingell has held concerning Drexel's 
assistance in corporate takeovers by underwriting high-yield "junk bonds." 
</P>
<P>
Drexel agreed in principle in December to plead guilty to six charges of 
securities law violations and pay a record $650-million fine, largely in 
connection with its relationship to now-imprisoned speculator Ivan F. Boesky. 
</P>
<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission also has alleged that Drexel violated 
securities laws in Maxxam's takeover of Pacific Lumber, the largest private 
holder of redwood timberland in California. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Lumber takeover was structured by Drexel through a $300-million 
bank loan arranged by Irving Trust Co. of New York and a $450-million junk bond 
offering sold by Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbons declined Monday to answer specific questions from subcommittee members, 
saying he had received the panel's subpoena only a week ago and had not had 
adequate time to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was not aware that his conversation with Bertain in Bertain's office 
last Dec. 19 had been taped until this past weekend. 
</P>
<P>
But Gibbons' boss, Jules Kroll, principal owner of the detective agency, told 
reporters after the hearing it is "totally inconceivable" that Gibbons had 
misrepresented himself and predicted that he would be vindicated at a 
continuation of the hearing next week. 
</P>
<P>
"My man was set up by Bertain and others to get our files," said Kroll, whose 
agency specializes in corporate takeover investigations and includes among its 
clients several major investment banking firms in addition to Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the subcommittee's subpoena to Gibbons were demands for copies of 
any documents regarding Drexel, Boesky, Maxxam, Hurwitz, five other companies 
and "matters involving" securities and takeover laws in the Pacific Lumber 
takeover. Last October, Bertain filed a $2.25-billion lawsuit against Maxxam 
and Drexel on behalf of former stockholders in Pacific Lumber. 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee did not establish Monday that Gibbons was working for Drexel 
when he sought Bertain's assistance. Steven Anreder, a spokesman at Drexel's 
headquarters in New York, said he could not establish immediatedly if Gibbons 
was working on behalf of his company at the time. But Dingell said he would 
refer to the Justice Department evidence of anyone representing themselves as 
working on behalf of the subcommittee when they were not.

rose 15.3% to $82.3 million from a year ago on sales of $1.45 billion, an 
increase of 17%. Officials of the Golden Valley, Minn.-based firm said the 
gains for the period ending Feb. 26 reflected strengths in Big G cereals and 
Red Lobster and Olive Garden restaurants.

Mild Recession Predicted: A slowdown in consumer spending will tip the U.S. 
economy into a mild recession this year, but recovery will be swift, a leading 
California economist predicted. In a speech in San Francisco, Jerry Jordan, 
chief economist for First Interstate Bank, said he expects the economy to turn 
down in April and pick up in October. Consumers will cut back purchases of new 
cars, boats and other luxury items in the second and third quarters, Jordan 
said, but stronger exports will keep the manufacturing sector from being pulled 
down by the drop in consumer spending. Near the end of the summer, interest 
rates will begin to come down as the Federal Reserve Board eases its 
restrictions on the money supply, he said, and that will relieve some of the 
pressure on consumers' wallets and push the economy up.

RJR NABISCO HIRES GERSTNER AS CEO; 
</P>
<P>
AMERICAN EXPRESS PRESIDENT TERMED AN EXPERT MARKETER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RJR Nabisco on Monday said that American Express President Louis V. Gerstner 
Jr., an executive known for his marketing skills, will join the food and 
tobacco giant as its chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
It was a surprise move that analysts said will bring a top-notch leader to RJR, 
recently bought in a $25-billion deal by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. He 
will replace F. Ross Johnson, the RJR chief executive who resigned after making 
a failed bid for the company. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his lack of experience in the food and tobacco business, analysts 
praised the 47-year-old Harvard MBA as a smart choice for RJR. "He is 
considered one of the best managers in the business in America today," said 
analyst Brenda Davis McCoy, who covers the financial services industry for 
PaineWebber. "He knows the consumer markets very well and knows how to analyze 
consumer tastes." 
</P>
<P>
Henry R. Kravis, a founding partner of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., said 
in a prepared statement that Gerstner "has widely acknowledged talents for 
developing a comprehensive business strategy and creating a dynamic, 
entrepreneurial culture in a large organization." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say Gerstner, who reportedly will make at least $2.3 million during 
his first year at RJR, will have to move fast to deal with the trauma caused by 
the recent KKR takeover. KKR has made it known that certain parts of the 
company will be sold off "and this creates a tremendous amount of morale 
problems," said analyst Roy D. Burry, at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. "He has to 
talk to people and may have to act rather quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Along with working on the sale of some divisions, Gerstner is expected to 
quickly begin reviewing the company's marketing and spending plans. One analyst 
predicted that Gerstner would have "complete autonomy" to deal with marketing 
and operational matters. 
</P>
<P>
Gerstner, who will join RJR on April 3, said in a news release: "The great 
strengths of the company are its people, its brand loyalties, its consumer 
franchises and its strong market positions. Together, the people of RJR Nabisco 
and I will work to further improve the company, grow it, and make it a creative 
and exciting place to work." 
</P>
<P>
Gerstner, who met Monday with RJR executives in the company's Atlanta 
headquarters, was not available for further comment. A company spokeswoman said 
Gerstner was expected to meet with top managers at the company's divisions in 
the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
For American Express, analysts said, the departure may pose some short-term 
problems but will not be a major blow. 
</P>
<P>
"They are going to keep growing," said analyst Perrin Long at Lipper Analytical 
Services. "But his insights and managerial skills will be missed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Robinson to Step In 
</P>
<P>
American Express officials said that Gerstner's duties will be assumed by 
Chairman James D. Robinson III. Aldo Papone, president of the firm's Travel and 
Related Services division, will assume Gerstner's title as chairman of that 
division. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say they expect the company to eventually name a new president. 
"Whoever takes his place will have an impact on the future strategic direction 
of the company," said Davis McCoy. 
</P>
<P>
Some took the news as an omen for American Express, which owns IDS and 62% of 
Shearson Lehman Bros. At Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., analyst Alison Deans 
lowered her rating on American Express' stock after news of the Gerstner's 
departure. 
</P>
<P>
Word of Gerstner's appointment surprised many industry analysts and even board 
members at American Express. "I didn't know it was coming and I don't think 
anybody knew it was coming," said one board member, whose initial reaction to 
the news was, "Jesus Christ!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Too Good to Refuse' 
</P>
<P>
On Friday morning, Gerstner told American Express' Robinson that he had been 
made an offer and would make up his mind by the end of the day, according to 
company spokesman Lawrence A. Armour. Later that day, he told Robinson he had 
decided to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"Lou left the house in very good order," said Armour. "But the offer was too 
good to refuse." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it was Robinson who had teamed up with Johnson to make the failed 
buyout offer for RJR. 
</P>
<P>
Gerstner, a former consultant with McKinsey &amp; Co., joined American Express 
in 1978 as the head of its American Express Card division. His marketing skills 
and strategies were credited with triggering dramatic increases in sales and 
profits at the once-sluggish division, and his success helped propel him to the 
company's presidency in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
But with little chance for Gerstner to move up to the top job at American 
Express in the near future -- Robinson is not expected to retire for at least 
12 years -- he may have been eager to move elsewhere. "Lou is a very personable 
guy," said Long at Lipper Analytical. "But more than anything else, he is a 
leader more than a follower."

STUDIO CITY FIRM TAPS INTO GROWING MARKET FOR BEST SELLERS ON TAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year ago, Michael A. Viner read "A Brief History of Time," a recent book 
about the universe by Cambridge scientist Stephen W. Hawking. And where Hawking 
saw stars, Viner heard the sound of money. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was going to be a big hit, no one else did," Viner recalled. The 
hard-cover version of Hawking's book was published by Bantam Books, but Viner's 
Studio City company, Dove Books on Tape, stepped in front of Bantam and other 
publishers and bought the audio rights to record the book on audiocassette 
tapes for a $2,000 advance. 
</P>
<P>
A month later, Viner had a six-hour, four-volume tape version of Hawking's book 
for sale -- retail price $24.95 -- in bookstores nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Viner's hunch paid off. Hawking's book was one of the most popular nonfiction 
books of 1988, and has spent the past nine months on The Times' best-seller 
list. As for Dove, it's sold 40,000 copies of the tape version of the book, 
making it Dove's biggest seller since Viner started the company four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Picking Winners 
</P>
<P>
Most of Dove's success, in fact, rides on Viner's sixth sense about what new 
books will be big sellers and popular with the burgeoning audio-book market, 
while moving nimbly to get the rights to those books. 
</P>
<P>
Dove, which is two-thirds owned by Viner, also banks on its ties with some 
well-known authors, including Viner's close friend, best-selling fiction writer 
Sidney Sheldon ("Master of the Game," "The Sands of Time") to supply raw 
material for its tapes. Sheldon also likes the books-on-tape idea and is a part 
owner of Dove. 
</P>
<P>
The market for books on tape is now roughly $100 million and growing by 25% to 
50% a year, industry executives estimate. Although a limited number of audio 
books had been around for years, sales began surging in 1985 after Dove and the 
major book publishers jumped into the market to take advantage of the 300 
million audiocassette players Americans own. 
</P>
<P>
Dove's sales this year will hit $4 million to $5 million, nearly double last 
year's $2.5 million, while its unit sales may double to 600,000 taped books, 
Viner said. 
</P>
<P>
The company, with 17 employees, has a catalogue of 140 taped books for sale 
that it's produced and has about 30 more in production. The eclectic author 
list ranges from Howard Cosell to Charles Dickens. Dove also distributes an 
additional 50 to 60 titles that were produced by other companies. 
</P>
<P>
It helps that Viner, 45, who also is a movie and TV producer (Sheldon's 
"Windmills of the Gods" for TV), has close ties to the entertainment world. For 
the past 14 years, he's been married to actress Deborah Raffin ("Death Wish 
3"), who has also narrated and produced some of the tapes. Viner's Hollywood 
links have helped attract such stars as Roger Moore and Roddy McDowall to 
narrate Dove's books for a modest $2,000 fee, plus royalties. He contends that 
Dove stands apart from the competition by using higher quality tapes and 
production. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tough Competitor 
</P>
<P>
Dove's rivals naturally disagree that Dove's tapes are superior, but Dove looks 
for any edge it can find. The audio-book market has several competitors, 
notably publishing giants Simon &amp; Schuster, a unit of Gulf &amp; Western, 
and Random House, a subsidiary of Affiliated Publications. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Roth, vice president of Simon &amp; Schuster's audio division, claimed 
that his company and Random House are the biggest players in audio, while Dove 
is among the largest independent competitors. For Dove, Simon &amp; Schuster 
and Random House are formidable foes simply because of the huge marketing clout 
they already have with bookstore chains. 
</P>
<P>
"Our ability to cross-promote our audiocassettes with the hardcover division or 
the paperback division is a considerable advantage," Roth said. "That's very 
appealing to an author. Your product comes into one house and is marketed 
successfully in three different venues." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Simon &amp; Schuster and Random House also distribute some of their 
audio books through Dove to reach a wider audience. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Audience on Wheels 
</P>
<P>
Much of that audience listens to books in their cars. "Americans drive over 2 
billion miles a year," and 70% of U.S.-made cars are now sold with cassette 
players, Roth said. When stuck in a traffic jam, drivers can forgo the news and 
listen to Joan Rivers reading her autobiography, "Enter Talking," or Terry 
Southern reading his book "The Magic Christian." 
</P>
<P>
The major bookstores, such as Waldenbooks and B. Dalton/ Barnes &amp; Noble, 
have racks devoted to audio books. Most of the books are condensed to fit on 
two 90-minute cassettes, which are sold in one package that retails between 
$9.95 and $14.95. 
</P>
<P>
Taping a book can certainly add to an author's bank account, although it pales 
compared to possible six-figure paperback rights. A best seller on tape can 
earn an author such as Hawking or Sheldon an extra $30,000, but the payoff more 
often is $5,000 to $15,000, Viner said. 
</P>
<P>
But getting the books out to the public on tape involves lots of production and 
financial steps. 
</P>
<P>
Once Viner or one of his staff has selected a book for tape, Dove must purchase 
the audio rights. 
</P>
<P>
"Publishing houses have about three-quarters of the rights themselves," Viner 
said, while the most popular authors have kept the oral rights to their works. 
"The Sidney Sheldons, the Tom Clancys, etc., will be selling them through their 
own agents," Viner said. 
</P>
<P>
To land the rights, Dove must pay an advance and a royalty on sales. The 
advance can range as high as $10,000, with royalties typically at 10% of the 
tape's wholesale sales for a veteran author. Viner said the average wholesale 
price for a twin-cassette book is about $7.50, so an author might pick up 75 
cents per copy. A big-name author, though, can command up to 10% of the tape's 
retail price in royalties, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Dove has used many celebrity readers, such as Academy Award winners 
Paul Scofield and Julie Andrews, sometimes it signs the book's author. Most 
readers, Viner said, need several hours to compensate for pronunciation errors 
and other mistakes. One exception was sportscaster Howard Cosell, who read a 
three-hour version of his own book, "I Never Played the Game," in three hours 
and 6 minutes. Viner said Cosell "made seven mistakes in the whole tape and 
updated his book while he read. It was the most phenomenal reading I have ever 
seen." 
</P>
<P>
After the master tape is produced, Dove sends the tape out to be mass-produced 
and distributed to the bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Costs, Profit 
</P>
<P>
So the $7.50 average wholesale price of a Dove tape probably would include 75 
cents to the author, 20 cents to the reader, and $4.50 in production, 
advertising and overhead costs, Viner said, leaving him about $2.05 in gross 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
But Viner said some of Dove's top bookstore customers get a hefty discount on 
the price for big orders, so that the $7.50-per-tape average -- and Dove's 
profit -- is actually less. Bottom line: Dove tries to earn an average pretax 
profit of $1.50 per tape.

Asian nations are likely to see their hectic export expansion slow this year 
because of weaker world economic growth, a United Nations panel said. 
</P>
<P>
"In most (Asian) countries, export expansion slowed down in the latter part of 
1988 and this deceleration was expected to continue in 1989 and into 1990," the 
U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific said in its 1988 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
Rapid growth in Japanese demand and expanding trade among developing Asian 
economies boosted the region's exports last year, the Bangkok-based body said. 
China, Hong Kong, Pakistan, South Korea, Singapore and Thailand all saw the 
value of their exports rise by about 20% or more. 
</P>
<P>
But export growth in the region will fall this year because of the expected 
slowdown of the world economy, the report found. Also, Taiwan and South Korea's 
currencies are appreciating and Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand face labor 
shortages.

The Irish Futures and Options Exchange, Dublin's first new financial market in 
almost 200 years, will begin a dummy run Wednesday to prepare for going live in 
mid-April, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The exchange, or IFOX, has decided to reject the "open outcry" systems favored 
in London and Chicago and will instead use an automated trading system for its 
23 members. 
</P>
<P>
All the exchange's seats, priced at $90,000 (60,000 punts) each, have been 
sold, mainly to leading Irish institutions such as Allied Irish Banks and the 
Bank of Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
Trading will begin in three futures contracts -- 20-year Irish government 
bonds, an interest rate future based on the three-month Dublin interbank-rate 
and a future based on the Irish punt/dollar rate. IFOX will be Ireland's first 
new exchange since the Dublin Stock Market was founded in 1799.

BANOWSKY WILL PAY $750,000 IN STOCK TIP CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A leading Los Angeles businessman and educator confirmed Monday that he has 
agreed to settle civil charges for initiating widespread insider trading in the 
stock of Thrifty Corp. in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
William S. Banowsky, a former president of Pepperdine University and one-time 
Republican prospect for governor, said he will pay $750,000 in fines and 
penalties to the Securities and Exchange Commission under the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement, which is expected to be finalized and made public soon, is the 
result of a nearly three-year investigation by the SEC regional office in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Didn't Buy Stock Himself 
</P>
<P>
Banowsky, 53, who is also a former president of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of 
Commerce and two-time president of the University of Oklahoma, did not buy 
Thrifty stock himself and did not profit personally, according to Banowsky's 
lawyer, James W. Mercer. 
</P>
<P>
But, while serving on Thrifty's board of directors, he violated securities laws 
by disclosing confidential information related to the pending acquisition to 
several people, including relatives, said two sources close to the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The people he told informed others, and a total of 18 traded on the 
information. They made $450,000 in profits by purchasing Thrifty stock during 
the week before its acquisition was announced and the price of the shares rose, 
according to the sources who spoke on the condition that their names be 
withheld. 
</P>
<P>
The relatives informed by Banowsky "just killed this guy. They told everybody," 
said one person close to the investigation. "He figured they'd buy a few shares 
for themselves and that would be it." 
</P>
<P>
Another source said that Banowsky was shocked by the extensive trading touched 
off by his disclosure and that he has cooperated fully with the SEC 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement ends the SEC's investigation into all trading related to 
Banowsky's disclosure, and no criminal charges will be filed, said one of the 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
However, the SEC and the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles are conducting a 
further investigation into other insider trading in Thrifty stock during the 
same period, according to two sources. 
</P>
<P>
Banowsky was a board member of the Los Angeles-based drugstore and sporting 
goods chain in May, 1986, when it was acquired by Pacific Lighting, the parent 
of Southern California Gas. The company is now called Pacific Enterprises, and 
Thrifty is a wholly owned subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said Banowsky tipped off his relatives and friends after learning 
that a special meeting of the company's board of directors was likely to be 
called. Other directors at the time said in interviews that they had been 
cautioned to keep the upcoming meeting secret. 
</P>
<P>
The relatives and others who profited are contributing their trading profits to 
the settlement cost, one source said. 
</P>
<P>
Irving M. Einhorn, the SEC administrator here, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Banowsky is executive vice president of National Medical Enterprises, a 
nationwide health-care company based in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In response to Times inquiries, he said Monday: "Three years ago in the space 
of a single hour I made a mistake in judgment. It has caused a lot of grief for 
me and others. I sincerely regret it. I have cooperated fully with the SEC 
staff to resolve it. I am hoping that this gets it behind me." 
</P>
<P>
He declined to elaborate or identify to whom he passed the inside information. 
</P>
<P>
The case is similar to the last big insider trading case brought by the SEC in 
Los Angeles. In a civil lawsuit filed last April, Carl N. Karcher, chairman and 
founder of the Carl's Jr. hamburger chain, and 14 members of his family were 
accused of insider trading in the company's stock. 
</P>
<P>
Six defendants in the civil lawsuit against the Karchers agreed last month to 
pay fines and penalties to settle the case. A seventh was found guilty of 
insider trading in a civil case. Criminal charges of insider trading were filed 
last month against Alvin A. DeShano, the accounting director for the chain and 
the only non-family member involved. He has pleaded innocent. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC office here has limited resources and is unable to bring a large number 
of insider trading cases. As a result, officials have said in the past, the 
office tries to target cases likely to attract publicity in order to achieve 
the greatest deterrence possible. 
</P>
<P>
Banowsky, a native of Abilene, Tex., has been a prominent figure in Los Angeles 
since he became president of Pepperdine in 1971 at age 35. 
</P>
<P>
During seven years in the post, the Church of Christ preacher raised $40 
million for the expansion of the university to its present campus in Malibu and 
was widely hailed for improving its academic standing. 
</P>
<P>
He also became active in conservative Republican politics, serving as a 
fund-raiser for Ronald Reagan when he was governor of California. Reagan 
appointed Banowsky Republican national committeeman. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, Banowsky was considered briefly as a Republican candidate to replace 
Reagan. He also was a prospect for the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, he became president of the University of Oklahoma. He left that post 
in 1982 to become president of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, but 
resigned after six weeks and returned to the University of Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, he became president of Gaylord Broadcasting Co. in Dallas and later 
served as head of the Texas effort to win a $5-billion federal atom-smasher 
project. In October, 1988, he joined National Medical Enterprises as an 
executive vice president. He had been an outside director of the health-care 
giant since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Banowsky was an outside director of Thrifty in May, 1986, when the company was 
approached about a friendly takeover by Pacific Lighting. The deal was 
negotiated in two weeks of highly secret meetings between executives of the two 
companies, but it required approval by the boards of both. 
</P>
<P>
Thrifty's board was not told of the talks. However, on May 21, Banowsky was 
informed by the company's chairman that he might have to attend a special board 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
According to his SEC agreement, Banowsky suggested to several people, including 
some of his relatives, that they consider buying Thrifty stock. 
</P>
<P>
One of the sources said Banowsky was in Washington when he was alerted about 
the possibility of a board meeting, and he disclosed the confidential 
information in several telephone calls to friends and relatives in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Mercer, Banowsky's lawyer, said his client did not know the specific purpose of 
the meeting, but there had been rumors of a possible Thrifty merger. The deal 
was announced on May 28. 
</P>
<P>
While Banowsky did not buy any stock or make any money, securities laws make 
him liable for profits earned on all trades based on information he provided 
illegally. The $750,000 represents profits of $450,000 earned by others on the 
trades, plus penalties and fines. The money is coming from Banowsky as well as 
the people who made the trades, according to one source.

CYANIDE TRACES LEAD U.S. TO SEIZE ALL CHILEAN FRUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In an action that may virtually eliminate peaches, plums, nectarines and red 
seedless grapes from grocery shelves across the country, the federal government 
announced Monday that it is impounding all fruit imports from Chile after 
traces of cyanide were found in a shipment of Chilean grapes. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials do not yet know how long the impoundment may last but 
warned that it could be for the remainder of the Chilean growing season, about 
five weeks. Chile is the nation's leading supplier of winter non-citrus fruit 
and virtually the sole supplier of soft "tree fruits" such as peaches and 
plums. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-area grocers began to remove Chilean grapes from their shelves 
Monday night and were awaiting further word from the Food and Drug 
Administration on what other steps to take, said Jan de Lyser of the Fresh 
Produce Council in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been some action already," De Lyser said. "Whatever they direct will 
be complied with." 
</P>
<P>
Vickie Sanders, a spokeswoman for Vons stores, said the chain had not yet been 
officially informed of the FDA order but had made an "internal decision" to 
remove red seedless grapes from Chile from its shelves. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're trying to do now is prevent people from panicking," Sanders said. 
"People see the word 'cyanide' and they may not notice that it's two grapes out 
of a shipment of 300,000." 
</P>
<P>
FDA officials stressed that, so far, there is no evidence of further 
contamination beyond the one shipment of grapes that entered the country in 
Philadelphia a few days ago. 
</P>
<P>
They noted also that, because cyanide is a quick-acting poison, consumers have 
no reason to worry about fruit they may already have eaten. 
</P>
<P>
Two grapes in the shipment were found to have a low level of cyanide. The 
finding "may be an isolated incident," FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young said. 
"But we can hardly take that chance." 
</P>
<P>
The FDA is advising grocers to remove Chilean fruit from their shelves. It is 
also asking consumers to check the source of any fresh non-citrus fruit they 
have at home and to discard any that may be of Chilean origin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Store Removes Fruit 
</P>
<P>
At a Ralphs market at Third Street and Vermont Avenue, stock clerks had removed 
grapes, blueberries and black plums from the shelves Monday afternoon, said 
store manager Carl Qudaimat. 
</P>
<P>
"We pulled all the questionable things off as a precautionary measure," he 
said. "It's all sitting in the back." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis Stone, a consultant to Agriculture Export-Import USA, a downtown Los 
Angeles fruit and vegetable broker, said there are few alternative sources for 
the inexpensive and plentiful Chilean peaches, apricots, nectarines and plums 
that fill U.S. shelves during the winter. 
</P>
<P>
Although Chilean fruit retails from about $1.50 per pound, alternatives like 
New Zealand fruit can sell for as much $5 per pound, Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to affect the whole industry. The losses will be in the millions of 
dollars," Stone predicted. "Fortunately, we didn't have any (Chilean fruit) in 
the current shipment." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
California Crop in May 
</P>
<P>
Stone predicted that most shoppers and retailers would wait to find substitutes 
for the Chilean fruit until May, when "early" California fruit would begin to 
be available. 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers roaming the aisles of the produce section at a Vons in the 
Mid-Wilshire District reacted calmly to the news that some grapes and other 
non-citrus fruits had been pulled. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't seem to me like something to be concerned about," said Maurice 
Smith as he walked out with a bag of strawberries and bananas, joking that it 
was "safe fruit." 
</P>
<P>
The FDA began checking Chilean imports earlier this month after an anonymous 
caller warned the U.S. Embassy in Chile that fruits being exported from that 
country had been poisoned. From March 2, when the call was made, until March 6, 
Chilean fruit was held up at entry ports by federal officials; but no sign of 
poison was found, so importing was resumed. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, FDA spokesman Bill Grigg said, "the State Department advised us 
that the call was very probably a hoax." But, after cyanide in the grape 
shipment was confirmed Sunday night, officials took the situation seriously. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of cyanide found in the two grapes was too little to cause illness 
even in a child, Grigg noted. The grapes each contained .003 milligrams of the 
poison. A dose of 25 milligrams is needed to harm an adult, with 200 milligrams 
enough to cause death. Injury to children can be caused at lower doses, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
Because cyanide deteriorates over time, FDA scientists warned that the original 
level of poison in the fruit may have been higher. The amount of poison, Grigg 
noted, could be higher in larger fruits, such as melons, or in less acidic 
fruits, because acidity causes the poison to break down more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
The two grapes found to be contaminated were both punctured and discolored with 
a ring of a crystalline material around the puncture mark, Grigg said. FDA 
inspectors spotted them among thousands of grapes in hundreds of crates in a 
Philadelphia warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
"If they had been turned the other way, they wouldn't have seen them," Grigg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA plans to impound and test Chilean fruit until officials are confident 
that the fruit is safe, Grigg said. But, because that essentially means having 
to prove a negative -- that there is no poison anywhere in the tons of fruit 
entering the country from Chile -- the effect may be to block all Chilean 
imports for the rest of this season, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a difficult thing to prove," Grigg said. "We really don't have a lot of 
experience in this area." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of (fruit) will sit out on the boats" while FDA laboratories sample and 
analyze it, Grigg said. 
</P>
<P>
The ban could represent a dramatic financial blow to the Chilean economy. Fruit 
exports have soared since the early 1980s, reaching $486.9 million in the first 
six months of 1988, which include the bulk of the growing season, and a total 
of $584.1 million for the entire year. 
</P>
<P>
Table grapes are by far Chile's most important fruit export, accounting for 
$280.8 million, followed by apples at $104.2 million, according to the Central 
Bank of Chile. 
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Carlos Caceres said early today that thousands of Chilean 
families will be hurt by the ban. 
</P>
<P>
In an indication of the government's concern over the matter, all television 
and radio stations were required to broadcast Caceres' remarks shortly after 
midnight. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Americans themselves had said that the amounts of cyanide 
discovered would not be enough to injure even a child, and said the Chilean 
government does not share the U.S. decision to impound the fruit "but 
understands the concern over their population's health." 
</P>
<P>
Caceres said the government immediately reinforced security throughout the 
fruit production process, from the growing fields to the ports. He said a 
number of chemical tests had been conducted in recent hours and no 
abnormalities were discovered. 
</P>
<P>
For the last several weeks, the major import from Chile has been the popular 
seedless red flame grapes. But, with grape season nearly over, the focus will 
shift to tree fruits such as peaches, plums and nectarines. 
</P>
<P>
The next traditional source of supply for many of those varieties is 
California's Coachella Valley, where harvests will not begin coming in until 
May, De Lyser said. 
</P>
<P>
Staff writers John H. Lee and Hector Tobar in Los Angeles, and James F. Smith 
in Santiago, Chile, contributed to this story.

MORE SCHOOLS BAN APPLES IN CONCERN OVER CHEMICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL and ELAINE WOO, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials of school districts around the state, including San Francisco and 
Sacramento, said Monday that they have pulled apples and apple products from 
their lunch menus because of spreading concerns over children ingesting 
daminozide, a chemical some growers use to treat the fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's announcements followed earlier apple bans by the nation's two largest 
districts -- Los Angeles Unified and New York City schools. 
</P>
<P>
Other districts reporting Monday that they have banned the fruit include 
Compton Unified, which took apples off the menu Friday, and Charter Oak School 
District, serving Covina and Glendora, which eliminated apples from school 
lunches two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the districts have said they suspended serving the fruit pending 
results, expected perhaps as early as today, from the state Department of 
Health Services, which is testing apple products used in schools for the 
presence of daminozide. 
</P>
<P>
The chemical, suspected of causing cancer, is used to slow the ripening of 
apples and improve their appearance. It is produced by Uniroyal Chemical Co. 
and marketed mainly under the brand name Alar. 
</P>
<P>
State and federal officials have been meeting virtually nonstop since last week 
to make a determination of Alar's health risks. Ken Kizer, director of the 
state Department of Health Services, is scheduled to report his staff's finding 
at a Los Angeles press conference today. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Farrar, director of food services for the San Francisco Unified School 
District, said, "We thought it prudent to follow the Los Angeles school 
district's example." Apples already purchased will be stored until test results 
are known. 
</P>
<P>
Delois McDuffie, director of food services for the Sacramento City Unified 
School District, said, "Today we took apples and apple products off the menu as 
a precautionary measure." 
</P>
<P>
McDuffie said the district will reconsider the ban after government tests are 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
New York City schools serve nearly one million students. Los Angeles Unified is 
next with nearly 600,000. San Francisco City schools have more than 60,000 
students; Sacramento City Unified has 45,000. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, farmers, importers, retailers, food processors and bakers are 
concerned about the effect of the schools' banning all apples, even though the 
chemical now is used on less than 5% of the nation's apple crop. 
</P>
<P>
Many supermarkets and other retailers have stopped selling apple products 
containing Alar. Major supermarket chains such as Vons, Lucky, Ralphs and 
Safeway have posted signs in their stores informing customers that they have 
ordered suppliers to certify that apples are not treated with Alar. 
</P>
<P>
Pediatricians have offered conflicting advice. Some recommend that parents stop 
buying apples, while others say they believe that apples are safe. 
</P>
<P>
So far, there has been no evidence of the boycott spreading beyond schools to 
businesses and other groups. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the school districts' actions, state Supt. of Public Instruction Bill 
Honig said Monday, "We're taking the situation seriously, (but) there is no 
evidence that it's a problem in California." 
</P>
<P>
Honig said the use of Alar on apples and apple products is "not anywhere near" 
the problem of lead-contaminated drinking fountains in schools. 
</P>
<P>
However, he was not critical of districts that have eliminated apples from 
school vending machines and lunch menus. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand that districts are caught in the middle. . . . And with Los 
Angeles (Unified) doing it (banning apples), it makes it tougher for other 
districts" to keep serving the fruit, Honig said. 
</P>
<P>
At Carpenter Avenue School in Los Angeles on Monday, cafeteria manager Eleanor 
Muscarella awaited the arrival of a district truck to pick up 2 1/2 boxes, or 
about 450 apples, caught in last week's ban. 
</P>
<P>
The action was defended by Los Angeles School Board member Julie Korenstein, 
who heads a board committee that oversees district food services. There is "no 
question" that the district's decision to stop serving fresh apples and apple 
products was warranted, Korenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot take any chances," she said. "There is no question that we will stop 
purchasing (apples) until we have the answer that they are not a danger to our 
children." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles district is offering oranges, pears and tangerines instead of 
apples. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lunches Without Apples 
</P>
<P>
Some Carpenter students who were interviewed Monday said they would miss apples 
in their school lunches. Several students, such as fifth-grader Neda Partori, 
said their parents already have stopped packing the fruit in their lunches. 
</P>
<P>
But others said they were glad to be rid of apples. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate 'em," said Kathy Faustino, 9, as she peeled the bright orange tangerine 
that came with the hot dog, french fries and chocolate milk served in the 
school cafeteria Monday. 
</P>
<P>
There has been confusion surrounding Alar since the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency said nearly four years ago that it would recommend banning 
use of the chemical on food but later backed off and said it is reviewing test 
data on the chemical. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council issued a report 
saying that children, with lower body weight, are particularly at risk from 
Alar. 
</P>
<P>
A broadcast on CBS-TV's "60 Minutes," summarizing the council's findings, 
helped fuel concern over Alar. Children eat proportionately more apples and 
apple products than do the adults on whom the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
and EPA determined maximum allowable limits -- 20 parts per million. 
</P>
<P>
Despite actions by a growing number of school districts, officials at several 
districts have said they are confident that their apples and apple products are 
free of Alar. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach school administrators said, for example, that they have been assured 
by suppliers that their apples contain no Alar.

WILSON SUPPORTS PARTY TICKETS ON BALLOTS IN STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, Times Political Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, a Republican gubernatorial candidate, said Monday he 
would support changing the California Constitution to require that the governor 
and lieutenant governor be elected as a ticket from the same party. 
</P>
<P>
But Wilson conveyed that his month-old candidacy is not far enough along for 
him to be precise about terms of such a change in election law -- or for him to 
speak authoritatively on other matters that are likely to be contested in the 
1990 campaign, issues as commonplace as gun control or as complex as today's 
growth of governance by ballot initiative. 
</P>
<P>
The senator was reelected in November to a second six-year term, and then in 
February declared he would run for governor next year. An hourlong breakfast 
session Monday was his first long question-and-answer session with journalists 
since entering the gubernatorial race. 
</P>
<P>
Relaxed and seeming in good humor, Wilson chose to stay out of the line of 
fire, even if doing so meant raising questions about his rationale for seeking 
to govern the state. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Split Tickets 
</P>
<P>
He came closest to specifics on the matter of a governor-lieutenant governor 
ticket. In the last three gubernatorial election years -- 1978, '82 and '86 -- 
voters chose a governor and lieutenant governor from different parties. Wilson 
said some voters enjoy this ticket-splitting as fun and as a grass-roots check 
on the power of politicians. 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "we have created . . . quite enough in the way of checks and 
balances" in government already. 
</P>
<P>
"You hear a great deal about leadership, about wanting effective leadership. . 
. . I think the state would do well to emulate the federal system, certainly in 
having the governor and lieutenant governor run as a team, as a ticket," Wilson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The federal system, of course, allows a presidential nominee to select a 
running mate with approval of the party's political nominating convention. 
Wilson said he would be happy with that opportunity, or, in the alternative, to 
run as a ticket with the winner of his party's primary election for lieutenant 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
A proposed constitutional amendment calling for a new ticket system of electing 
the governor and lieutenant governor is pending in the Legislature but faces an 
uphill battle. In one statewide public opinion poll, Californians said they 
favor leaving the current system intact. 
</P>
<P>
So does incumbent Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, a Democrat who has announced he 
will run for reelection in 1990. Supporters of change hope to break through the 
opposition and put the question on the June, 1990, ballot so that it could 
affect the November general election. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Ready for Battle 
</P>
<P>
On other subjects, in question after question, the senator indicated he was not 
ready for battle. 
</P>
<P>
He said he probably would sign a ban on sales of assault rifles as proposed in 
the state Assembly, a ban that would specify by make and model each unlawful 
weapon. But then again, he added, maybe there is validity to arguments that 
rural Californians, far from police, need AK-47s or Uzis for personal 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said he shares the concern of rank-and-file voters that too much law is 
the result of ballot initiatives. But the senator indicated at the same time 
that he is interested in two or perhaps more initiative campaigns now being 
discussed in GOP circles. 
</P>
<P>
One being considered in various forms would strip from the Legislature the 
power to redraw legislative and congressional district boundaries to adjust for 
population change. Another is an idea to restructure government and eliminate 
the many layers of spending priorities now on the books in order to allow the 
next governor and Legislature more leeway in budgeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very interested -- but what role I take will, using the words of Jerry 
Brown, will evolve," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Names Priorities 
</P>
<P>
His announcement speech Feb. 18 was implicitly critical of the Deukmejian 
Administration -- at least as far as Wilson's willingness to increase GOP 
priorities for environmental protection, methods of alternative transportation, 
health care for the elderly, and research into cures for AIDS, Alzheimer's 
disease and breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
But Monday, Wilson chose instead to emphasize points of similarity. He said 
Californians could look forward to continuity between Wilson and Deukmejian on 
"fiscal stewardship" and in handling "the problems of crime and drug abuse." 
</P>
<P>
Asked how his governorship might make a difference in Sacramento, Wilson 
attacked the partisan nature of today's Capitol politics. "I think the public 
is sick to death of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
What would he do? 
</P>
<P>
"Well in a nonpartisan way I'd try to bring in a Republican majority," he 
cracked, but offered nothing else.

EX-PRESS AIDE BRADY TO HELP THE DISABLED

Former White House Press Secretary James S. Brady, severely wounded eight years 
ago this month during an assassination attempt on former President Ronald 
Reagan, announced Monday that he has accepted an unpaid full-time job as vice 
chairman of the National Organization on Disability. 
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic gesture, Brady -- who uses a wheelchair most of the time -- 
walked with the aid of a cane in slow but steady steps from his wheelchair to a 
seat at the microphone. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bear is back for good now," he said, referring to a nickname he received 
in college "because of the way I look," which was perpetuated by the Washington 
press corps. "And you'll be hearing from me often." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recently Retired 
</P>
<P>
Brady, 48, who recently retired from the federal government on disability, said 
that he has learned first-hand "the frustrations and the cuts and slights" of 
being disabled. 
</P>
<P>
"You vow then to make it better," he said. "That's what I'm going to try to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
The National Organization on Disability, a private, Washington-based group, was 
formed in 1982 to work to expand the participation of the nation's 37 million 
disabled persons in the mainstream of their communities and to enhance public 
understanding of disabled persons. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that I'm one of those 37 million Americans, I know what it's like . . . " 
Brady said. "I want to help the National Organization on Disability sensitize 
non-disabled people to what it's like. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
When asked to describe the kinds of daily frustrations he encounters, Brady 
said: "Like going out for a meal and having no table that my wheelchair fits 
under," adding, with a chuckle, "and having them take the table out and chop it 
up for firewood." 
</P>
<P>
Brady, whose wife, Sarah, has been active in the gun-control movement, was 
asked how he felt about recent efforts to curtail assault weapons. "I'll keep 
my advice in private," he said. "But I don't think you'd have to think hard to 
know what my advice would be to our new President. Our law enforcement officers 
say they are outgunned in the streets by assault weapons." 
</P>
<P>
Brady suffered a near-fatal head wound on March 30, 1981, when John W. Hinckley 
Jr., attempting to assassinate Reagan, fired several shots at the President as 
he was leaving a Washington hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Brady, accompanying Reagan, was struck by a bullet that touched his brain's 
left frontal lobe before passing into -- and critically damaging -- the right 
frontal lobe. As a result, motor functions on his left side were seriously 
impaired. He cannot use his left arm at all and his left leg is debilitated. 
However, his thinking functions -- his intellect, wit, personality and 
long-term memory -- were largely unaffected. 
</P>
<P>
Brady, who was injured only two months after the beginning of Reagan's first 
term, retained the press secretary's title and salary for Reagan's two terms, 
although he was unable to return to work. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the doctors, in the early days, thought Jim needed it to keep him 
going," Sarah Brady said in a recent interview. "I think Jim was always hoping 
he could go back full time." 
</P>
<P>
She added: "He is capable of filling many positions, but that of White House 
press secretary was just too mentally and physically demanding." 
</P>
<P>
She said that she and Brady had talked to President Bush before the 
inauguration about "Jim's staying on," but Brady declined to accept a paid 
position. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim wants to contribute without feeling like he's on the public dole," she 
said. "He wants to feel his own self-respect by not taking a handout job, even 
though we know that's not what President Bush meant."

HIS PARTY TURNS ITS BACK ON BOTHA; 
</P>
<P>
ENDORSES DE KLERK'S BID TO BE PRESIDENT OF SOUTH AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The top echelon of the ruling white National Party on Monday delivered an 
unprecedented formal rebuke to President Pieter W. Botha, its tough-fisted 
chief for the past decade, by unanimously endorsing new party leader Frederik 
W. de Klerk's bid to become South Africa's president. 
</P>
<P>
The party's executive council and its parliamentary caucus, meeting late into 
the night in Cape Town, turned its back on Botha a day after the 73-year-old 
president defiantly declared that he had fully recovered from a stroke and 
would return to his post for at least another year. 
</P>
<P>
Although the party's decision does not prevent Botha from remaining as 
president and resuming his duties, it creates an untenable situation for him 
since he must have the party's support to make policy and get his programs 
approved in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk telephoned Botha at the president's coastal vacation home to tell him 
the results of the vote, a party spokesman said. The president and the party 
leaders will likely meet to discuss the matter today or Wednesday, after he 
returns to his office in Cape Town for the parliamentary debate on next year's 
budget, a party spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Extend Term 
</P>
<P>
Botha and the party could then reach a compromise about his future that would, 
for example, allow him to serve a few months and then retire. His second 
five-year term expires in September, but theoretically he has the option of 
extending it until March, 1990, by which time Parliament must be dissolved and 
a new general election called. Many party leaders had hoped for an earlier 
election to consolidate National Party support under a new leader. 
</P>
<P>
It was the president himself who inadvertently triggered the crisis in his 
party, which created the system of apartheid and which has led the white 
minority government in this country for the past 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks after suffering a mild stroke on Jan. 18, Botha relinquished his post 
as party leader, and the National Party caucus elected De Klerk, the 
52-year-old education minister, to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
Under South Africa's system of government, which denies the black majority a 
vote in national elections, the ruling party's decision effectively tapped De 
Klerk as the next president. In his first days as party leader, De Klerk 
impressed a broad spectrum of white South Africans with what was seen as a more 
aggressive approach to apartheid reform than the step-by-step program launched 
by Botha. 
</P>
<P>
When Botha, without consulting party leaders, announced in a nationally 
televised interview Sunday night that he would return to office, many party 
members were angry. They considered the TV appearance an attempt to bypass the 
party hierarchy, and De Klerk called a meeting of the party's chief 
policy-making body for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confidence Motion 
</P>
<P>
The resolution adopted by the policy-makers and, later, by the caucus of party 
members in Parliament, declared that it was "in the best interest of the 
country and the National Party that the national leader of the party should 
fill the office of state president." Then, a motion of full confidence in De 
Klerk as leader of the party also was passed unanimously. 
</P>
<P>
For Botha, an aloof, imperious man who commanded total loyalty during his years 
in power, the party's action indicated just how sharply his support had 
dwindled during his eight weeks' convalescence. As the longest-serving member 
of Parliament, marking his 41st year in the body, Botha had come to dominate 
his party. He had been known to scold members of his Cabinet in public for 
disagreeing with him, and his temper was legendary. 
</P>
<P>
Although party leaders had quietly expressed their hope that Botha would step 
aside for the younger, more flexible De Klerk, few party regulars had dared go 
public with their desires on the chance that Botha would return and, as he has 
so many times in the past, take revenge by destroying them politically. 
</P>
<P>
In the interview with state-run television Sunday night, his first public 
appearance since his stroke, Botha denied that he was "an old man clinging to 
power," as government-supporting newspapers had begun to characterize him. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had split the jobs of president and party leader to devote more time 
to his duties of head of state. And he dismissed newspaper reports that the 
party wanted him to retire, suggesting that those stories were the work of 
forces trying to "sow political confusion" in the country.

ISRAELI TROOPS' WEST BANK UNDERCOVER ROLE TOLD;

SOLDIERS REPORTEDLY DON ARAB DISGUISE FOR AMBUSHES, ARRESTS, OTHER MISSIONS

EIZARIYA, Israeli-Occupied West Bank 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Israeli army troops posing as Arabs are being sent on missions to ambush, 
arrest or simply provoke rebellious Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip, Israeli and Arab sources say. 
</P>
<P>
The undercover activity, a little-discussed tool of fighting the Arab uprising 
that is now in its 16th month, has been revealed in several ways: through the 
death of Arabs in unusual or mysterious circumstances, through botched 
operations in which the disguised soldiers have been endangered or from 
eyewitness reports. 
</P>
<P>
In at least one case, the Israel Defense Forces confirmed the use of soldiers 
out of uniform. Questioned in general about missions using disguised soldiers, 
military spokeswoman Ofra Preuss remarked: "We have many ways of fighting the 
uprising. Sometimes we have to penetrate the ranks of the terrorists to catch 
the stone-throwers and the leaders." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Setting Up Roadblock 
</P>
<P>
In the case in question, in late February, two out-of-uniform soldiers fatally 
shot a Palestinian in the West Bank village of Eizariya, just a few miles east 
of Jerusalem. The villager had accosted them as they were setting up a 
roadblock in an alleyway. 
</P>
<P>
The pair had wrapped traditional checkered Arab kaffiyehs, or cloth 
headdresses, around their faces, witnesses said. On previous occasions, such 
masqueraders had been seen throwing stones at Arab houses along the highway to 
Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
On this occasion, when the Palestinian, Mohammed Said Rishik, ripped a kaffiyeh 
off one of the men, a fistfight erupted, and one of the disguised agents opened 
fire with a pistol, hitting Rishik with a bullet near the heart, Arab neighbors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Both armed men then chased three of Rishik's sons into a nearby drugstore. The 
boys hid in a corner of a small bathroom while one pursuer fired through the 
door. The back wall of the bathroom is pockmarked with at least four bullet 
holes. The door of Rishik's house is also scarred with four marks from bullets. 
</P>
<P>
Rishik, 57, a father of 13, lay dying on the road. Arabs say that a car with 
Jewish license plates stopped and that the driver offered to take the man to a 
hospital but was shooed away by the undercover soldiers. A car with blue 
license plates, the color assigned to West Bank Arabs, stopped and took Rishik 
to Mokassed Hospital in Jerusalem. He died on the way. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers who manned a rooftop outpost within view of the proceedings intervened 
only after the two men in kaffiyehs had fled. The uniformed soldiers arrested 
the three youths who were cowering in the bathroom, later releasing them. 
</P>
<P>
At first, army spokesmen were quoted in press reports as saying the shooting 
may have been a mistake. Afterward, the army confirmed the activity of the 
undercover operatives but denied that there was anything untoward about the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
Preuss, the army spokeswoman, said the victim had stabbed one of the undercover 
agents in the hand, inviting retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
"If this happened anywhere, say New York, the target of the stabbing would have 
the right to open fire," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing Legality 
</P>
<P>
The use of soldiers in civilian dress raises tangled questions about the 
purpose of Israeli troops in the occupied lands and how the soldiers are 
controlled. Army officials have taken great pains in recent weeks to emphasize 
the legality of all military actions directed at Arabs, including the tearing 
down of homes, detentions without trial, expanded sentences for stone-throwers 
and relaxed rules for firing weapons on Arab protesters and rioters. 
</P>
<P>
The tactic of setting ambushes for stone-throwers or leaders of the uprising 
suggests that judgment and punishment of suspects is sometimes in the hands of 
anonymous commandos. Critics have charged that while such actions may be 
justified under rules governing Israeli security, they hardly fall within norms 
of lawful behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the question of law and the suppression of the uprising, human 
rights lawyer David Kretchmer recently called the government's tests of army 
action in the West Bank and Gaza "formalistic." 
</P>
<P>
"Under military occupation, the people who carry out the law make the law," he 
argued. The major question in rules concerning who can fire on whom and under 
what circumstances is secondary to "what units do in the territories," 
Kretchmer added. 
</P>
<P>
After an unfavorable human rights report from the State Department and growing 
criticism of Israel's handling of the uprising, the Bush Administration is 
urging Israel to reduce tension in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
During talks this week in Washington with Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, 
American officials are expected to ask the Israelis to reopen West Bank 
schools, release Arab prisoners and curb the practice of jailing Arabs without 
trial. Reports here suggest that Israel may make some gestures to meet 
Washington's requests but will not bend on its basic position that the 
intifada, as an assault on Israeli security, must be put down. 
</P>
<P>
Outlines of the undercover work began to take shape last fall when reports 
surfaced of plainclothes units operating both in the West Bank and Gaza. The 
British news agency Reuters reported the existence of two units, code-named 
Cherry and Samson, deployed "as a mobile force using unconventional methods to 
penetrate remote villages before residents raised the alarm." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Blood on Their Hands' 
</P>
<P>
Such units were under orders to catch stone-throwers and shoot to kill 
fugitives "with blood on their hands," the report added, quoting Israeli 
security sources. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government denied, however, that the army had assassinated anyone. 
The military censor lifted the credentials of two Reuters reporters for several 
weeks after publication of the report. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 9, unidentified men shot and killed two Arab activists in the West Bank 
village of Yatta. Palestinian witnesses said the assailants wore checkered 
headdresses, a common Arab fashion, and fired from an unmarked van. The 
Jerusalem weekly magazine Kol Ha-ir reported that witnesses saw the two 
Palestinians being dragged into the van still alive. A shot inside the van was 
heard as the vehicle sped away. 
</P>
<P>
The day before, a Palestinian activist in a village near the West Bank town of 
Tulkarm was shot in the heart at close range. Palestinians said he was hunted 
by undercover agents; the Israeli army said he was the victim of an Arab clan 
feud. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, armed men in civilian dress commandeered an Arab-licensed bus and 
shot and wounded three Palestinian stone-throwers. 
</P>
<P>
One such unit was involved in a violent mix-up in September. An Israeli settler 
on the West Bank whose car was firebombed shot at two men he believed were 
Arabs responsible for the attack. Instead, the men were soldiers in civilian 
dress waiting in ambush on the road, according to Israeli press reports. 
</P>
<P>
Members of such units have also posed as reporters in order to close in on 
protesters and rioters. Last summer, American television crews complained to 
Israeli authorities that agents had masqueraded as TV reporters to arrest an 
Arab suspected of throwing a gasoline bomb at a public bus.

GORBACHEV BLAST AT YELTSIN IN '87 DISPUTE IS TOLD

President Mikhail S. Gorbachev joined with Soviet conservatives to crush former 
Moscow Communist Party chief Boris N. Yeltsin's challenge to his reform 
program, once-secret papers showed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The papers reveal that leading reformers in the Soviet leadership united with 
old-time figures, including Politburo conservative Yegor K. Ligachev, at the 
height of a Kremlin dispute 18 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Gorbachev hailed Ligachev as a dedicated backer of reform and 
attacked Yeltsin, accusing him of putting personal ambition above the party, 
according to a report on a stormy meeting of the party's policy-making Central 
Committee in October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Copies of the report, published in the February edition of Central Committee 
News, circulated among Soviet officials and journalists Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, once identified as closely in tune with Gorbachev's reforming spirit 
and now campaigning for a political comeback as a candidate in new-style Soviet 
elections for a democratized legislature to be held March 26, says reform is 
not going ahead fast enough. 
</P>
<P>
The 1987 meeting followed a speech at the session by Yeltsin arguing that 
Ligachev was acting dictatorially, that too much praise was being heaped on 
Gorbachev and that perestroika -- restructuring -- was lagging.

Thousands of refugees fleeing from fighting around the eastern Afghan city of 
Jalalabad have arrived in Pakistan and as many as 30,000 more are streaming 
toward the border, Afghan rebels said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Mullah Torkhani, a guerrilla who returned to Pakistan from the Jalalabad area 
Monday, said that crowds of old men, children and women clutching babies and 
bundles of possessions are heading toward the Khyber Pass on the frontier. 
</P>
<P>
Drivers are finding it difficult to use the highway, which is mostly controlled 
by the moujahedeen guerrillas, because of refugees on the road, other rebels 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Afghans from in and around Jalalabad have already crossed into 
Pakistan to escape what Kabul government officials have described as the 
heaviest fighting of the 10-year-old war. 
</P>
<P>
The Western-backed rebels launched their assault on Jalalabad a week ago. They 
are eager to capture a major Afghan city to gain credibility for the 
provisional government they chose at a congress in Pakistan last month. 
</P>
<P>
The forces of Afghan President Najibullah's Soviet-backed government responded 
with heavy bombing and shelling and say they halted the rebel advance. Rebel 
sources said that fighting continued Monday but at a much lower level. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said the guerrillas were two to three miles from the city center 
but much closer to the airport, a center of heavy fighting for several days. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the latest refugees are members of families who had supported the 
Soviet-backed government, the rebels said. 
</P>

BLAST SAID TO TRIGGER QUAKE IN E. GERMANY

<P>
An earthquake, possibly triggered by a mine blast, Monday toppled chimneys on 
several people in East Germany and damaged 80% of one town, news reports said. 
</P>
<P>
The official East German news agency said the quake was recorded at a magnitude 
of 5.5 and was centered near the East-West German border. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, U.S. Geological Survey spokesman Don Finley said the epicenter 
was about 25 miles northeast of Fulda, West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The Geological Survey said the quake occurred at 2:02 p.m. and appeared to be 
the largest one ever recorded in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The East German news agency said a number of people were hurt by falling 
chimneys. 
</P>
<P>
The temblor damaged 80% of the buildings in Voelkerhausen, and some residents 
were evacuated to temporary shelters, the news report said. Although the quake 
shook populated areas in West Germany, including Frankfurt, officials reported 
no casualties or damage. The tremor also was registered in the Soviet Union, 
the news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
It said that in the quake area, buildings were damaged, power was cut and a 
number of roads had to be closed. 
</P>
<P>
The news agency said the earthquake was triggered by underground blasting in 
the Ernst Thaelmann salt and potash mine in Bad Salzungen, East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
It said underground miners working near the blast site were evacuated after the 
quake, but it did not specify whether any were injured. 
</P>
<P>
Finley said it was possible an explosion could trigger a quake. 
</P>
<P>
"If an earthquake is about to happen relatively soon, an underground explosion 
could be the last straw to trigger it," Finley said. 
</P>
<P>
Waverly Person, a geophysicist at the Geological Survey station in Golden, 
Colo. which monitors quakes worldwide, said he had heard reports the quake was 
triggered by a "rockburst" -- a sudden release of pressure -- in a potash mine 
and said the quake was "rather large" to have been triggered that way. 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "There is the possibility that could happen. I'm not saying yes 
and I'm not saying no."

HIGH COURT UPSETS MURDER CONVICTION, CITING POLICE FOR 'BLUNDER' WITH SUSPECT 
</P>

<P>
The state Supreme Court, citing a "blunder" by police, on Monday reversed the 
conviction and death sentence of a man found guilty in the frenzied "Halloween 
II" stabbing murders of an elderly Fullerton couple in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The court, in an unusual split, ruled 5 to 2 that Richard Delmer Boyer, 31, of 
El Monte, was entitled to a new trial because police obtained his confession in 
"flagrant violation" of his constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
Justice David N. Eagleson, writing for the majority, called the case a 
"relatively rare but distressing (instance) in which the outcome is determined 
by the constable's blunders." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Flashback' Claim 
</P>
<P>
Boyer was convicted of murder and robbery and sentenced to death in 1984 in the 
killings of Aileen Harbitz, 68, and her husband, Francis, 67. At trial, Boyer 
admitted the slayings but unsuccessfully sought acquittal on grounds that he 
acted in a drug-induced "flashback" to a horror movie graphically depicting 
stranglings, shootings, stabbings and other brutal acts. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's ruling, however, centered on two critical actions by police that the 
court concluded required reversal of Boyer's conviction and sentence. 
</P>
<P>
First, the justices held that Boyer had been taken from his home to police 
headquarters and questioned at length before there was sufficient evidence to 
justify an arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after Boyer called a halt to the questioning by asserting his right to 
silence and legal counsel, police improperly resumed the interrogation in 
violation of his rights under the so-called Miranda rule, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision marked a rare split in a capital case among the five conservative 
court members appointed by Gov. George Deukmejian. Three Deukmejian appointees 
-- Eagleson, Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas and Justice John A. Arguelles -- 
joined with Justices Stanley Mosk and Allen E. Broussard in the majority. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's two other appointees -- Justices Edward A. Panelli and Marcus M. 
Kaufman -- dissented in an opinion by Panelli that strongly criticized the 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Subjective Belief Cited 
</P>
<P>
The defendant, in fact, had been free to refuse to go to police headquarters 
and the majority erred in basing its ruling on his subjective belief that he 
had to accommodate the officers, the dissenters said. 
</P>
<P>
"I am troubled and concerned that the subjective standard used by the majority 
portends a severe limitation, if not elimination, of the voluntary, 
non-custodial police-station interview," Panelli wrote. 
</P>
<P>
State Deputy Atty. Gen. Jay M. Bloom said that he was "somewhat disappointed" 
in Monday's ruling and that prosecutors may seek a rehearing or appeal the 
decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. But Bloom noted that other important 
evidence may still be used against Boyer in any retrial. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the victims had been discovered by the couple's son William 
several days after the killings. Francis Harbitz had been stabbed 24 times, his 
wife 19 times. 
</P>
<P>
Later, William Harbitz made what he called a "long shot" suggestion to 
Fullerton police that Boyer might be the killer because he had done gardening 
work for the couple, owed them money, carried a sheath knife and became violent 
when drunk. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Informed of Rights 
</P>
<P>
Police, admittedly without sufficient proof to arrest, went to Boyer's 
residence and asked him to accompany them to headquarters. At the station, 
Boyer was informed of his rights to silence and free legal counsel, as required 
by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1966 landmark case of Miranda vs. Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
During subsequent questioning, Boyer claimed he was innocent, but Detective 
Richard Lewis, a 20-year veteran of the force, repeatedly asserted that police 
could prove Boyer guilty. 
</P>
<P>
According to testimony in the case, Boyer several times asked if he was under 
arrest, but Lewis evaded the question and continued the interrogation. Finally, 
Boyer said that he didn't "want to talk no more" and that he wanted a lawyer. 
Lewis told him to "sit tight." 
</P>
<P>
Later, the detective summoned Boyer and told him that he did not know whether 
Boyer was telling the truth but that there would be further investigation. 
Then, according to Lewis, as he turned to leave the room to arrange 
transportation home for Boyer, the defendant shouted: "Hey, wait a minute. Come 
back here and sit down. You're right. I can't live with it. I did it. I didn't 
meant to do it. But I did it."

WESTERN COSTUME: PRESERVING FABRIC OF HOLLYWOOD HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When America declared war after the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941, the California 
National Guard was mobilized and called to arms. There was one problem, 
however: caught without warning, the servicemen had nothing to wear. 
</P>
<P>
No cause for alarm. The Western Costume Co. of Hollywood, the vanguard of 
authentic movie costumes, outfitted the soldiers with uniforms before they set 
off to guard the state's bridges and other vital installations. 
</P>
<P>
Western Costume, the film industry's oldest and largest costume maker and 
supplier with an estimated 1.5 million pieces in stock, remains the major 
outfitter for film and television today. Fears among costume designers that it 
might be dismantled ended last week when Paramount Pictures Corp. sold Western 
Costume for an undisclosed price to three private investors who promised to 
keep the company operational. 
</P>
<P>
The six-story, concrete stronghold that houses the costume company looms on an 
85,000-square-foot lot adjacent to and directly east of Paramount Studios on 
Melrose Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"The only reason we bought the company was to get control of the property," 
said Earl Lestz, president of Paramount's Studio Group, which purchased Western 
Costume last April from the four movie studios that shared ownership -- 
Universal, Warner Bros., Fox and Columbia. "Our intention from day one was to 
sell the business." 
</P>
<P>
The property will be used to expand Paramount's operations in a heavily 
congested part of the city where there is limited room for growth, although it 
has not yet been determined exactly what the studio will do with the property. 
Lestz said Paramount could have sold Western Costume sooner, but held out for a 
buyer who would agree to keep the reported $25 million costume collection 
intact and in town. 
</P>
<P>
Western Costume, with 75 employees and an annual revenue estimated last year at 
$5 million, now belongs to AHS Trinity Group, an investment group comprised of 
three shareholders: novelist Sidney Sheldon, television agent Bill Haber and 
businessman Paul Abramowitz. 
</P>
<P>
"Hollywood is being liquidated, sold off piece by piece to the highest bidder," 
said Haber, one of the founding partners of Creative Artists Agency. 
"Everything has been boiled down to finances. I believe strongly in protecting 
the entertainment industry's institutions. We can make money with Western 
Costume, but we also plan to maintain the integrity of the collection." 
</P>
<P>
"We want to build the costume company into what it was," Sheldon agreed. 
"Hollywood has been run down for a long time, and we're trying to put a stop to 
it. We want to preserve it, not sell it off. We're going to make Western 
Costume a tourist attraction and a museum." 
</P>
<P>
The shareholders expect to be out of the present facility in the next six 
months. They are considering new locations in Hollywood and Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Western Costume began simply enough in 1912, when a trader of American Indian 
goods named L. L. Burns wandered into Los Angeles loaded down with Indian 
costumes and tales of the Wild West. 
</P>
<P>
The motion picture industry was in the earliest stages of development when 
Burns chanced to meet William S. Hart, the steely-eyed, solemn-faced hero of 
dozens of silent Westerns. Burns told the cowboy star how flagrantly inaccurate 
the costumes worn by his Indian extras were, at which point Hart invited Burns 
to become the exclusive supplier of Indian clothing for his future pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after, Burns began raiding smaller studios and production companies to 
augment his inventory with a more comprehensive stock. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the major studios maintained their own wardrobe departments, 
Western Costume flourished by continuing to manufacture and stockpile its 
arsenal of costumes. Over the years, the company produced colorful and 
elaborate garb for spectacles such as "King Kong" (1933), Cecille B. DeMille's 
"Cleopatra" (1934), "The Wizard of Oz" (1939), "The King and I" (1956) and 
"Spartacus" (1960). 
</P>
<P>
"Western set the standard for magnificent costumes for the whole industry," 
said Elois Jennsen, Oscar-winning costume designer for "Samson and Delilah" 
(1949) and former president of the Costume Designer's Guild. "I've always felt 
you can do the most beautiful sketch in the world, but it's the cutter and 
fitter and tailor who breathe life into it that makes the difference." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Western Costume boasts that it can fill a 6 p.m. request to provide 
1,000 Indian costumes, complete with headdresses and tomahawks, for a 9 a.m. 
call the next day. 
</P>
<P>
The interior of the company's imposing cement structure is a treasure chest 
filled with rare and exotic fabrics, laces, beads and trim. Factory rooms 
provide a workplace for scores of dressmakers and tailors who daily manufacture 
custom-made costumes, shoes, hats, jewelry and leather goods. 
</P>
<P>
An exhaustive library of more than 12,000 books and magazines is located on the 
premises -- in order to assure the medals that adorn the chest of a Prussian 
general's costume are placed in just the right order, or that the proper silk 
is used in the robe of a 12th-Century Chinese coolie. 
</P>
<P>
But clearly most impressive are the costume racks, endless rows and corridors 
of musty wardrobes and articles of clothing, originals and replicas from every 
period in history, dating back to the dawn of man. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to remember that everything in a movie is visual, and costumes are 
one of the things people see first and remember most," said Abramowitz, 
president of AHS Trinity Group and the new president of Western Costume. "From 
one point of view, this is Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
There are some who feel that Western Costume's luster and glory faded with the 
studio system. The lavish epics of Hollywood's golden age have been largely 
replaced by more moderate, timely films about contemporary society. As a 
result, an increasing number of movie costumes are being bought directly off 
store racks or created by fashion designers such as Nolan Miller, Bob Mackey 
and Bill Hargate. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be (that) every costume that appeared in a movie was custom-made 
for the star, with their name, the studio and the slated production on the 
label," said Bill Thomas, a Los Angeles costumer collector and dealer. "Now all 
I look at are store labels when I acquire wardrobes. Arnold Schwarzenegger's 
futuristic leather jacket in 'The Terminator' was really a store-bought, Bates 
motorcycle jacket. Out of 700 garments I acquire, I'll find maybe five that 
still have studio labels." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas claims to have purchased a number of bargains over the years from 
Western Costume in quietly held "pound" sales, where buyers pay for loads of 
costumes by the pound. A year and a half ago, he landed one of the original 
toreador suits worn by Tyrone Power in "The Mark of Zorro" (1940). 
</P>
<P>
Abramowitz stated firmly that such sales will not be continued under the new 
ownership. The investment group expressed concern over the increasing amount of 
Hollywood history and memorabilia that is being bought by foreign investors and 
shipped overseas. AHS Trinity has already budgeted $1 million to acquire new 
costumes -- including a modern collection -- and refurbish existing stock. 
</P>
<P>
"The reasons our group became involved are simple," Haber said. "I want the 
historical value and research collection to be available to the generations 
that follow me. And I want to show a sign that there are certain important 
institutions in this industry that we should attempt to keep together in 
America."

GETTY EXPERTISE WELCOMED IN LAND OF THE PHARAOHS 
</P>

<P>
If you want to irritate Sayed Tawfik, the new chairman of the Egyptian 
Antiquities Organization, just put on a patronizing face and announce that you 
would like to help his country. 
</P>
<P>
He has little patience with disingenuous foreign archeologists who use his 
country to "help themselves become famous Egyptologists," he said the other day 
in an interview at the Getty Conservation Institute in Marina del Rey. The 
Getty visit was part of Tawfik's first trip to the United States, a three-week 
journey including an appearance at the current "Ramses II" exhibition at the 
Dallas Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
"Archeology began in Egypt with foreigners," Tawfik said, but the country has 
suffered from those who use the field for personal aggrandizement. They dig, 
make discoveries, take pictures, get their names in the newspapers and leave 
without giving much thought -- or help -- to the restoration and maintenance of 
the sites where they have worked. 
</P>
<P>
It takes a certain amount of courage for Tawfik to discriminate among would-be 
helpers. He is responsible for every monument, archeological site and 
antiquities museum in Egypt. He readily admits that he needs assistance with 
his country's incredible cache of cultural history, but he is looking for the 
highest level of international teamwork. 
</P>
<P>
That's what he says he has found at the Getty Conservation Institute, directed 
by Luis Monreal. Functioning primarily as a catalyst, the institute provides 
expertise, training and partial funding for projects and assembles 
international teams of experts to advise local organizations on the 
conservation of their cultural heritage. 
</P>
<P>
Two successful joint projects of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization and the 
Getty Conservation Institute have left Tawfik hoping for more of the right kind 
of help. One is the development of a climate-controlled storage case for 
organic material. The problem was worked out on a 3,000-year-old, 4-foot, 
10-inch mummy who gave her body to research but has suffered no ill effects in 
the process. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed Lady X, the anonymous mummy was shipped in 1987 from Egypt to Marina del 
Rey. Over a period of several months, Getty scientists built and tested a 
prototype air-tight case that preserves organic material in an inert gas 
atmosphere. The idea was to find a simple, inexpensive solution that could be 
adopted by museums around the world. The result is an aluminum-framed glass box 
that is hermetically sealed with O-rings and costs about $1,700. 
</P>
<P>
The cases can be used for storage and display of parchment, leather and wood as 
well as unearthed human remains, which deteriorate from pollution, unstable 
environments and attacks of microorganisms. 
</P>
<P>
Lady X will soon return to the Cairo Museum, along with one of the new cases. 
She will not reside in the special box, however. It is reserved for a more 
important personage, one of 27 royal mummies from the New Kingdom discovered in 
1881. 
</P>
<P>
Tawfik hopes to acquire a complete set of the protective cases for a new 
display of the royal mummies at the Cairo Museum, but it will take time, 
instruction and money. 
</P>
<P>
"Money you can always get," he said, although the Egyptian Antiquities 
Organization is funded largely by tourist revenues and not by the government. 
This year the organization will spend about $8.5 million on restoration. 
</P>
<P>
Expertise is a bigger challenge, Tawfik said. For the mummy project, two of his 
13,000 employees visited the Getty to learn how to build the cases. To deal 
with the long-range problem of training Egyptian conservators, Tawfik has 
established a department of conservation at Cairo University. 
</P>
<P>
The other joint project between Egypt and the Getty is a scientific study and 
conservation treatment of wall paintings in the 3,200-year-old tomb of 
Nefertari, the favorite wife on Ramses II, in West Thebes. Salt crystals and 
loose plaster threatened elaborate paintings depicting the elegantly dressed 
queen and her entourage. 
</P>
<P>
Considered one of the best surviving examples of New Kingdom artwork, the tomb 
had been in a precarious condition ever since its discovery in 1904 by Italian 
Egyptologist Ernesto Schiaparelli. Various studies and ill-advised restoration 
had done little to help the situation over the years. But the recent joint 
project provided a thorough analysis of problems at the site, prescribed 
treatment and set experts to working on emergency conservation measures that 
have stabilized the wall paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Egyptian workers spent about five years on the project. "At that rate, with 
about 1,000 tombs in Egypt, it will take 5,000 years to take care of all of 
them," Tawfik said. 
</P>
<P>
A daunting task, but he says such efforts are essential to national pride and 
to the fundamental sense of history that permeates every Egyptian child's 
education. The job is also "sensitive," he said, because his organization must 
balance the concerns of ethnic and religious groups in Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing is to maintain what we have, to publish what we have," Tawfik 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, but how does he set priorities? 
</P>
<P>
By responding to "what is falling down, what is having a heart attack."

CRITIC AT LARGE: JOHN CLEESE IS DEVILISHLY GOOD AS 'SCREWTAPE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, Times Arts Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Cleese is a man of improbable versatility, one in an apparently endless 
line of latter-day university wits who come down from Cambridge and Oxford with 
their reputations already formed and careers awaiting them. 
</P>
<P>
Cleese, he of the Monty Python gang and "Fawlty Towers," is best-known as one 
of the most serenely splendid comic actors of our day, a master absurdist whose 
most frequent impersonation is of a tightly furled bureaucrat whose facade of 
imperial confidence is hopelessly fragile and, shattering, reveals the panicky 
and foolish chap beneath. 
</P>
<P>
But Cleese is, like most of the Oxbridge troupers, nothing so simple as a 
performer only. He has written the script of "Life of Brian" and related works 
and did the music for "Monty Python's the Meaning of Life." He was comically 
endearing as an incompetent philanderer in "A Fish Called Wanda," performing 
with a seeming casualness that is the mark of a very expert farceur. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in a startling reversal of field, Cleese has recorded C. S. Lewis' "The 
Screwtape Letters" on audiocassette (Audio Literature Inc.). And an 
incandescent piece of work it is, a rare and perfect matching of voice and 
material, to be ranked with Peter Ustinov doing James Thurber and John le Carre 
reading his own work. 
</P>
<P>
The letters are from Screwtape, a highly placed assistant to Satan (referred 
to, however, simply as Our Father Below). They are addressed to Screwtape's 
young nephew, Wormwood, a minor tempter who is trying to lure an otherwise 
unidentified man from the Enemy (God, that would be, in Lewis' wonderfully 
inverted scheme) to Our Side. 
</P>
<P>
What Cleese does is not a reading but a dramatic monologue of infinite and 
startling variety. He chides, he cajoles, he sneers; he is exasperated, then 
annoyed, then furious, then so apoplectic with rage that he turns briefly into 
a large white worm, as a kind of sotto voce footnote explains. 
</P>
<P>
Calm restored, Screwtape is a whispery voice of patience, careful explanation, 
sweet reason. It can't last, of course, because Wormwood (who presumably works 
on the client's subconscious) is letting his man slip away into the comforting 
arms of Christianity. This, despite Wormwood's subliminal appeals to both pride 
and despair, indifference, worldly pleasures and the fiery satisfactions of the 
flesh. 
</P>
<P>
In all these modes Cleese provides an amazing and quite unexpected 
demonstration of his range as an actor. His visible image -- that blandly 
handsome and calculatedly vacuous expression -- is so familiar and successful 
that his public may not be not ready for a Cleese Hamlet. But it's clear that 
he has a previously undisclosed set of muscles. 
</P>
<P>
His performance of "The Screwtape Letters" is frequently hilarious. Nothing new 
there, except that now the laughter is subtly different. It is the delighted 
surprise of a tour de force performance. But the delight is not least in Lewis' 
ingenious text. 
</P>
<P>
Cleese's vivid reading provides a wonderful clarity for Lewis' topsy-turvy 
fantasy. All the inversions of thought that follow on his notion of Christian 
apologetics disguised as a defense of deviltry are somehow even easier to hear 
than to read. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, a scholar of medieval literature, had been converted to Christianity 
through the influence of his fellow medievalist, J.R.R. Tolkien (to whom "The 
Screwtape Letters" is dedicated). 
</P>
<P>
Once converted, Lewis began to put Christian thought, especially in the matter 
of good and evil, into science fiction ("Out of the Silent Planet"), into 
children's fantasies ("The Narnia Chronicles") and in 1942 into "The Screwtape 
Letters." 
</P>
<P>
The book is provocative, wherever one stands theologically. It is a lively work 
of the imagination. The battle for the man's soul is amusingly suspenseful. 
These days, nearly a half-century later, the book becomes the more moving 
because the real war and the air raids were the real and relevant background to 
the theology. The book is to that extent history as well as philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
The revelations are provided equally by Cleese and Lewis. The text has been 
slightly abridged, four of the 31 letters cut. The two cassettes have a playing 
time of three hours. Audio Literature Inc. is at 3800 Palos Verdes Way, South 
San Francisco, Calif. 94080. The firm earlier released a prose version of "The 
Book of Job," excellently read by Peter Coyote.

DRIVER KILLED AS TRUCK HITS FREEWAY PILLAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN KENDALL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A speeding concrete pumping truck apparently blew a tire, veered sharply out of 
control and smashed into a pillar on the San Diego Freeway in Inglewood early 
Monday, killing the driver, injuring a motorist and jamming commuter traffic 
for hours, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the busy freeway was closed until the truck's wreckage could be cleared 
away. Traffic was backed up about two miles in both directions from the 
accident scene at the La Cienega Boulevard overpass. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nearby Streets Jammed 
</P>
<P>
The southbound lanes of the freeway were closed for about eight hours after the 
accident, reopening at 12:20 p.m. The northbound side was closed for about two 
hours, after which two lanes reopened. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of northbound motorists slowly edged past the wreckage until 9:30 
a.m., when all northbound lanes reopened, Caltrans reported. Nearby streets, 
such as Sepulveda Boulevard, were jammed. 
</P>
<P>
The truck driver was identified as Norton Roosevelt, 54, of Compton. 
</P>
<P>
CHP spokeswoman Diana Vickers blamed "excessive speed" for the shattering 
impact, which tore chucks off of a center divider and cracked a 
steel-reinforced pillar, but she declined to estimate the speed of the truck. 
"He was going faster than 55," she said. "We got that by the way the truck was 
damaged." 
</P>
<P>
The big three-axle vehicle, owned by American Standard Concrete Pumping Inc. of 
Gardena, was northbound at 4:50 a.m. when it suddenly veered across two lanes 
of traffic, topped the center divider and struck a support pillar on the 
southbound side of the freeway, CHP Officer Vicki Ogden said. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like the truck exploded on impact," Ogden said. 
</P>
<P>
"All the axles had been ripped from the carriage. The engine was out. It was 
just everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
CHP Officer Mark Howard said marks on the freeway indicate that the truck may 
have blown a left front tire. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy tow trucks and a flatbed truck were summoned to remove the wreckage, 
including the engine and front axle, which were thrown into the freeway lanes. 
</P>
<P>
A flying four-pound chunk of metal from the wreck shattered the windshield of a 
southbound car driven by Efrain Orozco, 31, of Northridge, causing what the CHP 
described as major facial injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Orozco was taken to Centinela Hospital, where he underwent surgery and was 
later reported in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Debris Hit Cars 
</P>
<P>
Debris also struck cars driven by Bernal Bowen, 72, of Bakersfield, and Eva M. 
Alexander, 64, of Sylmar. The CHP said neither woman was injured, but their 
cars had to be towed away. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans called in a structural engineer, who examined the cracked support 
column and decided that it would be safe to reopen the La Cienega overpass to 
traffic.

ORDER CURBING ABORTION PROTEST ACTIONS EXTENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY PASTERNAK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge on Monday indefinitely extended an order forbidding 
anti-abortion forces to block entrances to California women's health clinics 
targeted for major demonstrations, including a Los Angeles-area protest 
scheduled next week. 
</P>
<P>
But an organizer for Operation Rescue, the group behind the demonstrations, 
said the order will not change his plans. 
</P>
<P>
"What the judge just said is that it's still illegal to save a baby's life in 
this country," said Joseph Foreman, the group's national field director. "I 
will not proceed any differently than I have in the past when babies are going 
to be murdered." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima granted a request by the 
American Civil Liberties Union for a preliminary injunction barring Operation 
Rescue from bodily blocking entrances to clinics that perform abortions. 
</P>
<P>
The injunction also prohibits demonstrating closer than 15 feet from clinic 
entrances and exits. 
</P>
<P>
The terms mirror those of a temporary restraining order granted March 3 by 
another judge, which was due to expire Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Tashima said he would not, however, direct the Los Angeles Police Department to 
enforce his order. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Cmdr. William Booth said the department is "not empowered nor 
obligated to enforce a federal order, unless we are specifically mentioned" but 
added that city law provides for passage to and from private property and 
unobstructed conduct of business. 
</P>
<P>
"We intend to enforce the law," Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
Tashima's order remains in force until the trial of a class-action lawsuit by 
the ACLU. No date has been set for the proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
Police have made more than 7,000 arrests over the last year during 
anti-abortion demonstrations, in which some protesters chained themselves and 
large objects, including cars, to the doors of clinics. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, despite the March 2 order, nearly 200 protesters were arrested at 
clinics in Chico, Fresno and Oakland. Similar demonstrations are expected in 
San Diego this weekend, before a "holy week of rescue" in Los Angeles, March 
22-25.

WASTE HAULER FINED $1 MILLION IN PRICE-FIXING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Mike Delaney and Tom Papageorge got a letter from a small Los Angeles 
commercial-waste hauler in October, 1985, complaining of harassment from 
competitors, the two Los Angeles County prosecutors were not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
Several years earlier, Papageorge had looked into similar allegations of 
price-fixing and conspiracy against trade in the cutthroat multimillion-dollar 
industry. But he didn't get very far because of the industry's unusually 
clannish nature, reinforced by many familial ties. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a difficult industry to break into," the deputy district attorney 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
But this time, Papageorge and Delaney got a big break. Their investigator 
turned up an insider who spilled the beans. 
</P>
<P>
That touched off a wide-ranging investigation that culminated Monday with a 
record $1-million fine to be paid by Waste Management of California Inc., the 
local branch of the nation's largest solid-waste disposal firm. 
</P>
<P>
The case is the largest criminal antitrust case in California history. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Waste Management's no-contest plea, two of its officials and 
several other defendants also entered no-contest pleas in Los Angeles Municipal 
Court on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Waste Management and several other large haulers were accused of plotting to 
eliminate competition and charging inflated prices. In addition, the firms were 
accused of "blitzing" competitors who refused to go along by offering their 
customers lower, often "predatory," below-cost rates. These arrangements led to 
higher prices that "affect all of us," Papageorge said. 
</P>
<P>
The case began more than three years ago when the district attorney's office 
received a letter from Carry All Disposal, a Pico Rivera firm that picks up 
trash from commercial outlets in South Gate and Cudahy. 
</P>
<P>
Carry All said its trucks were being followed by agents of GSX Corp., a chief 
competitor. Once GSX learned of Carry All's customers, GSX then "blitzed" Carry 
All's customers, offering better prices in an attempt to eliminate its 
competitor. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, a Carry All driver stopped his truck and confronted the man who 
was tailing him, who said, " 'I'm just trying to learn the business,' " 
according to Delaney. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't long before Carry All began receiving cancellations from 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
The break in the case came when this particular GSX blitz against Carry All was 
well-documented by internal documents that turned up during a search of GSX 
premises, Delaney said. 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing Carry All's letter, the prosecutors assigned investigator 
Dewain E. Barrett to look into the allegations. Within weeks, Barrett found an 
employee at Carry All who had once been the sales manager at GSX. The new Carry 
All employee began detailing GSX's predatory tactics. 
</P>
<P>
Using this information and, after obtaining a search warrant, Delaney and 
Papageorge found eight to 10 boxes of detailed GSX internal memos and expense 
vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
"We got much more at GSX than we had anticipated," Delaney recalled. 
</P>
<P>
The former GSX sales manager then sat down with the two county prosecutors and 
explained the documents, many of which contained only cryptic or partial notes. 
</P>
<P>
Papageorge and Delaney were especially surprised to find numerous notes, made 
by diligent GSX telephone receptionists, spelling out the firm's illegal 
contacts with competitors. Among the messages recorded by receptionists were 
some from GSX competitors demanding, "Why are you talking to my clients?" 
according to Delaney. 
</P>
<P>
"It's rare to find the smoking gun," Papageorge said. "The challenge of these 
cases usually is having to prove a conspiracy when agreements are mostly 
verbal." 
</P>
<P>
What the documents clearly showed was that GSX, and many of its competitors, 
often got together surreptitiously to eliminate competition and control prices. 
</P>
<P>
According to the prosecutors, the conspiracy included agreements not to take 
away one another's customers. The firms often resorted to below-cost sales 
pitches, or blitzes, to take away customers from haulers who did not go along 
with the arrangement to divide up customers. 
</P>
<P>
Other evidence of collusion, Delaney and Papageorge said, were GSX "hit lists," 
in which the firm had targeted competitors for blitzes. 
</P>
<P>
According to the prosecutors, when a commercial customer sought to change 
haulers, the current and the prospective hauler often would get together and 
have the latter offer a "highball" price to the customer. Then the two firms 
would divide the profits, often with payoffs from one hauler to the other as 
high as $10,000, according to Delaney. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, customers who did not change haulers were "stung" regularly 
with annual price increases of 15% to 20%, the deputy district attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
There was open competition only when new accounts were available, such as when 
a mini-mall opened, Delaney said. 
</P>
<P>
"The standing rule was non-competition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the wealth of GSX documents confiscated by Delaney and 
Papageorge, the firm in April, 1986, came forth seeking a deal, offering to 
help "clean up" the industry. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big break for us," Delaney said. 
</P>
<P>
GSX made available to the two prosecutors numerous company officials who 
"essentially bared their souls," pleading that they had inherited these 
practices, Delaney said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grand Jury Testimony 
</P>
<P>
The GSX officials also testified at a county grand jury investigation in early 
1987, in which they freely named names. 
</P>
<P>
That led to the June, 1987, charges filed against the defendants, who pleaded 
no-contest. 
</P>
<P>
Until the GSX break came, Delaney said, "we didn't even know" about Waste 
Management and the other firms. "You just never know where a conspiracy will 
lead," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors alleged that the defendants, along with other, smaller, 
uncharged firms, operated what amounted to a secret cartel, dividing up 
commercial accounts "so they could charge any price . . . without fear of 
competition." 
</P>
<P>
Their customers included restaurants, gas stations, theaters and other 
businesses throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
GSX eventually was fined $236,500 for its part in the conspiracy. In a 
separate, ongoing federal antitrust investigation in nearly a dozen other 
cities, GSX earlier this year also paid a $500,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Waste Management, Western Waste Industries Inc., and 
Angelus-Hudson Inc. and five of their employees also have pleaded no-contest to 
similar charges. 
</P>
<P>
Wiley A. Scott Jr., 33, Waste Management's operations manager in Sun Valley, 
faces up to 60 days in jail. And Clifford R. Chamblee, 65, the firm's former 
general manager in Gardena, faces up to 250 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
John Marderosian, 56, an official of System Disposal Service Inc., which was 
bought by GSX, also faces up to 60 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Fines 
</P>
<P>
Angelus-Hudson has agreed to pay a $75,000 fine. And Western Waste has agreed 
to pay $900,000 in the antitrust case, plus another $100,000 for an unrelated 
toxic waste violation in which it allegedly hid hazardous wastes in household 
trash, dumping them illegally in three county landfills. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Western Waste's sales manager, Ishkan (Ara) Gordian, 44, 
agreed to a 45-day jail sentence for his no-contest plea in the antitrust 
prosecution -- the first such penalty to be imposed under the felony provisions 
of the Cartwright Act, the state's basic antitrust law, according to Dist. 
Atty. Ira Reiner. 
</P>
<P>
Still facing criminal charges in the illegal dumping case is Western Waste's 
vice president and manager, Hacob (Jack) Shirvanian. His trial is set for April 
24 in Los Angeles Superior Court.

EX-BASKETBALL PLAYER SENTENCED IN THEFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Torrance Superior Court jury on Monday convicted former UCLA and professional 
basketball player Darrell Allums on seven charges of armed robbery and one 
charge of robbery for stealing cash from Domino's Pizza deliverymen during a 
two-month series of crimes in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Allums, 30, could be sentenced to 15 years in prison when he returns to court 
April 3. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors deliberated for two days before announcing the verdict and telling 
Judge William R. Hollingsworth that they could not agree on a verdict in six 
similar robbery charges against Allums. Hollingsworth dismissed those counts. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Julie Sulman had told jurors during the eight-day trial that 
the Domino's bandit -- a "very tall" black man -- confronted the company's 
employees as they attempted to deliver pizzas at homes in Torrance, Gardena, 
Long Beach and several other communities. The thief usually used a screwdriver 
or knife to intimidate the deliverymen into turning over pouches that held from 
$15 to $230 in cash, Sulman said. 
</P>
<P>
Allums -- the 6-foot, 9-inch backup center on the UCLA team that was runner-up 
in the 1980 NCAA tournament -- acted as his own attorney in the eight-day 
trial. He contended that he was the innocent victim of faulty identifications 
by the Domino's deliverymen.

Conservancy had endorsed Yaroslavsky. The conservancy, as a state agency, is 
prohibited from making political endorsements and did not do so.

NBC ORDERED TO TURN OVER JACKSON TAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge Monday ordered NBC to allow the copying of an uncensored videotape in 
which Long Beach Police Officer Mark Dickey is seen allegedly pushing the head 
of police activist Don Jackson through a plate-glass window. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach city prosecutor's office had requested the tape as it prepares 
for Jackson's trial on a misdemeanor charge of interfering with a police 
officer and resisting arrest. It is scheduled to begin Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The tape would be the same version of the Jan. 14 incident, shot both from a 
hidden camera inside Jackson's car and from an NBC van. The entire tape has 
aired locally and portions have been seen on national television. 
</P>
<P>
However, Long Beach Municipal Court Judge Gary Hahn ordered that the network 
make available a version complete with obscenities that Dickey shouted to 
Jackson and without a voice-over description of events by a news commentator.

PANEL TO HELP PLAN DOWNTOWN'S FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley announced on Monday the formation of an advisory panel to 
help the Community Redevelopment Agency prepare for future downtown Los Angeles 
development. 
</P>
<P>
But while the mayor said it is "not only essential, but achievable," that the 
downtown area provide a "24-hour living environment" in which people can live, 
work and play, he may have left advocates for one of those activities off the 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere among the 27 community leaders appointed to the Downtown Strategic Plan 
Advisory Committee was there an "obvious housing advocate," Deputy Mayor Mike 
Gage said. 
</P>
<P>
So just a few hours after the panel was first convened, the mayor's office 
began the search for four new community leaders who could "more adequately 
cover that base," Gage said. The new members will be selected soon, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's job is to prepare a revamped blueprint for redevelopment of the 
central business district, bounded by Main Street and the Hollywood, Santa 
Monica and Harbor freeways. The new plan is to carry the city through the year 
2010.

PLEA DEAL IN WORKS FOR ALLEGED HACKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An alleged Panorama City computer hacker considered too dangerous to be allowed 
to use phones without supervision is considering a guilty plea in a deal with 
the government, a prosecutor disclosed in a Los Angeles court Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. James Sanders made the disclosure at a scheduled pretrial 
hearing for Kevin David Mitnick, who is accused of infiltrating computer 
systems in the United States and England. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders asked U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer to delay the hearing until 
Wednesday, saying, "We're working on a possible plea in this case and we think 
we can resolve it by that time." 
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Mitnick was first indicted on computer fraud charges Dec. 20. A 
superseding indictment expanding the charges was issued last month. 
</P>
<P>
Mitnick, who has a prior conviction for computer-related crime, was accused of 
unauthorized use of MCI long-distance codes to tap into computers at Leeds 
University in England and USC and of causing $4 million in damage to a Digital 
Equipment Corp. computer system.

MOTHER ARRESTED AFTER 2 CHILDREN ARE STABBED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A West Covina woman was arrested late Monday after she allegedly stabbed her 
7-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter with a kitchen knife, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers were called to the Mardina Street home of Phyllis Patricia Shademan, 
29, after her son escaped through a bathroom window after being stabbed at 
least 10 times. The boy went to the home of a neighbor, who called authorities, 
West Covina Police Lt. John Schimanski said. 
</P>
<P>
Police found the girl crying under a bed with several wounds in her back. 
</P>
<P>
"All (the officers) saw was blood, all over the house," Schimanski said. 
</P>
<P>
Shademan was sitting in the bathroom "in a disoriented state," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman's husband, Manharra, a cab driver, was at work. 
</P>
<P>
Both children were in critical but stable condition at Queen of the Valley 
Hospital, a nursing supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
Shademan was booked on suspicion of attempted murder, Schimanski said. A motive 
for the attacks was not known. 
</P>
<P>
A bloodied kitchen knife believed used in the stabbings was recovered, the 
lieutenant said.

TEACHER 'SHUDDERS' AT THOUGHT OF RETURNING TO STABBING SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Olive Vista Junior High School teacher Cynthia Edwards said Monday that she 
"shudders" thinking about returning to the classroom where she was stabbed a 
week ago by one of her students. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to cry a lot," said Edwards, 37, in a telephone interview. "I keep 
asking myself, 'Why? What did I do except try to teach?' " 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, who is recovering at home after being released from the hospital 
Friday, said she was reviewing Homer's "The Odyssey" shortly after lunch March 
6 when she was attacked by a 15-year-old boy who had been a disciplinary 
problem since transferring into her English class in February. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Boy Charged With Assault 
</P>
<P>
The boy, whose name is being withheld because of his age, has been charged with 
assault with a deadly weapon. At a hearing Thursday, a Juvenile Court judge 
said the boy had shown several students a knife and told them he was going to 
attack Edwards. He is being held at Sylmar Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"He was having a disagreement with another young fellow, using a lot of 
profanity," said Edwards, who taught in two East Los Angeles junior high 
schools for 10 years before transferring to the Sylmar school in September. 
</P>
<P>
The day before, the boy had been assigned to write "I will be quiet in Period 5 
classes" 125 times as a punishment for repeatedly speaking out of turn, Edwards 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The class was working, but he kept interrupting," Edwards said. "One student 
doesn't have the right to interrupt the whole class, so I attempted to get rid 
of him as quickly as possible, but evidently I didn't work quick enough." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards said she began writing a referral on the boy that included a request to 
speak with his parents when she noticed him approaching her desk. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt a pain in my shoulder, and I assumed that he hit me," Edwards said. "He 
looked around at the classroom and then ran out. . . . One of my students came 
up and said, 'You have a knife in your back.' " 
</P>
<P>
Edwards said the attack shows how teachers in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District need more security such as emergency telephones in classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had a phone, I could have called security to get the student out of the 
classroom without having to take the five or six minutes to write the referral 
and let him hurt me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
About half of the district's 600 or so schools, including Olive Vista, have 
some type of intercom system that link classrooms to the main office, district 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Emergency Telephones 
</P>
<P>
But no more than 25 schools have emergency telephones that can be programmed to 
signal an emergency immediately to school officials, said Rod Macdonell, the 
district's electrical supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, who had an emergency telephone in her classroom last year while 
teaching at Stevenson Junior High School in East Los Angeles, said the Olive 
Vista intercom system is too cumbersome to use in emergencies. Teachers there 
must push a button and wait for an office secretary to notice a flashing light 
and then go to another room to answer the call using a special telephone, 
school officials said.

UPDATING BIRTH CONTROL;

<P>
LOOKING TO THE FUTURE, RESEARCHERS EXAMINE EFFECTS OF NEW METHODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Birth control research moves slowly, but it is moving, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
Among the technologies working their way through the investigational pipeline 
are: 
</P>
<P>
Norplant: An implantable contraceptive that inhibits ovulation and also 
thickens cervical mucous, impeding sperm penetration. Six match-size silastic 
capsules are implanted in the upper arm and release the ovulation-inhibiting 
hormone levonorgestrel over a period of five years. 
</P>
<P>
The Population Council, the New York-based nonprofit organization that 
developed Norplant, filed for FDA marketing approval last August, but has not 
yet received it, spokeswoman Sandra Waldman said. 
</P>
<P>
A potential drawback: A change in bleeding, including prolonged menstruation or 
"breakthrough" bleeding, said Dr. Donna Shoupe, a USC assistant professor of 
obstetrics and gynecology who's studied Norplant. 
</P>
<P>
 Expected effectiveness: 97%-99%. 
</P>
<P>
 RU-486: Perhaps the most controversial technique under study in the United 
States, RU-486 is manufacturer's shorthand for a drug that interrupts pregnancy 
in early stages. In France, it was withdrawn from the market in October, 1988, 
after a campaign by pro-life advocates. Two days later, however, the government 
ordered the drug back on the market. 
</P>
<P>
A so-called anti-progestin, RU-486 works by "blocking the effects of 
progesterone, the hormone that supports pregnancy," said Dr. David A. Grimes, a 
professor of obstetrics/gynecology and preventive medicine who's studying the 
drug at USC. In the absence of progesterone, the lining of the uterus breaks 
down as it would in a normal menstrual cycle. 
</P>
<P>
In the last four years, 13 different regimens have been tested on 300 women in 
USC studies, Grimes said. Most promising: a single 600-milligram dose that 
interrupted pregnancy 90% of the time in 50 women studied. 
</P>
<P>
Taken within two weeks of a missed menstrual period, the drug is 80% effective, 
according to a new report by Washington's nonprofit Population Crisis 
Committee, and even more so when combined with synthetic prostaglandins. 
Possible side effects include hemorrhage and incomplete or failed abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Expected effectiveness: 95%. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonscalpel Vasectomy: Under study by the Population Council and VasTech 
Medical Products Inc., of New Brunswick, N.J., nonscalpel vasectomy promises 
almost immediate recovery. After a local anesthetic is administered, scrotal 
skin is punctured with a Vasocclude, a device much like a stapler with 
preloaded clips, and the device is maneuvered near the vas deferens or 
spermatic duct, which is sealed off by a clip. 
</P>
<P>
Clinical studies are scheduled to start this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Expected effectiveness: 99%. 
</P>
<P>
 Plug Sterilization: In this potentially reversible male sterilization 
procedure, two tiny puncture holes are made in each vas deferens, then two 
silicone plugs are inserted into the ducts. A tiny space between the two acts 
as a trap for sperm that may have gotten past the first plug. 
</P>
<P>
"The vas is hardly damaged," said Dr. Lourens Zaneveld , a professor of 
obstetrics and gynecology at Chicago's Rush University. "When the plugs are 
removed, a small suture recloses the duct and the hole closes almost 
immediately." 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary clinical studies, under way here and in South America, showed a 
third of the men were sterile but in two-thirds, some sperm still passed by the 
plugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Expected effectiveness: 99% as contraceptive; 90% reversibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-Sperm Vaccine: Human studies are expected to begin this year or next for 
a vaccine that attacks sperm and reduces their "fertilizability," said 
Northwestern researcher Dr. Gerald Zatuchni , a professor of obstetrics and 
gynecology at Northwestern University in Chicago, Ill. First, an enzyme called 
lactic dehydrogenase is extracted from the sperm and injected into his partner. 
She, in turn, develops antibodies that attack the sperm, reducing motility and 
ability to fertilize eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Expected effectiveness: 90%. 
</P>
<P>
 Injectables for Women: A biodegradable microcapsule of norethindrone, the same 
synthetic hormone found in most oral contraceptives, is injected into the 
buttocks, allowing for slow release of the hormone. Farthest along in clinical 
trials is a 90-day capsule; 30-day and 6-month systems are also being 
developed, said Zatuchni. 
</P>
<P>
 Expected effectiveness: 99%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Injectables for Men: Periodic injections of a synthetic version of the hormone 
testosterone may reduce sperm counts to zero or other safe levels, researchers 
say. Testosterone inhibits sperm production much like oral contraceptives 
inhibit ovulation, said Dr. C. Alvin Paulsen, a researcher and professor at the 
University of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Other researchers, including Dr. Ronald S. Swerdloff, director of the UCLA 
Population Research Center and professor of medicine at Harbor-UCLA Medical 
Center in Torrance, are studying injections of testosterone combined with other 
substances that together "turn off" the sperm production system. 
</P>
<P>
 Expected effectiveness: Unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 Female Condoms: "When people first look at a female condom, they're not too 
impressed," said USC's Shoupe, one of several researchers investigating various 
types of female condoms, also called intravaginal pouches. The one she's 
studying looks like a plastic tube with a ring at each end. The upper ring is 
inserted like a diaphragm to prevent sperm passage while the other is 
positioned near the vaginal opening. Prelubricated with the spermicide 
nonoxynol-9, such condoms may help prevent the spread of sexually transmitted 
diseases, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Expected effectiveness: 88%-96%.

YOUR BODY: ORGANIC PRODUCE: WHAT IT MEANS AND HOW TO FIND IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Does the growth regulator Alar make apples unsafe to eat? Do a multitude of 
pesticides on other fruits and vegetables increase your risk of cancer? 
</P>
<P>
With each new report about dietary health hazards comes added anxiety for 
shoppers. To cope, some have switched to "organic" food -- and they're going to 
great lengths to get it. 
</P>
<P>
A case in point: Betty Line of Rancho Cucamonga who, after calling several 
supermarkets in her area, drove 45 minutes to Glendale Saturday afternoon to 
make certain her 2-year-old son Thomas would eat organic produce that night. 
</P>
<P>
But once in the market, consumers often face a sea of signs describing fresh 
fruits and vegetables. Equal in the eyes of Califoria law: organically grown, 
organic, naturally grown, wild, ecologically grown and biologically grown. 
</P>
<P>
All mean "no synthetically compounded materials have been used in the growing 
or processing of the product," said Frank Nava of the food and drug branch of 
the state Department of Health Services, the agency responsible for enforcement 
of state Health and Safety Codes. 
</P>
<P>
Under that law, growers who plan to market their crops as "organic" may not use 
synthetically compounded fertilizers, pesticides or growth regulators from 12 
months prior to planting through processing. 
</P>
<P>
Produce that carries the words California Certified Organic Farmers or CCOF 
certified has the blessing of the California Certified Organic Farmers, a Santa 
Cruz-based organization of 450 growers, and "has been tracked from planting 
through processing to insure that it's chemical-free," said spokesman Phil 
McGee. 
</P>
<P>
Growers applying for membership must wait at least 12 months, he said, while 
information is collected to make certain state guidelines have been followed. 
In addition, organic growers must improve the soil and fulfill several other 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Some labels don't attest to purity, Nava added. No sprays used doesn't 
necessarily mean no pesticides, he said. And California grown means only that. 
</P>
<P>
The term sustainable agriculture does not necessarily mean produce has been 
raised organically, noted Mark Lipson, a spokesman for CCOF. Rather, 
sustainable agriculture refers to an approach that attempts to minimize 
negative effects on the environment and people while maintaining profitability 
for farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Yet another term, integrated pest management, indicates pesticide use has been 
reduced but not eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
In a survey of 900 consumers in Marin, San Diego and Sacramento counties, UC 
Davis agricultural economist Desmond Davis found 22% regularly look for organic 
foods, up from 3% in the early '70s, according to a U.S. Department of 
Agriculture report. 
</P>
<P>
Fighting Baldness 
</P>
<P>
When topical minoxidil was approved last year for the treatment of baldness, it 
was good news for some of the 50 million Americans with thinning hair. 
</P>
<P>
But physicians and others who have been studying and prescribing minoxidil say 
it doesn't work for some users and may pose risks for others with 
cardiovascular problems. Regular check-ups, they add, are a good idea for all 
minoxidil users. 
</P>
<P>
Ideal candidates for topical use of the drug are men younger than 50 who are 
just beginning to lose their hair, said Dr. Richard Odom, a UC San Francisco 
clinical professor of dermatology who has prescribed the drug for four years. 
</P>
<P>
Receding hairlines don't seem to respond as well as crown baldness, said Dr. H. 
Irving Katz, a University of Minnesota clinical professor of dermatology. And 
twice-daily applications appear to be a lifetime commitment: Those who 
discontinued minoxidil use noticed further hair loss within two or three 
months, said Katz, who recently published a review of minoxidil in the journal 
Cutis. 
</P>
<P>
Clinical trials sponsored by the drug's manufacturer, Upjohn Co. of Kalamazoo, 
Mich., found 39% of men had moderate or dense hair growth with its use. 
</P>
<P>
How minoxidil -- originally an oral treatment for high blood pressure -- works 
to prevent hair loss still isn't understood, said Upjohn spokeswoman Kaye 
Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
Combining minoxidil with Retin-A, an acne medication also used to treat 
wrinkles, appears to improve results, said Dr. Jack Jaffe, medical director of 
Physicians Hair Center, one of two such clinics in the Boston area. "Both act 
on the hair follicles directly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Fitness Profile 
</P>
<P>
Physically fit people are likely to be energetic, optimistic, perfectionistic 
and competitive, a new study of physical fitness and personality suggests. 
</P>
<P>
But the notion people who exercise vigorously do so to compensate for 
psychological deficiencies wasn't borne out by the research of Joyce Hogan, 
associate professor of psychology at the University of Tulsa. 
</P>
<P>
Hogan, who published her findings in the Journal of Personality and Social 
Psychology, administered physical fitness and personality tests to two groups 
of male exercisers: 97 from the Navy, ages 18 to 33, and 35 applicants for law 
enforcement jobs, 20 to 40. Both groups were above average in terms of physical 
fitness and psychological health, she found. Their personality characteristics 
are "the conceptual opposite of the disease-prone personality," she said, which 
is marked by anxiety, hostility and depression. 
</P>
<P>
Hogan believes her study dispels the notion that "people in very good physical 
condition are driven by their own neuroses, such as lack of self-confidence. My 
research shows there's no relationship between traditional psychopathology and 
level of fitness." 
</P>
<P>
Based on the results, Hogan speculates that "personality may moderate the link 
between fitness and physical health." 
</P>
<P>
"What she's describing is the Type A personality," said Steve Farrell, an 
exercise physiologist at the Institute for Aerobics Research in Dallas. "Those 
people are more likely to adhere to their exercise program. But that doesn't 
mean (the more easygoing) Type Bs won't adhere, too," he said.

today issued an order barring New York railroad employees from honoring any 
Eastern picket lines as long as the dispute continues. 
</P>
<P>
The permanent injunction by U.S. District Judge Robert Patterson stops rail 
workers from "engaging in sympathy strikes, slowdowns or other concerted labor 
activity" in connection with picketing by striking Eastern workers. The ruling 
does not prohibit striking Eastern workers from setting up pickets at railroad 
stations but forces railroad workers to cross those picket lines.

<P>
Three suspects in a Burbank liquor store robbery in which a clerk was shot and 
critically injured were arrested when their getaway car crashed during a police 
chase, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
The robbery occurred at La Paz Liquor in the 4100 block of West Magnolia 
Boulevard at 10:45 p.m. Monday, police said. An unidentified clerk was shot in 
the stomach and was in critical condition at St. Joseph Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
After the robbery, the suspects were spotted speeding from the scene, and 
patrol officers chased them onto the northbound Golden State Freeway. Police 
said the suspects fired shots at the officers but no one was struck. When the 
suspects attempted to exit the freeway at Buena Vista Street, their car turned 
over on the off-ramp. The suspects were only slightly injured and attempted to 
escape but were captured by police nearby. 
</P>
<P>
The three Los Angeles men were identified as Otis Johnson, 29; Franklin 
Ragsdale, 23, and Tommy A. Marshall, 23. Police said all three were being held 
without bail on suspicion of attempted murder.

Police are seeking three men who used a yellow school bus while committing 
armed robberies in Pacoima and San Fernando, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
The first robbery occurred at 5:30 p.m. Monday in Pacoima when the Los Angeles 
Unified School District bus pulled up in front of a produce vendor at Van Nuys 
Boulevard and DeHaven Avenue, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The vendor, Clissiro Pacheco, 27, of Pacoima, unsuspectingly stepped on to the 
bus to deliver a bag of oranges to the three men on board, police said. But the 
door of the bus closed and the men, one armed with a rifle, drove off. Police 
said Pacheco was robbed of $130, then let off three blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
Two hours later in San Fernando, a school bus pulled up behind Luis Garcia, 18, 
who was sitting in his car with a friend, Xochilt Gomez, 19, in the 900 block 
of Maclay Avenue. Police said two armed men got out of the bus and robbed 
Garcia and Gomez and stole the car. The bus was driven away by a third person. 
</P>
<P>
Police said no arrests have been made and the bus, which is suspected of having 
been stolen, has not been located.

<P>
An Anaheim man was in custody this morning while police tried to figure out his 
role in an apparent shoot-out on a La Habra street. 
</P>
<P>
Police responding to reports of gunfire in the 400 block of West Las Lomas 
Drive Monday night found bloodstains inside a car and on the sidewalk, La Habra 
Police Lt. John Buchholz said. Two handguns were recovered nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Buchholz said police were still trying to determine what happened in the 8:30 
p.m. shooting. Based on a preliminary investigation, he said, police searched 
for Raymond M. Velasquez, 26, for seven hours and arrested him at a relative's 
house in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Velasquez, who was suffering from superficial gunshot wounds to the face and 
arms, was treated at La Habra Community Hospital, Buchholz said. A parolee, he 
was held at the La Habra police station. 
</P>
<P>
Buchholz said another man who was arrested near the scene also was in police 
custody this morning. He has not been identified.

RECORD $10.7 BILLION WITHDRAWN FROM S&amp;LS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Depositors withdrew a record $10.7 billion from the nation's savings and loan 
institutions in January, in one month surpassing withdrawals for all of 1988, 
the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
James Barth, chief economist of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, said four of 
every five of the nation's 2,945 S&amp;Ls had deposit outflows in January. 
</P>
<P>
Barth said a preliminary estimate shows withdrawals declining only slightly in 
February to between $8 billion and $9 billion. Net withdrawals for all of 1988 
were $8.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Barth attributed the bulk of the withdrawals this year to the fact that 
competitors, such as money market mutual funds, have more promptly increased 
interest rates than thrifts have on savings accounts. In January, money market 
funds, on average, offered rates 1.25 percentage points higher than S&amp;Ls, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deliberate Strategy 
</P>
<P>
Another portion of the withdrawals occurred as part of a deliberate strategy by 
regulators to shrink ailing institutions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Barth acknowledged that some of the withdrawals were caused by 
confidence problems amid growing publicity about the condition of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush announced his plan for restoring S&amp;Ls to health on Feb. 6. 
In the weeks immediately preceding that, the Administration floated a proposal, 
since abandoned, to charge bank and S&amp;L depositors a fee to help rescue the 
S&amp;L insurance fund. 
</P>
<P>
"That sort of talk undoubtedly induced some people to believe, 'Why keep your 
deposits at thrifts?' " Barth said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
4th Consecutive Month 
</P>
<P>
February would mark the fourth consecutive month of heavy outflows from 
S&amp;Ls. Outflows totaled $8.3 billion in December and $7 billion in November. 
From May through October, outflows totaled $9.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In the first four months of 1988 there were deposit inflows of $16.2 billion as 
investors pulled their money out of the volatile stock market and put it into 
federally insured institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Net deposit flows do not include interest credited to savings accounts. 
Including the interest, S&amp;L deposits grew 4.2% in 1988, the slowest pace 
since the recession year of 1981.

Two members of Sweden's prestigious Academy of Letters, guardian of the Nobel 
Literature Prize, resigned their life memberships today over the committee's 
refusal to fully support author Salman Rushdie. 
</P>
<P>
Novelists Kerstin Ekman and Lars Gyllensten said they could no longer be 
members of a body which had failed to condemn Iran's death threats against the 
Indian-born British author of "The Satanic Verses." Iran's leader Ayatollah 
Ruhollah Khomeini last month called on Muslims to kill Rushdie for blasphemy 
against Islam. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the novelists' resignations came as a shock to the Academy, 
whose members are elected for life. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been better if they had been loyal to the Academy and let us 
know first," said Sture Allen, the Academy's permanent secretary.

Flight 423, en route from Atlanta to San Diego, landed at Majors Field in 
Greenville, about 40 miles northeast of Dallas, shortly after 9 a.m. "There was 
no fire and the crew and the passengers were all offloaded by the aircraft 
chutes," said Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Gerrie Cook. The 86 
passengers and crew of seven were taken by bus to Dallas-Ft. Worth 
International Airport, where they made connections to the West Coast.

Authorities today sought an intruder who used weed killer to write the words 
"We were here" on the lawn of former Prime Minister Edward Heath's home, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The intruder slipped past a police guard at the front gate of Heath's 
14th-Century mansion on property adjoining Salisbury Cathedral, 65 miles 
southwest of London, police said. A police spokesman said the incident occurred 
last week while the former Conservative Party leader was away. "The house was 
not entered and nothing was stolen," he said.

Heath was prime minister from 1970 to '74 and Conservative leader until 1975

Japan's largest brewer, Kirin, is looking to the United States and Europe to 
put the fizz back in flat profits. 
</P>
<P>
Acquisitions or joint ventures involving foreign companies are the key to a 
12-year strategy that Kirin hopes will transform it from a domestic brewer into 
a multinational, Corporate Planning Manager Osamu Hasegawa said today. Kirin 
must now look overseas because the domestic beer market is all but saturated, 
he said. "To some extent we must do some acquisitions or tie-ups with foreign 
companies." 
</P>
<P>
Kirin has long been the leader in Japan's domestic beer market, and is the 
world's fourth-largest beer producer after Anheuser-Busch, Miller and Heineken.

Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd., Japan's biggest consumer electronics 
company, today named an American to head its U.S. operations for the first time 
and said it hoped the move will make it more welcome in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The nod went to Richard A. Kraft, a 15-year veteran of the company who will 
succeed Akiya Imura as president and chief operating officer of Matsushita 
Electric Corp. of America. 
</P>
<P>
Matsushita has more than 7,000 employees in the United States, scattered from 
Hawaii to California, Illinois, Washington, Tennessee and New Jersey. It sells 
televisions, videocassette recorders and microwave ovens and other products 
under the Panasonic, Quasar and Technics brand names, as well as business and 
industrial equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft said being American would make him more effective than his predecessors 
in dealing with American employees, government bodies and communities where 
Matsushita has operations. 
</P>
<P>
"The American public today seems to be ambivalent about foreign companies in 
the United States," Kraft said. By building Matsushita's reputation as a good 
corporate citizen, he said, "We can ultimately overcome any possible friction 
and be welcome in this country."

Unocal Corp. was ordered today to pay $70,000 for alternative fuels research 
after being convicted of releasing pollutants into the air from a smokestack at 
its Wilmington refinery. The company was also ordered to pay an additional 
$5,100 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
The sentence was imposed by Municipal Court Commissioner Barry Kohn after 
Unocal attorneys pleaded no contest to three violations of South Coast Air 
Quality Management District rules that prohibit the release of excess particles 
into the atmosphere. City Atty. James Hahn said Unocal is required to pay 
$70,000 into the newly created clean fuels account established by the AQMD to 
further research aimed at developing safer and cleaner alternatives to fossil 
fuels. 
</P>
<P>
Unocal was charged with the misdemeanor violations last May as a result of 
illegal emissions monitored by AQMD inspectors the previous summer at the 
company refinery at 1660 W. Anaheim St. in Wilmington.

United Parcel Service has ordered 10 more Boeing 757-200PF jet freighters at a 
cost of about $500 million, the jetliner maker said today. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, UPS ordered 20 757-200PFs -- for "package freighters" -- and took 
options on another 15. Today's order converts 10 of those options into firm 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen planes from the original order have been delivered, with the first 
going into service in September, 1987. The newly ordered planes will be 
delivered from August, 1991, through 1992, Boeing said. 
</P>
<P>
The 757-200PF is a windowless, twin-engine jet designed to accommodate 15 cargo 
containers or pallets on its main deck.

The Raiders have signed free agent linebacker Joe Costello of the Atlanta 
Falcons. Costello, 28, spent the last three seasons with the Falcons, playing 
29 games and starting four, working at inside linebacker, outside linebacker 
and on special teams. He began his career in 1982 with the Canadian Football 
League's Montreal Concordes at defensive end, then was switched to linebacker 
with the Jacksonville Bulls in the USFL. The Central Connecticut State 
University graduate had an NFL career-high of 14 tackles in a 1987 game against 
the Cincinnati Bengals and a best of two quarterback sacks in a game against 
the Philadelphia Eagles in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Costello was available on the Falcons "unprotected list" under the new system 
of free agency in the NFL.

<P>
Two burglaries of an American judge's room caused the U.S. team to take 
security precautions today at the World Figure Skating Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Gruber of Wyomissing, Pa., fainted early today while judging the men's 
figures. "Her room was broken into twice in 48 hours, and she was under severe 
strain," U.S. team leader Harland Burge said. Gruber was replaced by substitute 
official Shirley Taylor of Australia. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team is under increased hotel security, and skaters have been advised 
not to wear their national practice uniforms.

higan State offensive tackle Tony Mandarich said he plans to drop out of school 
and move to Los Angeles to escape allegations that he has used steroids. 
</P>
<P>
"I just need to get away from everybody," Mandarich said. "A lot of people get 
on my nerves. It really annoys me when people talk behind my back." 
</P>
<P>
Allegations of steroid use have haunted the 320-pound tackle despite being 
cleared by three recent drug tests. Mandarich, named to the All-America team 
for the last two years, is expected to be the first-round draft pick of the 
Green Bay Packers, who own the second pick overall in next month's draft. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a disappointment to me that he's decided to leave when he's so close to 
graduating," said Charlie Wilson, Michigan State's athletic academic counselor, 
adding that Mandarich is 17 credits, or one term, shy of earning a bachelor's 
degree.

MAYORAL RACE 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Nate Holden in a press release issued Monday said that he fully 
supports the Los Angeles Police Department's efforts to combat gang violence 
and drugs and blames Mayor Tom Bradley for not giving the department "more 
support and protection." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has opened his Watts district campaign office at 11323 S. Central Ave.

CITY COUNCIL RACES 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Joy Picus has received some powerful endorsements. Democratic 
Reps. Henry Waxman and Howard Berman of Los Angeles, who head the influential 
Berman-Waxman Democratic political organization, backed her. So did council 
colleagues Richard Alatorre, Ernani Bernardi, Joan Milke Flores, Gloria Molina, 
Joel Wachs, Michael Woo and Zev Yaroslavsky. Finally, she was endorsed by two 
important city employee unions, Los Angeles Police Protective League and the 
United Paramedics of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Jeanne Nemo, who is a candidate against Picus, hopes to get some needed 
campaign financing help from a $75-per-person fund-raiser at a supporter's home 
tonight. County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who is supporting Nemo, will 
attend. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky, running for another term in the 5th District, has been endorsed by 
colleague Marvin Braude and conservation groups, including the Sierra Club, the 
Coalition for Clean Air, Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and the American 
Oceans Campaign. His political allies in the group that has fought Pacific 
Palisades oil drilling, No Oil Inc., also endorsed him, as did gay and lesbian 
community leaders, including the Municipal Elections Committee of Los Angeles 
and the San Fernando Valley Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
Woo, councilman in the 13th District, has the backing of the Sierra Club and 
the Los Angeles League of Conservation Voters.

<CORRECTION>
<P>
Based on information supplied by Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky's campaign, The 
Times erroneously reported that the Coalition For Clean Air had endorsed 
Yaroslavsky. The endorsement is from coalition Vice President Mark Abramowitz 
and not from the coalition itself. 
</P>
<P>
Based on information supplied by Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky's reelection 
campaign, The Times erroneously reported Friday that the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy had endorsed Yaroslavsky. The conservancy, as a state agency, is 
prohibited from making political endorsements and did not do so.
