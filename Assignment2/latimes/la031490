S.D. TO BOOST JAIL SECURITY IN WAKE OF 13-MAN ESCAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In the aftermath of San Diego County's biggest jailbreak, the Board of 
Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to install exterior cameras and make 
other security improvements at County Jail in Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
At the urging of Supervisor Brian Bilbray, whose district includes Chula Vista, 
the five-member board approved spending $103,000 to put alarms and wire screens 
on the jail's windows and to install security cameras. The money will also be 
used to better light jail grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, 13 inmates escaped from the jail by sawing through steel bars 
with hacksaws smuggled in through an open window, authorities said. Seven of 
the inmates -- three of whom are suspected of murder -- have yet to be 
recaptured. 
</P>
<P>
The South Bay jailbreak, coupled with a string of recent escapes from the 
poorly built El Cajon jail, also spurred board Chairman Leon Williams to draft 
a proposal asking sheriff's deputies working in the jails to identify and 
evaluate potential security deficiencies at all county detention facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Williams' proposal, which also passed unanimously, directs the Sheriff's 
Department to recommend steps the county can take to reduce the chance of 
jailbreaks. 
</P>
<P>
"This action will help us anticipate as much as we possibly can," Williams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials hope that such a priority list will help identify security problems 
-- such as those that contributed to the South Bay escape -- that otherwise 
might go undetected. 
</P>
<P>
Although problems at the El Cajon jail have been well documented -- inmates 
have been able to escape from the facility by kicking holes through the walls 
-- officials say they were unaware of security deficiencies at the South Bay 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators have determined that someone lowered hacksaws by rope from a 
public walkway 15 feet above one of the jail's windows. Authorities agree that 
without the hacksaws, the inmates could not have escaped from the jail, 
considered to be one of the county's more secure facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department had earlier requested wire mesh to cover the windows, 
but the request had gone unanswered because it was identified not as a 
necessary security improvement, but as a means of preventing pigeons from 
perching on the windows. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Griego, the county's deputy chief administrative officer, who oversees 
the general services department, said that if the need for wire mesh had been 
given "higher priority," he may have been able to persuade the county to 
finance such improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"Prioritizing security deficiencies should ensure that we get the appropriate 
responses from all government agencies," Griego said. "Hopefully, we can avoid 
a replay" of the jailbreak. 
</P>
<P>
Griego said the general services department is seeking a contractor to carry 
out the security improvements in the South Bay. The improvements should be 
completed about 90 days after a contractor is picked. Griego said he does not 
know where the financially beleaguered general services department will find 
the money to pay for the improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"That hasn't been identified yet," Griego said. "I suppose we'll have to cancel 
some future projects." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Assistant Sheriff Ken Wigginton said the department has temporarily 
hired private security guards to patrol the outside of the El Cajon and South 
Bay jails. 
</P>
<P>
But county officials reiterated their frustration Tuesday at an inability to 
tackle the jails' most serious problems: too many prisoners, not enough 
deputies. 
</P>
<P>
"The real problem is still staffing," said Supervisor Susan Golding. "And that 
can only be resolved with money . . . money that San Diego County does not 
have." 
</P>
<P>
Addressing concerns raised by his constituents, Bilbray asked that the work 
schedule of sheriff's deputies assigned to the jails be reviewed. He said he is 
concerned that deputies' shifts may be too long and affect performance. 
</P>
<P>
According to Wigginton, deputies in the jails work the following schedule: five 
12-hour days, followed by five days off; then two 12-hour days, followed by two 
days off. The schedule then repeats. 
</P>
<P>
Although Wigginton said the department would be willing to reevaluate deputies' 
hours, he said understaffing necessitates such a schedule. He said the schedule 
also allows deputies a block of time away from the stressful job. 
</P>
<P>
"The deputies did have 8 1/2-hour days, but would end up working 10- to 12-hour 
days anyway because we're so understaffed," Wigginton said. "They also had two 
days off, but would often get called in on one of those two days. That's why we 
switched. We believe the current schedule is better." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Department officials consider escapee Christopher Bell, 21, the most 
dangerous of the seven men still at large. Bell is charged with robbery and 
assault and is considered the key suspect in the October slaying of a La Mesa 
man who was kidnaped at an automatic teller machine and slain execution-style. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities also describe escapees Audias Gomez, 36, and Sergio Martinez, 22 -- 
awaiting trial on murder charges -- as "very dangerous."

SEA WORLD DOWN TO 3 WHALES AS KNOOTKA DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of Sea World's three adult killer whales died Tuesday after a four-month 
battle with a rare fungal infection, the aquatic theme park announced. 
</P>
<P>
According to Jim Antrim, Sea World's senior curator of marine mammals, Knootka, 
an 8,500-pound killer whale in her mid- to late 20s, stopped breathing in the 
park's breeding and research pool at 4:50 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
In December, Knootka became the first whale to receive itraconazole, an 
experimental drug approved for human use in Europe. Last week she contracted a 
secondary bacterial infection and became anemic. 
</P>
<P>
Her death leaves the private marine park with a stable of three performing 
whales -- two adult females and Baby Shamu. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears Knootka was overwhelmed with the infections," said Jim McBain, Sea 
World staff veterinarian. "Even with the help of the medications she received, 
her immune system was unable to respond to the challenge of the fungus and 
bacteria." 
</P>
<P>
"It's never fun to lose an old friend," said Antrim, who added that instead of 
replacing Knootka with an adult whale, Sea World will focus its attention on 
its breeding program. In 4 1/2 years, he said, four calves have been born in 
the four Sea World parks. 
</P>
<P>
Knootka is the third killer whale to die at Sea World in 18 months. In August, 
1988, just three days after the birth of Baby Shamu, the baby's father, Orky, 
died of natural causes brought on by old age, the park said. At about 30, Orky 
was the oldest killer whale in captivity at the time. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1989, Baby Shamu's mother, 14-year-old Kandu, died in a freak injury 
caused when she attempted to dominate another female whale, Corky, during a 
performance. Since then, Corky has become a surrogate mother to Baby Shamu, 
also known as Orkid. 
</P>
<P>
In part, Sea World officials blame Knootka's age for her frailty, noting that 
scientific literature puts a killer whale's life expectancy at 25 to 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Age was certainly a factor in Knootka's death," McBain said. 
</P>
<P>
But Scott Trimingham, president of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, a 
nonprofit marine mammal advocacy group, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Killer whales keep dying of old age earlier and earlier at Sea World, and 
(park administrators) keep moving the life expectancy of whales down to suit 
their needs," he said, adding that whales in captivity lack adequate exercise 
and stimulation and eat an unvaried diet. "You put these killer whales in a 
tank and they start to deteriorate. It would have been healthier in the wild." 
</P>
<P>
Trimingham says killer whales can live to be 60 in the open sea. 
</P>
<P>
Sea World veterinarians dispute the belief that captivity is bad for marine 
mammals. In fact, McBain has said that if fungal infections of the type Knootka 
contracted are more common in marine parks it is because in the wild, a sickly 
animal would die of a bacterial infection long before it could develop the 
slower-acting fungal infection. 
</P>
<P>
Knootka, who had been at Sea World since 1986, hailed from the waters 
surrounding British Columbia. Before she was purchased by the San Diego park, 
she was at Marine Land in Niagara Falls, N. Y. 
</P>
<P>
During the first months of her illness, Knootka had convalesced in a pool of 
her own, while Corky and Orkid swam in a pool nearby. Veterinarians said the 
fungal infection posed no danger to the other whales, but Knootka was kept 
separate from the thriving 1,100-pound baby because she had no experience 
caring for young whales. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, however, Knootka had been reunited with Kasatka, a 14-year-old, 
4,000-pound female killer whale that was transferred to San Diego from a Sea 
World park in San Antonio. Kasatka, who had spent two years with Knootka here 
before being moved to Texas for a breeding program, became "good friends" with 
Knootka before her death, McBain said. 
</P>
<P>
Antrim said a necropsy would be performed on Knootka's body Tuesday evening to 
determine the effectiveness of the medications she received. Her skeletal 
remains will be preserved for educational purposes, he said.

SIMI POLICE SEIZE BIG CACHES FOR CASH; 
</P>
<P>
RAIDS: THE DEPARTMENT HAS COLLECTED MORE THAN $1.7 MILLION AS ITS SHARE OF DRUG 
FORFEITURE FUNDS. AND IT'S EXPECTING MUCH MORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Simi Valley Police Department, which last year was credited with the 
largest seizure of cocaine ever by law enforcement officers from Ventura 
County, has collected more than $1.7 million over the last five years as its 
share in the federal drug forfeiture program. 
</P>
<P>
Sometime in the future -- the police hope sooner rather than later -- the 
department will more than double that amount in one lump sum when it receives 
another $1.8 million already promised to it as the city's share of money seized 
from Colombian drug dealers and money launderers last summer. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the department has claims to another $4.1 million in alleged drug 
money seized during various raids in Simi Valley that is still tied up in the 
courts because of lawsuits from alleged drug dealers who claim the money 
legally belongs to them and not to the police. 
</P>
<P>
The upshot is that the Simi Valley Police Department, which is confronted by 
one of the biggest Colombian drug networks now operating in Ventura County, has 
amassed some of the most sophisticated police technology in the county for use 
in its continuing skirmishes with Simi Valley drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley Police Chief Lindsey (Paul) Miller said the city's share of drug 
forfeiture funds received so far has been used for the purchase of 9mm Baretta 
pistols and holsters for all of his department's 105 officers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the money has been spent on computers, cars and a van specially 
outfitted with sophisticated evidence-gathering equipment, including a 
fingerprint laser. He said the money is also used to pay the salaries of three 
narcotics officers and two DARE officers, who teach anti-drug classes at the 
elementary school level. 
</P>
<P>
The federal drug forfeiture program, established in 1984, allows local law 
enforcement agencies who work with federal agents to claim money and property 
seized in drug arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Police departments can receive up to 80% of the money or property they helped 
seize in narcotics raids involving federal investigations or prosecution, Lt. 
Robert Klamser said. The program requires that the money be used for law 
enforcement purposes and stipulates that it cannot be used to replace current 
city funding, Klamser said. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley, West Covina and Los Angeles police departments were among the 
first law enforcement agencies to receive money through the forfeiture program 
after a 1984 joint investigation of a cocaine ring, Klamser said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department received $1.4 million and Simi Valley and 
West Covina each received about $360,000 from that operation, according to 
police records. 
</P>
<P>
Seized assets are divided among participating agencies based on their 
participation in an investigation, Klamser said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the Port Hueneme Police Department provided a narcotics-sniffing 
dog in a Simi Valley police investigation last August that led to the largest 
seizure of cocaine ever by authorities from Ventura County -- 2,068 pounds -- 
as well as $2.4 million in suspected drug profits. 
</P>
<P>
The dog's efforts are expected to yield a substantial amount of money -- the 
exact amount is yet to be determined -- for the 21-officer department. 
</P>
<P>
Port Hueneme Sgt. Dennis Fitzgerald said a year ago that his department 
received about $16,000 in federal forfeiture funds when it sniffed out more 
than $500,000 in suspected drug profits and several kilos of cocaine as part of 
a joint investigation with the Burbank Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
The department is also expected to receive one of two small planes seized last 
year as part of a U.S. Customs Service investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"The dogs have done a real good job," Fitzgerald said, adding that his 
department recently sold one of its two German shepherds to the Ventura County 
district attorney's office. "They're definitely worth their weight." 
</P>
<P>
Klamser agreed, saying his department has plans to purchase its own trained 
police dog because of the potential revenue it could generate. 
</P>
<P>
The federal forfeiture program is not without its drawbacks. The amount of time 
it takes for a local agency to receive a disbursement of federal forfeiture 
funds could take anywhere from a couple of months to a couple of years, Klamser 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, the larger the amount, the longer the wait," he said, noting that 
the department's claim of $4.1 million is still pending in court. 
</P>
<P>
In cases where the amounts of drug assets seized are less than $100,000, the 
federal agency involved, usually the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, is 
allowed to decide how much to return to local authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The state has a similar forfeiture program, but until recently it was easier 
for local law enforcement agencies to recoup a larger share of drug monies 
under the federal law, Klamser said. 
</P>
<P>
The main reason was that the state law made it more difficult to seize property 
and required that the majority of drug money go to mental health and anti-drug 
education programs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the state law was amended in January, 1989, making it easier for law 
enforcement agencies to seize cash and other property believed to be the 
proceeds of drug dealing, said Ronald Janes, major crimes and narcotics 
supervisor with the Ventura County district attorney's office. The statute also 
no longer requires prosecutors to obtain criminal convictions before 
confiscating these items, Janes said. 
</P>
<P>
The new state law allocates about 85% of suspected drug profits to the police 
agency participating in the narcotics investigation, with the remainder going 
to the prosecuting agency and the state. 
</P>
<P>
Since the law was amended, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of 
local law enforcement agencies using it, Janes said. 
</P>
<P>
"We now have two attorneys who do nothing but forfeiture cases," he said.

12-HOUR FIRE DESTROYS CRATE WAREHOUSE NORTH OF OXNARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A spectacular fire Tuesday destroyed a warehouse just north of Oxnard filled 
with wax-coated cardboard strawberry crates. 
</P>
<P>
The fire produced billowing black smoke visible over much of the county. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, which apparently started near wooden pallets stacked in the warehouse 
on Montgomery Avenue near Vineyard Avenue, was already burning to the ceiling 
of the structure by the time firefighters arrived, said Chief John Asselin of 
the Ventura County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze took almost 12 hours to extinguish because the walls of the 
20,000-square-foot corrugated steel structure collapsed shortly after 
firefighters arrived, trapping hundreds of green plastic strawberry containers 
and wax-coated cardboard boxes, Asselin said. 
</P>
<P>
"Primarily the waxes and plastics were causing it to burn with great 
intensity," Asselin said. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported, said Fire Department spokesman Jim Renshaw. 
</P>
<P>
Nine engines, three trucks and nearly 60 firefighters battled the three-alarm 
blaze at its height about 3:30 a.m., Asselin said. A strike team of five 
additional engines was also called to the scene, firefighters said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, firefighters summoned the county's hazardous materials unit 
because of a potential hazard from propane stored in a nearby warehouse, 
Asselin said. However, firefighters were able to contain the blaze, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Ferro, a general partner for Seacoast Associates, owners of the warehouse, 
said the building was leased to two firms, DP Enterprises, a company that 
stored vegetables and flowers for shipping, and the Bryant Roofing Co. Ferro 
had no dollar estimate of damage, but said the building was "a total loss." 
</P>
<P>
Several warehouse employees were near the building when the fire started, 
Renshaw said. One employee attempted to put out the blaze with a fire hose 
before the Fire Department was called, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the blaze was under investigation, Renshaw said.

MOORPARK COUNCIL PLACES HOTEL PROPOSAL ON REVIEW 'FAST TRACK'; 
</P>
<P>
GROWTH: THE CITY AND THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AGREE THAT MOORPARK NEEDS A HOTEL. 
THE PROJECT COULD BE APPROVED WITHIN A YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Moorpark business owners have been talking about getting a hotel for the 
community for nearly two years, and now officials say the end is in sight. 
</P>
<P>
The wheels were put in motion for Moorpark's first hotel when the City Council 
unanimously supported a "fast-track" review for the project, which could be 
completed in a year. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, businesses must house out-of-town clients and visitors in Thousand 
Oaks or Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel project, planned for the northeast corner of Spring Road and Flinn 
Avenue, has not yet come before the Moorpark City Council for a formal public 
hearing and thus has not yet been approved. 
</P>
<P>
The council, however, has permitted the developer to apply for a 
conditional-use permit, which would allow the hotel to be built on 
industrial-zoned property. Because the hotel would benefit industry, a general 
plan amendment and zone change to commercial use was not considered necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"The council is very anxious that this be expedited," said Councilwoman Eloise 
Brown. "We have no hotel in this city . . . It's essentially something the city 
lacks that would make it a whole city." 
</P>
<P>
For large companies such as Litton Systems, which has a division in Moorpark, 
the proposed hotel would be a welcome addition to the community. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of customers and people we're constantly training, and we're 
always looking for a hotel to put them in," said Richard Cameron, a company 
vice president. Litton may house up to 30 people a week in Thousand Oaks or 
Simi Valley, Cameron said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Chamber of Commerce was very much behind the idea, and each councilperson 
has received a lot of positive public input," said Moorpark Mayor Paul 
Lawrason. 
</P>
<P>
Increased traffic, he conceded, would be a "big consideration," and the project 
would have to be "very, very carefully designed." 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark's residents as well as its business community would benefit from a new 
hotel, said Linda Plaks, president of Moorpark's Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"Residents will have a place to send Aunt Grace when she comes in for 
Thanksgiving," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Plaks emphasized that the decision to bring a hotel into Moorpark was not made 
lightly. 
</P>
<P>
"For the last two years, the Economic Development Committee, which is made up 
of city officials and Chamber of Commerce members, has been looking for the 
right kind of complex," she said. "It's not like they just came out three 
months ago and said, 'Let's build a hotel here.' " 
</P>
<P>
According to Stan Cohen, who represents the Channel Islands Hotel Group, the 
three-story, 135-unit Country Inn would cost about $8 million to $9 million to 
build, including a proposed adjoining restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel and restaurant would be built on half of a 7-acre site purchased 
about seven months ago by Martin Smith and Associates of Oxnard, the hotel 
firm's parent company. 
</P>
<P>
The company also is applying for a permit to build 60 apartments on the 
remaining 3 1/2 acres, but that project is undergoing a more extensive and 
lengthy application process. 
</P>
<P>
So far, about $2 million has been invested in the hotel project, including the 
purchase of the land, Cohen said. The chain of Country Inn hotels caters 
primarily to business people, with rooms averaging about $69 a night, he said. 
There are nine Country Inn hotels in Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara 
counties, including two in Camarillo.

INSURANCE FIRM RECONSIDERING PREVIOUS SETTLEMENT AFTER BOY'S SHOOTING DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The family of an 8-year-old Imperial Beach boy who died a week ago after he was 
accidentally shot in a neighbor's house might not receive a $225,000 settlement 
from an insurance company for injuries the boy suffered in a car accident more 
than two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Charles B. Pederson, a La Jolla attorney representing the parents of the child, 
Richard Krecklow II, said Tuesday that the day before the boy was shot, his 
parents had accepted an offer from State Farm Insurance to settle the auto 
accident case. 
</P>
<P>
But the insurance company, the lawyer said, has told him it is reevaluating the 
settlement because the boy is dead and because the settlement was never 
approved in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Pederson said that, although the agreement was not in writing, it is not 
unusual to handle personal-injury settlements over the phone. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at a classical loophole, and they're trying to take advantage of 
it," he said. "We had a binding agreement, and they reconfirmed it." 
</P>
<P>
State Farm representatives refused to comment on the case. But the San Diego 
Tribune reported Tuesday that Maureen Lough, a State Farm claims supervisor, 
challenged the accuracy of reports that the boy's family was told their claim 
was no longer valid. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 7, 1987, Krecklow was struck by a car while in a crosswalk at 3rd and K 
streets in Chula Vista, Pederson said. The child was cut and bruised and had 
scars over much of his body after being dragged 120 feet. The driver was 
insured by State Farm. 
</P>
<P>
A personal-injury claim was under negotiation for the past six months, 
according to Pederson. An offer from the insurance company, calling for 
payments over 22 years, was made in late February and was accepted by Richard 
and Cynthia Krecklow on March 5. 
</P>
<P>
However, on March 6, their son and a 10-year-old girl were looking at guns in a 
back bedroom of the girl's home in the 500 block of 10th Street in Imperial 
Beach when a .22-caliber rifle was fired, wounding the boy in the head. He died 
a day later. 
</P>
<P>
After the death, a claims adjuster for the insurance company called, offered 
her condolences, and reconfirmed the settlement, Pederson said. 
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, however, she told the family that State Farm was reconsidering 
the settlement and might not pay, Pederson said. She said an attorney had told 
the company it did not have to pay because the boy had died and that the 
settlement had not been approved in Superior Court. According to state law, a 
monetary settlement to a minor must be approved by a Superior Court judge, 
Pederson said. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Pinsky, a Solana Beach attorney who specializes in personal-injury 
accidents, said such settlements are typically negotiated over the phone and 
are finalized when the claims adjuster sends the attorney representing the 
injured party a check and a release form. 
</P>
<P>
"A draft or check and a release form is sent to the lawyer with the 
understanding that before the funds are disbursed, the victim will sign a 
release form which releases the driver from further legal action and accepts 
the draft as a final settlement," he said. "A deal is a deal." 
</P>
<P>
Pinsky said he was speaking generally about personal-injury cases, and did not 
refer specifically to the Krecklow matter. 
</P>
<P>
If State Farm decides not to pay the settlement, Pederson said, he will 
petition the court to enforce the verbal agreement made with the family. 
</P>
<P>
Pederson said the family is "shocked and upset about State Farm's decision, but 
the scope of what happened to Richard pales in comparison."

SENTENCING SET IN SEXUAL ASSAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Ventura Superior Court judge has set April 13 for the sentencing of an avowed 
white supremacist from Simi Valley who was convicted of sexually assaulting and 
beating a friend of his estranged wife. 
</P>
<P>
Guy Leroy Pederson, 29, will face a maximum sentence of 69 years in prison, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
A jury found him guilty of 10 felony counts, including eight counts of forcible 
sexual assault. Judge Lawrence Storch will impose the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors argued that Pederson repeatedly assaulted a 26-year-old Silver 
Strand Beach woman in her apartment to retaliate against his estranged wife, 
whom he thought had burglarized his home and taken his gun. 
</P>
<P>
The defense admitted that Pederson struck the woman once but denied the sexual 
assaults. 
</P>
<P>
During pretrial hearings, Pederson acknowledged that he is a white supremacist. 
</P>
<P>
His first attorney was allowed to withdraw from the case after being threatened 
by anonymous telephone callers who said he would be harmed if Pederson was not 
acquitted.

TEACHERS DELAY VOTE ON CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura Unified School District teachers delayed a vote Tuesday on a proposed 
three-year contract that could have ended nearly 11 months of negotiations in 
Ventura County's third-largest school district. 
</P>
<P>
District and union negotiating teams reached a tentative agreement March 1, and 
teachers were set to vote Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But a problem with a computer delayed printing and distribution of the contract 
proposal, said Dr. Richard Averett, district manager of personnel services, at 
a board meeting Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless we have the contract in front of us, there is really no reason to go 
ahead and vote on it," said Pam Mortensen, a teachers union representative. 
</P>
<P>
Officials refused to discuss specifics of the contract affecting about 660 
teachers in the 15,000-student district. However, in what appears to be a major 
concession, union representatives have apparently agreed to have teachers pay 
part of the cost of health benefits for retired teachers. KEN McALPINE

FIRM TO ASK COUNCIL TO RECONSIDER HOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK BARRS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An attorney for Karcher-Barry Enterprises, whose 150-room hotel project was 
rejected by the Ventura City Council, said Tuesday the development group plans 
to again submit the project for city approval. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very disappointed with the council's decision, and, at this point, 
refiling seems the most likely option," said Allen F. Camp, the developer's 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the council turned down the project, after its members argued that a 
large hotel would be inappropriate while Ventura struggles with a 
water-shortage emergency. Council members also said the city should hold out 
for a better project. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is an extremely sensitive site, and we have to be very careful 
with what goes in there," said Councilwoman Cathy Bean. 
</P>
<P>
Karcher-Barry had proposed building the hotel next to the North Bank Plaza 
development, just west of the Ventura Freeway, near the Ventura Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
After appeals from Camp and Karl Karcher, who owns the Carl's Jr. fast-food 
restaurant chain and is a partner in the development firm, the council voted to 
follow the recommendation of its planning staff and turn down the project. 
Councilman Jim Monahan cast the only vote in favor of the development. 
</P>
<P>
After the denial, Camp and Karcher stepped up to the speakers' microphone and 
blasted the council's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel there's a changing political wind in the council," Camp said, referring 
to the January election that swept three slow-growth councilmen into office. 
"My client has been a victim of these changes." 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like a football that just got kicked around," added Karcher, featured 
in Carl's Jr. television commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman John McWherter fired back: "In my 17 years as a city councilman, 
this is the first time I've been rebutted after a vote." RICK BARRS

WORDS, FISTS FLY AT PANEL MEETING IN N. HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A meeting of the North Hollywood Redevelopment committee ended in chaos Tuesday 
night after two committee members walked out to protest what they called 
"tainted elections," the chairwoman launched into a tirade and fistfights broke 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Participants said the bitterness surrounded the elections for nine vacant seats 
on the committee and a dispute over whether the proceedings would be recorded 
by a video camera. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting, called to hold the elections, was hostile from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Chairwoman Ada Klevens shouted at Brad Berlin, a Pasadena law clerk, that 
"people like you are rabble-rousers" when Berlin tried to protest a February 
committee election of members. 
</P>
<P>
Berlin maintained that the committee violated state rules by failing to 
properly publicize the election. 
</P>
<P>
Several times Berlin tried to interrupt, but Klevens shouted: "I'm talking, and 
you're going to listen or you're going to leave." 
</P>
<P>
Berlin said, "Madame Chairman, you're breaking the law." 
</P>
<P>
"So sue me," she replied. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before that, committee member David Gerred walked out, saying, "I will 
have no part in tainted elections." He was followed by committee member Diana 
Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
Deprived of a quorum, the committee was unable to proceed with the scheduled 
election of additional members by those at the meeting, who, to be eligible to 
vote, were supposed to live in North Hollywood or have a business there. 
</P>
<P>
Arguments over who met the eligibility requirements began early in the meeting 
and continued after it broke down. 
</P>
<P>
A North Hollywood businessman swung at a man videotaping the proceedings and 
knocked the camera to the ground, participants said. 
</P>
<P>
"No one went down, and no blood was drawn," said Jerry Belcher, a CRA project 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
Several persons intervened and "cooler heads prevailed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In another fight, Greg Roberts, who identified himself as an unsuccessful 
candidate for one of the committee seats, said he was punched in the stomach. 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood Division Police Lt. Stuart Maislin said assault complaints were 
brought by Roberts and by Scott Halper, who alleged that his camera was knocked 
to the ground as he was videotaping the disorder. 
</P>
<P>
Maislin said detectives would investigate the complaints today. 
</P>
<P>
The committee usually acts as an advisory board to the North Hollywood 
Community Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Berlin and other critics have charged that the Community Redevelopment Agency 
has tried to pack the citizens advisory committee with members who will give 
rubber-stamp endorsements to its plans. 
</P>
<P>
Belcher responded that there is "absolutely no truth" in the charges. 
</P>
<P>
The 740-acre North Hollywood redevelopment area is bordered roughly by Tujunga 
Avenue on the west, Cahuenga Boulevard on the east, Hatteras street on the 
north and Camarillo street on the south. 
</P>
<P>
The redevelopment area, the only one in the San Fernando Valley, is the third 
largest in Los Angeles, ranking behind the downtown central business district 
and the Hollywood zone.

HOUSE PANEL WILL STUDY LAND SWAPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two proposed and disputed land swaps within the Santa Monica Mountains National 
Recreation Area will be the focus of a May 1 congressional subcommittee hearing 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The House Committee on Government Operations' subcommittee on the environment, 
energy and natural resources will review potential exchanges involving 
federally owned land in Cheeseboro Canyon and Elsmere Canyon, a senior 
committee staffer said. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the hearing, which is expected to be the first in a series, will 
be to assess whether proper procedures exist within the departments of the 
Interior and Agriculture to properly consider proposed intrastate land swaps 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to look at the standards that are used to make intrastate 
exchanges," said the aide, who spoke on condition that he not be named. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the General Accounting Office, Congress' research arm, "has 
consistently pointed out that there is a deficiency in the kind of written 
procedure and practice" on previous land-swap deals. However, he added, the 
selection of the proposed Los Angeles-area land swaps does not mean that the 
subcommittee has found problems with them.

BUSINESSMAN MAY SUE OVER GAS STORAGE 
</P>

<P>
A Santa Paula businessman may file a lawsuit in a bid to overturn approval by 
the City Council of a neighbor's request to store propane tanks on his 
property, a lawyer said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The council endorsed the request of Empire Gas Co., which operates in the 
Lemonwood Industrial Park, at a meeting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Atherton, who owns adjacent property, has claimed that a city ordinance 
outlaws the storage of explosive materials and petroleum products -- which 
include propane -- in the area. Atherton said Empire Gas' plans would 
jeopardize his plans to develop his land. 
</P>
<P>
Marc L. Charney, attorney for Empire, now based in Oxnard, minimized potential 
hazards at a council meeting Monday. He said service stations have been 
permitted in similar zones. Charney said propane is less dangerous than 
gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
"An explosion is unlikely because propane is heavy and disperses quickly," 
Charney said. He noted that the Empire Gas facility is "95% complete" and urged 
the council to permit the company to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Phillip H. Romney said Tuesday that propane storage violates no 
ordinance because the council chose to allow the use through approval of a 
conditional use permit. 
</P>
<P>
The council, in endorsing earlier action by the city Planning Commission, 
closed off any further possibility of appeals within the city. 
</P>
<P>
Atherton's lawyer, W. Stephen Onstot, said his client is considering a lawsuit 
to challenge the city action. 
</P>
<P>
According to Onstot, the Empire Gas operation, which would store propane for RV 
tanks and home delivery, originally applied for heavy manufacturing zoning. He 
said the city was using a conditional use permit where a zone change from 
manufacturing to heavy manufacturing was required. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to be an expert," Onstot told council members, "just read the 
ordinance." 
</P>
<P>
Atherton, who hopes to build a facility on the adjacent property, said propane 
storage next door would limit the sorts of businesses that could rent. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not sure what we're going to do," Onstot said, "but the matter isn't 
over yet." JANET BERGAMO

VANISHED: A RETIREE WHOSE DREAM WAS TO TRAVEL DISAPPEARS IN OREGON. A COUPLE IS 
CHARGED WITH USING HIS BANK ACCOUNT AND VEHICLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gordy Johnson had looked forward for years to his retirement. Every detail was 
carefully planned, meticulously researched. 
</P>
<P>
A bachelor, the former Glendale banking accountant would sell his home of 27 
years and the old, beat-up green Volkswagen that he had driven to work, day in 
and day out. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from his life's labor would be invested in a $219,000 luxury motor 
home with a new four-wheel-drive Suzuki towed behind. After a career marked by 
punctuality, Johnson looked forward to a nomadic life without a timetable. 
</P>
<P>
When he retired last April, just after his 62nd birthday, his co-workers at a 
Glendale Federal Bank subsidiary presented him with a mixed black and brown 
Labrador-shepherd puppy to keep him company in his travels. He named the pup 
Rocky. 
</P>
<P>
After making several short treks in his new rig, Johnson telephoned relatives 
on Oct. 14 from Bend, Ore., saying that he was headed south to visit a friend 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the last anyone ever saw of him or heard from him again," said Sgt. 
Robert Cosner of the Deschutes County Sheriff's Department in Oregon. "He has 
disappeared from the face of the Earth." 
</P>
<P>
A month after relatives notified authorities, Gordon Theodore Johnson -- born 
April 15, 1927; 5-foot-9; 170 pounds; fair complexion; balding black hair; blue 
eyes -- officially became a missing person. 
</P>
<P>
He is among 21,996 missing adults on the computerized nationwide list 
maintained by the National Crime Information Center of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation in Washington. Since the list was established in 1975, 9,244 
adults -- less than 30% -- have been found, dead or alive. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson's is not a typical missing-person case. A couple has been arrested 
in Las Vegas in the possession of Johnson's vehicles and most of the missing 
man's savings account -- partly spent on a trip to Tahiti, lavish clothes and 
gambling in Las Vegas, according to court papers filed by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
Because no body has been found, authorities are not openly calling the Johnson 
case a slaying. But they also do not speak optimistically of locating Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"I have grave concerns about whether we will ever find Mr. Johnson," said Dick 
Whitaker, supervising special FBI agent in Las Vegas, where the couple was 
arrested March 1. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-foot-long motor home was found Jan. 29 parked in a trailer vacation 
resort in Surprise, Ariz., just five miles outside Phoenix. Investigators said 
Johnson's bank account is virtually depleted. The Suzuki was recovered when FBI 
agents arrested the couple. Authorities have no clue to the whereabouts of 
Johnson and Rocky. 
</P>
<P>
The couple being held without bail in a Clark County, Nev., jail, are Stanley 
Alan Hershey, 46, and his companion, Jan Vicki Fine, 37, who had used a Santa 
Monica address, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Hershey and Fine reportedly have denied knowing Johnson and have refused to 
talk to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
They have been charged in U.S. District Court in Nevada with relatively minor 
crimes -- illegal use of a banking card and transportation of a stolen vehicle 
across state lines. 
</P>
<P>
However, Assistant U.S. Atty. Gregory Damm charged that the suspects 
"definitely had something to do with the disappearance of the victim." A 
federal magistrate ordered them held without bail after Damm argued that the 
pair pose a danger because of the potential seriousness of the crime and may 
flee prosecution if released. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Those familiar with the case admit privately that they suspect Johnson was 
killed. But they have no clues as to when or where Johnson may have met foul 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Cosner, the Oregon sheriff who took the missing-person report, is still 
pursuing the case. He said he has drawn his own conclusions. "A man doesn't 
save all his money to retire, then just give away a $220,000 coach, his motor 
vehicle and his bank account. Everybody who has ever looked at this case knows 
what we're talking about." 
</P>
<P>
However, because there is no body, Cosner says, his department must treat the 
case as a missing-persons investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's relatives -- including his sister, brother and sister-in-law in 
Minneapolis and a close-knit family of nieces, nephews and their children -- 
are trying to remain optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't help but be apprehensive, but we have to keep our hopes up," said Del 
Johnson, 51, Johnson's brother. "Until we learn differently, we believe he is 
somewhere and not able to contact us. We just keep praying." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, investigations into Johnson's disappearance are complicated by 
jurisdictional problems. Federal and local authorities in a half-dozen states 
-- where checks were issued on Johnson's bank funds or cash withdrawn from his 
account on automated-teller machines -- are involved in the Johnson case. 
Officials are tight-lipped about details because investigations are continuing. 
</P>
<P>
Whitaker, of the FBI in Las Vegas, said: "We are not conducting a murder 
investigation. One of the main problems is, who would have jurisdiction? Bend, 
Ore., is still conducting a missing-persons investigation." 
</P>
<P>
But Cosner said his Oregon-based investigation is limited by a tight county 
budget in the economically depressed region. "We can't just fly here and there 
to chase a case," he said. "We have to rely on help from other agencies. It 
takes time to put it all together." 
</P>
<P>
He credited the Las Vegas FBI office as being "very helpful and cooperative. 
Somebody had to take the ball and run with it. Not all agencies are willing to 
do that." 
</P>
<P>
Murder is not a federal offense unless kidnaping is involved. Because no body 
has been found in the Johnson case and there is no evidence of a kidnaping, 
such an investigation is outside the official jurisdiction of the FBI, Whitaker 
said. However, he said, agents are retracing the trails of suspects in the 
hopes of finding Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's relatives said they were concerned but not alarmed when the retired 
accountant failed to call them from Los Angeles. They still set aside their 
concerns when they didn't hear from Johnson at Thanksgiving, when the nomadic 
bachelor had considered visiting friends in South Carolina. "He just wanted to 
go hither, there and yon," Del Johnson said. "That was his thing. Gordy said he 
wanted to be 'just like a turtle, with my home on my back.' " 
</P>
<P>
By early December, Johnson's relatives said, they could no longer suppress 
their anxieties. They opened Johnson's November banking statement that had been 
sent to his sister and discovered, among other things, a canceled check for 
$6,100 to a Louisiana travel agency, dated Oct. 15, one day after Johnson's 
disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
They found that the check had been issued to pay for tickets to Tahiti for a 
man identified as Hershey. Relatives contacted sheriff's deputies in Bend, 
where Johnson was last seen, and an investigation began. 
</P>
<P>
Cosner said he learned that the tickets, sent to an address in Surprise were 
used by Hershey and Fine. Further investigation indicated that other checks had 
been issued to pay bills not owed by Johnson, and that cash was being withdrawn 
from Johnson's bank account from automated-teller machines, Cosner said. 
</P>
<P>
In all, up to $160,000 -- Johnson's entire cash nest egg -- is believed to have 
been embezzled from his account, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
According to family and friends, Johnson is a kind and considerate man who kept 
in touch with his Midwestern family and went out of his way to brighten the 
office for co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a very careful and meticulous worker," said Rochelle Gnatz, Johnson's 
last supervisor at Glenfed Development in Encino, where he worked as an 
accounts payable assistant. His career had involved accounting jobs at various 
Los Angeles firms, including Glenfed during the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson frequently marked holidays by bestowing gifts on co-workers. One Easter 
he gave giant stuffed lions taller than a desk to each of the women in his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
He distributed Christmas towels and potholders and remembered birthdays. "He 
was the only one who did it," said Mary Anne Paul, a former Glenfed employee 
who was Johnson's supervisor. "He was just a saint, a very warm and loving and 
friendly and outgoing and generous man." 
</P>
<P>
He was generous at home, too. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson had allowed an acquaintance, a Vietnam veteran, to stay at his home, 
even though the man was prone to nightmares that prompted him to punch holes in 
most of the interior doors of the house, friends and neighbors said. He also 
had provided shelter recently for a woman who he said had fallen on hard times, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors described Johnson as a loner who never caused complaints or hosted 
loud parties. 
</P>
<P>
He had done little to maintain his house since he purchased it new in 1962. The 
elaborate fireplace was never used, the drab brown paint had faded and the 
wooden shingles were deteriorated when Gay Faylor purchased the property last 
August at a "fixer-upper" price of $385,000. The white carpeting was clean but 
badly worn, Faylor said. 
</P>
<P>
Friends and co-workers said Johnson was an avid backgammon player and often 
traveled to Las Vegas, Reno and Lake Tahoe to participate in tournaments, 
frequently winning large sums of money. 
</P>
<P>
He also occasionally worked as a dealer for gaming night parties, said Al Bond, 
owner of Big Al's Game Rental in South Pasadena, who described Johnson as "a 
very quiet individual who didn't drink or smoke." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson kept all of his personal and financial papers neatly packed in one 
place -- in a camera-bag-like satchel that he always carried with him, friends 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a sweet, kind, loving guy," one business associate said. "He trusted 
people."

PASADENA DRUG-TESTING POLICY FACES TOUGH TIME WITH LABOR; 
</P>
<P>
WORKPLACE: UNIONS OBJECT TO RANDOM TESTING AND SEARCHES. CITY OFFICIALS CLAIM 
THEY ARE ON SOLID LEGAL GROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Pasadena's new drug-testing policy will face its own test this month when four 
labor unions, all with strong objections to the policy, begin contract 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Union leaders for city firefighters, police officers, trash collectors and 
clerical employees oppose key sections of the proposed policy, which could 
eventually affect the city's 1,200 unionized employees. The policy was 
implemented in January for 400 non-union and management employees. 
</P>
<P>
Objections center on sections that give supervisors the right to order 
employees to take drug detection tests, to search employee desks and file 
cabinets, and to call in police to search private storage lockers. Another 
section opposed by the unions requires employees to snitch on colleagues who 
violate the policy. Another section abolishes the two-martini business lunch by 
forbidding city employees to drink alcohol during meal periods. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said no employees have been tested or subjected to the 
provisions of the new policy, but union criticism of the plan is running high. 
</P>
<P>
The policy is "trampling on individual rights and freedoms," said Dennis Diaz, 
president of the Pasadena Police Officers Assn. "It's too broad and too vague." 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting to be more of a Big Brother watching you," said Linda Cox, 
president of the Pasadena Assn. of Clerical and Technical Employees. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena's policy is far more stringent than those in other California cities 
and might even be unconstitutional, said Glen Rothner, a Los Angeles attorney 
who represents the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees 
in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials contend that the policy conforms to recent court rulings on 
privacy issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Our own legal staff has indicated we're on safe ground," said Pasadena 
Personnel Director Ramon Curiel. 
</P>
<P>
"The policy isn't too much different from what we've done in the past," added 
Dorothy Kirkland, the city's employee relations coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
The policy was written after city officials last year hired a private firm, 
Confidential Management Services Inc. of San Dimas, to investigate allegations 
of drug use and theft by Department of Water and Power employees at the city 
maintenance yard on Mountain Street. Twenty employees quit or were fired, 11 
others were suspended, and two received salary reductions as a result of the 
investigation. There were no arrests, however. 
</P>
<P>
To prevent such problems in the future, the city devised a drug policy that 
explicitly states what is expected of employees. It took effect in January for 
non-union employees and for all city job applicants, who must submit to a drug 
test before employment. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city has the power to unilaterally impose the policy on its 
unionized employees, city officials decided instead to meet with union 
representatives to try to persuade them to accept the drug policy provisions, 
Kirkland said. However, if an impasse is reached, city officials could ask the 
city Board of Directors to allow them to implement the policy without union 
consent. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor William Thomson said the board has not considered the policy because of 
the pending negotiations. He called the policy a "management issue." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "We do not see that it would violate the rights of the employee, but 
it certainly is a matter to be negotiated with the various organizations." 
</P>
<P>
City officials may find themselves arguing the same points over and over again 
with each union. "All of us disagree with the city about the same things," 
clerical union President Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
The main disagreement is with a provision allowing the city to search -- 
without employee consent -- desks, file cabinets and city-owned cars used by 
employees. Under the policy, supervisors may summon police officers to search 
lockers assigned for employees' personal use, but they must follow privacy 
laws, including obtaining search warrants when the circumstances require it. 
</P>
<P>
That section violates rights specifically guaranteed to public employees under 
the U.S. and California constitutions, argued labor attorney Rothner, who said 
public employees have a right of privacy for personal storage spaces under a 
1987 U.S. Supreme Court ruling. In that case, a state hospital employee in 
Napa, Calif., was fired after hospital officials obtained evidence of 
work-related misconduct when they searched his locked file cabinets. The court 
held that public employees are protected by the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution, which bans unreasonable searches and seizures. 
</P>
<P>
"There has to be some suspected misconduct on the part of a particular employee 
before that employee's privacy can be invaded," Rothner said. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena's policy also ignores language regulating locker searches for law 
enforcement officers spelled out in state Government Code sections informally 
known as the "Officers' Bill of Rights," said Diaz of the police labor group. 
"Pasadena's policy kind of steps over that," Diaz said. 
</P>
<P>
Union representatives also object to a requirement that city employees, when 
ordered by a supervisor, must submit to a urine, breath or blood test. Failure 
to comply is considered insubordination and will result in disciplinary action. 
</P>
<P>
"Any supervisor at any time could send someone to be drug tested," said 
Annemarie Galasso, business representative for the International Brotherhood of 
Electrical Workers. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors should not have the sole responsibility of determining when a drug 
test should be given, Galasso said. The city should use objective measures, 
such as skill tests patterned after roadside sobriety tests and physical 
examinations by doctors, to determine whether emotional problems, medication or 
illness may be causing symptoms similar to drug abuse, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Other controversial sections are those requiring city employees to either 
report a drug-abusing colleague to supervisors or to "take other appropriate 
action," such as preventing the employee from working while under the 
influence. Kirkland said an employee who fails to do so could be disciplined, 
especially if an on-the-job accident occurs. 
</P>
<P>
Rothner said he believes the section is unique to Pasadena and poses legal, 
practical and philosophical problems. It turns the "entire work force into 
informants and snitches," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Cox objected to another section that prohibits employees from possessing or 
using alcohol during meal periods. "I don't like the city telling me what I can 
and can't do while I'm off work," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In these sections, Pasadena has jumped ahead of case law and other California 
cities, which have proceeded more cautiously with their policies, especially in 
the area of searches, labor union officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"For the most part, cities have been quite restrained in these areas," Rothner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
JoAnne Spears, general counsel for the League of California Cities in 
Sacramento, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"My impression is the emphasis has mostly been on the testing issues and less 
attention has been paid to the search issues," Spears said. 
</P>
<P>
Among cities in Southern California, Los Angeles has taken a cautious approach, 
said Assistant City Atty. Leslie E. Brown, who is working on the city's drug 
policy. The city tests job applicants for "safety sensitive" jobs and is 
devising rules for testing current employees, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
David Jacobs, Pasadena's risk management director who helped write the city's 
policy, said it focuses on creating a safe environment for city employees and 
the public. "We're certainly trying to be on the cutting edge because we think 
this is such a serious problem." 
</P>
<P>
While the city has a program to assist employees who have drug problems, Jacobs 
said the low success rate of such programs prompted the city to adopt what he 
called a "very realistic policy." 
</P>
<P>
"If you have a drug problem, we don't want you on the work site," he said.

LAND FOR COURTHOUSE IDENTIFIED; 
</P>
<P>
WEST VALLEY: A DEVELOPER SAYS HE IS TALKING WITH THE COUNTY. BUT CHATSWORTH 
NEIGHBORS OPPOSE REMOVING THE LAND FROM INDUSTRIAL USE.

Los Angeles County officials are negotiating with developer Alexander Haagen to 
buy a parcel of land at the southeast corner of Winnetka Avenue and Plummer 
Street in Chatsworth for a new courthouse, Haagen confirmed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Haagen, a prominent Southern California retail developer and one-time president 
of the Los Angeles Coliseum Commission, said he has proposed selling the county 
the 9.3-acre parcel. County officials want to build a municipal courthouse to 
serve the west San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Quist, deputy administrator for the Los Angeles Municipal Court, could 
not be reached for comment Tuesday. But Quist on Monday refused to discuss 
specific sites or confirm that the county was looking at the Haagen property. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a plan, and we're not prepared to go public until we have a plan 
that we're ready to discuss with the court and the judges," Quist said. Last 
week, Quist confirmed the county is negotiating with an owner of a site of 
about 10 acres in the Chatsworth industrial area. 
</P>
<P>
Haagen, in an interview Tuesday, said he is seeking to sell his parcel in that 
area to the county. 
</P>
<P>
"We understand the county is evaluating various proposals, hopefully including 
ours," Haagen said. 
</P>
<P>
Haagen said he responded last year to a county request for a "turnkey" 
courthouse project, or one in which the county would obtain the land along with 
the completed building. 
</P>
<P>
He did not disclose an asking price for the project. County budget plans have 
estimated its total cost at $36.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
Haagen bought the property last December from Santa Fe Pacific Realty Co. for 
about $9.5 million, according to Joe Kraus, an industrial real estate agent who 
handled the sale. 
</P>
<P>
The county's interest in Haagen's Chatsworth property has been common knowledge 
among industrial realtors for months, said Tim Foutz, an industrial real estate 
analyst. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, opposition from the residential area north of Plummer Street 
is beginning to surface. Harry Godley said he and his neighbors want the land 
used according to its industrial zoning. The land is currently zoned for 
manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
Court officials have said the new courthouse, no matter where it is, would 
handle misdemeanor and felony criminal cases and would have a modern detention 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Among Godley's neighbors, "We didn't find one that voiced anything favorable 
towards it," he said. "They thought it would be a detriment to the community. 
They felt that property values would drop in time." 
</P>
<P>
Godley said his group has voiced its opposition to Los Angeles City Councilman 
Hal Bernson, who represents the area. A Bernson spokeswoman said the councilman 
has no comment because the county has not told him of any proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Quist said he expects to meet with Bernson next week. 
</P>
<P>
Haagen, a major contributor to city and county campaigns, has done business 
with the county before. In 1987, Haagen made a profit of at least $9 million 
when he sold the county the former Western headquarters of Sears in Alhambra. 
The county bought the 12-story building without having advertised its need for 
the space. 
</P>
<P>
Quist has said the proposed new courthouse, which would be two to three stories 
high, would open sometime in the mid-1990s to serve the West Valley's growing 
population.

BATTLE LINES FORM OVER DUMPING SLUDGE; 
</P>
<P>
ANTELOPE VALLEY: OFFICIALS SAY THEY WEREN'T TOLD OF A PROPOSAL TO FERTILIZE 
FIELDS WITH TREATED SEWAGE. 
</P>

County Supervisor Mike Antonovich said Tuesday he will oppose a plan by the 
city of Los Angeles to spread hundreds of tons of sewage sludge over farms in 
the Antelope Valley, a proposal that also drew complaints from officials of 
Palmdale and Lancaster and angered local environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
"It is time the city of Los Angeles and its elected officials recognize they 
cannot use the Antelope Valley as a dumping ground for their garbage," said 
Antonovich, who represents the area. The supervisor said he would change his 
mind only if the plan were to draw "substantial community support." 
</P>
<P>
That seemed an unlikely prospect Tuesday. In response to a Times article 
disclosing the plan, Antelope Valley environmental activists also vowed to 
resist it. And city officials in Lancaster and Palmdale complained that they 
had not been told of it and doubted that it would be approved by state 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported Tuesday that the city of Los Angeles, through a private 
firm, had applied for state permission to truck up to 300 tons of sewage sludge 
a day -- more than 20% of the city's output -- to be used as fertilizer on 
3,500 acres at five farms in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The state Regional Water Quality Control Board, meeting last Thursday in Death 
Valley, had been set to approve the proposal. But a decision was delayed for 
two months after some board members complained that the sludge could 
contaminate the high desert's ground-water supply. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the federal Environmental Protection Agency and leaders of 
national environmental groups said Tuesday that government agencies across the 
country are increasingly looking to direct land application of sewage sludge as 
an option as landfill space becomes scarce. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an issue that's exploding all across the country. We're seeing hundreds 
and hundreds of these things coming out of the woodwork all over the country," 
said Douglas Rader, a senior scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund, a 
private, pro-environment group. 
</P>
<P>
Rader and EPA officials said using sludge as a fertilizer can be beneficial and 
is preferable to dumping the mud-like substance in the ocean or landfills, as 
many cities still do. But they added that the treated sewage can contaminate 
ground water and pose a health hazard if not properly regulated. 
</P>
<P>
However, some environmentalists and city officials in the Antelope Valley, the 
fastest-growing region of Los Angeles County, saw the issue in much simpler 
terms -- as yet another case of people from "down below" in Los Angeles trying 
to dump their problems somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the typical mentality about the high desert," said Lancaster Mayor 
Lynn Harrison, who said her city's government had no idea of the Los Angeles 
plan before Tuesday. She said city dwellers are "always quick to get rid of 
what they don't want up here" because they believe that "nobody lives there -- 
it doesn't matter." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure it's not going to go over very well with the community," added 
Palmdale City Administrator Bob Toone, who also said his city knew nothing of 
the proposal previously. Toone said he thought it ought to require approval by 
county planners. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Frazier, a supervising regional planner for the county, said he sees 
nothing in the proposal that would require county approval. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just horrified. We are totally against this," said Stormy Williams, a 
Rosamond resident who heads an Antelope Valley environmental group, Desert 
Citizens Against Pollution. "They are not going to get anywhere on this. 
Everyone in the valley will unite on this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles officials, who are backing the plan with a private company, Bio Gro 
Systems, insisted that the sludge program is environmentally safe and actually 
recycles what has been a waste product. The city trucks 950 tons of sludge a 
day to farms in Riverside County and Yuma, Ariz., but wants to divert about a 
third of that to the closer Antelope Valley to save money on trucking costs. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles and Bio Gro officials said they can understand the concern over the 
proposal. "Because of the public perception of sludge, we are fortunate to be 
regulated enough that we can be confident it is a good program," said Carol 
Pavon, Bio Gro's monitoring manager. 
</P>
<P>
She acknowledged that Bio Gro, although it has been pursuing the Antelope 
Valley proposal for nearly a year, until now had not discussed the plans with 
the public or city officials in Lancaster and Palmdale. But now, she said, "If 
they are interested in it, we're certainly willing to talk."

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN YSIDRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego police are investigating the slaying Monday night of an unidentified 
youth in San Ysidro. 
</P>
<P>
The body of a male Latino was found along the southern levee of a flood-control 
channel along the Tijuana River, said Bill Robinson, a spokesman for the San 
Diego Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
He said U. S. Border Patrol officers heard a gunshot about 11:15 p.m. and found 
the young man at the levee. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide division Sgt. Frank Martinez said police believe the youth was about 
15 or 16 years old. He had no identification on him. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe he is from the other side," Martinez said, adding, "We have nothing 
on him. We have nowhere to go unless somebody comes forward and identifies 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Police will take fingerprints in an attempt to identify the victim, Martinez 
said. The youth was wearing tennis shoes, blue jeans, a dark jacket and a 
light-colored shirt, he said. Deputy Coroner Jack Larkie said the boy was 
5-foot-5 and weighed 108 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said the youth was shot once in the head and was found about 150 feet 
north of the border. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said the area is the site of "almost weekly reports of assaults and 
robberies . . . committed against people who have just crossed the border 
illegally."

Operating engineers at Kelco, the nation's largest harvester of kelp, have 
ended a 10-day strike against the company. 
</P>
<P>
About 250 employees returned to their jobs Monday, one day after members of 
Local 501 of the International Union of Operating Engineers voted 
overwhelmingly to approve a new three-year contract, according to Steve 
Zapoticzny, manager of public affairs for Kelco. 
</P>
<P>
"We're obviously very happy to see them back, and things are back to normal 
now," said Zapoticzny, who declined to discuss specifics of the contract. He 
said management personnel had filled in for the striking workers and that the 
company lost no revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The operating engineers, whose wages averaged $13 an hour, were joined in the 
dispute by members of the machinists union, most of whom had honored the picket 
lines even though they had agreed earlier to a company contract offer.

THE KEY DECISION ISRAEL FACES; 
</P>
<P>
PALESTINIAN TALKS ISSUE GOES TO THE CORE OF THE PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The decision that Israel's 15-month-old coalition government couldn't bring 
itself to make may soon be made by the voters instead. 
</P>
<P>
If the Labor Party's withdrawal from the coalition brings on new national 
elections -- and the next day or so should tell if it will -- then the 
balloting is certain to be dominated by one issue: Should Israel offer to start 
political talks with Palestinians on terms that are agreeable to Labor, or on 
terms insisted upon by the Likud Party? Whatever answer the voters give will 
mark a turning point in Israel's history. 
</P>
<P>
Labor is ready, in keeping with the finely crafted plan proposed by Secretary 
of State James A. Baker III, to have an Israeli delegation meet with a 
Palestinian one in Cairo. This would be preliminary to holding elections in the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip to pick representatives who would negotiate with 
Israel about the territories' future. Labor says it accepts Baker's idea that 
one or two of the Palestinians who go to Cairo could be from among those 
deported by Israel for political activities, and one or two could claim an 
address in annexed East Jerusalem. These terms are also acceptable to Egypt, 
which everyone assumes is acting as the Palestine Liberation Organization's 
surrogate. 
</P>
<P>
But the terms are emphatically unacceptable to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's 
Likud Party. It refuses to negotiate with any Palestinians who claim 
association with East Jerusalem, and it demands an immediate end to the talks 
if it smells any hint of PLO influence in them. The Labor-Likud division is 
thus clear and seemingly unbridgeable. 
</P>
<P>
What that political division reflects as well is the far older and deeper split 
between those, like Likud, who claim all of historic Palestine as 
non-negotiably part of Israel and those, like Labor, who are pragmatically 
prepared to make territorial compromises in exchange for peace. Put on a human 
level, the ultimate question becomes whether an Israel that seeks to retain its 
liberal democratic heritage can indefinitely deny political rights to the 1.2 
million Palestinians over whom it has ruled since 1967 as a result of the war 
it did not seek. The immediate consideration is the composition of a 
Palestinian delegation in Cairo; the more fundamental one is the nature of the 
commonwealth Israelis hope to have. A decision can't be evaded much longer.

BERNSON BACKS GROUP IN PARKING DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson sided Tuesday with an Alcoholics 
Anonymous chapter in North Hollywood in its dispute with neighbors over parking 
for AA members. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson, chairman of the council's planning committee, overruled a 
lower-ranking zoning official's decision to limit to 100 the number of people 
who could attend meetings at the AA facility, known as Radford House, at 4343 
Radford Ave. 
</P>
<P>
Gail Gordon, attorney for Radford House, said the nonprofit group's North 
Hollywood chapter could not cover its expenses if meeting attendance were 
limited to 100. 
</P>
<P>
Meetings at Radford House now attract up to 200 participants. The crowds cause 
parking and noise problems for the surrounding single-family residential 
neighborhood, said Renee Gunter, leader of the homeowners group protesting the 
AA chapter's right to continue using the site. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson said he would recommend permitting up to 120 members at each AA meeting 
and up to 150 members if the group found additional off-street parking. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson also supported AA's proposal that it be permitted to hold evening 
meetings from 8 to 9:30 p.m. City zoning officials had recommended a limit of 
100 members per meeting and a curfew of 8:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
An aide to Los Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs, who represents the area, 
said Wachs favors a compromise between the homeowners and AA and is opposed to 
closing the AA meeting hall altogether, as some homeowners have urged. The 
matter next goes to the full City Council for review.

COUNCILWOMAN ANGRILY DENIES CONFLICT OF INTEREST CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Clarita City Councilwoman Jan Heidt, in an angry outburst at a council 
meeting Tuesday night, said a developer had unjustly accused her of having a 
conflict of interest that could leave her ineligible to vote on a project 
proposed by the developer. 
</P>
<P>
Heidt said she was angered by a letter to the state Fair Political Practices 
Commission by Douglas R. Ring, attorney for G.H. Palmer Associates, raising the 
issue of conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Heidt's husband, Gerald Heidt, owns property near the location of a proposed 
project by the Palmer firm at San Fernando Road and Sierra Highway. 
</P>
<P>
At a public hearing before the City Council more than a year ago, Palmer's 
attorneys had suggested Gerald Heidt's property could constitute a conflict for 
his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Heidt said she was tired of having the matter brought up again. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Ring, I am tired of being jerked around!" she said angrily. She said 
Ring's letter, mailed Tuesday, was filled with "innuendo I resent very much." 
She did not read the letter at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Carl Boyer III denounced the letter as well. "I think the letter 
alleging a conflict of interest is a filthy smoke screen," Boyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Ring, in an interview, said the letter never mentioned Heidt and sought general 
guidelines on conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
He said he only wrote the letter because of recent news accounts which 
suggested the Heidt case had never been resolved by the FPPC. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is a proposed agreement that would allow G.H. Palmer Associates to 
construct more than 2,400 condominiums in Canyon Country in exchange for $30 
million in road improvements. 
</P>
<P>
The road projects are centered in the proposed developments but would help 
traffic flow throughout Santa Clarita, city planners said. 
</P>
<P>
The council will hold a hearing to take public testimony on the issue March 27. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement would guarantee Palmer the right to build three separate projects 
-- known as Santa Catarina, Vista Terrace and Westcreek -- over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Zoning and development requirements would remain constant during the life of 
the agreement, thus freeing the developer from potential changes in city 
regulations in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, as approved March 6 by the city Planning Commission, would let 
Palmer build 1,452 condominiums in Santa Catarina, 103 condominiums in Vista 
Terrace and 903 condominiums in Westcreek. 
</P>
<P>
But Palmer officials want a fourth development, a 800-condominium project 
called The Colony, also included in the pact. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission voted to exclude The Colony, saying it had reservations 
about residential development on the 43-acre site east of the Antelope Valley 
Freeway and west of Woodfall Road.

UNIFICATION OF GERMANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Kohl: Dancing Around the Border," editorial, March 3: 
</P>
<P>
There's another way to look at it. A united Germany will soon dominate Europe. 
</P>
<P>
We should counsel Poland to negotiate with Germany and open that border so as 
to lessen its importance. 
</P>
<P>
After Poland and Germany have made peace, they can go after the Soviets to 
negotiate for the vast strip of land that is Polish that the Soviets took after 
World War II (a strip approximately 200-300 miles wide stretching from 
Lithuania to Romania. Not satisfied with helping themselves to Poland, the 
Soviets even took East Prussia after World War II). It was power politics then, 
it will be again. Surely it is better to negotiate these difficulties while the 
U.S. and Soviets have a presence there rather than later. 
</P>
<P>
The point is that power is now shifting to those who were beaten and punished. 
Before the shift is completed, it would pay to anticipate problems where 
possible. Certainly the Soviets caused these problems and should now make 
Poland whole. The West ought to be able to get Poland and Germany together. 
West Germany has already done a great deal to help Poland economically; 
political amity should be the goal so that border questions become unimportant.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 7TH LAWYER CHARGED IN INSURANCE FRAUD CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Beverly Hills lawyer was indicted Tuesday on charges he lied to a federal 
grand jury probing alleged insurance fraud by a group of Los Angeles area 
attorneys whom prosecutors have called the "Alliance." 
</P>
<P>
Barry J. Krasner, 41, was charged in San Diego with eight counts of perjury for 
testimony he gave the grand jury in December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Each count carries a penalty on conviction of up to five years imprisonment and 
a $250,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Krasner was expected to surrender Wednesday to postal agents in San Diego. His 
attorney said he would plead not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
With Krasner's indictment, seven lawyers and two others have been charged in 
the Alliance case. Seven of the nine have pleaded guilty to mail fraud, 
including Krasner's former law partner, Alan Hersh of Van Nuys, who entered his 
plea in December.

NOT A CRIME OR SOCIAL ILL, BUT A CONTROLLABLE DISEASE; 
</P>
<P>
BRITAIN STUBBORNLY FORGES ITS OWN WAY IN DEALING WITH ADDICTION, LICENSING 
DOCTORS TO PRESCRIBE 'MAINTENANCE' DOSES OF OPIATES AND AMPHETAMINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERNEST DRUCKER, Ernest Drucker is founder and executive director of the 
drug-abuse treatment program at Montefiore Medical Center and a professor of 
epidemiology and social medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in 
New York.

<TEXT>
<P>
For more than 60 years, Britain has stubbornly insisted on making up its own 
mind about the best way to deal with its drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
Drug "misuse," as the British call it, is substantial in the United Kingdom. 
With a population one-fifth the size of the United States, Britain is believed 
to have between 50,000-100,000 intravenous drug users, mostly of opiates and 
amphetamines. (In the United States, the National Institute on Drug Abuse 
estimates there are 1.2 million intravenous drug users). There has been some 
use of cocaine (as elsewhere in Europe), but it is not widespread and "crack" 
is rarely available. 
</P>
<P>
In 1926, a committee headed by Sir Humphrey Rolleston, president of the Royal 
College of Physicians, set the course for British policy: Drug addiction is a 
disease. Doctors supply addicts to "maintain" (not cure) them so that they can 
"lead fairly normal and useful lives." 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, American physicians have shunned "addiction medicine," a blend 
of psychiatry, clinical pharmacology and, since AIDS, infectious-disease 
control. The British have been practicing a version of it for decades. Because 
Britain's National Health Services, instituted soon after World War II, 
reimburses physicians who treat drug addicts, doctors are more willing to 
specialize in the field. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, addiction treatment in Great Britain has always been vaguely 
disreputable. The physician is frequently painted with the same brush as is the 
addict-patient. In part, this image is the result of a handful of doctors 
over-prescribing drugs to line their pockets in the 1960s and early 1970s. The 
abuses led to tighter regulations, special licensing for physicians treating 
addicts and the attachment of drug-dependency units to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
These changes still gave British physicians wide latitude in devising treatment 
plans to help addicts gain control over their drug habit. If these patients 
were able to hold steady jobs, have a family life and manage their drug use, 
treatment was considered successful. But treatment is still quite limited, and 
the newer multiple-drug users are more difficult to treat. This, in part, 
explains the rise in registered addicts, from 2,500 in 1970 to 15,000 in 1985. 
Yet this rate of increase was comparable to that in countries where drugs were 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Before World War I, there were drug-maintenance clinics in several U.S. cities. 
One in New York had 7,000 patients on morphine. But the Harrison Narcotics Act 
of 1914 criminalized drug addiction and forbade maintenance treatment, thereby 
driving most doctors from the field. Some American physicians tried to continue 
their work in the 1920s -- and went to prison for their efforts. That 
effectively put an end to the development of addiction treatment in the United 
States until methadone-maintenance programs emerged in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
The British experience has generated a range of programs, including methadone- 
maintenance and detoxification clinics, and drug-free therapeutic communities. 
In addition to prescribing injectable drugs, physicians are now experimenting 
with smokeable forms of cocaine and heroin to reduce needle use and the AIDS 
risk, the focus of current treatment. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the Advisory Committee on the Misuse of Drugs asserted that AIDS 
represents "a greater threat to individual and public health than drug use per 
se." Accordingly, it urged that all funding for drug-treatment programs be 
dispersed under the AIDS program of the Department of Health, the same folks 
who run the National Health Service and employ more than 90% of British 
physicians. 
</P>
<P>
Today, British doctors and all health-service agencies attempt to treat addicts 
in ways that reduce the spread of AIDS. More than 25 cities have programs for 
exchanging sterile needles. The Department of Health maintains highly visible 
public programs to educate addicts about the risk of injection and the safety 
of alternatives. I know a very proper British nurse who goes to her Liverpool 
clinic every morning to instruct addicts in safe injection practices. She shows 
them how to thoroughly clean the injection site (to prevent infections), 
provides a supply of sterile wipes and teaches methods that prevent damage to 
veins. 
</P>
<P>
All this bespeaks a fundamentally different attitude and policy toward the 
treatment of drug addiction, and despite American pressure for a tougher 
approach, British resolve is firm. The British ask that their medical 
profession play an active role in a struggle that is fought case-by-case, as is 
always true in good medicine.

<P>
THEY'RE OUT THERE CRYING FOR HELP; 
</P>
<P>
THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE STUDY SHOWS THAT TREATMENT DOES WORK. WE NEED BETTER 
TRAINING AND WIDER AVAILABILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) is chairman of the Senate 
Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How effective is drug-abuse treatment? Every program has its successes -- and 
its failures. Better training and higher standards for drug counselors are 
desperately needed. 
</P>
<P>
But the success rate of America's drug-treatment centers is impressive, even 
with all their problems. The largest and most comprehensive academic survey of 
private and public in- and outpatient centers ever done, the so-called TOPS 
study, showed that 80% of the treated addicts were still off hard drugs five 
years after completing such a program. The results, published late last year, 
also showed that the percentage of addicts holding jobs doubled and the 
percentage committing crimes dropped two-thirds. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, some addicts do relapse. And some professionals conducting treatment are 
incompetent. But these anomalies provide no grounds for limiting the 
availability of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Today, there is an acute shortage of drug-abuse facilities. Many addicts 
seeking help are told they must wait weeks, even months. There is only enough 
space to treat one-quarter of addicted pregnant women and juveniles. 
Compassion, common sense and self-interest dictates that we provide help for 
these people. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that the returns on investing in drug treatment are considerable. A 
three-month outpatient program costs taxpayers about $600 per addict. But 
during that time, we save about $1,600 in reduced welfare and Medicaid costs 
and about $1,300 in law-enforcement expenses. An addict in treatment is more 
likely to hold down a job, require less medical attention and commit fewer 
crimes. All in all, $1 invested in drug treatment pays society back $5. Few 
other social programs can match that outcome. 
</P>
<P>
But do we have a choice? Do we continue to stand by and watch a new generation 
of crack babies come into the world? Do we continue to let hard-core addicts 
run amok in the streets, robbing, mugging or worse to support their habits? 
</P>
<P>
Or perhaps we should put all addicts behind bars? Even if we believed that 
prison was preferable to treatment, the price tag for such a policy would be 
staggering. The cost of putting an addict in jail is 10 times that of placing 
him in a treatment center. A national program to provide drug treatment for 
every hard-core addict who needs help would cost us $8 billion. Building jails 
to house them would cost more than $100 billion. 
</P>
<P>
By sundown today, 56,000 hard-core addicts will have sought treatment and been 
turned away for lack of staff or space. Tonight, many of them, along with 
hundreds of thousands of other addicts, will be on the streets looking for the 
money it takes to support their habits. 
</P>
<P>
For our sake, if not for theirs, we must expand our drug treatment system -- 
now.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BERNSON ANNEXATION PROPOSAL ADVANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson's proposal to annex 13,000 acres in the 
Santa Susana Mountains was given a boost Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Without debate, the city's Planning and Land Use Management Committee voted 3 
to 0 to recommend that the full council order city officials to begin studying 
the annexation proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson, who chairs the committee, has said annexation may take two years to 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
The city should annex the area to gain control over how the Santa Susana 
Mountains are developed, Bernson contends. The area, largely undeveloped, is 
primarily held by a few large property owners. 
</P>
<P>
County sanitation officials are also looking at the area as the potential site 
for a regional landfill and have sought to buy land options in the area as a 
step toward securing a toehold.

DEAL TO SAVE LANDMARK CLINIC IN LONG BEACH FALLS THROUGH; 
</P>
<P>
ARCHITECTURE: FIGHT TO RESCUE THE BUILDING IS SEEN AS A TEST OF THE CITY'S 
PRESERVATIONIST POWERS. NOW IT APPEARS THAT THE CLINIC WILL COME DOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE FIORE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When two of its oldest and most gracious landmarks were felled by the wrecking 
ball more than a year ago, Long Beach reacted like a Gold Star mother who lost 
two sons to the war and was not about to give up another. 
</P>
<P>
But it appears that the elegant Harriman Jones Clinic, where some say half the 
people in Long Beach were born, is about to go to the graveyard. 
</P>
<P>
A deal that would have turned the 1930 building into an international school -- 
a plan preservationists had called "an answer to their prayers" -- has 
collapsed, and the clinic at Broadway and Cherry Avenue could come down as 
early as June to make way for a 49-unit condominium complex. 
</P>
<P>
The fight to save the Harriman Jones Clinic was seen by some as a test for a 
city resolved to preserve its cultural past while inviting development. The 
demise of the Italian Revival building, some say, could mean the city's tough 
new preservation tactics can do little more than forestall the inevitable: 
another pile of rubble. 
</P>
<P>
"Every building they have gone after to save is gone. They have succeeded in 
holding up the show for a year or a year and a half and that's all. . . . The 
reason is they don't want to compromise," said Don Nikols, a partner in 
Terry/Nikols Development Co., which plans to replace the clinic with 
condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
Preservationists disagree, saying the city got tough too late to save Harriman 
Jones but not the scores of other historic buildings and neighborhoods that 
have been declared cultural landmarks since February, 1989, when Ruthann Lehrer 
was appointed as the city's first historic preservation officer. 
</P>
<P>
Her position was created after the elegant Pacific Coast Club and the ornate 
Jergins Trust Building, both downtown, were leveled last year. Their sites 
remain as holes in the ground today. Lehrer's first big preservation challenge 
was the Harriman Jones Clinic, named for the man who founded the city's first 
hospital, fashioned its public health laws and designed the wood-beamed clinic 
with a burning fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
The building is in some ways as disastrous on the inside as it is beautiful on 
the outside. It is an earthquake hazard, a parking nightmare -- more than 100 
spaces short in an area where it is already tough to find a spot -- and is full 
of asbestos, developers say. 
</P>
<P>
But Lehrer managed to strike a compromise with Terry/Nikols that would have 
saved the building's Cherry Avenue facade, entryway and library at an 
additional $1-million cost to the developers. 
</P>
<P>
Some more radical preservationists were outraged still, insisting that the 
building remain intact. The battle has gone on for more than a year at a cost 
of nearly $50,000 a month in mortgage payments and upkeep to the doctors who 
own it and the developers who are in escrow to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
Then along came "the needle in the haystack" -- a Madrid-based school that 
wanted to use the building to house classes for international students, most of 
whom do not drive. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the answer to our prayers," said preservationist Rae LaForce, a leader 
in the fight to save the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
But the deal fell through this month when the cost of the property -- $3.4 
million -- and expensive renovations apparently proved too high for the school 
owners. The city's Cultural Heritage Commission has the power to block 
demolition for only six months, ending in June. It could extend the stay of 
execution for another six months if it proves that an alternative use for the 
building could be found. After that, the building comes down. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the cost of maintaining the empty clinic has run the price tag of an 
already expensive piece of property to an all-time high, and no buyer has come 
forward with a plan to save it. 
</P>
<P>
The developers said they are quickly losing the incentive to preserve even part 
of the building, when razing it would save them a million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"They think if they hold this up long enough, somebody other than the big bad 
developer will come along," Nikols said. 
</P>
<P>
It may wind up that Long Beach gambled to preserve the entire building and lost 
the chance to salvage even part of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Other developers laughed at us in the beginning when we said we would work 
with these guys," Nikols said. "They were right." 
</P>
<P>
If the city does not strike an agreement with them by June, the developers say 
they will level the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
If the city stalls the project further without finding another buyer, the 
doctors who own Harriman Jones will probably level the building, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But it isn't over yet. 
</P>
<P>
"I am beating the bushes," preservationist LaForce vowed. "My head is bloodied 
but unbowed."

DECISION SHOCKING TO SPANOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CURT HOLBREICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ORLANDO, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alex Spanos, the Chargers' owner, said he thought he had made all the key 
contacts, shook all the proper hands and had all the right answers for his 
fellow NFL owners concerning San Diego's bid to play host to the 1993 Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
He was so sure of the success of his lobbying effort that he confidently said 
on the eve of Tuesday's decision that he thought he had the votes to deliver 
the game to the city for a second time. 
</P>
<P>
But when the 28 owners' votes were counted after the first secret ballot, San 
Diego was out. Four ballots later, Phoenix had defeated Pasadena for the right 
to play host to the game, and there probably was no one more stunned and upset 
than Spanos. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just shocked, absolutely shocked," Spanos said several minutes after 
emerging from the closed-door meeting. "All I heard from the other owners was 
what a great time they had when the (1988) Super Bowl was in San Diego and how 
much they wanted to come back. No one said a bad word about San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly an hour after the vote, Spanos still was trying to figure out what had 
gone wrong. He said he entered the meeting reasonably sure he could count on a 
majority of the owners to back San Diego, and he certainly did not expect its 
bid to end on the first ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Spanos credited much of Phoenix's victory to the work of Bill Bidwill, owner of 
the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bidwills have been in this league for years," Spanos said. "They have a 
lot of friends." 
</P>
<P>
Spanos was not alone in his surprise. For the past month, San Diego and 
Pasadena officials said they considered themselves the front-runners for the 
the 1993 game, with most giving Pasadena the edge. Phoenix was said to be 
running third, even by Phoenix officials, as recently as last week. 
</P>
<P>
And when the owners' three-member Super Bowl selection committee decided 
Tuesday morning not to recommend a city (Spanos said he thought such a 
recommendation would favor Pasadena), San Diego officials said their chances 
were enhanced. 
</P>
<P>
That turn of events had Bob Payne, chairman of the San Diego Super Bowl Task 
Force, still shaking his head a half hour after the vote was announced. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still in shock," Payne said. "I guess I always saw this like a political 
campaign with two leaders butting heads, and sometimes the dark horse wins. 
That's what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Payne said the San Diego proposal was competitive, met all the league's 
requirements and was more generous than the bid that won the city the 1988 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't stub our toe," Payne said. "We had a strong bid." 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix also offered a tempting financial package that included extra 
sweeteners such as free hotel rooms for NFL meetings scheduled there in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody always realized that Phoenix had a lot of attractive 
characteristics," Payne said. "Their only negative was that they were the new 
kid on the block and that might not work in their favor." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, just the opposite happened. Since Bidwill moved his team from St. 
Louis before the start of the 1988 season, he has faced a fan backlash and 
public criticism over what were the league's highest average ticket prices. 
</P>
<P>
The chance to bring Phoenix its first Super Bowl was viewed as a boost to the 
NFL's newest city and to Bidwill personally. 
</P>
<P>
"We had heard a long time ago that if Bidwill ever said, 'Hey, guys, I need 
help,' then he would get it," Payne said. "That's what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Payne said San Diego officials already have decided that they will seek the 
next available Super Bowl in 1995. The 1994 field already has been narrowed to 
Atlanta, Miami, New Orleans and Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Steeg, NFL director of special events, said no decision on the bidding 
process for the 1995 game is expected until later this year at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
"My guess is the '95 game will be between Los Angeles and San Diego," Payne 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike San Diego, Pasadena might be discouraged from mounting another bid 
soon because of what an official said was a "political" outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"It upsets us that this was not a business decision," said David Simon, 
president of the Los Angeles Sports Council. "We would have to think seriously 
before bidding again."

SOCKERS SHOW SIGNS OF LIFE IN 9-3 VICTORY 
</P>

<P>
Maybe the management of the Sockers should consider making trades more 
frequently. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago, the Sockers shipped temperamental forward Zoran Karic off to chilly 
Cleveland in exchange for Paul Wright, a speedy 20-year-old forward who slipped 
through the Sockers' fingers during last summer's free agent draft. The 
question begging an answer was whether it was worth swapping a guy who led the 
team in scoring during the regular season last year for a second-year player 
who played infrequently as a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night before a San Diego Sports Arena crowd of just 5,538 -- the fewest 
at home since 5,525 watched a game with Dallas on Feb. 3, 1987 -- the Sockers 
defeated the St. Louis Storm, 9-3. 
</P>
<P>
Draw your own conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
One game is only a small indicator that this was a smart trade. But, if nothing 
else, it was proof that there is life left in a team that seemed ready for the 
Major Indoor Soccer League obituary page less than three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that the Storm (19-21) had defeated the Sockers (17-21) in four of 
six meetings before Tuesday night. Also keep in mind that we're talking about a 
Socker team that had previously won by more than four goals only once this 
season, and only once had scored nine goals. 
</P>
<P>
So there were a lot of happy Socker faces by the time rookie forward Rod Castro 
scored 58 seconds into the fourth quarter to give the Sockers the final goal of 
their offensive party. They were talking with renewed zest in the locker room 
minutes after the final ball was played. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got the team that should be playing right now," defender George 
Fernandez said. "Everybody feels good about themselves." 
</P>
<P>
The coach feels good, too. 
</P>
<P>
"That should make a few people sit up and take notice around the league," Coach 
Ron Newman said. "It was great. There was no slackness tonight." 
</P>
<P>
How did the Sockers pile up so many goals? Let us count the ways. 
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Waad Hirmez started things in the first quarter, followed by 
midfielder Branko Segota and forward Jim Gabarra. The first quarter ended with 
the Sockers ahead, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
Second quarter. Gabarra scores again, his seventh of the season. Midfielder 
Thompson Usiyan scores for St. Louis to make it 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Third quarter. Hirmez starts things off again with a goal off a restart kick 
from Wright. Segota scores the next two goals for a hat trick and a 7-1 Socker 
lead. Segota now has 700 points in his MISL career. 
</P>
<P>
"I was due," Segota said. "I've been hitting the post and crossbar all year. 
I've also had minor injuries that have slowed me down a little. I feel good 
now. I had 10 days off to take care of the knicks and knacks." 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes after Segota polished off his hat trick, Gabarra made it 8-1 a to 
pick up one of his own, the second of his MISL career. Then, after Castro 
scored, St. Louis got late goals from midfielders Daryl Doran and Claudio De 
Oliveira. 
</P>
<P>
Though he only collected one assist, Wright's presence was felt. The Sockers 
suddenly have quick, fresh feet at the midfield position, which allows Segota 
to play forward and take his hacks at the goal. From now on, opponents of the 
Sockers will keep a nervous eye on Wright as they double-team Segota. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they have to worry about his speed," Segota said. "By playing up 
front, I'm more effective. When you go back and forth and then you still have 
to battle the double-coverage, it's tough." 
</P>
<P>
Socker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Despite a season filled with ups and downs, the Sockers are still talking with 
the confidence of champions. Asked about the playoffs, defender Kevin Crow 
said, "I don't see anybody that's going to beat us in a series. A lot of guys 
on our team, right, wrong or indifferent, are in the habit of looking at their 
calendar on October 1st and saying 'Man, the season goes all the way to April.' 
It's hard for some of our guys to play at a high level the whole season. But 
they can suck it up for short periods of time, and that's what happens in the 
playoffs." Midfielder Brian Quinn missed his fifth consecutive game with 
tendinitis of the groin, which he said will probably keep him out of weekend 
games with Kansas City and Baltimore. Also not in uniform Tuesday was veteran 
forward Steve Zungul and forward Damir Haramina, out with strained a 
quadriceps.

CAMARILLO PUTS ASIDE ADVERSITY IN 6-4 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Camarillo High's baseball team eased the pain of an apparent forfeit in the 
title game of the Westside tournament's Blue Division with a 6-4 win over 
Ventura on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Scorpions violated a new rule that limits a pitcher to 30 outs from Monday 
through Saturday. Eric Raba pitched 14 innings, or 42 outs, in complete-game 
tournament wins over Notre Dame on Tuesday and Chatsworth on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
According to state rules, violation of the rule results in a forfeit. But 
Southern Section officials Tuesday delayed announcement of the forfeit, pending 
an appeal. Camarillo Coach Jack Willard admitted Monday that he overlooked the 
rule and said the Scorpions will not appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Against Ventura, Leonard Lopez, Corey Tucker and Matt Tackett each had two hits 
for Camarillo (6-0). 
</P>
<P>
In other baseball games: 
</P>

Gabe Villasenor hit solo home runs for Alemany (3-3). 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy 10, Granada Hills 8 -- Palmer Drain's bases-loaded triple tied the 
score, 8-8, in the sixth inning and Ben Guzman singled home Drain for the 
winning run in a North Valley League game at Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Drain had two hits, scored two runs and had three runs batted in to lead 
Kennedy (6-1, 2-0). Robert Fowble hit two doubles for Granada Hills (1-5, 0-2). 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando 15, Cleveland 2 -- Canto Franco struck out five and gave up two 
hits for San Fernando (4-1-1, 1-1) in a North Valley League game at San 
Fernando. John Najar hit a two-run homer in the first. 
</P>
<P>
Taft 4, Canoga Park 3 -- Michael Krasner's two-run double in the sixth inning 
gave host Taft the West Valley League win. 
</P>
<P>
Poly 8, North Hollywood 2 -- Wil Molina and Jonathan Campbell were both two for 
three to lead host Poly (4-2, 2-0) to an East Valley League victory.

POWAY WINS; OG PITCHER SETS NO-HIT RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN GEIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was the bottom of the first -- which in itself was a bit twisted, 
considering the visiting team was batting -- and Chula Vista Coach Dick Barcus 
was yelling at his hitters not to swing at Poway pitcher Danny Miller's 
breaking pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the only pitch he's going to get us out with. He's not going to get us 
out with the fastball, so wait for it," Barcus barked. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps his players didn't listen. Because six innings later, Miller had struck 
out 11 Spartans, four with that breaking pitch, a split-finger "fastball." He 
had allowed only two hits. And Poway went on to win, 8-0, in a Hilltop-Moose 
tournament game at Poway. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just trying to get to me," said Miller (1-0). "I tried not to listen to 
what he was saying." 
</P>
<P>
Barcus seemingly wasn't offering the best advice, anyway. Guess that's why they 
call it chatter. Miller was as impressive with his fastball as he was with his 
split-finger pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to think my fastball is my authority pitch," Miller said. "But I like 
to throw off-speed stuff to keep them off balance." 
</P>
<P>
Miller has now struck out 19 batters in 14 innings and has allowed only five 
hits and one run. 
</P>
<P>
As far as offense goes, Poway (3-0-1) scored two in the first, both on 
ground-ball outs, and did not get to Chula Vista starter Jason Cross again 
until the sixth when they pushed across two more runs thanks to a two-run 
single from Rob Plarski. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans scored four more times in the seventh on just two hits as pitchers 
Chris Montelongo and Art Castro combined to walk four batters and hit another. 
</P>
<P>
As to why the visiting Spartans were batting second: The game was originally 
scheduled for Chula Vista, but renovation work on the field there caused the 
switch to Poway. JOHN GEIS

<P>
Murray, who headed the division for a year, will become a senior project 
manager at Morse, Richard, Weisenmiller &amp; Associates, an energy consulting 
firm in Oakland. She made the move, the commission said, to be able to work

* Saudi Largess: King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, who contributed $1 million to Nancy 
Reagan's war on drugs, also donated $1 million to Barbara Bush's campaign 
against illiteracy, financial records show. Fahd made his gift to the Barbara 
Bush Foundation for Family Literacy Sept. 29, 1989, Saudi officials in 
Washington acknowledged Monday. 
</P>
<P>
About the same time earlier this month that Fahd was helping fund Nancy 
Reagan's anti-drug campaign, he was secretly providing $2 million a month to 
help fund the Nicaraguan Contras at the request of President Ronald Reagan. 
Barbara Bush's press office declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
* Book Awards: Five writers have been nominated in Washington for the 
PEN-Faulkner Award for the best fiction of 1989. They are novelists Russell 
Banks ("Affliction"), E.L. Doctorow ("Billy Bathgate"), Molly Gloss ("The 
Jump-Off Creek"), Lynne Sharon Schwartz ("Leaving Brooklyn") and short story 
writer Josephine Jacobsen ("On the Island"). The winner will be announced in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
* Common Ground: Miss America Debbye Turner, 24, met with a group of troubled 
girls and discovered that "our dreams and expectations are not all that 
different." Turner talked Sunday with seven girls ages 14 to 18 at a community 
center in Egg Harbor City, N.J. Turner said each girl agreed to write to the 
others so they could chart each other's progress. 
</P>
<P>
* Same Song: Social activism in the '90s still centers around human rights, 
says folk singer and longtime activist Mary Travers, one-third of the folk trio 
Peter, Paul and Mary. "The issues today are a question of ecology, education 
and a new virulent racism," she said in Nashville Sunday. People are not as 
giving as 30 years ago, Travers said. "In the 1960s, the economic 
infrastructure was healthy and people could afford to be generous."

JACK SMITH: NO T-BIRD WAS THIS . . . BUT THE MODEL WAS SPECIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Men of my age can be divided into two kinds -- those who owned a Model T Ford 
and those who were denied that challenging experience. 
</P>
<P>
A man never forgets his first Model T. It was a car that brought out the best 
in men, or boys, compelling them to learn its idiosyncratic mechanics and 
drawing them forth into heroic adventures of the road. 
</P>
<P>
I had a 1922 Model T coupe. But I bought it in 1935. So it was 13 years old 
when I drove it off a used-car lot on South Figueroa, for $22. Like most Model 
Ts, it was black. It was high off the ground, and shaped something like an 
18th-Century sedan chair. 
</P>
<P>
I was at that time a reporter for the March Field Courier, a newspaper that 
served all 36 Southern California camps of the Civilian Conservation Corps, and 
I drove that car all over our southern mountain ranges, going from camp to camp 
for news. I had the paper's logo pasted on the windshield. I was a dashing 
fellow in my press car. 
</P>
<P>
It is hard to restrain a Model T owner from telling some story of exhilarating 
hardship on the road, some foolhardy excursion undertaken in the most 
inauspicious circumstances. And the car itself is always the hero. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Taylor of Tustin recalls a trip he and his brother Ray made through the 
desert to Phoenix in their hopped-up 1918 Model T back in 1927. Among numerous 
other improvements they had installed a new carburetor, an extra gas tank and a 
Claxon horn. 
</P>
<P>
They packed the car with food, water, oil, tire patches, inner tubes, a tire 
casing, a pump and other tools, and pooled their life savings -- $26. They set 
out at 4:30 a.m., taking Western Avenue to the Coast Highway and heading south 
for Tijuana. (They wanted to say they had been in Mexico.) 
</P>
<P>
They drove on to Calexico and then headed through the desert toward Yuma. Those 
who did not live in that era must realize that the roads in the Southwest were 
primitive, gas stations were a day apart, and one might travel for hours 
without meeting a car coming in the other direction. 
</P>
<P>
They camped that night in Yuma. Next morning they learned that the only road to 
Phoenix began with the notorious Plank Road, a road made of railroad ties 
chained together and stretched over the sand dunes for miles. Every mile or so 
a widened section allowed cars to pull out or pass. They met only one car: a 
party from Philadelphia who were too inept to back up to a pull-out place. The 
boys did it for them. 
</P>
<P>
When the Plank Road over the sand dunes ended, they camped out a night, then 
followed a narrow, lonely desert road into Painted Rocks, Gila Bend and finally 
Phoenix. They camped out of town in a grove of trees by a cool, clear stream, 
then set out the next morning for home through Wickenburg, Aguila, Wenden, 
Salome and Quartzsite, where they had a harrowing near-tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
A fallen wooden arrow sign said MINE. They followed the rutted road about a 
mile and came to an old mining shack beside a pit about seven feet across. They 
couldn't see the bottom. An old wooden ladder hung down into the pit. Bob 
decided to see where it led. He climbed down about 15 rungs, brushing off 
spider webs; then a rung broke under his feet. He hung by his hands, bicycling 
helplessly in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
"I began to gasp for breath and was so frightened that I could hardly be heard. 
Ray was up above yelling down. 'Can't you hear me? Are you OK?' I was now in a 
state of semi-shock. And then I heard Ray say, 'I'll get the sash cord and tie 
it to the axle and drop it down to you!' 
</P>
<P>
"What seemed like hours later Ray dropped down the sash cord. I tied it to my 
waist with some difficulty, and between Ray, the car and me, I was able to 
climb back, up and out." 
</P>
<P>
I contemplated an even more perilous trip. I was going to drive my Model T down 
the Baja peninsula, all the way to La Paz. There was no road at all. 
Fortunately, the car died on the way to San Bernardino and I sold it for $4.

SCREEN STYLE: RUSSIAN DRESSING

THE MOVIE: "The Hunt for Red October" 
</P>
<P>
THE SET-UP: Tom Clancy's pre-Gorbachev thriller about a defecting Soviet 
submarine captain, Marko Ramius (Sean Connery) and the American voice of reason 
CIA analyst Jack Ryan (Alec Baldwin), is the basis of the movie. But this is no 
update on "The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming." No comrades, the 
submarine carrying the pensive, brilliant Capt. Ramius is a top-of-the-line 
typhoon-class sub able to travel without a telltale sonar echo. Which comes in 
real handy when avoiding those speed traps near Thor's Twins off the coast of 
Iceland. Needless to say, this ship (the Red October of the movie's title) 
becomes the hottest, most sought-after vehicle in the Greater North Atlantic. 
Sorta like an ocean-going Miata. 
</P>
<P>
THE LOOK: Uniformly speaking, it's the basic, monochromatic, no-nonsense look 
from the American military Establishment: khaki shirts and slacks above the 
waterline, and in the belly of the American sub in hot pursuit, it's a little 
more Navy: navy blues, denim shirts and even a little J. Crew, with white 
turtlenecks under the officers' jackets. We've seen it all a thousand times. 
But those Soviets: ahh, a little more romance, a little more stylish flair. 
Connery looks like Russia's last czar with his l-o-o-n-g buzz cut, 
distinguished beard, and severe, cobalt blue tunic jacket with a stand-up 
collar. His officers are dressed similarly, their chests aglow with combat 
ribbons and medals and the shine of brass buttons. The lesser seamen wear navy 
blue and stripes. Co-star Baldwin tries for a typical bureaucratic, rumpled 
look: slacks, white shirts, and at one point, a purloined Navy officer's dress 
uniform. Russians win the style war, hands down. 
</P>
<P>
THE LABELS: For the U.S. Navy, especially the khaki, the source was Army-Navy 
surplus. The rest of the uniforms (500 of them) were handmade by costumers 
under the film's wardrobe supervisor, Jim Tyson. The Russian uniforms were 
based on what Tyson could find among collectors who had Russian paraphernalia. 
"We Hollywooded it up some. It's not that the Russian uniforms are incorrect, 
it's just something they'd be more likely to wear in an office or for dress. 
What they really wear on submarines is blue fatigue jumpers. More like a 
janitorial jumper than anything." The most difficult thing to get was the 
Russian insignia and braids for the uniforms. "Believe it or not," Tyson said, 
"the Mainland Chinese make the insignia for the real Russian Army. However, 
Chinese New Year occurred right before we had to start shooting, and they 
celebrate for weeks! We got the stuff literally the day before we began!" SUE

DR. NEIL SOLOMON: MILK ALLERGIES

Question: When I try to drink milk by itself, I usually have a reaction to it. 
</P>
<P>
I think I may be allergic to it. But when I have milk with chocolate syrup, it 
doesn't seem to bother me. Can chocolate keep someone from being allergic to 
milk? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: People who are lactose-intolerant may experience gas and bloating when 
they try to drink milk. As I've explained previously, these people lack a 
sufficient amount of the intestinal enzyme lactase, which digests lactose. 
Lactose, in turn, is the sugar found in milk. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators have reported that when chocolate flavoring is added to milk, the 
symptoms of gas and bloating are not as prominent. Exactly why this occurs is 
not known.

GILBERT &amp; SULLIVAN COMPANY DECIDES IT WILL BRANCH OUT

<TEXT>
<P>
When the San Diego Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Company ends its 11th season with 
"The Gondoliers," March 30 through April 8 at the Casa Del Prado Theatre in 
Balboa Park, it will also be doffing its name and ending an era. 
</P>
<P>
The company will be reborn as the San Diego Comic Opera Company. 
</P>
<P>
And just what's in that name? Plenty. 
</P>
<P>
Leon Natker, chosen as the company's artistic director last year, said the new 
name will reflect a new repertoire for the organization. The company will 
branch out with a variety of old and new musical theater and small opera 
offerings in its three- to four-play seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The first show of the 1990-1991 season will be "The Beggar's Opera" by John 
Gay, opening Sept. 14 at the Casa Del Prado. The other shows, with specific 
dates to be announced, will be a concert celebrating the 75th anniversary of 
Balboa Park with music of 1915, including selections from John Philip Sousa, 
George M. Cohan and Gilbert and Sullivan in October; "Rose Marie," composed by 
Rudolf Friml with book and lyrics by Otto Harbach and Oscar Hammerstein II, in 
March or April, and "H.M.S. Pinafore," by Gilbert and Sullivan, in June. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for changing the focus of the organization is that the 
restrictions of a limited repertoire are catching up with the company. 
</P>
<P>
"How long can you support a theater that keeps recycling a dozen pieces?" 
Natker asked. "After we ran through the entire G&amp;S repertoire in the first 
five years, subscriptions took a dramatic 40% dive. We've never really built 
back. When Holly (Hollace Koman, founder and first artistic director of the 
company) started, she had wonderful casts. That changed when she could no 
longer afford to pay her artists as much and they were tired of doing the same 
thing over and over again." 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Comic Opera Company will still produce at least one Gilbert and 
Sullivan operetta a year, Natker promised. But don't be surprised if even that 
opera is not what it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
"The Gondoliers," directed by Natker, will be set in modern Venice. Natker's 
aim is to play up the political satire in Gilbert's tirade about the extremists 
of democracy fighting the extremists of monarchy, without a single sensible 
voice among them. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're trying to do is find parallels in our own era," Natker said. "The 
political points are salient. It's all about little islands like Grenada and 
the Falklands, about dictatorships and colonialism. I want people to go away 
from this not only being entertained, but thinking about something as well. 
That was Gilbert's objective." 
</P>
<P>
Also among Natker's objectives is to offer surprise where the San Diego Gilbert 
&amp; Sullivan Company once promised predictability. 
</P>
<P>
By presenting rarely seen, small-scale productions of works by Offenbach, early 
Jerome Kern and Cohan, as well as small chamber musicals and small commissioned 
pieces, Natker hopes to attract the growing San Diego audiences that have come 
to expect new and experimental works from leading local theaters, especially in 
the past six or seven years. 
</P>
<P>
The theater has a balanced budget now, after battling a deficit for the past 
four to five years, Natker said. But that can change quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to compete with all these theaters," Natker said. "I have to say, 'Come 
spend your theater dollars with me and not with them.' I've got to offer a new 
audience something new to see. I know I've already offended some of the people 
on the church-singing circuit who have nice voices but are not actors. But if 
we don't change, we're going away. We're in a make-or-break situation. Either 
the company goes into the 1990s or it closes its doors."

TAKING THE SHIRTS OFF STARS' BACKS FOR CHARITY

If you want to get something on your chest, here's your chance. The fourth 
annual Celebri-T-Shirt Auction will be May 4 at the Kona Kai Club on Shelter 
Island. Once again, more than 250 T-shirts autographed by celebrities, most of 
them pop stars, will be auctioned off to raise money for the Storefront, San 
Diego County's only emergency shelter for homeless youth. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the first auction, in May, 1987, were used to finance the 
February, 1988, reopening of the Storefront. The downtown shelter -- jointly 
operated by San Diego Youth and Community Services, Catholic Community 
Services, and METRO, the social-service agency of the United Methodist churches 
-- originally opened in October, 1985, but was forced to shut nine months later 
due to a lack of funds. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's auction boosted the Storefront's coffers by nearly $50,000. The 
five priciest shirts, and their winning bids, were those signed by the late Roy 
Orbison ($1,275), Jimmy Buffett ($725), the Beach Boys ($650), the Grateful 
Dead ($625), and Hollywood Rat Packers Sammy Davis Jr., Dean Martin, and Frank 
Sinatra ($600). 
</P>
<P>
At this year's affair, Storefront volunteers will put more shirts signed by 
Orbison (two), Buffett (two), and the Beach Boys (one) on the auction block. 
Other pop stars whose autographed T-shirts will be up for bid range from Chet 
Atkins to Ozzy Osbourne, from the Fabulous Thunderbirds to the Fine Young 
Cannibals, from the New Bohemians to New Order. 
</P>
<P>
"Typically, we go through the business managers of the pop stars," said event 
coordinator Cynthia L. Perry. "We write them, explain what the cause is, and 
just make the request. For the most part, we do OK; we have stuff coming in all 
the time." 
</P>
<P>
Also scheduled to be auctioned off is an assortment of rock 'n' roll 
memorabilia, including autographed photos of De La Soul, Debbie Gibson, Billy 
Joel, Elton John and George Michael; a soccer ball signed by Rod Stewart; an 
autographed Doobie Brothers concert program, and a pair of drum sticks and drum 
gloves used by Motley Crue's Tommy Lee. 
</P>
<P>
"I just called Madonna to see what she'd be giving us, and we're hoping for a 
bustier, fancy bra, something slinky," said Storefront volunteer Salli Stiner, 
who's in charge of acquisitions. "And we're 90% certain we'll have a Fender 
guitar autographed by Eric Clapton. 
</P>
<P>
"I also just got off the phone with Bob Dylan's people. I was initially 
thinking of getting this book that contains all his artwork, poetry and songs, 
and having him sign that, but then his press people said, 'Why don't we just 
let Bob pick out something he thinks will be wonderful?' 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of exciting -- I'm just sitting here waiting, wondering what it's 
going to be." An auction preview party will be May 1 at Tom Fat's Tropical Cafe 
in Middletown. 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: January and February were busy months for Hit Single Recording 
Services, the local studio in the basement of the Marketplace at the Grove 
shopping center in East San Diego. Polydor Records recording artist Mildred 
Douglas from Holland stopped in to cut basic tracks for her next solo album. 
Guest session-men included singer Greg Walker and drummer Walfredo Reyes of 
Santana and ex-Weather Report bassist Alphonso Johnson. Then came Country Dick 
Montana of the Beat Farmers, overseeing post-production of an upcoming live 
album by the Pleasure Barons, a touring revue he fronted last year with 
ex-Blasters guitarist Dave Alvin and fellow San Diegan Mojo Nixon. In the 
meantime, local bands the Harpoons, the Tell-Tale Hearts, Healing Arts, and the 
Holy Love Snakes dropped by to record demonstration tapes. . . .

Alligator Records, a tiny independent blues label from Chicago, has just 
released the third album by San Diego roots-rockers the Paladins. Saturday 
night, the trio is throwing a record-release party at San Diego State 
University's Backdoor. They'll be performing live versions of most of the 12 
songs on "Let's Buzz," an invigorating blend of rockabilly, blues, 
rhythm-and-blues and country. The album was recorded in Los Angeles, at the 
private recording studio of 1970s soulster Leon Haywood, who topped the charts 
in 1975 with "I Want'a Do Something Freaky to You." Haywood plays keyboards on 
the album; other guest stars are legendary New Orleans saxophonist Lee Allen, 
currently with the Blasters, and Los Lobos saxist Steve Berlin. Berlin 
co-produced "Let's Buzz" with Mark Linnett. . . .

McCartney's Causes: Former Beatle Paul McCartney has donated $250,000 to fight 
cancer and help preserve the Earth's resources. 
</P>
<P>
Half of the funds will go to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New 
York and the other half to the Japanese chapter of the environmental group 
Friends of the Earth, a McCartney publicist said Tuesday. "I . . . have hope 
that one day science and medicine will find a way to beat cancer forever," 
McCartney said in a statement. McCartney, 47, has been using his world concert 
tour as a platform to promote the activities of Friends of the Earth. SHAUNA

'AKIRA': HIGH-TECH HOKUM FROM JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Akira" (at the Westside Pavilion), a Japanese animated feature based on 
Katsuhiro Otomo's popular comic books about a teen-age motorcycle gang, is a 
compendium of the worst cliches of Japanese animation -- two hours of chases, 
laser attacks, machine-gun battles, spilled stage blood, computer-animated 
backgrounds and hokey dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
Buried in the morass is a story of sorts, but anyone who isn't well-grounded in 
the Akira comics, which are set in post-apocalypse Tokyo, circa AD 2030, will 
be hopelessly lost by the end of the first half-hour. 
</P>
<P>
Otomo, who wrote and directed the movie, has told interviewers that he set out 
to "make a film that would be a jumble of images, instead of just showing the 
highlights of each scene," and on that score, he succeeded. "Akira" is a jumble 
of high-tech visuals that will appeal only to hard-core Japanese animation 
fans. Viewers in search of a coherent narrative or polished animation should 
look elsewhere. CHARLES SOLOMON

PIANIST ROMERO SOARS AS STAR OF CHAMBER ORCHESTRA PROGRAM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Seldom absent from the local scene for more than a few months, pianist Gustavo 
Romero returned triumphantly Monday night to Sherwood Auditorium as soloist 
with the San Diego Chamber Orchestra. The ever-smiling Romero, winner of last 
year's Clara Haskil piano competition, subdued the mighty challenges of 
Saint-Saens' Second Piano Concerto with confidence and technique to spare. 
</P>
<P>
From his bold, fluid opening solo, he demonstrated the enviable ease with which 
he shifted from brilliant, explosive attacks to elegant sighs, without batting 
an eyelash. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old pianist took in stride the sophisticated antics in the Allegro 
scherzando, cleanly delineating the rippling phrases of Saint-Saens' 
tongue-in-chic. Like Romero's Mozart playing, which to date has been his 
calling card, his performance of this large-scale concerto bristled with 
urgency and a keen sense of drama surging beneath the shimmering surface. 
</P>
<P>
Music director Donald Barra and his orchestra played in Romero's shadow and at 
one grand climax were actually drowned out by a fury of crashing octaves from 
the Steinway. 
</P>
<P>
Barra cannily placed the Saint-Saens Concerto at the end of the concert, since 
his Sherwood Auditorium audiences are notorious for decamping at intermission 
once the guest artist has dispensed with the obligatory solo vehicle. Although 
this meant the sold-out house had to remain for the full program, the wait for 
Romero was relatively painless and -- at least in the case of the orchestra's 
stylish, alert reading of Beethoven's First Symphony -- rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
For this program, Barra had all the wind players in place and added some extra 
strings for good measure. In the Beethoven, this made the orchestra's balance 
close to ideal, and, under Barra's sympathetic direction, the First Symphony 
sparkled with a jaunty, optimistic bounce. It was one of the chamber 
orchestra's most cohesive, convincing performances this season. 
</P>
<P>
The program-opening Mozart Overture from "The Abduction from the Seraglio" was 
peppy but significantly less polished, and Darius Milhaud's urbane, Brazilian 
picture post card, "Le Boeuf sur le Toit," lacked its wonted joyous 
spontaneity. Barra drove it relentlessly and without humor, allowing the 
orchestra's fortes to bray uncomfortably in the modest 500-seat hall. Principal 
trumpet John Wilds relished his carnival-like solos and executed them with 
stentorian authority.

TALES OF HOLLYWOOD TOLD WELL IN 'ALEPH 4' AT SAXON-LEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While watching "Aleph 4," the latest in Pipeline's series of grouped (usually 
four) performance pieces at Saxon-Lee Gallery, it's funny to think of how 
Hollywood is governed more than ever by the ethic of the high concept -- 
meaning low movies. That is because this particular "Aleph" has a concept of 
its own: Hollywood, and what it does to people. 
</P>
<P>
One of the pieces, to be sure, doesn't follow the concept. Kedric Robin Wolfe's 
"Snooksie," a quaint personal memoir about a favorite dog who stole dinner 
goodies and yapped at passing cars, is also the slightest thing Wolfe, with 
director Scott Kelman, has ever done and somewhat out of place here. 
</P>
<P>
The other three, connected by Linda Hammett's sneaky and surprising dance 
interludes, aren't slight at all. 
</P>
<P>
Every person who has ever slaved in the Industry, gophering today to be the 
Spielberg of tomorrow, should see the opener, Michael Schlitt's "Drive He 
Said." Schlitt sits on a stool most of the time, recalling life as a menial 
assistant for Joe, a heavyweight commercial director/producer. Schlitt's ironic 
adventure to the heart of Joe, told with charming immediacy under Dean 
Robinson's direction, is oddly breezy for a tale about desperate survival. 
</P>
<P>
This makes an interesting lead-in to Maud Winchester's "Psycho Babble in 
Babylon," also directed by Robinson. Winchester's actress, unlike Schlitt's 
gopher, actually hits the jackpot -- so much so that she uses her percentage of 
the grosses to fund pet causes and then to buy a town. In fact, Winchester's 
script, which treads along the edge of cliche without ever falling in, suggests 
that making movies isn't what it's about at all. It's about creative 
investments, the more self-aggrandizing the better. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood swallows everyone alive in the end, though, and chomps down 
especially hard on any unsuspecting artist who wanders in. Enter "Bert Sees the 
Light," writer-director R. A. White's ingenious comic history of Bertolt 
Brecht's escape from Hitler to movieland. 
</P>
<P>
White takes several risks here, and they all work superbly. First, he doesn't 
adopt a Brechtian style for actors Jack Black, Michael Rivkin and Molly Bryant 
to follow, but goes for a hyperactive pace that is half Mack Sennett, half 
Billy Wilder. Then, he doesn't accord Brecht much reverence, but rather sees 
him as a somewhat stumbling survivor. And he has both Black and Rivkin play 
Brecht, alternating at lightning speed as Bryant's hilarious ditzy character 
introduces the next scene. 
</P>
<P>
Brecht is reduced to third-degree conversations with dumb producers and 
drawling U.S. senators, and reduced even further by the one law that applies to 
everyone in Hollywood: Deliver the Goods. White and company do, with a swift 
kick in the pants. 
</P>

 At 7525 Beverly Blvd., on Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m., through March 31.

NIGHTMARE AHEAD;

COAST HIGHWAY IS PUSHED TO LIMIT IN L.A. COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD B. TAYLOR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pacific Coast Highway wends its way along the California shoreline for nearly a 
thousand scenic miles, offering motorists a leisurely, often spectacular drive. 
Then the highway crosses into Los Angeles County and the character of the route 
changes radically. 
</P>
<P>
From the Ventura County line to Santa Monica, California 1 becomes a congested 
and dangerous stretch of road, its critics say. 
</P>
<P>
Along this 28-mile stretch known as PCH, the highway snakes by Point Dume and 
Malibu Point, through urban areas with expensive homes and high-use beaches. 
</P>
<P>
During rush hour, traffic often slows to a crawl and gridlock is only a stalled 
car, a fender-bender or a mudslide away. 
</P>
<P>
Almost everyone ignores the 40 m.p.h. posted speed, police say. Cars zip along 
at 55 or faster on the undivided highway. And the number of crashes along most 
of PCH has climbed steadily, with a 15% increase over the last four years 
alone, reports show. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a nightmare," said Dave Roper, a California Department of Transportation 
official who oversees highway operations in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The highway now carries as many as 75,000 cars a day, nearly double the peak 
flows of the 1970s, reports show. 
</P>
<P>
Congestion is heavy, but Roper said there is no room to build more lanes. 
</P>
<P>
"Essentially the highway is in the worst possible location," he said. "On the 
one side is the beach, on the other a bluff of unstable land. . . . So all we 
can do is try to squeeze more (space) out of the existing right of way." 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the area blame the state for not solving the congestion problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Caltrans talks a lot, but nothing is being done," said Malibu Chamber of 
Commerce spokesman Richard Idler. "We've got a major commute problem in the 
mornings. There are bottlenecks all along the highway from Big Rock to Topanga 
Canyon . . . and that's complicated by the Z traffic." 
</P>
<P>
"Z traffic" refers to San Fernando Valley commuters who drive a zigzag course 
from the Ventura Freeway over the mountains to PCH as a way to reach the Santa 
Monica Freeway heading downtown. This, the Z drivers say, avoids the congested 
Ventura Freeway. But coastal residents complain that Z drivers clog the canyon 
roads and PCH, causing 10-minute delays at some signal lights. 
</P>
<P>
As congestion has increased, so has the number of accidents. Last year there 
were 762 accidents on the 26 miles of PCH patrolled by the California Highway 
Patrol, a 15% increase since 1985, according to CHP spokeswoman Donna Urquidi. 
During the same period, 11 people were killed in accidents, down from 13 in 
1985, she said. 
</P>
<P>
During rush hour, most accidents are fender-benders. But at other times, speed, 
unsafe U-turns and motorists driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol 
have contributed to head-on wrecks over the years, police say. 
</P>
<P>
Most notorious is the two-mile stretch in the city of Santa Monica, where the 
Santa Monica Freeway feeds into the McClure Tunnel. Motorists traveling at 
freeway speeds flash through the tunnel and head north on PCH, then suddenly 
are confronted by the beach, the blue Pacific and six congested lanes of 
undivided traffic. 
</P>
<P>
High bluffs are on the right; the beach, parking lots and expensive houses are 
on the left. For nearly two miles there are no cross streets, no place to turn 
around. And "No U-Turn" signs are everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Tourists bound for the Santa Monica Pier often find themselves heading the 
wrong way up the coast. Confused, they slow or pull into the double 
yellow-striped median lane, trying to turn back. Other drivers zoom around the 
slow-moving vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The speed limit is no longer strictly enforced, police said. "We've been told 
not to enforce the (40 m.p.h.) speed limit," said Santa Monica Police Capt. 
Bill King. 
</P>
<P>
The courts throw many tickets out because the posted speeds are not realistic 
and virtually everyone is speeding, King said. 
</P>
<P>
For years the accident rate had been rising along this two-mile stretch. By 
1987, Santa Monica police were reporting roughly 100 accidents and three 
fatalities a year on PCH, double the 1983 accident rate. Then the statistics 
dropped last year to 58 wrecks and two fatalities within the city's 
jurisdiction on PCH. King credited a crackdown on drunk drivers with helping to 
reduce the number of accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Although the annual number of accidents along the rest of PCH is rising, 
Caltrans engineers contend the rate of accidents per million miles driven is 
lower than average when compared to similar roads. 
</P>
<P>
State crews have been trying for years to make traffic along PCH safer and 
smoother. 
</P>
<P>
They made one change in 1983, after a jury awarded $2.1 million to the widow of 
stockbroker Donald Hillman, who died in a head-on wreck on PCH just north of 
the McClure Tunnel. In the 1977 accident, a collision in the northbound lanes 
knocked a car head-on into Hillman's southbound vehicle, police reported. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, experts testified that 16 similar head-on crashes had 
occurred in the same stretch of PCH in the year preceding the Hillman accident. 
The jury found Caltrans liable for 75% of the damages. The $2.1-million verdict 
was appealed, and the state settled out of court for $1 million, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Within days of the 1983 verdict, Caltrans announced it would build a 
1,200-foot-long median barrier to separate the six PCH traffic lanes north of 
the McClure Tunnel. The barrier was designed to prevent cross-over accidents 
and unsafe U-turns. Owners of beachfront homes and the city of Santa Monica had 
requested such a barrier more than a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
State lawyers decline to talk about the PCH problems, because at least two 
lawsuits are pending against the state. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans lawyers acknowledged that in addition to the $1-million settlement, 
the state had paid out $350,000 in another, similar PCH case. They would not 
say how many other PCH liability suits had been brought against the state. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Irving Shimer has 
presided over three liability suits filed against the state after accidents on 
PCH. 
</P>
<P>
"More people will be maimed and killed (on PCH)," Shimer said from the bench in 
Santa Monica in January. 
</P>
<P>
He criticized Caltrans for trying to squeeze more traffic capacity out of the 
road by making lanes narrower while failing to make the highway safer. 
</P>
<P>
Shimer made the comments during the trial of a suit by two teen-age girls who 
were critically injured in a head-on collision. The three-car accident occurred 
in 1984 just north of the barricade built after the Hillman verdict. A van 
struck a car attempting to make a U-turn and then struck the girls' car, 
experts testified. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the girls noted that there had been 22 accidents during the 
previous five years involving cars that were either making a left turn or a 
U-turn in this same area. 
</P>
<P>
Carl McMahan, representing one of the girls, argued that the state, by earlier 
building the barricade, had acknowledged that the stretch of road was 
"unreasonably dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Had the structure been extended even farther, the girls' car would not have 
been hit, McMahan argued. 
</P>
<P>
Although Shimer has not ruled in the case, he said construction of the barrier 
had only "pushed the problem farther north." 
</P>
<P>
While declining to talk about specific accidents, Caltrans officials say they 
are trying to find solutions to problems along PCH. 
</P>
<P>
A variety of proposals have been discussed: building a double-deck freeway over 
the existing route or constructing a viaduct over the water. But these ideas 
were dropped because they proved too costly and controversial. 
</P>
<P>
The latest idea is a $37-million Caltrans proposal to create "reversible lanes" 
on the most congested five miles of PCH, north of the tunnel. In the morning, 
four lanes of traffic would flow south to the Santa Monica Freeway, with two 
lanes going north. Automatic pop-up cones and overhead signals would separate 
the traffic. In the afternoon, the flow would be reversed and four lanes would 
be northbound, engineers said. 
</P>
<P>
Skeptics point out that even if this solution did ease congestion, it would not 
solve the basic problem: there is not enough room between the bluffs and the 
beach to make way for more cars. 
</P>
<P>
"These little devices (barricades, narrower lanes or reversible lanes) are not 
going to solve the basic problem. . . . There are too many cars going too 
fast," Shimer said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PCH TRAFFIC CRUNCH 
</P>
<P>
From the Ventura County line to Santa Monica, Pacific Coast Highway is a 
congested and dangerous stretch of road. 
</P>
<P>
High bluffs are on one side; the beach, parking lots and expensive houses are 
on the other, making widening of the highway impossible. 
</P>
<P>
The most notorious segment of PCH is in Santa Monica, where the Santa Monica 
Freeway ends at McClure Tunnel. Motorists traveling west exit the tunnel onto 
the northbound three lanes of PCH, a congested stretch of undivided highway. 
There are no cross streets for two miles. "No U Turn" signs are everywhere. 
Turning around is nearly impossible. Southbound three lanes are also congested.

GROCER 'EVERYONE LIKED' SHOT TO DEATH IN HOLDUP

<TEXT>
<P>
Grocer Tomoji (Tommy) Matsuda, a month shy of his 71st birthday, clung fast to 
his little corner of North Main Street near Chinatown long after the other 
store owners moved away and graffiti began appearing at every turn. 
</P>
<P>
This is my neighborhood, he'd tell friends who shopped at Toni's Market on 
North Main at Ann Street. 
</P>
<P>
The area was battered and forgotten, changed to be sure. But he was proud of 
the three sons he had raised there and the name he had made for himself. 
</P>
<P>
Matsuda was shot and killed Monday on the same corner where he had worked and 
lived for 39 years -- a victim, some say, of the changes he turned a blind eye 
to. 
</P>
<P>
Toni Matsuda said her husband had chatted with a group of children who had 
bought candy before starting to restock the shelves. She was at a cash register 
in front and her husband was at the rear when a young man and woman entered 
late in the afternoon. Both were wearing black clothing and sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
"They had been looking at the spaghetti mix, waiting for the other customers to 
leave the store," Toni Matsuda said. "Then the man came over and pointed a gun 
at me and said, 'This is a stickup and get on the floor, flat.' . . . My 
husband thought that guy was going to kill us." Tommy Matsuda pulled the gun he 
kept for protection and ran to the front of the store. 
</P>
<P>
"It all happened so fast. I don't know who shot first. I saw my husband slump 
down. I ran to him and he was already bleeding a lot in the head. 
</P>
<P>
"The man told the woman, 'Go! Go!' but she just stood there, dumbfounded. He 
yelled 'Go!' another time and then they left. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't get anything." 
</P>
<P>
An unidentified customer was shot in the leg. 
</P>
<P>
Matsuda died shortly after 10 p.m. Monday at County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Toni Matsuda described the gunman as a Latino, about 25, about 5-feet-7, thin 
and well-groomed with short, dark brown hair. The woman was a Latina, also 
about 25, standing about 5-feet-6, also thin and with curly, shoulder-length 
hair. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always badgering them to move and come up to live with us," said 
Matsuda's oldest son, Dennis, 36, of Spokane, Wash. "But there were still a lot 
of people (in the neighborhood) that he felt close to. He knew a lot of people 
there and liked it. Everyone knew him. Everyone liked him. 
</P>
<P>
"The area always had its violent side. But I don't remember it being really 
this violent. I remember my dad commenting that it was getting more dangerous, 
that the people seemed to be getting more dangerous. But he didn't want to 
leave." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the curious gathered in front of the small grocery, named in honor 
of Matsuda's wife. A cardboard sign notified customers that the store would be 
closed through today. 
</P>
<P>
John Gardenas, 18, a resident of a housing project across the street, said 
Matsuda had worked at the store for as long as he could remember. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Tommy was there when my grandmother lived around here," Gardenas said. 
"He was nice. He spoke English, Spanish, Chinese. Everybody liked Tommy." 
</P>
<P>
Matsuda's wife said her husband was born in Japan and that his family 
immigrated to the United States from Peru in the 1940s. He spent a year during 
World War II in a detention center for Japanese-Americans, then moved to 
Denver, where he met Toni. 
</P>
<P>
They married in December, 1948, and moved to Los Angeles in 1950, choosing a 
lively area of "mom and pop" stores along North Main Street near downtown as an 
ideal spot to open a dry-cleaning business. The family lived for a while over a 
dry cleaner's on North Main, directly across from Ann Street Elementary, which 
the children would later attend. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know anything about dry-cleaning," Toni Matsuda recalled. "We 
learned it from the ground up. We brought up a son, then the twins came along, 
and later a friend of ours put us in the grocery business." 
</P>
<P>
In 1966, the Matsudas opened Toni's Market, catering to the nearby housing 
projects and the shrinking number of other residences in the area. 
</P>
<P>
By the 1970s, the neighborhood was changing. Other businesses closed or moved 
out, gangs moved in and the area took on a rougher look. 
</P>
<P>
The family eventually moved to another part of Los Angeles. But Matsuda refused 
to consider moving his business. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a very hard worker and he liked everybody," said Kenneth Yow Jr., who 
owned the grocery building. "He had been there so long that nobody gave him any 
problems. He knew everybody, and everybody knew him." 
</P>
<P>
But as the years passed, Yow said, Matsuda privately expressed concern over 
rising crime. 
</P>
<P>
"He knew it wasn't safe," Yow said. "But when you have to make a living, you 
have to put up with it." 
</P>
<P>
Yow said Matsuda, like other area merchants, "always kept a gun, because you 
don't know what is going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Funeral arrangements for Matsuda were incomplete Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Toni Matsuda said she was not sure if she would return to the grocery to work. 
She said longtime customers had been calling to express their condolences. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no bitterness toward the neighborhood," she said. "I don't hold it 
against anybody because two crazy people do something like this. 
</P>
<P>
"It was never a place to be scared. You can't blame a neighborhood when 
something like this happens."

LATINOS URGE BOARD TO SETTLE REMAP SUIT WITH NEW DISTRICT; 
</P>
<P>
VOTING RIGHTS: COALITION ASSAILS SUPERVISORS, ESPECIALLY SCHABARUM, URGING THEM 
NOW TO 'DO THE RIGHT THING.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A coalition of Latino politicians and community leaders confronted the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday with a packed hall of vocal 
supporters and a bitter demand that the board settle the festering voting 
rights lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The group accused the board of diluting Latino voting strength through the 
drawing of district lines and singled out Supervisor Pete Schabarum for what 
they said was a "cynical" and "malicious" maneuver to keep Latino politicians 
from running for his seat. 
</P>
<P>
In waiting until the last minute to disclose that he would not seek reelection, 
Schabarum left Latino elected officials little choice but to file for 
reelection to their own offices, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Coalition leaders implored the board to use the opportunity afforded by 
Schabarum's retirement to "do the right thing" by settling the lawsuit and 
redrawing district boundaries to improve the chances of a Latino winning a seat 
on the five-member board. 
</P>
<P>
The group -- led by U.S. Rep. Esteban Torres (D-La Puente) and Los Angeles City 
Council members Gloria Molina and Richard Alatorre -- said the Latino community 
is united in its demand for a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Its leaders said that a Latino has little chance of winning in Schabarum's 1st 
District in the June 5 election -- and they do not intend to field a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
"None of us will run, or support those who do, until the (voting rights) issue 
is resolved," Molina said. "We will settle for nothing less." 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Latinos, many of them bused in by churches and community groups, 
packed the regular Board of Supervisors meeting. When they loudly applauded 
Molina and the other speakers, Board Chairman Schabarum repeatedly pounded his 
gavel and threatened to recess the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the public appeal, the supervisors took up the settlement issue in a 
private, executive session and continued the matter for a week. 
</P>
<P>
The redistricting trial continued Tuesday in federal court despite the calls 
for settlement. The suit by the Justice Department, the Mexican American Legal 
Defense and Educational Fund and the American Civil Liberties Union alleges 
that the supervisors drew district lines in a way that violates the voting 
rights of Latinos and prevents a Latino from being elected to the board. 
</P>
<P>
At the board meeting, the calls for settlement were openly resisted by a 
majority of the board. Supervisor Deane Dana -- who had supported an 
unsuccessful attempt to settle the suit last December -- on Tuesday joined 
conservatives Schabarum and Mike Antonovich in arguing against settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Dana and Antonovich said that even if district lines must be redrawn, they 
prefer to do it after the 1990 Census is completed and better data is 
available. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors Kenneth Hahn and Ed Edelman had expressed hope that Schabarum's 
decision not to seek a fifth term in June's election would make it easier to 
resolve the redistricting dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The board's deep divisions were evident even as they debated procedural points. 
Hahn wanted the Latino speakers to be placed high on the meeting agenda, while 
Schabarum wanted them to follow other business. 
</P>
<P>
As Torres assured Schabarum that he would be brief, the crowd suddenly broke 
into a standing applause and loud hoots and whistles that lasted more than two 
minutes and silenced the board. 
</P>
<P>
Torres, Molina and Alatorre were then invited to address the supervisors, 
though Schabarum warned the crowd that he would have them all ejected and the 
meeting recessed if there was another outburst. 
</P>
<P>
Torres said Schabarum's decision has provided the board with an opportunity to 
reverse what he said was systematic denial of voting rights for Latinos. He 
encouraged the board to carve a predominantly Latino district from Schabarum's 
district. 
</P>
<P>
As Schabarum sat impassively, Torres and Molina attacked him for keeping his 
election plans secret. 
</P>
<P>
Torres was interested in running for supervisor but had to file for reelection 
to the House of Representatives on Thursday -- one day before the filing 
deadline for Schabarum's seat. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum took himself out of the race only after he was certain that "an 
uppity Mexican-American didn't file," Torres alleged. 
</P>
<P>
Molina said that Schabarum's last-minute decision "if innocent in intent was 
nonetheless malicious in effect." 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre, an expert on redistricting, said it is time for the supervisors to 
"rise above the pettiness that sometimes goes along with redistricting." 
</P>
<P>
Then he turned to Schabarum and said, "Let's do the right thing, Pete." 
</P>
<P>
During the debate, Dana tried to reassure Latinos by saying: "We have a very 
fine Hispanic (running for office) that you should get behind -- Sarah Flores." 
Flores is a Schabarum aide. 
</P>
<P>
Torres labeled Dana's remarks "condescending" to Latinos and said: "The 
community needs to make its own choices." 
</P>
<P>
When Antonovich also suggested Latinos back Flores' candidacy, there was a loud 
round of boos. 
</P>
<P>
Today at 5 p.m. is the deadline for candidates to file papers to run for the 
1st District seat, which includes the San Gabriel Valley. By late Tuesday, nine 
candidates had taken out papers to run for the seat, including former U.S. Rep. 
Jim Lloyd, Superior Court Judge Gregory O'Brien and Flores.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: INTERIM POLICE CHIEF RESIGNS AFTER 4 MONTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kelson McDaniel, who has served as interim police chief in Pomona since Nov. 
15, has resigned effective Friday, City Administrator Julio Fuentes announced 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes would not discuss the reasons for the resignation, and McDaniel was 
unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
A former police chief in San Clemente and Los Alamitos, McDaniel had applied 
for a permanent appointment as Pomona's chief but was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes recommended to the City Council a month ago that the city hire Lloyd 
Wood, Azusa's police chief, but Wood withdrew his application on Monday. Wood 
said that after prolonged negotiations with the Pomona council over an 
employment agreement, it became clear to him that he could not obtain the 
council's full support. 
</P>
<P>
After McDaniel leaves, Capt. Jack Blair will assume temporary command of the 
Police Department and its 171 sworn officers. The search continues for a 
permanent chief.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 STYLISH SUSPECTS HELD IN BANK HOLDUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men wearing "top of fashion" clothes were apprehended by police Tuesday 
after they allegedly held up two banks, one on Wilshire Boulevard and the other 
in Century City. 
</P>
<P>
"They were always wearing something at the top of fashion . . . , " said Los 
Angeles Police Detective Sgt. Jim Grayson. "(Tuesday) they wore black fedoras, 
silver-gray suits, white shirts and ties. 
</P>
<P>
The whole idea was to keep people from looking at their faces." 
</P>
<P>
One suspect, Kevin F. Stone, 28, was booked in the jail ward at County-USC 
Medical Center, where he was being treated for bites from a police dog who 
found him hiding behind a fence in West Los Angeles still holding a bag with 
$3,300 reportedly taken from a Wells Fargo office in Century City, Grayson 
said. The other suspect, Lawrence D. Griffey, 29, was captured by a motorcycle 
officer after a short chase. Grayson said Griffey had $700, believed taken from 
a Security Pacific office, in his socks.

ANTONOVICH OPPOSES PLAN TO DUMP SLUDGE IN ANTELOPE VALLEY; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE PROPOSAL TO SPREAD HUNDREDS OF TONS OF THE SEWAGE BYPRODUCT 
OVER FARMS IN THAT AREA ALSO ENRAGES ENVIRONMENTALISTS AND DRAWS COMPLAINTS 
FROM OFFICIALS OF NEARBY CITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
County Supervisor Mike Antonovich said Tuesday that he will oppose a plan by 
Los Angeles to spread hundreds of tons of sewage sludge over farms in the 
Antelope Valley, a proposal that also enraged local environmentalists and drew 
complaints from officials of nearby cities. 
</P>
<P>
"It is time the city of Los Angeles and its elected officials recognize they 
cannot use the Antelope Valley as a dumping ground for their garbage," said 
Antonovich, who represents the area. The supervisor said he would change his 
mind only if the plan were to draw "substantial community support." That seemed 
an unlikely prospect Tuesday. Antelope Valley environmental activists vowed to 
resist it while city officials in both Lancaster and Palmdale complained that 
they had not been told of the plan and doubted it would be approved by state 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Los Angeles, using a private firm, would truck up to 300 tons 
of sewage sludge a day -- more than 20% of the city's output -- to be used as 
fertilizer at five farm sites in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The state Regional Water Quality Control Board, meeting Thursday in Death 
Valley, had been set to approve the proposal. But a decision was delayed for 
two months after some board members complained that the sludge could 
contaminate the high desert region's crucial ground water supply. 
</P>
<P>
The federal Environmental Protection Agency and leaders of national 
environmental groups said that government agencies across the United States are 
increasingly looking to direct land application of sewage sludge as an option 
as landfills become scarce. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an issue that's exploding all across the country," said Douglas Rader, a 
senior scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund, a private, 
pro-environment group. "We're seeing hundreds and hundreds of these things 
coming out of the woodwork all over the country." 
</P>
<P>
Rader and EPA officials said that using sludge as a fertilizer can be 
beneficial and is preferable to dumping the mud-like substance into the ocean 
or landfills, as many cities still do. But they added that the treated sewage 
can contaminate ground water supplies and pose a health hazard if not properly 
regulated. 
</P>
<P>
Some environmentalists and city officials in the Antelope Valley, the 
fastest-growing region of Los Angeles County, see the issue in much simpler 
terms -- as yet another case of people from "down below" in Los Angeles trying 
to dump their problems somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the typical mentality about the high desert," said Lancaster Mayor 
Lynn Harrison, who said officials there did not know of the Los Angeles plan 
before Tuesday. She said city dwellers believe that "nobody lives there -- it 
doesn't matter." 
</P>
<P>
"They're always quick to get rid of what they don't want up here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure it's not going to go over very well with the community," added 
Palmdale City Administrator Bob Toone, who also said his city had not been 
previously told of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Toone said the proposal should have to approved by county planners, but Dick 
Frazier, a county supervising regional planner, said he saw nothing in the 
proposal that required county action. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just horrified. We are totally against this," added Stormy Williams, a 
Rosamond resident who heads an Antelope Valley environmental group called 
Desert Citizens Against Pollution. "They are not going to get anywhere on this. 
Everyone in the valley will unite on this." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles officials, who are backing the plan with a private company, Bio Gro 
Systems Inc., insist that the sludge program is environmentally safe and 
actually recycles what has been a waste product. The city now trucks 950 tons 
of sludge a day to farms in Riverside County and Yuma, Ariz., but wants to 
divert about a third of that to the closer Antelope Valley to save money on 
trucking costs. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles and Bio Gro officials said they could understand public concern 
over the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the public perception of sludge, we are fortunate to be regulated 
enough that we can be confident it is a good program," said Carol Pavon, Bio 
Gro's monitoring manager. 
</P>
<P>
She acknowledged that Bio Gro, although it has been pursuing the Antelope 
Valley proposal for nearly a year, until now had not discussed the plans with 
the public or city officials in Lancaster and Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
But now, she said, "If they are interested in it, we're certainly willing to 
talk."

BUSH SEEKS LATIN AID FROM PENTAGON BUDGET; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS: HE ASKS FOR $800 MILLION IN CUTS TO HELP NICARAGUA AND PANAMA. AND HE 
WANTS IT IN TWO WEEKS. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush on Tuesday proposed cutting the defense budget by $800 million 
to finance aid to Nicaragua and Panama, and he gave Congress two weeks to 
negotiate a deal with his aides on which programs to reduce. 
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua would receive $300 million of the funds, Bush said. The 
Administration earlier this year asked for about $500 million in cash aid for 
Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also signed an executive order lifting the trade embargo imposed on 
Nicaragua by the Reagan Administration and said he will provide an immediate 
$21 million in food and other humanitarian aid to that country. He also plans 
to request $200 million for Nicaragua next year, he said in a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
The aid "is urgent to advance the prospect for democracy" in both countries, 
Bush said. "Damage to both economies has been great. We must help." 
</P>
<P>
The package quickly put congressional Democrats in a bind, drawing pained 
comments from Capitol Hill leaders such as Rep. John P. Murtha (D-Pa.), 
chairman of the House panel that appropriates defense funds. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be a real painful exercise," Murtha said. "It's going to be 
very, very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
"We want to work with them and do it as soon as possible," said House Speaker 
Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.). But, he added, "I don't really accept the artificial 
deadlines." 
</P>
<P>
The reaction from Congress underlines the complications of cutting the defense 
budget and using the resulting "peace dividend" to fund new programs. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats have called for cuts in defense, and many have spoken in favor of aid 
to the new governments in Panama and Nicaragua. However, the list of defense 
projects that the Administration would like to cut includes many that are 
special favorites of powerful members of Congress, both Democrats and 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
And many members of Congress who would like to cut the defense budget would 
prefer to see the savings spent at home, rather than on foreign aid programs, 
which have never been popular with voters. 
</P>
<P>
If Congress and Administration negotiators cannot reach agreement by March 27, 
the President said, he will ask for authority to make the cuts unilaterally. 
</P>
<P>
That statement presented the Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill with an implied 
threat that if they do not move quickly, Bush will accuse them of letting 
pork-barrel considerations override the need to help emerging democracies in 
Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
"These nations need our help to heal deep wounds inflicted by years of strife 
and oppression, years of loss and deprivation," Bush said. "We must act and act 
soon." 
</P>
<P>
He added that "there is a sense of urgency" in the aid requests from Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Panamanian officials have been complaining that U.S. aid has been slow to 
arrive, and President Guillermo Endara publicly fasted to protest the delay. 
The White House in January asked for about $1.1 billion in aid for Panama, but 
more than $500 million of that was in the form of trade preferences and other 
incentives. The request for $500 million in cash is still under review in 
Congress, with lawmakers complaining that the Administration has been slow in 
answering questions about the program. 
</P>
<P>
"As recently as just a few hours ago, we could not get the Administration to 
answer the two basic questions on Panama: Where is the money coming from, and 
where is it going?" Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone is going to vote for it until they know what it's going 
to be spent on," added Leahy, who chairs the Senate panel handling foreign aid 
appropriations. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration wants very much to have the aid package for Nicaragua passed 
by Congress and ready to go by the time President-elect Violeta Barrios de 
Chamorro takes office April 25. The prospect of U.S. aid was a major part of 
Chamorro's U.S.-supported campaign against the Sandinistas. 
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan aid package would include money to help stabilize its currency, 
fund economic development, pay for emergency fuel, medical and agricultural 
supplies and clear up some of the debt the country owes to the World Bank and 
other international financial institutions. U.S. law restricts American aid to 
countries that owe money to such bodies. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also wants to provide about $45 million to help resettle Contra soldiers 
and refugees. Bush said he is still "concerned" by the reluctance of the 
Contras to surrender their weapons and return to Nicaragua from their camps in 
Honduras. But, he added, he is "less concerned than I was about the peaceful 
transfer of power" in Nicaragua after hearing from Vice President Dan Quayle on 
his meetings with President Daniel Ortega. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega met with Quayle on Monday in Santiago, where both were attending 
inaugural ceremonies for Chilean President Patricio Aylwin. Ortega promised 
that the transition to Chamorro's government will be peaceful and that the 
Sandinistas will not try to prevent her from appointing new defense and 
interior ministers. 
</P>
<P>
There is considerable support in Congress for aiding both Nicaragua and Panama. 
But finding the money to pay for the new aid is far more complicated. The 
Administration last month submitted a list of about $2 billion in defense 
projects that it would like to see removed from the budget Congress approved 
late last year. On Tuesday, the Pentagon provided a list of $300 million more 
in "newly identified sources of savings" that could also be used to fund the 
aid package. 
</P>
<P>
Both lists, however, target many spending programs supported by key lawmakers 
-- construction programs on military bases, for example, or weapons programs 
that provide large numbers of jobs. In addition, lawmakers say the 
Administration in some cases has tried to offer some of its proposed "savings" 
for more than one program -- a form of double counting that has created 
considerable confusion.

BUSH PROPOSES 'FUND FOR DEMOCRACY' 
</P>
<P>
 President Bush has proposed an $800-million Fund for Democracy that would 
disburse $300 million in aid to Nicaragua that he requested Tuesday and $500 
million in aid for Panama that he requested in January. The aid would be 
distributed as follows: 
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua ($300 million *) 
</P>
<P>
$75 million to help support currency. 
</P>
<P>
$60 million for development projects, including building schools, repairing 
roads and helping fund independent courts and police forces. 
</P>
<P>
$60 million for emergency aid to the economy, including seeds, fertilizer, farm 
equipment, oil and medical supplies. 
</P>
<P>
$45 million to help resettle Contra fighters and refugees. 
</P>
<P>
$50 million to help eliminate $234 million in debts Nicaragua owes to 
international financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
$10 million for emergency employment aid. 
</P>
<P>
$1 million for technical assistance in economic management. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Panama ($500 million) 
</P>
<P>
$45 million in loans to businessmen to rebuild inventories looted immediately 
after the U.S. invasion. 
</P>
<P>
$130 million to help eliminate debts Panama owes international financial 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
$185 million to help Panama dismantle state-run monopolies that Noriega 
established, which U.S. officials say are hampering economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
$140 million to help repair or rebuild roads and bridges that languished during 
the Noriega years or were blown up during the U.S. invasion. 
</P>
<P>
* Because of rounded-off figures, Nicaragua aid breakdown totals $301 million.

HAWTHORNE POLICE, BIKERS PLAY OUT CONFLICT IN COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL McGRAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ed (Fat Eddie) Serna had ridden with the toughest of them in his years with the 
Vagos, a band of notorious bikers formed in the 1960s to fight off the outlaw 
Hells Angels. But nothing from his biker days quite compared to the shock of 
what he says happened to his motorcycle at the hands of Hawthorne police. 
</P>
<P>
Serna said the lovingly restored 1948 Harley Davidson was confiscated in a raid 
and returned months later in pieces -- its motor rusted, the shift rod broken, 
the chrome pitted, a new paint job scratched, the taillight smashed, the 
carburetor torn loose and the seat missing. The mere sight of the disassembled 
machine, he said, plunged him into a lengthy despondence that almost wrecked 
his marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Serna, since retired from the Vagos, is among 70 plaintiffs seeking at least $3 
million in damages against the Hawthorne Police Department for alleged 
emotional distress and violation of their civil rights. The plaintiffs, who are 
being represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, are also seeking a 
permanent injunction prohibiting Hawthorne police from harassing the Vagos and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
"It was in real bad shape," Serna testified, recalling when his beloved Harley 
was returned to him. "I felt very angry. I worked four years on it and was that 
close to driving it, and it was taken away." 
</P>
<P>
The trial, which is now in its fourth week before Los Angeles Superior Court 
Judge Maurice Hogan Jr., is expected to end in May. It is a study in contrasts. 
</P>
<P>
The police officers, with their neatly trimmed hair and mustaches, stride into 
the courtroom impeccably dressed in business suits and carrying leather 
briefcases. They rarely talk with anyone but their attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The bulky, bearded bikers, with such nicknames as "Panhead," "Puff" and "L.A. 
Lenard," come attired in ragged jeans and T-shirts with an occasional beer 
belly peeking out from underneath. When a reporter asked ACLU attorney Paul 
Hoffman why he didn't "dress up" his witnesses, as some other attorneys do when 
in trial, he replied: 
</P>
<P>
"They are what they are. This case isn't about how they look, but what the 
police did to them." 
</P>
<P>
The case stems from two raids that occurred in August and September of 1983, 
when police searched 43 homes in 14 cities looking for a Vagos member named 
Raymond (South Bay Ray) Malloy, who was suspected of stabbing three patrons in 
a bar. 
</P>
<P>
The police did not find Malloy at any of the homes they searched, but they did 
find a housewife stepping out of the shower, a mentally handicapped girl, a 
licensed child-care operator tending five babies, past and present Vagos 
members, and others who said they had never heard of Malloy or the Vagos. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses have testified that during the raids, police broke down doors, 
brandished guns in the faces of children, called them obscene names, used 
unnecessary force to detain them, trashed their homes, made false arrests, and 
confiscated motorcycles, cars, photo albums and other personal items. 
</P>
<P>
Named in the suit, filed jointly by the ACLU and attorney Joanne Bockian of 
Sierra Madre, are former Hawthorne Police Chief Kenneth R. Stonebraker, three 
of his lieutenants, a sergeant and numerous unnamed officers who participated 
in the searches. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the ACLU's case is the allegation that Hawthorne police lied in 
affidavits so they could obtain search warrants to conduct the manhunt for 
Malloy. The ACLU contends the raids were conducted merely to harass the 
families so that Malloy would be pressured into giving himself up. 
</P>
<P>
But Hawthorne police deny the allegations, contending they had good reason to 
suspect the Vagos were hiding Malloy, who also was wounded in the bar fight. 
Malloy eventually turned himself in to police. 
</P>
<P>
Police say they were acting on solid tips given to them by a Los Angeles County 
sheriff's detective and an informant, and from addresses and phone numbers they 
obtained from the Sheriff's Department and even some members of the Vagos. 
</P>
<P>
"They weren't going to a convent with those search warrants," said John Daly, a 
Los Angeles attorney hired by Hawthorne to defend the city and its police force 
in the suit. "They (Vagos) were known violent people, and the police were 
knocking on doors with the expectation of finding Malloy, who had been accused 
of three vicious stabbings." 
</P>
<P>
Daly plans to call to the witness stand dozens of law enforcement officers, who 
are expected to testify that they used standard police procedures in conducting 
the searches, which they considered dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
The defense has painted the Vagos as an outlaw gang in which the men have long 
hair, the women tattoos, and members arm their homes with guns, knives and pit 
bulls. Through their own testimony, the Vagos have not denied much of that. 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU, while not attempting to paint the plaintiffs as saints, has focused 
its case on such civil rights issues as invasion of privacy, unlawful search 
and seizure, false arrest and excessive and unreasonable force. 
</P>
<P>
"The bikers' rights were violated," said attorney Bockian. "They have the same 
constitutional rights as everybody else in this country." 
</P>
<P>
As one trial participant noted, the courtroom drama really comes down to just 
one question: who were the meanest guys on the block -- Hawthorne police or the 
Vagos? 
</P>
<P>
A jury of seven women and five men will have to sift through testimony from 
nearly 200 witnesses. The trial's outcome may hang on testimony of four people: 
Hawthorne Police Lt. Steven Frazier, Vagos International President Lenard (L.A. 
Lenard) Barela, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. James Fosdyck, and former 
Hawthorne police Officer Dana Griffith, who now works for a motorcycle 
dealership in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Frazier is a 13-year cop whose lanky boyish looks earned him the nickname 
"Opie" because of his resemblance to Ron Howard's character on the old "Andy 
Griffith" television series. Frazier was the detective assigned to get the 
search warrants and find Malloy. 
</P>
<P>
Frazier is expected to testify that in obtaining the search warrants he relied 
on information from the Sheriff's Department -- specifically Fosdyck -- that 
the Vagos were hiding Malloy. 
</P>
<P>
Fosdyck, a 20-year deputy sheriff with steely eyes and sandy hair, disputes 
that. In clipped and unemotional sentences, he testified that he told Hawthorne 
police that the Vagos were not hiding Malloy. 
</P>
<P>
During cross-examination, the defense implied by its questioning that Fosdyck 
had a faulty memory, took no notes of his conversation with Frazier, and may 
have gotten in trouble with his superiors for giving out information on Malloy. 
</P>
<P>
Fosdyck said he had a meeting with Barela at a local Denny's restaurant during 
which the Vagos leader assured him that the bikers were not hiding Malloy. 
Barela is expected to buttress the detective's testimony when he appears as a 
witness in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Barela, a beefy man who said he joined the Vagos because many were Vietnam 
veterans like him who "felt lost," often wears checked flannel shirts and work 
boots to court. He alternately listens intently to testimony, dozes off, and 
talks proudly out in the court hallway about his Harley Davidson or a daughter 
attending UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth key witness is Griffith, whose curly, graying hair and cowboy-cut 
clothes make him resemble a country-Western singer. Griffith testified that his 
colleagues made unwarranted arrests, wrote false crime reports and brutalized 
suspects with the blessings of superiors. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith testified that Hawthorne police commonly participated in what they 
called "P.R." work, an acronym for "pound and release." This meant stopping 
suspects and "physically manhandling them to let them know their behavior 
should be modified." 
</P>
<P>
Under "P.R.," Griffith said, these people were not arrested, but "it made it a 
memorable event for them." 
</P>
<P>
Griffith also testified that when officers completed calls that involved 
blacks, Latinos, motorcycle gangs or whites of "low economic means," they would 
radio the station that the incident had been "N.H.I." -- a label meaning "No 
Human Involvement." 
</P>
<P>
In another instance, Griffith testified, officers stopped a suspected pimp on a 
traffic warrant. Some of the officers knew he was paralyzed and, as a joke, 
told a rookie officer that the man was faking it, Griffith recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"The officer dragged him out of the car through the window, and kept thumping 
him on his legs to get him to walk," Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
The treatment of the Vagos, he added, was no different. Early on in his job, 
Griffith said he was told by senior officers that "no Vago was to ride through 
Hawthorne flying their colors without being stopped." 
</P>
<P>
He said in one incident, an officer even faked a disturbance call into police 
headquarters so police could hassle a group of Vagos at a bar. After their 
arrests, Griffith said he was asked to fake the crime reports. 
</P>
<P>
Items confiscated from the Vagos -- jackets, knives and key chains -- were 
lined up on chairs in the station "like trophy displays," and city employees 
came by to admire them, Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
The defense has sought to undermine Griffith's credibility by saying Hawthorne 
police considered him a suspect in a murder and that he was allowed to resign 
from the force because of other unrelated allegations. Griffith denied the 
allegations and said he has never been interviewed by homicide detectives. 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU argues that the alleged "harassment campaign against the Vagos" was 
part of a larger pattern of police abuse in Hawthorne that occurred between 
1980 and 1983 -- a direct result of a conscious political policy of Chief 
Stonebraker and other city officials to get tough on crime. 
</P>
<P>
In those years, Hawthorne was a city in transition. 
</P>
<P>
Located 15 miles southwest of downtown Los Angeles, Hawthorne changed from a 
predominantly white, working-class city to one that is 40% minority. It faced 
several crises in the 1970s and early 1980s: budget deficits caused by the loss 
of employers, a grand jury investigation that was critical of the "Old Boys" 
network and nepotism in city government, and rising crime. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, in the city's six-square-mile area, there were 13 murders, 601 
robberies and 1,558 burglaries. The figures touched off alarm among several 
grass-roots groups, which demanded and got a reorganization of the Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
As pressure was placed on the 80-member Police Department to "clean up the 
city," Griffith said he witnessed excessive force and misconduct by police 
against the Vagos and others. 
</P>
<P>
The Vagos' run-ins with the law are legendary. Over the years, some members 
have been convicted of murder, rape, drug trafficking and other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
But to hear the Vagos tell it, the organization -- whose membership at times 
has exceeded 200 -- is not unlike the Rotary Club or other service 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Vagos, which means "drifters" in Spanish, elect officers, hold weekly meetings 
at their clubhouses, have secretaries who take minutes, and adhere to strict 
bylaws. 
</P>
<P>
Each member wears a green emblem on his motorcycle jacket depicting their logo: 
a devil astride a winged motorcycle. Vagos also pass out "courtesy cards" that 
bear their logo and names. 
</P>
<P>
Their wives and girlfriends adorn their own clothing with "property patches," 
which, as the name implies, indicate the wearer is the property of a Vago. 
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1983, as tensions rose between the Vagos and police, an 
incident occurred at the Country Girl bar on Hawthorne Boulevard that would 
ultimately trigger the raids and the resulting lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"South Bay Ray" Malloy and a friend confronted three Latinos who were playing 
pool and told them to "talk English," according to a police report. A fight 
ensued and all four suffered knife wounds. 
</P>
<P>
In October, 1983, Malloy turned himself in to sheriff's deputies. Authorities 
at the time said Malloy told them he was afraid of being picked up at his job. 
Malloy later claimed self-defense and pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of 
assault and battery and was sentenced to 142 days in jail and placed on five 
years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on search warrants, a force of 50 police officers, including two SWAT 
teams from various police departments around the Southland, conducted 
simultaneous raids on the mornings of Aug. 9 and Sept. 7. 
</P>
<P>
In one of those raids, Barela's former wife, Suzanne, testified that police 
"scared my children with their guns . . . threatened to shoot the dog . . . had 
a good ol' time hanging my lingerie from curtain rods . . . paraded me in my 
nightgown outside in front of neighbors . . . and called me a (obscenity) lying 
(obscenity)." 
</P>
<P>
She alleged that officers also said to her: "Since you are Lenard's old lady, 
were you passed around to the brothers?" 
</P>
<P>
"They told me to give Ray Malloy a message," she recalled. "That if he didn't 
turn himself in, they'd keep kicking in doors until he did." 
</P>
<P>
Malloy is the one person who may not testify at the civil trial, the ACLU's 
Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
The biker's attorney told Hoffman: 
</P>
<P>
"Malloy doesn't want to have anything to do with any of it."

IT'S ALL DONE WITH MIRRORS; 
</P>
<P>
TWO NEW TECHNOLOGIES FOR BIGGER TELESCOPES ARE REVOLUTIONIZING ASTRONOMY. THE 
SCIENCE IS ON THE BRINK OF AN EXTRAORDINARY ERA. 
</P>

<P>
Roger Angel hardly seems the type to lead a revolution. 
</P>
<P>
The soft-spoken, Oxford-trained astronomer prowls the corridors of the 
University of Arizona these days in the pullover sweater and corduroy slacks of 
the quintessential college professor. Part scientist, part inventor and part 
dreamer, Angel is the point man in the development of technology that has 
forever changed the world of science. 
</P>
<P>
The 49-year-old professor is the prime mover behind the university's mirror 
laboratory, a huge spinning furnace that melts glass and then allows it to cool 
and harden in the shape of a telescope mirror. But these are not just ordinary 
mirrors. These are giant mirrors that will peer into the darkest recesses of 
the universe, making new discoveries and rewriting the course of modern 
astronomy. 
</P>
<P>
The technology -- one of two new ways of building huge mirrors -- saves endless 
months of costly grinding and it is enabling scientists to build telescopes far 
larger than considered possible just a few years ago. It is very different from 
another new technique, favored by many European scientists, which involves 
creation of a very thin mirror that bends and warps to maintain a near-perfect 
shape despite changing temperatures and the high winds that howl through 
mountaintop observatories. 
</P>
<P>
The two technologies are competing for the lead role in the old art of 
telescope design -- but no matter which one wins, the world of astronomy stands 
on the brink of an extraordinary era. 
</P>
<P>
Just a few years ago, funding had all but dried up for new telescopes, and 
astronomers were watching one proposal after another go on the shelf because of 
a lack of money. Funding is still tight, but new technology is bringing the 
cost down, and astronomy is enjoying extraordinary popular support. 
</P>
<P>
"The science is very compelling," said Wayne Van Citters, program director for 
astronomical instrumentation development of the National Science Foundation, 
which is funding several new scopes. "The scientists can make a hell of an 
exciting case." 
</P>
<P>
Citters acknowledges that public support has played a role in increasing the 
funding. "People are interested in astronomy," he said. "They can understand 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Distant celestial objects that appear as no more than pinpoints of light in 
today's largest telescopes will show up in detail in the new mega-scopes, 
opening worlds that no one has ever seen before. The giant ground-based 
instruments will work in concert with orbiting observatories, including the 
Hubble Space Telescope scheduled for launch next month. The Space Telescope, 
for example, will be able to find objects so small that no one has ever seen 
them before, but it will take the huge mirrors of the new ground-based 
telescopes to capture enough light to really study the new discoveries. 
</P>
<P>
Progress has come so quickly that the 10-meter Keck Telescope now being built 
by Caltech and the University of California atop Hawaii's Mauna Kea may have a 
very short reign as the world's largest telescope. The Keck Telescope, which 
will use 36 individual mirrors in an array that makes them comparable to a 
single mirror more than 32 feet across, will be completed sometime next year. 
</P>
<P>
But that's only the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"The '90s will be a true golden age for the construction of large telescopes," 
Pat Osmer, deputy director of the National Optical Astronomy Observatories, 
told a recent symposium here sponsored by the International Society for Optical 
Engineering. The National Optical Astronomy Observatories, funded by the 
National Science Foundation, plans to build two 8-meter telescopes, one on 
Mauna Kea and the other in Chile, "to give full sky coverage" to American 
astronomers -- a goal that scientists could only dream about a few years ago 
because few thought it would be possible to fabricate such large mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
An 8-meter mirror is so large it would not even fit inside an oversized double 
garage, and it offers the hope of probing the darkest regions of the universe. 
That is because the larger the telescope, the more light it can gather. Thus a 
great instrument can "see" farther and study dimmer objects than lesser scopes. 
</P>
<P>
The twin observatories will be far larger than the 5-meter Hale Telescope on 
Palomar Mountain in northern San Diego County, which has dominated the world of 
astronomy for more than half a century. And even larger telescopes are in the 
advanced planning stages. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing on the drawing boards, however, matches the bold plans of a consortium 
of European countries that expects to build a complex of four 8-meter 
telescopes on a mountain peak in the Chilean Andes. The four scopes will be 
designed to work either separately or together as the equivalent of a single 
16-meter telescope. Thus, this giant telescope will have the light-gathering 
capability of a mirror 52 feet in diameter. That is more than three times the 
diameter of the Hale Telescope, the largest now operating in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The countries involved in the European project are Germany, France, Italy, 
Switzerland, Belgium, Holland, Denmark and Sweden, and funding has already been 
secured, according to astronomer Jacques M. Beckers of the European Southern 
Observatories. The project is expected to cost around $200 million, nearly 
twice the cost of the Keck Telescope. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a lot of money," Beckers said in an interview, "but it will be the 
world's most powerful telescope." 
</P>
<P>
The largest optical telescope in the world today is in the Soviet Union, but 
the 6-meter scope has been disappointing to astronomers, partly because of poor 
"seeing" conditions, as astronomers refer to atmospheric limitations on 
telescopes. 
</P>
<P>
American astronomers dreamed in the 1980s of knocking the Soviets from the top 
of the mountain by building the world's largest telescope, a complex of four 
8-meter scopes in a single mount. The New Technology Telescope, as it was 
called, was expected to dominate the world of astronomy. 
</P>
<P>
"But the funding climate was really bad," said Beckers, who was then one of the 
leaders in the effort to build the giant telescope. "It looked very grim. 
People decided the project was just too ambitious." 
</P>
<P>
So Beckers jumped ship and joined up with the Europeans. The U.S. project is 
dead, but the European "Very Large Telescope" is remarkably similar to the one 
that American astronomers had dreamed of. It is also quite different. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the U.S. design, which called for all four of the huge mirrors to be 
fixed in a single mount, and thus forced to focus on the same target, Europe 
will provide separate mounts for each of the mirrors. Thus the telescopes can 
work either together, or separately, or even with a number of other smaller 
telescopes that will be located around the main complex. 
</P>
<P>
The concept of blending the light from several telescopes into one beam, and 
thus greatly increasing the size of the scope, was pioneered by American 
astronomers with the "Multiple Mirror Telescope" in Arizona. That scope took 
the light from six mirrors and blended it together, thus using six smaller 
mirrors to work as a single 4.5-meter telescope. 
</P>
<P>
The Multiple Mirror Telescope was "experimental," according to astronomer 
Frederic H. Chaffee, director of the facility. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to know whether one could make a cluster of telescopes function as a 
single telescope," Chaffee said. "It worked extremely well. The astronomer was 
unaware of the fact that he was using six telescopes instead of one." 
</P>
<P>
Yet that telescope, which has been operational for only a few years, is already 
obsolete because of the rapid pace in the development of telescope technology. 
The six-mirror complex will be replaced by a new 6.5-meter mirror. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to abandon the multiple mirror scope, Chaffee said, came about 
because "we realized it would not be competitive in an 8-meter world." 
</P>
<P>
By using the existing dome and support facilities, and replacing the primary 
mirror with a larger one, the facility will join the front ranks of astronomy 
at a cost of only about $15.5 million, Chaffee said. A complete new telescope 
of that size, including a new dome, would have cost at least three times that 
much, he added. 
</P>
<P>
But putting a 6.5-meter mirror in a 4.5-meter telescope is a little like 
stuffing your size 9 foot into a size 6 shoe. It is possible, however, because 
of advances in telescope technology. 
</P>
<P>
The University of Arizona's spin furnace can create a huge slab of glass in 
about 24 hours with a surface that is curved enough to focus the light from 
distant stars very close to the mirror, thus greatly reducing the size of the 
support structure needed for the telescope. 
</P>
<P>
That not only lowers the cost of a large telescope considerably, it makes it 
possible to stick a big foot in a small shoe, as Chaffee plans to do with the 
Multiple Mirror Telescope by the end of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
However, the concept pioneered by the Multiple Mirror Telescope is far from 
dead, and many telescopes in the years ahead will look quite different from 
their predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the University of Arizona, Ohio State University and Italy are 
joining together to build powerful "binoculars" consisting of two 8-meter 
telescopes mounted side by side, according to Peter A. Strittmatter, director 
of Arizona's Steward Observatory. 
</P>
<P>
The twin mirrors will be equivalent to a single 11.3-meter telescope, so when 
it goes into full operation in 1996 it should rank as the largest in the world, 
at least until the Europeans finish their giant in Chile. The scope is expected 
to begin limited operations with the first mirror in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
The complex is supposed to be built atop Mt. Graham in Arizona, but 
environmentalists are fighting the project because they believe it will 
endanger the habitat of a rare squirrel and generally degrade the pristine 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Chaffee said the "binoculars" will use mirrors cast in the university's 
spin-furnace, and that is one reason why the project is expected to be 
completed at a relatively modest cost of $60 million. The reduced costs of the 
big mirrors, which Angel expects to bring down even more in the years ahead, is 
helping to make it possible for more and more universities to have their own 
major telescopes. 
</P>
<P>
The Carnegie Institution, for example, has joined with Johns Hopkins University 
and the University of Arizona in plans to build an 8-meter telescope, called 
Magellan, in Chile. Carnegie's Alan Dressler said he expects Magellan to cost 
about $45 million. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the high-tech Keck Telescope is expected to cost well over $100 
million by the time it is completed in Hawaii. That telescope will use 36 
hexagonal mirrors in an array that will be comparable to a 10-meter telescope. 
</P>
<P>
However, many scientists believe the real pacesetter in telescopes is a 
relatively small, 3.5-meter scope at the European Southern Observatory's La 
Silla facility north of Santiago, Chile. The New Technology Telescope began 
operations last March, and it has already produced images that have startled 
astronomers. 
</P>
<P>
The telescope uses a system of sensors and computers to bend the mirror so that 
its reflective surface remains nearly perfect, even when the temperature 
suddenly changes. That has permitted the telescope "to achieve the natural 
seeing limits," meaning it works better than any other telescope in the world, 
according to Masimo Tarenghi, the project manager. 
</P>
<P>
Sky and Telescope magazine recently called it "a telescope for tomorrow," and 
the European project has already strutted its stuff. 
</P>
<P>
During the Tucson meeting, Tarenghi showed an old photo of one area of the sky 
which included an object that all surveys list as a star because it appears in 
all previous images as just another point of light. But the image created by 
the new telescope revealed that it is not a point, but rather a swirl of light. 
Far from being a single star, it is a galaxy of billions of stars, worlds that 
no one even knew were there. 
</P>
<P>
The large mirrors built by Angel's group are in competition with the high-tech 
"active optics" favored by the Europeans, and no one knows at this point which 
will win out as the wave of the future. But no one doubts that the world of 
astronomy will never be the same again.

L.A. VOWS TO SEARCH FOR A TEAM TO REPLACE RAIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One day after the dramatic announcement that the Raiders are leaving Los 
Angeles, Coliseum commissioners and City Hall officials vowed Tuesday to 
quickly launch a search for a new professional football team, but there were 
signs that recruiting one will be long and difficult. 
</P>
<P>
As Los Angeles officials began to sort things out, following team owner Al 
Davis' decision and the approval of the move late Monday night by the Oakland 
City Council and Alameda County supervisors, these are the main questions they 
were asking: 
</P>
<P>
Can Los Angeles expect to attract a new team without a renovated Coliseum, 
including the luxury boxes and club seats the Raiders demanded before bailing 
out? The answer, both commissioners and the Coliseum's private managers agree, 
is no. 
</P>
<P>
Can the renovation be done before a pro team is committed to coming? The 
answer, officials say, is probably no. Without the assurance that a specific 
team will be playing in the facility at a certain date, it would be practically 
impossible to sell bonds to finance the project. 
</P>
<P>
Can any renovation be undertaken before the Raiders leave Los Angeles? 
Officials say the likely answer again is no, because the kind of project being 
considered would require teams to play elsewhere for at least one season. If 
the Raiders do stay through the 1991 expiration of their contract, they are not 
apt to settle for a temporary site. 
</P>
<P>
There were suggestions Tuesday that perhaps the Raiders and the Coliseum 
Commission will agree to terminate the playing contract early and let the 
Raiders go to Oakland this season or next. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Richard Riordan, for example, noted that lame duck teams 
traditionally fare terribly at the gate. "If the Raiders are going to lose 
their shirt and draw only 15,000 or 20,000 a game, what good does it do the 
city or the team for them to stay?" Riordan asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't met anybody yet who's sorry that they're leaving," Riordan added. 
</P>
<P>
In Oakland on Tuesday, officials said the Raiders were free to begin playing 
there early, even though it might compound the difficulty of arranging 
construction schedules for the planned $53.5-million expansion of 
Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland aides emphasized, however, that that city is doing nothing to tamper 
with the Raider-Coliseum contract. It is exclusively up to talks between the 
Raiders and the Coliseum Commission whether the Raiders buy themselves out of 
their lease early, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Coliseum Commission President Matthew Grossman, meanwhile, said it may be 
difficult to negotiate an early termination of the Raiders' lease in Los 
Angeles, given the $57-million suit that the commissioners have filed against 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
As options are explored, special meetings were called for Thursday of both 
Mayor Tom Bradley's business-oriented Committee to Support Professional 
Football and the Coliseum Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Mayor Mark Fabiani said Bradley would outline for his committee, meeting 
for only the second time, the options he thinks Los Angeles has. "The mayor's 
position is that the Coliseum Commission ought to go ahead with its renovation 
plans, so they'll be ready for a new team, or in the small chance the Raiders' 
move falls through," Fabiani declared. 
</P>
<P>
Getting ready for the future was also on the mind of Grossman. He said that 
when the commission meets, it will be to discuss the terms of a new agreement 
with the Coliseum's lead private manager, Spectacor, whereby Spectacor would 
continue to spearhead planning for a privately financed stadium renovation 
"sufficient to attract a professional football team and to satisfy the needs of 
USC." 
</P>
<P>
Grossman said the commission will certainly want to go forward with an 
environmental impact report that it has already taken steps to commission on 
alternatives for improving the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
As officials took the opening steps to try to recruit a new pro team, the man 
who was instrumental in recruiting the Raiders a decade ago, labor leader 
William Robertson, said he is not very optimistic about the prospects. 
</P>
<P>
"We have two options -- to try for an existing franchise or to seek an 
expansion franchise," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Going off the track record of this Coliseum Commission in dealing with its 
tenants, I think any operator of an existing pro team would take a dim view of 
the prospects of moving to the Coliseum. And, as far as an expansion franchise, 
we have to remember the National Football League is not friendly to L.A. After 
all, we joined with the Raiders on the antitrust suit against the league and 
cost them millions." 
</P>
<P>
In Oakland on Tuesday, city aides were still marveling over the impassioned 
five-hour public hearing that had been held the night before the Alameda County 
Board of Supervisors and the Oakland City Council approved the Raider deal, 
both on split votes. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw people at that hearing who never come to our council meetings," said 
Carol McArthur, press secretary to Mayor Lionel Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
At the hearing, hundreds of Raider supporters, mostly white working men and 
young people from blue-collar neighborhoods of Alameda, San Leandro, Hayward 
and other communities outside Oakland, were confronted by numerous residents of 
Oakland's black ghetto and its predominantly white hillside neighborhoods who 
were passionately opposed to the Raider deal. 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland Tribune found in a recent poll that 59% of those surveyed in 
Oakland thought it was "not important" to solicit the Raiders to come back, and 
scores of the 140 speakers at the public hearing Monday night took that 
position. 
</P>
<P>
Gwendoline Bishop, from Oakland's inner city, was one of many speakers who 
defied the jeers of Raider supporters to speak, telling the council members and 
supervisors: "I find it appalling that you would dare to waste our children's 
future by putting $600 million into the Raiders instead of the schools. What an 
example you are setting for the children, bringing in a man who personifies 
greed." 
</P>
<P>
But Henry Bruno, who followed her, said, "A favorable vote tonight on this 
proposal will demonstrate that Oakland's still a place where ideals live. 
Restore our heart and soul. Bring back the Raiders!"

SUPERVISORS DEMAND HALT TO THE SPRAYING; 
</P>
<P>
MEDFLY: ANGRY PETE SCHABARUM JOINS THE TWO DEMOCRATS ON THE BOARD IN APPROVING 
RESOLUTION AGAINST THE MALATHION CAMPAIGN. 
</P>

<P>
Angered by the continual flights of malathion-laden helicopters out of El Monte 
Airport, Pete Schabarum joined the Democratic minority on the Los Angeles 
County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday in approving a resolution demanding an 
end to the state's aerial spraying campaign against the Mediterranean fruit 
fly. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, which joins the growing number of anti-malathion resolutions 
approved by local governments, passed by a 3-2 vote after two hours of 
emotional debate between state officials and several dozen malathion opponents. 
</P>
<P>
The largely symbolic measure was supported by Schabarum and Supervisors Kenneth 
Hahn and Ed Edelman, its author. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors Deane Dana and Mike Antonovich opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope somebody gets the message that it takes two to tango," said Schabarum, 
who attacked the state's repeated refusal to move the spraying operation out of 
El Monte Airport. "I'm sick and tired of this. You've told me for some weeks 
that you could care less about my problems, so I'm not going to be responsive 
to your needs anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum's vote in favor of the resolution was greeted with a gasp from 
malathion opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Henry J. Voss, director of the state Department of Food and Agriculture, said 
he was disappointed by the board's decision, but added that it will have no 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't do anything," he said. "I think we heard what they had to say and 
will try to accommodate them. But this won't affect the (eradication) program." 
</P>
<P>
The board's vote came on a hectic day of activity by both the state and 
opponents of the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa filed suit Tuesday in Los Angeles federal court against the state, county 
and the Federal Aviation Administration, seeking a court order to stop the 
nighttime spraying of malathion. The suit, which claims the state's Medfly 
eradication program violates federal environmental, aviation and other laws, 
seeks an injunction requiring Azusa's written approval for spraying below 300 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, Huntington Beach renewed its attack against the spraying with 
a request to the state attorney general and the county district attorney that 
they prosecute the helicopter company contracted by the state for violating 
Proposition 65, the state's anti-toxic law. 
</P>
<P>
The beach city was one of the first to sue the state to stop the spraying, 
although its suit was rejected in Sacramento Superior Court. Deputy City Atty. 
Arthur De La Loza said San Joaquin Helicopter Service is being pursued because 
Proposition 65 excludes state agencies from prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
"The Department of Agriculture officials have already admitted that traces of 
harmful chemicals are in malathion," De La Loza said. "Now, under Proposition 
65, we are shifting the burden of proof to them to show that health is not 
being threatened." 
</P>
<P>
The state launched its own counterattack Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Assistant Atty. Gen. Andrea Ordin said that the attorney general's office 
has not found any toxic substance sufficiently high in malathion to make it 
come under Proposition 65. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian, in an unusual radio address, spoke on KNX radio to 
rebut an editorial from the station demanding that the state prove malathion's 
safety. Deukmejian, who has made few public statements on the issue, said: 
</P>
<P>
"I am aware of those who are concerned about the efforts to eradicate the 
Medfly. But our program is safe and it works. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It is time that our anger be directed at those who are illegally bringing the 
Medfly into California, not at those who are trying to stamp it out." 
</P>
<P>
The state attorney general's office also requested a court order Tuesday to 
prevent Pasadena and Azusa from enforcing ordinances against low-flying 
aircraft. The ordinances were designed to sidestep the state's authority to 
conduct aerial pesticide spraying, which is allowed under the emergency 
eradication order signed by the governor last year. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena already has cited the helicopter company conducting the spraying and 
intends to press its case in court. The pilots could face six months in jail 
and $500 fines if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Atty. Gen. Charles Getz countered that the ordinances have no legal 
power because only the federal government has the authority to control aircraft 
flights. 
</P>
<P>
The case is to be argued today in Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors' decision Tuesday was an unexpected victory for malathion foes, 
considering Los Angeles County is one of the main participants in the Medfly 
eradication program. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors conceded that their resolution will have little impact on the 
state, which has broad powers under the emergency eradication program declared 
by the governor. 
</P>
<P>
But Edelman said the resolution will send a clear message that the repeated 
spraying has become unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman attacked agriculture officials for dragging their feet in developing 
alternative ways of battling the pest, such as the increased use of sterile 
Medflies. He said that during an infestation in 1981 the supervisors passed a 
resolution demanding the state maintain a reserve of sterile flies. But last 
year when the current infestation erupted, the state quickly ran out of sterile 
flies and had to resort to aerial spraying. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have here is a failure of state policy," Edelman said. "I'm at the 
point where I'm saying we've got to stop the spraying. We want to eliminate the 
Medfly, but not with malathion." 
</P>

L.A. WILL SEEK TO REOPEN SUIT OVER CENSUS; 
</P>
<P>
UNDERCOUNTING: A FEDERAL JUDGE WILL BE ASKED TO HOLD THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT IN 
CONTEMPT OF A COURT-APPROVED SETTLEMENT TO ENSURE THE ACCURATE COUNTING OF 
MINORITIES, IMMIGRANTS AND THE POOR.

Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn announced Tuesday that the city will ask a 
federal judge to hold the U.S. Department of Commerce in contempt of a 
court-approved settlement seeking to ensure that minorities, immigrants and 
poor people are accurately counted during the 1990 Census that begins this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn asserted that the controversy over census procedures "has become the 
biggest civil rights issue facing the nation today." 
</P>
<P>
Hahn's action would reopen a 1988 lawsuit that charged the Commerce Department 
with illegally rejecting a technique that would lead to a more complete count 
of the people, mainly city dwellers, who traditionally are undercounted. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was filed jointly by several cities, including Los Angeles and New 
York, which stand to lose millions of dollars in federal aid based on 
population, as well as political representation, as a result of an undercount. 
A settlement of the suit was reached last summer when the Commerce Department 
agreed to reconsider the disputed technique and also agreed to set forth 
certain guidelines under which it might be used. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn is now accusing the Commerce Department of issuing a set of guidelines 
that all but doom the controversial technique. 
</P>
<P>
"The Commerce Department is guilty at best of bad faith," Hahn said, "and at 
worst of engaging in an active conspiracy to manipulate the census in order to 
undercount minorities and people living in poverty." 
</P>
<P>
According to Hahn's office, New York will join in renewing the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Commerce Department could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happens in the case, officials of the U.S. Census Bureau have 
indicated that the census will proceed on schedule with most American 
households starting to receive census forms during the last week of March and 
census takers following up on the mailing with visits to homes that do not 
return the forms. 
</P>
<P>
It is that approach, however, that plaintiffs in the lawsuit argue leads to 
undercounting the urban poor. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn's office contends that the 1980 Census, while undercounting only 1.4% of 
the nation's population, missed more than 9% of blacks in Los Angeles, nearly 
10% of the city's Latino population and more than 7% of Asian-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney said the undercount would shortchange the city by close to 
$150 million over the next decade. Much of that money, Hahn's office said, 
would go to housing and social service programs for the urban poor. 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning of the lawsuit, the plaintiffs have argued that the Commerce 
Department's action was politically inspired -- an attempt by a Republican 
Administration to cheat Democratically dominated cities of the money and 
increased political power that normally accrue to growing population centers. 
</P>
<P>
The technique, known as the post-enumeration survey, at issue in the lawsuit 
would offer a means of checking the accuracy of the census. Census takers would 
go back to 150,000 households, representing a broad spectrum of society, and 
compare what they found then with the initial head count. 
</P>
<P>
Where discrepancies surfaced, the Census Bureau would determine which of the 
two counts was accurate and a correction would be made. The corrections would 
be projected to neighborhoods with similar characteristics and become the basis 
for adjusting the nationwide census.

POLITICS: THE LEGISLATURE SCURRIES TO APPROVE BORROWING FOR SCHOOLS AND 
EARTHQUAKE REPAIR. BUT THEY STILL MAY HAVE MISSED THE DEADLINE FOR A PLACE ON

<P>
With their political brinkmanship about to blow up on them, lawmakers Tuesday 
finally approved and sent to Gov. George Deukmejian school construction and 
earthquake bond measures they hope to put up for a vote in the June 5 election. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all-but-unanimous approval in four votes in the Assembly and Senate on 
Tuesday, it was far from certain whether the Legislature acted in time for 
Secretary of State March Fong Eu to meet legal and printing deadlines to get 
the bonds on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
One of the measures is an $800-million bond proposal to provide money to 
construct schools, repair older ones and supply air-conditioning systems to 
year-round schools. It passed 70 to 0 in the Assembly and 30 to 0 in the 
Senate. The other measure would give state and local governments $300 million 
to finance earthquake repairs on public buildings and to earthquake-proof older 
structures. It passed 60 to 2 in the Assembly and 30 to 0 in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian is expected to sign both measures. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday was supposed to be the Legislature's deadline for passing the 
measures. Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti said Eu told him Friday, 
once it was clear the Legislature would miss the deadline, that it was 
"categorically . . . impossible" for her to meet deadlines required to get the 
bond proposals before voters in June. 
</P>
<P>
That position had softened somewhat on Tuesday after the Senate and Assembly 
actions, but there were still no guarantees from Eu's office that the bond 
measures would make the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"If it can be done, it will be done. We are still trying to determine whether 
it is possible," said Anthony Miller, chief deputy secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the two measures make the ballot, Miller said the Legislature's late 
action will cost taxpayers a minimum of $2 million because the state will have 
to prepare supplemental ballot pamphlets. The official ballot pamphlet, 
containing more than 100 pages of material on other bond measures, initiatives 
and propositions, already is too far along in the publication process to 
include the two late measures, Miller said.

legislative leaders agreed on Feb. 9 to put the school construction and 
earthquake bonds on the June ballot, along with $1.1 billion in other bond 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
The other measures were approved, but the school and earthquake bonds got 
bogged down in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers, asserting that schools needed more money, initially attempted to 
kill the earthquake bond measure in order to boost the school funding proposal 
to $1.2 billion. After that effort failed, the fight centered on efforts by 
urban Democrats to amend the school bond issue in a way that would allow 
construction and rehabilitation contracts to be steered to firms owned by women 
and minority contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly lawmakers seemed firmly deadlocked at the end of last week, but a 
massive lobbying effort over the weekend by parents, school districts, teachers 
unions and others turned the tide, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Late votes are nothing new on bond measures. The Legislature has been playing 
chicken with Eu's deadlines for years, running right up to and then past them. 
Despite missed deadlines in the past, the secretary of state's office always 
managed to get the measures on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, there is a feeling in the Legislature that Eu's deadlines are 
soft. One key legislative source, who asked not to be identified because of the 
sensitivity of his job, said: "(Officials in the secretary of state's office) 
said there were deadlines in the past, but they always managed. Nobody believes 
them anymore. That is one of the problems." 
</P>
<P>
This time, things might be different. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said the problem is compounded by a ballot pamphlet that is unusually 
long. It already contains 15 measures and is 112 pages long. The state printing 
office will begin printing 11 million copies of it March 21. 
</P>
<P>
The law requires that all the work must be done and the pamphlets be delivered 
to the Postal Service no later than May 15. Even at that, there is some doubt 
whether the Postal Service can deliver the 22 million pieces of mail, 
represented by the principal and supplemental ballot pamphlets, in time for the 
election June 5. 
</P>
<P>
Senate President Roberti (D-Los Angeles) said the Legislature's lawyers may 
ultimately have to go to court to force Eu to put the measures on the ballot if 
the secretary of state does not relent.

CHAVEZ JOINS ANTI-SPRAYING PROTESTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The issue was malathion. The setting was Santa Monica. The magnet was Cesar 
Chavez. And the result was a strikingly diverse protest -- a sort of 
disharmonious conversion of fruit pickers, tree preservationists, politicians, 
child advocates and futurists. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Forests Forever were there, as were the Mothers From East Los 
Angeles, Mothers and Others, Santa Monica Mayor Dennis Zane, Pesticide Watch, 
Kids Cry Out (a group of Los Feliz schoolchildren) and Four Directions, an 
American Indian organization. 
</P>
<P>
Hucksters sold Chavez posters, said to have been commissioned by Jane Fonda, as 
well as "Boycott Grapes" T-shirts and bumper stickers. 
</P>
<P>
"Today marks a milestone," Chavez told the cheering crowd outside Loews Santa 
Monica Beach Hotel, where California fruit growers and distributors were 
holding a yearly convention. 
</P>
<P>
"We're here to tell the pesticide traffickers we will no longer tolerate the 
spraying in silence. They talk about acceptable levels of exposure -- 
acceptable to whom?" the United Farm Workers leader asked. "There is no 
acceptable level of exposure to chemicals that may cause cancer, miscarriages, 
stillbirths . . . and death." 
</P>
<P>
The rally was organized by the Burbank-based group FOCUS, or Families Opposed 
to Chemical Urban Spraying. Nearly 200 activists -- chanting, waving signs, 
blocking traffic -- took part in what was described as a new alliance of farm 
workers and wealthy urbanites opposed to malathion spraying. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got Republicans and Democrats here, people from Santa Monica and East 
L.A., urban people and rural people," actress Julie Carmen said. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a "PEACE" T-shirt, with his long hair trailing out of a faded fedora, 
40-year-old Vic Forsythe of West Los Angeles stood with a bullhorn, leading the 
chants for picket-carrying marchers. 
</P>
<P>
"Stop the spraying! That's what we're saying!" 
</P>
<P>
Forsythe, president of the Vegetarian Society of Southern California, said he 
is upset that malathion is being used on private yards and patios, in stores 
and even on public buses. 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting to be too pervasive," he complained. "It's killing wildlife, 
killing birds. Once the birds are killed, there will be more insects. The 
insects will adapt (to the malathion). Then what?" 
</P>
<P>
Fruit growers, who watched the demonstrators through the hotel windows, took 
issue with the marchers. Michael Durando, president of the California Grape and 
Tree Fruit League, which represents more than 90% of the state's fruit growers 
and shippers, said he sympathized with the concerns of the protesters but still 
strongly supports the spraying program. 
</P>
<P>
"If we allow the Medfly to spread throughout California . . . we will see a 
dramatic reduction in the production of fresh fruits and vegetables in this 
state," he said. "You will have a situation where consumers will be be buying 
fruit in the market and cut into them and find maggots in them." 
</P>
<P>
Durando, who said the crop loss would reach several billion dollars in 
California, predicted that even back yard gardening would come to an end. 
</P>
<P>
"With the Medfly, there will be no real way for back yard folks to control the 
infestation," he said. "You won't see fruit coming off the trees. The worms 
will get it first -- the maggots." 
</P>
<P>
The UFW members, who already are mounting a grape boycott to protest the use of 
pesticides stronger than malathion, will join with anti-malathion forces in 
another boycott to be announced next week, said FOCUS leader Adelaide Nimitz. 
She declined to name the target of the boycott. 
</P>
<P>
"They will never eradicate the Medfly -- never," she said. "The Mediterranean 
fruit fly is established. It is sort of like the cockroach or the spider. To 
talk about eradicating them is ludicrous." 
</P>
<P>
Farm worker Gonzalo Ramirez, through an interpreter, told the crowd about the 
alleged effects of pesticides in the fields on his child. 
</P>
<P>
"My little girl was a victim of cancer," he said, requiring a kidney transplant 
from her brother.

PENTAGON WARNS OF A KREMLIN REVERSAL; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: DESPITE OPTIMISM OVER EAST BLOC CHANGES, THE JOINT CHIEFS URGE U.S. TO 
STAY STRONG. NATO WOULD HAVE 70 DAYS WARNING OF ATTACK IN EUROPE, REPORT SAYS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Pentagon's Joint Chiefs of Staff on Tuesday cautioned against too much 
optimism about changes in the Soviet Bloc and called for the United States to 
maintain a "hedge against a sudden reversal of events that could threaten the 
interests of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
In their annual "net assessment" of the relative military might of American 
forces and their potential adversaries, the nation's senior military officers 
conceded that sweeping changes throughout Eastern Europe would leave the 
Soviets "primarily on their own in any theater offensive." 
</P>
<P>
Already, the changes have given the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as many 
as 70 days' warning of an impending Soviet attack on Western Europe, the 
assessment said. 
</P>
<P>
But the United States still must maintain the ability to "surge" production of 
weapons, and the NATO alliance still must develop and field new nuclear weapons 
for use in a war in Europe, concluded the report, much of which remains 
classified. 
</P>
<P>
House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.) complained that the 
classified portions were more optimistic than those made public. 
</P>
<P>
He said that one of the classified report's most surprising findings indicates 
that NATO could defend against a Soviet military lunge at Western Europe 
without resorting to the use of nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon study was aired on Capitol Hill less than two weeks after William 
H. Webster, director of the CIA, told Congress that changes in the Soviet Bloc 
are virtually irreversible. 
</P>
<P>
Webster's testimony has fueled calls on Capitol Hill for deeper and more rapid 
defense cuts than those advocated by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney has held to his position that the United States, faced with the prospect 
of a reversal of Soviet reforms, must move slowly to scale back its military 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the split in his Administration in a press conference Tuesday, 
President Bush said, "I don't think anybody believes, including Cheney, that 
the Soviet system is going to go back to where it was." At the same time, he 
added, "we must retain a credible defense." 
</P>
<P>
In an apparent effort to end the near-public dispute between Webster and 
Cheney, Bush said, "I've talked to them now, and I feel that they are pretty 
close together." 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers, responding to the Bush Administration's mixed messages on changes in 
the Soviet Union, appeared uncertain of the report's significance. 
</P>
<P>
"Your classified statement sounds a lot more like Webster; your public 
statement sounds like Cheney," Aspin complained to Maj. Gen. John D. Robinson, 
director of the study. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at this net assessment, and I say we win!" Aspin said. "For the first 
time in history, (somebody's) come up with an assessment on the NATO-Warsaw 
Pact balance where we win." 
</P>
<P>
However, Robinson said that the United States and its allies must continue to 
modernize their short-range nuclear forces "while recognizing the political 
sensitivity of land-based short-range nuclear forces." 
</P>
<P>
Aspin also criticized the latest Pentagon assessment, completed in late 
January, for not taking account of political and military changes that have 
since tipped the balance further. As a result, he said, the 1991 defense budget 
request is "clearly out of date." 
</P>
<P>
In testimony before Aspin's committee, Robinson presented a picture of 
remaining Soviet military capabilities as "still . . . formidable," in spite of 
setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"Although unilateral force reductions have eroded their capability to conduct 
successful, substantial conventional operations against NATO, significant force 
advantages remain favoring the Soviets," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
As the Pentagon unveiled its study, a bipartisan group of Washington military 
experts called the proposed 1991 defense budget an "excessively cautious and 
inordinately expensive response" to the rapidly diminishing Soviet threat. 
</P>
<P>
The disintegration of the Warsaw Pact requires a restructuring of the U.S. 
military, starting with a reasonable goal of a 50% reduction in defense 
spending by the year 2000, said the group, led by Lawrence Korb, a Defense 
Department official during the Reagan Administration.

BONN FAVORS E. GERMANS' BENEFIT CUTS; 
</P>
<P>
EUROPE: THE CONTINUING INFLUX OF IMMIGRANTS FROM THE EAST IS CAUSING 
RESENTMENT. A CHANGE IN TREATMENT OF NEW ARRIVALS IS EXPECTED.

<TEXT>
<P>
The major West German political parties are lining up in favor of a crackdown 
on some of the benefits automatically extended to immigrants from East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The policy change is expected to be made after Sunday's national election in 
East Germany, according to political sources here. 
</P>
<P>
The continuing influx of East Germans, at a rate of more than 2,000 a day, has 
been an increasing source of friction in West Germany's affluent society as 
refugees from the East take up scarce living space in cities. Now a rising tide 
of complaint by West Germans that East Germans are straining their social 
services has forced the government to agree privately to cancel some benefits, 
such as preferential emergency housing, that are given the newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
Government sources said Tuesday that measures curbing benefits might be 
announced as early as this week. They said the issue is on the agenda of next 
week's Bonn Cabinet meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, Oskar Lafontaine, the premier of Saarland state and the 
opposition Social Democrats' likely candidate for the chancellery in West 
Germany's next national election, announced that his party would end most of 
the benefits given East Germans. 
</P>
<P>
Under his plan, incoming East Germans would receive pensions if they are of 
retirement age, but the pensions would not be as high as those for West Germans 
who spent their adult lives working for their own pensions. 
</P>
<P>
Further, he and other politicians have called for a wide range of measures that 
would keep East Germans from coming to the West. 
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine said the money used to provide emergency services to East Germans 
could be better spent building up East German roads and cities to help keep 
would-be refugees at home. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Wolfgang Mishnick, the leader of the Free Democrats, the 
junior partner in the West German governing coalition, declared that emergency 
housing for the "resettlers" should be stopped after Sunday's election. 
</P>
<P>
Most West German cities can absorb few additional immigrants, who are now 
housed in gymnasiums, converted freight containers, air raid shelters, church 
grounds and even on ships in ports such as Bremen and Hamburg. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-four cities and towns in the most populous state of North 
Rhine-Westphalia, including prosperous Duesseldorf, have imposed a two-month 
ban on newcomers from the East; others refuse to accept them altogether on the 
grounds that they are already overcrowded. 
</P>
<P>
Of the nearly 150,000 East Germans who have arrived in West Germany this year, 
only an estimated 10,000 had homes to head for. 
</P>
<P>
When the exodus from East Germany began last summer, many West German cities 
and citizens welcomed the newcomers, seeing them as brave young people fleeing 
Communist oppression. 
</P>
<P>
But with the razing of the Berlin Wall and the liberalization of the East 
German regime, most West Germans now view the newcomers as purely economic 
refugees looking for a better life. And the increasingly bitter feeling is that 
they are seeking that better life at the expense of West Germans who have 
worked hard for what they enjoy.

2 GERMANYS ARE ALREADY LINKED BY POLITICS AS ELECTION NEARS IN EAST;

<TEXT>
<P>
In the office of the East German political group Democratic Awakening, Ulrich 
Bente helps to design and market political ideas as part of the country's first 
free election campaign in its 40-year history. 
</P>
<P>
What makes Bente unusual is that he's a West German, a graduate student from 
Goettingen University, recruited by a West German businessmen's group to help 
Democratic Awakening push its free-market platform. 
</P>
<P>
He is one of thousands of West Germans who have been thrown into a campaign 
that has far more to do with the eventual shape of a future united Germany than 
with who leads a democratic East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
As an anxious Continent debates the conditions of German reunification, the 
present campaign stands as a striking example of just how close the two 
Germanys have already become. Five days before polling day, one of the more 
popular political statements remains a ubiquitous bumper sticker declaring, "We 
Are One People." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Ibrahim Boehme, the East German Social Democrat who could become 
prime minister, decided that his best media exposure was a news conference in 
Bonn. The same day, the deputy leader of West Germany's Social Democrats 
campaigned in the East German city of Jena. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the leader of West Germany's Free Democrats, Otto Graff Lambsdorff, 
spoke at a public rally north of Berlin, while West German Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl addressed an election rally in the mining city of Cottbus, barely 15 miles 
from the Polish border, which has triggered such controversy in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl's remarks Tuesday contained a startling change of tone on the issue as he 
repeatedly spoke of German respect for all international borders. 
</P>
<P>
"We want Poland to live within secure borders," he said. "That is the wish of 
the German people." 
</P>
<P>
Kohl also said he favored a one-for-one exchange rate for East German savings, 
bringing the two Germanys into agreement on a crucial question for the merging 
of their economies. 
</P>
<P>
"We want savers to know that when the change in the currency comes, it will be 
at one to one for them," he told the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl and other leading West German politicians consistently draw top advance 
billing and crowds of up to 100,000. They campaign here because the results are 
as important for them as for the East Germans. 
</P>
<P>
Political analysts believe success in East Germany for the sister parties of 
either the Social Democrats or Kohl's Christian Democrats could easily 
influence West Germany's own elections, scheduled for December. 
</P>
<P>
According to recent opinion polls, East Germany's Social Democrats and the 
Alliance for Germany backed by Kohl's Christian Democrats both seem to have 25% 
to 35% of voter support, although many voters remain undecided. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl's liberal-right coalition must also negotiate unification with the 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
"You will elect those whom we will negotiate (unity) with," Kohl told East 
German voters Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The power of West German politicians is not just that they know the game of 
campaign politics and can play to a political rally so much better than their 
long-oppressed East German counterparts. Long years of exposure to millions of 
East German television viewers have given them a celebrity status as useful as 
that of a movie star in an American campaign. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany's Social Democrats may be one of the leading parties in recent 
polls, but voters are hard-pressed to recall anything of significance that 
their leader, one-time bricklayer Boehme, has said. What they remember is the 
West's Willy Brandt, a former Social Democratic chancellor, in an emotional 
appearance on a balcony in Leipzig before a cheering crowd of more than 
100,000, or his election as the East German party's honorary chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl and West Germany's Free Democratic foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich 
Genscher, who was born in the East German city of Halle, play equally vital 
roles for their sister parties in the East. 
</P>
<P>
But West German involvement goes far beyond the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Mathias Gey, a Free Democrat candidate running in Frankfurt an der Oder, ran 
through the list of services provided from West Germany's Free Democrats that 
included placards, a big photocopier, paper on which to print news releases and 
volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
"It goes down to the smallest possible thing, like the frames for election 
posters," noted Martin Lucius, a West German Social Democrat helping in the 
East. 
</P>
<P>
The Communists, who have no such Western partner, have produced one poster that 
proudly proclaims, "NOT Made in West Germany." 
</P>
<P>
Among the most valuable assets from West German parties is a liberal supply of 
young volunteers with cars to carry election material to villages. 
</P>
<P>
Graduate student Bente, for example, helps with press relations, packages ideas 
and organizes distribution of information for Democratic Awakening, part of a 
three-party alliance supported by Kohl's Christian Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Such liberal use of West Germans in the campaign has drawn criticism and added 
to the East Germans' sense of being swamped by their rich Western cousins. The 
resentment occasionally boils into anger among East Germans over the fact they 
seem to have lost control over their first free vote. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of all this assistance is easy to see. 
</P>
<P>
The Social Democrats and the recently forged Alliance for Germany are by far 
the two strongest of the 24 parties registered for Sunday's election. New 
Forum, the coalition of interests that led last November's successful East 
German revolution against the Communists but has no West German political 
partner in the election campaign, has about 1% of voter support and says it can 
afford only four paid employees in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
The Social Democrats have between 35 and 40. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just a question of money or technology, it's a question of reaching 
the villages," said New Forum election worker Eva Reich. "They've got cars to 
get there and speakers to say the right things." 
</P>
<P>
Reich, wife of New Forum leader Jens Reich, admitted that it has been 
discouraging to see the group's support dwindle from the heady days of 
November. 
</P>
<P>
"They aren't voting Ebeling, Boehme or De Maiziere," she said of East Germany's 
voters, noting the last names of three major party leaders. "They are voting 
Brandt, Kohl and Genscher, and we've got nothing to compare with that."

The Hungarian Parliament has decided to rent out its rooms to help make ends 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators of the huge neo-Gothic building on the banks of the Danube River 
will rent out rooms for receptions and other functions "in the country's new 
entrepreneurial spirit," the state news agency MTI said. 
</P>
<P>
A large, richly decorated hall below the building's central dome will cost 
18,000 forints ($275) an hour, more than twice the average Hungarian's monthly 
take-home pay. 
</P>
<P>
Several state institutions have devised money-making schemes following budget 
cuts prompted by austerity measures. Earlier this year, the Interior Ministry 
said it had begun offering sniffer dogs and security guards for hire to help 
pay for the police force.

President Bush on Tuesday acknowledged "back alley" searches for information 
about U.S. hostages and predicted that the world will be "very, very 
fascinated" when the entire story can be told about his telephone call from a 
purported Iranian leader. 
</P>
<P>
Bush refused to provide any details. 
</P>
<P>
But one Administration official said the hoax phone call "came from a 
government building in Tehran . . . but no one knows who (it was)." A second 
official confirmed the gist of that comment. 
</P>
<P>
The President defended his decision to accept a telephone call several weeks 
ago from a man claiming to be the Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran's 
president. The caller wanted to talk about the eight U.S. hostages and other 
Westerners held in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
"What's wrong with reaching out and touching someone?" Bush asked.

AIDS PATIENTS MAY GET UNPROVEN DRUGS AT EARLY STAGES; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: ONLY ONE EXPERIMENTAL THERAPY IS NOW AVAILABLE OUTSIDE OF FORMAL 
STUDIES. AND ONE MUST BE CRITICALLY ILL TO BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE IT.

AIDS-infected persons could be eligible for promising but unproven experimental 
drugs at an earlier stage of the disease, according to the draft policy 
statement of a new federal program to provide access to drugs outside formal 
clinical trials. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the only experimental AIDS drug available to patients not in a 
formal study is the anti-viral drug DDI, and it is available only to critically 
ill patients who cannot take other therapies. But AIDS patients who cannot 
participate in formal testing of promising new treatments have argued in recent 
years that the choice of taking experimental drugs should be theirs, regardless 
of a drug's unknown potential to cause harm. 
</P>
<P>
A plan to expand that choice, known as "parallel track" trials, was announced 
last summer, but has not yet been implemented. Tuesday, details of how the 
proposed plan will work and who might be eligible were discussed at an AIDS 
conference sponsored by the Institute of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
"We are talking about people who are very clearly at high risk of serious 
illness in the immediate future -- people at a stage of infection where the 
risk from disease could be far greater than the risk of taking a drug very 
early in development," said Dr. James Allen, director of the National AIDS 
Program Office. "We are not talking about infected individuals with intact 
immune systems." 
</P>
<P>
Clinical trials typically compare patients receiving a medication to similar 
patients who either receive a different dose of the medication, another 
medication or no medication. Such comparisons allow the benefits and toxicities 
of a new medication to be accurately determined. These trials usually have 
narrowly defined and rigid criteria for entry. 
</P>
<P>
The "parallel track" program, on the other hand, allows individuals who are 
otherwise ineligible for formal clinical trials to have access to the same drug 
while the formal trials are proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
The risk in taking such drugs was demonstrated in recent reports that six AIDS 
patients taking the experimental DDI died of pancreatitis, a known toxic effect 
of the medication, in the five months since the government made the drug 
available to more than 8,000 patients early in the research process. On the 
other hand, experimental drugs can offer promise to terminally ill patients who 
have nowhere else to turn. 
</P>
<P>
The federal proposal discussed Tuesday says that the patient population 
eligible for parallel track will include those with fully developed AIDS and 
those "at imminent health risk due to HIV-related immunodeficiency." HIV, or 
human immunodeficiency virus, causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The virus can remain dormant in the body for several years before it begins to 
attack its primary target, the critical T4 cells of the immune system. As the 
level of T4 cells begins to deplete, individuals typically become vulnerable to 
a range of life-threatening infections and can become quite ill very quickly. A 
person with a level of 200 T4 cells or fewer -- normal is 800 to 1,200 -- would 
be considered "at imminent health risk." 
</P>
<P>
The language of the draft proposal was designed to "set out criteria (with) 
adequate flexibility" and does not necessarily mean that infected individuals 
without overt signs of illness would be automatically entitled to experimental 
drugs, said Allen. 
</P>
<P>
Under parallel track, an individual strategy will be developed for each drug, 
and a specific patient population will be defined for that particular drug, 
Allen said. He said that specific regulations will also be proposed to define 
circumstances and mechanisms to terminate expanded availability "since they 
(such mechanisms) do not now exist." 
</P>
<P>
"We need to try this as an experiment . . . ," he said. "If this is successful, 
there will be a lot of talk to extending it more broadly. But we need to 
restrict it at this time."

NORTH TELLS OF BUSH-IRAN PARLEY PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
CONTRAS: THE FORMER MARINE COLONEL TESTIFIES AT THE POINDEXTER TRIAL THAT HE 
DOES NOT KNOW IF THE THEN-VICE PRESIDENT WAS AWARE OF THE DISCUSSION.

Oliver L. North testified Tuesday that his hapless and hazardous flight into 
Tehran at the height of the Iran-Contra affair was originally conceived as an 
advance trip to prepare the way for "a senior Administration official -- 
perhaps even the vice president -- to meet with the leaders of Tehran." 
</P>
<P>
The testimony in the trial of retired Rear Adm. John M. Poindexter in U.S. 
District Court was the first mention that anyone considered such a role for 
then-Vice President George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
But, when asked if Bush, as vice president, had been aware of North's 
activities, the former Marine lieutenant colonel replied: "Counsel, I don't 
know which of the documents that I sent to Mr. Poindexter and Mr. McFarlane 
were sent to the vice president's office." Robert C. McFarlane was Poindexter's 
predecessor as national security adviser. 
</P>
<P>
North did acknowledge, as has been reported often, that Bush sent him a 
congratulatory note on Thanksgiving Day in 1985 that praised North's work as 
"one of the many things I have to be thankful for." 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter, who resigned as President Ronald Reagan's national security adviser 
in 1986, is charged with five counts involving a conspiracy to destroy 
documents, obstruct investigations and lie to Congress in the worst scandal of 
the Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Adding a touch of derring-do to his testimony about the May, 1986, Tehran trip, 
North also revealed that he had carried "a covert listening device" to 
"tape-record all of the meetings that I had with the Iranians and other 
intermediaries." North made the trip with McFarlane, who at the time was no 
longer a government official. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony about the Tehran flight was drawn out by Richard W. Beckler, 
Poindexter's defense attorney, who spent most of the day trying to coax the 
former national security officer into disassociating Poindexter from 
responsibility for most of the shadowy intrigue during those days in the White 
House. It was North's third day on the stand. 
</P>
<P>
But, although he agreed that Poindexter did not work hand-in-hand with him or 
telephone him every day, North insisted: "I did keep the admiral apprised of 
what I was doing." 
</P>
<P>
North, who was convicted last year of destroying documents and obstructing 
Congress, organized a complex operation in which the profits from the sale of 
arms to Iran were used to arm the Contras fighting in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Recalling the Tehran flight served Beckler's purpose because North, in the 
early stages of planning, had circumvented Poindexter by enlisting the support 
of McFarlane. Beckler's questioning has made it clear that he is trying to put 
much of the responsibility for the events on McFarlane, who pleaded guilty in 
1988 to withholding information from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
North testified that he had proposed a flight to Tehran with an advance party 
to prepare the way for high-level negotiations with the Iranians that could 
lead to freedom for the American hostages held by Iran-influenced Islamic 
fundamentalists in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
But "the admiral was very opposed to an advance trip," North testified. "He 
believed the risk was too great. I believed the risk was worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Without informing Poindexter, North testified, he sent a message to McFarlane 
in February, 1986, asking him "to importune with the admiral to make the trip." 
Although McFarlane was no longer a government official, he still kept a 
National Security Council computer terminal at home, and North could 
communicate with him through its secret channels. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining this odd arrangement, North told Judge Harold H. Greene: "Mr. 
McFarlane had started the (Iran) initiative; he had been involved in it from 
the beginning, and it is my understanding that he stayed involved in it." 
</P>
<P>
The White House decided to allow the trip by North and McFarlane, who would try 
to negotiate the release of hostages. By the time the trip was approved it was 
no longer being considered as preparation for a visit by higher-level 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Although no high Administration official was aboard the plane, McFarlane was 
authorized to negotiate on behalf of the U.S. government. The May, 1986, trip, 
however, was a disaster. McFarlane failed to obtain the release of any 
hostages, and the flight itself inspired rumors that spread throughout the 
Middle East and eventually led to public disclosures about the Iran-Contra 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
Although North, in his testimony, noted that the original planners thought of 
the possibility of using the vice president in the negotiations, he did not 
elaborate and was not questioned further about it. President Bush has 
continually denied any involvement in the Iran-Contra affair. 
</P>
<P>
Beckler was so circuitous in his attempts to induce North to relieve Poindexter 
of responsibility in the scandal that his questioning seemed to trouble Greene 
and lose the attention of the jury. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Greene showed his patience. "I have a lifetime appointment," he said, 
"and, if necessary, I can listen to Col. North until my term runs out." 
</P>
<P>
Later, he snapped: "If it wasn't this kind of case with this much visibility, I 
would have struck half of your questions." He then warned Beckler that his 
patience could not hold indefinitely. True to his threat, he then cut the 
lawyer's questions off several times, pronouncing them irrelevant.

Almost half of Americans polled (49%) say that President Bush should get a new

President Dan Quayle should be retained, according to a new Gallup Poll. 
Thirty-one percent of the American public now feels that Quayle is qualified to 
serve as President, with 54% saying that he is unqualified and 15% unsure.

Several tornadoes struck Hesston, in south-central Kansas, killing a 6-year-old 
boy, injuring 13 other people and wrecking homes, authorities said. Hesston 
"took a direct hit and there is major damage," a Highway Patrol dispatcher in 
Wichita said. He said the town of about 3,000 people was left without 
electricity, with at least 40% of its buildings severely damaged and perhaps 
100 homes destroyed.

quick passage of a bill guaranteeing their civil rights. Those who could walk 
were handcuffed, and some were strapped into their wheelchairs by police. Those 
arrested were charged with two misdemeanors, unlawful entry and demonstrating

Knootka, one of Sea World's three adult killer whales, died Tuesday after a 
four-month battle with a rare fungous infection, Sea World officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears Knootka was overwhelmed with the infections," said Dr. Jim McBain, 
Sea World staff veterinarian. 
</P>
<P>
Knootka, who weighed 8,500 pounds, is the third killer whale to die at the 
private marine park in 18 months. In August, 1988, just three days after the 
birth of Baby Shamu, the baby's father, Orky, died of old age, park officials 
said. At about 30, Orky was the oldest killer whale in captivity at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in August, 1989, Baby Shamu's mother, 14-year-old Kandu, died in a freak 
injury caused when she attempted to dominate another female whale, Corky, 
during a performance. Since then, Corky has become a surrogate mother to Baby 
Shamu, also known as Orkid. 
</P>
<P>
Knootka was in her mid- to late-20s and Sea World officials blamed her age for 
much of her frailty.

An Amtrak passenger train crash that killed three people and injured dozens on 
a foggy day last December was caused by the driver of a speeding truck that 
smashed through warning gates and hit the train, investigators said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A report by an investigative task force concluded that the driver "was going 
too fast for the foggy conditions" at the crash site near Stockton, said 
California Highway Patrol spokesman Bob Whitmire. 
</P>
<P>
The truck driver was one of those killed. 
</P>
<P>
The findings contradict a statement by a motorist who was following the 
big-rig. The motorist said that warning equipment at the railroad crossing was 
not working, Whitmire said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, David Haskell, 47, was killed instantly as the cab of the big-rig 
shattered. The engineer and fireman, who were operating the train within the 
speed limit, were burned to death when flames engulfed the derailed engine, 
Whitmire said. 
</P>
<P>
The five-car train, carrying more than 140 people, was southbound from Oakland 
to Bakersfield when the crash occurred on Dec. 19.

The inside of the stadium is going to be as empty as the inside of a football. 
Tickets will be scalped for 50 cents. The Lakers will out-draw the Raiders. The 
Lazers will out-draw the Raiders. Attendance won't just be announced, it will 
be identified by name. "The Raiders would like to thank our fans for coming 
today -- both of them." 
</P>
<P>
The place will look like one of those New England college gymnasiums 
quarantined by an outbreak of measles. Some referee will penalize the Raider 
crowd five yards for not making enough noise. John Elway will be able to 
whisper his audibles. Each cheerleader will pick out one fan, and personally do 
a cheer: "Gimme an R -- come on, mister, gimme an R!" 
</P>
<P>
Until 1992, when Football's Fabulous Males officially move back to Oakland, 
they are going to be persona non grata in greater metropolitan Los Angeles. The 
exit ramps at Exposition and Martin Luther King on Sunday morning will be 
lonelier than a country two-lane blacktop. Those parking-lot people who have 
gouged you for years will pay you to park there now. 
</P>
<P>
There won't be enough fans in the stands to work up a decent wave, which might 
be the best aftermath of all of the Raiders' leaving. Marc Wilson can come back 
now -- there'll be nobody left to say boo. If crowd noise affects momentum, the 
Raiders had better pipe some canned noise through the loudspeakers, the way pro 
wrestling does on television. 
</P>
<P>
I can picture it now -- 15,000 people at the Raiders' 1990 home opener. Five 
thousand are fans of the visiting team. Five thousand come carrying bedsheets 
bearing stupid slogans that begin with the letters NBC, so they can be seen on 
TV. Four thousand, nine hundred ninety-nine have nothing better to do. And then 
there's that one guy with his "John 3:16" sign, who ought to go to church on 
Sunday and leave us alone. 
</P>
<P>
Lines at restrooms will be shorter than the lines outside the Hard Rock Cafe. 
Steve Beuerlein will interrupt a huddle to shout at some fan to turn down his 
radio. NBC, concerned about appearances, will place cardboard cutouts of fans 
throughout the Coliseum. Coaches in the press box will discard their 
walkie-talkies and just yell down to Art Shell. 
</P>
<P>
"Yo, Art! Art! Cornerback's too deep! Corner's too deep!" 
</P>
<P>
It'll be quieter than a public library. No, quieter than a Seattle Mariner 
game. Construction workers could erect luxury boxes during a Raider game now, 
not disturbing anybody. They ought to install parking spaces with private 
speaker boxes, like a drive-in movie. Just drive right up to the sideline and 
watch the game. 
</P>
<P>
When fans yell, "Down in front!" it'll be at a player. No nets will be 
necessary behind the goal posts. The security force will be reduced to four 
rent-a-cops and that guy who got slapped by Zsa Zsa Gabor. Postgame garbage 
detail will take about six minutes. How long does it take to pick up 18 empty 
cups and two Twinkie wrappers? 
</P>
<P>
Or, maybe we're wrong. Maybe we've got this thing backward. Maybe Raider 
telephones are ringing off the hook today with requests for season tickets. 
"Good morning! Thank you for calling the Los Ang . . . uh, the Raiders! All 
circuits are presently busy, so please hold. Your call will be answered in 
whatever order Mr. Davis receives it." 
</P>
<P>
Season tickets, get 'em while they're cold. You say you live in the San 
Fernando Valley and you don't care to make the 22-hour drive to Anaheim on 
California's fun, fun, fun freeways? Then come on down to the Coliseum, 
America's ghost park. One hundred thousand seats, no waiting. Bring the kids. 
Bring the neighbors' kids. Drag every kid out of every mall in the whole 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Sorry, every Ram home game is going to be sold out until the year 2001, but the 
Raiders? Hey, Good Seats R Us. It's our September Going-out-of-Business Sale! 
If you need a place to meet, go see Al! If you want a better seat, go see Al! 
</P>
<P>
Raider fans understood some of the risks of not buying tickets last season. 
They chose not to buy out the stadium, except for a Bronco game and maybe one 
other. They decided that if Al Davis was going, he was going no matter what 
they did. They decided it was up to the politicians and stadium big shots to 
save the franchise, not up to them. 
</P>
<P>
Well, I don't know. Maybe sellout crowds, week after week, would have swayed 
Al. He's big on loyalty, remember. He's sorrier than anybody that the Raiders 
weren't one of the powers of the NFL these last four seasons, but then again, 
they didn't exactly go down the tubes, the way the Dallas Cowboys did. 
</P>
<P>
When St. Louis lost the NFL Cardinals, there was an argument over who or what 
was responsible. The owner was upset that the team wasn't selling tickets to 
enough fans. The fans were upset that the owner expected them to buy tickets to 
an inferior product. The fans considered it emotional blackmail -- Give us your 
money or else. Give us something to watch, the fans said, and we'll watch it. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California's fans didn't chase away the Raiders, but they didn't 
exactly fall to their knees and beg them not to go. Well, it's Northern 
California's worry now. Be seeing some of you at the Coliseum next season. 
Don't bother wearing black.

GATHERS' SON'S RESULTS UNDISCLOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Marva Crump and her son Aaron went to the doctor on Tuesday to learn the 
results of tests Aaron underwent for a possible heart ailment. 
</P>
<P>
They returned with the information but declined to discuss the results on the 
advice of an attorney they contacted Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Crump is the 6-year-old son of Hank Gathers, the Loyola Marymount 
basketball star who died March 4 after collapsing during a West Coast 
Conference tournament game at Gersten Pavilion. Gathers had been found to have 
cardiac arrhythmia, an irregular heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
Since a story about Aaron being tested for a possible heart problem was 
published in The Times on Monday, the Crumps have retained an attorney who has 
ordered them not to talk about anything related to Gathers' death, including 
Aaron's possible heart condition. 
</P>
<P>
However, a source familiar with the situation said Aaron might undergo further 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
"I represent the interests of the minor child," said Adrian J. Moody, a 
Philadelphia attorney. "At this point we are investigating the situation, and 
there will be a statement at a later date." 
</P>
<P>
Moody said he did not know if a suit will be filed. He also said he has not 
contacted Bruce Fagel, a Beverly Hills attorney who is representing the Gathers 
family. 
</P>
<P>
Fagel announced Friday at a news conference that a suit would be filed this 
week. But Tuesday his legal administrator, Trudy Miller, said they would not 
file for about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said they want to give the Gathers family time to recover from the 
trauma and wait until Loyola's basketball team ends its season. She also said 
Fagel has not finished his investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Fagel held a news conference last Friday to respond to a story in The Times 
that quoted Loyola President Father James N. Loughran as saying he was 
satisfied with the school's handling of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
However, Fagel, who also is an emergency room physician, discussed at length 
whom he is considering naming as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lucille Gathers, Hank Gathers' mother, remains in stable condition 
here at Hahnemann University Hospital. She checked into the hospital early 
Saturday morning complaining of chest pains, according to Phyllis Fisher, a 
hospital spokesperson. 
</P>
<P>
She was permitted by doctors to leave the hospital to attend her son's funeral 
Monday. But about two hours into the service, she left the church and returned 
to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Elliott Almond contributed to this story from Los Angeles.

BASEBALL: BUSH CALLS FOR SETTLEMENT, STEINBRENNER AND MCMULLEN RIP UNION, BUT 
FEHR AND O'CONNOR DON'T MEET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Day 27 of the baseball owners spring training lockout was not without rhetoric, 
but there were no collective bargaining meetings Tuesday and none is scheduled 
today. 
</P>
<P>
As John McMullen, owner of the Houston Astros, and George Steinbrenner, owner 
of the New York Yankees, were criticizing the players and their union Tuesday, 
the only communication between Charles O'Connor, general counsel of the owners' 
Player Relations Committee, and Don Fehr, executive director of the Major 
League Players Assn., was an exchange of courtesy calls. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be more discouraged if we weren't talking at all, but there is still no 
basis for believing a meeting would lead to a solution (on the issue of 
arbitration eligibility)," O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
He and Fehr will be in the same place at the same time this morning, when 
arbitrator George Nicolau conducts a hearing at the union's New York offices. 
He will consider a motion filed by Fehr Monday asking Nicolau to order the 
owners to put $52 million of their $170 million lockout fund in an escrow 
account as a down payment on collusion damages. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor said he would oppose the motion but declined to give reasons. 
</P>
<P>
In developments Tuesday: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Commissioner Fay Vincent met with American League President Bobby Brown and 
National League President Bill White to discuss cancellation of the opening set 
of regular-season games, but there will be no announcement before Friday, 
according to Brown. 
</P>
<P>
The American League president said there was a reluctance to make a premature 
announcement if a bargaining settlement was still possible before Friday. He 
said that if more than two or three games are canceled, they will not be made 
up, adding that the primary concern is to see that every team plays the same 
number of games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In a conference call between PRC members it was decided that minor league 
teams will be allowed to play exhibition games in Florida and Arizona stadiums, 
O'Connor said, but they are not to be billed as replacement or major league 
games, and some or all receipts, if an admission is charged, should go to 
charity. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, both President Bush and his son, George W. Bush Jr., an owner of the 
Texas Rangers, entered the lockout debate Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The President urged negotiators to resolve the stalemate so that he could 
attend a season opener somewhere, while his son said that the union should put 
the owners' offer of a $4-million bonus pool for players with between two and 
three years of service to a vote of the players, which would prove if there's 
"disgruntlement or division" among the members. 
</P>
<P>
Fehr responded by saying that it was "unbecoming" for an owner who has not 
attended one negotiating session and isn't allowed on the negotiating team by 
fellow owners to comment on things of which he has no knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
There was more from Steinbrenner and McMullen. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankee owner warned players that if they continue to reject a settlement 
they could find themselves out of jobs, as some air traffic controllers and 
National Football League players did. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner's comments ignored the fact that the controllers and football 
players went on strike (the controllers illegally), while baseball's 
confrontation stems, in large measure, from a lockout by the owners. 
</P>
<P>
McMullen told the Houston Chronicle that the players have refused to accept an 
"unconditional surrender" by the owners because they are incapable of making a 
deal, that they shouldn't be allowed in the negotiations because, "when they 
have an argument with their wives, they've got to call their agent to settle 
it." 
</P>
<P>
He accused players and union officials of outrageous and insulting treatment of 
a commissioner who has been willing to go "the whole route," and said the 
current impasse may wipe out the season. 
</P>
<P>
Of the comments, O'Connor said that Vincent, indeed, has been exhausted by the 
process but did not believe he has been insulted, although a recent comment by 
Fehr associate Gene Orza, relating to gangsterism among the owners, is known to 
have raised management's ire. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not endorse comments from anybody that can be regarded as personal or 
demeaning," O'Connor said in regard to McMullen's statements. "On the other 
hand, recognize that in the last four or five days a ranking official of the 
union has referred to the owners as a bunch of gangsters. 
</P>
<P>
"Labor negotiations is like physics. An action begets a reaction. And John 
McMullen is John McMullen. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't ask me or the PRC to endorse everything John says, but in fairness don't 
take John's comments and put them in a vacuum."

CS LONG BEACH'S DIFFICULT JOURNEY BEGINS WITH CAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Unhappy her team was seeded sixth in the NCAA West Regional, Coach Joan 
Bonvicini of the Cal State Long Beach women's basketball team said, "You don't 
get mad, you get even." 
</P>
<P>
The 14th-ranked 49ers will get that chance tonight at 7:30 in a first-round 
game against California. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to play some patsies. . . . What good is it to play a (tough 
regular-season) schedule if it doesn't mean anything at the end?" Bonvicini 
asked after learning Long Beach (24-8) had been placed in the West Regional 
with second-ranked Stanford and fifth-ranked Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
If the 49ers beat Cal (17-11) tonight, they travel to Nacogdoches, Tex., for a 
game against No. 6-ranked Stephen F. Austin (27-2). 
</P>
<P>
Stephen F. Austin is one of the top four seeded teams in the regional. Also 
getting first-round byes were Stanford (27-1), Georgia (25-4) and Nevada Las 
Vegas (28-2). 
</P>
<P>
Cal, seeded 11th in the West, finished 9-9 in the Pacific 10 Conference and is 
making its first NCAA tournament appearance. The Bears will be relying on 
junior Teresa Palmisano, who is averaging 13 points and seven rebounds a game, 
and junior guard Laura Baker, averaging 11.8 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach's only senior, Angelique Lee, has averaged 17 points and 13.9 
rebounds in her last 10 games. PETE THOMAS

LSU'S JACKSON REPEATS AS AN ALL-AMERICAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sophomore Chris Jackson of Louisiana State was named to the Associated Press 
All-America college basketball team for the second consecutive year Tuesday, 
joining seniors Lionel Simmons of La Salle, Gary Payton of Oregon State and 
Derrick Coleman of Syracuse and junior Larry Johnson of Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who last year became only the second freshman All-American, is the 
52nd player to repeat in the 42 years the AP team has been selected. 
</P>
<P>
Wayman Tisdale of Oklahoma, who in 1983 was the first freshman All-American, 
went on to be a three-time selection before leaving the Sooners after his 
junior season. 
</P>
<P>
The voting was done by the same national panel of sports writers and 
broadcasters that selects the weekly top 25. 
</P>
<P>
The second team: sophomore Alonzo Mourning of Georgetown, juniors Dennis Scott 
of Georgia Tech and Doug Smith of Missouri and seniors Rumeal Robinson of 
Michigan and Bo Kimble of Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
The late Hank Gathers of Loyola Marymount was selected to the third team, along 
with seniors Steve Scheffler of Purdue and Kendall Gill of Illinois, junior 
Steve Smith of Michigan State, and freshman Kenny Anderson of Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons, Mourning and Gathers were named to the third team a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, UNLV's first All-American, sees another first on the horizon for the 
Runnin' Rebels as they open play as the top-seeded team in the NCAA West 
regional -- their first national title. 
</P>
<P>
"It's there for us. We believe we can win the whole thing," said Johnson. "I 
don't think we'll go in and dominate, but I think our chances are as good as 
any other team." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's second-ranked Rebels (29-5), coming off a Big West tournament 
performance that saw them win by an average of 22 points a game, face Arkansas 
Little Rock (20-9) in Salt Lake City Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina and Southwest Missouri State have never met on the basketball 
court, but the Bears' Charlie Spoonhour feels as if he's coached against Dean 
Smith before. 
</P>
<P>
"We've played Larry Brown's Kansas team, Roy Williams' Kansas team and we've 
played Eddie Fogler at Wichita State," Spoonhour said. "They all learned under 
one of the greatest coaches in the history of the game and incorporated some of 
(Smith's) teachings into their programs." 
</P>
<P>
Brown played for Smith at North Carolina, and Williams and Fogler were 
assistants to Smith before becoming head coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Spoonhour will match wits with Smith, who has 686 career victories, when the 
Bears (22-6) and Tar Heels (19-12) play Thursday in Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Spoonhour, hired by Southwest Missouri in 1983, has a 152-60 record. 
</P>
<P>
Nadav Henefeld, a former Israeli soldier and Big East rookie of the year at 
Connecticut, will have only two more years of college eligibility left after 
this season, Coach Jim Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
Henefeld, 21, has been listed as a freshman, but school officials expected he 
would be allowed to play only for three seasons because of his age and 
participation on the Israeli national team. 
</P>
<P>
Calhoun said he has received a final ruling from the NCAA on Henefeld's status. 
</P>
<P>
After an 11-year absence, the Connecticut Huskies are returning to the NCAA 
tournament in style -- riding the crest of a Big East championship, ranked No. 
3 in the nation, seeded first in the East and playing before home-state fans. 
The Boston University Terriers, who play the Huskies Thursday at the Hartford 
Civic Center, say that doesn't bother them a bit. 
</P>
<P>
"I've played at the Carrier Dome, Rupp Arena and the gym that's called the 
'Thunder Dome' at Santa Barbara," said BU guard Steve Key. "We've played in 
front of hostile crowds before." 
</P>
<P>
It's the other stuff that worries Key -- the Huskies' trapping defense, which 
generated a nation-leading 436 steals this season; their depth and offensive 
balance, which seems to produce a new scoring star each game; and Connecticut's 
team chemistry, which helped the Huskies run up a 28-5 record and energize a 
state full of success-starved basketball fans. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to play an almost perfect game to beat such a quality team," Key said. 
</P>
<P>
Boston, along with Murray State and Towson State, are the longest shots in the 
field. All three are listed at 5,000 to 1 to win it all. 
</P>
<P>
The University of Dayton's 10-game winning streak and spot in the NCAA 
tournament has been fueled in part by the performance of senior guard Negele 
Knight, who has been averaging nearly 30 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
After the first 20 games, Knight was averaging 19.8 points and 5.95 assists. 
But during the 10-game winning streak, he has been pumping in an average of 
29.3 points and making 7.9 assists. 
</P>
<P>
The Flyers (21-9) face Illinois (21-7) Thursday night at Austin. 
</P>
<P>
It will be Dayton's first appearance in the NCAA tournament since 1985, when 
the Flyers lost a two-point, first-round decision to eventual champion 
Villanova. 
</P>
<P>
Senior forward Anthony Corbitt said he talked with Knight after the Flyers lost 
three consecutive games at Notre Dame, Xavier and Loyola of Chicago and were 
left with an 11-9 record. 
</P>
<P>
"We were going nowhere fast," Corbitt said. "We weren't playing with any 
intensity."

Bill Reynolds stood in the tunnel of Kemper Arena Tuesday night fretting over 
the physical play going on down on the court. 
</P>
<P>
"These Midwest teams are very physical, and the officials seem to be letting 
them play," the Southern California College coach said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're more of a finesse team. We're going to have to take it up a notch to be 
competitive." 
</P>

A couple of hours later, the Vanguards (26-8) had elevated their level of play 
several notches in a 102-82 victory over Washburn University of Topeka, Kan., 
in the first round of the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics men's 
basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Washburn (20-12) won this tournament in 1987 and although the Ichabods were 
unseeded, they are moving up to NCAA Division II next year, and nine of their 
previous 11 losses this season were against Division-II schools. 
</P>
<P>
The 15th-seeded Vanguards, who meet second-seeded Wisconsin Eau Claire Thursday 
in the second round, shot 63% from the field in the second half to turn a 44-44 
halftime tie into a rout. Forward Terry Scruggs made 12 of 17 shots from the 
field -- including five of seven three-pointers -- to lead SCC with 32 points. 
</P>
<P>
"Any game could be my last," said Scruggs, a senior, "and I'm not ready to quit 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
The difference in the game came in two spurts. The Southern California 
outscored Washburn, 14-2, early in the first half to turn a 7-2 deficit into a 
16-9 lead. Five minutes into the second half with the scored tied, 55-55, the 
Vanguards went on a 20-2 run. 
</P>
<P>
Washburn Coach Bob Chipman said he felt the turning point came with 14:48 to 
play when 6-foot-7 Ichabod center Jeff Markray, who finished with 30 points and 
11 rebounds, picked up his fourth foul.

Evander Holyfield, the No. 1 heavyweight contender, is asking for a restraining 
order that would prevent heavyweight champion Buster Douglas and boxing 
promoter Don King from interfering with scheduled purse bids for a 
Douglas-Holyfield title bout. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing is scheduled for today in New Jersey Superior Court on Holyfield's

NFL MEETINGS; 
</P>
<P>
OWNERS CHANGE RULES IN HOPE OF SHORTENING GAMES TO THREE HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The NFL owners, still following where Commissioner Paul Tagliabue leads, made a 
new effort Tuesday to shorten the overall time period of their 60-minute game. 
</P>
<P>
This is one of the new commissioner's priorities. An average NFL game last 
season ran 3 hours 11 minutes, which was, in his view, much too long. 
</P>
<P>
"(The NFL) needs a three-hour game," Tagliabue said. "And the action we took 
today will move us in that direction." 
</P>
<P>
The action: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The clubs voted to pare NFL halftimes from 15 minutes to 12. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And they voted to save another five or six minutes by getting the game 
clock going sooner in selected situations. 
</P>
<P>
A football clock doesn't run continuously. It is stopped when, for instance, 
the ball goes out of bounds, or when a penalty is called, or after kickoff 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
And for years in NFL games, it hasn't been restarted until the center snapped 
the ball to the quarterback for the next play. 
</P>
<P>
To save time this season, the game clock will be restarted when the referee 
gives his familiar ready signal -- instead of on the snap -- on three kinds of 
occasions: after a player goes out of bounds, after a declined penalty and 
after kickoff returns. 
</P>
<P>
The only exceptions, the NFL decided late Tuesday, will come in the final two 
minutes of the first half and the final five minutes of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
In another change, the 30-second clock will become a 25-second clock this 
season, matching the time allowed for college teams to put the ball in play. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue appointed a new realignment-expansion committee to go to work on one 
of the league's most difficult problems. 
</P>
<P>
It is a committee of the whole -- consisting of the chairmen of the league's 
top committees -- plus Tagliabue, who said he will be the chairman of the 
chairmen. 
</P>
<P>
"Traditionally, the NFL has expanded two cities at a time," Tagliabue said. "I 
would expect that we'll add two teams within two years or so, giving us 15 
teams in each of two conferences, with five teams in each division." 
</P>
<P>
Realignment, however, will not come until at least 1994, and it hasn't happened 
since 1969, when Pete Rozelle settled the infighting with a blind lottery.

RAIDERS SET DEADLINE OF MAY 4 FOR REFUNDS ON SEASON TICKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Raider season-ticket holders have until May 4 to request in writing a refund on 
their deposits for the 1990 season, a staff member in the club's ticket office 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Those who plan to renew their season tickets must send in a 25% deposit by 
March 23 and full payment must be received by April 27 to guarantee renewal of 
seating. 
</P>
<P>
According to the season-ticket form, a full refund must be requested, in 
writing, no later than seven days after the deadline for final payment. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders said they had received few phone calls requesting information about 
refunds for season tickets in the wake of owner Al Davis' announcement that he 
intends to return the team to Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, we've been getting calls from the Bay Area wondering about buying 
season tickets," said Peter Eiges of the ticket office. "We have to tell them 
that until everything is finalized, we don't have a plan for that. As Mr. Davis 
said, we are waiting for the whole process to take place." 
</P>
<P>
And the Los Angeles-area fans who call? 
</P>
<P>
"We tell them that our lease with the Coliseum runs two more years and we 
expect to be playing our games here the next two years." 
</P>
<P>
And if the Coliseum Commission releases Davis from the lease? 
</P>
<P>
"We can only go by what we know," Eiges said. "We plan to play here two more 
years." JIM COLONNA

JAMES FLANIGAN: WAY U.S. COUNTS JOBLESS MAY BE OUTDATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A top U.S. economic official, speaking privately at a recent luncheon, was 
worried by an eerie silence. Amid evidence that the U.S. economy is slowing, 
unemployment has remained steady for almost a year, said the official. "That 
unemployment rate may take a leap upward one of these months and give us all a 
shock." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the latest figures released last Friday belied the official's fears. 
Unemployment remained at 6.6 million, 5.3% of the labor force, while hiring 
rose dramatically -- 372,000 new jobs created in February to bring total 
employment to 118 million. 
</P>
<P>
True, unemployment figures can be deceptive; economists call them lagging 
indicators. "One of the last things companies do when the economy turns down is 
get rid of employees," says economist Pierre Rinfret, of Rinfret Associates. In 
1981 unemployment figures remained fairly low even as the economy slid into 
recession. But then they leaped to 9.5% in 1982 and stayed at that high level 
through 1983 despite economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Today there may be impending unemployment in industries such as 
aerospace-defense. But nothing is happening yet, says Patricia Straugh of Data 
Resources Inc., the economic forecasting firm. "Defense companies aren't laying 
off because they're working on long-term contracts, and waiting for Congress to 
decide which weapons programs to cut." Those congressional decisions could come 
in a month or two, she explains. "But even after that, layoffs may not be 
severe. The companies are trying to keep their employees together and look 
around for other work." 
</P>
<P>
So what's the story -- will there be a sharp rise in joblessness this year? 
</P>
<P>
Probably not. The truth is, the national unemployment figure is out of date 
because the economy has changed so much in the last decade or so -- for reasons 
both positive and negative. 
</P>
<P>
In the positive sense, "we don't have a national economy anymore," suggests 
Daniel Mitchell, head of the Institute of Industrial Relations at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Regional differences took over in the 1980s, when the Northeast prospered while 
the Southwest and Midwest suffered. Today, to some extent, the wheel has 
turned. The Northeast is slowing, and New Englanders are worried -- even though 
the region's overall unemployment is only 5%. 
</P>
<P>
In Texas, meanwhile, the unemployment rate has gone down to 6%, yet everybody 
is positive because things are turning up after a devastating decade. And the 
Midwest, an area that was battered by competition from imports for much of the 
1980s, is now doing a lot better taking advantage of export markets for 
machinery and for grain. 
</P>
<P>
But the Midwest is not doing well because big companies are firing their 
furnaces. "It's no longer an economy of big companies, big unions and 
government wage guidelines," says UCLA's Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
Instead the pattern is one of diverse, smaller firms -- even smaller towns. 
David Birch, the industrial consultant who noted almost a decade ago that big 
companies were eliminating jobs and smaller firms creating them, is now looking 
at "boom neighborhoods" -- local areas of intense economic activity, whether in 
the heart of major cities such as Los Angeles and New York or in their suburbs. 
In Melville, on New York's Long Island, for example, a company of four 
full-time employees named Qosina makes medical and cosmetic packages for 
customers in England, Germany and the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
But regional differences explain only one aspect of the new economy, says Kevin 
Murphy, of the University of Chicago School of Business. Education has become 
the big divider, with educated people enjoying abundant opportunities and high 
school dropouts falling out of the active labor force altogether. 
</P>
<P>
The unemployment and employment figures count only those in the active work 
force -- those who are working or looking for work. Where 66.8% of adult 
Americans are in that work force, participation by the less educated poor is 
often below 50%. 
</P>
<P>
The upshot is the unemployment figures don't tell the full story. Some 
unemployed people keep looking but have little prospect of finding jobs in 
today's economy because they lack the skills. Others have given up looking. 
</P>
<P>
"So the unemployment figure remains steady because many of those who are 
counted cannot work, and many others are no longer counted," says Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
The point, of course, is that to see what's really happening one must look 
beyond the figures. In that respect, the short-term outlook is a tossup. Yes, 
unemployment could rise if profits decline. Yet on the other hand, new job 
figures could continue to look dramatic -- swelled by auto workers returning 
from layoff and the government hiring 400,000 temporaries to take the national 
census in April. 
</P>
<P>
But long term, over the decade of the '90s, there's no doubt: The U.S. will 
have a labor-short economy, with fewer than 20 million new workers entering the 
labor force, compared to almost 26 million in the last 10 years. That will mean 
opportunity and high pay for skilled people, as is already evident in 
$28,000-a-year starting pay for accountants and $35,500 beginning salary for 
nurses in big-city hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Lest we forget, however, there is also a challenge -- to bring the 6.6 million 
and more unemployed into full participation in the U.S. economy through 
education and job-training. A labor-short nation cannot afford to do less, on 
strict economic grounds -- not to mention those of social justice.

WHAT EMBARGO'S END MEANS FOR MANAGUA; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE: THE LIFTING OF SANCTIONS IS EXPECTED TO GIVE NICARAGUA'S ECONOMY A 
BOOST. BUT ANALYSTS SAY THE BENEFITS COULD TAKE AWHILE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BOUDREAUX and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sandinista officials and private businessmen welcomed the lifting of the U.S. 
trade embargo Tuesday as a major step toward reviving Nicaragua's war-battered 
economy but warned that few benefits will come immediately. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, companies are already eyeing Nicaragua's primarily 
agricultural economy as a business opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
The end of nearly five years of U.S. economic sanctions, announced by President 
Bush in Washington, is likely to multiply commercial flights between Managua 
and U.S. cities, to double the price Nicaragua receives for its sugar, to make 
such vital imports as medicine and farm machinery cheaper for Nicaraguans and 
to bring U.S. investment in a post-revolutionary economy. 
</P>
<P>
But businessmen cautioned that few, if any, of these changes will come before 
President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro takes power from the Sandinista 
government April 25 and starts using a promised U.S. aid package to reopen 
commercial credit lines shut down by the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
"This announcement tells the world that Nicaragua has changed and can do 
business with the United States again," said Gilberto Cuadra, president of the 
Superior Council of Private Enterprise and a leading adviser to Chamorro. "But 
for now, it is more symbolic than real. It won't mean anything until we can 
produce and trade on a larger scale." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Commerce Department official Timothy Ashby said that "it's still very 
early in the game" to tell how quickly trade with Nicaragua will rebound. 
</P>
<P>
But rumors about the Bush Administration's plans have created "quite a bit of 
interest already," said Ashby, director of the International Trade 
Administration's Office of Mexico and the Caribbean Basin, which is part of the 
Commerce Department. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a lot of inquiries from potential business people," he said. "So I 
think we'll see a lot of return from exile (of Nicaraguan business people) and 
the return of a lot of flight capital" that left the country under Sandinista 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
However, even a reinvigorated Nicaragua of the future is liable to be just a 
small piece of the U.S. trade picture. 
</P>
<P>
"It was peanuts before, and it will be peanuts after," said a spokesman for the 
U.S. Trade Representative's Office. 
</P>
<P>
The embargo was imposed May 1, 1985, in the midst of the U.S.-backed Contra 
war, as part of the Reagan Administration's campaign to dislodge the 
Sandinistas from power. It barred commerce between the two countries, except 
for donated medicine and other items considered humanitarian, and blocked loans 
to Nicaragua from U.S.-based lending agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Because Nicaraguans found ways to get around the embargo, its impact has been 
debatable. But it contributed in part to the economic decline that prompted 
voters last month to turn the Sandinista revolutionaries out of office and 
elect a pro-American coalition that favors private enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
In lifting the embargo and asking Congress for $300 million in emergency cash 
for Nicaragua, Bush met requests by Chamorro's economic advisers for a key 
element of their recovery program, while allowing the Sandinistas to leave 
office with the country on better terms with Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the sanctions an affront to all his countrymen, Nicaraguan Vice 
President Sergio Ramirez welcomed Bush's decision as "an act of justice that 
has taken too long." 
</P>
<P>
He said it "responds to the initiatives this (Sandinista) government has taken" 
in holding free elections and pledging to turn over power. 
</P>
<P>
"We are interested in the new government's having resources to help it overcome 
the profound economic crisis that this war has created," Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
In Santiago, Chile, where he attended the inauguration of President Patricio 
Aylwin over the weekend, President Daniel Ortega said: 
</P>
<P>
"I celebrate this as a victory of the Nicaraguan people, who have suffered so 
much. They deserve this and more. Although it's little, considering Nicaragua's 
economic circumstances, it shows a willingness to help." 
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua's Foreign Ministry invited the Bush Administration to send an 
economic delegation here to find ways to make its promised aid available "as 
soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
The embargo made Nicaragua's agriculture-based economy more dependent on Cuba, 
the Soviet Union and their East Bloc allies, while diverting business once 
conducted by U.S. companies to Canada, Brazil, Japan and other countries. In 
1984, the United States was Nicaragua's largest trading partner, accounting for 
17% of its foreign commerce. 
</P>
<P>
That year, Nicaragua exported $58 million in goods to the United States, most 
of it such agricultural products as bananas, beef, shrimp, coffee and sugar. 
That total was down from nearly $214 million in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Nicaragua bought nearly $110 million worth of chemicals, paper 
products, food and other products from the United States, down from about $247 
million in 1980, according to the Commerce Department. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Sandinista officials calculated the cost of the embargo up to that 
point at $325 million. 
</P>
<P>
Other economists say the impact has been more modest. Many American spare parts 
can be bought from other Western countries, and those available only in the 
United States are imported through companies in Panama and elsewhere. At 
hard-currency stores in most Nicaraguan cities, shelves are stocked with 
Campbell's soup, Kleenex, Oreo cookies and other U.S. products that the embargo 
was meant to stop. 
</P>
<P>
But such "triangulation" schemes have inflated the prices of U.S. products 
here. 
</P>
<P>
The end of the embargo will make U.S. consumer goods and medicines cheaper. And 
it will rescue businesses unable to replace worn-out heavy equipment made in 
the United States, such as industrial coffee dryers and milk boilers. Today, 
Nicaragua exports much of its coffee unprocessed, and the milk industry is 
collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua will become eligible again for a quota of the U.S. sugar market, 
which now pays double the price of the country's current European buyers. 
</P>
<P>
"Sugar is one export that can make an immediate leap," an official at the 
Central Bank said. 
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua can be expected to buy all sorts of U.S. merchandise, Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology economist Lance Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's not going to be any big trade bonanza for the United States," said 
Taylor, who did a survey of the Nicaraguan economy last year. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Alejandro Arguello, Nicaragua's director of civil aviation, said Tuesday 
that Aeronica, the state airline, will soon apply for landing rights in Miami, 
where it flew four days a week until the embargo. At present, only Lacsa, a 
Costa Rican carrier, makes direct flights from Managua to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. carriers will be welcome to land again at Managua's Augusto Cesar Sandino 
airport, Arguello added. 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating an end to the embargo, a team from the Federal Aviation 
Administration inspected the airport's runways and pronounced them fit, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Continental and Pan Am, two big carriers that serve other Central American 
countries from which passengers can take connecting flights to Managua, are 
watching the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a little soon for us to focus on it," a Continental spokesman said 
Tuesday. "As of Thursday, Continental will have more flights to Central 
American destinations than any U.S. carrier, but Managua doesn't happen to be 
one of them." 
</P>
<P>
More flights could mean tourists for Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a wonderful travel destination" that was once very popular, said Pat 
Petit-Clerc, who develops new tours for Travcoa, a wholesale operator of luxury 
tours, based in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll probably skip it for 1991 and take a good look at it in 1992," 
said Petit-Clerc, noting that the company already offers several other Central 
American tours. "It's like the Middle East: If you wait for it to settle down 
completely, you'll never go." 
</P>
<P>
By reopening Nicaraguan seaports to U.S. carriers, the end of sanctions could 
open California markets to Nicaraguan bananas, beef, rum and coffee now sold in 
Europe. Corinto, Nicaragua's main Pacific port, is the banana port closest to 
the U.S. West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Ramiro Gurdian, a former banana grower in that region, said several 
multinational companies have expressed interest in buying out state-owned 
plantations and shipping bananas to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The promise of new business opportunities has drawn many Nicaraguan businessmen 
home from exile since Chamorro's Feb. 25 election. One of those arriving 
Tuesday was Eduardo del Carmen, a clothing manufacturer and retailer who left 
for Miami 10 years ago after the Sandinistas limited his supply of dollars to 
buy cloth from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"That's good news," he said of the end of trade sanctions. "As long as there's 
going to be peace and reconciliation in Nicaragua, we can start rebuilding. 
Nicaraguans are good workers. I'm very optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
Businessmen who struggled to survive the embargo inside Nicaragua were also 
relieved. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we can produce enough to supply all of Central America," said Edgar 
Acosta, whose company will resume chemical imports from the United States to 
make brake fluid and engine coolants. His business shrank from 22 to 14 workers 
after turning to more expensive chemicals from Europe in 1985 and losing its 
export markets. 
</P>
<P>
Until Nicaragua comes to terms with American creditors, however, commerce is 
expected to be limited to what can be bought with its dwindling supply of 
dollars. The promised U.S. aid package will help Nicaragua pay its bank debts 
and will make the country eligible for new lending by the World Bank and 
Inter-American Development Bank for roads and other public works. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no financial relations to make transactions with the United States 
now," Nicaraguan economist Mario Arana said. "The benefits (of Bush's action) 
will be felt once the new government takes over and these relations are 
normalized. The recovery will begin slowly and not be felt until the middle of 
the year." 
</P>

Brazil Closes Banks for Rest of Week: Brazil's Central Bank, the equivalent of 
the U.S. Federal Reserve, closed the nation's banks for the remainder of the 
week in anticipation of a series of emergency economic measures to be announced 
by President-elect Fernando Collor de Mello. Central Bank spokesman Pedro 
Kleinberg said the three-day bank holiday was ordered at the request of Zelia 
Cardoso de Mello, the nation's new economic minister, who is to take office 
with the new president on Thursday. The move took many locals and economists by 
surprise because only a day earlier Cardoso de Mello had said, "A bank holiday 
is absolutely not necessary."

A roundup of business developments spotted by other publications. 
</P>
<P>
Clothing Sales: The men's retail industry seems to be showing signs of 
rejuvenation after a two-year slump from a worldwide increase in wool prices 
that pushed the cost of some suits up $100. Since wool prices have stabilized, 
sales are improving. Two Chicago retailers, Hartmarx Specialty Stores and 
Baskin Clothing Co., report rising sales, greater profits and capital for 
expansion. And with some department stores reducing their commitment to 
low-profit menswear, specialty retailers are positioned to benefit. Chicago 
Tribune 
</P>
<P>
Food and Drink: ConAgra, the Nebraska-based food processing company, expects 
its new Healthy Choice line of frozen dinners and entrees to bring in more than 
$100 million in the 12 months ending in August. Fighting for precious freezer 
space with the likes of Right Course by Stouffer (a subsidiary of Nestle), 
Healthy Choice may have an edge, because Right Course has not sold as well as 
expected. Meanwhile, in the beer market Anheuser-Busch's Bud Dry, being tested 
in Texas, Oregon, Colorado and Washington, has captured an effervescent 2% 
market share. Allowing for decreased sales of other Anheuser-Busch products, 
the new beer is increasing the total market share by about 1%. The national 
rollout is expected this year. Chicago Tribune 
</P>
<P>
Hot Restaurants: Chili's Inc. of Dallas is cooking right along, with 180 
restaurants across the country and 425 outlets scheduled for construction over 
six years. Chili's saturation point is estimated at 400 outlets, because no 
other full-service chain has succeeded with more. To diversify, Chili's 
recently bought two small chains: Grady's Goodtimes of Knoxville, Tenn., and 
San Antonio's Macaroni Grill. Grady's will be renamed the Regas Grill and 
expand to about 150 units. The company will open just a few more Macaroni 
Grills. St. Petersburg Times, Dallas Morning News, Dallas Business Journal 
</P>
<P>
Showdown: Boise, Ida., is becoming a test market for discounters, as Target 
moves in to take on Fred Meyer, Shopko and K mart. Target's recent opening 
yielded good business and positive comments from customers, but to survive it 
must quickly claim its niche as a higher-quality, brand-name merchandiser. Fred 
Meyer will continue to woo customers with a reputation for service and 
selection; Shopko has targeted the low-end customer. Industry watchers caution 
that the sheer number of discounters will trigger price wars and that K mart's 
older stores will probably lose business. Discount Merchandiser

FORD AEROSPACE WINS DEFENSE SYSTEM CONTRACT; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: THE INITIAL ORDER, VALUED AT $21.4 MILLION, COULD GENERATE MUCH MORE 
IN SALES AND ATTRACT POTENTIAL BUYERS TO THE FIRM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Ford Aerospace Corp. said Tuesday that it has received its first production 
order for a new missile guidance system, a contract that could set the stage 
for hundreds of millions of dollars in sales through the 1990s and make the 
firm more attractive to potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The initial order for the so-called low-cost seeker portion of the Navy's 
high-speed anti-radiation missile (HARM) is valued at $21.4 million and calls 
for the manufacture of 100 of the guidance system units. The missile became 
operational in 1984, but the new guidance system has just been developed by 
Ford Aerospace. 
</P>
<P>
If the Navy continues to build the HARM at the current rate of roughly 1,500 
per year, Ford could gain substantially larger contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Ford Motor Co. announced earlier this year that it wants to sell its aerospace 
operation, and the HARM contract should make the subsidiary more attractive, 
analysts said. It will be a particularly welcome boost for the subsidiary's 
Newport Beach Aeronutronic division, which builds the seeker but is considered 
one of the more vulnerable parts of the far-flung Ford Aerospace operation. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very positive development," said C. E. Grubbs, a former Ford 
Aerospace manager and now a defense consultant in Newport Beach. "It lends a 
couple of years of stability and is good for morale at Aeronutronic. It 
definitely increases the salability of the company." 
</P>
<P>
An initial round of bids for Ford Aerospace was received at the beginning of 
March, but the company has not disclosed who submitted bids or whether the 
offers were for the entire subsidiary or only for individual divisions. Ford 
has said that it wants to sell the company, which analysts value at $500 
million to $800 million, in one piece, but many experts believe that it will be 
forced to sell it piecemeal. 
</P>
<P>
The HARM missile destroys radar and anti-aircraft systems by homing in on the 
radio frequencies they emit. The missile is built by Texas Instruments, but the 
seeker portion of the system has accounted for about half the purchase price, 
which stands at about $200,000 per missile. 
</P>
<P>
Ford Aerospace won a competition in 1988 to develop a lower-cost version of the 
HARM seeker that would also perform better against improved enemy radar 
systems, and the firm received $13.7 million to develop the technology and 
build pre-production units. The Navy's decision to go ahead with production 
means that 100 of the 1,604 HARM missiles to be built in 1990 will have the 
Ford seeker. The remainder will use existing Texas Instruments components. 
</P>
<P>
Curt James of Texas Instruments' weapons systems marketing group said the 1991 
defense budget, which has not yet been approved by Congress, calls for 1,440 
HARM missiles, of which 240 would use the Ford seeker. Texas Instruments is 
also developing its own version of a new seeker, James added, though it is not 
yet in production. 
</P>
<P>
James said there would eventually be a competition between Texas Instruments 
and Ford Aerospace for the seeker business. Ford spokeswoman Susan Pearce said 
the company may even bid against Texas Instruments to try to become the prime 
contractor for the HARM. 
</P>
<P>
But James and Pearce noted that the number of the Ford seekers ultimately 
ordered is heavily dependent on the Pentagon budget. The number of HARM 
missiles purchased by the Navy already has fallen from 2,400 a year several 
years ago to the 1,440 projected for 1991, and no one is willing to rule out 
further cuts. Navy officials could not be reached for comment.

CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT AT 5-YEAR LOW IN '89

The government said Tuesday that the deficit in the broadest measure of U.S. 
trade sank to a five-year low last year, but the $105.9-billion imbalance still 
pushed the country deeper into the hole as the world's largest debtor nation. 
</P>
<P>
America's current account balance narrowed by 16% from a $126.6-billion deficit 
in 1988, reflecting growth in exports, higher overseas earnings of American 
businesses and increased spending by visiting foreign tourists, according to 
the Commerce Department. 
</P>
<P>
The year ended on a positive note as the October-December trade deficit 
declined 10.2% from its third-quarter level to $20.57 billion. It was the 
smallest quarterly imbalance in almost six years. 
</P>
<P>
But private economists were unimpressed, contending that even with the 
improvement, the current account deficit remained above $100 billion for the 
sixth consecutive year as the United States plunged further into hock to the 
rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
The current account, also known as the balance of payments, is the most closely 
watched trade statistic because it measures not only trade in merchandise but 
also trade in services and investments. It reflects the amount of money the 
United States must borrow annually from foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
America began the 1980s as the world's largest creditor nation. It ran 
surpluses in its current account. But as Americans bought more foreign goods, 
the investment cushion eroded and disappeared altogether in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
America's total debt is expected to top $1 trillion in the next few years as 
the current account deficit remains stuck around the $100-billion level. 
</P>
<P>
Foreigners now own more in U.S. assets than Americans own overseas, a 
development that has triggered debate over whether the United States is losing 
control of its economic destiny. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, like Ronald Reagan, has insisted that the growth of foreign 
investment in the United States is a sign of strength, showing that America 
remains attractive for investments. 
</P>
<P>
Many private economists fear, however, that Americans' living standards will be 
lowered in future years as more and more dollars flow into foreign hands to 
meet interest and dividend payments on the growing debt. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States is the world's biggest debtor and that is a big problem for 
the country," said Allen Sinai, chief economist of Boston Co. "Increasingly, 
the ravages of debt are showing up in this country." 
</P>
<P>
Sinai said the need for the Fed to keep interest rates high enough to attract 
foreign capital had already translated into slower growth in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
David Wyss, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill, predicted that the current 
account would worsen in 1990, after two years of improvement, reflecting slower 
growth in exports.

BUSINESS SURVEY RATES AMERICA AS 'UNFAIR PLAYER'

The United States, perhaps the most vocal champion of free trade, does not have 
that image in foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
A survey of 1,800 business leaders in 34 countries published Tuesday ranked the 
United States third among the world's most "unfair players" in international 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by the International Institute for Management 
Development, a Lausanne, Switzerland-based business school, and the World 
Economic Forum, which runs an annual businessmen's meeting in Davos. 
</P>
<P>
Japan was perceived by 52.19% of those polled as the most unfair player, 
followed by South Korea at 8.86% and the United States at 8%. 
</P>
<P>
The only European country to fall into the unfair player category was France at 
4.86%, which ranked fifth. It received almost as many votes as Taiwan, with 
6.57%. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil, with a reputation for aggressive export policy, placed sixth with 4%, 
the survey showed. 
</P>
<P>
Japan, despite being identified as the No. 1 unfair player, was not universally 
vilified by the survey. 
</P>
<P>
In ranking the three countries which are the best at turning innovations into 
competitive products, those polled lauded the record of Japan by an even 
greater margin, winning 73.99% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
The United States also redeemed itself by placing second with 10.33% while West 
Germany took third place with 2.66%. 
</P>
<P>
South Korea and Thailand were seen as the brightest rising stars of 
international business, polling 34.21% and 10.02% of the vote, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Spain, the only non-Asian country to make the top of the list, was rated as the 
fifth brightest of the rising stars, with 6.28%. 
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, the United States, Switzerland, West Germany, Britain, 
Japan and France, in that order, were perceived as resting on their laurels, 
complacent with past accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
"All are seen to be relaxing at a time when competitiveness is becoming more 
intense," the survey said.

Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher arrived Tuesday for three days of trade 
talks, and Japan acknowledged for the first time that the discussions have 
reached a "crisis" stage that could damage U.S.-Japan relations. 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher's visit was being viewed as a final push by the Administration to get 
stalemated trade talks back on track before U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. 
Hills delivers a crucial report to Congress on Japanese trade at the end of the 
month. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has warned that if the report contains no significant 
progress on U.S. demands to remove Japan's barriers to increased trade and 
investment, Congress is expected to increase the call for economic sanctions 
against Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Washington maintains that the only way to make a dent in the $49-billion annual 
trade deficit with Japan is for Japan to get its 122 million citizens to spend 
more, make it easier for American retailers to open stores in Japan and give 
its people a better life style. 
</P>
<P>
"If we fail to resolve (trade) problems, then it will be a very serious matter. 
In that sense, we feel this is a crisis," Japan's top government spokesman, 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Misoji Sakamoto, told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Japan Michael H. Armacost said in a speech in Tokyo this 
week: "If we can resolve trade problems in a spirit of friendship and equity, 
there are few limits to the possibilities of our wider partnership. 
</P>
<P>
"If we fail, our relationship will become more troubled, and our peoples alone 
will not be the only ones to experience the adverse consequences." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Embassy officials in Tokyo are billing Mosbacher's visit as a "low-key" 
affair expected to produce no breakthroughs in the trade dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher will open discussions Wednesday with Japanese Foreign Minister Taro 
Nakayama and newly appointed Minister for Trade and Industry Kaubun Muto. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, he meets Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and Finance Minister Ryutaro 
Hashimoto. 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher said in Washington before his departure that he wants to "make sure 
there is a clear understanding" between Bush and Kaifu following their summit 
meeting in Palm Springs earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu told Bush he would make the trade dispute "one of the top priorities" for 
his Cabinet but offered no specifics. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington on Tuesday, President Bush called Kaifu's statements at the time 
"very constructive" and discounted Japanese media reports criticizing the prime 
minister. Kaifu has been attacked for promising too much. 
</P>
<P>
"I think those reports just highlight the sensitivity of the situation in 
Japan, and I think as far as I'm concerned, the talks were very good," Bush 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, a heightened sense of urgency on the trade dispute was clearly 
evident among government ministries Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Nakayama told reporters, "We should realize that this issue 
amounts to crisis management in Japan-U.S. ties."

ANAHEIM, SANTA ANA PLAY RISKY GAME OVER ARENAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK LANDSBAUM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County's two biggest cities, engaged in a battle of municipal egos in a 
race to build indoor sports arenas, are taking significant risks by proceeding 
without commitments from pro sports teams, observers say. 
</P>
<P>
And although both cities are pledging to protect taxpayers from major costs, 
critics say a "frenzy" among cities to get pro franchises can undermine their 
bargaining power when dealing with team owners who can pit one arena offer 
against another. 
</P>
<P>
The way Los Angeles Raiders' owner Al Davis manipulated four cities until he 
received a $660-million deal from Oakland illustrates the pitfalls. One victim 
was Irwindale, which gave Davis a non-refundable $10 million as an incentive to 
move and ended up with nothing. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders need a football stadium. But the competition for basketball and 
hockey teams to play in multipurpose indoor arenas is no less intense. At the 
moment, for instance, seven California cities are hoping to lure -- or hang 
onto -- a pro basketball or hockey team. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim and Santa Ana -- despite differences in their financing schemes, 
timetables and plans for arena ownership -- face the same perils, according to 
people who have studied the public financing of sports facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"Any municipal government is far better off negotiating with potential tenants 
before they build (a sports facility) than building the thing and then hoping 
they get a tenant," said economist Stephen J.K. Walters of Loyola College, 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at the stadium as a hostage," said Walters, author of a paper on the 
Raiders' move to Los Angeles. "Once you've created this big asset that sits 
there and has no other alternative uses, you become specialized to a particular 
use or user. You will be . . . victimized." 
</P>
<P>
With each new arena, the chances of attracting one of the finite number of 
professional teams diminishes, said Robert Baade, a Lake College (Ill.) 
professor and author of studies on public financing of sports facilities for 
the Heartland Institute, a Chicago think tank. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the real frightening things in all of this is that cities are rushing 
willy-nilly into things," Baade said. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim and Santa Ana announced last year that private firms would finance 
indoor sports arenas and lure National Basketball Assn. or National Hockey 
League franchises. Proponents conceded that only one such arena could operate 
successfully. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana city officials are considering up to $10 million in public subsidies 
for their arena. Anaheim already has spent $18 million, raised a local tax and 
is considering an operating subsidy for its arena. 
</P>
<P>
League officials say it would be virtually impossible to get basketball and 
hockey franchises for each facility. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim, with an arena now estimated to cost $94 million, took an early lead. 
But in January a lawsuit by disgruntled neighbors over the arena's 
environmental report temporarily halted the project. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana, proceeding more conservatively, pulled even in the race with a 
$75-million arena proposal. Its environmental report won city approval last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way there have been some doubters. 
</P>
<P>
"We're giving and not getting; the people of Anaheim are just losing their 
butts on this . . . $17 million for land . . . a $15-million obligation for 10 
years," said Anaheim City Councilman Irv Pickler, a former advocate who cast 
the only dissenting arena vote. "It's way out of line. 
</P>
<P>
"We're taking all the risks, and I think the (developers) are just sitting back 
and seeing what they can get. The citizens are going to eat it all." 
</P>
<P>
A Times Poll in February found that 57% of Orange County residents do not 
believe that a sports arena is needed. Only 12% unequivocally favored spending 
public funds on such a facility. 
</P>
<P>
"There's this frenzy among the cities to get these franchises, even when most 
taxpayers in the city are against it," said Thomas W. Hazlett, professor of 
economics and public policy at UC Davis. "There still is a tremendous minority 
constituency of maniacal . . . fans that will support the politicians. . . . 
They get to give away the free tickets, and their big supporters will sit in 
the boxes with them." 
</P>
<P>
However, some parties do make money in the process: 
</P>
<P>
In Anaheim, six property owners have or soon will sell the city land for its 
arena. Their price: $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
The arenas have provided paydays for environmental consultants in Anaheim and 
Santa Ana, and a host of attorneys are being paid to haggle in and out of court 
over Anaheim's arena. 
</P>
<P>
Private investors who don't have to know Anaheim from Zanzibar will be paid 
$1.76 million a year -- a 9.1% return on their investment, exempt from state 
taxes -- for buying $18.7 million in bonds sold for Anaheim arena land 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
Ogden Corp. of New York proposes building and operating Anaheim's arena with 
entertainment bookings handled by the Nederlander Group. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Ana, Spectacor Management Group would operate the arena with bookings 
handled by MCA Entertainment Inc. 
</P>
<P>
King-Guanci Development Co. is in partnership with Spectacor and MCA 
Entertainment in the development. 
</P>
<P>
But Anaheim, which would own its arena, and Santa Ana, which would not, are not 
alone in the race to build arenas. Five other California cities -- San 
Francisco, San Jose, Oakland, Los Angeles and San Diego -- also plan arenas. 
</P>
<P>
There are a couple of hitches: Supply and demand. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are a franchise owner, there are many more cities that want you than 
there are franchises available," Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
Or in the words of Alfred Gobar, a Brea consultant who has worked on 25 arena 
and stadium proposals: "There is usually one more arena than there are 
ballclubs." 
</P>
<P>
This glut of demand, Walters said, creates a sellers' market -- and another 
hitch. 
</P>
<P>
The prevailing thinking is that a city must already have an arena to get a 
franchise. As reasonable as this may sound, some say it can be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"You are caught in a classic Catch-22," Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young said. 
"The NBA makes it real clear that they want the arena before they begin to talk 
about . . . a team coming." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the best offer will win the arena race. However, the best offer for 
a franchise may be wasteful from a taxpayers' point of view. 
</P>
<P>
Despite occasional assurances otherwise, taxpayers would be financial partners 
in the seven California arenas. 
</P>
<P>
The risks can be high. Already millions in public funds have been spent and 
millions more almost certainly will be -- much of it before anyone knows 
whether his city will have an arena or a team. 
</P>
<P>
"A franchise would be foolish to commit to an arena before it is open," said 
Marie Monet, president of Ogden Financial Services of New York, an Ogden Corp. 
subsidiary. "We would build that (Anaheim) arena with no commitments in place 
from a team." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Ogden won't build an arena until the city buys the land and agrees 
to other financial considerations still being negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
If after an arena is built it does not have a paying tenant, bills still must 
be paid for construction, for land and for overhead. 
</P>
<P>
Football and baseball stadiums are more vulnerable to this kind of 
exploitation, said Walters, because indoor arenas offer more alternative uses, 
including trade shows and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
But most observers concede that a sports team is needed to make an arena 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think it flies without a franchise," Anaheim Assistant City Manager 
James Ruth said. 
</P>
<P>
The sentiment is similar in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"If arenas were inherently profitable without a sports franchise, we would be 
building them all across the country on a speculative basis -- we're obviously 
not," said Don Webb, vice president of Spectacor Management Group, the world's 
largest operator of indoor arenas. 
</P>
<P>
Although Santa Ana and Anaheim city officials initially touted the private 
nature of their arenas, each city's financial involvement has grown. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Ana, the plan now is to limit public financing to an operating 
subsidy. In Anaheim, the city has spent money on land and intends to subsidize 
operating costs if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"The city of Anaheim is the owner ultimately (of its arena), as opposed to 
Santa Ana, where it will be privately constructed and owned by the developer 
and his partners," Young said. "We have not spent a dime of public money. 
</P>
<P>
"This project has to pencil as a private venture -- that's our requirement -- 
(it must be) financially a success and privately owned." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Santa Ana officials revealed in October that a $5-million subsidy 
in operating costs would be provided for their $75-million arena. 
</P>
<P>
"We were surprised when (the city) offered us that," said Tony Guanci, of 
King-Guanci Development Inc. "I believe they raised the ante a little bit 
because of what is going on in Anaheim." 
</P>
<P>
A little-noticed economic analysis prepared for Santa Ana in January indicates 
that the city is considering a larger subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
"The deal with the developer says that the city will assist the project by 
providing an annual subsidy of $1 million per year for the first 10 years," 
according to the analysis by Economics Research Associates of Los Angeles. 
"Thereafter, the city will participate in the profits of the project to 
recapture the subsidy." 
</P>
<P>
Closed-door negotiations in Santa Ana continue. 
</P>
<P>
Guanci said that his partners do not intend to finance construction of the 
Santa Ana arena. Investors, perhaps from Taiwan or Japan, will be sought for 
the construction money, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the costs are controlled properly and it's designed properly and some of 
our plans for city participation and sales levels are attained, we don't 
believe any of our partners will be financially responsible for anything," 
Guanci said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike in Santa Ana, the plan in Anaheim is for the developer to deed the 
building to the city and in return be awarded a 30-year lease to operate the 
arena. 
</P>
<P>
But ownership has its price. On Nov. 30, 1989, the Anaheim City Council issued 
$18.7 million in bonds to buy arena land and land for those displaced by the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
To pay off the bonds, the City Council increased a tax on the city's hotels and 
motels, which can be expected to pass it on to customers. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 of Anaheim's largest hoteliers were briefed on the bed-tax increase 
and apparently had no protest because the land also can be used for truck 
marshaling for trade shows at the Convention Center, said Bill Snyder of the 
Anaheim Convention Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
The increase will bring Anaheim's bed tax to 11%, compared to 7% in Las Vegas 
and 13.25% in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an easy tax to put on because you are not taxing the local constituency," 
said Richard J. Newman, president of the International Assn. of Convention and 
Visitor Bureaus, based in Champaign, Ill., and representing 360 visitor and 
convention bureaus. "The people from out of town don't have any say about how 
they are being taxed." 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim officials say the bed-tax increase more than covers the bond debt. If 
for some reason it does not, the bond's fine print requires the city to make 
payments "from any source of legally available funds." 
</P>
<P>
Officials pledge that property taxes wouldn't be used to pay the debt. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim's arena deal has yet to be approved by the City Council, and for the 
most part its terms remain secret. 
</P>
<P>
However, tentative agreements signed July 12, 1989, between Ogden and the city 
would have Anaheim provide an arena subsidy of up to $1.5 million a year for 10 
years, if the facility operates in the red. The city would be repaid with 
interest from the next year's arena revenue, if there is revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Finance Director George Ferrone said the city could recoup its 
investment by selling the property. "Whether we build an (arena) or don't . . . 
this is land in one of the hottest building areas in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
However, Anaheim Councilman Pickler disclosed in January that the city paid 
$3.2 million for one parcel appraised at less than half that price. (City Atty. 
Jack L. White said subsequent appraisal of furniture, fixtures and "good will" 
raised the value to $3 million.) 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we should be in the real estate business," Pickler said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Anaheim and Santa Ana both emphasize that local taxpayers won't be 
stuck with the arena bill, the source of Anaheim's operating subsidy has not 
been publicly identified. Santa Ana's subsidy is expected to come from 
increased property taxes generated by the arena -- not the city's general fund. 
</P>
<P>
"Politically it's important to make that distinction," said one Santa Ana 
council member who asked not to be identified. "If you build the arena, you 
qualify for taxes that you are creating." 
</P>
<P>
However, if a different development were built at the same location, the city 
would receive the increase in property taxes and would not have to pay a dime 
of it to the developer in subsidy, city planner Jeff Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
Arena proponents stress that their proposals are more than dollars and cents. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana's arena will create "positive regional and national exposure," and 
"enhance community and civic pride," boosters say. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Anaheim's arena will enhance "the entertainment capital of Southern 
California," as the city fathers like to call it. 
</P>
<P>
"I would argue that those arguments of civic image are important, but it's kind 
of a red herring," Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
"The (economic) downside is it could cost the city," said Anaheim Planning 
Commissioner Lewis Herbst, who voted against the arena's environmental report. 
</P>
<P>
"Why do we want to spend 85 million bucks until we find out for sure," Herbst 
asked when that was the estimated cost of the arena. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A TALE OF SEVEN CITIES 
</P>
<P>
California cities are planning luxurious indoor sports arenas to attract or 
hang on to professional sports franchises. 
</P>
<P>
OAKLAND 
</P>
<P>
Estimated cost: Unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Seating: 20,000 seats with 120 luxury suites. 
</P>
<P>
Pro team: The NHL's Minneapolis North Stars have talked with Oakland officials 
about moving, and an NHL expansion team is also a possibility. The NBA's Golden 
State Warriors already play in the existing Oakland Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Background: The Oakland Coliseum Arena Commission is considering tearing down 
its 14,000-seat arena and building a new facility complete with luxury boxes. 
The expense of demolishing the existing indoor arena, building a new one, 
revamping the Coliseum to regain the Raiders and possibly paying a franchise 
fee to the Raiders' Al Davis may be more than the community can afford. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SAN JOSE 
</P>
<P>
Estimated cost: $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
Seating: Up to 19,000, 22 luxury boxes with option to add 100 more. 
</P>
<P>
Pro team: Howard Baldwin, former owner of the NHL Hartford Whalers and Morris 
Belsberg, owner of Budget Rent-a-Car, are negotiating for the city to get an 
NHL expansion team. They are not seeking an NBA team, said Dean Munro, who 
spearheads the city's arena-franchise effort. Ground-breaking is expected in 
June or July. Construction should take 24 months. 
</P>
<P>
Background: In June 1988 voters approved a $100 million arena bond issue for 
the city's redevelopment agency. The debt is to be paid from property taxes on 
the improvements. San Jose, the third largest city on West Coast, has 2.5 
million people within 30 miles. "We've got the population base to support 
professional sports," Munro said. 'We show the facility in the third or fourth 
year of operation making money, even without a professional team." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
<P>
Estimated cost: $80 million. 
</P>
<P>
Seating: 20,000 seats, unknown number of luxury suites. 
</P>
<P>
Pro team: Possibly a NHL expansion team. Would be arena operator Spectacor 
Management Group, the same firm proposing new arenas in Santa Ana and Los 
Angeles "owns the Philadelphia Flyers," said Ed McGovern, assistant to the 
mayor. "Obviously they've got some . . . clout with the NHL on where an 
expansion franchise is going to be located." Spectacor Executive Vice President 
Don Webb said the San Francisco Arena is "a little further along...than Santa 
Ana." 
</P>
<P>
Background: The arena would be built on 12 acres in the city's Mission Bay 
200-acre redevelopment area owned by Santa Fe Pacific Realty, the same company 
that owns the arena land in Santa Ana. said voters will be asked to approve the 
entire Mission Bay project, but a separate agreement may be negotiated just for 
the arena if the ballot measure fails. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LOS ANGELES 
</P>
<P>
Estimated cost: $100 million to be financed by Spectacor Management Group. 
</P>
<P>
Seating: 20,000 seats with 200 luxury boxes. 
</P>
<P>
Pro team: NBA's Los Angeles Clippers 
</P>
<P>
Background: The Clippers, now playing in the Los Angeles Sports Arena, want a 
new facility with revenue from luxury suites. Clipper owner Donald Sterling 
says "We must have a new state-of-the-art facility to play in. That's 
absolutely mandatory." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ANAHEIM 
</P>
<P>
Estimated cost: $94 million, financing to be arranged by Ogden Corporation. 
</P>
<P>
Seating: 20,000, including 80 luxury boxes. 
</P>
<P>
Pro team: An NHL or NBA franchise. The Major Indoor Soccer League has indicated 
it may grant an expansion franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Background: A previous attempt to build an indoor arena and obtain an NBA 
expansion franchise failed in the mid-1980s. This time the city is opening its 
purse strings for land acquisition and even subsidize its operation, if 
necessary. A court challenge of the city's environmental study will delay 
ground-breaking at least to the next court hearing in May. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SANTA ANA 
</P>
<P>
Estimated cost: $75 million. 
</P>
<P>
Seating: 20,000, including 120 luxury suites. 
</P>
<P>
Pro team: An NHL or NBA franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Background: As in Anaheim, a prior attempt to build an arena in the mid-1980s 
failed, even though a $37 million bond issue was tentatively approved. A 
politically acceptable location for the arena could not be found because 
homeowners protested they did not want it in their back yards. This time the 
land is in place and there are only scattered complaints from the arena's 
neighbors in the mostly industrial and commercial neighborhood.Spectacor 
Management Group is expected to sign a development agreement this month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
<P>
Estimated cost: $120 million. 
</P>
<P>
Seating: 22,900 seats, 180 luxury suites. 
</P>
<P>
Pro team: NBA or expansion NHL team. 
</P>

Background: The NBA Clippers deserted San Diego in 1984 and three minor league 
hockey teams failed between 1966 and 1979. But millionaire Harry Cooper, who 
holds a 27-year lease to operate the city's existing 14,500-seat sports arena, 
says TV revenue has since changed the economics of hockey and basketball 
dramatically. "We're offering free rent for 40 years. We're letting all the 
(franchise) owners know that...there's (an arena) here they can start playing 
in immediately and a state-of-the-art one" proposed. Ground-breaking is 
targeted for March, 1992, and the grand opening for August, 1994.

WHAT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT THE ARENAS 
</P>
<P>
Irv Pickler, Anaheim Councilman -- "I think they (the NBA and NHL) are going to 
look at other areas where there are fewer teams." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Young, Santa Ana Mayor -- "Do we expect to have an NBA team? Yeah. Do we 
know when that is? We really don't have a clue." 
</P>
<P>
Marie Monet, President of Ogden Financial Services -- "The real risk of there 
not being a team would be Ogden's risk, not the community's." 
</P>
<P>
Miguel A. Pulido, Santa Ana City Councilman -- "The Angels and the Rams have 
proven there's an independent market in Orange County outside of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Harry Cooper, Plans his own arena in San Diego -- "The only way they (Orange 
County cities) are going to get a team is if the Lakers go there or the 
Clippers go there..." 
</P>
<P>
Douglas G. Logan, Vice president of Ogden Corp. -- "With the way television is 
fragmented, there is plenty of room in a market of that size." 
</P>
<P>
STADIUM DEALS -- Proposed arena operator may face a contractual conflict. C1

DAY CARE PROBED AFTER GIRL, 2, IS FOUND ON STREET

<P>
Cypress College officials are investigating the complaint of a nursing student 
who said the school's day-care center never noticed when her 2 1/2-year-old 
daughter disappeared on Monday and was discovered wandering near a busy 
intersection. 
</P>
<P>
Found by a stranger at 8:20 a.m., Katy Dunn was turned over to Buena Park 
police and then taken to the Orangewood Home for abused or abandoned children. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Dunn, 40, of Cypress said it was not until 4:45 p.m. that she discovered 
that her daughter was missing when she came to pick her up at the center. Only 
then, she said, did officials learn that the child had been lost and called 
police. 
</P>
<P>
Still Katy was unable to see her mother. It was not until Tuesday morning, 
officials said, that the child was released to her parents because social 
workers for the home were not available to confirm that Dunn was Katy's real 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
"My daughter probably felt so totally abandoned," Dunn said Tuesday. "I never 
felt so helpless." 
</P>
<P>
Cypress College President Kirk Avery later defended the staff, said the entire 
matter is under investigation and declared that a fence will be installed today 
around the center. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been kind of unusual. But I'm sure the staff followed policy right to 
the letter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm fully satisfied that the staff acted appropriately," Avery said. Avery 
also said he has not confirmed that the child was ever brought to the center. 
He declined, however, to allow The Times to review any of the center's records 
that would show whether Dunn followed procedures and signed her daughter into 
the center on Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn said she arrived at the center, where she has brought Katy for more than a 
year, at 8 a.m. Monday. The two walked to the center's front room, where there 
were several day-care workers and teachers, and Dunn wrote her daughter's name 
and the time on the log, she said. 
</P>
<P>
She then watched Katy put her lunch in her assigned cubbyhole and kissed her 
goodby. Dunn said she left the center thinking her daughter was being watched. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn said she came back for Katy at 4:45 p.m. after she had picked up her 
13-year-old daughter at junior high. A day-care center employee told Dunn that 
Katy had never arrived in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought 'Oh my God, Oh my God!' I thought I was going to pass out. I kept 
asking, 'Where is she? Where is she!' " Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
She found her daughter's peanut butter and jelly sandwich still in her 
cubbyhole. But her daughter was missing. 
</P>
<P>
Katy apparently had wandered out of the center shortly after her mother left 
her there. She was found at about 8:20 a.m by a Cypress College student who saw 
her walking along in a blue sweat suit at the southeast corner of Holder Street 
and Lincoln Avenue, Buena Park Detective Vern Wadell said. 
</P>
<P>
Holder Street is right behind the center's parking lot in the back. The front 
yard of the center does not have a gate. 
</P>
<P>
"She was really lucky she didn't get run over," Wadell said. "That's a very 
heavy thoroughfare because of all the students who go to the college." 
</P>
<P>
The student took the girl to a nearby fire station, where someone called the 
police. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a sharp kid. All she kept saying was, 'I want my mommy,' " Wadell said. 
</P>
<P>
But Katy did not know the name of the center or her own last name so the police 
took her to several nearby day-care centers. When no one recognized her, police 
took her to Orangewood in Orange, Wadell said. 
</P>
<P>
The center never reported the girl missing, Wadell said. 
</P>
<P>
It was after 5 p.m. when a day-care center employee called the police and 
learned that Katy was at Orangewood, Dunn said. But Dunn was told that she 
could not have Katy until Tuesday morning because social workers for the home 
were not available to confirm that she was the girl's real mother. 
</P>
<P>
Robert B. Theemling, executive director of Orangewood, said: "If there is no 
one who can verify that kid belonged to the mother, then the home had to delay 
her release to the following day." 
</P>
<P>
Debbie and Bill Dunn saw Katy again Tuesday morning, more than 24 hours after 
she was left at the center. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean I can't imagine what she must have been going through," Debbie Dunn 
said. "I really thought she was gone from us." 
</P>
<P>
The center cares for about 55 children a day and operates during day and 
evening sessions for the campus. It is owned and operated by the college and 
has a state license, Avery said. The care center serves mainly students and 
staff members of the two-year community college.

CENSUS FALLING SHORT IN O.C. WORKER POOL; 
</P>
<P>
POPULATION: U.S. AGENCY ALSO ENCOUNTERS DIFFICULTY ATTRACTING JOB APPLICANTS IN 
OTHER AREAS. IT BLAMES THE LOW UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AND A ROBUST ECONOMY.

<P>
U.S. Census officials in California expressed concern Tuesday that the agency 
has failed so far to attract a large-enough pool of applicants to tap for the 
temporary work force needed to count heads in the state starting in April. 
</P>
<P>
Census offices up and down the state have experienced problems finding workers 
to fill posts, with the situation particularly acute in urban sections of 
Northern California as well as Orange, Los Angeles and San Diego counties, 
federal authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Although census officials had hoped to assemble a list of about 250,000 people 
to draw from when the tally kicks into high gear in April, only about 75,000 
potential employees have signed up for nearly 40,000 jobs, census officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's widespread," said Barbara Keller, the Los Angeles-based census recruiting 
coordinator in California. "We're concerned, so we're trying everything we can 
to recruit more people." 
</P>
<P>
As part of the once-a-decade head count, the U.S. Census Bureau pulls together 
an army of about 500,000 workers nationwide to fill temporary jobs as 
enumerators, clerical workers and data processors. Most of the positions last 
only a few months, with the bulk of the workers coming aboard next month as the 
agency begins the laborious task of tracking down residents who fail to mail 
back the census form by the first week of April. 
</P>
<P>
Census officials in the state had hoped to develop a pool of applicants large 
enough to ensure that there would be no labor shortages. With the relatively 
modest wages (most posts pay about $7.50 an hour) and temporary nature of the 
jobs, many qualified employees have already moved on to other work by the time 
the Census Bureau calls. Others can't be reached or simply decide not to take a 
position. Still others take the jobs, then later quit. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, authorities set a goal of 68,000 people in the applicant 
pool, but have attracted just 22,000 so far for the 9,000 to 12,000 jobs that 
will be filled in the weeks to come, Keller said. San Diego County has 
experienced a similar shortage, with 6,000 applicants instead of the goal of 
18,000. 
</P>
<P>
The situation is even worse in Orange County, where a list of about 3,500 
workers has been compiled, far short of the 15,000 that census officials had 
hoped for, Keller said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're starting to see our applicant pool thin out, so we're concerned that if 
this rate continues over the next two or three weeks we won't have enough 
workers come census day," said Fernando Tafoya, manager of the Santa Ana 
district office. 
</P>
<P>
"If this continues, we'll almost be at the mercy of people's good will," Tafoya 
said. "We'll be hoping that people don't resign or get other jobs." 
</P>
<P>
The dearth of applicants for the temporary jobs is probably due to the economic 
vitality and low unemployment rate in the state, Keller and other census 
officials speculate. In particular, urban areas such as Orange County enjoy 
some of the most robust economies in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
If a large enough work force isn't assembled, the shortfall could pose 
problems, authorities said. The counting process could be slowed, raising 
costs, because district offices would have to remain open longer than 
anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, any delay in tallying the populace could color results, Keller said. 
Census workers might be put in a position of arriving at homes months after the 
official April 1 census day, only to find the occupants have moved on without 
being recorded, she suggested. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're trying to do is get a snapshot of America on April 1," Keller said. 
"If people have moved or something has changed by the time we reach them, it 
creates problems." 
</P>
<P>
She said the agency is redoubling its recruitment efforts, taking out 
advertisements in newspapers, sponsoring public service announcements on the 
radio and "hitting the pavement" with recruiters. In Orange County, for 
example, census officials plan to host a job fair at various sites around the 
county on March 31. 
</P>
<P>
Census officials in Washington were either unavailable or declined to comment 
on the agency's recruitment efforts across the country. But officials in 
various regional offices reported a variety of symptoms similar to 
California's, although not as acute. 
</P>
<P>
"In our region overall, we're doing fine," said Malee Craft, recruitment 
coordinator in the Denver region, where there are 50,000 applicants for 18,000 
jobs in eight states. "But we do have some areas where our pools are lower than 
expected." 
</P>
<P>
Roy McCoy, a spokesman for the Chicago regional office, said the Census Bureau 
has attracted about 35% of the applicants it had hoped for, but the recruitment 
efforts have just recently kicked off in several parts of the three-state 
region of Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you'll find everyone is running a little bit under what they'd hoped 
for all across the United States," he said.

ANAHEIM FACES A $9-MILLION COST OVERRUN 
</P>

Higher than expected construction bids on the proposed Anaheim indoor sports 
arena have created a potential $9-million cost overrun and may force Anaheim 
officials to help make up the difference or look for another company to build 
and operate the facility, city officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
What is described as a "critical" meeting will be held Thursday at City Hall 
among representatives of the facility's developer, Ogden Corp., city officials 
and consultants who claim the developer's estimates are too high, Assistant 
City Manager James Ruth said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Although construction costs for the 20,000-seat arena originally were estimated 
at $85 million, bids came in at $94 million, Ruth said. Unless the increased 
costs can be cut or shared by the developer or the booking agent -- the 
Nederlander Group -- Anaheim may be forced to find another developer, Ruth 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think (the arena) is in danger," Ruth said. "It's a matter of if you 
don't work it out with (the original developer), work it out with someone else. 
If we decide we can build it for less, then we probably will proceed" with 
Ogden. 
</P>
<P>
Ogden and Nederlander officials could not be reached for comment Monday and 
Tuesday, and the company's negotiating agent, Los Angeles attorney Neil 
Papiano, did not return calls from a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth said the city has no alternative developer in mind, although "we have had 
people who have expressed strong interests in the project." 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Bob Simpson said Tuesday he believes the city will continue with 
Ogden. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just what the meeting is all about," Simpson said. However, he said, he 
does not believe the City Council will be willing to pick up additional costs 
for the arena. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim already has issued $18.7 million in bonds and raised the local 
hotel-motel bed tax to pay them off in order to finance acquisition of land for 
the arena. A tentative financial agreement with Ogden also calls for the city 
to subsidize up to $1.5 million a year in operating costs, which would be 
repaid from arena profits the following year. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth said Ogden's original construction estimates were based on comparable 
arenas built out of state, where labor is cheaper. However, the city has been 
advised by two "outside consultants" that the arena can still be built for its 
original $85-million price tag, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are still hopeful of getting the arena program together," Ruth said. "But 
we don't want to diminish the quality of the arena" by cutting back on 
amenities.

MORE FUEL ADDED TO BATTLE OVER ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHANNON SANDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With more than $10,000 of city money already spent in legal battling over the 
April City Council election, the controversy maintains momentum. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, City Clerk Mary E. Wynn appealed a decision by a Superior Court 
judge. That judge had refused to order two councilmen to approve a city 
resolution necessary to hold the election. 
</P>
<P>
Wynn sued the City Council on Feb. 26 after its four members deadlocked on the 
resolution, which provides for the location of polling places, the hiring of 
precinct workers and ballot counting. Her suit claimed that the state Election 
Code requires council members to adopt the resolution, usually a routine 
housekeeping matter. 
</P>
<P>
Although Mayor Richard B. Edgar and Councilwoman Ursula E. Kennedy support the 
election and voted for the resolution, Councilmen John Kelly and Earl J. 
Prescott are opposed to April elections in principle and want to block the 
balloting. 
</P>
<P>
Wynn's suit claimed that a court order is necessary to carry out the election, 
but after a meeting of key city officials late Friday afternoon she issued an 
order establishing the election details. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prescott and Kelly, an incumbent in the election, are planning their 
own legal actions. Prescott filed a complaint in Superior Court last Thursday 
asking that the ordinance changing the election to April be ruled invalid. 
</P>
<P>
Another action tentatively scheduled to be filed in court Thursday will 
incorporate that complaint and seek to prevent the April election, Prescott 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Prescott and Kelly allege that only two legitimate council members attended the 
council meeting on Nov. 20 when the majority voted to move the election from 
November to April. The two councilmen boycotted that meeting on the advice of 
their attorney after unsuccessfully seeking a court order to prevent former 
Councilman Ronald B. Hoesterey from voting. They claim that Hoesterey had 
already moved from the city. 
</P>
<P>
Edgar and Kennedy defend Hoesterey's resident status at that time and the 
legality of the ordinance, but Prescott says the election being planned is a 
"lawless election." SHANNON SANDS

SIGLER PARK AREA ENJOYS RENAISSANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
People who live near Sigler Park once feared the place, with its crime, 
vandalism and gangs. The gang problems became so severe that in 1986, the city 
canceled all organized recreation activities there. 
</P>
<P>
Now, thanks to the efforts of the city and a group of neighbors, Sigler Park 
has rebounded. Police say crime is down, a once-serious graffiti problem has 
been nearly eradicated and the city has brought back the park's recreation 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"Sigler Park is not as much of a concern to police as it once was," said 
Officer Mitch Waller, assistant to Police Chief James Cook. "The gang that once 
frequented the area does not congregate at the park any more. While gang crime 
is increasing in the city, it has decreased in the Sigler Park area." 
</P>
<P>
This is a far cry from the climate of Feb. 25, 1979, when a 24-year-old man was 
shot to death as he walked through Sigler Park. In 1988, two former gang 
members from the area were later convicted of the slaying, said Westminster 
Police Detective Michael Proctor. That same year, the neighborhood around the 
park was rocked by the death of 18-year-old Frank Martinez, who was shot by 
police in the back yard of his home during a scuffle at a birthday party. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the hostility directed toward the police in the aftermath of that 
shooting appears to have faded. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're finding in the Sigler Park area is that in our contact with the 
citizens, we have a better rapport," Waller said. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the transformation is being credited to a neighborhood organization 
called Manos Unidas, which means United Hands in Spanish. The group was 
originally formed to provide support to Martinez's family after his death, said 
Vera Palomino, who founded the group with her husband, Jay. 
</P>
<P>
The group has since widened its focus and successfully lobbied the city to 
begin an evening recreation program for teens. Group members have coordinated 
cleanup drives at the park and have raised money for scholarships and 
excursions for local youths. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of their work, the Palominos will be honored March 25 by the Orange 
County Human Relations Commission for "fostering mutual understanding and 
respect among people." 
</P>
<P>
"People got tired of reading about how bad Sigler Park was with gangs," Vera 
Palomino said. "It had gotten to the point where the bad kids had taken over 
the park and no one would take a stand. It's just a very few who give the park 
a bad name. What we're trying to do is give the park a better name." 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Jerry Kenny said the city is trying to help by repaving streets, 
installing a sidewalk around the park and making improvements to the restroom 
and barbecue areas. New playground equipment is due in about a year. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to show the people out there that we care," Kenny said. "The 
people who live around there have been instrumental in making it a better area 
and have been working with the city to get the work done." 
</P>
<P>
Now, on most weekday afternoons, the park off Olive Street near Westminster 
Boulevard is filled with children. Recreation leader Sandy Martinez said the 
program is important to them because many come from low-income families. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of these kids are waiting for us each day," she said. "They don't have 
many toys to play with at home." 
</P>
<P>
While Martinez and co-worker Christina Hoffman organize afternoon activities 
such as sports and arts and crafts for children under 13, John Rey Adame 
operates the teen program on Tuesday and Thursday evenings. 
</P>
<P>
The program has been temporarily suspended because Adame was in a car accident 
last month. He is scheduled to return March 21 and resume his "rap sessions" 
and racquetball, handball and basketball tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
"The older kids were being neglected as far as having organized activities at 
the park," Palomino said. "From what we see and hear, John Rey has made a big 
difference. You don't see graffiti like you used to and you don't see the older 
men in their 20s drinking beer at the park and leaving behind their bottles. I 
think word has gotten around that Sigler Park isn't the place to do that kind 
of thing any more." GREG HERNANDEZ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COAST PANEL STAFF BACKS MOLA PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The staff of the California Coastal Commission is recommending approval of a 
developer's restoration plan for 41.4 acres of wetlands in northwest Seal 
Beach. The commission is scheduled to vote on the plan today. 
</P>
<P>
Mola Development Corp. is financing and coordinating the $4-million, five-year 
program in exchange for approval of the company's planned development by the 
commission and city. Mola wants to build a $300-million, 329-unit residential 
development on the Hellman Ranch property, adjacent to the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
The commission conditionally approved the development earlier this year and 
asked Mola to revise and resubmit the restoration plan. 
</P>
<P>
Commission staff had asked Mola to obtain an endorsement of the plan from 
California Department of Fish and Game and to modify the plan to include an 
additional two acres of low marsh habitat. 
</P>
<P>
Mola has complied with the requests and should have no problem getting approval 
for the plan, staff analyst Larry Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
The 41.4-acre wetlands will include nine acres of open water and 31 of high and 
low marsh habitat. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very exciting restoration project," said Mola project director Kirk 
Evans.

GREEN FEES TO RISE AT CITY GOLF COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Green fees at Fullerton Golf Course will go up slightly April 1 to pay for 
improvements and higher maintenance costs. 
</P>
<P>
An 18-hole round of golf will increase from $10 to $11 on weekdays, and from 
$14.50 to $15 on weekends. The cost of a bucket of balls for the driving range 
will increase 25 cents for all three bucket sizes. Electric cart rentals will 
increase by $1. 
</P>
<P>
The increased fees will help pay for major improvements at the course, 
including installation of concrete paths for golf carts, Community Services 
director Ronald E. Hagan said. 
</P>
<P>
The last fee increase at the city-owned golf course occurred in June, 1989.

DEVELOPER GIVES UP ON JAZZ CLUB PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A local developer has abandoned plans to open a downtown jazz club because of 
the city's building moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
The freeze on all new construction was imposed in January by a City Council 
concerned about potential water shortages this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The jazz club would have occupied a former bank building, but the moratorium 
also prohibits any renovation that would increase water use by 25%. 
</P>
<P>
"The City Council imposed a broad, sweeping law, and we just got caught up in 
it," developer Ray Campbell said. "I'm tired of fighting for this." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell's club on north El Camino Real was approved last November by the City 
Council, despite complaints from some downtown residents that the night spot 
would cause parking and traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
"It just took the pleasure out of the effort," Campbell said of the moratorium. 
"I've got other things to do than to hassle it out for another 10 months."

COUNCIL MAY TURN PARKING CLOCK BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A decision to extend the hours on some parking meters until 10 p.m. may be 
modified this month because merchants have complained that the new policy is 
bad for business. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council decided during a study session this week to prepare a 
resolution for the March 26 meeting that would limit parking meter hours to 
between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m., city traffic engineer Richard M. Edmonston said. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the change would take effect immediately. 
</P>
<P>
In January, the city extended the meter times from 5 p.m. to either 6 p.m. or 
10 p.m. to generate revenue for law enforcement and litter control. 
</P>
<P>
Parking meters earned just over $1 million for Newport Beach last year, 
according to Edmonston. There was no study on how much money would have been 
generated by extending the time on the meters, he said.

DEMOCRAT INELIGIBLE TO RUN FOR CONGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The only Democratic candidate who filed to run against Rep. Ron Packard 
(R-Carlsbad) was declared ineligible Tuesday because he did not submit enough 
signatures with his application. 
</P>
<P>
George E. Hollis, an optical engineer, submitted the $1,207 filing fee by the 
deadline last Friday, but he was nine signatures short of the number required 
to qualify for the race. 
</P>
<P>
The registrar's office said Hollis had 31 valid signatures and the application 
requires 40. To be valid, the signatures must be from voters registered within 
the district and in the same party as the candidate. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Orange County registrar's office completed an audit of the 
applications it received on the Friday deadline. There were no other 
applications for county, state or federal office that were invalidated. 
</P>
<P>
Hollis was unavailable for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Packard's district includes San Juan Capistrano and San Clemente in Orange 
County as well as most of northern San Diego County. Besides Packard, there are 
two minor party candidates in the race. 
</P>
<P>
Packard, 59, was first elected in 1982 as a write-in. In 1988, he beat Democrat 
Howard Greenebaum 72% to 26%.

3 ROB FASHION ISLAND STORE OF $100,000 IN GEMS

Three armed bandits robbed a Newport Center Fashion Island jewelry store 
Tuesday, escaping with more than $100,000 in diamonds and other valuables, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
"It appeared to be smooth, professional and well-planned," Police Sgt. Andy 
Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
The robbery occurred about 6:25 p.m. when the three masked men entered Moboco 
Fine Jewelry &amp; Gems in the 200 block of Newport Center Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The bandits -- at least two of whom were armed -- walked into the store's outer 
lobby and kicked in a security door to gain access to the showroom area, Gonis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Eight employees and customers were held at gunpoint while the bandits grabbed 
several pieces of jewelry from the top of the display cases. 
</P>
<P>
No shots were fired and no one was injured, Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
An employee activated an alarm that signaled a robbery in progress, and police 
arrived at the store about a minute later, Gonis said. "But they (robbers) were 
gone," he said. "No one saw a car leave. They were in and out in a flash." 
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, three men attempted to rob a jewelry store at South Coast Plaza 
in Costa Mesa but fled empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
It was not known if the two incidents are connected.

365 POUNDS OF COCAINE SEIZED BY INVESTIGATORS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County narcotics officers seized 365 pounds of cocaine in Los Angeles 
County over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators from the county's Regional Narcotics Suppression Program found 
the cocaine Saturday in three cars that were under surveillance, spokesman Lt. 
Tom Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
The officers also searched two homes in Valinda and Los Angeles, where they 
seized about $100,000, two assault rifles, a rifle with a silencer and a 
semiautomatic pistol. 
</P>
<P>
The street value of the cocaine was estimated to be $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested Felipe Padilla Gomez, 42, Rufina Serrano Candeo, 27, Miguel 
Nagera Rodriguez, 47, and Roberto Roman Landeros, 41, in connection with the 
drugs. The suspects were booked into Los Angeles County Jail for possession and 
transportation of cocaine. Bail has been set at $1 million for each suspect. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the investigators followed an unidentified driver from Orange 
County to the La Puente Hills Mall in the City of Industry and then to the 
other houses in Los Angeles and Valinda, Davis said. The driver of the car was 
under surveillance as a suspected narcotics dealer, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
The cocaine was found mostly in the trunks of three cars, including a 1977 
Lincoln with a hidden compartment that was electronically controlled, Davis 
said.

NEW DETAILS EMERGE IN JUDGES' ALLEGED EFFORT TO THWART INQUIRY OF PEERS;

ALLEGED THAT SOME HARBOR JUDGES WENT TOO FAR IN TRYING TO DEFEND THEIR 
COLLEAGUES.

<P>
Previously private files were released Tuesday on a now-closed investigation of 
Harbor Court judges, providing new details of a meeting in which three judges 
allegedly tried to thwart the Newport Beach Police Department's inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
A two-foot stack of Orange County district attorney investigative records, made 
available to The Times' Orange County Edition and the Orange County Register, 
show that prosecutors spent more than four years intermittently investigating 
Harbor judges Brian R. Carter and Calvin P. Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
The two were accused of using their positions on the bench to help their 
friends and to seek sexual favors from prostitutes. But the district attorney's 
inquiry was eventually closed without charges being filed, and the case was 
turned over in 1988 to a state judicial inquiry commission. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to be as thorough as we could in either confirming or negating 
allegations made," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Wallace J. Wade, in charge of 
special assignments. "But after four or five years of looking at this, we just 
felt that we did not have a case against anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt received a public rebuke last year from the state Commission on 
Judicial Performance for helping the stepdaughter of a good friend who had 
appeared in his courtroom. He was cleared, however, of all other accusations 
against him, including one involving a prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
Carter resigned from the bench in February, 1989, to avoid facing a similar 
state inquiry. Shortly before he stepped down, it was revealed that Carter -- 
in a telephone conversation tape-recorded by investigators -- had asked a 
prostitute to meet him for "love and friendship." 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt on Tuesday declined to discuss the newly released material. But one of 
his closest colleagues on the Harbor bench, Judge Selim S. Franklin, told The 
Times: "It's all water over the damn for (Schmidt)." 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to reach Carter were unsuccessful Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office released investigative files on Carter last year 
after his resignation. But the files released Tuesday cover all inquiries into 
any of the judges in Harbor Court and show that the bulk of the complaints were 
against Carter instead of Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the material -- released after the newspapers filed a request under the 
California Public Records Act -- was a repeat of the previously released Carter 
information. 
</P>
<P>
One new memo from the file, however, described the frustration of trying to 
investigate the judges when many witnesses refused to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Wade said Tuesday that while he did not want to comment on the 
quality of all of the witnesses his office had to deal with, "some of the 
witnesses we believed were being very truthful with us, particularly the people 
from the city of Newport Beach." 
</P>
<P>
The new material released Tuesday shows that prosecutors paid considerable 
attention to complaints from Newport Beach city officials who alleged that some 
of the Harbor judges went too far in trying to defend their two colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the judges -- Franklin, Christopher J. Strople and Russell A. Bostrom 
-- met with Newport Beach Police Chief Art Campbell on May 4, 1987, to discuss 
the Police Department's part in the investigation of Judge Carter, the files 
show. 
</P>
<P>
Existence of the meeting had been made public before and the judicial 
performance commission reviewed the allegations and took no action against the 
three judges. But the district attorney files provide the most detailed account 
of what investigators were told. 
</P>
<P>
According to the documents, Campbell told investigators that the judges were 
upset that a telephone conversation between Carter and a former client had been 
tape-recorded and that the incident was "hurting your relationship with the 
courts." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell also said that "one of the judges" wanted the department's primary 
investigator, Sgt. Richard Long, pulled off the case, charging that he had a 
vendetta against the judges. The police chief said that "Bostrom indicated that 
the attorney general's office might be called in to look at the propriety of 
investigating Judge Carter." 
</P>
<P>
Bostrom, who is no longer on the bench, refused comment when asked about the 
reports on Tuesday. Strople also declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
On May 29, 1987, Bostrom and Franklin met with Newport Beach City Manager 
Robert Wynn and two members of the City Council. Records show that Wynn told 
investigators that "Franklin stated that the investigation was hindering good 
relations between the court and the city and should be stopped or concluded." 
Wynn added that Franklin complained that Sgt. Long "is too persistent in the 
investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Wynn reported that he told the judges it was highly inappropriate for elected 
council members to impose their judgment on the Police Department in a criminal 
investigation. Wynn said Franklin told him that he agreed, but that "for the 
sake of harmony, something should be done in this instance." 
</P>
<P>
Franklin, reached at his chambers, had a different recall of that meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't pressuring; we were stating our concerns," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin said the judges met with the city officials only because the police 
chief did not seem responsive to their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that bothered us was that they would not come to our senior judges 
and let us know they had a problem," Franklin said. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney reports also indicate that Carter complained to two 
members of the City Council about the police investigation. 
</P>
<P>
One district attorney memo states: "It was (Councilwoman Evelyn R.) Hart's 
understanding that Judge Carter wanted the city officials to apply some type of 
pressure on the Police Department." 
</P>
<P>
The reports released by the district attorney's office Tuesday include one 
complaint by a former deputy district attorney about Bostrom's conduct during a 
plea-bargaining session in chambers. The woman reported that Bostrom was trying 
to pressure her into agreeing to "a better deal" for a defendant. When the 
prosecutor retorted that such a deal would be "offensive and unethical," 
Bostrom responded: "You and I know what goes on. Maybe you're naive . . . but 
you know there are things that go on in this county that, ah, would really 
surprise you."

IRVINE OKS MEDFLY TASK FORCE; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: GROUP WILL BE FORMED TO STUDY WHETHER CITY SHOULD JOIN OTHERS IN 
OPPOSING AERIAL SPRAYING. ITS REPORT IS EXPECTED IN JUNE.

<P>
Fearing that its orange groves, avocado fields and other agricultural areas 
could make Irvine Orange County's next victim of the Mediterranean fruit fly, 
the City Council on Tuesday voted unanimously to establish a task force to 
review the city's options for combatting the pest. 
</P>
<P>
The task force, which includes representatives of the Irvine Co., farming 
companies and educational institutions, will review aerial spraying and debate 
whether or not Irvine should join with other Orange County cities in opposing 
it. It is expected to issue its report in June. 
</P>
<P>
So far, aerial spraying in the county is restricted to an eight-square-mile 
area around Brea and a 36-square-mile area that includes parts of Garden Grove, 
Westminster, Huntington Beach and six other central county cities. 
</P>
<P>
"This council is trying to get out front of this issue before they discover a 
Medfly here," said Michael S. Brown, the city's environmental program 
administrator. If Medflies do appear within the city limits, Brown added, 
Irvine would be "left with very little time to react." 
</P>
<P>
The task force, which will be an advisory body to the council, faces a delicate 
balancing act, as Irvine has a large and influential agricultural community -- 
more than 10,000 acres of land in and around the city are farmed -- in addition 
to a powerful environmental constituency. Satisfying both those groups will 
prove challenging and could make Irvine one of Southern California's most 
volatile battlegrounds over the aerial spraying, observers agreed. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the City Council could find itself in an uncomfortable situation. 
The council has lobbied to keep a portion of Irvine in agricultural production, 
but at the same time, many council members, including Mayor Larry Agran, enjoy 
strong support from environmentalists. Malathion spraying could divide those 
constituencies before the city's June 5 election. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of pressure could be brought to bear," said Howard Fishbein, an 
Irvine physician who has volunteered to serve on the task force. "But before we 
start spraying a substance like malathion, I'd like to see us have some more 
objective information about it." 
</P>
<P>
On the other side, farmers said Irvine's strong environmental constituency 
could make it a powerful adversary of spraying. However, the farmers added, 
they have a huge economic stake in doing everything possible to control the 
pest. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be an interesting case study if it comes down to spraying in 
this area," said Peter Changala, manager of the agricultural division of the 
Irvine Co. "It's a very tough thing to address in this community." 
</P>
<P>
Carl Lindgren, general manager of Treasure Farms, said farmers would prefer not 
to spray but that they have few options once Medflies appear.

MATER DEI'S NO. 1 AGAIN; ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THE SPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two years ago, the Mater Dei High School baseball team won 21 games with a 
talented outfield of Mike Basse, Larry Sutton and Jim Austin, all of whom 
signed with Division I colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Mater Dei won 22 games with an equally talented pitching staff that 
featured Tony Pena (12-1) and Scott Corliss (7-2). 
</P>
<P>
This season, Mater Dei should continue its winning ways with a stellar infield 
that Coach Bob Ickes thinks could be comparable to his previous outfield and 
pitching stars. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei, which finished second in the county poll the past two seasons, is 
the top-ranked team in The Times' preseason baseball poll. 
</P>
<P>
1. MATER DEI 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Lionel Hastings, a gifted hitter with a strong arm, is the catalyst 
of the infield. Hastings has made an oral commitment to USC and Ickes thinks he 
will start for the Trojans as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
First baseman Jim McCarthy, sidelined with injuries the past two years, finally 
gets his chance to play. Doug DeJardin starts at second base and Ryan Andersen 
is at third. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all Division I prospects," Ickes said. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei, 6-2 with losses to Capistrano Valley and Irvine, is batting .350 as 
a team. In the recent Newport-Tustin tournament, Mater Dei scored 23 runs in 
the championship game against Foothill. 
</P>
<P>
"Year in and year out, we're going to score runs," Ickes said. "But we've never 
been questionable on the mound. We don't have a No. 1 on the mound, they're all 
equal. We're just hoping for consistency." 
</P>
<P>
Pena, the county's player of the year in 1989, is now at Arizona State. Three 
starters -- Jason Deitrick, Colin Gawlonski and Sean Sutton -- are vying for 
the top spot in the Mater Dei rotation. Mike Ferletic is the team's top relief 
pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"I've used eight pitchers," Ickes said. "We knew going into the season we were 
undermanned, but our depth could confuse some teams if we use the right pitcher 
in the right situation." 
</P>
<P>
Despite an inexperienced pitching staff, Ickes likes his team's chances 
</P>
<P>
"We had the same question marks in 1980 with our pitching staff, and we went 
all the way (won the 4-A title) that year," he said. "You just never know." 
</P>
<P>
2. OCEAN VIEW 
</P>
<P>
A trio of talented left-handed pitchers -- Randy Karliner, Jim Gwaltney and 
Eric Schaff -- gives Ocean View one of the best starting rotations in the 
county. Karliner won eight of 11 games as a sophomore and was a first-team 
all-league selection last year. Schaff was injured most of last season but is 
one of the most improved players on the team. 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Daniel Hernandez batted .378 and was a Times' all-county selection as 
a junior last year. Few can match Hernandez's defensive skills in the infield 
and he is expected to attract a lot of attention from major league scouts. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Steve Barrett thinks Scott Caringella is the best outfielder in the 
Sunset League. "Pitching, pitching and more pitching will be our strength," 
Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View was the runner-up in the 32-team Loara tournament last week, losing 
to nationally ranked Lakewood, 9-3, in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
3. KATELLA 
</P>
<P>
Returning all-league third baseman Dennis Briggs and shortstop Jamie Vitzelio 
give Katella a solid infield. Katella scored seven runs on three home runs to 
beat Servite in the third-place game of the Loara tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody from our No. 1 to No. 9 batter is hitting the ball," said Tim 
McMenamin, Katella's coach. Katella has a .375 team batting average in 
preseason play. 
</P>
<P>
Briggs is batting .647 with 11 hits in 17 at-bats in five games and newcomer 
Eric Boyd has been a pleasant surprise in the outfield, batting .562. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Allen, formerly Danny Kirker, is the team's top pitcher. Allen allowed 
only two earned runs in Katella's only loss to Ocean View. Catcher Jess Evans 
has made a successful transition from the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
4. SERVITE 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen returning varsity players, including seven starters, should help 
Servite turn around a mediocre 1989 season in which the Friars finished 
11-12-1. Cliff Mierendorf anchors a solid pitching staff. Shortstop Ed Crippin 
and first baseman Rob Walker are among the team's top hitters. 
</P>
<P>
Crippin batted .362 and had 11 stolen bases last season and Walker, the team's 
best power hitter, batted .464 with eight doubles. Catcher Ryan Boucher is one 
of the top defensive players in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"We will produce runs with power and a good bench," said Mike McNary, Servite's 
coach. "We have high hopes for a turnaround season with every starter having at 
least one year of varsity experience. We could battle Mater Dei for the Angelus 
League championship." 
</P>
<P>
Servite will play at Mater Dei Saturday in the league opener. 
</P>
<P>
5. TUSTIN 
</P>
<P>
The Tillers shared the Sea View League title with Estancia last year and 
advanced to the Southern Section 3-A semifinals. This should be another banner 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Two-year starter Dan Baker, who struck out 100 batters in 74 innings last year, 
has opened with victories over Esperanza and Mission Viejo in 1990. Two juniors 
-- outfielder Shawn Green and shortstop Ben Munoz -- are the Tillers' top 
hitters. Green is batting over .500 in six games. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin scored 54 runs in four games in the Irvine tournament and was held to 
less than 10 runs in only two games all summer. 
</P>
<P>
"We're swinging the bat pretty well," said Vince Brown, who has been head coach 
at Tustin for the past five seasons. "The team is batting over .350 and I have 
three players hitting over .450. I think we have the makings of the best team 
since I've been here." 
</P>
<P>
6. EDISON 
</P>
<P>
Consistently one of the county's top programs, Edison slumped to a 9-13-2 
record in 1989 after injuries to its top two pitchers. Jim Futami tore an arm 
muscle in Edison's fifth league game but returns healthy. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Steve Thobe, a 6-foot-5, 225-pound senior, has hit three home runs in 
six games and has a fine arm. Shortstop James Eidam and second baseman Rocky 
Balch return. 
</P>
<P>
Three stars on Edison's football team -- Donnie Smith, Brian Higgins and Chad 
Ponegalek -- also will play key roles. Ponegalek is the team's leadoff hitter 
and has good speed. 
</P>
<P>
"We have good pitching, speed and contact hitters," said Paul Harrell, Edison 
coach. "After last year, the key will be trying to keep our pitchers healthy." 
</P>
<P>
7. LOARA 
</P>
<P>
After losing eight of their first 11, Loara was the surprise winner of the 
Empire League last year. Joey Gaudio is the ace of a solid pitching staff and 
also plays the outfield. He won four games and batted .367 last year. Catcher 
Chris Hoffman is the team's best player, coming off a junior year in which he 
batted .333 and struck out only four times. 
</P>
<P>
"We have eight returners with valuable experience and four quality pitchers," 
said Rob Megill, Loara's coach. "As our pitching goes, we will go." 
</P>
<P>
8. LOS ALAMITOS 
</P>
<P>
All-county quarterback Todd Gragnano is equally impressive throwing a baseball, 
and along with outfielder Tony Napolitano, gives Los Alamitos a strong team. 
</P>
<P>
Gragnano won four games as a junior and batted .318. Another football standout, 
Brian Havens, returns after batting .370 with 19 RBIs as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
Napolitano is one of the premier players in the county. Last season, he batted 
.427 with six home runs and 26 RBIs. "Hitting will be our strength," Los 
Alamitos Coach Mike Gibson said. "We don't have much team speed and our 
pitching is a big question mark after Gragnano." 
</P>
<P>
9. EL TORO 
</P>
<P>
Four starters who combined to win 15 games give El Toro one of the best 
pitching staffs in the county. Rob Johnson won eight games; Brad Hulse won 
three games, and Greg Pearce and Ryan Filbeck each won two games last season. 
</P>
<P>
"Pitching should keep us in all games . . . hopefully the experience will pay 
off," El Toro Coach Dan DeLeon said. 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Bo Haley, a three-year starter, is a Division I prospect and among 
the county's best players. Shortstop Chris Sauritch and third baseman Scott 
Sebbo both have good power. 
</P>
<P>
10. EL DORADO 
</P>
<P>
It is supposed to be a rebuilding for El Dorado, which won the Southern Section 
5-A division title last year. Every starter graduated from last year's team 
that finished 23-8, but Coach Steve Gullotti has a good group of sophomores and 
juniors who were the nucleus of the junior varsity team that finished 19-6 last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Andy Brazeel has won four games going into Friday's league opener with 
Esperanza. El Dorado had no problems scoring runs in the Loara tournament last 
week, getting 11 runs in the first inning in a 16-2 victory over Savanna. 
</P>
<P>
"We should be strong defensively and have more-than-adequate offense," Gullotti 
said. "We will need two or three pitchers to emerge if we expect to win." 
</P>
<P>
Others teams to watch: Anaheim, Capistrano Valley, Esperanza, Estancia, 
Fountain Valley, Mission Viejo, Pacifica, Santa Ana, Sunny Hills and Trabuco 
Hills.

PREP BASEBALL: FORMER MATER DEI PLAYER HAS TO SIT OUT SENIOR YEAR AFTER SECOND 
BOUT OF MONONUCLEOSIS. HE'S HOPING TO RESUME ATHLETIC CAREER AT LOYOLA

<TEXT>
<P>
Greg Carl, one of the top high school baseball players in Orange County, 
transferred from Mater Dei High School before this season, but he won't be 
playing for his new school. 
</P>
<P>
Carl, a third-team all-Southern Section and a first-team selection on The 
Times' All-County list last year as a junior, left Mater Dei in January after 
doctors told him he needed rest to recover from his second bout of 
mononucleosis in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Carl is working in a home-study curriculum administered by Horizon High, a 
school run by the Orange County Department of Education that offers no athletic 
program. The curriculum does offer Carl the chance to get his high school 
diploma and maintain the hope that he will be able to attend Loyola Marymount 
on a baseball scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
As the Monarchs' leadoff batter last year, Carl stole a school-record 20 bases 
and batted nearly .500. But in the last few regular-season games and during the 
Monarchs' three games in the Southern Section playoffs, Carl didn't steal any 
bases. No one realized it at the time but his unusual lack of base-running 
aggressiveness was an indication that he was running out of steam. 
</P>
<P>
The week after Mater Dei lost to eventual champion El Dorado in the 
quarterfinals of the Division 5-A playoffs, Carl was diagnosed as having 
mononucleosis. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to miss the leadership he would have given," Mater Dei Coach Bob 
Ickes said. "We're going to miss the work ethic he had." 
</P>
<P>
Carl's work ethic may have been just the thing that has put him in his current 
situation. He said he kept himself awake nights last season thinking about the 
game the next day. "With his hard work and everything, it just wore him down 
and his body couldn't take it," Ickes said. "It just pushed him too far past 
the point, and I think it just wore him down physically and mentally." 
</P>
<P>
In June, doctors told Carl he contracted the disease early in the season. But 
he said it only affected him during the last few regular-season games and the 
three playoff games. Until he started to really feel sick, Carl said he was too 
excited about the season to notice his illness. "When you start playing 
baseball your adrenaline goes so you don't feel it during the game," he said. 
"You don't feel it before the game, you don't feel it after the game, you feel 
it when you wake up in the morning, the first part of the day and really late 
at night (when) you wake up and you can't sleep." 
</P>
<P>
Heeding his doctor's advice, Carl didn't play baseball in the summer. There 
were weeks when he was so weak he couldn't get out of bed. 
</P>
<P>
In the fall, he started training with the baseball team at Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
"I got right into baseball after the summer," Carl said. "I did everything else 
I was supposed to do, ran hard, worked hard and all this stuff, and it was just 
too early." 
</P>
<P>
"(Coach Ickes would) always tell me to take it easy but you know you can't do 
that," Carl said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Carl's efforts, Ickes said, he wasn't the athlete he used to be. Where 
he used to lead the Monarchs' training runs, he now struggled to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
"You could tell he didn't have the strength he had in the past," Ickes said. 
</P>
<P>
The baseball games he played for a scout team affiliated with the San Francisco 
Giants also took their toll and eventually Carl ran himself down again. "We'd 
play at night and it would be wet," he said. "I think the first time I got sick 
we didn't think anything of it, but then I kept getting sick every week." 
</P>
<P>
In January, doctors told Carl he had mononucleosis again. The virus that causes 
the disease, they told him, can stay in a body for six or seven months and 
because he wore himself down, his resistance was low. The prescription was 
rest, away from the demands of athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Carl's medical problems, Loyola Marymount Coach Chris Smith still wants 
to offer a scholarship to Carl if he can meet the school's admission standards. 
Smith said he doesn't care that Carl can't play his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so disappointing (for Carl)," Smith said. "The only thing I've tried to 
make him understand is, 'Hey, your life's not over because you miss one high 
school season.' The best thing he can do is get healthy. This doesn't mean he's 
not going to be a great baseball player." 
</P>
<P>
However, Smith said, he has some questions about the manner in which Carl 
became ill. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe he needs to rest some," Smith said. "He's got an awful lot of energy, 
maybe he needs to back off a bit." 
</P>
<P>
Carl, 17, is trying to relax. He says he will not repeat his mistakes, 
promising to get enough sleep and eat proper meals. Thursday, he will have his 
tonsils removed, which should relieve the sore throats that have plagued him. 
</P>
<P>
Although he feels weak because he has been inactive since late December, Carl 
is ready to start getting in shape. After he was found to be free of the virus 
that causes mononucleosis last week, Carl was cleared to exercise. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is not rushing to get in shape as he did in the fall. This time, he 
is leisurely hitting off a tee and throwing himself ground balls in his back 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm taking it slow, real slow," Carl said. 
</P>
<P>
Until doctors give him clearance to play, Carl is keeping occupied by working 
on his truck and talking to the mechanics at a local automotive shop. He also 
helps his mother with the household chores and works two to three hours a day 
on his school work. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have to sit home and do nothing, it's no fun," Carl said. "It's hard 
because you know your buddies are out there practicing, hitting, fielding 
ground balls, laughing and having fun, and you're not. 
</P>
<P>
"But you learn to handle it, I guess. What else can you do?"

ESTANCIA'S LY DISCOVERS RIGHT SPORT TO BE A STAR; 
</P>
<P>
BADMINTON: SENIOR DISCARDED BASKETBALL. NOW HE'S HOPING FOR A RETURN TO 
SOUTHERN SECTION FINAL. 
</P>

<P>
Estancia High School badminton Coach Lillian Brabander must cringe when 
imagining Hoang Ly with a soft jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
If Ly was dangerous from the outside or had fancy moves inside, he might have 
starred on the Eagles' basketball team. Instead, he gave up basketball after 
starting on the junior varsity team as a sophomore to concentrate on badminton. 
</P>
<P>
It was a wise choice, said Brabander. 
</P>
<P>
"This kid was born with badminton skills," she said. "He's the Magic Johnson of 
badminton. He does everything wonderfully. He has mental and physical gifts." 
</P>
<P>
Ly, a senior, used those gifts well last season. He was 65-1 -- losing only in 
the Southern Section singles final -- won five tournaments and was named The 
Times' Orange County player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The appearance in the final, where he lost to Alta Loma's Dan Mussman in three 
games, capped a year filled with accomplishments for Ly. He also placed third 
in the U.S. Junior Nationals and won the Southern California Junior Nationals. 
</P>
<P>
Ly, who opened his senior season by winning the singles title at a tournament 
at Garden Grove March 2, is ranked second nationally in the junior division by 
the U.S. Badminton Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Ly, 19, has only three years of playing experience. But he realized the first 
time he held a racquet that the sport felt right. 
</P>
<P>
"For most beginners, you have to teach them how to hold a racquet, but when I 
first tried I already knew how to hold it," he said. "Some players can't hit 
the bird when they first start out, but I could hit it hard when I started. I'm 
a natural, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
Brabander, who has coached badminton at Estancia since 1967, said she has never 
seen a player develop as quickly as Ly. 
</P>
<P>
"Wow, was he ever a natural," she said. "He has the eye. That bird travels 
faster than any other object in sports. Your eye needs to be able to see it 
coming, see where you should place it and then make the connection. You can't 
coach what this kid's got." 
</P>
<P>
However, Ly said he still is learning the sport's finer points. Despite last 
season's impressive record, he was unhappy with his serve and bothered by 
inconsistent play. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year my strength was smashing," he said. "I think my offense and defense 
are balanced now. This year, I have everything." 
</P>
<P>
One thing eludes Ly: a Southern Section singles championship. 
</P>
<P>
The loss to Mussman last season, 15-12, 14-17, 18-16, was Ly's second 
consecutive defeat in the final. As a sophomore, he lost to Diamond Bar's Marc 
Carrido, 15-8, 18-15. Ly has a chance to avenge the loss to Mussman during a 
tournament March 23 at Estancia. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to beat him this time," said Ly, who won a Southern Section mixed 
doubles championship last season. "I'm definitely looking forward to it." 
</P>
<P>
Ly, who will compete in the 1990 junior nationals in June, is considering 
attending Arizona State, which Brabander said has the top badminton program in 
the country. Ly, however, would rather stay closer to his family and is leaning 
toward going to Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Ly's greatest goal, though, is making the U.S. Olympic team. Badminton, a 
demonstration sport in 1988, will be a medal sport for the first time at the 
1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my goal right now, to make the Olympics," he said.

R. H. Macy &amp; Co., one of the nation's best-known retailers, Tuesday blamed 
a weak Christmas season and its competitors as it reported a $39-million loss 
for its second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
New York-based Macy, which owns the Bullock's and I. Magnin stores in Southern 
California, said the loss resulted from "turmoil" during the holidays created 
by competitors who discounted aggressively. The retailer was taken private in a 
1986 leveraged buyout. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. department store chains operated by Campeau Corp. of Canada -- 
including Bloomingdale's, Jordan Marsh and other stores -- cut prices heavily 
over the holidays to raise cash to pay their debts. They filed for bankruptcy 
protection in January. 
</P>
<P>
Macy's loss for the fiscal quarter ended Jan. 27 contrasted with a profit of 
$72.6 million in the year-ago period, the company's quarterly financial 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
While Macy had reported that a loss for the quarter was likely, the decline's 
magnitude surprised some industry analysts. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to investors, Macy said its strategy had been to protect its share 
of the market and pare inventories. The strategy worked, Macy said, as sales 
rose 7.2% to $2.44 billion in the quarter. Sales at stores open longer than one 
year rose 5.4%. But the increases came at the expense of profits. 
</P>
<P>
"As expected, margins were severely affected by unusually heavy promotions, but 
we believe this was an atypical time," Chairman Edward Finkelstein said in the 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
The nine Campeau store chains resorted to heavy price-cutting to raise cash to 
meet interest and other payments on the large debts incurred when they were 
acquired by Campeau. But the strategy was not successful, and the retail chains 
were plunged into bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Macy's losses "reflect the effects of the well-publicized turmoil in the retail 
industry, especially during the important holiday season," its quarterly report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"In selected key markets, several competitors, which were experiencing 
cash-flow problems, initiated significant price-cutting activity during this 
quarter," it said. 
</P>
<P>
Macy had warned bankers, investors and suppliers that it expected a loss for 
the period. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew they were not doing well, but the extent of the negative numbers really 
surprised me," said Kurt Barnard, publisher of the Barnard's Marketing Report, 
an industry newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth consecutive quarterly loss for the retailer and one of its 
biggest. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the weak performance, the company said that its financial structure is 
sound and that it will have enough cash to meet obligations. 
</P>
<P>
The company's long- and short-term debt totals $5.61 billion, Macy said. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the debt was incurred when Finkelstein and Mark Handler, Macy's 
president, led a group of about 400 management associates who took the company 
private in July, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
For the six months, Macy reported a loss of $72.2 million, contrasted with a 
profit of $53.6 million in the year-ago period. Sales rose 6.4% to $4.15 
billion.

American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. said Tuesday that it would market and 
develop some of Tandem Computers Inc.'s Unix-based products in an alliance that 
may entrench the Unix operating system as a market leader for fault-tolerant 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
The long-distance telephone giant said it has acquired the rights to develop 
and market worldwide Tandem's Unix System V-based computer products and 
technology in an effort to accelerate the availability and acceptance of System 
V software. 
</P>
<P>
"This agreement combines AT&amp;T's strength in open systems and networking 
with Tandem's leadership in fault tolerant platforms," Richard McGinn, 
president of AT&amp;T Computer Systems, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Fault tolerant computers are used when constant operation is required and a 
second system is used to back up the primary system. Analysts estimate the 
market for fault tolerant computers at about $1.8 billion.

CPC PLANS TO BUY HOSPITAL, HEALTH FIRM; 
</P>
<P>
ACQUISITIONS: COMPANY ALSO ANNOUNCES THAT ADMISSIONS AT TWO OF ITS FACILITIES 
DECLINED 2% IN FIRST QUARTER.

<P>
Community Psychiatric Centers said Tuesday that it has tentatively agreed to 
buy Brea Neuropsychiatric Hospital and a West German mental health management 
company, and also disclosed that admissions at its hospitals dipped slightly in 
its first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of both proposed acquisitions were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
The news concerning the nearly 2% decline in hospital admissions prompted a 
4.7% decline in the Laguna Hills-based company's stock amid unusually heavy 
trading, analysts said. CPC's stock fell $1.125 to close Tuesday at a 52-week 
low of $21.875 per share, with 1.2 million shares changing hands. 
</P>
<P>
"I think CPC is the best-managed company in the hospital services industry. 
They have a proven record of over 20 years of posting improved earnings," said 
Peter Sidoti, an analyst with the investment banking firm of County NatWest in 
New York. "The question now is whether they will be able to keep it up. It's my 
belief they will have a tough time." 
</P>
<P>
CPC Chairman James Conte vehemently disagreed Tuesday, saying the company is 
successfully fending off such industrywide problems as increasing competition 
and a crackdown by insurers on costs, particularly those attached to mental 
health. CPC is additionally facing a decline in admissions in adolescent drug 
treatment programs because of a recent spate of negative publicity surrounding 
such programs at other companies. 
</P>
<P>
He said CPC recently raised its rates approximately 8% and is predicting 
another year of improved earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond a slight industry downturn, Conte blamed the admissions decline at CPC 
on an increase in the number of hospitals and a slowdown in specific markets. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in admissions at CPC's established hospitals -- those open for 
more than a year -- has been declining for nearly a year. The growth in 
admissions has fallen from a high of 16.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 1989 
to a 1.8% decline in fiscal 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Conte said Tuesday that he expects the acquisition of Harvard Medical Services 
to offset the decline in new patients at existing hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
The Frankfurt, West Germany, firm contracts with U.S. armed forces and 
corporations in Western Europe as a psychiatric referral service. The company 
arranges psychiatric care in the United States for individuals returning home 
because of illness. 
</P>
<P>
CPC expects to pick up 90% of Harvard's referrals, which would increase 
admissions. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Comprehensive Care Corp., the ailing alcohol- and drug-treatment 
company formerly headquartered in Irvine, has agreed to sell to CPC its newly 
constructed 152-bed Brea Neuropsychiatric Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Conte said he would install CPC management there and probably change the 
hospital's name. 
</P>
<P>
Some former administrators at Brea Neuropsychiatric have alleged in lawsuits 
filed against Comp Care that deep budget cuts had ravaged patient care there. 
The suits -- filed within the last three years -- claimed that cost-cutting was 
responsible for one unattended patient's death from a drug overdose, an 
attempted suicide and a homosexual gang rape of a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
Comp Care has denied all of the charges in the past and defended the quality of 
patient care provided at the Brea facility. 
</P>
<P>

admissions at established Community Psychiatric Centers in relation to the 
comparable year-ago period.

WOMEN: MORE LESBIAN COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE ACKNOWLEDGING THEIR SEXUAL IDENTITY. 
AS A RESULT, THEY'RE TAKING A HIGHER PROFILE.

Stephanie Thomas was such a fervently religious child that she proselytized for 
her church as a junior high school student in Palos Verdes. She continued her 
efforts during high school and converted her own mother and sisters to the 
"born-again" Christian faith she had chosen. 
</P>
<P>
But during her first semester at a Christian college, Azusa Pacific University, 
Thomas found herself attracted to a young woman in her freshman class. 
</P>
<P>
"We freaked out," Thomas says of the day they realized their friendship was 
more than intellectual. 
</P>
<P>
"We said, 'Never again,' because it's wrong in God's eyes. . . . We dated men 
and promised each other that if we could find a man we'd stay with him because 
we wanted to be accepted by society and by our families, and we wanted an 
easier life than the one we'd have" as lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
For a year Thomas was counseled by a "born-again" group therapist at the 
university. "She was terrific, but she couldn't help me figure out why I was 
the way I was." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas says she finally realized she could not change her sexual identity -- so 
she "denounced" her religion and changed her school. 
</P>
<P>
Now 22 and a senior at UCLA, she is co-president of the 2-year-old, 25-member 
lesbian sorority, Lambda Delta Lambda, which has new sister chapters at San 
Francisco State University and UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas has access to weekly lesbian rap groups on campus and a psychotherapy 
group led by a lesbian for lesbians, initiated last month by the school's 
Student Psychological Services department. She can enroll in such classes as 
"Psychology of the Lesbian Experience," "Architecture and Urban Planning for 
Gay and Lesbian Communities" and lesbian literature. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas feels "comfortable" at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
She is not alone. More and more lesbians attending colleges and universities 
nationwide are acknowledging their sexual identity. Their increasingly high 
profile has led to more lesbian student organizations and counseling 
activities, and more awareness of their presence on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Even some religious schools are part of the trend. Last month, officials at 
Loyola Marymount, a Roman Catholic university, bowed to student protests and 
permitted the Alliance of Gays and Lesbians, a student club, to meet on campus 
and use school facilities. (Clubs that combine gay men and lesbians are 
becoming passe at some schools where lesbians have broken away to create 
organizations of their own.) 
</P>
<P>
School administrators and educators emphasize that the number of lesbian 
students has not changed over the years. About 10% of the general population is 
homosexual, and that figure remains constant both on and off campus, they say. 
</P>
<P>
What has changed dramatically is that more lesbians now publicly announce their 
sexual identity -- and they do so at a much earlier age. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Williams, an associate professor of anthropology at USC who teaches a 
course on "Gender and Sexuality as an Issue in American Public Life," says 
young people are "identifying themselves as lesbians and gays much earlier in 
their lives than was previously true." 
</P>
<P>
Eloise Klein Healy, assistant professor and coordinator of women's studies at 
California State University, Northridge, says young women now "decide at an 
earlier age not to be in the closet" because "ground was cleared by courageous 
people who came before and created space they could come out into. These kids 
have 20 years behind them of the gay and lesbian movement . . . and 20 years of 
feminism. Put those things together and it looks to them like there are more 
options now." 
</P>
<P>
Healy says it is not unusual for women at CSUN to identify themselves as 
lesbians in classroom discussions. "They'll stand up and say, 'I am a lesbian' 
and go on to explain the issue from the lesbian point of view." 
</P>
<P>
At UC Berkeley, "there are lots of groups and forums where lesbians can 
identify themselves in a way not possible a few years ago," says Arlene Stein, 
a doctoral candidate and author of an upcoming book on emerging trends in 
lesbian culture. She points out that lesbians "have begun to mainstream" and 
become part of more traditional institutions, such as sororities and family 
units of their own. Last year "two lesbians ran as lesbians for Student Union 
office -- and one of them won." 
</P>
<P>
At USC, there is a lesbian support group in addition to the Gay and Lesbian 
Student Union, Gay and Lesbian Assembly for Student Support (GLASS) and Gay and 
Lesbian Law Union. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1989, City College of San Francisco opened a Department of Gay and 
Lesbian Studies. Jack Collins, chairman of the department, says there is "a 
flourishing of lesbian communities on campuses nationwide. Gay men went through 
this in the 1970s, and now the lesbians are acting in congruent ways in the 
late '80s and early '90s. They're more proud, less scared." 
</P>
<P>
Collins says "women worked very hard in the '70s to set up women's study 
programs and lesbian studies programs that are just now starting to be seen 
around the country." 
</P>
<P>
Patrick C. Snee, a Brown University junior and member of the school's 
Lesbian/Gay Student Assn. has felt the impact of increasing lesbian pride at 
the Providence, R.I., campus. He says the LGSA was run by gays until about a 
year ago, when lesbians started to exert their influence. At UCLA, the 
TenPercent magazine for lesbians and gays had a male editor for the first eight 
years. The first female editor was named two years ago, and a second was 
appointed last year. 
</P>
<P>
Brown is one of many universities that has a Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual Student 
Awareness week each year. In addition, the university's associate director of 
student activities, Kristen Renn, was named in February as the school's first 
"official liaison" to the lesbian/gay/bisexual student community. 
</P>
<P>
Renn, 25, says she is a lesbian and may therefore have a better understanding 
of the students' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
A new support group called SORT (Sexual Orientation Reflection Time) was 
initiated by Brown last month "for students in the process of coming out," says 
school spokesman Toby Simon. 
</P>
<P>
"We're at the beginning of a period of really rapid expansion" in acceptance, 
says Loralee MacPike, associate dean of humanities and professor of English at 
California State University, San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
MacPike ought to know. In October, 1988, on "National Coming Out Day," she took 
microphone in hand and told 250 students in her "Perspectives on Gender" class 
that she is a lesbian. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who thought they knew no gays or lesbians found out differently," she 
says. "They had to alter their prejudices because they had to deal with me for 
the rest of the quarter." She "felt much better" after she told them, she adds. 
Ultimately, when there are enough such revelations, MacPike believes "a kind of 
normalization will take place" and the word lesbian "won't frighten people." 
</P>
<P>
When MacPike attended Bryn Mawr College in Bryn Mawr. Pa., in the 1960s, she 
recalls, nobody would have used the word lesbian in polite conversation. "We 
didn't think of ourselves that way because we didn't have that category. But we 
have now achieved a critical mass. That is, when you get to a certain point in 
thinking about anything, and enough people think about it, it comes into 
existence." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the increase in lesbian activism at Bryn Mawr College, Debra Thomas 
laughs and says she's wearing a button that reads "Another Straight for Gay 
Rights." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, director of public information for the women's undergraduate division, 
says "pluralism workshops" to help increase tolerance on campus were started 
two years ago along with sexuality workshops, one of which is specifically for 
lesbians. It teaches "how to be comfortable with your sexual identity after 
you've identified yourself as a lesbian," Thomas says. 
</P>
<P>
Sexuality workshops were only for heterosexual students at first, she explains, 
"but we began hearing we needed to do more for homosexual students, and we 
wanted to help them all. 
</P>
<P>
"What's increasing dramatically on campus is (sexual) experimentation," she 
adds. "I'm not just talking about homosexual experimentation, but 
experimentation across the board." 
</P>
<P>
At Yale University in New Haven, Conn., as at other campuses around the 
country, observers notice a growing interest in bisexuality. 
</P>
<P>
"We get our biggest attendance at meetings where we discuss bisexuality," says 
the 20-year-old head of Yalesbians, one of the school's registered, student-run 
lesbian groups. 
</P>
<P>
She does not want her name used because, like most students interviewed for 
this article, she says "everybody knows I'm a lesbian except my parents. I love 
them and wouldn't want to hurt them." 
</P>
<P>
For her, as for most "out" lesbians -- those who have publicly acknowledged 
their sexual identity -- there is a big difference between the atmosphere of 
school and the real world. 
</P>
<P>
Even at Yale, she says, many students are homophobic. "But there is a sizable 
lesbian population on this campus, and there are enough (lesbian-oriented) 
groups and counseling facilities so that all you have to do is find the right 
group and show up." There are also acknowledged lesbian and gay professors at 
the school, she says. She is "comfortable" about being "out. If I have my arm 
around my girlfriend while I'm walking, it's OK on this campus." In the outside 
world, she realizes, it's usually not. 
</P>
<P>
Abigail Van Buren -- Dear Abby -- says she has started to receive letters from 
parents of lesbians. In a Feb. 28 column published in The Times, a mother 
complained that she "lost her only daughter" at a college "nicknamed Lesbian U 
because so many girls become bonded to each other there" and warned parents to 
"check out" schools before they let their children go. Abby recommended the 
mother attend a support group called Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents are the only people close to me who do not know," says a lesbian 
student at USC. "They are traditional people and I see no reason to hurt them." 
</P>
<P>
Her words are repeated, with slight variations, from campus to campus. 
</P>
<P>
One lesbian activist at UCLA doesn't want her name used even though her parents 
do know. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a very 'out' lesbian in every aspect of my life -- except at my job." She 
needs her part-time job to save for graduate school tuition and is positive 
she'd be fired if her employers knew. "They've made some pretty crude jokes 
about homosexuality. They'd find some reason to dismiss me." 
</P>
<P>
She was surprised at her parents' reaction when she told them. "I was nervous, 
so my mom said, 'Take a deep breath and say what you have to say.' I took a 
deep breath, closed my eyes and said, 'Mom, I'm a lesbian.' She said, 'Honey, I 
knew that all along.' " 
</P>
<P>
Many students aren't that lucky. One woman, who does not want her real name or 
university mentioned, said a younger sister saw her kissing a girlfriend during 
a visit to campus. The sister told her parents, who were "disappointed and 
horrified." They told their older daughter they would stop paying her school 
bills unless she "got help" from a psychiatrist of their choice; they chose a 
psychiatrist who told them he does not consider lesbianism to be "normal." They 
told her that if her lesbianism becomes known, her father's business might go 
downhill and her younger sister's reputation might be ruined. 
</P>
<P>
Her mother also said she "could never trust her again." 
</P>
<P>
It is a burden that many lesbian students say they bear. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, most lesbians interviewed for this article believe they'll 
be able to lead happy, productive, open lives after college. Says one, "It's a 
brand-new world, and women can be achievers whether they are lesbian or 
straight."

FAILED DRUG WAR?; 
</P>
<P>
BOOKS: FORMER UNDERCOVER AGENT MIKE LEVINE ACCUSES DEA OF MISMANAGEMENT, 
RISKING LIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHERINE STEPHEN, Stephen, a Washington-based free-lancer, writes often for 
View. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For 25 years, Michael Levine, a former star undercover agent for the federal 
Drug Enforcement Administration, avoided recognition because his life depended 
on it. 
</P>
<P>
The wrong use of a slang term or a flicker of a tense eyebrow would have been 
enough to blow his cover and get him killed on a Harlem street or in the 
tropical heat of Panama, where he operated in disguise to bring drug criminals 
to justice. 
</P>
<P>
But now, Levine, 50, is seeking exposure. 
</P>
<P>
He is doing so despite, he says, personal risk, because he thinks the DEA has 
an enemy greater and more destructive than any drug dealer he's come across: 
The enemy within. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, says streetwise, tough-talking Levine, is "the suits." 
</P>
<P>
Suits -- that's Levine's slang for those who hold bureaucratic and management 
positions at DEA. They are people who have no firsthand experience in the drug 
war and are unwilling to listen to the agents who do, he says. The cost of that 
has been agents' lives and the failure to solve the drug problem, he claims. 
</P>
<P>
He has documented his criticism in "Deep Cover: The Inside Story of How DEA 
In-Fighting, Incompetence and Subterfuge Lost Us the Biggest Battle of the Drug 
War" (Delacorte Press), which has appeared on the New York Times best-seller 
list. 
</P>
<P>
The book is dedicated to Enrique (Kiki) Camarena, the DEA agent fatally 
tortured in Mexico in 1985 after his memos describing the danger he faced were 
ignored by DEA management. His tragedy received national media attention when 
he was murdered and recently was the subject of the NBC miniseries "Drug 
Lords." 
</P>
<P>
Levine, however, alleges that there has been no proper investigation as to why 
Camarena's death was allowed to happen. 
</P>
<P>
"The people in charge were made to look like heroes in the miniseries," Levine 
says. "Actually, nothing has changed as a result of Camarena's death. 
</P>
<P>
"I really believe that Enrique Camarena would have written this book had he 
lived," says Levine. "I know that by writing a book like this I will be 
tempting some dangerous forces. I'm more frightened of the suits than I've ever 
been of drug dealers." 
</P>
<P>
It's not as though Michael Levine is easy to scare. 
</P>
<P>
The subject of a 1988 biography, "Undercover" by Donald Goddard, Levine's life 
reads like a major motion picture waiting to happen. Widely acknowledged as 
being one of the DEA's most effective undercover agents, Levine risked his life 
countless times as a consummate actor who infiltrated the world of drug 
traffickers at all points on the criminal spectrum -- from desperate small-time 
Harlem dealers to the sophisticated South American businessmen who run the drug 
trade. Over a quarter of a century, Levine is credited with putting more than 
3,000 criminals behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
Now a self-described whistle-blower, Levine is turning the energies he once 
reserved for catching criminals against his former bosses. 
</P>
<P>
Although agents working for the DEA are discouraged from speaking to the media, 
Levine is able to speak out now because he retired from the agency in 1989, 
after being injured while on a New York drug raid. 
</P>
<P>
The drug war, he asserts in his book, is a sham, designed to "mislead and 
manipulate the American public. The sad truth is that our drug war is driven by 
political forces, bureaucratic rivalries, inept management, corruption and 
deceit." 
</P>
<P>
Discussing Operation Snowcap, an American quasi-military effort to stop the 
flow of cocaine at sources in South America, he says it has done nothing to 
stem the drug tide. Instead, he cited recent newspaper reports stating that 
coca production has increased 12% among the four coca-producing nations: Peru, 
Colombia, Bolivia and Ecuador. While undercover, Levine says, he has heard 
Bolivian traffickers laugh at U.S. drug-fighting efforts. 
</P>
<P>
In "Deep Cover," Levine details his own experiences with what he calls DEA's 
"inept" management. His book describes the treatment he says he received in 
Operation Trifecta, a drug investigation Levine terms "the biggest and most 
bizarre undercover case in the history of law enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
The operation, as he describes it, was "a plan that could have smashed the top 
drug violators in (Panama, Bolivia and Mexico) with one blow." He says it could 
have produced the "first really damaging blow to the cartel in drug war 
history." 
</P>
<P>
It began with the arrest of a small-time dealer who turned informant. In 
September, 1987, the investigation gathered steam when it became apparent that 
the informant could lead DEA officials, including Levine, to some of South 
America's most powerful drug lords. 
</P>
<P>
Five months later, Operation Trifecta ended with the arrest and trial of seven 
major South American drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
But, Levine asserts, the operation could have accomplished much more, such as 
providing some of the first significant DEA intelligence about La Corporacion 
-- the Mafia-style organization that is the drug world's ultimate power. 
</P>
<P>
"The suits" at DEA, however, did not come through with the backup he and his 
fellow agents needed on the case, says Levine, who accuses: 
</P>
<P>
* The U.S. Customs Service, which worked with the DEA on the case, of treating 
the informant who triggered Operation Trifecta in an excessively generous and 
possibly illegal fashion. 
</P>
<P>
* DEA managers of risking his and other agents' lives by refusing to provide a 
safe undercover house in Panama where they could trap major drug dealers in 
bogus transactions; DEA managers instead insisted on using the Panama City 
Marriott, a place where the Bolivians knew DEA agents stayed, he says. 
</P>
<P>
* DEA of being too cheap to supply agents with the money to front a $5-million, 
1,000-kilo cocaine buy; the lure of $5 million, he asserts, would have brought 
"high Mexican officials" running to Panama for face-to-face negotiations, which 
would have provided vital intelligence and significant arrests. 
</P>
<P>
* DEA of botching investigations in Mexico and San Diego, resulting, he says, 
in top Mexican officials escaping arrest. 
</P>
<P>
* DEA and Customs of failing to coordinate their work, leading to interagency 
conflicts that pitted agents against each other, risking lives. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Shults, DEA chief of public affairs, declined to comment in detail on 
Levine's allegations: "We're not going to get into a debate with Mike Levine or 
with anyone else about the specifics of the book, because we're not going to 
distract ourselves from (our) mission." 
</P>
<P>
Shults said "a private citizen" may write anything he wants, but added of 
Levine: "It's unfortunate that he chooses to take on all of the former 
colleagues, or unfortunate that he chooses to take on this agency." 
</P>
<P>
For Levine, this time of going public is an uneasy one. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't do what I've done for 25 years and be real happy about it," he 
admits. "It's really nerve-racking." 
</P>
<P>
He says he is not the only agent dissatisfied with the results of Operation 
Trifecta. He says his partner, Customs agent Jorge (George) Urquijo, backs his 
criticisms and fears the consequences of Levine's decision to speak out. 
</P>
<P>
"The prevailing feeling in DEA," Levine explains, "is of a great lack of 
respect for its own leadership. Look at Camarena. He writes memo after memo 
saying, 'This is crazy. We're going to die.' And no one listens to him. So who 
is his real enemy?" 
</P>
<P>
Levine is a formidable man, someone not to be encountered from the wrong side 
of an interrogation table. He is more than 6 feet tall and is a karate black 
belt for whom working out is almost as much a way of life as a hobby. A former 
semiprofessional actor, he has mysteriously plastic features, which he says 
take easily to disguise. 
</P>
<P>
Levine is adept at camouflage and with street life, because he learned about it 
growing up in the South Bronx. His late father was a loan shark who married six 
times, he says. His younger brother was a heroin addict who committed suicide 
as a result of his addiction. Levine says his brother's death has been a major 
motivating factor in his undercover work. 
</P>
<P>
Possibly to compensate for the chaos he grew up in, Levine is a perfectionist 
in his professional life. He does not suffer gladly people who make mistakes or 
who are less dedicated than he has been in his career, which has taken him on 
investigations in Thailand and the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Levine, who blames his work dedication for a failed marriage, entered law 
enforcement with the Internal Revenue Service intelligence division after a 
turbulent stint in the Air Force. Seeking more action, he left the IRS for an 
assignment with the Treasury Department's Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Bureau. 
In 1966, he went undercover as a motorcycle gang member, work that led to a 
record bomb seizure. 
</P>
<P>
Levine later joined the then-new DEA, going undercover to crack a case against 
corrupt agents who sold to criminals the names of fellow agents. The case led 
the DEA, which later put Levine in its classrooms as an instructor on 
undercover techniques, to restructure its internal security. 
</P>
<P>
Levine says he has come face to face with a humbling truth -- that his and 
other agents' personal courage and efforts have not won the drug war. 
</P>
<P>
"After I recognized the futility and ridiculousness of the drug war -- how 
undercovers aren't going to win it -- I made it my personal mission in teaching 
undercover that, whatever you do, it's not worth your life," he says. 
</P>
<P>
He says that the one way to win the drug war is to concentrate on mandatory 
treatment programs for drug users. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than force addicts to go into drug programs, we'd rather invade 
Panama," Levine says. 
</P>
<P>
He counters charges that he is merely a frustrated agent by noting that he 
received a management job when he became DEA's top official in Argentina and 
Uruguay from 1978 to 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, his love is undercover work, he says. "It's as addictive as the drugs 
that run it. The better I got at it, the more exotic the fantasy the government 
would pay for." 
</P>
<P>
Thus was born Levine's most spectacular role: Luis, the bejeweled Mafia front 
man of Operation Trifecta. He acted that part to the hilt, he says in his book: 
"I made my grand entrance as Luis Garcia-Lopez, dressed in solid white from 
head to foot with diamonds and gold on my hands, wrists, and around my neck." 
</P>
<P>
Wearing sunglasses -- even indoors -- Levine negotiated in the fluent 
colloquial Spanish he learned from his Puerto Rican girlfriend in the South 
Bronx. In a videotape, Levine, in disguise as Luis, appears totally at ease 
with three South Americans, as hidden colleagues record the proceedings. "I'm 
loving every minute of it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Levine is retired, he says he has only to worry about the enemies he's 
made with his book. He plans to concentrate on a writing career and has 
completed drafts of two novels. 
</P>
<P>
But he seems to know it can be complicated for an action man to start thinking 
too much: His world of Good Guys vs. Bad Guys has already changed into a 
frightening morass where the villains, for now, wear gray suits.

FASHION: SHORT WAS THE WATCHWORD AT THE LONDON SHOWS. MANY DESIGNERS FEATURED 
BRIGHTLY COLORED, KNEE-SKIMMING OR SHORTER SKIRTS, SUCH AS THIS ONE FROM JEAN 
MUIR.

LONDON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest news so far from the fall, 1990, collections is the shadow 
they have thrown on the future of the traditional runway fashion show. 
</P>
<P>
Take designer Franco Moschino's show last week in Milan. In Moschino's 
presentation, members of a ballet troupe wearing flesh-colored leotards tossed 
a jumble of clothes -- which turned out to be the designer's new collection -- 
onto the stage, then fished out various items, slipped them over the leotards 
and danced down the runway to French cancan music. 
</P>
<P>
Then, over the weekend in London, two of the city's most talked about talents, 
Rifat Ozbek and Jasper Conran, eschewed a show for an alternative form of 
fashion theater. Obviously, there's a trend in the making. 
</P>
<P>
Conran's method, like Moschino's, was haphazard. He pulled together a selection 
from the new collection, hung it on a rack and asked friends to pick out 
something and wear it to a packed party he gave in his Great Malborough Street 
design studio. 
</P>
<P>
Even Conran was surprised at the ensuing results. "When I made my selection," 
he said, "I was sure I knew who was going to pick which outfit to wear. Not one 
friend chose the outfit I had selected mentally for her." 
</P>
<P>
Fun, maybe, but confusing for buyers (among American stores represented in 
London were Bergdorf Goodman, Barney's, Charivari, Maxfield, Macy's California 
and I. Magnin), who were not aware that Conran's new collection was milling 
about in the mob. Most had to go back for a second look, this time shown on a 
video that starred Royal Ballet dancer Darcy Russell. The background music 
quickly became the weekend's signature: "I've Got the Power," by Soul to Soul. 
</P>
<P>
But the weekend's most spectacular event was Ozbek's video, "Millennium," 
directed by John Maybury, considered England's hippest young film maker. The 
Turkish-born designer, whose fans range from Madonna to the Princess of Wales, 
claims he chose this video presentation over a live show because it was easier 
to control the image he wanted to project. 
</P>
<P>
With shops all over London filled with interpretations of his all-white "New 
Age" collection from last season, Ozbek's fall line stunned viewers with a 
blast of brilliant color. Models drifted and floated across the screen against 
a shifting field of kaleidoscopic images. 
</P>
<P>
The video was shown by appointment on a gigantic screen at Westway Studio with 
the clothes conveniently at hand in an adjoining studio. 
</P>
<P>
Another new wrinkle in the London scene is one that riles many in the English 
fashion community: Designers John Galliano and Katharine Hamnett will present 
their collections in Paris, not London. Hamnett's defection deprived the scene 
of what was usually the maddest bash of London Fashion Week, although her 
protege, Nick Coleman, will continue to show in town. Coleman also runs 
BSolaris, a nightclub where the young fashion crowd gathers, as Coleman says: 
"to sweat" and listen to jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Muir presented her collection against a background of jazz. Colors were 
primarily gray and black for a collection with a '30s feel -- cape collars were 
a theme, as were little shaped jackets. Skirts were knee-baring but demure. 
Muir's long, cashmere cardigans formed abstract prints in warm colors. She 
showed them over short, knit skimmer dresses. 
</P>
<P>
Graham Fraser and Richard Nott of Workers for Freedom, last year's Designer of 
the Year team, showed their usual rich-hippie intellectual clothes, this time 
for a modern-day Millicent Rogers Taos look. (She's the art patron whose house 
is now a museum.) A white-tiered georgette skirt had black tights showing 
underneath, and was topped by a hand-knit sweater decorated with organic images 
and the word Freedom. This was one of the best-attended shows of the week, but 
the collection, while charming and fanciful, lacked the drama to hold a runway. 
</P>
<P>
It is a problem many London collections suffered this season. In his show, Joe 
Caseley-Hayford did himself a disservice by accessorizing the basic, clean 
shapes of his men's and women's collections with clunky hiking boots. And, in 
his quest for a new twist, he may have reached too far. Suits resembled 
doctor's uniforms, with shoulder-button jackets and straight-leg pants -- 
unfortunately, shirred up the side. 
</P>
<P>
John Richmond is a young London talent who is quietly coming into his own. He 
had the coveted Fashion Week windows at Joseph's Brompton Cross showcase 
boutique -- the fashion crowd lunches at Joe's Cafe just across the street -- 
and has built a loyal following through Los Angeles boutiques such as Roppongi 
on Melrose Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
He was among those who chose not to have a runway show, but displayed his new 
collection at Olympia, the fashion trade fair. "Nobody is interested in shows 
any more," Richmond said. "We don't need the hype. For me, the best catwalk 
(runway) is the street." 
</P>
<P>
His clothes, many made of stretch fabrics and almost all of them with hoods, 
reflect what is happening on the street right now. Along with the hooded sweat 
shirt, other themes include long loose jackets worn over stirrup pants and 
leggings, and shorts or minis worn with opaque tights. The American baseball 
cap and sneakers with a contrast-color tongue pulled out over the laces are 
other trends. 
</P>
<P>
It's all rather tame. About the only eccentricity to be seen in London streets 
is the occasional shaved head rising from one of those hooded T-shirts, a 
surrealistic reminder of a more flamboyant past. 
</P>
<P>
Queen of the flamboyant past, and Mother of Punk, designer Vivienne Westwood, 
staged a runway show, late night, at a private club hung with royal portraits. 
Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were at one end of the runway, Edward VII and 
Queen Alexandra at the other when Westwood sent out the answer to a question 
that has been troubling fashionables ever since Milan: namely, can anyone but 
the youngest and skinniest squeeze into the body-clinging shapes that are in 
every collection? Westwood's first model was frankly middle-aged, yet 
definitely had the body to carry off the look. Other than the goofy shoes she 
showed, some of Westwood's clothes were in the best British classic tradition. 
</P>
<P>
British classic too was the mulberry cloque dinner suit that Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher wore to the official reception she held, along with the 
minister of trade, for designers, press and store buyers at London Fashion 
Week. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher's suit, like everything she wears, was designed for her by Marian 
Abrahams of Aquascutum. The same afternoon, Thatcher had received King Hussein 
of Jordan at her country residence. At the fashion party, she worked the room 
like the consummate politician she is, complimenting designer Zandra Rhodes on 
her new, shorter haircut -- "We can see your face so much better, my dear!" -- 
and asking boutique owner Joseph Ettedguie about business. 
</P>
<P>
A concern for the environment was a sub-theme in many of the collections, from 
Stephen Jones' knit hats with an intarsia map of the earth worked around the 
crown to Betty Jackson's intarsia map of Africa on one of her knit coats. 
Jackson explained that the map expressed her concern for "the rain forest." 
Right sentiment, wrong continent. Brazil's rain forests have been the focus of 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
The mistake was emblematic of the London shows this time. Designers seem lost, 
eager to connect with the fashion scene at large through message and 
cause-related clothing. Too often it appears to be just for the sake of keeping 
up with a trend.

A WAY TO MAKE THE SEASON LESS TAXING; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCES: BY SETTING UP A FILING SYSTEM FOR TAX DOCUMENTS NOW, YOU'LL HAVE A 
BETTER CHANCE OF BEING READY NEXT APRIL 15. 
</P>

<P>
It's that dreaded time of the year again: tax season. And if you're knee-deep 
in papers that need to be sorted, you're stuck with a nasty, time-consuming 
task. Why not get organized now for next year? 
</P>
<P>
But which important papers and records to keep and which to toss? And where and 
how long to keep them? 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing is to try to take a more organized approach than most people 
do," said Tom Gau of Kavesh &amp; Gau, a financial planning and tax preparation 
firm in Torrance. "Get a file cabinet and put it in a corner, even a closet. 
Then buy file folders and put things in a logical order. It's a lot easier to 
find things when you do that." 
</P>
<P>
Categorize your files in separate folders: tax returns, property documents, 
utility bills, personal and family records, insurance, medical and health 
records, and financial statements. 
</P>
<P>
You also should keep a master notebook -- a loose-leaf version is recommended 
-- listing each category and its contents. The book should open with personal 
information: your name, address, place of employment, home and office phone 
numbers, Social Security number, next of kin and their addresses and phone 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Although financial advisers disagree on the maximum number of years you should 
keep copies of your income tax returns -- some advise as long as 10 years -- 
most insist on a minimum of four years. A good rule of thumb is to keep them 
six years. 
</P>
<P>
Here's why: California's Franchise Tax Board can examine or challenge your 
state return for four years; by law, the Internal Revenue Service requires you 
keep income tax records for at least three years from the date the return was 
filed. The normal period for an IRS audit, without reason, is three years. 
</P>
<P>
But if the state or the IRS has reason to suspect you failed to report more 
than 25% of your income -- mostly in the cases of being self-employed -- they 
can investigate you for a period extending back six years. If they suspect you 
of filing a fraudulent return, or none at all, there's no time limit. 
</P>
<P>
All documents supporting the return, including a copy of your W-2 stating your 
income from that year, should be kept year by year with a copy of each return 
in a separate folder. As you file your yearly return, discard the folder that 
is more than 10 years old. 
</P>
<P>
There's no sense in cluttering up the house forever with utility bills, but it 
is smart to keep them for two or three years. (Keep them longer if you work at 
home and deduct part of your utility costs.) Why keep these documents? 
</P>
<P>
By law, municipal utilities "have the right to go back two years to recover 
lost revenue," said Jim Derry of the Department of Water and Power. If DWP 
finds a billing error, say through one of its periodic audits, "we can bill 
you," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Public utilities -- such as Southern California Gas or Southern California 
Edison -- can go back further, up to three years to make billing adjustments, 
if the agency believes there's been a consumer error or fraud, reports the 
Public Utilities Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Store original documents (deeds, title papers, mortgages, car titles) in a bank 
safe-deposit box or in a fireproof home safe. Keep copies of them in your home 
records file. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate folder, keep records of all home improvements; save receipts, 
even for a can of paint, because some improvement and remodeling costs can be 
deducted. 
</P>
<P>
Safe-deposit boxes range in size and cost anywhere from $15 to $100 a year. 
Don't keep important documents in spots like desk drawers because they can 
disappear in disasters -- fires, earthquakes and the like. Fireproof files can 
be purchased at stationery or hardware stores for $50 to $125. Be sure your 
model is fireproof and will withstand temperatures of 1,200-degrees Fahrenheit, 
the heat of a typical house fire. For about $200 (without installation), you 
can buy a metal floor safe that can be sunk into concrete. 
</P>
<P>
It's a waste of money to buy many of the cheaper fire-safe files, said Dee 
Erickson, general manager of Wolcotts Legal Forms and Stationery store in 
Downtown Los Angeles. "People want something for nothing," Erickson said, "so 
they buy these other ones that are a lot less expensive, but only protect up to 
500- or 600-degrees Fahrenheit. They're no good." 
</P>
<P>
Like property documents, the originals of most personal and family papers -- 
including birth and death certificates, marriage or divorce decrees, 
citizenship papers, military records and proof of custody or adoption -- should 
be kept in a safe-deposit box, with copies in a home file. Some experts 
recommend that you stash your passport in a safe-deposit box, but other experts 
say to keep it in a safe place at home in case you need it in an emergency -- 
for instance, on a weekend when banks are shut. 
</P>
<P>
List in your notebook: your bank's name and address; your safe-deposit box, its 
number and where to find its key; the names of those with access to the box, 
and a dated list of its contents. 
</P>
<P>
If you have no living relatives, consider giving a trusted friend access to 
your safe-deposit box, in case of an emergency or your death. To accomplish 
this, you and your pal can go to the bank and sign a power of attorney, or you 
may have the document notarized, then taken to the bank. 
</P>
<P>
As for your will, it is best to keep the original in a safe-deposit box but 
store a copy with your attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Maintain a home file with copies of all your insurance policies -- medical, 
life, home, car -- along with receipts and checks to support your insurance 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Milne, of the Western Insurance Information Service in Los Angeles, advises 
consumers to keep original policies in a safe-deposit box, with an inventory of 
their homes' contents. They should "videotape or take photographs room-by-room 
and keep an itemized written inventory list with it," Milne said. "They also 
should make sure to reevaluate the furnishings and the dwelling each year." 
</P>
<P>
(The service will provide consumers with a free, preprinted room-by-room 
inventory list to compile; write to WIIS, 3530 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1465, Los 
Angeles, Calif. 90010.) 
</P>
<P>
Most experts think it's safe to store banking records -- including such items 
as savings passbooks, loan agreements, cancelled checks and promissory notes -- 
in a home file. 
</P>
<P>
But originals of securities, stock certificates or bonds should be kept in safe 
deposit or by a brokerage. List the securities you own and their serial numbers 
in your home files, which also would be a good place to store current, 
pertinent family medical records. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, remember to update your records notebook yearly. Keep the original in 
a safe-deposit box and a copy at home.

Richard Elliot was waiting backstage last week at the Arsenio Hall show. The 
hustle and bustle of television production enveloped him -- ambient waves of 
sound from the audience and the band; a jungle of lights, cameras and technical 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
It was an environment he had experienced many times before as a professional 
musician. But this time it was different. 
</P>
<P>
"I sat there waiting," he said afterward, "knowing that I was going out there 
as a solo performer, knowing I wasn't going to play backup for somebody else. I 
was going to do my own thing. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it sounds like a cliche when I say I had to pinch myself, but I did. 
It was very surreal. When you're used to being a support musician your whole 
life, it's really strange to be out there as you, and not as a sax player for 
somebody else." 
</P>
<P>
Elliot, who appears at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano tonight, has done 
a lot of sax playing for a lot of someone elses. Just turned 30, he already has 
worked with everyone from the Temptations, Smokey Robinson and the Beach Boys 
to Tiffany, Rickie Lee Jones and the Yellowjackets. 
</P>
<P>
But his first real visibility outside the backup crowd came during a five-year 
gig with the hard-driving Tower of Power horn section. By the time he joined 
the band, the tenor chair had successfully launched the careers of Lennie 
Pickett, who became a longtime regular in the "Saturday Night Live" orchestra, 
and Mark Russo of the Yellowjackets. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I played with the Tower of Power rhythm section -- Wow! To 
stand in front of those guys and just have that sound and energy kick you in 
the butt -- it was intimidating and exhilarating at the same time; kind of like 
surfing," he said. "If you don't stay right on top of the wave, it just 
swallows you up." 
</P>
<P>
By the time Elliot left Tower of Power in 1988, he was in the process of 
recording his third solo album, "The Power of Suggestion." A colorful mixture 
of jazz, Latin, rock and R&amp;B sounds, it also included vocal tracks by 
Phillip Ingram and Michael Ruff and did well enough on the sales charts to give 
a vigorous boost to his solo career. 
</P>
<P>
Elliot's current recording, "Take to the Skies" (Intima), boosts that career 
into high-speed overdrive. His cover version of Percy Sledge's hit "When a Man 
Loves a Woman" has become Elliot's most-requested number. Almost as successful 
is Eliot's sensual setting -- sung by Bobby Caldwell -- of "In the Name of 
Love." 
</P>
<P>
Both the album's title and the cover photo (a shot of him in the cockpit of a 
Navy FA-18 fighter plane) testify to the love of flying that has played almost 
as large a role as music in Elliot's life. Earning a license while he was still 
a teen-ager, he piloted Tower of Power to numerous one-nighters, has built his 
own airplane and, most recently, added a glider rating to his pilot's license. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," he said, "flying's a real release for me. And I love gliding. There's 
no engine -- it's just like sailing. I like to call it my metabolic lubricant." 
</P>
<P>
And do the two loves of his life find a way to come together? "Oh, yes," Elliot 
said. "There's a real direct connection. When I'm playing really good I can 
feel it -- the same kind of open, soaring feeling I get from flying. And I 
think the audience can feel it, too." 
</P>
<P>
"Audience" is a word that crops up frequently in Elliot's conversation. The 
calculated mixture of styles that characterizes his recordings, as well as his 
live performances, is no accident. He has managed his career and organized his 
music with a clear and unabashed focus on listener response. 
</P>
<P>
But despite his solid improvisatory skills, his big robust tenor sound and 
rhythmic intensity, Elliot expressed little interest in the isolated career of 
a jazzman. Commercialism holds no terrors for him. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that, deep down inside, almost every musician wants to sell records," 
he said. "You do something, you want acknowledgement for it. You want to know 
that ears are hearing it. Sure, there are people who are in it solely for 
themselves, people who get their pleasure just from playing their instruments, 
and not from their listeners. But they're the exceptions to the rule. For me -- 
I love interacting with my audiences. 
</P>
<P>
"And if listening to my music helps some people get into Charlie Parker and 
John Coltrane, that's great. Everything helps everything else. There's nothing 
wrong with expanding musical horizons. But there's nothing wrong with simple 
musical enjoyment, either. You gotta look at the big picture." 
</P>
<P>
"If it's sincere," he said, "I'm all for it; if it's contrived, the audience 
picks up on it, anyhow. They're really very smart about things like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Elliot plays at 8 tonight at the Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, 
San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $15. Information: (714) 496-8930.

CASTING PROBLEM ASIDE, TENNESSEE WILLIAMS' MONUMENTAL PLAY ABOUT EROTIC TENSION

<P>
The question of alternative casting in Eastern Boys Productions' contemporary 
staging of "A Streetcar Named Desire" was almost irrelevant at Friday's opening 
night -- various problems were more pressing. 
</P>
<P>
But let's address that issue at the start. Director Walter Brown's decision 
(with input from assistant director Steve Scholl) to have a black Stanley 
Kowalski (R.A. Blankenship Jr.) did not necessarily add to Tennessee Williams' 
estimable drama, but neither did it dilute the play's integrity. 
</P>
<P>
It was an uncomfortable choice at times -- especially with all the references 
to Kowalski's Polish origins, without a word about this Stanley's obvious 
African heritage -- but Williams' themes of class struggle and erotic tension 
and vulnerability still peeked through. 
</P>
<P>
However, casting a black actor (Mellow Martin) as Mitch, Stanley's friend and 
Blanche's suitor, was wrong. Considering Blanche's vast affectations built on a 
foundation of old-time Southern propriety, it was too large a stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Her vehement speech to sister Stella, when she describes Stanley as "an ape," 
reinforced a notion of her barely concealed bigotry. Of course, this was not 
Williams' intention -- the lines are meant to show a disdain for Stanley's 
barbarity and her repressed attraction to it, not his color -- but in Brown's 
concept, it reads like a bald, racial slur. In this framework, would Blanche's 
biases allow her to feel closeness to Mitch? 
</P>
<P>
The troubles were more basic than the casting. Technical problems, stalled 
pacing and unresounding portrayals all worked to neuter the power of this 
"Streetcar." 
</P>
<P>
In the production's defense, the actors did have to endure the Santa Ana City 
Hall Police Annex Auditorium's lousy acoustics. Dialogue was routinely 
swallowed, and the cast didn't do much to overcome the predicament. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the performers, only Deirdre West as Blanche approached the pathos of 
"Streetcar." West was often self-conscious, but at least she tried to locate 
the human conflicts and contradictions that can make Blanche and her story so 
compelling.

SLOWDOWN IN RECORD SALES REPORTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New highs in both sales and total units shipped were set by the U.S. record 
industry in 1989, though the sales increase was modest compared to the 
spectacular growth of the previous two years, the Recording Industry Assn. of 
America reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
While the $6.46 billion sales figure and 800.7 million unit mark represented 
growths of 5% and 3.35% respectively, the industry had registered dollar 
increases of 20% in 1987 and 12% in 1988. The slowdown had been widely forecast 
by industry analysts during recent months. 
</P>
<P>
"You had a couple great years before," said Mara Balsbaugh, entertainment 
business analyst for Smith Barney in New York. "But I for one have been 
expecting most of the growth now to come from the foreign market, which it has. 
The dramatic growth (domestically) couldn't keep happening." 
</P>
<P>
Growth in compact disc sales led the way in 1989, as it has the past several 
years, rising from about 150 million sold in 1988 to more than 207 million in 
1989 (a gain of more than 38%). Meanwhile, cassettes lost ground, from 450 
million units in 1988 to 446 million in 1989, though the format still 
represents the largest portion of U.S. sales. 
</P>
<P>
Vinyl LPs and EPs continued to slip rapidly, down 52% from 72.4 million to just 
34.6 million. The largest growth came from the relatively new cassette singles, 
which rose nearly 240% to 76 million sold, overtaking their vinyl counterpart, 
which dropped 44% from 65.6 million to 36.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Some in the industry have blamed flat sales on the consumer interest peak in 
cassettes, coupled with the relatively high price of CDs, but Balsbaugh 
believes lowering CD prices has been demonstrated as ineffective so far. 
However, she still sees potential for renewed growth in the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting CD penetration into the market up further is going to be meaningful," 
she said. "And introduction of new format (Digital Audio Tape) is going to 
help."

The arraignment of a Pasadena funeral home worker charged with fatally 
poisoning a rival mortician with oleander leaves was delayed Tuesday and an 
April 6 hearing set on his request to be represented by a private attorney 
rather than the county public defender. 
</P>
<P>
David Wayne Sconce, 33, originally asked that Roger John Diamond, of Santa 
Monica, serve as his court-appointed lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
He argued that Diamond, who represented him in a related criminal proceeding 
last year, is familiar with the case. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge Barry B. Klopfer appointed Deputy Public Defender Susan Tandy 
Olson instead, prompting an appeal by Diamond. It is scheduled to be heard by 
Superior Court Judge Lawrence Storch. 
</P>
<P>
Sconce faces the death penalty and is indigent. 
</P>
<P>
Sconce is charged with murdering Timothy R. Waters, 24, a Burbank mortician, to 
keep him from exposing activities at the Lamb Funeral Home where Sconce worked. 
Waters died in his mother's home in Ventura County, so Sconce is being tried 
here. 
</P>
<P>
Sconce is serving a five-year prison term after pleading guilty last year to 
the mingling of human remains, the theft of body parts and the removal of gold 
teeth from cadavers at the funeral home. DARYL KELLEY

Eastern Airlines Veto 
</P>
<P>
The House failed to override President Bush's veto of a bill (HR 1231) 
injecting the government into the dispute between Eastern Airlines and the 
striking International Assn. of Machinists. The tally was 261 to 160. 
</P>
<P>
A two-thirds majority was needed to override. 
</P>
<P>
Under the bill backed by organized labor, a panel appointed by Congress was to 
have made non-binding recommendations on ending the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Override supporter Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.) called the bill "our last hope of 
restoring Eastern as a competitive airline." 
</P>
<P>
"When no transportation emergency exists . . . the President and Congress have 
no role to play in labor disputes," said veto-supporter Mickey Edwards 
(R-Okla.). 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to override the veto.

To Help U.S. Foundries 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 382 to 27, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 1243) setting 
up three government research centers to help the faltering metal casting 
industry become more competitive. The new federal program would cost the 
Treasury $15 million over three years, and foundries also would fund it. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Ben Erdreich (D-Ala.) said "over half of U.S. foundries have closed 
since 1971, putting tens of thousands of Americans out of work." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Bill Frenzel (R-Minn.) asked, "Why should the government finance 
projects for industries which do not finance them themselves?" 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to create a new program to help the metal casting 
industry.

TRAVELING COSTS TURN SWEET SMELL OF PLAYOFF SUCCESS SOUR; 
</P>
<P>
STATE TOURNAMENT: HIGH SCHOOLS ARE DIPPING INTO THEIR OWN POCKETS TO MEET 
EXPENSES INCURRED DURING THE POSTSEASON.

<P>
As Servite High School prepares for its first state basketball championship 
game, the Friars are learning that the price of success can be costly. 
</P>
<P>
Athletic Director Tom Vitello said the Friars already have lost $760 traveling 
to a first-round regional game. They could lose as much as $1,100 more when the 
team travels to play Hayward Mt. Eden on Saturday in the Division III 
championship game at the Oakland Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
But Servite's athletic department isn't the only one in Orange County dipping 
into its pockets to meet costs during the state playoffs: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mater Dei expects to lose $6,000 on its trip to the state Division I 
championship game on Saturday at the Oakland Coliseum. The Monarchs used 
private donations to cover a $6,000 expense loss when they won the 1987 
Division I title. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Woodbridge High School lost about $4,500 in travel expenses when the 
Warriors won the 1987 Division II title. 
</P>
<P>
Vitello and other athletic directors and coaches have criticized the state 
California Interscholastic Federation for earning a profit from the tournament 
while schools struggle to pay travel costs. They say teams that reach the state 
tournament are penalized for their success. 
</P>
<P>
College teams complain when they miss out on $286,500 that the NCAA gives them 
for making the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"The (high school) state tournament is completely the opposite," Woodbridge 
Coach Bill Shannon said. "It's a 180-degree turnaround." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Jelnick, Corona del Mar athletic director, said he's not sure if the 
school's athletic department can afford a trip to the state tournament next 
year. Corona del Mar expects to barely break even after playing a first-round 
regional game at San Diego Lincoln and a semifinal game at Servite. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not real happy with the state playoffs," Jelnick said. "We don't get 
anything out of it. Only reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all negative. There's nothing positive coming out of it. If we would have 
gone up to state this week, we would have had to put a lot of money up. I don't 
know if we will go into the state playoffs again." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Byrnes, commissioner of athletics for the state CIF office, said last 
year's state tournament earned a net profit of $160,000. He said the profit is 
returned to the office's general budget to pay for operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's expensive for all schools to run athletic programs," he said. "Schools 
don't get reimbursed for travel (to the state tournament) in most sports. The 
fact that basketball is, is a plus. 
</P>
<P>
"Teams have 400 to 500 contests on all levels every year. They have to travel 
to get to many of them. The CIF games are just a drop in the bucket." 
</P>
<P>
The state CIF office reimburses a school 50 cents for every allotted ticket 
sold for a regional and state tournament game, not including box-office sales. 
</P>
<P>
Adults pay $6 per ticket and students $3 per ticket for regional games. Tickets 
for the state finals in Oakland are $10, $8, $7 and $5. 
</P>
<P>
Shannon said the policy has a major flaw. 
</P>
<P>
"How many fans are going to buy a presale ticket for Oakland?" Shannon said. 
"If you have an immense following, let's say you bring 1,000 fans, you still 
get only $500 from the tickets. That will pay for only three players to go to 
Oakland out of the Orange County Airport." 
</P>
<P>
The CIF also pays schools $2 a mile for teams traveling by air and $1 a mile 
for traveling by bus or van. The CIF also pays for meals if a team travels more 
than 100 miles one way. 
</P>
<P>
Vitello said the reimbursement money isn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
"There should be some kind of formula that will allow us to at least break even 
on these things," Vitello said. "The meal allowance and lodging I can 
understand. But the (assistant) coaches are paying their own way." 
</P>
<P>
Byrnes said the mileage money the state tournament offers is more than all but 
one section tournament. The Southern Section pays 75 cents a mile round trip 
for travel. 
</P>
<P>
"At least there's some reimbursement for some playoffs," Byrnes said. "What 
about wrestling, track and volleyball? There's no (travel) reimbursement at all 
for those sports. Team sports like basketball are better off. 
</P>
<P>
"Travel expenses are not something that just occur in state playoffs. They have 
to play all those games all year long." 
</P>
<P>
Schools make little, if any, money off allotted ticket sales. Vitello said 
Servite had 500 allotted tickets for its first-round game at Lemoore March 6. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't sell any of them," Vitello said. "The game was on Tuesday and we 
found out on Sunday that we were playing up there. We had no chance to sell 
any. We made zero off it, zip. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if we would have split the gate with Lemoore, we wouldn't have made $100. 
There weren't many people there." 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei had no problem selling the 500 tickets allotted for each of its three 
state playoff games. Assistant principal John Merino said the school wasn't 
given enough. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole state tournament process needs to be changed," Merino said. "The 
Southern Section tournament is very well organized and it benefits kids. They 
put the student section right by the court and the whole thing promotes 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
"The state tournament doesn't do that. They didn't give us enough tickets for 
our games and we had people standing in line at the L.A. Sports Arena the day 
of the game to get us more." 
</P>
<P>
Vitello said Servite lost $760 traveling to Lemoore. Servite chartered a bus to 
make the 440-mile round-trip trek from Anaheim to Lemoore. The school also paid 
for lodging and meals for coaches, players, a trainer and cheerleader 
coordinator, Vitello said. 
</P>
<P>
"We chartered a bus for $1,001," Vitello said. "We were reimbursed only $1 a 
mile by the CIF, so we lost (about) $600 right there." 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei spent $7,800 on travel for the 1987 state tournament, and the CIF 
reimbursed the school $1,800. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1987 Southern Section 2-A playoffs, Woodbridge played Righetti High at 
Santa Maria and met Victor Valley High at Apple Valley. They played at Fresno 
in the Division II regional before moving to the final at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Although the school lost money, Shannon said, reaching the state finals was 
worth it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's impossible to turn down the opportunity to go," Shannon said. "You go to 
the tournament and then you do your best to make ends meet financially. We had 
a little bit of money in reserve, but mainly our school district paid for our 
expenses." 
</P>
<P>
Besides flying the team to the championship game, Mater Dei also brings its 
band and pep squad on a bus. Mater Dei, a private school, relied on donations 
to pay for the travel costs in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing the same thing this year," Merino said. 
</P>
<P>
Vitello's not sure where Servite will get the money. Servite is a private 
school that charges tuition, but Vitello said he has "cut our athletic budget 
to the bone." 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say, 'No, we're not going to playoffs,' because that hurts the kids," 
Vitello said. "The only thing we can do is ask the parents to make up the 
difference. We're going to pass the hat and hope we can collect enough to make 
up at least part of our costs." 
</P>
<P>
Byrnes said schools get to keep profits from concessions on home games; that 
helps pay for travel costs. 
</P>
<P>
"That can be a pretty nice trade-off," Byrnes said. 
</P>
<P>
Servite made $250 from presale tickets when it played host to Corona del Mar in 
the Division III semifinals. But all the concessions money went to the booster 
club instead of the school's budget. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to trim expenses, Vitello suggested that the team charter two 
vans for the trip to the state finals in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"The players' parents wanted the kids to fly up there and be relaxed in time 
for the game," Vitello said. "We expect to (spend) at least another $4,600 on 
this trip. And after the CIF reimburses us, I'd say we will get roughly half of 
that back." 
</P>
<P>
Vitello said Father Patrick Donovan, Servite's principal, is writing a letter 
of appeal to the CIF office asking for more reimbursement for the Lemoore trip. 
</P>
<P>
"We're asking for $200 to $300 of the ($1,960) total," Vitello said. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar Coach Paul Orris said the travel reimbursements are one of many 
issues troubling the state tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a second-class operation," Orris said. "When we went out to the CIF 
office to get the draws, they gave us nothing like rosters or who we were 
dealing with or when we played. There are a lot problems that need to be ironed 
out. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's fair that Southern California teams have to drive up to 
Oakland every year. Why not have the tournament at alternating sites each 
year?" 
</P>
<P>
Jelnick said it's up to the schools to help find an answer. 
</P>
<P>
"If enough people are complaining, maybe we should sit down and look at this," 
he said. "If they ask everyone to play and if everyone says no, then let's see 
what they do."

LAST STRETCH OF BEACH CLOSED BY TANKER OIL SPILL IS REOPENED

<P>
A public ban was lifted today on the last 1 1/2-mile stretch of Orange County 
shoreline closed after the tanker American Trader ruptured its hull last month, 
spilling 394,000 gallons of crude oil into the ocean off Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
A mid-afternoon ceremony was hastily arranged to mark the reopening of beach 
between Golden West Street in Huntington Beach and the main lifeguard 
headquarters at Bolsa Chica State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to lift the ban was made after a series of tests showed that 
levels of petroleum hydrocarbons were well below acceptable levels established 
by local and state health officials. 
</P>
<P>
At one stage after the Feb. 7 tanker accident, more than 20 miles of county 
coastline was closed as the Alaskan crude formed a huge slick before washing 
ashore, blackening long stretches of shoreline. The cleanup force numbered 
nearly 1,500 at the height of the effort, but British Petroleum, which owned 
the spilled oil, said only about 30 workers remained on the job today. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Coast Guard officials said preliminary results of its 
investigation into the accident about 1.3 miles southwest of Huntington Beach 
may be completed within two weeks. Authorities have said that one of the 
tanker's anchors apparently gashed the forward hull, causing the spill.

VAN DE KAMP ASKS PILL'S TESTING 
</P>

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp, campaigning for the Democratic gubernatorial 
nomination, today proposed that California health officials move to approve 
testing of the so-called abortion pill used in Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp said that California authorities, by approving testing, could 
pressure federal authorities to make the drug available. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp, who according to polls is trailing former San Francisco Mayor 
Dianne Feinstein in the Democratic governor's race, said that women have the 
right to choose whether they want to use the French drug RU-486. 
</P>
<P>
"I realize full well that this will be a controversial proposal. I have to say 
there is nothing more personal, more private than the decision a woman takes to 
give birth to a child," Van de Kamp said in Los Angeles.

COMPUTER CHIP ROBBERY IN IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Irvine police today were looking for several men who allegedly broke into an 
Irvine electronics firm Tuesday night and escaped with an undisclosed amount of 
computer chips (See earlier story, B1.) 
</P>
<P>
Four or five men wearing masks and hoods entered the Centon Electronics Inc. 
building on Morgan Street about 8:30 p.m. and handcuffed and bound three 
employees, Irvine Lt. Vic Thies said. The men were armed with handguns and 
shotguns, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The robbers had fled by the time police arrived, Thies said, and the employees 
were unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
Thies said the robbery was similar to a rash of thefts in Southern California, 
particularly Orange County, that have cost companies millions of dollars in 
computer chips.

Mikhail S. Gorbachev was the only man left on the ballot today for Soviet 
legislators to select as the country's new, powerful president, and his victory 
appeared certain. 
</P>
<P>
Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov and Interior Minister Vadim A. Bakatin had been 
nominated for the post by a group calling itself Soyuz, or Union, which is 
opposed to efforts by Soviet republics to break away, but both withdrew. 
</P>
<P>
Balloting was to begin later tonight and results were expected Thursday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Although uncontested, Gorbachev could still be defeated if less than 50% of the 
2,250 members in the Congress of People's Deputies participate in the vote or 
if the majority of those voting cross his name off the ballot. That was highly 
unlikely, however. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies narrowly agreed earlier today that they, and not the Soviet people, 
would elect the Soviet Union's new president to a four-year term.

Vice President Dan Quayle, whose meeting this week with Nicaragua's Marxist 
President Daniel Ortega ended years of U.S. estrangement, said today he will 
not repeat the gesture with Cuba's Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
Castro and Quayle are attending Thursday's presidential inauguration in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
But Quayle told reporters, "We're not going to meet with Castro. We have no 
desire to meet with Castro." 
</P>
<P>
He responded to a reporter's question about Castro before leaving Argentina for 
Brasilia. Brazil is the last stop on his weeklong South American trip, which 
included a 90-minute talk Monday in Chile with Ortega. 
</P>
<P>
At a Buenos Aires news conference, Quayle repeated his contention that Castro 
is increasingly isolated. "Eventually democracy and freedom will come to Cuba," 
Quayle predicted. "Castro must sooner or later change."

President Bush, continuing a round of consultation with NATO allies, will meet 
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on April 13 and French President 
Francois Mitterrand on April 19, the White House said today. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting with Thatcher will take place in the Atlantic resort island of 
Bermuda. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting with Mitterrand will be held in Florida but a site has not yet been 
selected. 
</P>
<P>
British officials said Eastern Europe and South Africa would dominate the 
informal discussions between Bush and Thatcher. Thatcher has been deeply 
concerned over the pace of negotiations for German reunification and other 
developments in Europe. Bush also has expressed surprise over the speed of the 
changes in Eastern Europe where Communist regimes are collapsing. 
</P>

No reason or agenda was given for the unscheduled meeting between Bush and

Fidel Castro, on the eve of a trip to Brazil that he said will show Cuba is not 
isolated despite the changes sweeping his Communist allies, vowed that foreign 
leaders will never sway him to make concessions. 
</P>
<P>
Castro told a rally of thousands of students in Havana late Tuesday that he 
knows that while he is in Brazil Thursday for the presidential inauguration of 
Fernando Collor de Mello, other foreign leaders will have plenty of advice for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what it will be in advance, I know it by heart," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Castro, who has led Cuba for 31 years, said he expects that some other leaders 
will tell him that he should "behave himself, be a good boy, make concessions." 
</P>
<P>
"Should we make concessions?" he asked the crowd, estimated by organizers at 
more than 40,000. 
</P>
<P>
"No," they roared. 
</P>
<P>
"Never, that's the word, never," Castro said. "No revolution that ever makes 
concessions can save itself." 
</P>
<P>
Castro said his trip to Brazil would show that Cuba is not becoming 
internationally isolated despite the changes sweeping out communism in Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to show the imperialists that we're not in the least bit frightened of 
them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Castro has defiantly rejected the Western-leaning reforms being embraced in 
Eastern Europe and insists Cuba will never abandon its one-party Communist 
system. 
</P>
<P>
"We know what a revolution is, what a revolution does," said Castro, who has 
ruled the Caribbean island since leading the 1959 popular revolution that 
toppled right-wing dictator Fulgencio Batista. 
</P>
<P>
The Cuban leader added he will discuss with the other leaders in Brazil issues 
such as the problem of Latin American debt and what he called the unequal 
economic relations between rich and poor nations. 
</P>
<P>
The Havana rally was held to celebrate the 33rd anniversary of an attempt in 
1957 by a group of revolutionary students to kill Batista at his presidential 
palace.

TALKS ON GERMAN UNITY WILL INCLUDE POLAND IN DISCUSSIONS OF BORDER

The four World War II Allies and the two Germanys, ending their first session 
of talks on German unity, said today that they have agreed to include Poland in 
their discussions when they deal with the Polish border. 
</P>
<P>
Dieter Kastrup, head of the West German delegation, said the group -- the 
Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France and East and West Germany -- 
discussed procedural issues and had a first exchange of views on an agenda for 
future talks. 
</P>
<P>
Kastrup did not say how Polish representatives will participate in the talks 
among the two Germanys and the World War II allies. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was a triumph for Warsaw, which launched a diplomatic drive for a 
say at the talks when West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl tried to keep open the 
border issue and to force Poland to swear off postwar reparations claims. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl has pledged to support a treaty fixing the border. 
</P>
<P>
"The participants agreed Poland will be invited as soon as questions are 
discussed . . . that especially affect its borders," Kastrup, a senior official 
of the West German Foreign Ministry, told journalists after the daylong 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Almost one-third of Polish territory is former German land handed over to 
Warsaw after the war to compensate for Polish territory seized to the east by 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The border issue blew up this month when Kohl, increasingly assertive as 
Germany nears unity, tried to pressure Poland to please right-wing voters eager 
to reclaim that land. 
</P>
<P>
The attempt sparked protests abroad and aroused fears that the new Germany, a 
superstate of 78 million people, would throw its weight around like its 
historic predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
Kastrup said delegations at these talks, held at a round table with the two 
Germanys sitting side by side, discussed procedural issues about the talks due 
to last several months. 
</P>
<P>
The discussions, dubbed the "two-plus-four" talks, are aimed at agreements on 
whether a united Germany is neutral or in the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization, where its borders will be and what Berlin's status will be. 
</P>
<P>
"They also had an initial exchange of ideas on about which topics are to be 
handled on the agenda of future sessions," Kastrup said. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry officials will meet again in East Berlin soon after East 
Germany's first free elections Sunday, and alternate between Bonn and East 
Berlin thereafter.

Here's an insight that may fail to shock dedicated students of the mating game: 
People often tell lies in order to have sex. 
</P>
<P>
Two California researchers reached that conclusion about dating behavior after 
taking a survey of college students. 
</P>
<P>
They say it's a point worth keeping in mind when trying to decide whether 
potential sexual partners have ever done anything to put themselves at risk of 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
In the survey, 34% of male respondents and 10% of women admitted they had "told 
a lie in order to have sex." Even more said they would lie if a situation arose 
where it would be to their advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"The implications of our findings are clear," the researchers wrote in 
Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. "Patients should be cautioned that 
safe-sex strategies are always advisable, despite arguments to the contrary 
from partners." The survey was conducted by Drs. Susan D. Cochran of California 
State University, Northridge, and Vickie M. Mays of UCLA.

SmithKline Beecham PLC reported today that its profits for 1989 declined 65% 
over a year ago due largely to heavy costs associated with the recent merger 
that created the world's second-largest pharmaceuticals company. 
</P>
<P>
The company said its net profit totaled $209 million, compared with $591 
million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Sales, however, rose 14% to $7.9 billion from $6.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The full-year results were the first for the company since its merger in July, 
1989. Britain's Beecham Group PLC and Philadelphia-based SmithKline Beckman 
Corp. merged through an exchange of shares, creating the second-largest 
pharmaceuticals company after Rahway, N.J.-based Merck &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 results included an $805-million restructuring charge as a result of 
the combination for closing some of its facilities, cutting staff and writing 
down certain assets. SmithKline Beecham said it also took a $124-million 
extraordinary loss due to merger transaction costs.

U.S. RICE PRODUCERS IN UNFRIENDLY FIELDS;

JAPAN: AMERICANS PROMOTE PRODUCT IN TOKYO EVEN THOUGH THEY CAN'T EVEN GIVE THE

<P>
Rice producers from the United States today began trying to promote 
American-grown rice in Japan -- a country where imported rice cannot even be 
given away. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. rice industry group opened its promotion despite Japan's total ban on 
commercial imports of the staple grain. 
</P>
<P>
In Japan, any public use of foreign rice is prohibited by the food control law, 
and regulations even limit the amount that private individuals can bring into 
the country. This prevents the U.S. Rice Millers Assn. from even giving away 
free samples as it promotes its product. 
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the U.S. Rice Millers Assn. was quoted as saying that the 
United States could supply half a million metric tons annually if Japan lifted 
its barriers to imports. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Caffey told a news conference that the United States wanted access to 
Japan's rice market, but not the total liberalization of the market, Kyodo News 
Service reported. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. rice group is attending an international food convention here and will 
present information about U.S.-grown rice and the goals of the U.S. industry. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Embassy spokesman said the promotion was not intended "to offend the 
Japanese government or apply political pressure to liberalize rice 
importation." 
</P>
<P>
Rice is the last major item on which Japan bans commercial imports. The grain 
has special significance in the Japanese culture, and the domestic crop 
cultivated on its scarce farmland is considered a symbol of the island nation's 
self-sufficiency. 
</P>
<P>
With annual consumption of 10 million metric tons, half a million tons would 
represent 5% of the Japanese rice market. 
</P>
<P>
But senior U.S. Rice Millers Assn. official David Graves told reporters at the 
same news conference that this estimate for U.S. exports could be too high if 
preferences for certain kinds of rice by Japanese are considered, Kyodo 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
In October, 1988, the association filed a petition urging Washington to impose 
tariffs and quotas on Japanese exports unless Tokyo allowed foreign producers 
to supply 10% of the country's domestic demand for rice within four years.

Stock prices rose today, rebounding from Tuesday's mild setback. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 13.29 points at 2,687.84, with 
gainers outpacing losing issues 4-to-3. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 145.9 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said investors sold stock index futures and bought the underlying 
issues, helping the Dow industrials to gain after a mixed day of trading. 
</P>
<P>
The market retreated Tuesday as interest rates came under new upward pressure 
in the credit markets. Rates declined in today's activity, giving some 
encouragement to stock traders. 
</P>
<P>
Most analysts agree that stocks have benefited lately from hopes that the 
economy could emerge from its recent period of weakness without having to 
undergo a full-blown recession. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers say that kind of optimism would be buttressed if interest rates do not 
go much higher than their current levels. 
</P>
<P>
Worries persist, however, that borrowing costs in this country would keep 
increasing if rates climb further in such other prominent industrialized 
nations as Japan and West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Government bond prices bobbed up today after being pounded down Tuesday as the 
dollar declined and a retail sales report drew negative reactions. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the buying was concentrated in the long end of the credit market and 
short-term government bonds posted only minor gains. Interest rates, which fall 
when prices rise, receded slightly. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond, which tumbled more than 1 point 
Tuesday, regained 7/16 point, or nearly $2.50 per $1,000 in face amount. Its 
yield fell to 8.66% from 8.71% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Goldinger of the investment firm Capital Insights in Beverly Hills, Calif., 
said business was active in the bond market mainly because traders were 
realigning short positions previously established on expectations of further 
price weakness. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this morning's gains, he said a bearish attitude prevailed in the 
market. Uncertainty about the economic outlook has made for volatile trading, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the uncertainty was in anticipation of new economic statistics due 
later this week. Reports on wholesale inflation and industrial production in 
February are due on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
News this morning that business inventories edged up 0.2% in January while 
sales expanded 0.3% had no impact on bonds or interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Market analysts said the report was virtually ignored because it dealt with 
January's economic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of short-term 
government issues added 1/16 point to 3/32 point, intermediate maturities rose 
5/32 point to 7/16 point, and long-term issues gained 7/16 point to 17/32 
point, according to figures provided by Telerate Inc., a financial information 
service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, was up 1.83 to 1,145.57. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills dipped to 8.20% as the discount edged 1 
basis point lower to 7.95%. Yields on six-month bills declined to 8.28% as the 
discount shed 3 basis points to 7.86%. Yields on one-year bills fell to 8.41% 
as the discount went down 3 basis points to 7.81%.

FRANCE TO GET PICASSO WORKS IN LIEU OF TAXES

France is to receive a huge collection of Pablo Picasso's works in lieu of 
death duties on the estate of the late artist's widow, Jacqueline, the Culture 
Ministry said today. 
</P>
<P>
The collection includes 49 paintings, 38 drawings, 24 drawing books, two 
sculptures, 19 ceramics, seven lithographs and 240 prints, according to the 
ministry. 
</P>
<P>
Jacqueline Picasso, the Spanish painter's second wife, killed herself with a 
single bullet to the head in October, 1986, at her country home of Mougins in 
southeastern France. She was 60. 
</P>
<P>
The ministry statement did not say how much the collection is worth, but art 
experts estimated it at several million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"This selection of works by Pablo Picasso represents all the aspects of the 
creation of this artist during a very long period spanning from 1896 to the 
last years of his life," the ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
The collection includes a 1913 collage by Georges Braque, "Tivoli Cinema." 
</P>
<P>
Picasso married Jacqueline Roque in 1961. At the time, she was a model 44 years 
his junior. 
</P>
<P>
When Picasso died in 1973 at age 79, Jacqueline was one of his six heirs. She 
received one-quarter of the artist's estate in 1977, after years of legal 
wrangling. 
</P>
<P>
When Jacqueline's daughter, Catherine Hutin, hands over the art collection in 
lieu of death duties, part of the works will be allocated to museums in several 
towns outside Paris and the rest will go on show at the Picasso Museum in the 
French capital.

Sammy Davis Jr. will recuperate at home after being hospitalized for a

<P>
"Right now the doctors want him to concentrate on building his strength," said 
publicist Susan Reynolds.

<P>
"The initial chemotherapy has been completed. His spirits are up and he

</P>
<P>
The 64-year-old's condition was first diagnosed as carcinoma of the throat last 
September, and he was forced to cancel concert dates with Liza Minnelli and 
Frank Sinatra to undergo radiation treatment.

<TEXT>
<P>
An early spring has forced Bruce Willis' "Die Hard II" production crew out of 
town and north to Kinross in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Twentieth Century Fox sent Willis, and most of the production crew, back to Los 
Angeles over the weekend when unseasonably warm weather melted the snow in 
Alpena needed for the winter action movie. 
</P>
<P>
Location manager Greg Lazzaro said producers shot only about half of the 
planned winter blizzard scenes at the Alpena County Regional Airport before the 
snow stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Today, "Die Hard II" stunt doubles and a secondary crew will work out of the 
old Kincheloe Air Force Base in Kinross. 
</P>
<P>
The weather in Alpena turned fast. Temperatures dropped as low as minus-5 last 
Tuesday, the first night of shooting in Alpena. It was in the 60s four days 
later. 
</P>
<P>
Alpena itself was a substitute location for Moses Lake, Wash., where warm 
weather last month plagued producers.

Hikers have found the skeleton of a 70-year-old man who was sought in the 
September slaying of his wife, a case featured on the television show "Unsolved 
Mysteries," authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Frisino of the King County medical examiner's office identified the man 
Monday as Joe Lynn Owens. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy will determine the cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sad ending to a sad case," said homicide Sgt. Joe Ritter. "I wish he 
would have at least left something to tell us why he did it." 
</P>
<P>
Owens disappeared Sept. 7, the day after police questioned him about the 
disappearance of his 78-year-old wife, Gladys. Her body was found Sept. 14 
under a false floor below a compost pile at the couple's west Seattle home 
after police acted on tips. She died of a gunshot wound to the back of the 
head. 
</P>
<P>
King County police Maj. Jackson Beard said investigators were called to a trail 
about 30 miles east of Seattle on Sunday after two hikers found a human back 
bone. 
</P>
<P>
Police searched the area Monday and found more bones, clothing, Owens' hearing 
aid, glasses and a gun.

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: MOST INNOCENT OF MEDICINES COULD IMPAIR MOTORIST

The officer was convinced the elderly woman who had run off the side of the 
road was drunk. She couldn't walk a straight line, her speech was garbled and 
she seemed confused. He arrested her on a charge of DWI (driving while 
impaired) and took her in for a breath test. 
</P>
<P>
To everyone's surprise she passed the test with flying colors -- no alcohol in 
her system. But she was still impaired, not from illicit drugs, but from the 
medicine her doctor had prescribed, a combination of a nerve pill and an 
antidepressant. 
</P>
<P>
Millions of people who would never think of drinking and driving are out on the 
roads endangering themselves and others because of something as simple as an 
over-the-counter (OTC) allergy medicine or cold remedy. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement agencies in this country are finally beginning to recognize 
this problem. In California police can pull you over for "driving under the 
influence" even if you haven't had a drop of alcohol. Physicians, pharmacists 
and patients have generally underestimated the impact of both prescription and 
OTC medications on motor coordination and driving ability. Many people confuse 
impairment with drowsiness. But it may be difficult to tell when you are 
impaired. 
</P>
<P>
Someone who has had a few beers may feel all right and still be a hazard behind 
the wheel. Equally, an older person who takes flurazepam (Dalmane) to get to 
sleep may not realize she is weaving in traffic the next day. 
</P>
<P>
A Dutch study found that the antidepressant amitriptyline (Elavil) at normal 
doses "had a more detrimental effect on driving performance than the 
intoxicating dosage of alcohol." 
</P>
<P>
In another test, police officers who took a therapeutic dose of the popular 
anti-anxiety agent diazepam (Valium) had difficulty keeping their cars in the 
proper lane. 
</P>
<P>
How can you tell if your medicine will affect your driving ability? 
Unfortunately, warnings about this problem are often buried in the fine print 
on the package of an OTC medication. Many consumers overlook cautions and 
warnings or fail to take them seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Many prescription antianxiety agents and antidepressants have warnings to avoid 
driving, but doctors may sometimes fail to impress their patients with the 
danger. 
</P>
<P>
Before you get in your car, review every medication you take.

LIZ SMITH: 'THREE MEN AND A BABY' IS 6 YEARS OLD, FILMING

REMEMBER "Three Men and a Baby"? Well, how could you forget that fluffy little 
thing; it was such a big hit! Now "Three Men and a Little Lady" will reunite 
Tom Selleck, Ted Danson and Steve Guttenberg. It goes before the cameras April 
9 in Los Angeles before moving to New York and Great Britain for further 
filming. 
</P>
<P>
In this sequel, the baby, named Mary, will be 6 years old. The plot is to 
revolve around how her mother, Sylvia (actress Nancy Travis), is getting ready 
to marry an English director. This means she will have to move abroad. The 
three men who adore Mary are desperate, particularly Selleck, who has fallen in 
love with Sylvia. So the three guys tour England, trying to prevent the 
wedding. 
</P>
<P>
WHO WERE the most glamorous, best-groomed women at the People's Choice Awards 
last Sunday? Without a doubt, Raquel Welch and Jane Fonda took the honors for 
pizazz and yet neither of these stunners will ever see 40 again. So much for 
the Youthquake. Jane did appear to be having some problem with her cue cards 
and it was fascinating -- as live television often is -- to see this usually 
composed creature so flustered. 
</P>
<P>
Roseanne Barr took home two awards, so in spite of the unsavory publicity that 
constantly surrounds her, the public obviously still adores her. But she gets 
this year's award for the worst acceptance speech. Really, shouldn't these 
performers prepare just a little bit in case they win? It hurts their image to 
appear so edgy, nervous and inarticulate. "You know, you know, you know" -- if 
only this expression could be expunged from nervous speakers, the whole world 
would improve. 
</P>
<P>
CARROLL O'CONNOR has just marked the first anniversary of his serious heart 
surgery and gall bladder removal but he was too busy to party. The great star 
of "In the Heat of the Night" and his wife, Nancy, are remodeling their Beverly 
Hills restaurant. This was formerly The Ginger Man but will soon be known as 
Carroll O'Connor's Place. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll's series for NBC wrapped for the season on Feb. 28, but he went right 
to work on the above without a vacation. On April 1, he'll serve on Harry 
Belafonte's committee for the Transafrica Benefit, and on April 7 Carroll 
receives the John Wayne Cancer Clinic's Humanitarian Award in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
So how about those stories in the Enquirer that say Carroll is almost too 
deeply depressed to move? This time he shrugs. Not true, sez Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
ANDREI KONCHALOVSKY may be best known to you as the Russian who was once a big 
heartthrob to Shirley MacLaine. But let's not forget his first American film in 
1985, "Runaway Train," was nominated for three Academy Awards. After that he 
did "Maria's Lovers," "Duet for One" and "Shy People." 
</P>
<P>
So, Konchalovsky, the first Russian director to make movies in the United 
States, is now going to return to the Soviet Union for the first time in 11 
years. He will film "The Projectionist," marking the first time a motion 
picture has been shot behind the walls of the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
This is the tale of a loyal Stalinist who becomes Old Joe's personal 
projectionist. Such an idea was unthinkable even six months ago, but now the 
"Amadeus" star Tom Hulce is to be co-starred with Lolita Davidovich (you saw 
her in the title role of "Blaze") in a film by Konchalovsky and Anatoly Usov.

Lisa Leslie of Morningside High School in Inglewood, Calif., and Damon Bailey 
of North Lawrence High School in Bedford, Ind., have been named Naismith 
Basketball Players of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
The recipients were named Tuesday by the Atlanta Tipoff Club and Days Inns of 
America Inc. They will receive their awards at the 22nd Annual Naismith Awards 
Banquet on April 5 in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
With the 6-foot-5 Leslie leading the way, Morningside will seek its second 
straight California state championship Saturday. Believed to be the first to 
dunk in a girls' high school game, Leslie is averaging 27 points, 15 rebounds 
and 7.5 blocked shots a game. Earlier this year, she scored 100 points in the 
first half of a Morningside victory. 
</P>
<P>
A 3.5 honors student, Leslie has been class president for three straight years. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey, a 6-foot-3 forward, is the greatest scorer in Indiana high school 
history. He had scored 3,206 points as North Lawrence, 25-2, headed into this 
week's semifinal state action. With Bailey earning all-state honors for four 
straight years, the Stars have compiled a 95-11 record. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey accepted a scholarship to Indiana before the start of the season.

Pitcher Dave Leiper, who suffered a mild heart attack in 1988, was hospitalized 
early this week after experiencing what Oakland Athletics' officials described 
as "a flutter" in his chest. 
</P>
<P>
"It brings up the same issues as Hank Gathers at Loyola Marymount," said a 
concerned Sandy Alderson, general manager of the A's, referring to the college 
basketball star who died two weeks ago after his heart gave out during a game. 
</P>
<P>
Leiper spent Monday night in a Scottsdale hospital and was released on Tuesday. 
Alderson said he would meet today with the 27-year-old pitcher and consult with 
team physician Dr. Alan Pont.

A judge today ordered New York Mets outfielder Darryl Strawberry to pay $40,000 
in past-due child support payments and an additional $2,000 a month to a woman 
who says the baseball star fathered her son. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Philip Sweeney of the St. Louis County Circuit Court said Strawberry, who 
did not contest a blood test indicating that he is the child's father, earns 
$110,000 a month and is seeking a multimillion-dollar contract. 
</P>
<P>
The child was born in June, 1988, to Lisa Clayton, who had sought more than 
$11,000 a month in support payments. 
</P>
<P>
Under Sweeney's order, both the $40,000 representing past support and the 
$2,000 a month in future payments will be divided between the mother and a 
court-appointed representative of the child.

The NFL Management Council has had preliminary talks with the dormant players' 
union about instituting a salary cap as the two sides try to solve a 2 1/2-year 
impasse. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Donlan, the management council's executive director, said today that the 
talks had taken the form of "settlement discussions" of the antitrust suit 
filed by the union at the end of its 24-day strike in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
He also said there are too many variables to specify the form the system would 
take. 
</P>
<P>
But he said the incentive to get to the bargaining table with the union, which 
says it's decertified, should be the NFL's new television contract, for $3.64 
billion over four years. It will nearly double each team's annual television 
income -- from $17 million last season to an average of $32 million.
